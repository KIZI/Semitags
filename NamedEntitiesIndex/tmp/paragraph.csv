12#1,"Anarchism is a political philosophy that advocates stateless societies based on non-hierarchical free associations.\"That is why Anarchy, when it works to destroy authority in all its aspects, when it demands the abrogation of laws and the abolition of the mechanism that serves to impose them, when it refuses all hierarchical organization and preaches free agreement — at the same time strives to maintain and enlarge the precious kernel of social customs without which no human or animal society can exist.\" Peter Kropotkin. Anarchism: its philosophy and ideal\"anarchists are opposed to irrational (e.g., illegitimate) authority, in other words, hierarchy — hierarchy being the institutionalisation of authority within a society.\" \"B.1 Why are anarchists against authority and hierarchy?\" in [[An Anarchist FAQ]]\"ANARCHISM, a social philosophy that rejects authoritarian government and maintains that voluntary institutions are best suited to express man's natural social tendencies.\" George Woodcock. \"Anarchism\" at The Encyclopedia of Philosophy\"In a society developed on these lines, the voluntary associations which already now begin to cover all the fields of human activity would take a still greater extension so as to substitute themselves for the state in all its functions.\" [[Peter Kropotkin]. \"Anarchism\" from the Encyclopædia Britannica] Anarchism holds the state to be undesirable, unnecessary, or harmful.\n\n\n\nThe following sources cite anarchism as a political philosophy:\n\n"
12#2,"As a subtle and anti-dogmatic philosophy, anarchism draws on many currents of thought and strategy. Anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view, instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy. and much of anarchist economics and anarchist legal philosophy reflect anti-authoritarian interpretations of communism, collectivism, syndicalism, mutualism, or participatory economics.\"The anarchists were unanimous in subjecting authoritarian socialism to a barrage of severe criticism. At the time when they made violent and satirical attacks these were not entirely well founded, for those to whom they were addressed were either primitive or “vulgar” communists, whose thought had not yet been fertilized by Marxist humanism, or else, in the case of Marx and Engels themselves, were not as set on authority and state control as the anarchists made out.\" Daniel Guerin, Anarchism: From Theory to Practice (New York: Monthly Review Press, 1970)"
