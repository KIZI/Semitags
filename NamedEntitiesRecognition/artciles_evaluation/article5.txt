BlackRock Earnings Per Share Rise 7 Percent

BlackRock outperformed expectations in the first quarter, notching a $575 million profit as markets surged and the economy breathed new signs of life.

With earnings of $3.16 a share, up 7 percent from the first quarter of 2011, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, easily beat the estimates of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, who had estimated $3.03 a share.

The figures are adjusted for one-time items. Excluding those, BlackRock earned $572 million, or $3.14 a share, up nearly 1 percent from the same period a year ago.

BlackRock’s assets under management, one of the most important measures of the company’s strength as a money management firm, rose 1 percent. The gains, BlackRock said, reflected improved investment returns and the firm’s recent acquisition of Claymore Investments.

“Our first quarter 2012 results are a strong testament to the power of BlackRock’s diversified business model and history of innovation,” Laurence D. Fink, BlackRock’s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.

Still, BlackRock’s revenue dipped to $2.2 billion, down 1 percent from $2.3 billion in the same period a year ago. The modest change reflected a slight dip in performance fees, as well as some other charges.

As one of the largest asset managers, BlackRock’s fate is often intertwined with the markets. The stock market was on fire in the first quarter, guiding BlackRock to strong results.

The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index recorded its largest first-quarter gains since 1998, producing a 12 percent rally. The Dow Jones industrial average has notched sixth months of gains.

“For most of the first quarter of 2012, we saw renewed confidence in global markets,” Mr. Fink said.
