Europe Stocks Open Lower

LONDON—European stocks opened lower Monday as investors consolidated some of last week's gains ahead of some key events later in the week, while increased political uncertainty in Europe also weighed on confidence.

London's FTSE 100 Index opened 0.7% lower at 5732.42, Germany's DAX index was down 1.23% at 6666 and Paris's CAC 40 Index decreased by 1.1% to 3153.25.

The political landscape in Europe will be in focus following weekend events in France and the Netherlands. The first round of the French presidential elections held Sunday confirmed that the two front-runners—President Nicolas Sarkozy and opposition candidate François Hollande—will go on to the second round. The preliminary results showed Hollande ahead with 28.8% of the votes, compared with Sarkozy's 26.1%. If elected, Mr. Hollande will call for the renegotiation of the European treaty on fiscal discipline.

In the Netherlands, early elections look likely, following the collapse of budget talks.

Meanwhile, traders note a degree of caution ahead of meetings by the Bank of Japan and the Federal Open Market Committee late in the week, both of which could announce new easing measures.

"The increase in the International Monetary Fund's funding by $430 billion will be absorbed well by the market given that it adds another layer of firepower to provide help to the euro-zone periphery should it be required. Nonetheless, many other worries continue to afflict markets suggesting that any positive boost will be short lived," said Crédit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank.

"There are certainly plenty of sources for market friction including intensifying concerns about the fiscal/debt situation in Spain, the ability to pass reforms in Italy, renewed U.S. growth concerns and slowing growth in China," added Crédit Agricole.

Also Monday, investors in Europe will get their first chance to react to China's preliminary HSBC Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, which showed a rise to a two-month high of 49.1 in April compared with a final reading of 48.3 in March. Market participants pointed out that while there was an improvement, the index remains in contractionary territory for the sixth straight month.

In terms of economic data, German and euro-zone PMI surveys are due at 7.30 a.m. GMT and 8 a.m. GMT respectively.

On Wall Street Friday, the Dow industrials rose after better-than-forecast quarterly reports from Microsoft and General Electric pushed blue chips to their first weekly gain this month, while Apple's slide helped lead the technology-oriented Nasdaq into the red.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5% to 13,029.26 and the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index advanced 0.1% to 1378.53.

In Asia, however, stock markets were mostly lower Monday amid a lack of positive catalysts, while manufacturing data in China failed to dispel concerns of weakness in Asia's largest economy.

Japan's Nikkei Stock Average declined 0.1%, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slid 0.2%, South Korea's Kospi Composite fell 0.3%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index lost 0.6%, China's Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.2% and India's Sensex was up 0.2%.

In the European foreign exchanges, the euro was weaker against the dollar. The common currency was recently trading at $1.3180, from $1.3215 late Friday in New York. "The euro will have to contend with political events as it digests the aftermath of the first round of the French presidential elections. The fact that the political process will continue to a second round on 6 May could act as a constraint on the euro," said Crédit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank. The euro and the dollar exchange rate "will largely remain within its recent range although developments in Spain and Italy and their debt markets will have the potential to invoke larger moves in the euro," it added. The dollar was at ¥81.29 from ¥81.55.

Among commodities, spot gold was at $1641.10 a troy ounce, up 40 cents from New York, while June Nymex crude oil futures were down 14 cents at $103.74 per barrel and June Brent futures were down seven cents at $118.69.

In the bond markets the June bund futures contract was up 42 ticks at 140.80.
