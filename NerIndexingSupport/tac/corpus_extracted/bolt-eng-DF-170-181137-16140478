I find that 95% of people who have a plan for a college football playoff have a plan that is totally unrealistic. Nearly 100% of these people rarely or never go to a college football game.

I have to agree that LSU/Bama playing for the National Championship fails... but what would you do about it?
 
 
Let it be known: I absolutely detest Jordan Jefferson.
 
 
The BCS Championship game was a showcase of defensive football. If you wanted teams scoring 50 or 60 points, I am sure you were disappointed.

As far as "seen better", perhaps you have seen teams score more. But there are very few college football defenses that were even in the same league as what was shown in that game.
 
 
They both sucked
 
 
 
They both sucked

 

Yeah yeah yeah. Thats what you have said before.

But LSU hung 40 points on Oregon, who were ranked #4 in the final AP poll. (40-27)

LSU scored 41 points against Arkansas, who ended the year at #5 on the AP. (41-17)

LSU burned W.VA for 47 points, and the Mountaineers were ranked #17 after kicking Clemson's ass. (47-21)

LSU beat Georgia 42-10 after being down 10-0 at the half. Georgia ended the year ranked #19 in the AP poll.

And against Alabama they scored 0 points. They only got beyond the 50 yardline once. And that was in the 4th quarter, after which they were promptly slapped backwards.

Bama, meanwhile, played an almost perfect game. Only one touchdown, but scored 5 times on field goals, held the #1 team completely in check, had only one penalty for 5 yards late in the 4th quarter, and did not turn the ball over against a defense that prided itself on creating turnovers.

As I have said numerous times, it was not a high flying offensive football game. But it was a defesnive showcase. Both defenses looked stout during most of the game. (LSU's defense was simply worn-out by the end of the 3rd quarter).

LSU was #1 in the AP for 11 weeks in a row. You may not have liked the game, but to claim both teams sucked is simply BS. The two best teams in college football for the 2011 season were on that field.

NCAA is run by a bunch of short sighted idiots

They are in love with their bowl games which are nothing but exhibition games. They dont mean anything because they don't prove anything

Who cares if the number 3 team from one conference beats the number 2 team from another?

And why would you have a regular season, stop in November and then pick it up again in January?
 
 
The best college team of all time was the 1972 USC Trojans - Newsweek had an articleon them titled "Southern Cals Super Bowl." (the best team that has ever been coached???)

You say this because you're not a college football fan. You may love football and you may follow college football, but there's not a team that you go and watch on Saturday. If you did you would understand the rationale behind the bowl game schedules.

I've heard alot of cocakmamie schemes for a college football playoff over the years. Go ahead and tell us yours. Just keep in mind 3 things.

1. All post-season football games have to serve alcohol to be financially realistic.
2. People have to be given some notice to be able to make plans to travel 1000+ miles to attend a game.
3. Attendance is really important and it's the biggest problem most bowl games have.

Now tell me your plan, since you're so much smarter than the NCAA idiots.

This is going to be hard....

Eight teams are selected for the Div 1 playoffs after conference championships are completed. That means there are seven games to play that actually mean something. The rest of the teams can play meaningless bowl games if they want to feel important

Rose Bowl, Sugar Bowl, Orange Bowl, Fiesta Bowl, Cotton Bowl and two at large bowls are selected to host. First round (4 games) happens mid December two weeks after the regular season ends. Second round (2 games) are held New Years Day, Rose Bowl is one of these games. Championship is held mid January at a rotating site like the SuperBowl.

1 Beer is mandatory of course

2 Fans have two weeks notice to buy tickets and make travel arrangements. NFL fans do it. NCAA Basketball fans do it. If you can't make it, someone else will buy the ticket. Stub Hub is amazing at filling seats

3 Attendance and TV ratings will go through the roof because the games are not for bragging rights, they lead to a championship

I bet my way makes more money and draws more nationwide interest than a hodgepodge of meaningless bowls

I don't see short notice as being much of a detriment to the tournament. The SEC Championship is often not locked until the final game of the season, which is only a week away from the Championship.

College football has fans unlike any other game. We are fanatics. If you have our team in a bowl game, we will fill the stands (with or without beer).

'Bout as cockamamie as all the rest. There are alot of problems here - so I'll just start with one.

The Rose Bowl is a game between the PAC champ and the B1G champ. Despite the fact that that it's played on a PAC home field the B1G just seems to love the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. The only real reason we have a BCS is because my beloved Huskers gave the B1G fits back in '94 and '97.... they still didn't give up their stinkin' Rose Bowl. Maybe one of these years my Huskers will thump the Buffs in the Rose Bowl. That would be the one game I never would have expected in a million years.

So the Bowl Games aren't owned by the NCAA and the NCAA only has limited control over what it can tell them they can and cannot do. The Orange Bowl isn't going to be played on 12/15.

I'll ignore the numerous other problems with your system temporarily and focus a bit on how you feel that you would select your "Eight Teams". Here are the week 15 rankings from 2011. I presume the season is still fresh in your mind.

Who gets a shot and who doesn't? How are the eight selected? How are they seeded?

1 LSU 13-0
2 Alabama 11-1
3 Oklahoma State 11-1
4 Stanford 11-1
5 Oregon 11-2
6 Arkansas 10-2
7 Boise State 11-1
8 Kansas State 10-2
9 South Carolina 10-2
10 Wisconsin 11-2
11 Virginia Tech 11-2
12 Baylor 9-3
13 Michigan 10-2
14 Oklahoma 9-3
15 Clemson 10-3
16 Georgia 10-3
17 Michigan State 10-3
18 TCU 10-2
19 Houston 12-1
20 Nebraska 9-3
21 Southern Miss 11-2

They drive.

Like my Huskers turning Notre Dame Stadium into a sea of red - if they can drive they will go. Southerners are accustomed to driving to Atlanta for one reason or another from time to time.

Hold the SEC championship in Seattle and see what happens.

Nope. Bowl games are mostly sparsely attended. I don't think you're going to get too many college football fan bases who can represent a good crowd at 3 separate contests in faraway cities. I was in Yankee Stadium in December and Rutgers couldn't make a good showing in their own back yard.

We drive? Alabama took 30,000 fans to a game in hawaii. Hold it in Seattle and we'll fill the place to the rafters. In the BCS Championship in Pasadena CA there were over 94,000 fans in attendance. Tuscaloosa is a bit over 2,000 miles from Pasadena, and Austin Texas is almost 1,400 miles from the Rose Bowl. And the Rose Bowl lists its seating capacity as 90,000+.

Sorry, but I remain completely unconvinced

First off.....the Rose Bowl is a joke. nobody cares. If a Pac 10 or Big 10 team makes the BCS Championship game(think USC) they get the second place team. So what have they proved? The Bowls may own the game, but they don't own the teams that play in them. Rose Bowl doesnt want to play in the Championship format? Let them arrange to get teams outside the top 8 and see how their attendance is

Conferences are also a joke right now with teams jumping back and forth. It would not be hard to rearrange conferences to fit in an at championship format.

How to pick teams? Needs to be worked out. You could go straight BCS type ranking 1 through 8. Or you could give select super conferences (5 teams) automatic bids and select the other 3 at large. Seeding by committee

Still better than selecting an LSU - Alabama rematch

Now, give me a real reason an eight team playoff format won't work. Your reasoning has been pretty lame so far

I would not be so foolish as to imply that my Huskers were better than the Tide in 2011. The Saban-era Tide have been very, very good. Much better than my Huskers. Congrats on that - I really mean it.

I wouldn't say that the Tide faithful travel any better than Husker fans do. I don't know if you travel with the Tide but I do travel with the Huskers and I can tell you that the turn out for games requiring a flight is not nearly as good as games that can be reached by driving. That doesn't mean the Huskers won't travel far and wide to watch our team play. A couple years back we invaded Victoria, BC one Sunday because so many of us decided to just day trip there after the UW game. It's like a 3 hour ferry ride but we just all decided to do it, so you had a bunch of Husker Red walking around Canada. Pretty funny.

The Conference Championship that used to be in Kansas City - that was no problem. We'll have to wait and see how many Husker faithfull will make the trip to Indy.

Son, I'm not the one who needs to be convincing you. It's the other way around. I don't contend that an 8 team playoff is impossible. Your 8 team playoff would never work because you didn't think it through completely or carefeully.

The Rose Bowl may be a joke to you, but the B1G loves it and therefore it will persevere. I know that you think that the SEC will continue to enjoy permanent domination of college football from now unti eternity, but something tells me that some team from one of those other minor confrences, the B1G, the Big 12, the PAC 12, the ACC - just maybe one of them will manage to field a halfway decent team one of these years.

I don't see why half the best teams in college football would be willing to risk ending their seasons in mid-December and I don't see why the best bowls would give up their coveted January slots. The financial implications of one team winning 3 bowl games are unsettling. It sounds like the richest gettting much richer.

So I ask again - you have the 2011 week 15 rankings right there. Who would play whom and where and when? How would your 8 team playoff work. We already established that you have relegated the Big East to "minor conference" status.

Right now, only two teams have a shot at a National Championship after Thanksgiving. Then they close up shop, wait for six weeks and play a game in the second week of January. Are you telling me that six other teams would not be willing to play in mid- December if it meant a shot at a national title and possibly more playoff games?
Are you telling me that fans would not come to those games?
Are you telling me that TV ratings and sponsorships would not be much higher than with existing bowls?

Let's look at 2011

Let's put the championship in the Fiesta Bowl

Semi finals in Rose Bowl (New Years Day) and Sugar Bowl

First Round (Mid December): Cotton Bowl, Orange Bowl, Atlanta and New Jersey

Seed the teams 1-8 and go at it
 
 
 
Are you telling me that TV ratings and sponsorships would not be much higher than with existing bowls?

Let's look at 2011

 

Let's.

The BCS selects 10 teams. Presumably in your 8 team field you would not have chosen the Big East Winner (WV) or the lowest ranked at-large (Michigan). Taking the remaining 8 and doing a conventional seeding where lowest plays highest we would get:

LSU 1 v. Clemson 15
Stanford 4 v. Oregon 5

Alabama 2 v. Virginia Tech 11
Oklahoma State 3 v. Wisconsin 10

Okie State/Wisconsin is the only good game of the 4.

Stanford/Oregon had just played the Pac championship.

 
First Round (Mid December): Cotton Bowl, Orange Bowl, Atlanta and New Jersey

 

New Jersey? Like the Meadowlands? That makes no sense. We don't do college football around here.

You complain that the LSU/Bama rematch was lame and college football should have a playoff, but a playoff probably would have resulted in the same thing.... A Bama/LSU rematch.

When you look at it that way, March Madness sucks

so do the NFL Playoffs

But they seem to do pretty well with the fans

The NFL Playoffs are contested on the home field of the higher seeded team, so only a small percentage of attendees will travel to be there.

If the first round of a college football playoff was attended like the first weekend of March Madness then I would say an 8 team playoff would be a very big mistake. I don't think more than 25% of the seats are filled in most first weekend March Madness games.

Besides, looking at 2011, a 4 team playoff would obviously have sufficed. A "BCS+1" format that pits the #4 team vs #1 and #3 vs #2 and then the winners play each other would have been perfect for 2011.

Bama v. Okie State
Stanford v. LSU

(But the +1 bowl still would have been Bama/LSU.)

And still that wouldn't stop the possibility of teams playing each other back-to-back on neutral fields in championship games.

In these lists - ND gets the 47 team (before I was born)

1988 team - had some sqeekers butfinished up strong - beating #2 USC 27-10 in the LA Colisuem - then winning easily against West Virgina in the Fiesta Bowl.

But how about the1966 team?? Won the concensus NC - gave up under 40 points the entire season.

After they beat Okla in Norman - one sooner said - "it was like playing against the Green Bay Packers."

And if we were talking about the history of college football you might have a point.

But this is about current college football teams and the recent BCS National Championship. The two best teams in the country (that played in 2011) were on the field in New Orleans. And the best team took home the championship. Thats how it works. Not only do you have to win, but you have to win at teh right time.
 
 
 
In these lists - ND gets the 47 team (before I was born)

1988 team - had some sqeekers butfinished up strong - beating #2 USC 27-10 in the LA Colisuem - then winning easily against West Virgina in the Fiesta Bowl.

But how about the1966 team?? Won the concensus NC - gave up under 40 points the entire season.

Also, ND should never have been the NC in '66. They played Michigan State, and were tied with 1:10 left in the game and Ara played for the tie. Both ND and Michigan St finished the year 9-0-1, while Bama finished 10-0.

Oh, and while ND held their opponents to a total of 38 points, Bama held theirs to 37 for the season.

The reason ND was given that trophy had less to do with football and more to do with politics and race relations.
 
 
ND beat USC 51- 0 after the Mich St tie.

Yeah, they beat a team ranked #10, while Bama beat the #6 team 34-7.

So Bama beat a higher ranked team and had a better record. It was during the era of civil rights battles and the Crimson Tide paid the price for that.

Well, that and too many people didn't want to see the Crimson Tide win 3 NCs in a row.

Nah, Bama's defense that year would have killed ND. And Ken Stabler was at his best that year.
 
 
I doubt that.

ND in 1966 was one of the best CF teams of all times.

They would have annihaledc bama.

Best of all time? Couldn't win them all though. Alabama won all their games and allowed one fewer points to be scored.
 
 
I can see you point of view.
 
 
 
The 95 Cornhuskers couldn't pass. Were exposed by Arizona St in the first game in 1996 when they got SHUT-OUT.

 

Ignorant and inaccurate.

1. The ASU game in '96 was the second game of the season.
2. The QB in '95 was Tommie Frazier. The QB in '96 was Scott Frost. I'll leave it to you to decide whether Tommie could pass or not, but Scott was an excellent drop back passer.
3. The '96 Nebraska Cornhuskers lost 2 games (one was their conference championship) and finished ranked #6. Not bad for a rebuilding year. They won the National Championship with Scott the next year in '97.

ND played by far a tougher scheule in 1966 than Alabama.

The SEC of 1966 wasn't the SEC of today.

Mediocre at best/lilly-white.

ND would have a 30 lb advantage on them on the line of scrimmage.

When Rocky Bleir and Bubba Smith did a retrospective show on ESPN on The Game Of The Century - even Smith stated that Bamas arguements were sour grapes -and that both ND and Mich St would have handily beat Bama.
 
 
You could put ND 1977 in the discussion of bestteams.

Once Devinve put in Montana as the starting QB.....................................................................

I agree with this. Segregated football teams really can't compare to desgregated football teams. Football isn't baseball. It's very hard to put any segregated football team on a the best-of-all-time list.
 
 
 
 
The best college team of all time was the 1972 USC Trojans - Newsweek had an articleon them titled "Southern Cals Super Bowl." (the best team that has ever been coached???)

 

I like that you state it as if it were fact. And just as an FYI, the youngest players from the '72 team would be 59 years old, so I doubt they would have made much of a showing in January.

According to this link Nebraska's '71 teams is the #1 team of all time. But your '72 USC team came in second.  ESPN.com - Page2 - Best college football teams of all time 

According to this link, Nebraska's '95 team is the beat of all time. The Miami '01 team was second and your team was ranked 3rd.  PARADE Magazine | Parade.com 

This link lists the '95 Nebraska squad as the best ever too, but your '72 USC team is #5.
 Greatest College Football Teams of All Time (Single Season) 

Wow, another link showing Nebraska's '95 team as the best.
 All-time greatest college football teams: Ten all-time greatest college football teams - Sun Sentinel 

But this is all nonsense. This is not the first time you have posted claims about some team from the 70s in response to current football champions. Even if the '72 USC squad was the best ever, this does not mean both teams sucked. You just hate the SEC.

But the upside is that you got to see an SEC team lose in the BCS championship game. That has never happened in the history of the BCS.

 

I think that USC in 1972 would have defeated the Miami Dolphins.

As big, faster and more talented.
 
 
I am sure most of you have seen the story about the National Championship Trophy being shattered in Tuscaloosa over the weekend? A player's father tripped and knocked it over.

Which just goes to show, you can't trip in Tuscaloosa without hitting a NC trophy.

I also heard the University of Alabama is sending the shattered remains to LSU, to commemorate how their season ended.

Figures.

A forgettable team.

Bama is notorious for National Championship Inflation.

They claim NCs even for the mostminor polls.

Notre Dame only claims NCs for the major polls they finished #1.

Forgettable? Only one team has ever shut-out their opponent when playing in a BCS Bowl game. You can TRY to forget that, but most folks won't.

I laugh at this sort of nonsense. It is funny to me that you consider the Helms poll valid and then claim the Davis Poll or Dunkel or Houlgate polls are somehow invalid?? lol

But lets forget all the old polls that you want to dispute. Since WWII, Alabama has only claimed NationalChampionships in which they were named that by the AP or the BCS,

In that time Notre Dame has won 7, and Alabama has won 9. The AP has named Notre Dame the NC 8 times and has named Bama 9 times.

Notre Dame's last NC was in 1988. Since that time Alabama has won 3 national Championships.

Oh, and since you claim to put so much weight behind certain polls, its funny that teh AP gave Bama the NC for this last season.

So yeah, we have some trophies around Tuscaloosa. Nice of you to see the humor in my post. But I guess a hater has to try and make stuff up to put the winners down.

ND was awarded the MacArther Bowl in 1964 (#1) - but they didnt claim it as a NC.

I guess they saw how ND got hosed against USC.

They deserved the NC in 93 - they beat Florida St.

(and they beat you guys back-to-back in major bowls games in 74 and75)

Is reading comprehension a handicap for you? I believe I said something about only using the AP and the BCS since WWII?? Alabama does not claim any championship year since then that was not awarded by the AP.

Yeah, you want to rework old polls but argue when someone else does it. You claim the AP is right when they put Notre Dame on top, but claim they robbed them when they don't.

Again, you beat us in back-to-back bowls almost 40 years ago. Who cares?? If all you have is ancient history, then start a thread about historical football games and leave the recent winnings to those who still win.
