Stick a fork in state Sen. Hiram Monserrate,
because he is done.

On second thought, maybe it would be better to keep all sharp
objects far away from the Queens Democrat, who will likely face a
vote to expel him from the chamber as a result of the December 2008
incident in which his girlfriend's face was cut.

Last Thursday, a special Senate committee of inquiry recommended
that the full body should consider two options: censuring
Monserrate and stripping him of all privileges, or booting him
altogether.

In a time of bitter partisanship, both sides in the New York
Senate have achieved a Kumbaya moment on the question of
Monserrate's ouster. He could mount a legal challenge to the
chamber's right to bounce him, but state courts are highly
reluctant to meddle in the internal workings of a co-equal branch
of government -- even one as tempestuous as the state Senate.

There are a number of options, all of which suggest it will be a
bad year for ulcers and high blood pressure among legislators and
staff.

For Democrats, the doomsday scenario would be if any of
Monserrate's few remaining friends in the Senate react to his
expulsion by flipping to the Republicans, handing them leadership
of the chamber. At the top of that list we would have to put Sens.
Ruben Diaz Sr. and Pedro Espada Jr., who with Sen. Carl Kruger and
Monserrate form the opportunist's guild known as the Four Amigos.

But Diaz responds badly to the GOP's brand of political
discipline, and Republicans would be extremely wary of going back
into the honeymoon suite with Espada, who left them heartbroken at
the end of last summer's coup to become the Democratic majority
leader. (Pause here if nausea occurs.)

Also, Espada's own long-gestating legal troubles recently ramped
up appreciably when Attorney General Andrew Cuomo's office dropped
a bombshell legal filing that alleged the senator has used his
not-for-profit health care network as a personal and political ATM
machine. There might be a committee of inquiry in his future, too.

In the second scenario for the Monserrate interregnum, the
absence of a quorum on either side of the aisle results in complete
and utter gridlock in which Republicans deny Democrats the lone
vote they would need to pass any legislation -- including the budget
bills that are ostensibly due by the end of March. Republican
senators could merely sit on their hands and wait for Monserrate's
replacement to show up. What they're really waiting for, of course,
is November.

To neutralize that strategy, Senate Democrats will have to
forego the closed-door tactics that got them in trouble during last
year's budget. Senate Conference Leader John Sampson made a good
start in this effort earlier this month by enticing two GOP
senators, George Maziarz and Tom Morahan, to accept committee
chairmanships.

As their more honest members would admit, the Democrats have
been far too slow to recognize that their political future depends
on turning away from the loose cannons in their own ranks and
appealing to moderates on the other side.

The Senate's reputation might depend on its expulsion of
Monserrate, but the state's survival might depend on the formation
of a coalition of grown-ups.
