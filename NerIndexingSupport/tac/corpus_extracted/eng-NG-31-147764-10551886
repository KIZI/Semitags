To all Hilltop Yankee Fans

It was a sad day for the National Pastime yesterday, and a sad day for fans of the Bronx Bombers (yes, you, too, Box).

Is there a taint to some of the recent flags for the Yanks with the outing of Roger Clemens, Andy Petitte, Gary Sheffield, Chuck Knobloch, David Justice, Mike Stanton, etc., who were pretty important members of those teams?  And do we better understand the Clemens bat throwing incident towards Piazza?  Was this just an incient of 'roid rage?

Will Rocket see the inside of Cooperstown without buying a ticket?  Will Sheffield?  Will Bonds do time?

By the way, was anyone surprised to see Lenny Dykstra on the list?  I mean, he went from being a scrawny kid to the Incredible Hulk in about 6 months.....duh....

Sadly, this is not likely the end of this nonsense, but more like the beginning of the evelations and incriminations.  too bad.  With pitchers and catchers just two short months away, one would wish to focus on th joy of the game, not the tarnish of the syringes....
