Yup.  It's true.  It's ALL Bu$h's fault.

Bu$h had plenty of warning before 911 -- more than 7 months after
inauguration to do something, but he couldn't be bothered.  It's ALL Bu
$h's fault.

Bu$h even sat for 7 long minutes lip reading "My Pet Goat" after
getting news (if it even was news) of the 911 attacks on the morning
of 911.

Bu$h spent the rest of the day flying around the country in a dither.
It's ALL Bu$h's fault.

Bu$h led AmeriKKKa on the downward path away from Afghanistan and to
his totally bogus Iraq War that is doomed to fail.  It's ALL Bu$h's
fault.

If there's any lesson for AmeriKKKa and the world to take away from
this sad 6th anniversary of 911 -- let it be that IT'S ALL BU$H'S
FAULT!!!

Gospel.
