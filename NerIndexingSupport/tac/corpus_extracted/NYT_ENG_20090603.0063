      OBAMA-MIDEAST-SPEECH (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia) -- Aiming to repair
the American relationship with the Muslim world, President Barack
Obama was greeted on Wednesday with reminders of the vast gulfs he
must bridge, as voices as disparate as al-Qaida's and the Israeli
government's competed in trying to shape how Obama's message would
be heard. In a new audiotape, Osama bin Laden condemned Obama for
planting what he called new seeds of "hatred and vengeance" among
Muslims, while in Jerusalem, senior Israeli officials complained
that Obama was rewriting old understandings by taking a harder line
against new Israeli settlements. A speech that Obama is to deliver
early Thursday in Cairo is intended to make good on a two-year-old
promise to use a major Muslim capital as the scene for a major
address. But whether the president's expected call for the United
States and Islam to come together can trump bin Laden's call to
arms is a question that could define Obama's presidency in the
years to come. By Jeff Zeleny and Helene Cooper.

      GOVERNMENT-DEBT (Undated) -- As the financial crisis continues,
governments around the world are finding themselves in the same
situation as many individuals who borrow more to make ends meet:
They are having to pay higher interest rates on their growing debt.
The additional cost for countries -- from the United States to
Britain to Germany -- will mean hundreds of billions of dollars
annually in interest expense for many years to come, at a time when
governments are already seeing their budget deficits soar. By John
Schwartz.

      FOLD

      TIANANMEN-SOLDIER (Beijing) -- Soaked in sweat, his heart racing,
Chen Guang descended the steps of China's Great Hall of the People
and aimed his automatic rifle at the sea of student protesters
occupying Tiananmen Square. A 17-year-old soldier from the
countryside, Chen and his comrades had just been given chilling
orders: to clear the symbolic heart of the nation, even if it meant
spilling blood. Twenty years after Chinese troops shot their way
into the center of Beijing, killing hundreds of people and wounding
many more, Chen provided a rare window into the military crackdown
that re-established the Communist Party's supremacy after six weeks
of mass unrest and then, for most Chinese, disappeared in an
official whitewash. Speaking publicly for the first time -- and
defying security officials who have told him to keep silent -- he
said, "I can assure you I didn't shoot anyone." By Andrew Jacobs.

      DRUGS-AFFORD (Rocky Mount, N.C.) -- Even with a new Medicare drug
benefit, even with the prevalence of low-cost generics, even with
loss-leader discounting by big chains, many Americans still find
themselves unable to afford the prescription medications that
manage their life-threatening conditions. By Kevin Sack.

      SCOTUS-REPUBS (Washington) -- Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, was not
happy when he heard other Republicans toss around terms like racist
in reference to Judge Sonia Sotomayor, the Supreme Court nominee.
As the senator who holds the job responsible for Republican Senate
races, Cornyn worried that such disparaging attacks on the nation's
first Hispanic high court nominee could undo his party with an
increasingly important voting bloc. By Carl Hulse.

      TERROR-IMMIG (Moore Haven, Fla.) -- In April, a federal jury
acquitted Youssef Megahed on explosives charges stemming from a
road trip with a friend who had packed model-rocket propellants in
the trunk. But three days later, in the parking lot of a Wal-Mart
in Tampa, Megahed was arrested again, this time by immigration
authorities. The new charge is that he "is engaged in or is likely
to engage in" terrorist activities, a violation of his legal
residency in the United States. "They just label you a terrorist
and that's it," said Megahed, 23, who moved to Florida from Egypt
with his family 11 years ago and is being held here at an
immigration detention center. Megahed is at least the third Florida
defendant in three years to be brought up on immigration charges
after prosecutors failed to win terrorism convictions in federal
court. If convicted of the new charges and deported, he would join
thousands of other Muslim and Arab men sent home since Sept. 11,
2001, as part of an extensive law-enforcement strategy that relies
on the immigration courts to remove potential threats. By Damien
Cave.

      INSIDE STORIES PROMOTED ON PAGE 1

      HURRICANE-TRAILERS (Undated) -- Hurricane Katrina victims around
the Gulf Coast who were told to vacate their temporary trailers by
the end of May will instead be allowed to buy them for $5 or less,
White House officials announced on Wednesday. The Department of
Housing and Urban Development will also give the 3,450 families
still in trailers or temporary housing -- including many elderly,
poor and disabled people -- priority for $50 million in permanent
housing vouchers. The money for the vouchers was appropriated by
Congress last year. By Shaila Dewan.

      NH-GAY-MARRIAGE (Boston) -- The New Hampshire Legislature
approved revisions to a same-sex marriage bill on Wednesday and
Gov. John Lynch promptly signed the legislation, making the state
the sixth in the nation to let gay couples wed. The bill had been
through several permutations in an effort to satisfy Lynch and
certain legislators that it would not force members of religious
groups that oppose gay marriage to participate in ceremonies
celebrating it. By Abby Goodnough.

      ISRAEL-SETTLEMENTS (Jerusalem) -- Senior Israeli officials
expressed irritation on Wednesday that President Barack Obama had
declined to acknowledge what they called clear understandings with
the Bush administration that allowed Israel to build West Bank
settlement housing within certain guidelines while still publicly
claiming to honor a settlement "freeze." The complaint was the
latest in a growing rift between the Obama administration and the
government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over how to move
forward to achieve Middle East peace. By Ethan Bronner.

      KOREA-BORDER (Taekwang Village, South Korea) -- The soldiers
stationed at the bunkers and outposts along this stretch of the
demilitarized zone that divides the two Koreas are on hair-trigger
alert as they look across at a nuclear-armed North. But on a recent
morning, they were visited by 120 civilians, mostly young women,
who arrived in bright red and white buses. The group was on a
so-called discipline tour, a common practice by paternalistic South
Korean companies to build employee spirit and unity, usually with
mountain hikes or trips to amusement parks. By Martin Fackler.

      BKN-FOULS (Undated) -- A nagging question is dominating the NBA
playoffs, and it has nothing to do with who will win the
championship. The question: When is a flagrant foul not a flagrant
foul? The answer: When it is changed the next day. Referees have
called 16 flagrant fouls this spring. Seven were later downgraded
by the commissioner's office. Seven other flagrant fouls have been
issued retroactively -- long after the final buzzers sounded and the
arenas emptied out. The stated goal is to get the calls right, but
that high-minded policy has been met with frustration and
confusion. Players are not sure what constitutes a flagrant foul.
Coaches go to sleep wondering if their player might be suspended
the next day, even if no infraction was called during the game.
When everything is reviewable, no call seems final. By Howard Beck
and Jonathan Abrams.
