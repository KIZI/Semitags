The US has many enemies but she also has many allies. I am curious to know who you all think the US's closest ally is. I don't necessarily means her strongest ally but her most loyal one. All of the choices I have put up as choices are close allies with the US. As for my vote I am not sure. I am torn between England, Canada, and Australia.
 
 
UK, not even close.

I keep waiting for them to ask for statehood to save themselves from the Insanity of the EU...not that i'd want them added as a state. Too many stinking lefties.  
 
 
Should be Canada, is UK by a landslide.

I agree.
 
 
I wouldn't say it's the UK, but I suppose it depends on whether you mean the government or the people it is supposed to represent.

Interesting poll though. It'll be interesting to see which nationalities vote for which country.
 
 
It's the UK, then Canada (don't they build some M1A2s there?), then Israel though I wouldn't discount France entirely. In the Revolutionary War and War of 1812, their help was invaluable. As of late, they seem to have an odd streak of nationalism mixed with kneejerk anti-americanism and lackadaisical policies towards problems at home (sluggish economy, problems w/ minorities, etc.) amd abroad (terrorism, EU constitution and expansions) that all come in a package called Gaulism. Japan one might say, given its pacifist constitution and what not, is a very reliable ally today. Australia is definitely a very reliable ally IMO.
 
 
"don't they build some M1A2s there?"

Unless that's a very recent development, no.
 
 
 
Should be Canada, is UK by a landslide.

 

Normally I would agree but apparently the leftwing brigade here has tarnished that title.

In order I would say:

UK
Isreal
Austrailia
Canada

France, well they will always be French....
 
 
Australia is VERY good as an ally, because although they don't bring a lot of physical strength to the table, philosophically they're true-blue and loyal.

Howard was just returned as Australian Prime Minister, and he is very closely identified with Dubya.

Contrast that with Tony Blair, who, although a strong and loyal ally, has to fight the 'Bush's Poodle' slander, and in so doing has sometimes had to distance himself and show his independence of the US for doemstic political considerations.

So the Brits are sacrificing and actually doing the heavy lifting in the War on Terror right alongside of us - but the grumble and ***** the whole way. Aussies aren't making as much of a contribution, but I have a sense they don't resent what they are doing, and wouldn't mind all that much if they were asked to do even more.
 
 
UK without a doubt is #1 followed by Australia.
 
 
I didn't want to get into a fracas.

Israel is the actual friend of the US.

Without Israel, the US would have no influence in the ME; and not only the Israeli govt but also the Israeli population has always stood solidly behind the US.

Now tell me which other country has done so - solidly, that is!

I agree that we are very close allies, and Israel is currently the only country in that region that is not a moral cripple and shares most of our values and political system. They are the only democratic state in the region, and they enjoy all the fruits of freedom with very little of the pathologies of their enemies that surround them on all sides.

But Israel is chiefly concerned with what's best for ISRAEL. I understand that completely, and I don't resent it one bit, given what stakes they play for. If the US and Israel are close, it's because we're important to them. If we weren't, I don't think we could count on Israeli support internationally.

This differs from the 'Anglosphere' countries that support the US almost out of shared heritage and philosophies alone.
 
 
Bluesman, you have a point, although in the "Anglosphere", with the possible exception of Australia, it is a moral liability to be seen as pro-US. In Israel, it is only natural to be pro-US. Being the most isolated country in the UN, the Israelis realize how much worse a position they would be in without the US (if Israel would exist at all), a perception that doesn't really exist in the Anglosphere countries. There are approximately 600,000 Israelis with American citizenship, and I think something like 80% of Israelis backed Bush when polls were done around the world. So in terms of philosophies, the Israelis are not too different from the US (have the whole "fuk France" attitude too). But you are right that when push comes to shove the Israelis are looking out for the Israelis.

Thanks for the back-up, Boxcar. What you said ("...in the "Anglosphere", with the possible exception of Australia, it is a moral liability to be seen as pro-US.) circles back to my point that we can count on the Aussies, but who knows if Blair can hold on for another election? If he can't, we all know why he will have been defeated - close identification with Bush, which is, as you've said, a moral (and I should add, a political) liability.

So, my point was and is: Australia is a more dependable ally than the UK. Because if the Brits change their government (very possible), it will be largely for one reason, and at that point, the US is the third rail to the new Brit PM - touch it and die instantly.

This is how I eventualy decided to vote. Israel is close up there though.
 
 
Canada, being a neighbour, naturally has far more dealings with the US than all the others combined. Most of it are not earth-shattering but far more important bread-&-butter issues.

As for earth-shattering issues, we all had our disagreements and the US has at times were even hostile to allied intentions. The Suez Crisis comes to mind when the US supported UN military intervention lead by Canada against the UK, France, and Israel.

What history shows that the supporting actions between these countries is really a game of musical chairs. Mitterand and Reagan got along fine. Trudeau couldn't stand Thatcher. And no one had a clue about Jimmy Carter.
 
 
Hey! What the hell?  

Where is my buddy Musharraf the 2 cent lackey figure in this poll????  

Damnit he's the one who dumped the Taliban, flipped Pakistan's entire foreign policy over night, and dropped his pants and bent over in front of that Richard armitage ( Unkal Fester) on Sep 12th 2001! All on a whim!

       

God-damnit I'd like to know where does pakistan figure into being in bed with Unkal Sam!  

If anyone deserves the title of a 2 cent lackey ( close ally), then By God its him!  
 
 
Shut the hell up, troll.

Oh!............. a troll???

What are these personal attacks for ? WHy are they being tolerated?

If he were here to contribute, I'd respond to THAT. Since he's here to spin up other posters, I'll respond to THAT.

His history and style are known, and you'll notice that he didn't want to engage on this subject: he is here throw brickbats, not to answer the question posed by the poll.

I have no intention of respecting someone that is disrespectful, and he proves himself once again to BE disrespectful by attempting to hijack the thread being discussed by rational adults.
 
 
I don't see anything disrespectful in suggesting that Musharraf's Pakistan be included in the list - and I would caution restraint, I don't recall anyone giving you authority to lose your temper and make your own rules.

Personal attacks simply will not suffice, I urge you to reconsider.

Read what he wrote, and tell me that was a rational response to what everybody else had posted before. If he had suggested Pakistan was America's closest ally, you and I wouldn't be having this conversation; that would have been just fine. But he didn't say that, did he?

He's started another ****-storm, which was all he wanted to do when he came in here and crapped all over this thread that was perfectly fine before he arrived.

He LOVES this stuff. I'm just sorry I'm feeding him like this, taking more notice of his worthless self because you called me out on it.

So, unless any further posts actually get back to discussing the OP and what I believe is a fine topic, I'm all done here.

No apologies. He's a contemptible troll and we all know it.
 
 
Well I certainly regret your short fuse and insistence that all opinions be those with which you can relate. Name calling and personal attack deprive your point of view of credibility -- just because other use humour which you do not find worthy is no reason to go off the handle.

Next thing you may want to go on a name calling and personal attack expedition against someone else - please don't do that to yourself.

This is NOT about his opinion. Like I said, if he had said that he believed Musharraf was the US's closest ally, FINE, we'd debate that.

Now I really am done with this. Do you have any opinion on the OP, yourself? Unless you're trolling, I promise that I'll respect your opinion, BECAUSE I'M ALL ABOUT HEARING WHAT OTHERS REALLY HAVE TO SAY.

You follow me, friend? I don't mind if you disagree - most people in this thread HAVE disagreed with me. But only ONE came in here to throw a stink-bomb. And he's the one I loathe.
 
 
For god's sake man, he's trying to be sarcastic.

Actually, yes I do an OP - I think Canada is the most allied ally. UK have their own "imperial" interests which they have sought to protect and further by joining with the Americans - whereas Cananda do not have the same kindof imperial baggage and presence and have been a consistent ally.
 
 
 
Shut the hell up, troll.

 

This is not your call to make, and you only weaken yourself if you do. File the appropriate complaint outlined in the forum rules if you request an action to be taken.

 
Where is my buddy Musharraf the 2 cent lackey figure in this poll????

 

Shaking things up is one thing, but do not go to the point of insulting our intelligence. Prior to 9/11, terrorists were born and bred in Pakistan, and sent to Afghanistan for training and these actions were condoned by your buddy Musharaff. After 9/11, the US gave him an olive branch to clean up his act, and his country. Even though Musharraf made the wise choice, hardly puts him in the running as a close ally under the circumstances. Musharraf has been rewarded for his efforts by the lifting of sanctions, money, and military equipment.

Bluesman has previously defended Pakistan in another post as to their cooperation in fighting terrorism in Pakistan.

With that being said, I think you two are adult enough to continue without the personal name calling, since it is unnecessary, and not a very good example to others here at WAB.

I'm sorry but aren't you overplaying the US angle a bit? My read from both my collegues within the British MoD and the British media is that Blair stands on hiw own when it comes to the Iraq War. MI6, not the CIA, was Blair's primary instrument. Everything would indicate the Britihs public is ready to decide on Blair's poor decision and not because they think Blair is Bush's lap dog.

Even within Canada, sorry to say, but Canadian popular displeasure against BMD is not going to bring the government down. The deciding issue will unfortunately concern something with domestic policy (IE, health care).
 
 
WTF is the Canadians problem with BMD?

Are they stupid or something?

You mean the Average Joe Canada? He's an ignorant blinder wearing guy who naively believe that everybody on earth loves Canada and that soft power is the sole reason why Canada is so well respected on earth.

When confronted with the reality that Canada's position is bought by her military, they shiver into their nice little cubby hole screaming that Canada don't have soldiers, only peacekeepers.

Sad fact is that Canadians don't care about defence matters and no matter how much the NDP and the peace loving fuzzies wuzzies want to charge this up, Canadians don't care enough about BMD to bring down a government.
 
 
I think in military terms, UK is the closest ally as far as supporting the US. Hopefully this won't cost Blair too much. Australia comes second, then Canada.

Economically, Canada comes first, out biggest trading partner and closest neighbor. I would have placed Canada on the top of the list except for her position on Iraq. Other than that, she has stood solidly with the US every time.

I worry about Canada, partly because of what seems to me as a somewhat insane immigration policy. Canada seems to be going more and more to the multi-culturalism model of western europe. I don't want to see the same problems we see cropping up in places like the Netherlands happen to Canada. I think Canada's cultural identity is being watered down, and anti-American sentiment among the youth has a solid hold and is gaining ground.

I really don't trust Israel a bit. Too many times she has onsold US technology to countries that are not friendly to the US. Lavi and AWACS tech to China stands out in my mind. Israel cares only about Israel, and the US is forced to stick up for her because nobody else will. We dump billions of dollars, year after year, to countries like Egypt, just to buy a semi-peace for Israel, and I think Israel needs to put more effort into resolving the conflict in the region.
 
 
Good explanation sir, but someone should inform your citizenry that a nuke strike against any of the bordering US states would cause some pretty nasty fallout problems for canada if the wind happens to be blowing the wrong way that day...
 
 
Canada's stand in NMD doesn't really make sense to me. AFAIK, the only thing we asked Canada for was to agree for NORAD stations to link to National Missile Defence Command. It's not like we need to station interceptors in Canada, or are asking for money. The US would intercept a missile headed to Canada anyway, whether she participated in the program or not.

And if she refused to allow NORAD interoperability in the system, the US would just build another EW network anyway, which would not be good for Canada.

So what's the big deal?

The CF has already signed on as far as the integration of NORAD is concerned. What's at issue for Parliment is the weapons release authority and how far NORAD is into that authority.
 
 
 
... What's at issue for Parliment is the weapons release authority and how far NORAD is into that authority.

 

As in, Canada doesn't want the US to shoot down an incoming missile without first getting their permission?

Same old game the liberals played. The Americans ain't going to take no for an answer, just much like the cruise missile tests over Canadian air space during the Cold War. Even the most dashing, extremely communist Pierre Elliot Trudeau could not refuse the Americans. So, the Liberals allow big massive protests while slipping the tests under the public radar. When it was found out, the Liberals just shrugged their shoulders and said, what's the big deal?

Same kind of thing happenned during the Iraq War. The CF was the 4th largest force contributor to OIF... but you won't find any public acknowledgement.

Thus, the gov't needs to find a way to slip this under the radar.
 
 
 
As in, Canada doesn't want the US to shoot down an incoming missile without first getting their permission?

 

As in how much responsibility NORAD's 2IC, by treaty, a Canadian, has in the weapons release authority.
 
 
Colonel, I confess I do not know very much about how this would play out in a NMD integrated system.

As I understand it right now, the threat assessors in Colorado Springs are Canadian Generals already. So that "phone call" to the US President could very well come from a Canadian anyway. I don't think there is any other country the US would trust with that kind of responsibility. Why should that change, or is it the US that wants to change it?

As you mentioned, the decision of NORAD involvement has already been settled, at least in principle. What kind of responsibilities is Canada looking for wrt weapons release?

Another question, if you don't mind...What would the effect be on the CF if Canada chose not to be more involved in missile defense? It seems to me that the only role left for NORAD if that happened would be traditional air defence, which is not really a major factor in a post cold-war North America. (In the sense that we don't really expect Russian bombers to come flying over the pole)

In recent years, Canada has had a policy of involvement in US led peacekeeping operations internationally. Do you think the Canada would shift away from this and move more toward a EU led role?
 
 
 
Colonel, I confess I do not know very much about how this would play out in a NMD integrated system.

 

It's not the current system that worries the peacenik fuzzies wuzzies. They don't think it would work. It's the weaponization of space that worries them and forcing of Canadian PM to seek assurances that this won't be so.

Those issues are already settled and agreed upon by both militaries and both governments. Generals from both militaries are obligated to destroy any airborne inbound threat to either country with whatever means necessary. Again, it's the weaponization of space that worries Ottawa. Would NORAD take command of such assets and hence, Canadians work towards them?

 
As you mentioned, the decision of NORAD involvement has already been settled, at least in principle. What kind of responsibilities is Canada looking for wrt weapons release?

 

None. Ottawa prefers the old days of the Cold War when NORAD would alert the President but let SAC do the actual weapons release. A case of having your cake and eat it to. Plausible deniability.

 
Another question, if you don't mind...What would the effect be on the CF if Canada chose not to be more involved in missile defense?

(In the sense that we don't really expect Russian bombers to come flying over the pole)

 

We will be involved in BMD. There is no question of that. Just that it would be under the radar. The Chief of Defence Staff General Ray Henault stated as much in that no matter what the Americans decide to do with their part of the NORAD assets, Canada will remain within the treaty.

 
In recent years, Canada has had a policy of involvement in US led peacekeeping operations internationally. Do you think the Canada would shift away from this and move more toward a EU led role?

 

Canada would shift to a EUROCORP if and only if it is lead by the UK. The ABCA program pretty well tied the Americans, British, Canadians, and the Australians (and through the Aussies, the Kiwis) together. The Canucks and Aussies are designing their forces to fit within an American style campaign and with American style technological advantages. The Brits are the only other member who can wage an independent campaign, and extremely limited at that, most likely requiring some sort of American support.

Thanks for the reply Colonel. It pretty much confirms what I thought wrt alliances, etc.

This part is funny though. The "fuzzy wuzzies" aren't opposed to a system as long as they think it won't work. hehe. I guess we'll have to see how it goes as the system matures. I think we'll get there, but the threats and counters will always be improving also.

I think that weaponizing space is inevitable, so I guess Canada can cross that bridge when we come to it. But I'd prefer it was us that took the lead in space rather than China or Russia. Modern warfare is so heavily dependent on space based assets, that denial of space to the enemy would be a major advantage. Too important to ignore, imo. But that's a different debate.

Thanks for your time.

The feeling here is that just get our foot in the door and then tell the fuzzies wuzzies, oops - too late.

Really enjoy reading your posts and butting heads into coming to a common understanding. Incidently, I've asked Col Ken Allen if he could make his rounds with his contacts within the PLAAF to see if there's anything about Project 33. He'll get back to me on that.

I'm going to ask Col Denis Blasko also but I have to dig up his email address somewhere.

To those who do not know these men. Col Ken Allen (USAF ret'd) is THEEE AUTHORITY on the PLAAF. Col Denis Blasko (USArmy ret'd) was the US Defence Attache to Beijing.

I would love to hear what they have to say. I have butted heads with a quite few Pakistanis on the subject also. Some of the BS gets pretty outrageous.  

On an unrelated topic, the rumors about the 2208 boat are running rampant, serial prod, etc. I say uh uh, no evidence of that. A couple fuzzy pics with the numbers taped over is no evidence of serial production. What's your take?

Sad but true. I don't know how many times I've heard fellow Canadians deride the military by stating we own nothing but rubber dingy's and dune buggys with pea s******* and yet whine everytime we contimplate using that army saying we don't even need a military. Quite often I find myself correcting friends after they make assinine statements of a similar nature.

You mean are there more than one? Not to my knowledge nor to CDF's tracking (one of the things we try to do is to see differences in annual budgets and projects announcement). Thus far, we only have comfirmation of one boat and no weapons have ever been seen on it.

With all due modesty, I am a moderator at the best English based Chinese military watcher's forum. The forum DEPENDS on confirmation though we do use rumour as a guide to keep our eyes open.

I am not saying there are more than one. There are rumors about that another one was built, but the evidence is very weak. IOW, some early pics of 2208 with the numbers taped over, and some of the deck hardware not installed. The Chinese kids on some other forums are claiming that they are in serial production, with the second boat coming out of Guangzhou.

I was just curious if you'd heard those rumors. I'm calling them BS, for many reasons, not the least of which is the timeframe. I don't think the PLAN would use two different shipyards and put out two boats in 6 months without even testing out the concept first. Plus, it's a lot easier to build them side by side in the same yard so tooling, jigs, etc. can be used sequentially.

Incidentally, I tried to check out CDF, but you can't browse the forums without an account?
 
 
We concur with your view.

CDF does require you to register. We have had bandwidth problems since last year and registration was one way to keep the bandwidth usage respectable.
 
 
IMO, Canada is the closest ally.
Small example, all the US defence education sites are accessable only by US and Canadian defence personnel, not even British. So if you can trust a nation with defence secrets they they are the closest.
 
 
 
The US has many enemies but she also has many allies. I am curious to know who you all think the US's closest ally is. I don't necessarily means her strongest ally but her most loyal one. All of the choices I have put up as choices are close allies with the US. As for my vote I am not sure. I am torn between England, Canada, and Australia.

 

Sorry if i'm a bit late in answering this. I'm new to the board. Anywho, on to my answer.

At this time, i'd have to say that the United Kingdom is the United States' closest Allie. Australia being a close second and Canada close behind them.

In my humble opinion.

Tibbetts
 
 
1. Australia
2. UK
3. Israel
4. Canada
5. France

In my opinion is Australia the closest US ally. It shares common interests in the region and the world.
 
 
Australia and the UK are great US allies. Canada is more of an ally to the US then Israel has ever been.
 
 
Well the best example of how close an ally Canada is, will be evident when USA is attacked by a country on their own soil. I am not talking religious zealots who are extreme examples of their religion, but by a country which has chosen America as a target. If China ever decided to begin stirring SH*T up on american soil. Canada would be fighting shoulder to shoulder with Americans and Canadians would be willing to DIE for America.

When foreign policy comes back to bite America on the ass, Canada is more than willing to let America fight those battles. Americans may resent that Canada does not support their foreign policies, but they will find that when the crunch is on, that Canada will be their staunchest supporters.
 
 
You're a bit late and a bit off in your assessement. Right now, only extremely stupid countries would dare to attack US soil. The last country with the outright capability was the USSR. The CF has long since been willing to die for the US for the length of the Cold War and even today. Air Command was willing and able to meet and repel the 1st Soviet bomber wave against North America. It's the 2nd, 3rd, 4th waves that we need American help.

The CF has more than demonstrated its value in both Afghanistan and Iraq. 3 PPCLI is an honoury battalion in the 187th Infantry Regiment after Afghanistan and our Naval Task Groups protected CVBG flanks during the Iraq War despite what Ottawa said.

However, what really demonstrated Canadian friendship and I mean friendship and not alliance is how 40,000 Americans found a roof over their heads and a hot meal on 11 Sept.
 
 
Thailand has been a pretty strong US ally. Probaly our most important ally in SE Asia (more so then the Philippines today).

Not bigger in peoples minds then say the UK or Canada but when we needed them most in Indochina they really stepped up and by 1970 were conducting most of the ground fighting in Laos, training Cambodian officers and pilots and had a ground force in Vietnam.

They also sent units to South Korea during that war.

They have/had a rather small force (433) in Iraq.

Seems like they don't get the credit they are due.
 
 
 
You're a bit late and a bit off in your assessement. Right now, only extremely stupid countries would dare to attack US soil.

 

regarding the issue of who will be dominant in the future. Air superiority will only be in the American court till remote fighter planes are mass produced. When a country like China figures out that the limiting factor in air superiority is the human factor, they will more than likely begin to make moves in the direction of flexing military muscle. YES, currently only a stupid nation would attack America on it's own soil, but that power position is not permanent.

The smug attitude of America first is getting tired, and when democratically elected leaders are supplanted by USA in foreign countries to create amicable trade relations, the world reacts and those reactions will be in proportion to american interference.
 
 
 
However, what really demonstrated Canadian friendship and I mean friendship and not alliance is how 40,000 Americans found a roof over their heads and a hot meal on 11 Sept.

 

Damn straight. "Oh yeah, hi there, can we send a crapload of our citizens in planes that might be filled with crazy terrorists into your country?"

Thank you again for saying yes.

And weren't you guys the first ones to invoke Article V of the NATO treaty on 9/11?

You've FAR under-estimated the technological limitations for such a feat. Even the US is not up to that challenge. And the US remains the only country capable of achieving such a feat.

 
Damn straight. "Oh yeah, hi there, can we send a crapload of our citizens in planes that might be filled with crazy terrorists into your country?"

It was not all yes. Originally, the FAA wanted to divert ALL aircrafts out of US airspace, including US domestic flights. Transport Canada (and I believe Mexico also) said no way can 15 airports handle that many flights.

Also, those were the unsung heros of the day. The air traffic controllers who were able to safely land all those planes in so few airports in all 3 countries..

 
And weren't you guys the first ones to invoke Article V of the NATO treaty on 9/11?

 

The one good thing Chretien did though I think more to get help than any sense of honour. Canada did not invoke Art V alone. Chretien did, however, make the suggestion 1st and it snowballed from there.

Well Aristide was one of the more recent controversial occasiaons of interference. In Haiti, Democratically elected leader Aristide was taken from haiti and replaced with a much more corrupt politician with a friendlier attitude toward trade with the US. This is under investigation by CARICOM. The coup was portrayed by media to be an irresistable upsurge of political discontent but it was also a result of long awaited relief funds being witheld and arms smuggling into the rebels and insurgents. The country fell into the hands of the armed the fanatics and the desparately hungry and sick. The US has a fairly significant history of attempting to create an environment for cheap labour in haiti and it is easy to find plenty of evidence on both sides of the argument.

Currently CARICOM has rejected the OAS (organization of American States) proposal with 25 countries rejecting the American interventionist wording in the proposal. The re-wording of the proposal has a VERY specific distinction of removing the power by the US to intervene in internal affairs.

 
The OAS should be an organization promoting democracy, said Venezuelas Foreign Minister Ali Rodriguez on Monday morning, not an organ for intervention in the internal affairs of our countries.
 

and to,

 
give assistance to those countries who solicit it,-
 
 
 
 
You've FAR under-estimated the technological limitations for such a feat.

 

I would have to disagree. Some of the most advanced training equipment for military simulations comes from the CURRENT gaming industry. I feel that the largest limiting factor at this point would be the real-time portrayal of combat environments and the encryption of those signals between planes and pilots on the ground. For example the American f-22 and the british eurofighter...Those planes are both currently fly by wire with the pilot in the cockpit, but it is not a GIANT leap to concieve of that fly-by-wire becoming remotely controlled. If you have contrary information, please explain.

EDIT: I would also add that the current training for pilots involves those same simulations and they are becoming much more effective at creating a realistic environment in the safety of a computer simulation. The gap to be bridged is the translation of the simulation data into real time combat and the Combat data to the simulation environment. In today's world, if a concept can be analyzed and broken down into workable components, the real world applications become limitless.
 
 
 
I would have to disagree.

 

Your knowledge is EXTREMELY limited. At issue is bandwidth and situation awareness. Despite all the advances in technology, there is only so much data that we can transmit and receive and currently and for the foresseable future, we cannot replace the situation awareness that simply demands a pilot.

And those who mastered computer games get chopped fast in real life. I use computers to judge the logistics, nothing more. Computers can never create the shiit happens scenario.
 
 
 
Your knowledge is EXTREMELY limited.

 

Typically unimaginitave military mentality...I bet you are a logistics officer...Look we can both be insulting or we can have a dialogue. I will bring my opinions and ideas and you bring contrary evidence and vice versa but insulting me is only going to show your own ignorance...

Here is evidence of early work on remote fighters from '02...it is in the works...believe it or not. I ain't gonna argue with someone who needs to belittle to make a point.

X-45, DARPA
X-45, Federation of American Scientists
An experimental remote-controlled fighter jet developed by the US military has performed its first test flight.

The flight tested the X-45's flight stability and remote control system. If fully developed, the X-45 would allow fighter pilots to raid enemy targets and engage in airborne combat from the comfort of a base on the ground.
Colonel Michael Leahy, X-45 program manager at the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), says: "Unmanned Combat Air Vehicles (UCAV) will effectively and affordably perform extremely hazardous missions such as the suppression of enemy air defenses while greatly reducing the risk our aircrews have to face."

But unmanned aircraft such as the X-45 would not only make the life of a fighter pilot safer, they would also significantly lower the cost of flying combat missions. On-board pilots require expensive equipment and crewed aircraft spend much of their operational life flying in expensive training exercises.

Cheap shot
An unmanned airplane is cheaper to construct and operators would be largely trained using simulation software. The X-45 could be stored for decades before being used. It is thought each X-45 would cost $15 million, about half that of a typical manned fighter.

A later version of the airplane, called the X-45B, will be designed to carry simulated weapons. The final machine will weigh 3600 kilograms (8000 pounds) and carry 1400 kg (3000 lb) of weaponry. Further flight tests are planned for throughout 2002, including tests involving other aircraft.

Other unmanned fighter planes are in development and smaller remote-controlled military planes have already been fully developed. Slow-flying Predator spy planes fitted with limited weaponry have been used in Afghanistan recently.

The X-45 is 8.2m (27 feet) long, smaller than a typical manned fighter plane and has no tail fin. Its engine is situated where the pilot would sit. During its maiden flight, the X-45 reached an altitude of 2286 metres (7500 feet) and a maximum air speed of 361 km/h (195 knots). The airplane has been developed by DARPA, Boeing and the US Air Force.

So in reading the above statement, HOW is my knowledge 'EXTREMELY' limited?
 
 
Also it seems that by your standards, DARPA, Boeing and the US Air Force also have extremely limited knowledge too. Being that they are pursuing this technology...  
 
 
Still limited. None of this address what I've already stated. That the situation awareness problem has yet to be overcome. If you think you're insulted - too bad. I've been with the CF for over 20 years (regforce, CFR, and civie contractor) and if you can't face criticism, then don't post with military personnel present.

My counter? Extremely easy. Tarnak Farm.

And my title explains my job and I retired with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel.

And it's already deployed in the PREDATOR. We have a person in SOCOM who is using that tool right now but it is NOT an air superiority system, let alone an air dominance one. You lack the understanding of the roles these technology play.

It will not replace the pilot anytime soon.

So your attitude is that because we don't have the technology TODAY it isn't a factor? Hmmm, Boeing, DARPA, and USAF working on the problems of HOW to overcome the limiting factors of remote fighter technology is insignificant to you? I am the one with 'Limited' knowledge? LOL whatever man, you feel free to express yourself in whatever manner you like. I know NOW to not take your comments seriously. Thank you for enlightening me.
 
 
Not that I believe you will give this any creedence but here is current remote technology being tested on the f-16 as well as QF-4 remotely operated drone phantoms.

 
FSAT system technology can be easily adapted to a wide range of aircraft interfaces. The digital bus architecture of the F-16 minimises complex and troublesome interfaces seen on older aircraft converted into FSAT drones. The F-16 aircraft design also provides the kinematics, signature, offensive/defensive capabilities, maintainability and flight-control redundancy characteristics to ensure support for any future programme from all critical assessment perspectives.
To equip an aircraft for remote operation requires a system architecture and design that allows remote operation and monitoring of all mission-essential subsystems during all mission phases. Existing aircraft functions that must be operated/monitored include as a minimum flight-control and stability augmentation systems; engine-control and monitoring aircraft auxiliary systems; payload and aircraft systems. Remote control of these systems is facilitated by a sophisticated automatic flight control computer (AFCC) and command/ telemetry system that ties into existing aircraft bus structure and works with existing systems rather than replacing functions. The CTS provides the data link to the ground-control station and down/up link message encoding/decoding function. For tactical capability a jamming-proof satellite system can be used. The AFCC provides the airborne command and control processing and interface to each subsystem and on-board automated functions to minimise the workload of the ground station controller. Many of these automated functions are used in FSAT operations and can be adapted for additional tactical roles.

So my point is that we are WORKING on it. It may not be here today but you can bet your cute brass buttons that it will be here soon.
 
 
This last part of this thread needs a new thread entitled military technology. It doesn't directly apply to the topic, and needs to be moved.
 
 
Fine. Believe all you want. However, NONE of what you posted demonstrated in any way that the Chinese or anyone for that matter is going to overtake the US. And it clearly showed that the US is years if not decades ahead of each other.

As for your belief in these systems, there are enough threads on this board to point out the fallacy and bottomless money pits these things are.

Everything you have posted is mere brochure. No real system has been developed nor is it going to be developed anytime soon.

You remains extremely limited in knowledge about these systems.
 
 
OK thanks man.  
 
 
In an attempt to steer the good ship back on course...

It is interesting to consider the opinions expressed earlier in this thread about the Anglosphere. I can say with some authority (being British) that most British people do not dislike America and most people consider the Trans-Atlantic Alliance very important.

I think the term 'resentment' is far too strong, but certainly there is a feeling that Britain doesn't benefit a great deal from its alliance with America at the moment. Now that isn't intended as a flame, merely as an observation of current popular attitudes. It is possible, perhaps even probable, that public opinion will shift away from this view in the years to come.
 
 
I remember alot of frustrations when we tossed out all the work UNPROFOR has done but viewed it as necessary to get the Americans on board.
 
 
@Officer of Engineers

I think part of the problem really lies in the fact that whilst Britain is still not a very pro-EU country, there is mixed attitudes there. There seems to be a great deal of ambivalence at the moment over Europe and America, and which path Britain should be taking.
 
 
Well, Australia has deployed along with the US and allies at every major (and a few minor) war since ww2. Were were there in Korea, Vietnam, Gulf 1 & 2, Afghanistan, we regularly train with you guys, let you have bases on our territory, and both sides of politics (at the moment at least) strongly support the US Australia alliance.

We are a small nation with an entire continent to defend in a potentially hostile region, so it's kinda remarkable that we can let anyone go. Heh, not to mention our recent purchase of M1-A1's. We can't move them offshore at all. AFAIK, we train our troopers in them over here, them use Yank tanks in deployments overseas.

Nice to have them guarding the homeland though, I'm sure.  
 
 
In terms of pure military contributions to anything America might do, probably the UK. A country of 60 million will obviously be able to contribute more forces to a conflict, or several conflicts, than a country of 32 million (Canada) 20-ish million (Australia) and I imagine Israel, with 7-8 million, has very little manpower to spare, having been hemmed in for the past fifty years by its aggressive neighbours and general situation.

In terms of popular and cultural opinions and attitudes to the United States, it's much hazier. Australian popular support for the Iraq War has been stronger than British support, for example, and Israel is heavily and quite contentiously aided by America. Canada also provides a greater market for American goods, and provides the American economy with relatively risk-free natural resources (as opposed to buying from the Middle East). It's hard to say, but you can count on all of them in any hypothetical war for American (and by extension Western) survival, and they will contribute what they can.
 
 
@HistoricalDavid

I would largely agree with that summation, but would eqnuire as to the issue of markets for the U.S. Whilst it is probably easier for American companies to operate in and sell goods in Canada, the UK would be a more important market in terms of both market size and goods sought.

The UK would not only be a potentially bigger market for American consumer goods, but also for American military goods and services.

The UK does have aunique situation when compared with the other countries mentioned though (except France) in that it also has close ties with another power bloc in the shape of the EU. British loyalties are therefore somewhat torn.

Whilst America could certainly count upon British support in a crisis such as you mentioned, one wonders at British support in a situation such as possible military action against Iran. Neither Blair nor any other current politician with a chance of becoming Prime Minister could realistically offer miliatry support to such a venture without massive protests and the possible collapse of his/her government. In addition the armed forces themselves would no doubt raise strong objections due to the severe strain already placed upon the British military.

Military action against North Korea would be less likely to draw such protest and it would be more likely that Britain could offer support in such a conflict. Again though, top brass in the military would liekly voice concerns over what support could be provided owing to the commitments Britain already has.

With the current situation in the world and assuming britain intended to hold to her commitments elsewhere I don;t se ehow there could be any sort of meaningful commitment to a major military venture without conscription, at least of a limited nature.
 
 
Britain has in the last century been our greatest ally.
 
 
In terms of historic military committements, Britain's larger population than Canada and Australia was not a factor in fielding larger forces since the end of WWII. All 3 historically contributed about the same size of forces (brigade).
 
 
Bluesman has made some good points. Australia also stands to become a much larger trading partner in the near future.
 
 
 
Britain has in the last century been our greatest ally.

 

Well, how about turning this around.

Without a doubt, the US has been OUR (take your pick of any of the ABCA countries) greatest ally.
 
 
And if by our you mean Britain's, you are correct.

Funny,

You guys complain that France forgets and is ungrateful for what you did to France during WWII.

But I don't see anybody being remembering or being grateful to France for what it did during the Revolutionary War.

Without Napoleon and its navy battling against the British preventing more reinforcements, the Revolution would have gone the other way. As you guys so often like to say, the French would be speaking German, you guys would still be listening to bagpipes and calling the government and the citizens as Her Majesty's Government or Her Majesty's subjects.  

Just calling the pot kettle black. (is that a proper phrase?).

I hasten to point out that France was simply using the revolutionary colonists as another stick to poke in the eye of Great Britain.
Louis was sure as hell no fan of the democratic principles behind the revolution.

Granted that the French weren't helping the colonists because they supported democratic ideals, but support them they did. French support was instrumental in helping to achieve a victory by the colonists.

That is not in dispute.
However, American rebels were not an established sovereign country that had been overrun by an egomaniac jealous of his relatives realms, nor a genocidal madman.
I'll admit that the motives of the French in 1776 and the Americans in 1918 and 1944 were basically the same at their core, but there was a wee bit of difference.
 
 
@TopHatter

I don't disagree with you. Since the end of the Plantagenet Empire England's, and later Britain's, role in Europe has basically been to prevent French domination.

Agreed.

And hey, let's face it: France has never been one to show gratitude to anybody.
France does what France wants. It can be a good thing sometimes, since they won't let the same public and world opinion factors stop them from taking care of business like the United States does when it comes to a little wet work.
 
 
 
I'm sorry but aren't you overplaying the US angle a bit? My read from both my collegues within the British MoD and the British media is that Blair stands on hiw own when it comes to the Iraq War. MI6, not the CIA, was Blair's primary instrument. Everything would indicate the Britihs public is ready to decide on Blair's poor decision and not because they think Blair is Bush's lap dog.

Even within Canada, sorry to say, but Canadian popular displeasure against BMD is not going to bring the government down. The deciding issue will unfortunately concern something with domestic policy (IE, health care).

Well to be fair to France they look out for their national interests first and foremost and credit to their leaders where it is due, they try their hardest to get the best deal for France. As much as I don't necessarily agree with how they go about it I can understand where they come from.

The, perhaps ironic, thing is that France, at a fundamental level, really does not care about anything other than Europe. What one must understand is that most Europeans have a very Euro-centric perspective when it comes to power politics. The vast colonial empires were largely acquired to get one over on one's European opponents. Britain's empire can be said to have been an 'accidental empire' in some regards in that much of it was acquired to prevent France from acquiring or controling those areas.

To continue with the French example, France doesn;t really view the U.S. as being an 'opponent' to its national interests. It may very oppose the U.S. on various matters and such like, but France is more concerned with Britain, Germany, Italy and the rest of the EU. I could almost guarantee you that if America where to invade Iran at the same time as there was proposed reform of the CAP, the French cabinet would be huddled together discussing how they could best deal with the CAP issue.

This is very much true of all European politicians, they measure world events by how they will impact Europe. When one examines European nations through this 'lens' one can gain a better understanding of why it is that they do certain things.

Too true, they did indeed and they brought those democratic principles back to France. Unfortunately, it touched off the French Revolution which did exactly like the American Revolution.
They were also sent by the order of their Sovereign without a lot of choice in the matter.
While there was obviously a draft in America and American troops were also ordered in by their CINC, they went willingly and supportive of the war and it's aims.

I would not for one second denigrate the French contribution to the Revolutionary War, but I will point out French policies towards the new nation immediately afterwards (yes, new management was in charge) and lack of solid French gratitude towards the rest of the Western Allies (not just the United States) after World War I and II.
 
 
Why isn't Pakistan in the pole? Bush himself stated that it is one of our closest allies.
 
 
 
Australia is VERY good as an ally, because although they don't bring a lot of physical strength to the table, philosophically they're true-blue and loyal.

Howard was just returned as Australian Prime Minister, and he is very closely identified with Dubya.

Contrast that with Tony Blair, who, although a strong and loyal ally, has to fight the 'Bush's Poodle' slander, and in so doing has sometimes had to distance himself and show his independence of the US for doemstic political considerations.

So the Brits are sacrificing and actually doing the heavy lifting in the War on Terror right alongside of us - but the grumble and ***** the whole way. Aussies aren't making as much of a contribution, but I have a sense they don't resent what they are doing, and wouldn't mind all that much if they were asked to do even more.

 

Reviving this one, because Mark Steyn backed up with a column what I had said waaaaay back thar:

 
Don't deny that some Muslims are hot for jihad

April 2, 2006

BY MARK STEYN SUN-TIMES COLUMNIST

If I were an anti-war leftie, I'd be very depressed by the Iraq anniversary protests. A few hundred people show up hither and yon to see Cindy Sheehan get arrested for the 15th time that week, or Charlie Sheen unveil his critically acclaimed the-World-Trade-Center-was-a-controlled-explosion conspiracy theory. The "Hot Shots! Part Deux" star is apparently an expert in that field, and he'd never seen commercial property break up that quickly since Heidi Fleiss' hooker ring. Anyway, Susan Sarandon's going to play Cindy in the movie, or maybe she's playing Charlie, or both -- either way, they might as well give her the Oscar during the opening titles.

But, while Charlie Sheen is undoubtedly a valiant leader, you couldn't help noticing it was followers the anti-war crowd seemed to be short of on the third anniversary. The next weekend half a million illegal immigrants -- whoops, sorry, half a million fine upstanding members of the Undocumented-American community-- took to the streets, and you suddenly realized what a big-time demonstration is supposed to look like. These guys aren't even meant to be in the country and they can organize a better public protest movement than an anti-war crowd that's promoted 24/7 by the media and Hollywood.

Well, OK, half the anti-war crowd aren't meant to be in the country either, if they'd kept their promise to move to Canada after the last election. But my point is there's no mass anti-war movement. Some commentators claimed to be puzzled by the low turnout at a time when the polls show Iraq increasingly unpopular. But there are two kinds of persons objecting to the war: There's a shriveled Sheehan-Sheen left that's in effect urging on American failure in Iraq, and there's a potentially far larger group to their right that's increasingly wary of the official conception of the war. The latter don't want America to lose, they want to win -- decisively. And on the day's headlines -- on everything from the Danish cartoon jihad to the Afghan facing death for apostasy -- the fainthearted response of "public diplomacy" is in danger of sounding only marginally less nutty than Charlie Sheen.

The line here is "respect." Everybody's busy professing their "respect": We all "respect" Islam; presidents and prime ministers and foreign ministers, lapsing so routinely into the deep-respect-for-the-religion-of-peace routine they forget that cumulatively it begins to sound less like "Let's roll!" and too often like "Let's roll over!"

Jack Straw, the British foreign secretary, gave a typical Western government official's speech the other day explaining that "a large number of Muslims in this country were -- understandably -- upset by those cartoons being reprinted across Europe and at their deeply held beliefs being insulted. They expressed their hurt and outrage but did so in a way which epitomized the learned, peaceful religion of Islam."

"The learned, peaceful religion of Islam"? And that would be the guys marching through London with placards reading "BEHEAD THE ENEMIES OF ISLAM" and "FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION IS WESTERN TERRORISM" and promising to rain down a new Holocaust on Europe? This is geopolitics as the Aretha Franklin Doctrine: The more the world professes its R-E-S-P-E-C-T, the more the Islamists sock it to us.

At a basic level the foreign secretary's rhetoric does not match reality. Government leaders are essentially telling their citizens: Who ya gonna believe -- my platitudinous speechwriters or your lyin' eyes?

To win a war, you don't spin a war. Millions of ordinary citizens are not going to stick with a "long war" (as the administration now calls it) if they feel they're being dissembled to about its nature. One reason we regard Churchill as a great man is that his speeches about the nature of the enemy don't require unspinning or detriangulating.

If I had to propose a model for Western rhetoric, it would be the Australians. In the days after Sept. 11, the French got all the attention for that Le Monde headline -- "Nous sommes tous Americains" -- "We are all Americans," though they didn't mean it, even then. But John Howard, the Aussie prime minister, put it better and kept his word: "This is no time to be an 80 percent ally."

Marvelous. More recently, the prime minister offered some thoughts on the difference between Muslims and other immigrant groups. "You can't find any equivalent in Italian or Greek or Lebanese or Chinese or Baltic immigration to Australia. There is no equivalent of raving on about jihad," he said, stating the obvious in a way most political leaders can't quite bring themselves to do. "There is really not much point in pretending it doesn't exist."

Unfortunately, too many of his counterparts insist on pretending (at least to their citizenry) that it doesn't exist. What proportion of Western Muslims is hot for jihad? Five percent? Ten, 12 percent? Given that understanding this Pan-Islamist identity is critical to defeating it, why can't we acknowledge it honestly? "Raving on about jihad" is a line that meets what the law used to regard as the reasonable-man test: If you're watching news footage of a Muslim march promising to bring on the new Holocaust, John Howard's line fits.

Is it something in the water down there? Listen to Howard's Cabinet colleagues. Here's the Australian treasurer, Peter Costello, with advice for Western Muslims who want to live under Islamic law: "There are countries that apply religious or sharia law -- Saudi Arabia and Iran come to mind. If a person wants to live under sharia law these are countries where they might feel at ease. But not Australia."

You don't say. Which is the point: Most Western government leaders don't say, and their silence is correctly read by a resurgent Islam as timidity. I also appreciated this pithy summation by my favorite foreigner minister, Alexander Downer: "Multilateralism is a synonym for an ineffective and unfocused policy involving internationalism of the lowest common denominator." See Sudanese slaughter, Iranian nukes, the U.N.'s flop response to the tsunami, etc. It's a good thing being an Aussie Cabinet minister doesn't require confirmation by John Kerry and Joe Biden.

My worry is that the official platitudes in this new war are the equivalent of the Cold War chit-chat in its 1970s detente phase --when Willy Brandt and Pierre Trudeau and Jimmy Carter pretended the enemy was not what it was. Then came Ronald Reagan: It wasn't just the evil-empire stuff, his jokes were on the money, too. In their own depraved way, the Islamists are a lot goofier than the commies and a few gags wouldn't come amiss. If this is a "long war," it needs a rhetoric that can go the distance. And the present line fails that test.

Nice article by Mark Steyn as usual, Bluesman.

That said, one wonders whether Australia as a US ally might be facing certain strategic dilemmas in the future:-

such as balancing advantages with the PRC and its further involvement in the Asia-Pacific (ie. signing the TAC with ASEAN and its participation in the inaugural East Asian Summit);

while at the same time still maintaining the strategic relationship with the US and the attendant advantages?
 
 
Our closest allies continue to be the members of the Anglo sphere, i.e. United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada.

By the way, I don't see a choice for our Enternal Friend, the Saudis on the list.
 
 
The offical term is ABCA (American, British, Canadian, Australian).
 
 
Thank you. That's the term I can't remember.

How about New Zealand? I thought they have a fairly close tie to the ABCA structure. Although they don't have much of a military to speak of...  
 
 
NZ is considered an Australian Auxillary.

LOL, in the context of ABCA he's quite right Ray. After all ABCANZ doesn't have quite the right ring, does it?  
 
 
If you pronounce it as Abcans it can work  
 
 
 
Fine but remember that French people died fighting for the Americans regardless of their reasons, personal or political.

 

Motive matters very much.. for it is one motives that will define what one can expect in the future.

Closest ally.. U.K., BEST ally.. Australia, Always willing to heft a coldie to our mates down under..
 
 
 
Ballastic Missile Defence. Canada chickened out.

 

Yeah maybe cause it hasn't even proven to be 100% effective. More like a 20% chance of hitting a target. Or the multiple scientists who are saying it's worthless. But hey Science vs. Government and Military who's usually right...
Seems like a pretty shitty investment for a country with the population of California. Gee yeah lets buy a product that doesn't work sounds great. Maybe when it does work it'll be a no brainer. Also keep in mind that Cdn work on Norad is still there to benefit the missle defense system not like anything is missing there.

Well anyways A lot of this is pretty funny reading we might not agree up here with a lot of right wing views but we have that right. Then again Canadians know a million times more about Americans than anyone has a clue about Canadians. Believe me I went to the US for highschool and I had the highest American history grade in my class as sad as that is. A lot of what your saying sounds like it's straight off Fox news which is scary. Fox news on Canada is generally pretty funny I must say, then again anything fox news says is pretty funny "Terrorism is a bigger threat than global warming or pollution" lol yeah wonder who pays the bills there. I don't know a single Canadian who wouldn't run to the aid of a US citizen if they needed help or defense. We don't have the superiority complex up here politically we can act like it maybe cause we are so intouch with your news that we have an outside voice but tell me when Cdns haven't helped out the US? I know what your thinking but yes there are some special units in Iraq.
One of the biggest issues is maybe the fact that we are sick of US politicians butting in with our own which shouldn't happen IE: Bush US citizens living in Canada should vote for so and so like gimme a break. People in the US have their own problems being overlooked every single day healthcare, social security, political corruption etc etc and yet the US finds time to stick it's head in where it doesn't belong. Nothing new there.
Keep in mind we still build American weapons and vehicles here so all this oooh Canada now hates us bs is just stupid, maybe come up here and find out for yourself. Well other than Quebec since they seem to hate the majority of Canadians too.

P.S. **** the french
 
 
 
Yeah maybe cause it hasn't even proven to be 100% effective.

 

What is 100% effective? Anything?

 
Seems like a pretty shitty investment for a country with the population of California.

 

IIRC, it was a no charge item...
 
 
And the rest of the post was the typical pseudo-patriotic idiocy shown by many Canadians who simultaneously think they are better than Americans but consider the Americans to be the ones with the superiority complex.

You're an idiot and a liar. There was no investment. The US was just asking for a signature. The US was not asking for more money; no research; no people; no territory and offerring a dual release to Ottawa. But no, let's just lie big time that this is as way too expensive for Canada. You're deep in the hogwash.

 
Well anyways A lot of this is pretty funny reading we might not agree up here with a lot of right wing views but we have that right. Then again Canadians know a million times more about Americans than anyone has a clue about Canadians.

 

And the rest of the world knows alot more about Americans than Canadians.

Fox news on Canada is generally pretty funny I must say, then again anything fox news says is pretty funny "Terrorism is a bigger threat than global warming or pollution" lol yeah

 

Newsflash you idiot, Canadians died on 11 September, the Earth is cooler than it was 50 years ago, and per capita Canada put more pollution into the air than the US.

 
wonder who pays the bills there.

 

The advertisers, stupid turd. You went to high school in the US, right? Well, you're insulting their education system and embarrassing my country.

Not anymore.

 
One of the biggest issues is maybe the fact that we are sick of US politicians butting in with our own which shouldn't happen IE: Bush US citizens living in Canada should vote for so and so like gimme a break.

 

So you want Canada to stop US politicians from lobbying US citizens for their votes in US elections? In other words, you want Canada to have the right to tell US citizens how not to vote.

 
People in the US have their own problems being overlooked every single day healthcare, social security, political corruption etc etc and yet the US finds time to stick it's head in where it doesn't belong.

 

What the hell do you think you're doing?

 
Keep in mind we still build American weapons and vehicles here so all this oooh Canada now hates us bs is just stupid, maybe come up here and find out for yourself. Well other than Quebec since they seem to hate the majority of Canadians too.

What the hell are the Americans supposed to think when you have two Cabinet Ministers spouting anti-American slogans; stomping a George Bush Jr Doll on national TV and two Prime Ministers who wink, wink, nudge, nudge such actions? You're damned right the Americans would be pissedoff.

Let's not be too hasty here.

He's not an insult to our education system. Our education system really is that bad. Our high school is more interested in indoctrinate our young with left wing ideology and anti-Americanism than teaching kids how to read and write.

I'd say he's a good representation of our failed public education system.

Global warming? HA! Even the global warming cult is changing their name to "climate change" cult.  

Global warming is a concoction of pseudo scientists desperate for research grants because they can't find a real job in the real world.

We no longer have a battle group in Yugoslavia. Instead, there's a combat brigade (2000+ troops) under American command in Afghanistan and have been seeing alot of action lately.

It is rather nice that in every response you found a way to not carry on a valid debate or conversation buy you resorted to name calling. Nice Nice no wonder the US is so amazing at winning over the hearts of the world bunch of assholes like you can't even carry on a conversation. /
================================================== =======
Vietnam; You realize you lost this right? Hope you know that first off. "Canada played both sides of the fence: On one hand, it actively supported the war by exporting materiel, spying for the Americans while on the ICC, and trying to play a mediator role to help reach a conclusion that could allow the U.S. to honourably leave the conflict" etc etc  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_and_the_Vietnam_War 
Some people from Canada did go join the military in the US too I hope you know.

Grenada; An island nation no bigger than Martha's Vineyard. US Navy couldn't handle it you need Canada and surrounding neighbors to help?

post-Korean; You always need countries to keep things running in wars you don't finish or what you weren't exactly fighting anywhere else for the next while.

War Korea; Participation of Canadian forces in the UN Operations in Korea from 1950 to 1953

post-Kuwait- War Iraq; Haha well we participated in the war and one of the first nations to back it. first time since the Korean War that Canadian forces had participated in offensive combat operations. Some of our vets have gulf war syndtome too. But you say post Iraq war? LOL what the hell did the US do for Iraq post war? protected the kurds but went right back in to do bombings once then invaded it next.

Beirut Bombing Lebenon; Ummm What do you want from Canada on this one? Go send home the dead troops for you guys or what? Horrible thing that happened but I dunno why the truck wasn't stopped or how Canada should have anything to do with this one.

Tanker War; Iran Iraq war? What do u want Canada to do help the US transport chemical weapons to Iraq? Or what?

North Korea atomic crisis; "China has also allowed North Korea to ship SCUD missiles through its territory for Middle Eastern customers. According to a Canadian undercover operative, North Korean agents moved dismantled SCUD missiles through China into Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran." You don't just think Canada sits by do you?

China-US EP-3 Incident; You wanted us to do what?

Liberia; Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Peter MacKay issued a statement Thursday that supported Taylor's arrest and trial of war-crimes charges. No troops just political

Sierra Leonne; What did the US do? I'm not even familiar with this.

Cdns did also recently go to Haiti to deal with that mess too.

BTW Cdn rescue workers were also getting to Katrina survivors than some American rescue organizations
"The suburb of 68,000 people was initially ignored by U.S. authorities who were scrambling to get aid to New Orleans. Boasso said floodwater in his parish is still 2.4 metres deep in some places."
Boasso saved his praise for the Canadians and their quick work. "They were so glad to be here," he said. "They're still here. They are actually going door-to-door looking in the attics" for people to rescue." Where were you troops? or Fema? They were down there before a lot of US agencies were.

Do you believe in dinosaurs? How long did it take for them to become extinct? Paleontologists said they extincted within a "geologic blink of an eye." It is believed that a giant asteroid hit the earth roughly 65 million years ago and the dinosaurs died out within the next few hundred thousand years, a "geologic blink of an eye" if you will.

Here we are, with the global warming cultists trying to tell us the earth is warming up based on the data they collected for the last 30 years. How long is 30 years? Is it a long enough time span for us to get a clear picture of a planet that's believed to be nearly 4 billion years old? Sharks haven't changed for around 60 million years. Grass appeared around 30 million years ago. There were no tropical rain forest until 25 million years ago. Horses were the size of house dogs 3 million years ago. Modern man appeared 1.5 million years ago. We moved out of Africa maybe a few hundred thousand years ago, a "geologic blink of an eye" if you will.

Earth has been warming up for the past 30 years. Oh no. We are all doomed. Because we measured the earth for 30 years therefore we can extrapolate the health of a planet that's 4 billion years old. We are so intelligent.  

You know, this morning I woke up at 8 and it was 60F outside. The temperature rose to 80F by 10AM. It's 100F at noon. Therefore I project the air temperature will hit 140F by 4PM, 180F by 8PM, and by midnight, 220F.

By the way, have you tracked down the manbearpig yet?
 
 
I just served the appetizer.  
 
 
 
LOL yeah you keep thinking that. Polluted water and and air isn't going to kill anyone cause corporate America keeps America clean right?  

 

I can't believe you're that dumb. The point, jackass is that we're polluting far more than the Americans.

 
Lets Oh wait Amount of pollution related deaths millions > Terrorist Attacks well until 911 barely making a dent.

 

How many Canadians died of pollution last year? Last decade? Care to provide the stats?

 
It's pretty crazzy living in the northern hemisphere and each year theres less and less snow dramatically it's great when people the South go on about how theres no change in weather cause ya know all that snow they get anually. But hey Fox News and Jesus will protect you from it all right?

 

So, you do swallow.

 
 Nat' Academies Press, Natural Climate Variability on Decade-to-Century Time Scales 
 
FIGURE 5

Annual snowfall over North America during the last 40 years. The applied scale-correction factors for network elevation are: for Alaska1.23; for Canada, Zone 55-70°N1.14, Zone 45-55°N1.19, and Zone 35-45°N1.47.
 

The data says you are 100% wrong. So, either you pulled this crap out of your butt or you swallow the come-on of the global warming crowd.

 
Where exactly are you getting this Canada wouldn't have to spend anything on the missle defense system?

Cry me a river. The world ain't a nice place. And I am a Canadian and you are an embarrassement to my country. If you can't handle it, go to baby school. This forum ain't for wimps and it certainly ain't for those who don't have convictions.

Thankfully, at least 2000+ Canadians don't agree with you one bit with what you call help.

 
Vietnam; You realize you lost this right? Hope you know that first off. "Canada played both sides of the fence: On one hand, it actively supported the war by exporting materiel, spying for the Americans while on the ICC, and trying to play a mediator role to help reach a conclusion that could allow the U.S. to honourably leave the conflict" etc etc

 

What a load of horse crock! The very fact it was the ICC should tell you exactly what kind of help Canada could have given the US. The ICC was made up of three countries; none of which were official allies of Hanoi nor of the VC. That means 3 different armies were watching Hanoi. More over, since the ICC is supposedly a neutral observing body, ALL its findings are to be reported to the world body.

All this means the ICC saw only what Hanoi allowed the ICC to see. Good source? Hardly. The CF Officers in the ICC did extremely good work and that work is of some value but in the overall scheme of things, the Americans could have lived and prospered without it. At best, Washington got a heads up on what the ICC was going to tell the world... and that was the way Ottawa wanted it.

 
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_and_the_Vietnam_War 
Some people from Canada did go join the military in the US too I hope you know.

 

And those Canadians served a foreign flag and wore a foreign uniform; has nothing to do with Canada.

 
Grenada; An island nation no bigger than Martha's Vineyard. US Navy couldn't handle it you need Canada and surrounding neighbors to help?

 

Canada should not help then? Gee, that's a nice excuse. You Americans can do all the work and we'll just sit back and enjoy the results of a newly free and democractic country in the region.

 
post-Korean; You always need countries to keep things running in wars you don't finish or what you weren't exactly fighting anywhere else for the next while.

 

We didn't finish, dumbass... and we left the South Koreans and the Americans holding the bag.

 
War Korea; Participation of Canadian forces in the UN Operations in Korea from 1950 to 1953

 

You could not even google right. First Canadian action was on 22 April, 1951 at the Battle of Kapyong by my battle group.

 
post-Kuwait- War Iraq; Haha well we participated in the war and one of the first nations to back it. first time since the Korean War that Canadian forces had participated in offensive combat operations.

 

This ain't even a nice try and it goes to show how damned little you know. The Canadian Forces had extensive combat engagements in Cyperus; the Congo; and Lebanon before the Kuwait War.

 
Some of our vets have gulf war syndtome too. But you say post Iraq war? LOL what the hell did the US do for Iraq post war? protected the kurds but went right back in to do bombings once then invaded it next.

 

I said post-Kuwait War, idiot or can't you read? And the war wasn't finished. The Air War lasted another 11 years before the final invasion. We again let the Americans to finish what we began.

 
Beirut Bombing Lebenon; Ummm What do you want from Canada on this one? Go send home the dead troops for you guys or what? Horrible thing that happened but I dunno why the truck wasn't stopped or how Canada should have anything to do with this one.

 

We had a field hospital at CFB Lahrs, Germany. 12 hours flight time.

 
Tanker War; Iran Iraq war? What do u want Canada to do help the US transport chemical weapons to Iraq? Or what?

 

If you don't what the Tanker War was, then you can't answer correctly, can you? A Flag.

 
North Korea atomic crisis; "China has also allowed North Korea to ship SCUD missiles through its territory for Middle Eastern customers. According to a Canadian undercover operative, North Korean agents moved dismantled SCUD missiles through China into Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran." You don't just think Canada sits by do you?

 

1) Wrong piece of intel
2) It's the NO-DONG, not SCUD
3) Not one thing you've posted got anything to do with nukes.

 
China-US EP-3 Incident; You wanted us to do what?

 

The Australians sent a naval task group through that area.

 
Liberia; Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Peter MacKay issued a statement Thursday that supported Taylor's arrest and trial of war-crimes charges. No troops just political

 

The world is full of statements; doesn't help the dead and dying any. And the American intervention stopped the killings; just by showing up.

 
Sierra Leonne; What did the US do? I'm not even familiar with this.

Cdns did also recently go to Haiti to deal with that mess too.

 

Google them for your answers. You were the one who said that we were at the American side each and everytime they needed us. It's damned obvious that we were not and certainly even your revisionism ain't going to change those facts.

 
BTW Cdn rescue workers were also getting to Katrina survivors than some American rescue organizations
"The suburb of 68,000 people was initially ignored by U.S. authorities who were scrambling to get aid to New Orleans. Boasso said floodwater in his parish is still 2.4 metres deep in some places."

And the USAF flew 1 Brigade from Edmonton to Eastern Ontario/Western Quebec during Ice Storm 98.

So, what's your point here? The Americans are so bad that we Canadians are so superior that we're allowed to piss them off? Get off the moose. We weren't there each and everytime the Americans needed us. Sometimes, it's because we couldn't do it. Other times, it's because we don't want to do it. That's history. There's no changing it. It doesn't make us worst than the Americans but it damned does not make us better.

Last thing, I served with the Canadian Forces.
 
 
Why thank you Colonel, always a pleasure to read your posts.

It is believed that a giant asteroid hit the earth roughly 65 million years ago and the dinosaurs died out within the next few hundred thousand years, a "geologic blink of an eye" if you will.

 

Actually there has never been much solid evidence to link the K-T mass extinction event with an impact event. One of those neat and sexy theories that grabbed the public and academic eye for a while but has never panned out when subjected to serious scrutiny.

But certainly a paltry 100,000 years is barely noticeable in geologic time, you are right about that.

7 pages of posts and lets see how much did the topic deviate from our original discussion  

UK, CANANA, AUSTRALIA, ISRAEL, JAPAN, by this order

ISRAEL AND JAPAN are NOT the closest allies, just look at how those two countries are excluded from Intel Sharing and Joint system development
 
 
Come on this is easy! Canada is closer to the US, for cryin' out loud! It's bumped right up against us! The Britian is way over across that big ocean-thingy, and Australia? I couldn't even FIND it in Europe! (That's the only place that really matters, right?) Did you mean Austria? Geez, you all are Lousy spelllers! BTW, I ran into a girl who said she was from Brittany, but I think she was full of crap, 'cause she sounded french, and I thought everybody in Britian spoke english, sorta.
 
 
Made me laugh, and I've got a wicked headache.

Funny.  
 
 
 
I didn't want to get into a fracas.

Israel is the actual friend of the US.

Without Israel, the US would have no influence in the ME; and not only the Israeli govt but also the Israeli population has always stood solidly behind the US.

Now tell me which other country has done so - solidly, that is!

 

Israel is the greatest negative influence for the US in terms of the Middle East. We can't be a neutral force in Arab-Israeli conflict due to the fact we give them so much money. This is also the only reason they stand behind us, its because without us they feel that they would not be able to survive.

A true ally will stand by you when you are just and not stand by you when you are unjust, a true friend will be by your side even if its not in their own best interest. That is why the UK is a good ally.

You're attempting to apply the personal relationship model to international relations. It's a weak analogy at best. It's used often to allow the masses (who haven't a clue about such things) to "get a handle" on what's happening in the world. It breaks down quite badly as soon as you try to extropolate from the model to the actual relationship, rather than the other way 'round. No nation has "Friends" only mutual interests. Cultural ties count for something, but it is most certainly not a primary factor (IMHO). Also "Just" xs "Unjust" varies with culture and POV. Thus, in the absence of a universal definition, it is of less value in Geopolitics than some of us might wish.

Oh, and when a leader of any nation puts the interests of another nation ahead of his own it is called "TREASON"

WOOF!
 
 
 
The Australians sent a naval task group through that area.

 

Not sure if you ever took a geography course but Australia is a lot closer to China than Canada is. What do you expect Canada to send out a fleet and get there how much longer? Take a hell of a lot less time for any other allies. Seriously thats like getting mad at your brother who lives 8 hours away for not feeding your dog when you could have just asked your neighbor.

Last time I checked, Egypt received more US aid than Israel.

Hmm. I thought Egypt was pegged at 75% of whatever we give Israel.

Doesn't really matter, it's a crappy deal either way...  

The fact that Israel scored equal to Canada on our little poll is pretty surprising though...they aren't even in the same league.
 
 
I don't think this one was listed but think about it.

SAUDI ARABIA

7%

Its a matter of perspective.

Think about how the Bush family and Bin Laden FAmily think about this. The Carlyle Group and oh did I mention 7%.
 
 
 
Think about how the Bush family and Bin Laden FAmily think about this.

 

I'm sure neither one consider the other "closest ally". I know a member of OBL's family, did some work for him at his home north of here. Nice fella, does internet access in a few ME countries. Nothing wrong with being his ally...
 
 
 
The US has many enemies but she also has many allies. I am curious to know who you all think the US's closest ally is. I don't necessarily means her strongest ally but her most loyal one. All of the choices I have put up as choices are close allies with the US. As for my vote I am not sure. I am torn between England, Canada, and Australia.

 

Hello, this is my first post.

Quite frankly, with the state of things, I think they'd all stab us in the back, given the opportunity.

I voted Canada, because they have the most to lose by our downfall.
 
 
I say Kuwait. They owe us one, and they know it. Unless we screw up royally, we've got at least most of them on our side for maybe half a century. Of course, other than oil and airbases, they're not that much help, but it's nice to know we've got a friend. Of course, they are crazy Arabs, so who knows?
 
 
 
I keep waiting for them to ask for statehood to save themselves from the Insanity of the EU...
 

Why would Britain have to become an American state if it left the EU?

Couldn't we just be an independent nation? We don't want to be a part of the EU or the US.

But, having said that, if we were an American state we'd be by far its largest.

No you wouldn't. Alaska would still remain the largest.
 
 
 
Canada seems to be going more and more to the multi-culturalism model of western europe.
 

Neither Canada nor Western Europe are anywhere near as multicultural as the US.
 
 
 
No you wouldn't. Alaska would still remain the largest.

 

Nope. Britain's population is 60 million - Alaska's population is probably around the size of Gloucestershire.

Next largest would be California - with only 30 million people.

If Britain became an American state, it would dominate.
 
 
And that's why we don't want you.

Indeed. You should have said "largest population."

I normally think of size of nations in terms of population size.

Land area is insignificant. There's no point of having a huge land area like Canada but having only 30 million people in it.

Even then, with the sheer physical size of Britain, we would probably seperate you into different states anyway; probably into England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
 
 
Boltonian,

You're assuming it would remain one state.

What do you think the Northern Irish, Scottish, Welsh, Cornish and more besides would think about that?

 
Land area is insignificant. There's no point of having a huge land area like Canada but having only 30 million people in it.

 

Apart from the fact that Canada makes the Middle East look resource-impoverished in comparison?

Dominate what? Federal politics? Not big enough.
 
 
 
Dominate what? Federal politics? Not big enough.

 

Indeed. You guys aren't special, no state is. It's 2 senators for each, and the House of Representatives isn't all that powerful.

I could see London dominating in the area of international trade though, and I could see alot more travel between New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Orlando and London happening though.
 
 
 
Quite frankly, with the state of things, I think they'd all stab us in the back, given the opportunity.
.

 

No way.. I'd say only lower class people in these nations are inclined to have animosity towards one another; the higher up the ladder you go, the more networked these nations are..

Charles Krauthammer backs me up:

 
Why I Love Australia
By Charles Krauthammer

WASHINGTON -- In the Australian House of Representatives last month, opposition member Julia Gillard interrupted a speech by the minister of health thusly: "I move that that sniveling grub over there be not further heard.''

For that, the good woman was ordered removed from the House, if only for a day. She might have escaped that little time-out if she had responded to the speaker's demand for an apology with something other than "If I have offended grubs, I withdraw unconditionally.''

God, I love Australia. Where else do you have a shadow health minister with such, er, starch? Of course I'm prejudiced, having married an Australian, but how not to like a country, in this age of sniveling grubs worldwide, whose treasurer suggests to any person who "wants to live under sharia law'' to try Saudi Arabia and Iran, "but not Australia.'' He was elaborating on an earlier suggestion that "people who... don't want to live by Australian values and understand them, well then they can basically clear off.'' Contrast this with Canada, historically and culturally Australia's commonwealth twin, where last year Ontario actually gave serious consideration to allowing its Muslims to live under sharia law.

Such things don't happen in Australia. This is a place where, when the remains of a fallen soldier are accidentally switched with those of a Bosnian, the enraged widow picks up the phone late at night, calls the prime minister at home in bed and delivers a furious unedited rant -- which he publicly and graciously accepts as fully deserved. Where Americans today sue, Australians slash and skewer.

For Americans, Australia engenders nostalgia for our own past, which we gauzily remember as infused with John Wayne plain-spokenness and vigor. Australia evokes an echo of our own frontier, which is why Australia is the only place you can unironically still shoot a Western.

It is surely the only place where you hear officials speaking plainly in defense of action. What other foreign minister but Australia's would see through "multilateralism,'' the fetish of every sniveling foreign policy grub from the Quai d'Orsay to Foggy Bottom, calling it correctly "a synonym for an ineffective and unfocused policy involving internationalism of the lowest common denominator''?

And with action comes bravery, from the transcendent courage of the doomed at Gallipoli to the playful insanity of Australian-rules football. How can you not like a country whose trademark sport has Attila-the-Hun rules, short pants and no padding -- a national passion that makes American football look positively pastoral?

That bravery breeds affection in America for another reason as well. Australia is the only country that has fought with the United States in every one of its major conflicts since 1914, the good and the bad, the winning and the losing.

Why? Because Australia's geographic and historical isolation has bred a wisdom about the structure of peace -- a wisdom that eludes most other countries. Australia has no illusions about the "international community'' and its feckless institutions. An island of tranquility in a roiling region, Australia understands that peace and prosperity do not come with the air we breathe, but are maintained by power -- once the power of the British Empire, now the power of the United States.

Australia joined the faraway wars of early-20th-century Europe not out of imperial nostalgia, but out of a deep understanding that its fate and the fate of liberty were intimately bound with that of the British Empire as principal underwriter of the international system. Today the underwriter is America, and Australia understands that an American retreat or defeat -- a chastening consummation devoutly, if secretly, wished by many a Western ally -- would be catastrophic for Australia and for the world.

When Australian ambassadors in Washington express support for the U.S., it is heartfelt and unalloyed, never the "yes, but'' of the other allies, perfunctory support followed by a list of complaints, slights and sage finger-wagging. Australia understands America's role and is sympathetic to its predicament as reluctant hegemon. That understanding has led it to share foxholes with Americans from Korea to Kabul. They fought with us at Tet and now in Baghdad. Not every engagement has ended well. But every one was strenuous, and many quite friendless. Which is why America has such affection for a country whose prime minister said after 9/11, "This is no time to be an 80 percent ally,'' and actually meant it.
 
 
 
Great article. I've always thought Aussies were awesome.
 
 
 
Neither Canada nor Western Europe are anywhere near as multicultural as the US.

 

How wrong you are, Canada is just as Multi-cultural as the US. Toronto is the most multi cultural City on the planet according to the UN, and Vancouver is within the top 5.

Unlike the Uk and the States, Canada is not blessed with alot of "easy" terrain. The majority of Canada is un-developable.

Try building on the Pre-cambrian shield which is made up of Granite, the worlds 5th hardest material, or try building on muskeg of the Hudson bay lowlands which can swallow entire sections of rail-line, or perma-frost, tundra, the arctic.... Or the millions of lakes and rivers (more lakes and rivers than any country in the world) then there are the mountains in BC and Yukon.

Just like how Russia is a huge country but the majority of the land is underpopulated and is concentrated in the west, because the land is just to harsh to develop
 
 
I voted Canada.

Because the States share the continent with Canada. Not to mention that they need us just as much as we need them. Among other things, Canada supplies the majority of America's imported Oil. Not to mention that we share the St.Lawrence Sea-way which is an incredibly important economic sea-way. And of course there is NORAD.

Not to nitpick, but -oh wait a second, I keep saying that don't I?   Let's be honest. I like nitpicking, and that's what this is.   So, to nitpick, with apologies: granite is by no means the world's 5th hardest material. It has no intrinsic hardness, being composed of several different minerals, ranging from mica that can be scratched by a fingernail, to quartz which is number 7 on the Mohs scale of hardness. Beryl, topaz, corundum, spinel, chrysoberyl, zircon, carborundum, and of course diamond are all harder than quartz. Again, sorry to nitpick.
 
 
Oh, and I would agree with your choice of Canada. Geographically speaking, it's undeniable, economically, it's defendable, and militarily, although we have differences, like you said, there's NORAD.
 
 
 
Neither Canada nor Western Europe are anywhere near as multicultural as the US.

 

Take a trip to London, it has a an extremely diverse population with people from just about every part of the planet. The UK as a whole has a rather diverse population, with people from different parts of the British Isles moving around; people from the EU and other parts of Europe coming to live and work here as well as people from farther afield, notably from the former Dominions and colonies.

ok here this may clear up what i ment...i guess i should be more clear in my discussions  

 Granite is in the 7-8 range on the Mohs scale, with 10 being the hardest and 1 the softest 
 
 
Oh come on, you're in Ottawa. Parliment got those things beat by a country mile.

Depends on the composition. Most granite is feldspar heavy, specifically orthoclase, which 6 on the Mohs scale. There is generally a large component of quartz, which is 7, and a varying amount of biotite and muscovite micas, which come in, IIRC, at 3. Depending on the granite, there may be large amounts of secondary minerals, which include beryl, hardness of 7-8, and corundum, hardness 9. Some granites may have non orthoclase feldspars in large amts, and those may vary in hardness, but are in the same range as orthoclase. Of course, that is all a bit irrelevant in construction. Granite is a favored construction material because of its durability and strength. Hardness, of course, has some bearing on that, especially durability. But you wouldn't want to build your house of diamonds, because they have a tendency to shatter.

Interesting thing about the Mohs scale. It is not, as many people think, a mathematical scale, like the Richter scale or Mach numbers. Mohs simply chose certain materials as benchmarks. Thus, you cannot say that an 8 is twice as hard as a 4. Diamond, for example, ranges from 5 to 10 times as hard as the next benchmark, corundum.
 
 
Well i live not to far from the precambrian shield, i go camping there alot. And all the roads have to be blasted out of the rock. Its really pretty driving through it, with 20+ foot shear rock faces parallel to the roads...it was all blasted out, you can even see the drill holes that the blasters drilled to place explosives.

but soil is very shallow on the Sheild, and most of it is bare exposed rock, and what soil there is, is acidic and not suitable for farming. That is why only coniferous trees can survive on the Sheild, they have evolved to flourish in shallow, acidic soil.

So while farming is very difficult, forestry and mining is suitable. The majority of the settlements up there are forest or mining towns.

And officer..Ottawa is situated on the Ottawa Valley, which is a relatively flat area with rich soils..it was created from runoff from the retreating glaciers that scraped the precambrian shield bare of its top soil as it moved along.
 
 
I live in Lanark County and I served in NDHQ for 3 years; not to mention all those times back and fourth between Area (Toronto), CFB Pet, and NDHQ. I know Ottawa very well.
 
 
you live in Lanark County officer??

I live in Carleton Place..i always say Ottawa because no one knows where CP is haha

Well, hello Neighbour, am around the Perth/Smiths Falls area. Alot of retiree military around here; including a couple of Cols, a BGen, and a MGen.
 
 
Id like to add some more reasons why Canada is light years ahead of other countries in being America's Closest Allie. And in turn, why America is Canada's closest ally.

taken from the U.S. Department of State website.

$1.4 billion a day in goods, services, and investment income--as well as in people-to-people contact, with well over 100 million crossings of the U.S.-Canadian border every year. In fields ranging from law enforcement cooperation to environmental cooperation to free trade, the two countries work closely on multiple levels from federal to local. In addition to their close bilateral ties, Canada and the U.S. work closely through multilateral fora.

Although Canada views good relations with the U.S. as crucial to a wide range of interests, it occasionally pursues independent policies at odds with the United States. In 2003, Canada did not participate in the U.S.-led military coalition that liberated Iraq (although it has contributed financially to Iraqs reconstruction and provided electoral advice). Other examples are Canadas leadership in the creation of the UN-created International Criminal Court (ICC) for war crimes--which the U.S. opposes due to fundamental flaws in the treaty that leave the ICC vulnerable to exploitation and politically motivated prosecutions--and Canadas decision in early 2005 not to participate directly in the U.S. missile defense program. The United States and Canada also differ on the issue of landmines. Canada is a strong proponent of the Ottawa Convention, which bans the use of anti-personnel mines. The United States, while the worlds leading supporter of demining initiatives, declined to sign the treaty due to unmet concerns regarding the protection of its forces and allies, particularly those serving on the Korean Peninsula, as well as the lack of exemptions for mixed munitions.

U.S. defense arrangements with Canada are more extensive than with any other country. The Permanent Joint Board on Defense, established in 1940, provides policy-level consultation on bilateral defense matters and the United States and Canada share NATO mutual security commitments. In addition, U.S. and Canadian military forces have cooperated since 1958 on continental air defense within the framework of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). The military response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 both tested and strengthened military cooperation between the United States and Canada. The new NORAD Agreement that entered into force on May 12, 2006 added a maritime domain awareness component and is of indefinite duration, albeit subject to periodic review. Since 2002, Canada has participated in joint military actions in Afghanistan. Approximately 2,300 Canadian Forces personnel are deployed in southern Afghanistan under a battle group based at Kandahar airfield and the Canadian-led Multi National Brigade for Regional Command South in Kandahar and as members of the Canadian-led Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) at Camp Nathan Smith in Kandahar. Canada has committed to maintain the PRT until February 2007 and to remain active in Afghanistan until at least 2009. Canada has also contributed to stabilization efforts in Haiti, initially with troops and later with civilian police and electoral assistance, and humanitarian and developmental aid.

The U.S. and Canada also work closely to resolve transboundary environmental issues, an area of increasing importance in the bilateral relationship. A principal instrument of this cooperation is the International Joint Commission (IJC), established as part of the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909 to resolve differences and promote international cooperation on boundary waters. The Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement of 1972 is another historic example of joint cooperation in controlling transboundary water pollution. The two governments also consult semiannually on transboundary air pollution. Under the Air Quality Agreement of 1991, both countries have made substantial progress in coordinating and implementing their acid rain control programs and signed an annex on ground level ozone in 2000. In June 2003, Canada and the U.S. announced a new border air quality initiative designed to increase cooperation in combating cross-border air pollution, including particulate matter. Three regional projects have been completed.

The United States and Canada enjoy an economic partnership unique in the world. The two nations share the worlds largest and most comprehensive trading relationship, which supports millions of jobs in each country. In 2005, total trade between the two countries was approximately $500 billion. The two-way trade that crosses the Ambassador Bridge between Michigan and Ontario equals all U.S. exports to Japan. Canada's importance to the United States is not just a border-state phenomenon: Canada is the leading export market for 39 of the 50 U.S. States, and ranked in the top three for another 8 States. In fact, Canada is a larger market for U.S. goods than all 25 countries of the European Community combined, whose population is more than 15 times that of Canada.

Canada is an urban services-dependent economy with a large manufacturing base. Since Canada is the largest export market for most states, the U.S.-Canada border is extremely important to the well-being and livelihood of millions of Americans.

The U.S. is Canada's leading agricultural market, taking nearly one-third of all food exports. However, imports of Canadian livestock products, particularly ruminants, fell drastically after the discovery of a single case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, mad cow disease) in spring 2003. Shipments of most Canadian beef to the U.S. were resumed in late 2003 and trade in live cattle under 30 months resumed in July 2005. Conversely, Canada is the second-largest U.S. agricultural market (after Japan), primarily importing fresh fruits and vegetables and livestock products.

The U.S. and Canada enjoy the largest energy trade relationship in the world. Canada is the single largest foreign supplier of energy to the United States--providing 17% of U.S. oil imports and 18% of U.S. natural gas demand. Recognition of the commercial viability of Canadas oil sands has raised Canadas proven petroleum reserves to 175 billion barrels, making it the worlds second-largest holder of reserves after Saudi Arabia. The electricity grids of the United States and Canada are closely linked and meet jointly developed reliability standards. Quebec is a major source of electricity for New England.

While law enforcement cooperation and coordination were excellent prior to the terrorist attacks on the United States of September 11, they have since become even closer through such mechanisms as the Cross Border Crime Forum. Canada, like the United States, has strengthened its laws and realigned resources to fight terrorism. U.S.-Canada bilateral and multilateral cooperation in the fight is exemplary. Canada is a significant source for the United States of marijuana, as well as precursor chemicals and over-the-counter drugs that are used to produce illicit synthetic drugs. Implementation and strengthening of regulations in Canada and increased U.S.-Canadian law enforcement cooperation have had a substantial impact in reducing trafficking of precursor chemicals and synthetic drugs, but cannabis cultivation, because of its profitability and relatively low risk of penalty, remains a thriving industry. Canada increased maximum penalties for methamphetamine offenses in August 2005 and implemented new controls over various precursors in November 2005.

Canada and the U.S. have one of the worlds largest investment relationships. The U.S. is Canada's largest foreign investor. Statistics Canada reports that at the end of 2004, the stock of U.S. foreign direct investment in Canada was $175 billion, or about 65% of total foreign direct investment in Canada. U.S. investment is primarily in Canada's mining and smelting industries, petroleum, chemicals, the manufacture of machinery and transportation equipment, and finance.

Canada is the seventh-largest foreign investor in the United States. At the end of 2004, the U.S. Commerce Department estimates that Canadian investment in the United States, including investments from Canadian holding companies in the Netherlands, was $134 billion at historical cost basis. Canadian investment in the United States is concentrated in manufacturing, wholesale trade, real estate, petroleum, finance, and insurance and other services.

Problaby England, but they are still part of the EU, which was set up by the French and Germans, to distance themselves away from the US. With England's SAS, RAF,Navy, German Engineers and French Infantry, they have a fighting chance of winning a war against the US. Australia is more loyal than England, as they copy almost everything US does, and has a very similar agenda and governments, but apart from their SAS and their very good weapons, they are quite weak in invading, but could certainly defend against a invasion by say, the US,China,Russia or the EU. Israel, after England, is their most useful ally, and Canada, can't really be classified as a ardent ally, as they did not fully participate in Iraq. And France, well I congratulate them for standing up to USA and not being bullied into a unneccesary war.
 
 
Actually it is Pakistan.

To be with the US, Musharraf is sacrificing the Moslems to the whims of the Great White Satan, even though he is manipulating some leeway.

Or, is he not?
 
 
Julie,

Aussies are not awesome.

They are awful AND terribly boorish.

Worse still, they don't speak English!  
 
 
Hey!

Where is triple V?

Don't see her at all these days!

Have news for you. We were more in than alot of the Coalitions of the Willing.
 
 
 
UK, not even close.

I keep waiting for them to ask for statehood to save themselves from the Insanity of the EU...not that i'd want them added as a state. Too many stinking lefties.  

 

How very insulting. I would suggest Canada is your greatest ally considering what we Canadians put up with when it comes to you nasty Americans.

Yet there we are doing the brunt of the work in Afghanistan. Let us never forget Canada has participated in far more peacekeeping missions than the US could ever hope to. This has resulted to Canadian Forces being strung out all over the globe much to our detriment and expense.

We Canadians were forced to hear your constant carping about our low military expenditures. Many times we have told you to shut the hell up and mind your own business.

Oh I almost forgot to mention - two of my colleagues are Indian and three are chinese..what a fun   and we all are working in USA.
 
 
Welcome aboard to all of you, and THANK YOU for obeying our rather modest immigration laws. You have no idea how grateful we are for that.

Well my company was taken over by an Icelandic Company. Now we have a VP whose name I can't pronounce (to many J and G in the name   ). But I love this diversity. By the way all the people described, they are in my department, one section of R&D   Wish Ray could be with me in a presentation. In 20 minutes either he will shoot some of them or catch the next flight back to India (my company is very near to Newark airport   )
 
 
 
Welcome aboard to all of you, and THANK YOU for obeying our rather modest immigration laws. You have no idea how grateful we are for that.

 

I can understand that. How many Illegal Immigrants now 12 million or 20 million? Come on think about all those nice manicured lawns..what will happen to them without Illegals?

Londonistan calling
Mark Steyn - Monday,28 August 2006

The Prime Minister made a great impression on his recent trip to London. I don't mean just the number of times I was told what a splendid chap this Simon Harper/ Stephen Cooper fellow was. My favourite proximation, by the way, was "Stephen Howard":
 
there's no higher praise than being taken for John Howard's cousin.
 

But, aside from that, I was struck by the way every speech was more robust than the circumstances required. For example, in an all but unreported address to the Canada-United Kingdom Chamber of Commerce (i.e., Air Canada, Alcan Europe and a lot of other go-along-to-get-along global corporate types), he said the following:

 
"Now I know it's unfashionable to refer to colonialism in anything other than negative terms. And certainly, no part of the world is unscarred by the excesses of empires. But in the Canadian context, the actions of the British Empire were largely benign and occasionally brilliant."
 

Holy cow! An Imperial Preference PM in 2006! Even with the qualifications Mr. Harper felt obliged to make, presumably for any BBC reporters in attendance, that's the nearest to a real appreciation of British imperialism that the mother country's heard in years. At one level, of course, it goes without saying. If you look at GDP per capita in countries with populations over 20 million, the top four are an Anglosphere sweep:America, Canada, Britain, Australia. As Mr. Harper's audience should surely appreciate, when it comes to delivering sustained democratic institutions and economic growth among large numbers of people, there is simply no comparison with the Britannic inheritance.

And, as Mr. Harper also noted, through the horrors of the 20th century these countries also did more than anybody else to defend and advance the cause of liberty.

But, if something goes without saying long enough, other voices fill the vacuum. And somewhere along the way a quintessentially British self-effacement curdled into a weirdly stunted civilizational self-loathing. The historical balance sheet isn't just about what might not have happened but what might have happened instead. Who would you rather be colonized by? Would you rather have St. Lucia's history or Haiti's? Singapore's or Indonesia's?

And yet Harper's unexceptional observations were incredibly exceptional, because nobody makes them, least of all in Britain. Par for the course is The Guardian's Decca Aitkenhead who, in a column on why Jamaican men are "homophobic', instantly identified the real culprit--the psychological damage of colonialism. "It's a failure to recognize 400 years of Jamaican history, starting with the sodomy of male slaves by their white owners as a means of humiliation," she wrote. "Jamaicans weren't the architects of their ideas about homosexuality; we were."

Crikey. If English public schoolboys hadn't taken these guys to the West Indies to be their ebony playthings under the Caribbean moon, they'd have stayed in Africa and grown up as relaxed live-and-let-live types like, er, Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe, who's accused Tony Blair of a plan to impose homosexuality throughout the Commonwealth; or Namibia's Sam Nujoma, who accused African homosexuals of being closet "Europeans" trying to destroy his country through the spread of "gayism." The magnificent perverseness of Miss Aitkenhead's argument suggests that, if anything, it's the mother country that's been psychologically damaged by imperialism.

These days, wherever I happen to be, I try to picture what the neighbourhood will be like in 20 years' time. Right now, I'm in Australia, one of the few western nations I'm 100 per cent confident will make it. Oz has its multiculti sappy side, too, but it lives in a tough part of the world and its political class is under fewer illusions than most. What of Canada? Like Europe, it's over-invested in a dud idea: indeed, at one level the European Union is merely a more elaborate version of the Trudeaupian animating principle that one's identity is defined by the degree to which one is not like America. For a while, I thought that the best chance of saving the deranged Dominion from Europe's fate was geography: the Americans simply wouldn't permit their nearest neighbor to go kaput. But, after barely six months of a weak minority government in which at least one of the key portfolios is wielded by the emptiest of empty suits, Stephen Harper has nevertheless succeeded in modestly changing the tone. On Afghanistan, on Hezbollah, at the G8, he's been grown up, clear sighted, rooted in a genuine sense of what Canada's values ought to be. This is what leadership is supposed to be about. Given that, whatever their other grievances, the electorate seemed content with the Liberal policy of passing off Canada's global irrelevance as moral courage, Harper could so easily have opted for the usual poll-driven finger-in-the-windiness. Instead, he opted to lead--to raise the rhetorical stakes, to make the case, and hope enough folks are open to persuasion to come along.

But, in a world in which the prospects for the Anglosphere are better than almost anybody else's, there is one bleak exception. At some point soon, we're going to be asking: Who lost Britain? In the weeks after last year's tube bombing, I doubted that the clarion call for a reassertion of "British identity" would last, and so it proved. By the first anniversary, Britain was back in its peculiarly resistant multiculti mush in which the proper reaction to such unfortunate events is to abase oneself ever more abjectly before the gods of cultural relativism. What matters after mass slaughter on the Underground is not the wound to the nation but the potential for hurt feelings of certain minorities. Had the latest disrupted terrorist plot to take down up to ten UK-US airplanes actually succeeded, I'm sure it would have gone much the same--BBC discussion panels on which representatives of Muslim lobby groups warn of outbreaks of Islamophobia. Even as Heathrow and all other British airports were shut down, Shahid Malik, MP for Dewsbury, the neighborhood that produced the July 7th bombers, explained the situation: "The action of Israel and the inaction of the West is contributing to the difficult task of tackling extremism." Deconstruct that--because it's the most artful extension of Jew-blaming in centuries: even Hitler never thought to complain that those bloody Jews were provoking Germans into blowing up their fellow Germans. Of course, it's ludicrous. This plot was well advanced long before the first Israeli strike against Hezbollah--despite the truly contemptible way Reuters, the BBC and other British media outlets inserted reflexively a causal connection.

But suppose Mr. Malik's words were true--that the actions of the Zionist Entity are so repellent they drive British subjects to plot mass murder against their fellow British subjects. What does that imply? That, well before push comes to shove, the primary identity of those nominal "Britons" is not British and never will be.

Tony Blair, it seems to me, will go down as a tragic figure. Unlike Jean Chrétien, who was almost eerily unmoved in the wake of 9/11 and unmoveable in the months afterward, the British prime minister grasped immediately the bigger picture and outlined it better than President Bush. He still does. But the citizens of the United Kingdom never accepted it as their war, and they still don't. Even after the July 7th bombings. Historians will be baffled by Blair, a man who thinks nothing of diagnosing the ills of distant continents but is rendered inarticulate and incoherent when it comes to a strategy for the home front. To read Londonistan, Melanie Phillips' superb analysis on the jihad's gaming of Britain, is to realize that the country is increasingly a more sophisticated version of Afghanistan, Lebanon or Somalia--a husk of a nation in which darker forces have set up shop, and in which establishment complacency, hard-left multiculturalism and an ever more Europeanized bureaucracy have made it all but impossible for the state to rouse itself. Britannia has demonstrated in Afghanistan and Iraq that she can still just about summon the "war will" on the battlefield. On the broader cultural front, where this war in the end will be won, there's little evidence of any kind of will. When one considers the impunity with which the country's incendiary imams incite treason, it requires a perverse genius on the part of Tony Blair to have found the political courage to fight an unpopular war on a distant shore but not the political courage to wage it closer to home where it would have commanded far more support. That's the sad lesson of the July 7th bombings: the British government has a strategy for southern Iraq but not southern England.

Britain's language, culture, legal system and political tradition have been the greatest single force for good in shaping the modern world. But discarding its own inheritance and yoking its future to a Eutopian pseudo-federation has left it constitutionally (in every sense) incapable of resisting the depredations of more motivated forces. Unless things change in a big way, there won't always be an England.
 

Emphasis mine, and it should be yours, too. Indian members, read the blue bolded parts again. You haven't really absorbed it, and you are probably culturally incapable of it, as you're all so heavily invested in nationalism and the natural tendency of resisting the notion that you are beholden to another nation's culture for the greatness of your own country, PLUS what you have been taught since birth about the sordidness of your precious British inheritence and the purity of your own benighted culture.

I also wanted to use the article to (once again) bolster my point that Australia is America's best ally and international soul mate. Read the red bolded parts to find those well-made, common-sense points.

But that's just oblique points to the real purpose of the article. The true point of the article is that some countries are not going to come through the other side of this war in any recognizable form. Mine may not, either. We are now faced with a threat that might, even if it fails to acieve all that it attempts, succeed in annihilating the most valuable parts of our civilization.

Get behind the program NOW, because it's going to get worse, and soon.

Mine will. I know my people, and we're already taking English refugees in unprecedented numbers. To balance it we're getting whack-loads of Zimbabweans at the moment too. (and Americans, but they're liberals fleeing GW. One of them called me an NRA supporter the other day   )
As for Europe, I see Dales vision of the rest of the world intervening to stop the ovens being fired up as the most realistic. Those Euros are a nutty lot, I should know, I'm mostly decended from them.
(oh, and Scotland will survive and reconquer England)
 
 
 
Mine will. I know my people, and we're already taking English refugees in unprecedented numbers.

 

Ah yes, the white flight i spoke of in earlier threads. The one that manifests itself as the most cowardly and timid of the UK whites cowardly run like rats from a sinking ship from the muslim-pakistani horde.

Good for you...???

Not quite. To generalise, as we are doing here, the true cowards stay put and surrender.
Having said that however, they seem to expect us to be a little piece of foreign soil that is forever England. Discovering that even whiteys like me ain't nothing like 'colonials' and that I can have entire conversations with people of which they cannot understand a word comes as somewhat of a surprise.
The fact that my local corner shop owner is Fijian Indian and that he and I can have a conversation IN ENGLISH and they still can't understand a word is even funnier
I think their view of the world froze somewhere about 1920.
Still, like the vast majority of the refugees we take here, they're welcome if they are willing to add to the whole.
 
 
Australia in my opinion is the best ally. The UK is debatable - it depends on the political situation within the UK, too many lefties. The current foreign policy is under heavy attack by opposition parties. (I have a clip of a Respect Party idiot rattling on like an ass and attacking Murdock which appearing on a Sky interview) Popular public opinion drives the political machine especially during election years. Canada has its share of lefties. The US however is highly regarded overall. Stephen Harper is a man to count on. Israel will always be a strong ally. France - they are their own worst enemies! You would not want to depend on them!

guys i believe that among the contenders first of all 1) Israel is more like a option for USA than an ally it only intention is to keep a stronghold presence in the middle -east moreover, it supports israel as a son.
Secondly, i would say that australia is a kind of give and take partners coz of some force and all.
France not at all a very motivating partner.
The main competition is between UK and Canada

Mark Steyn - Monday,28 August 2006.............................
 

 

One notorious right wing Islamophobe writes (another) article, another Islamophobe holds it up and says "Look,this is what I have been saying all along". What are we to learn from that.

(But I do agree that in Europe we have to do something about non-integration and tighten up on immigration. Allowing non inclusive faith schools is definitely not the way to go).
 
 
'Islamophobia' means an irrational fear of Islam.

If you simply mean he hates Islam, then I hardly see how that is a presumed criticism considering you dislike multiculturalism.
 
 
 
One notorious right wing Islamophobe writes (another) article, another Islamophobe holds it up and says "Look,this is what I have been saying all along". What are we to learn from that.

 

Well, here's what I learn from your sentence: that you wouldn't recognize a threat if it held a bloody knife in front of your eyes while screaming 'Allahu Akbar!'

You and others just like you will watch passively as your nation is lost to an ideology of hatred. You'll see it happen in your lifetime (if you're fortunate enough to avoid being killied on a train or a jet in the intervening next few years, that is).

You use the descriptor 'phobe' rather more freely than you're entitled to. Radical Islam is a threat. You don't need to acknowledge that for it to be true. And I don't need your approval to state it.

Correct

 
Well, here's what I learn from your sentence: that you wouldn't recognize a threat if it held a bloody knife in front of your eyes while screaming 'Allahu Akbar!'

 

I would feel somewhat threatened.

My problem is with your view that the threat is "Islam", all Muslims. I dont agree. Our enemy is a malignant strand within Muslimhood. This strand is as repugnant to other Muslims as it is to us, and they are even more threatened by them than we are. What is more we need their help to fight our enemy and by misidentifying other Muslims as the enemy we are alienating them.

I know that you think that to be a Muslim automatically means a striving for the Umma above all else. But for most Muslims this is simply a sense of community or solidarity, and have no plans to impose a caliphate on the world. Yes, I know a poll showed 40% of Muslims in the UK want to see Sharia law, but from my experience many Muslims want that only in a limited fashion, -to settle certain disputes etc. Theres no telling what that poll means. That same poll showed only a 1% approval rating amongst British Muslims for the 7/7 bombings.

Sure, I resent the fact that immigrants feel able to come and live in the country and yet reject the culture. But I do not feel threatened by that per se, although it does warrant addressing. I do feel threatened by the radical fundamentalists that are nurtured, -albeit in small numbers (the numbers of potential terrorists plus the numbers who might be tempted to support or encourage them are into the thousands, according to MI5 and SY figures).

So tell me. When I catch my flight to Florida, what is the risk to me, say as compared to a motor vehicle accident or a fatal deep vein thrombosis on the way?
 
 
 
That same poll showed only a 1% approval rating amongst British Muslims for the 7/7 bombings.

 

So that's about 16,400 terrorists in the UK...
 
 
 
So tell me. When I catch my flight to Florida, what is the risk to me, say as compared to a motor vehicle accident or a fatal deep vein thrombosis on the way?

 

Lets see. There is a group of people, bound by a particular ideology who are intent on doing you harm. While not all or perhaps not even the majority of these ideological followers wish you harm, nevertheless a significant number of them do.

This groups ideology has wished you this harm even by your own admission since at least the eighties, athough both myself and snipe would argue that it has been going on much longer than that, and the latest series is simply a continuation of war by another means and has escalated simply because the oportunity to cause you harm has increased, mostly by the improved ability to travel and emmigrate.

This group has successfully killed 56 and injured many more of your fellow countrymen, and has had two other attempts on an even larger scale intercepted by your police with 11 people on charges and a further 17 being interrogated. And you would equate this with deep vein thrombosis or a traffic accident, both entirely random acts?

I have a chance to be affected by any of these. I can also get mugged if I decide to wander around Miami, and my house could get burgled in the mean time, -deliberate acts. All af these things are risks and can therefore be compared. When I risk my life, the precautionary actions I take are related to the degree of risk and the necessity of the activity that exposes me to the risk, as well as the feasabililty, ease, cost and, particularly, effectiveness of the precautionary action.
 
 
 
So that's about 16,400 terrorists in the UK...

 

No. Casting a vote for approval in a poll doesn't necessarily mean being a terrorist, or even an intent to assist in terrorism. These ratings go up and down. For most casting a vote of approval is simply an emotional reaction, to express misgivings of either their personal situation, or the government's policy.

To illustrate: a poll conducted and used in Channel 4 program "Dispatches" one month ago showed 23% percent of Muslims in Britain approved of the 7/7 attacks. What was edited out of the program was that the same poll showed that 21% of a control group of white native non-Muslim Brits also approved of the 7/7 attacks. These figures are likely to represent an emotional reaction to Lebanon (edit: =my interpretation)

Obviously, potential terrorists -radicalised Muslims- would vote approval every time, and would only make up a minority of the 1% approvers in the poll I quoted, which was an ICM poll quoted in the Daily Telegraph 6 months ago, if you believe M15 figures.
 
 
 
No.

 

Hey, if you think it's kewl to blow up babies, then you're a terrorist in my book. Their reasoning doesn't matter to me one bit.

According to me? No, according to the polls you're talking about. I don't even believe in polls.   But, if that's what the % of people in support of the attacks were, then you have that many terrorism supporters don't you?

Its true that I value human life and rights to a level that is above average for this board. But my views are based on a calculation of what will be the best way to defeat the threat from radical Islamism to the West, and it aint what were doing.

Edit: I have incorporated the rest of this post  here , cos the repetitions seemed daft.
 
 
 
Israel is a US stronghold in the Middle East? How do you figure?

 

How do you figure it's not?

Push comes to shove, and an all out war occurs, and Israel is no more than a US airbase and port.

C'mon top, the foriegners already know that...  

This is not to say that at other times they're not at least as much 'nuisance'(read that borderline enemy at times) as they are friend...cause they are. Spying little bastarhds.

Back to the OP, which I, bulldog-like, still want to argue over: America's Closest Ally, I continue to insist, is Australia. Here's more Steyn to say why that is so, because he's so much better at making the point:

 
Mark Steyn: Straight-talking PM
In comparison with the US and Britain, the Howard Government's policies and pronouncements on the main issues facing the West are setting a refreshingly honest example
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

08sep06

JOHN Howard was quoted approvingly on a US radio show last week. Big deal, you say. He's a prime minister; what does he care if some rinky-dink talk-jockey recycles a couple of sound bites?

Well, the radio host in question was Rush Limbaugh, and Rush has more listeners than there are Australians. That's to say, about 25million or so listeners, which is more than the number of Australians in Australia and Lebanon combined.
Why would gazillions of American radio listeners appreciate a line from Howard? Because he says things that none of their own leaders ever quite say. Last week it was the stuff about Muslim immigrants needing to learn English and making sure they're cool with this equal-rights-for-women business. The soi-disant arrogant Texas cowboy rarely shoots from the lip like that. Instead, he says things such as: "Freedom is the desire of every human heart."

Look, I'm a supporter of the Bush doctrine to spread liberty throughout the Muslim world, but I support it on hard-headed grounds of national security. You only have to watch a couple of minutes of the lads in Gaza and southern Lebanon on the telly every night to realise freedom comes pretty low down on the list of their hearts' desires. So, when the US President insists on reprising the line week in week out, he begins to sound utopian, if not utterly deluded. American conservatives would appreciate a rationale less hermetically sealed from reality.

By contrast, the Prime Minister's rhetoric meets what the law used to regard as the "reasonable man" test. When Howard refers to blokes "raving on about jihad" and the way that those so inclined are "utterly antagonistic" to a free society, he's merely stating the obvious in a way that other Western leaders can't quite bring themselves to do. His words align with reality, and one can't underestimate the value of that.

The other day, on a flight from Malaga to Manchester, a bunch of holidaying Brits mutinied and demanded the removal of two suspicious "Asian" passengers in "heavy clothes" and "checking their watches". The evicted passengers appear to be blameless, but the other travellers had spent the days since the Heathrow arrests listening to British government ministers trotting out the usual hooey about how the improved security procedures would be impeccably non-discriminatory and they seem to have concluded, reasonably enough, that although the new rules may prevent your toothpaste, Diet Coke and gel-filled bra (to name three now prohibited items) from boarding, they were unlikely to stop the mad bombers getting on.

In other words, the more the gulf widens between the Government's multiculti PC pap and the obvious truth, the more the state risks de-legitimising itself in the eyes of the citizenry. Tony Blair has a good pitch when he's surveying the distant horizon and the big picture and doing his Tone of Arabia routine, but he hasn't yet managed to find a line on the homegrown jihad that resonates with his electorate. If I ran the speechwriting departments in the White House and Downing Street, Howard's bloke's-eye view would be the working template.

As someone who's been citing Canberra's finest across the US long before Limbaugh and the other Aussie-come-latelys jumped in, I like to think of myself as a kind of honorary cultural attache, like Dame Edna's friend Sir Les Patterson, but with less stained trousers. I'm aware, after my trip to Australia last month, that various local lefties think I'm as nutty in this respect as Steve Irwin when he hailed Howard as "the greatest leader in the world". Perhaps it takes a croc hunter to appreciate a crock hunter: a politician with a keen eye for fashionable baloney and a willingness to wrestle it to the ground.

Still, I do think it's worth considering why, of the three doughty warriors of the Anglosphere, Howard has managed to avoid the traps that have ensnared George W. Bush and Blair.

For example, while Australia has some of the sweetest republicans in the Commonwealth, the Prime Minister's cultural conservatism strikes me as well grounded: in a time of rapid international and economic change, you have to prioritise, you can't put everything up for grabs, unto the flag and the crown. The day after the London bombings, Blair said that the terrorists would not be allowed to "change our country or our way of life". Of course not. That's his job, from accelerating European integration to his "reform" of the House of Lords. The British Prime Minister has turned the upper chamber into a house of cronies, the Islamists would like to make it a house of imams.

But once you accept the idea of tearing up a thousand years of history, the rest is largely a difference of degree. After a decade of modish vandalism, Blair has abandoned a lot of his sillier novelties because he's belatedly understood the dangers that arise when your citizens start to feel unmoored from their past. Howard didn't need to learn that on the job.

One should be cautious about comparisons between any nation and even its closest allies. Australia, it was pointed out to me on my recent foray, has compulsory voting, unlike the US, where turnout is 50 per cent, give or take, and much of the experts' energy is expended in trying to figure out ways to make sure the opposition's voters stay home. In theory, Australia's system, by requiring parties to attract the votes of the allegedly less partisan centre, ought to tend towards a more moderate politics.

Yet, among the governments of the main English-speaking nations, the Howard ministry is the least wishy-washily centrist: on jihad, on education, on immigration.

In the US, Republicans are meant to be the daddy party but Bush's riffs on Islam ("religion of peace") and illegal immigration ("family values don't stop at the Rio Grande") are almost all mommy talk and despised as intellectually dishonest by many conservatives.

So how does Howard, with a 100per cent turnout and all those supposed moderates to woo, get away with the daddy talk? Australians are not ostentatiously right-wing or even terribly conservative. But it seems that when you toss the entire electorate into the voting booth, there's a big market among the not especially partisan for a party that disdains political correctness.

Alexander Downer's contempt for "lowest common denominator multilateralism" isn't especially right-wing or left-wing: outside the ABC studios and universities and assorted ethnic grievance-mongers, it's an unexceptional observation. So Australia has, if not quite publicly, suspended the absurd deference to postmodern sovereignty that characterises the UN era. By comparison with Washington, it's honest about and comfortable with a modest, qualified neo-imperialism throughout the Pacific's "arc of instability". The Americans could learn a lot from the policy as well as from the Aussies' ease with it.

Obviously Australia is, in one sense, a small, distant nation and thus has a freer hand on Iraq than the US and on the wider jihad than Britain, which is in danger of turning into Somalia with chip shops. And, if I'm honest, there are certain aspects of Australian life that I find problematic, from gun laws to a still over-regulated economic environment. But, granted those and a few other caveats, Australia's is the only Western government on top of the three big challenges facing the developed world: not just the jihad but the more basic issue of civilisational confidence (hence the history summit) and the structural weaknesses of ageing Western democracies: Peter Costello's call for "one for mum, one for dad, one for Australia" is better put than any British minister would dare (though the fecund Blair certainly leads by example).

Just as the advantage of federalism is the local experimentation it allows, so on everything from basic post-9/11 temperament to regional military interventions the present Aussie Government is a kind of useful pilot scheme for the rest of the Anglosphere. I only wish the ghastly, intellectually barren British Conservatives would learn a thing or two from it.

As for my own nation, I've left Canada out of this discussion but I'm modestly encouraged by small signs of Australianisation. Our new Prime Minister was in London recently and a couple of local Tories told me how impressed they were: "Splendid chap, this new man of yours, Stephen Howard." Close enough. When a Canadian PM gets mistaken for John Howard's cousin, that's higher praise than we've had in decades.

I know I quote this guy's stuff a lot, but dammit, he keeps making such excellent points, and proving just how RIGHT my point was (about Australia being our best ally):

 
A great and powerful Oz
Mark Steyn - Monday,11 September 2006

Obviously foreign countries are the easiest to write about : "Through the haze, I could see camel caravans crossing the Niger river," etc. That's Joseph C. Wilson IV's famous New York Times editorial about whether or not Saddam was trying to acquire uranium from Niger--a bad travelogue that nevertheless catapulted him to the world's longest 15 minutes of fame.

But countries that are apparently just like your own are much harder to get into the real rhythm of. On the face of it, Australia is much like Canada: the streets have the same names (Wellington, Grosvenor, and so on), and there's usually a statue of Queen Victoria and/or a bunch of buildings bearing her moniker. Canada and Australia are, as we used to say, the two senior dominions--though their respective confederations (1867, 1901) are separated by a third of a century and very different political climates within the Empire. Still, I didn't really start thinking about the big differences between the two until my fourth or fifth day down under, when, at a conference in Queensland, the governor general strolled over to say hello.

I hasten to add that's not the big difference. True, I find it hard to imagine the governor general of Canada seeking me out with such enthusiasm. But I'm reluctant to measure a nation solely by its deference to one's own eminence, mindful that that's pretty much why Arthur Miller, Harold Pinter et al. loved the Soviet Union. Rather, what struck me was the startling character of the viceregal personage. He was (a) white; (b) male; and (c) a retired major-general.

What happened? A freak computer virus? To the best of my knowledge, there's no de jure constitutional prohibition against a white male with a military background serving as Canada's governor general, but, if it hasn't been formally read into the Charter of Rights by Madame L'Heureux-Dubé, it might just as well have been. If you've got a name like Gord MacKinnon, don't hold your breath waiting for the nod to pack for Rideau Hall. And Major-General Michael Jeffery isn't just some blue-helmeted peacekeepy type. He led the Australian SAS--i.e., special forces, the toughest hombres on the squad. He won the Military Cross in Vietnam and still believes that that war was the right thing to do. He headed Australia's national counter-terrorism strategy team.

In other words, if you wanted to devise the precise opposite of Michaëlle Jean, this is what he'd look like. He has never introduced pro-Castro documentaries on public television. He is not married to a cocktail revolutionary. To the best of my knowledge, he did not explain his appointment by saying that the prime minister "gave it to me because I'm hot." The night before His Excellency and I shared our little chat, I'd seen him up on stage presenting a couple of awards, a tall man of martial bearing, checked shirt and blazer, a bluff confident off-the-cuff speaker with a bonhomous jest about the Royal Australian Air Force bombers for a fellow veteran and some splendid remarks about the virtues of clarity in writing for a journalistic recipient. It would have been an unremarkable viceregal performance in Canada, say, 40 years ago, when our own major-general GG, Georges Vanier, was in residence, or 60 years ago, when Viscount Alexander was at Rideau Hall. But to the subjects of Trudeaupian Canada it would have seemed as alien in tone as if the Marquess of Dufferin had returned from the grave.

To those who regard Canada's highest office as a self-parodying affirmative action program, bumping implausibly from the country's first female Asian Canadian immigrant anglophone host of left-wing CBC shows to the country's first female black Canadian immigrant francophone host of even more left-wing CBC shows, critics might riposte that our gal is cooler than some squaresville Legion type. Which may be true, if you define cool as a laboured accumulation of desperate multiculti brownie points. But it's also revealing, I'd say, about how our respective nations see themselves.

A couple of days later, an unnamed very senior mega-important super-duper government official (as The New York Times says when it's leaking details of U.S. national security programs) told me that, after untold meetings during the Chrétien-Martin years, he'd concluded that Canada, like New Zealand, saw itself not as a country but as an NGO. That's not just a very funny but also a very shrewd characterization, perfectly encapsulating the Trudeaupian state's abasement before transnational pieties--to the point where we regard it as entirely natural that Canadian foreign policy has nothing to do with national interest (assuming we still have one) or even basic morality. The last time I can recall hearing about Lloyd Axworthy was just before the fall of the Taliban, when he turned up in Pakistan to protest that American military action risked jeopardizing relief supplies.

He seemed to be enjoying being part of an actual NGO operation rather than a pseudo one. Once again, the difference between Mme Jean and Major-General Jeffery seems instructive: Axworthy's Canada had attitudes rather than policies, and the fierceness of its attitude was as a general rule inversely proportional to the likelihood of it ever acting upon it--Kyoto being only the most shameless example. Australia, on the other hand, is an old-fashioned nation state: it has responsibilities rather than attitudes. A few days into my trip to the Antipodes, I'd heard so often the line that Canada to America is like New Zealand to Australia, that I began proposing an alternative: Canada to America is like Indonesia to Australia--crazy joint to the north where half the people are jumping up and down shouting, "Death to the Great Satan!" But, after mulling it over, I decided this was unfair to the Indonesians. The world's largest Muslim nation is a fragile democracy, to be sure, but it seems, for the moment, to be doing quite a good job holding down the Islamists.

It was in Canberra that I first heard the phrase "Australia's sphere of influence." Obviously, it's a little difficult for us to have a "sphere of influence," as Canada itself is in America's sphere of influence. But, on the other hand, these days France and Germany and so on don't have much of a sphere of influence either. The Aussies have no choice. They live in a tough neighbourhood. I don't just mean Indonesia and China, but East Timor, Australia's former colony of Papua New Guinea, and a string of islands hastily decolonized by Britain in the eighties--the Solomons, Vanuatu, Tuvalu, Nauru, and the rest of the so-called "arc of instability." China and Taiwan have been competing to buy up local pols and both parties have plenty of walking-around money, so Canberra has responded with a forceful if not quite publicly stated doctrine of conditional sovereignty. In failed and failing states, John Howard's government installs, according to need, troops and/or cops and/or Aussie judges, police commissioners and other bureaucrats, the principal aim being to provide an environment inimical to corruption. By comparison with Washington, they're honest about and comfortable with this qualified neo-imperialism, and the Americans could learn a lot both from the policy and from the Aussies' ease with it.ÊBut in Canadian terms you're struck yet again by the difference embodied in our respective viceregal potentates, by the difference between attitude and action. Canada has a hard and honourable mission in Afghanistan, but it's acting in support of larger powers, whether the U.S. or NATO. We're all but incapable of projecting force on our own. Australia plays a similar role in Afghanistan and Iraq, but in its backyard, in East Timor and the Solomons, it shoulders the burden itself and just gets on with it.

Is this just the reality of geography? That a nation without America next door can't be so smugly self-indulgent of every multiculti fatuity? Up to a point.

But it wasn't always like that. Until 60 years ago, we were an important second-rank power with a profile in the world that extended beyond the shadow of the colossus. Today, we have a population 50 per cent bigger than Australia's (at the moment, that is: our fertility rates are lower than theirs, and our society is aging faster) but we have a global influence a good 50 per cent less. Stephen Harper has managed to restore our reputation in small and mainly symbolic ways, but, from the viceregal office down, the props of the Trudeaupian state remain in place. There was another phrase I heard a lot around the Oz foreign affairs corridors: a "busted ****" country, which is certainly a livelier term than "failed state." Posterior-wise, ours is sagging rather than busted, but, if we want to avoid joining that category, we could do a lot worse than learn from the admirable Aussies.
 
 
 
the Aussies might sing the tune you like, but isn't it odd that Australian troops tend not to be the ones patrolling?

the Aussie contribution is both minimal compared to their military capability and highly selective in ensuring that its troops are not exposed to danger.

i like Australia, and personally i rather like their attitude to retaining their culture and language - but i also have many relatives there, go there regularly, watch their TV and read their newspapers. in East Timor, in Afghanistan and in Iraq, the most important part of an Aussie deployment is keeping its troops safe. thats what they care about, and well done to them for not spilling their blood while convincing the gullible that they are at the forefront of the fight.

if you want a rousing speech slagging off the pessimists thats great, if you want a high profile instant deployment to wave the flag that can be arranged, but if you want an infantry battalion to cover Basra for six months you can whistle.

think again.
 
 
But that's not the biggest part of what I'm talking about, dave. They're better MEN. They've got a better country, and they know themselves and like themselves better than the majority of the effeminate, emasculated and ennervated EUtopians that have become so inward-looking and self-regarding that they simply aren't worth the powder it would take to blow 'em to hell.

They're more American than most New Yorkers, and for that fact alone, I say they're better friends and allies to America than even the UK (which I'm fond of, grateful to, and dismayed about the current and irretreivable slide into irrelevent moral paralysis).

The Aussies can keep that infantry battalion at home - and so can the Brits, for all the good it does - as long as they can be counted on the feild where it counts the most.

MSgt,

Forgive me but Mark Steyn's words are now quite empty. The British are being counted on the field where it counts the most. Nineteen at most recent count; along with 5 Canadians. We are no longer supporting bigger powers (be it the US or NATO) in our goals. We're the ones who are leading the charge... even when others refused to follow... including the Australians.
 
 
 
I know I quote this guy's stuff a lot, but dammit, he keeps making such excellent points, and proving just how RIGHT my point was (about Australia being our best ally):

 

Ha! you don't have to live next door to them  
 
 
 
- as long as they can be counted on the feild where it counts the most.

 

oh they can be counted on to be in the field when the **** really hits the fan. that field will be in Darwin while every other f*cker is in Afghanistan and Iraq.

as for the rest of your diatribe, i'll leave that in the toilet where it belongs.

if i lived in a country where the most popular politicians of recent times were Bill Clinton, John Kerry, G W Bush, Al Gore, Howard Dean, Pat Buchannon and Dick Cheney i'd keep my f*cking hole shut about Ubermench.
 
 
 
as for the rest of your diatribe, i'll leave that in the toilet where it belongs.

 

And this was better?
 
 
 
And this was better?

 

Confed,

I am going to side with the Captain. The ONLY thing the Australians done better was to outshown the Canadians. That's it! They've raised their flag where we did not. They have NOT outdone the Brits. They have NOT outdone the Canadians.

More Brits and Canadians have died in this war than Australians which makes Mark Steyn's words a COMPLETE LIE! So, their Governor General (a CEREMONIAL Office) is better ours. Which General of theirs matches MGen Lewis MacKenzie? East Timor was a proud mission, a bold mission... BUT in NO way does it even compare to UNPROFOR, let alone the ISAF.

When compared to words, the Australians have done their part. When compared to deeds, the Brits and Canadians have done far more.
 
 
 
Confed,

I am going to side with the Captain.

 

I was refering to the way it was said, and not what was said. I do not dispute the point.
 
 
Mark Styne: "Canada has a hard and honourable mission in Afghanistan, but it's acting in support of larger powers, whether the U.S. or NATO."

This is complete ********

For 13 years, Canada's military has seen nothing by cuts. Canada's military today is but a shadow of what it was in the 50's.

Canada's military hasnt beein in an official combat situation since Korea. The Canadian public are warry of war, because 50 years of peackeeping as engraved the words "Canada" and "peackeeping" into a mindset that we are only supposed to be peackeepers. And "war" doesnt match up well in that equation.

I believe that given the right reasons (truth), and a debate (i believe a debate which states the facts will work in stephen harpers favour) will turn this tide of support against the mission in afghanistan, into support for it.

The only thing that keeps Canada from projecting its own power is the lack of air power, and havey sea lift capability. Our army is more than capable on the gound, as afghanistan is proving. However we still rely on American and British air power for cover. And untill our new transport ships are ready, we still rely on private contracts to ship our equipment around the place.

Mark Styne speaks like we are just some boy scout tag-along. Sure under the Liberals it was looking like that was the CF future, but under the Conservatives i think that is going to be changed.

HOLD ON ONE SECOND THERE! I do not like the chances of our 50's force against today's force. Too much has changed for our daddy's army to have a a chance in today's world.

The Canadian people are warry of war, because 50 years of peackeeping as engraved the words "Canada" and "peackeeping" into a mindset that we are only supposed tp be peackeepers. And "war" doesnt match up well in that equation.

 

HORSE PUCKY! We're the 2nd most deployed army in NATO and with that, the 2nd most experienced army in NATO. Do you think it's by accident that 3 PPCLI can fit right in with the US 187th Infantry Brigade in the middle of a shooting war without blinking an eye? Or that Canada has lead the charge in 6 NATO combat missions?

 
I believe that given the right reasons (truth), and a debate (i believe a debate which states the facts will work in stephen harpers favour) will turn this tide of support against the mission in afghanistan, intp support for it.

 

Son, we're bleeding and we're crying. It's natural. Just shut up and let us bleed and cry.

Oh, horse pucky! We're allies. They do their jobs so that we can do ours.

 
Mark Styne speaks like we are just some boy scout ta-alon. Sure under the Liberals it was looking like that was the CF future, but under the Conservatives i think that is going to be changed.

 

WRONG! The CF will be what the CF makes it to be. MGen Lewis MacKenzie succeeded. MGen Romeo Dallaire failed. MGen Andrew Leslie suceeded. LGen Carron just carried on. MGen Cameron Ross resigned in protest. LGen Mike Jefferies carried out the ISAF mission.

I'm not doubting the experience that the CF has. What i am saying is preach that to the thin majority in this country, who thinks that our military are nothing by peacekeepers and dont actually fight wars. And want to pull us out so that we can build houses and plant daisies.

According to anderson cooper last night on CNN, afghanistan in the first ground war EVER for NATO.

Australia is VERY good as an ally, because although they don't bring a lot of physical strength to the table, philosophically they're true-blue and loyal.

Howard was just returned as Australian Prime Minister, and he is very closely identified with Dubya.

Contrast that with Tony Blair, who, although a strong and loyal ally, has to fight the 'Bush's Poodle' slander, and in so doing has sometimes had to distance himself and show his independence of the US for doemstic political considerations.

So the Brits are sacrificing and actually doing the heavy lifting in the War on Terror right alongside of us - but the grumble and ***** the whole way. Aussies aren't making as much of a contribution, but I have a sense they don't resent what they are doing, and wouldn't mind all that much if they were asked to do even more.

 

Oh yes they would, the Aussies do not like you guys very much I'm afraid and the war opinion is going down in a hurry.
 
 
 
I think in military terms, UK is the closest ally as far as supporting the US. Hopefully this won't cost Blair too much. Australia comes second, then Canada.

Economically, Canada comes first, out biggest trading partner and closest neighbor. I would have placed Canada on the top of the list except for her position on Iraq. Other than that, she has stood solidly with the US every time.

I worry about Canada, partly because of what seems to me as a somewhat insane immigration policy. Canada seems to be going more and more to the multi-culturalism model of western europe. I don't want to see the same problems we see cropping up in places like the Netherlands happen to Canada. I think Canada's cultural identity is being watered down, and anti-American sentiment among the youth has a solid hold and is gaining ground.

I really don't trust Israel a bit. Too many times she has onsold US technology to countries that are not friendly to the US. Lavi and AWACS tech to China stands out in my mind. Israel cares only about Israel, and the US is forced to stick up for her because nobody else will. We dump billions of dollars, year after year, to countries like Egypt, just to buy a semi-peace for Israel, and I think Israel needs to put more effort into resolving the conflict in the region.

 

I live in the Netherlands at the moment and I must say that multi-cultuaralizm here is working very well. Muslims have integrated into society here very well better than anywhere else in the many mnay places I've been.

You mean the Average Joe Canada? He's an ignorant blinder wearing guy who naively believe that everybody on earth loves Canada and that soft power is the sole reason why Canada is so well respected on earth.

When confronted with the reality that Canada's position is bought by her military, they shiver into their nice little cubby hole screaming that Canada don't have soldiers, only peacekeepers.

Sad fact is that Canadians don't care about defence matters and no matter how much the NDP and the peace loving fuzzies wuzzies want to charge this up, Canadians don't care enough about BMD to bring down a government.

 

Care to define "Fuzzy wuzzies"? I was under the impression that it was a reference to blacks.

Just as the time honoured term 'nig' means 'just out of basic training' in the Royal Armoured Corps of the British army. People tried to link that with colour but failed.
 
 
Hmmm....obviously people won't like this, but I really fail to see any country that is truly allied with the US.

The UK is a political ally, but they don't need "saving" from the "commie" EU as the majority of their citizens are anti-war, as shown by huge demonstrations in London by thousands of joe-schmoes.

Americans think they're "in touch" with the average brit, but....they ain't.

Australia is a similar case, most of it's people are against the war.
The only reason they're there is due to trade agreements that bush dangled in front of Howard.

Who else plays an active part in the coalition?

Italy are withdrawing, Japan refuses to assault other nations, and well......who else is left?

Palau?
Morocco?
Macedonia?
Denmark?

I'm not saying the US has NO major allies, just very few.
 
 
I wrote an essay recently on the "SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP" between the US & UK (1945-73)

A read for those who want to go in detail.  
 
 
Although I posted a vote, this is one of those requirements to rate that are unrealistic.

The only entities of those presented that one could consider are the UK, Canada and Australia.

As pointed out before now, Isreal is and could only be interested in its own survival. That usually allignes it with the US but not always. Isreal has little to nothing to gain with regard to US interests in many other parts of the world ( ie outside of the middle-east ) and so cannot be considered relevant there as a ally.

Of the other three - I am Australian, my mother was English, my Father half Scottish and I have yet to meet ( matter of time having typed that! ) a Canadian that I did not like or feel comfortable with.

Each of those nations have provided support to the US but each in different ways, according to their abililties. Isn't that as it should be?

We have fought in probably more wars than any of the other since WW2 with the US. Even if I am off line there, who else joined the US in Vietnam? ( yeah I know, Thailand, South Korea and NZ ).

What the UK, Canada and Australia can, if I may put it ths way, offer to the US as allies is very different and that fact alone makes it difficult to rate the close allies of the US, notwithstanding the attitudes of their people.

Each of those three closest allies have at times taken contrary views to the US without, perhaps due to poliltical maturity and perhaps also due to diplomatic tact, there being any long term repercussions regarding the fundamental relationship between those countries.

I am not rying to exagerate my country's importance to the US, at least for most of post WW2. The UK and Canada were and remain absolutely vital parts of US defence and share core interests and values.

Any doubt as to the fighting quality of UK or Canadian troops has been utterly smashed in Afganistan.

We provide small expeditionary forces and battle to keep our part of the world quiet - which is getting harder with the failures of governance around the South Pacific. Plus, we have Indonesia and behind them Malaysia breathing down our necks.

So I find it hard to make a vote in this poll. Note bene the prior refenece in another post to Thailand, stout allies, excellent soldiers and the home of one of the world's truly great cuisines.

PS, in Australia, "fuzzie wuzzie" refers to those Papuan New Guineans who assisted out soldiers fighting the Japanese there and they are greatly respected by the average Australian - they principally assisted with the wounded etc.

The uk and usa, go hand in hand.
From miltry, diplomacy, technology, views and beleifes.
like a marragie, bound to be arguments, disagrrements and differences with your partner.
and times when a partner will do what they want regardless if you like it or not, but in the end a good marrige is that you still togeather in in the end.
[aint that right OoE]
e.g...
The only majour, mistake argument/non backing the yanks did with us, was the suez crises.
But at the end of the day we still, here and still working with each other

In the overal of things, not just on the battle field, I would put UK and Canada as the closest allies to the usa not necessarily for the same things.
There are stuff that canada excells and others that the uk does better.

Within the brit forces there is always a higher regard/respect for cnadian/Nz/ and austaralian personel then there is for
american ones. [reason which I aint going to get into now].

As of current on the battlefields of now.....I would have to disagree with what confed is harping on about with regards to the Aussies.
In afghan it is canada and Us [brits] that are spearheading operations. It is us that is takeing the full frontal assult and carnage
from the talibhan. It is us who are dying on the battlefields. Cause of bad American planning.
Iv met more canookss then aussies. They are professional, they listen, arnt brash, nor with a yeeha attitude.
And just get on with the job they are given, with what they have. just like the Brits....hats off to them.
 
 
South Korea should be on the list. After US and UN military forces suffered huge casualties saving South Korea from North Korean and Communist Chinese Occupation, South Korea has remained a strong ally of the USA. South Korea comitted military forces to Vietnam and now in Afghanistan and Iraq.

Culturally, Australia is the greatest ally of the USA.

In regards to intelligence and integration for joint operations the UK and Canada are the greatest allies of the USA.

Japan was forced to accept the USA or face annhilation after two nuclear bombs where dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Japan tolerates American military presence on Japanese territory because they fear what China and North Korea would do if the USA withrew all military forces from Japan.

So my order of strongest ten American allies is:

1. UK (most integrated, closest ally-intelligence, communications and military operations)
2. Australia (poltically closer to the USA than Canada is.)
3. Canada (integrated with NORAD)
4. South Korea (US Army still has wartime command of the South Korean Army)
5. El Salvador (US fought to ensure El Salvador could have democratic elections, El Salvador in America's stongest ally for all of Central and South America)
6. Germany (Army and Air Force Bases)
7. Japan (Marine, Navy and Air Force Bases)
8. Italy (Naples Naval Station, Aviano Air Base)
9. Spain (Rota Naval Station)
10. Poland (One of the few conservative countries left in Europe that actually likes the USA)
 
 
 
Well I certainly regret your short fuse and insistence that all opinions be those with which you can relate. Name calling and personal attack deprive your point of view of credibility -- just because other use humour which you do not find worthy is no reason to go off the handle.

Next thing you may want to go on a name calling and personal attack expedition against someone else - please don't do that to yourself.

 

Terek,

Discernment is discernment whether you are angered or not at that which you are discerning. Bluesman is merely a firebrand to say what he believes to be true. Laughing or frothing does not change the facts or ones interpretation of the facts. I think more red blooded American's ought to carry more fire in their hearts, and not believe all is well in their illusory sense of security within the borders of the USA.  

Bluesman is merely awake at the wheel. This is my hope for the rest of snoozing America.  

A little 'piss and vinegar' could not hurt us properly applied.  

Or maybe the men should all wear dresses and lisp?

This is not your call to make, and you only weaken yourself if you do. File the appropriate complaint outlined in the forum rules if you request an action to be taken.

Shaking things up is one thing, but do not go to the point of insulting our intelligence. Prior to 9/11, terrorists were born and bred in Pakistan, and sent to Afghanistan for training and these actions were condoned by your buddy Musharaff. After 9/11, the US gave him an olive branch to clean up his act, and his country. Even though Musharraf made the wise choice, hardly puts him in the running as a close ally under the circumstances. Musharraf has been rewarded for his efforts by the lifting of sanctions, money, and military equipment.

Bluesman has previously defended Pakistan in another post as to their cooperation in fighting terrorism in Pakistan.

With that being said, I think you two are adult enough to continue without the personal name calling, since it is unnecessary, and not a very good example to others here at WAB.  

 

Are you afraid of men expressing themselves?   Patton an MacArthur would not feel welcome here.   I assume that seems a bit cheesy to some of you, but when push comes to shove it will be MEN with fire in their bellies that save this country so we can actually have allies.   If you are with out a country there will be no need for allies.   Bluesman is a patriot and pissed off at the limp wrist appraisals of some so called allies and patriot's IMHO.

“Fuzzy-Wuzzy”

(Soudan Expeditionary Force)

Rudyard Kipling

WE’VE fought with many men acrost the seas,
An’ some of ’em was brave an’ some was not:
The Paythan an’ the Zulu an’ Burmese;
But the Fuzzy was the finest o’ the lot.
We never got a ha’porth’s change of ’im:
’E squatted in the scrub an’ ’ocked our ’orses,
’E cut our sentries up at Suakim,
An’ ’e played the cat an’ banjo with our forces.
So ’ere’s to you, Fuzzy-Wuzzy, at your ’ome in the Soudan;
You’re a pore benighted ’eathen but a first-class fightin’ man;
We gives you your certificate, an’ if you want it signed
We’ll come an’ ’ave a romp with you whenever you’re inclined.

We took our chanst among the Khyber ’ills,
The Boers knocked us silly at a mile,
The Burman give us Irriwaddy chills,
An’ a Zulu impi dished us up in style:
But all we ever got from such as they
Was pop to what the Fuzzy made us swaller;
We ’eld our bloomin’ own, the papers say,
But man for man the Fuzzy knocked us ’oller.
Then ’ere’s to you, Fuzzy-Wuzzy, an’ the missis and the kid;
Our orders was to break you, an’ of course we went an’ did.
We sloshed you with Martinis, an’ it wasn’t ’ardly fair;
But for all the odds agin’ you, Fuzzy-Wuz, you broke the square.

’E ’asn’t got no papers of ’is own,
’E ’asn’t got no medals nor rewards,
So we must certify the skill ’e’s shown
In usin’ of ’is long two-’anded swords:
When ’e’s ’oppin’ in an’ out among the bush
With ’is coffin-’eaded shield an’ shovel-spear,
An ’appy day with Fuzzy on the rush
Will last an ’ealthy Tommy for a year.
So ’ere’s to you, Fuzzy-Wuzzy, an’ your friends which are no more,
If we ’adn’t lost some messmates we would ’elp you to deplore;
But give an’ take’s the gospel, an’ we’ll call the bargain fair,
For if you ’ave lost more than us, you crumpled up the square!

’E rushes at the smoke when we let drive,
An’, before we know, ’e’s ’ackin’ at our ’ead;
’E’s all ’ot sand an’ ginger when alive,
An’ ’e’s generally shammin’ when ’e’s dead.
’E’s a daisy, ’e’s a ducky, ’e’s a lamb!
’E’s a injia-rubber idiot on the spree,
’E’s the on’y thing that doesn’t give a damn
For a Regiment o’ British Infantree!
So ’ere’s to you, Fuzzy-Wuzzy, at your ’ome in the Soudan;
You’re a pore benighted ’eathen but a first-class fightin’ man;
An’ ’ere’s to you, Fuzzy-Wuzzy, with your ’ayrick ’ead of ’air—
You big black boundin’ beggar—for you broke a British square!

 

The meaning is at your discretion!  

Today, I believe the Gollywog or Golliwog is taken to be a racial thing!

I think that even in the Noddy series the Gollywog has changed into something else!
 
 
Sir,

In the CF, the term Fuzzy-Wuzzy means absolute confusion.
 
 
Good thread. Nice dust up.

Who is America's Closest Ally?

England is our Mother country. Canada is our neighbor.

Who would you be closest to? Who shares your values?

Family.
 
 
 
Sir,

In the CF, the term Fuzzy-Wuzzy means absolute confusion.

 

Well, Fuzzy means not clear in ideas.

Fuzzy wuzzy is also a derogatory term (a slang) for coloured natives from other countries as per the The Concise Oxford Dictionary.

The English having been an imperialist power and thus interacting with various races as rulers or as opposing combatants did develop the interesting nicknames for those they interacted with like wog, frog, kraut, dago, spic, yid, coon, ******, Argie.

Unless one uses it as a deluberate abuse, I think one should overlook such indiscretions.

I am sure other languages too would have such 'quirks'; maybe not with such a wide choice!

English is after all a very versatile language, as I have always held.

For "absolute confusion", would "buggers muddle" not be more appropriate?

I believe, the American equivalent is "Clusterfvck".

Does indicate the attitudinal veering of various categories of people!

Fuzzy Wuzzy was a bear,

Fuzzy Wuzzy has no hair,

Fuzzy Wuzzy turns out the light,

Fuzzy Wuzzy says good night,

A ryhme from my childhood. I never knew what it ment. I don't think it had a meaning. I wonder if its origin is extrapolated from the poem you posted?  

IVAN
 
 
That poem is a famous one by the famed Rudyard Kipling.

Rudyard Kipling is known for some quotes which have become history.

When you're wounded and left on Afghanistan's plains, and the women come out to cut up what remains, jest roll to your rifle and blow out your brains and go to your gawd like a soldier.

If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew to serve your turn long after they are gone, and so hold on when there is nothing in you except the will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

The first condition of understanding a foreign country is to smell it.

I have struck a city - a real city - and they call it Chicago... I urgently desire never to see it again. It is inhabited by savages.

You're a better man than I am, Gunga Din!

If you can keep your wits about you while all others are losing theirs, and blaming you.... The world will be yours and everything in it, what's more, you'll be a man, my son.

If you can keep your wits about you while all others are losing theirs, and blaming you.... The world will be yours and everything in it, what's more, you'll be a man, my son.

If you can keep your wits about you while all others are losing theirs, and blaming you.... The world will be yours and everything in it, what's more, you'll be a man, my son.

If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster/ And treat those two impostors just the same.

We have forty million reasons for failure, but not a single excuse.

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, / Or walk with kings - nor lose the common touch.

Of all the liars in the world, sometimes the worst are your own fears

I keep six honest serving men: They taught me all I knew: Their names are What and Why and When and How and Where and Who

Our England is a garden, and such gardens are not made By singing - 'Oh how beautiful!' and sitting in the shade, While better men than we go out and start their working lives At grubbing weeds from gravel paths with broken dinner knives

Oh, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet

Take up the White man's burden --
Send forth the best ye breed --
Go bind your sons to exile
To serve your captives' need;
To wait in heavy harness
On fluttered folk and wild --
Your new-caught, sullen peoples,
Half devil and half child.
 
 
Brokensickle,

You must read Kipling's "IF".

When I was a Cadet in our National Defence Academy, over our study table this poem was framed and we all had to learn it by heart!

It is fantastic poem and meant for all!

Have you read his book on Mowgli, the Jungle Boy?

Great again!

If you judge Kipling by contemporary standards, he is surely a racist. But, if you judge him by the ethics of those times, he sure had a heart and respect (as much as was possible without upsetting the dictates and ethos of the Raj) for all natives. He was born in India and was brought up by his maid servant and was what is termed as babalog

I, for one, judge these "Koi Hais" based on the realities of the those times and not by contemporary times. One has to be fair.

I like his works.

As usual I didn't make it before the poll closed   I would have to put Canada first and the UK and Australia tied for second.I will admit that my view is prejudiced towards Canada because of lifelong exposure on a daily basis due to where I live.Michigan and Canada are integrated to the point where there might as well not be a border.Anyone traveling to the Upper Penninsula of Michigan would think they were in Canada if you went strictly by dialect(Goin' oot and aboot eh?)   Those of you that have mentioned France and their contributions to the Revolutionary War should not forget that they were still smarting from losing the French and Indian War to the British along with their territorial gains in what is now the continental U.S.   And our wonderful future allies also encouraged their Native American allies to destroy outlying British settlers whenever possible(Colonial terrorism-murder,rape and torture),and yet a few short years later they came to us as saviors,willing to help us poor colonials throw off the yoke of England's oppression.This is not to downplay their contributions or efforts,but make no mistake about it,they had many political considerations in mind when they assisted us.

Dude I don't get Hockey Night in Canada here in southern California. I wish I did. Plus the fact that Celine Dion now resides in Las Vegas, which is just a few hours of drive away from me, make the choice quite obvious.

Who do you favor in the east in this playoff? Ducks just might have the talent to make it to the cup finals again.
 
 
Awww jeez....I actually like the Sabres in the East   In the West it will be interesting as..if Dallas wins then they play the Red Wings and the Ducks will play the Sharks,if the Canucks win then the Wings play the Sharks and the Ducks will play the Canucks.My prediction-The Red Wings over the Sabres 4-3 for the Stanley Cup  
 
 
 
Sir,

In the CF, the term Fuzzy-Wuzzy means absolute confusion.

 

It seems that the CF have got closest as according to the Oxford English Dictionary the first mention in print of the word fuzzy was in 1616 when it meant 'Spongy, not firm or sound in substance'. By 1664 the meaning had changed to 'Frayed into loose fibres'. By 1778 it meant 'Blurred, indistinct of thought, etc, imprecisely defined, vague'; also in persons 'inexact of thought or expression'. Of hair, frizzy fluffy'. The most modern of its meanings includes 'fuzzy logic' in computing.
The word 'wuzzy' on its own is as recent as 1896 and its definition is given as 'confused, fuddled, vague'.
The term Fuzzy Wuzzy was coined by British soldiers referring to the Sudanese natives elaborate hair styles. Rudyard Kipling (never a racist) wrote his poem as a salute to their bravery. The soldiers humour came up with the name, and it was not derogatory, just a term for their enemy in the field. As one of Kiplings soldier characters says in another poem "I'd just as soon as not, respect the man I fight". As the Sudan contains 600 ethnic groups with over 400 languages and dialects, I dread to think what the mealy-mouthed Politically Correct brigade would have had us call them if they had been around at the time!
 
 
In deference to my friends, I will be politically correct on this issue. It is more so since I have friends on this forum whose sensitivity I do not want to upset. I do care for their feelings.

Let us look at this academically and without vectoring to nationalities. After all, no one/ country/ race is lilly white. I am sure there will be no disagreement on this.

Fuzzy, indeed, means not clear etc. But similarity with "fuzzy wuzzy"?

My Oxford Dictionaries (two of them) do not contain the word 'wuzzy', neither googling has helped and so let us agree for discussion that 'wuzzy' is what it has been stated.

My German dictionary states that "dumm" means "stupid" and "kopf" means "head". However, it goes on to state that "Dummkopf" means "an idiot".

In other words, what I am trying to bring forth is that individually in stand alone mode, any word can mean one thing, but used with another word it has a totally different meaning. The words "fuzzy" and "wuzzy' when used together means "Sudanese soldier, (sl) coloured natives of other countries". That is the meaning as given by the Oxford Dictionary. Googling goes further to state "A derogatory term for a black person, especially one with fuzzy hair".

Ruyard Kipling is a writer and a poet who I deeply admire and enjoy reading. He was born in India and he did love the natives, possibly more than what was acceptable. Yet, to be fair to him, he was not beyond the concept of the "Master Race' syndrome which was a natural affliction of those times of the British Raj. In fact, Kipling was fond of India so much so Kipling's books always had the Hindu Swastika (different from the Nazi Swatika) on its cover till Hitler rose to power! Hindus, normally, put the Hindu Swastika at the beginning of anything auspicious!

This "Master Race" syndrome afflicted all Colonial Powers and so one cannot say that the British alone had this affliction. It was the flavour of the times, so to say and that is why Hitler could propound with impunity this theory without much opposition.

I have the fondest regards for the British for a variety of reason that are personal. What upset me was the claim that naturalised citizens of Britain like Bangladeshis, Paksitanis and Indians do not qualify as being "Britons". I checked the Oxford Dictionary and it stated that a Briton was "native or inhabitant of Great Britain". And the rational as to why the Indians, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis did not qualify as Briton and why the English, Scot and Welsh alone could, was not clarified!  

I will not hesitate to say that it caused me great anguish that such exclusion could be made. It is extraordinary that a military man failed to remember that Johnson Gideon Beharry VC (born 26 July 1979, in Grenada), of the 1st Battalion, Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment is a British soldier who, on 18 March 2005, was awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest military decoration for valour in the British and Commonwealth armed forces, for twice saving members of his unit from ambushes on 1 May and 11 June 2004 at Al-Amarah, Iraq. He sustained serious head injuries in the latter engagement. Beharry was formally invested with the Victoria Cross by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on 27 April 2005.Beharry is the first recipient of the Victoria Cross since the posthumous awards to Lieutenant Colonel H. Jones and Sergeant Ian John McKay for service in the Falklands War in 1982. He is the first living recipient of the VC since Keith Payne and Rayene Stewart Simpson, both Australian, for actions in Vietnam in 1969, and the first living recipient of the VC in the British Army since Rambahadur Limbu, a Gurkha, in the Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation in 1965. As of 26 June 2006, he is one of only 12 living recipients of the VC, and the youngest.

Beharry was born in Grenada. He moved to the UK in 1999.

Is Private Beharry not a Briton?

I understand as to why Kipling wrote that the natives were "the White Man's Burden" (and on that he was mistaken but I will give it a pass).

However, I cannot understand as to why Beharry who displayed courage beyond the call of duty for the Crown and Britain, is not a Briton, if indeed it means, as per the Oxford Dictionary, "native or inhabitant of Great Britain"

Once again, my friends from the UK, I have the fondness and regards for you all, but I am sure you, too, as true Britons would appreciate that I have the same fire in my loins as the English to give my Indian version of 'Cry God for Harry, England, and Saint George!'

If I did otherwise, I would not have benefited form the British public school teaching of insisting and batting for fairplay and justice!

Once again, I am looking at the issue from a academic point of view and beyond nationalities.

“It is natural for man to indulge in the illusions of hope. We are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth, and listen to the song of that siren till she transforms us into beasts... For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost, I am willing to know the whole truth, to know the worst, and to provide for it.”

Ray,

Good post! You were to the point on that post.

All of mankind has a disposition to err. All we need do is draw close to the creator as He draws us to Himself and leave the details to God. Prejudice is a fear of the unknown. Perfect love cast out all fear, save the proper fear of our Awesome Creator, Saviour, and God. If we fear no man, we will be able to realize the folly of our prejudice.

Patrick Henry is my favorite patriot and orator of America's long list of Statesmen...He made it a practice to say as much as he could using as few words as possible. His speaking was fiery, laser focused and cut to the bone but with such an ingratiating eloquence and wit even his detractors were compelled to contemplation and reconsideration.

Brokensickle,

The last post of mine is the same as the earlier ones, except that it was like a mathematical statement. A = B, B = C and therefore A = C.

Also, the preface that I was being PC did attract a better attention span,

Once again, I will say that all my posts in the forum on Britain has always been more than fair to Britain. It is only when I find illogical unfairness that I find it hard to swallow, let alone digest!

May I also draw your attention that there has been many an occasion where I have not hesitated to comment on the negative aspects of my country too! I am not a jingo. All that I seek is logic within the maze of prejudices of mankind. Fairness will follow logic.

Illogical and unfairness gets my back up. I have been brought up so as a child and also in school. Therefore, to change at this age for the sake of being nice is a bit difficult.

There is a famous saying of the Indian Nobel Laureate, Rabindranath Tagore.
Paraphrasing it goes something like this:

You can be nice even to your enemy - thorough the lack of character!

Thank you for re-producing Patrick Henry's quote that I used in my last post.

Patrick Henry inspires me with some of his sayings. My knowing about Henry was from the time I was a child, note: a child and not a boy! Very young. I saw a children's film where there was some lost child and his custody or something like that. The lawyer or father quoted Patrick Henry's famous, "Give me Liberty or Give me Death!" I have forgotten the name of the film, but not these words. It has inspired me every time I faced injustice!

Therefore, even on this Forum, when I had joined I faced being banned because of my views on Bush and the Iraq War. I was ready - I would not have felt bad if I had been Banned because I would not like to hang on through a lack of character by giving away my Liberty and Free Speech. May I also say that in my posts then I was not once offensive, merely logical. I give it to Ironman that he saw that there was no real reason to ban except that I was not subscribing to the popular view!

Generals have not been able to shake my belief in Truth and Justice. I daresay, anything will!

Not that I don't blame you for cheering for your wings, but I just don't see them beating the Sabres or the Sens for that matter, both have far too much scoring talent for the wings to bottle up with their fairly decent defence.

So the Brits are sacrificing and actually doing the heavy lifting in the War on Terror right alongside of us - but the grumble and ***** the whole way. Aussies aren't making as much of a contribution, but I have a sense they don't resent what they are doing, and wouldn't mind all that much if they were asked to do even more.

 

Hi Bluesman, please don't take this the wrong way but I would have thought being out there in significant numbers dying and fighting every day alongside American troops was proof enough.

We don't actually have to like being there do we?

What I really don't understand is those who see Israel (the state and NOT the people) as an "ally?" I would have thought Israels ties to the U.S. were more to do with the huge Jewish lobby that argues and pushes for funds to Israel. I don't think Canada, U.K. or Australia get anything back financially from the States. (I know the U.K. benefitted hugely from Lend Lease during WW2)

Being an ally to the richest and most powerful nation has its problems - financial indebtedness (apart from Australia - AU$00000 foreign or government debt owed I believe?) means that all the U.S. relationships with all its allies has far more to it than meets the eye.
 
 
Bluesman,

One has to also see the numbers one is deploying.

The UK has deployed more than others (except US) and so the probability of getting killed is greater. Hence, the intent to seriously pursue the Iraq War should not be taken lightly.

One could deploy less but be high on rhetoric.

I think having boots on the ground is more important that aggressive public support.

It is not that Australia and others are not doing their bit. They are.

Yet, it does not mean that the UK has not done more than her share also!
 
 
I realize people say "well we give Israel money so of course they are our friend" but if you polled people on the street in all the above mentioned countries you'd get probably a 95% favorable rating in Israel no matter what the US is into. In Israel they think Bush is not the brightest bulb in the box but they still support the US.

I don't think you'd get that level of support in other countries. Israel is never critical of America.
 
 
Political compulsion and survival necessity dictates foreign policy as also public statements.

I am sure with the support that the US has given Israel, there should be no grounds for Israel to complain!
 
 
 
I don't think you'd get that level of support in other countries. Israel is never critical of America.

 

Druze, please don't think I'm anti Israeli people here but to me there's a BIG difference in an ally that is prepared to stand shoulder to shoulder in battle (even if we complain because we're not all convinced of the reasons for the war) and in real numbers than being an ally who really really likes you.

While there may be problems if Israel deployed troops alongside the U.S. and U.K. in the ME, it shouldn't stop them doing so in other parts of the world.

As Ray puts it - "having boots on the ground is more important that aggressive public support."

Surely you know enough about the political situation that bars Israel from fighting alongside American troops. Israel has time and again offered its full support to the US. The problem is as was in Desert Storm, Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, is that the First condition to allowing US forces to use those muslim nations as bases is that under no circumstances can Israel be involved

Israel would help the US every time the US asked if it were possible. But obviously Israel can't station 50,000 troops in Pakistan to help in Afghanistan or 50,000 troops in Saudi Arabia to invade Iraq.

You really think Israel refuses to help the US physically by its own accord?

Remember 1991? Israel had Scud missiles launched at it and didn't respond at the US's request. Knowing Israel, you know that Israel doesn't take to kindly to having its nation bombed by another country. How many countries would allow themselves to be bombed and not retaliate at the request of the US?

And if the United States decides to stop being so PC, Israel can put a hell of alot more boots, tanks, and APC's on the ground as well as much more jets in the air then any other close US ally.
 
 
Druze,

I am sure Israel can put boots on the ground for the US and it is true that Israel cannot be asked to assist in Moslem countries for obvious reason.

There is also another reason why Israel is possibly not asked to assist. if Israel puts 50,000 boots on the ground for the US, then Israel will herself get exposed and play into the hands of the Arabs, who will then attack. Who will be there to defend?

I think if Israel remains a threat in being to the Arabs, it in itself is a great help.

Arabs are just waiting in the wings to Israel weakens itself.

Israel can activate some reserves for a specific mission. Also Israel has no major threat bordering it anymore. Israel can withstand three entire Syrian divisions with its airforce.

Also Israel sending 50,000 troops to help out in Iraq you have to remember that Israel isn't exactly 3,000 miles away from Iraq. Its around the corner. They could drive back to defend Israel if needed.

Israel has over 4,500 tanks, 550 combat jets, 130,000 Active troops and about 600,000 reserves. They also have one of the largest field artillery capacities of any nation. It is arguably the world's third or fourth most powerful nation. And minus nuclear weapons they are probably the third most powerful army.
 
 
There is no question that Israel is more than capable of supporting the US. However, the willingness is another matter altogether. I would've loved to see Israeli soldiers in Yugoslavia, East Timor, Rwanda, just about any place where blue berets are wanted.
 
 
Druze,

War is not a video game.

One must understand the Principle of War - Selection and Maintenance of Aim. You cannot switch as if it were pushing a button to light a bulb and then pushing it again to switch it off.

Also slot the following Principles of War:

Britain and the Commonwealth armies uses 10 principles of war.

Selection and Maintenance of the Aim
Define the end state and ensure that all strategy is directed toward achieving it.

Concentration of Force
Make the best use of military power to achieve the commander's aims by overwhelming the enemy's military capacity.

Economy of Effort
Make efficient use of forces, conserving energy and materiel to prevent unnecessary depletion. Or over ensuring.

Maintenance of Morale
Prevent one's own forces from losing the will to fight.

Offensive Action
Maintain operational tempo by attacking the enemy.

Flexibility
Be able to respond to unexpected changes or attacks and be able to modify one's plans accordingly.

Co-Operation
Ensure that the maritime, land and air components work in unison to achieve the end state.

Security
Prevent the enemy from benefiting from lapses in [operational security at all stages of the military process.

Surprise
Seize the initiative by attacking the enemy when, where and how he least expects it.

Sustainability
Support, fuel and guide forces to maintain operational capability.

Are you aware of the Logistics maze that is required to move troops or even switching troops from one axis to another? Do a staff check. Moving 50,000 or even only a Brigade with combat support and combat service support elements is not as easy as it appears on a forum.

Rumsfeld maybe blamed for sending in a smaller force than what some feel would be required. People forget that it had to be organised and executed before international pressure could build up. And even moving that was a huge logistic nightmare.

Read "The Lifeblood of War (Logistics in Armed Conflict)" authored by Thompson (Brassey Publications).
 
 
 
Should be Canada, is UK by a landslide.

 

Not necessarily.. There is some feeling by Canadians that the US tends to believe that her interests (American) interests should be Canadian interests....
 
 
Shouldn't South Korea also be up there? Granted they aren't THE closest, but they still are a commendable ally.

Druze, what Israel did was truly admirable under the circumstances. I think I was saying exactly the same thing as you regarding the Muslim reaction if Israel had forces on the ground in any ME conflict (but thank you for saying it far more eloquently!)

 
And if the United States decides to stop being so PC, Israel can put a hell of alot more boots, tanks, and APC's on the ground as well as much more jets in the air then any other close US ally.

 

If we're now talking about other theatres of operation (i.e. outside Muslim influence) then I fail to see how Israel might have been put off by U.S. request alone in U.N. operations as listed by Officer of Engineers.

Truth of the matter is whoever is seen as the U.S. closest ally, what does that really mean at the end of the day? We are all merely vassal states to the most powerful Nation (currently) in the world and how much can the leaders of Canada, Australia or the U.K really influence U.S. policy?

To me an ally is more than a "yes-man" (in terms of Nations relating to each other). The thread laughed at suggestions it may be France (check the title out for poll options) and I'd put Germany in there alongside France - they probably have more say over how the U.S. makes foreign policy (by their "refusnik" and obstructionist stance on most things) than those Nations who step side by side with the U.S.
 
 
Drize,

Friends that we may be of Israel.

And I have close relatives who are Jews (as Ira knows).

But it will not cloak my appraisal of the events. I would also not be satisfied even with my country not coming up to the mark.

It is only a friend who can be critical, because he cares!

It is time to pull up the socks and there can be no sugar coating about that!

I am sure you will understand.
