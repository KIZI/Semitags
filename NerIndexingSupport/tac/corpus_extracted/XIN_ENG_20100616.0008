The legislative body of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) called on all members of
the seven- strong federation to contribute fairly to the federal budget instead
of placing the burden on Abu Dhabi and Dubai, local English daily The National
reported Wednesday.

The call came as Obaid Humaid al Tayer, minister of state for financial affairs,
defended the Finance Ministry against allegations of members of the Federal
National Council (FNC) that its policies may have led to spending shortfalls
that halted vital programs, The National said.

A report by the FNC's finance, economy and industry committee said the ministry
should assert its role in collecting federal revenues, improve its services to
other ministries and strengthen its role in monitoring public spending,
including prosecuting perpetrators of financial irregularities.

"The FNC urges the Cabinet of Ministers to ask all emirates to contribute to the
federal budget," the report was quoted as saying.

Contributions by the other emirates would serve as a "sign of unity" and
"highlight their solidarity in carrying the burden of the budget and carrying
out their responsibilities," it said.

The committee was asked last year to draft a report analyzing the plans and
performance of the Finance Ministry, which oversees federal spending.

According to The National, the UAE's federal budget this year stands at 43.6
billion dirhams (about 11.9 billion U.S. dollars), of which Abu Dhabi
contributes about 17 billion dirhams and Dubai 1.2 billion dirhams.

The remainder comes from money earned by federal departments rather than the
other emirates, the newspaper said.

The UAE, which has the world's sixth largest oil reserves, comprises seven
emirates, namely Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm al-Quwain, Ras al-Khaimah
and Fujairah.

Abu Dhabi, the biggest and richest in the federation, is the main contributor to
the country's federal budget, while Dubai is the most populous and its main
revenues are from tourism, real estate and financial services.

Under the constitution, all the emirates must contribute a fixed percentage of
their annual revenues towards the federal budget.
