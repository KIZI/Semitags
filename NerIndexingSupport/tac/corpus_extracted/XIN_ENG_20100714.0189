Syria on Wednesday circulated a letter to the UN Security Council, raising
concerns over the UN's role with Syrian-Lebanese relations, citing their
continued attempt to "interfere" in the heels of the newest report on the
region.

The letter, which was delivered by Syrian UN ambassador Bashar Ja'afari and
dated July 7, comes in response to UN Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon's latest
report, which called upon Syria to " cooperate" with such efforts with Lebanon
to dismantle the Palestinian military bases that "straddle" the border of the
two regions.

Ban's report "continues the attempt to interfere in the development of Syrian-
Lebanese relations," said the letter, taking note that "continued interference"
in the countries'bilateral relations would be "reprehensible."

Syria and Lebanon "alone have the right to assess the state of those relations,"
the letter said, which was addressed to Ban and to the current president of the
Security Council, Uche Joy Ogwu, the Nigerian UN ambassador who holds the
rotating Council presidency for July.

"The Syrian Arab Republic reiterates that the question of Palestinian positions
inside Lebanon is a bilateral issue that concerns the Palestinians and Lebanese
alone," the letter said.

"The Syrian Arab Republic has nothing to do with the matter," said the letter,
reiterating the "competence" of the Lebanese government.

The letter further emphasized that the role of the United Nations should be to
create "conditions that are conducive to positive relations between states."

In his report to the Security Council, which was released here on Tuesday, Ban
said that not enough progress has been made by Israel and Lebanon on key
obligations under the Security Council resolution that ended the hostilities of
2006.

He noted with "concern" of the military bases in Lebanon, as well as the "threat
that they pose to Lebanon's sovereignty."

"The military bases are beyond the control of the state and, with the exception
of Naame, near Beirut, straddle the border between Lebanon and the Syrian Arab
Republic, posing an added challenge to Lebanon's control of the border," Ban
said in his report.

According to Lebanese officials, the cooperation of the Syrian government in the
efforts to dismantle the bases is "still nascent and requires further
development," Ban said in his report.

"I am confident that progress will be made in this respect in coming months,"
Ban said.

Earlier on Wednesday, the Security Council met behind closed doors to discuss
Ban's report.

Emerging from the consultations, UN special coordinator for Lebanon Michael
Williams said the UN welcomes the "highly significant" relations between Lebanon
and Syria.
