Chinese shares closed down 0.59 percent on Monday due to profit-taking and share
oversupply concerns after a dozen small-sized companies announced flotation
plans, dealers said.

The Shanghai Composite Index, which covers both A and B shares, lost 17.23
points to 2,894.48 on turnover of 100 billion yuan (14.6 billion dollars).

"The supply pressure coming from a wave of fundraising is quite heavy, despite
the increasing demand from institutional investors," Chen Huiqin, an analyst at
Huatai Securities, told Dow Jones Newswires.

More than a dozen small- and medium-sized companies said Monday that regulators
had approved their plans to launch IPOs ahead of listings on a Nasdaq-style
board in Shenzhen later this month.

"The large number of Growth Enterprise Board listings is placing psychological
pressure on the market," Chen said.

Banks were among the best performers earlier Monday following Huijin's
announcement that it had increased stakes in Industrial and Commercial Bank of
China, China Construction Bank and Bank of China.

However, some of them were hit late in the session as short-term investors
booked gains, traders said.

ICBC ended up 0.4 percent at 4.96 yuan after rising as high as 5.09 yuan. Bank
of China ended down 0.3 percent at 3.99 yuan after peaking at 4.09 yuan earlier
in the day.

China Construction Bank ended flat Monday at 5.80 yuan after rising as high as
6.00 yuan.

Chongqing Changan Automobile rose 4.6 percent to 11.13 yuan after reporting over
the weekend that its September car sales nearly doubled to 132,030 units from
68,140 units a year earlier.

The Shanghai A-share index fell 18.11 points, or 0.59 percent, to 3,037.59 on
turnover of 99.7 billion yuan, while the Shenzhen A-share index gained 1.54
points, or 0.15 percent, to 1,048.57 on turnover of 55.4 billion yuan.

The Shanghai B-share index was down 0.78 points, or 0.39 percent, to 199.61,
while the Shenzhen B-share index shed 0.33 points, or 0.06 percent, at 519.67.
