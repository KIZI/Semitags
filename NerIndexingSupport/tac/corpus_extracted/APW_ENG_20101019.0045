Levi Johnston says there are really no qualifications to hold the job that Sarah Palin once held -- that of mayor of Wasilla, Alaska.

Johnston, the father of Palin's grandson, was grilled on "The View" Monday about his mayoral ambitions.

In August, Johnston's manager confirmed Johnston's plans to run for the office as part of a reality TV show and insisted he was serious about it.

Johnston said the only real qualification is to live in the city limits for a year before the election. He believes he's as qualified as any other candidate, saying he believes it's important to listen to the people and their concerns.

Johnston said he has no platform, which drew groans from the round-table.
