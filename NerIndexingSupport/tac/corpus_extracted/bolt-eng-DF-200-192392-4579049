 
 
coolest city in the world
 
 
NY, london, barcelona etc..
which city is the coolest of em all?
 
 
HAVANA
 
 
London isn't cool, it's ****.
 
 
san francisco is awesome
 
 
London and Tokyo!
 
 
Barca is reasonably cool, of those i've visited.

The one I imagine the coolest but haven't been to is probably Vancouver. Have never spoken to anyone who's been out there and not had a good time. Diverse, interesting and wicked cool scenery.
 
 
Moscow or St Petersburg
 
 
Barca is **** - theres just old churches and strip clubs everywhere
 
 
But probably Hong Kong or New York for me
 
 
Basra.
 
 
NYC.
 
 
Reykjavik and Kathmandu
 
 
 
But probably Hong Kong or New York for me

 

Hong Kong sucks, what a stressful city !!!!  
i cant even take a break
 
 
Samsun
 
 
San Francisco is pretty cool.

But of the cities you listed I'd struggle to split New York and London.
 
 
 
Hong Kong sucks, what a stressful city !!!!  
i cant even take a break

 

Coolest city, not the most relaxing.
 
 
Reykjavik or Bergen, out of the ones I've been to.

I've heard Vancouver, Auckland, and Honolulu are meant to be pretty cool.
 
 
Seattle
 
 
Hong Kong or Singapore.
These two are just so much fun to be in. The food, the people, the nightlife.. oh my gosh, I want to go back!  
 
 
Oymyakon, Russia - average winter temperature is -71.2Â°C! Brrrrrr-iliiant!!!  
 
 
San Francisco is freaking awesome. I liked it even better than New York when I went to America suprisingly. Its really good for people who have a slight hippy nature. Although weirdly enough there are ALOT of religious nuts screaming on the street. Moreso than New York even.
 
 
Dubai
