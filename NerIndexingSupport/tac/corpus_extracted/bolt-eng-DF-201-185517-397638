Question for the European posters.

If I were to walk in to say, a pub or any local place where people chat, and the topic of the 9/11 attacks were brought up, what would be the odds of a conspiracy theorist telling me of a 9/11 conspiracy "revelation" i.e. the U.S. military fired a missile at the pentagon! (a European truther favorite)? Since you know a lot about 9/11, do you have anyone trying to tell you "what really happened"?

Just trying to get a sense of how these memes have infected other countries.

TIA.

ETA: Follow-up question: And how would people react to the "revelations" this conspiracy theorist is so anxious to reveal?
 
 
Asking people if they 100% believe the official story (i.e. subscribe to the JREF asshat stance), i would say 15% would say yes. 70% percent would say that they hide something, and 15% would say something along the line of 9/11 being an inside job. This is in urban Germany and of course my experience/guesstimate.
 
 
CLE's got a point. At the end of a column by a Spiegel editor, he mentions something that makes it sound like 9/11 conspiracy theorizing is common at least on the political left in Germany:

 
The conversation quickly turned to the last Michael Moore film, and our friend suddenly claimed that the film could not be shown throughout the entire Midwest of the United States. He made it sound as if Moore were some French auteur filmmaker who was finally holding up a mirror to the Americans, which they couldn't abide.

I had a pretty clear idea of how the conversation would continue, and I knew that I would be upset with myself afterwards, once again, because I hadn't challenged him decisively enough. "To make it brief, because we'll get to this point anyway," I heard myself saying: " No, I don't believe that the CIA was behind the Sept. 11 attacks, and yes, we liked living in America." He was quiet, we drank our tea, and the two said their goodbyes before long. I was shocked by what I had said, but also a little proud of myself.

Granted, that's just one single throwaway sentence on one single element of conspiracy fantasy. On top of that, it's just one man's statement. But still, the context of the column is his emigration from the political left. Saying what he said indicates that such a myth is commonly held among among Germans of that political stripe. CLE here could probably expand on that to a much greater degree than me.

Thank you for your insights Childlike Empress. (seriously)
 
 
@ Childlike Empress:
When did you first start to doubt the "official story" and what was it that broke the persuasive threshold? Was it an Internet video or was it how the German media portrayed 9/11 and the U.S. investigations? I know you're not interested in any "alternative theories" (which is common in trutherdom nowadays) but when did the meme ' "they" are hiding something ' first spring up? Year and month if applicable.
 
 
 
blah.

i think its a lil foolish to call everyone here an asshat
i always say there's some doubt based on some of the reports of evidence not being followed up on prior to 911 to possibly allow for "conspiracy"

but since supernano laser thermite missiles seem to be the big story no one looks at the little more plausible ones (or ones that are very hard to disprove)

100% of FDNY and NYPD i know would respond less than pleasant (physically) if you walked up to them off duty and tried to tell them they were liars and shills
 
 
SPIEGEL, the leading weekly in Gemany (rightfully so up to short to the new millenium, dubbed the "former news magazine" after it), did the ultimative "hit-piece" on the second anniversary of 9/11 - when geman 9/11 skepticism peaked. I was following the reporting of Mathias Br√∂ckers starting a day after the event and i had the gepolitical background to understand what he was writing.

ummm...since when is believing 100% of the official account of 9/11 the JREF stance?

I for one do not believe we were told the entire truth about 9/11. I think a large proportion of those calling themselves debunkers here, feel the same way.

i voted against bush twice
i think he and his crew should answer charges that we invaded Iraq based on some real ***y intel (or plain old lies)
then going in with only enough troops for a front line push and not enough in the rear to guard assets (that later became IEDs)

BASED ON THAT ALONE AND HOW BAD THEY ***ED IRAQ UP
HOWWWWWWWWWWW COULD THEY PULL OFF 911 AND NOT GET CAUGHT???

yemen should have been next
and then go some payback for "blackhawk down"

I'm french and, excepted some paranoid crook, nobody cares about 9/11. The main majority accepts that two planes crashed into the Twin Towers, causing their destruction, and another plane crashed into the Pentagon. Sometimes, there are TV shows or radio programs or some websites that deal with it, and they are litterally flooded with twoofers' complaints.

But Thierry Meyssan has done a lot of harm with his crazy theories, because french people tend to distrust american governments. If this tragical event is brought into a discussion, people will think that "maybe "they"'re hiding something".

So trutherism isn't popular in France? Because if there's one place it would be popular, it's definitely France.

Actually, I know Sarkozy is pro-American and wouldn't tolerate something as stupid as 911 truth. The Parliment...I'm not so sure..........

It's as popular as the American Twoof Movements: they exist only on the Internet, they're trying to make proselytism whenever it is possible, but their range of nuisance is very limited IRL. And at least, they don't wear "9/11 truth" t-shirts.
We also have some celebrities believing in Da Twoof, but once they said what they are thinking about this event, they are quickly doomed by everybody, people begin to distrust them and they fall into a complete disgrace. We also have a minister who might believe truthers are correct, because "it's written on the Internet".

But there are more and more conspiracist freaks who are also rising IRL. They regrouped themselves into an anti-Zionist, almost anti-semitic,  political party  which mixes black supremacists, far-right-wingers, far-left-wingers. "Enemies' enemies are our friends." They take the 9/11 as a part of a global conspiracy organized by the USA and Israel.
 
 
You walk into a bar in my country and start asking about stuff like 911 CT's and no-one will have any idea what you are talking about.

Away from the net, in real life, there is no chat about it.
 
 
the older the people are, the less informed they are. The reason is, that they have no internet-connection.
Concerning the Pentagon-Attack, I do not think, it was hit by a missile. There are just too many witnesses, which report from a big airplane. Unfortunately, loose change has brought many people on the wrong track - after my judgment. Most European "truthers", do not follow my judgment.

More or less the same here, I think. When the 'movement' was in its infancy and still seemed to have something worth saying, then there was a degree of interest (although with a great deal of eye-rolling at the CTists), but now, when the contortions entered into by twoofers to maintain their theories are so laughable, we seem largely to have lost patience with it.

Echoed that. But you rarely find people outside the internet claiming a missile hit the Pentagon. Personally, I never met a truther in real life who claimed this. But it¬¥s a German CT classic, though, probably since German CT pioneers Wisnewski and von B√ºlow brought it up in 2003/2004. Br√∂ckers anticipates it just casually.

It¬¥s no topic for mass media. There has been much Bush bashing in german mass media and political left, especially for Iraque war, and even in SPIEGEL; but I really know no mass medium embracing 9/11 CTs. Even leftists like TAZ or Jungle World are bashing Br√∂ckers (who once belonged to the TAZ staff). There are just a few smaller and far-left newspapers casually covering 9/11 CTs in a friendly way (like Junge Welt and NRHZ).

You didn't read Telepolis in 2001, did you? Sounds like you've missed  The WTC Conspiracy .

Folks you would be surprised to see how much debunking i do these days. Several people who i stopped talking to about 9/11 in 2003 or earlier reapproached me in the last half year and are asking for my opinion. Unfortunaly, many ask if i ever heard of Alex Jones...  
 
 
For posterity, here's the cover of SPIEGEL 37/2003, the big debunking effort entitled "Conspiracy 11. September - how conspiracy fanatics turn reality upside down":

It may be discussed more at different pubs though, I can see it coming up at a pub that caters to the Uni\College crowd.

Unfortunately in New York that isn't the case
it can get pretty ugly

the truth movement spits in the face of the victims
every main and a lot of secondary roads in my town are renamed for victims
Chief Ray Downey lived down the block from me
and the 2 brothers (the cop and fireman) who died in the towers, one was my patrol leader in my boyscout troop the other was a leader of the troop and their father was our scoutmaster

on top of that i am a mobile onsite tech
in the year following 911 i must have seen 70 firemens funerals
they take 2 bucket trucks and put them opposite sides of a street
they raise the ladders and drape and american flag between the two buckets
its called "the arches"
they are typical at firemens funerals but to see so many in such a short period of time was overwhelming
i cried every single time i drove through one

i think some of that sadness has transformed into anger towards the truth movement for misrepresenting those who cant talk anymore, and im not alone in thinking like that

I have only ever met one CTer. That was in 2005 and it was at a Skydive DZ in UK. He was a tandem instructor who would leave his laptop on and open at a CT site for all to see as they walked past using the free wifi.

He would try to get the resident Skydivers and visiting participants interested in what he was watching. It seemed at the time to be more about an oil pipeline from Iraq to USA 'War for Oil' stuff. I vaguely remember him trying to convince anyone who would listen that he had a mountain of evidence to support what ever he had. Everyone thought he was cookoo but being a Skydiver hey!

I have never seen or heard any CTer since. Not at work, not down the local pub, never. I suppose without the internet it wouldn't exist.

ehh
war for profit, invasion under false pretense holds a lot more merit than superlasers and the other nonsense lol
even though i think they just FUBAR'd the whole thing from beginning to end (on the leadership end)
the military has done a great job with what they had to work with

Agreed, but never met any military personel on the ground whilst serving who believed a CT, particularly one about a 'War for Oil'. Seems that most CTers have never actually experienced any of the issues/topics/employments which they try to debate. Its easier for them to tap away at a keyboard and act all hard and educated.
 
 
Czech Republic here:
Exactly one truther found in capital city.(one million citizens)
In fact there are nearly no CT of foreing origins to be found. We have our own CT,but they are just about us and at best includes Russia.(no wonder...)

There was recently poll and top stuff was all domestic.
Note: those CTs are: -Velvet Revolution was staged by communists to mantain their power.(If interest,I can start new topic in main CT section about them all)
-Privatisation was setup in such way to enrich only few individuals
and bunch of lesser known...

Yep, I agree, of all the pubs I visit and that is quite a few, I have never heard it discussed. I would go as far as to say I have never heard it discussed anywhere at anytime.
 
 
I think that in Europe, Scandinavia at least, people are a tad naive when it comes to media. Now, very few people thing that all that is in the media is actually true, but many have considerable problems with grasping that it is sometimes complete fabrication.

Thus, when they see Fox News or Discovery relating some crazy conspiracy or woo story, they tend to think that there may be something to it.

Otherwise I guess CE is probably not far off, with the exception of the nutty idea that JREF skeptics think that the official account is 100% correct.

You haven't stated the starting statistical base.

Ask people, and 75 to 90% will say, "Huh, you mean there's crap passing around that it wasn't the 19 suicidal Islamist hijackers? Mein Gott, those crazy kids think of something weirder every year!"
Then you can apply 15%, 70%, 15% ratios to the few who are even atuned.

I work with Europeans of all stripes, in a German company. Not a person I asked when this got very active in '06 had even heard of the conspiracy theories, and today, while some have heard of it, no one's aware of the nuances of the different theories, sub-theories, plots within plots, etc...

As has often been noted, if you turn off the computer 911 Truth ceases to be.

Sweden: I have yet to meet a truther IRL. AFAIK they are a handful, mainly centering around the site vaken.se ("awake.se"). One (yes, singular) of them have sprung into action by the danish-connection (Harrit) Jones nanothermite publication had, and have published a few articles on the respectable site Newsmill.se - but in the "free" section were they publish almost anything. Apart from that, I'd say most swedes accept the common account. I'm pretty sure that most swedes would just look uninterested if a truther started talking about missiles into Pentagon.

Forget that, progge. I misread what you said. Of course you're right, Br√∂ckers doesn't deal with stuff like "missile hit pentagon". Wisnewski btw recently cashed in 5000‚Ç¨ by winning a libel suit against the Technical University of Berlin - they portrayed his work on 9/11 as "antisemitic" with quotes that weren't from him at all.

Quick story.

About a year ago, some black British kid uploaded a video on YouTube in which he spent about five minutes ranting and raving every trutherism he could think of-- Free fall speed, 85 seized videos of the pentagon attack, foreknowledge, etc. etc. This kid, who was about 17 or 18, was completely adamant about 9/11 truth. He said "all his friends felt the same way". I asked him if he thought there were hijackers on 9/11 and he said yes. I asked him why he doubts that AA77 struck the pentagon if he thought there were hijackers. He blocked me before I could get an answer.

On occassion that¬¥s a method to discredit annoying people.   Wisnewski gets my goat, but he¬¥s no anti-semite. Perhaps the people at TU Berlin got misleading informations from Jaecker¬¥s "Antisemitische Verschw√∂rungstheorien nach dem 11. September" ("Anti-semitic conspiracy theories in the wake of 9/11"), which is an unfair book in some respect. It¬¥s worth a read, though.

Br√∂ckers - in my opinion - is the best CT advocate over here, at least in his early articles (before he came up with "hijackers still alive" claims and Hopsicker stuff).

Thats the MO on youtube. Some CTers are now even moderating their own videos and totally preventing anyone who dares call them out on the BS. I wont name them here as that would inflate their ego and we cant have that can we. They also spend time trawling from one friends video to another blanketing each CT video with false praise and spambotting the same old copy/paste lines. Its quite funny really because the only people now posting are angry fools who swear alot with no education. Only going further down hill me thinks.

I dunno, my wife reckons it's fake because "it would just be so unfair if he was gay".
 
 
Well, f**k me. Trutherism is still active in France.
I almost forgot this. Here's moorea34's account about the projection of the Zero movie in a city in the South of France. As my english is a bit broken, the translation is rough, so please forgive me for the errors which will occur. The original version can be read  HERE .

 
On Thursday, the 28th of May 2009, a projection of the Zero movie at a cinema theatre was set in Montpellier. This night was organized by  ReOpen911  and Les amis du Monde Diplomatique. About two hundred were present in the theatre, according to the leaders. The room seemed quite full.

This night was separated in two parts: first, the projection of the movie, then a short documentary with several interviews of truthers on TV. Of course, the Harrit one on dutch television was popular. The projections of the movies took place from 20.20 to about 22.45.

The movie is quite popular in the room: Dario Fo's clowning are convincing. The editing is efficient. Unfortunately, this is rubbish, as the arguments are a catastrophe.

[Moorea34] intervened in order to say what he was thinking of the movie on a scientific sight. Despite he introduced himself and saying what his job was, the next guy who talked and accused him to be an "argument from authority", although he also sais what his job was. He clowned a lot in order to explain that all moorea34's arguments are "details" and the 9/11 had to be taken into its own globality.

Then, a lot of intervenants, notably those of the filmmaker (who admitted there were contradictions in his movie) which dealt with geopolitical stuff.

When moorea34 was allowed to speak again, he refuted the "argument from authority", explaining that he invited people to chat with him for six months and to go in some research laboratories with him. The only person who came is not a member of ReOpen911.info, but he's a sympathizer. He was present in the room, and then intervened to blame moorea34 that the latter wasn't able to answer all questions for two hours and a half, from 11 to 13.30, without eating, and was accused to avoid the questions on the WTC7. This person had recorded the conversation, and wanted to show this to other people, "proving" that moorea34 would be a dishonest person.

[...]

The argument from incredulity was the main argument. Of course, it's not valid. This is not because people don't believe the scientific version that scientific people are total basterds.

Usual clich√©s have been extensively used: the "cui bono?" argument, "Bush is an idiot". More astounding, someone evocated Galileo (not the mentally ill poster here) (*)

The 600 architects and engineers have been also evocated. moorea34 precised that few of them were structural engineers, and one of them, a french man, wrote to him and said he wished he had read  his website  before signing Gage's petition.

After 45 minutes, moorea34 felt that no technical question would be asked (although they are 50% of the movie), and then left the room. One of his trainees was also present: she was interested by the discussion aroudn the vending machine. Another trainee had to join them, but couldn't free himself and come. Perhaps he did well ; if he had come, he would have finished the night at the hospital.

Moorea34's goal is not to heat the debate, which is already much passionated. He insisted to ask two local truthers to come in his lab to debate, but they hadn't answered to this invitation yet.

the older the people are, the less informed they are. The reason is, that they have no internet-connection.
Concerning the Pentagon-Attack, I do not think, it was hit by a missile. There are just too many witnesses, which report from a big airplane. Unfortunately, loose change has brought many people on the wrong track - after my judgment. Most European "truthers", do not follow my judgment.

 
my grandfather is on facebook
he is 87 lol
 
 
Looks like I have been mistaken.

Petr H√°jek spokesman for czech president has published book where among other idiocy are following claims(no evidence for them BTW):
-There are two kind of people - those who are with president and therefore rightwing and others are marxists
-G.W.Bush is Marxist
-911 attacks were most probably inside job
-Bin Ladin is virtual figure...

Czech president sort of supports it.

I never thought that such huge idiocy will be written by somebody that visible.(This surpassed local levels by an order of magnitude)

ETA:And those who take a loot at discussion,yes we have truthers as well. But all that is visible are some small discussions...
 
 
Is calling someone a Marxist an insult in Europe?

One of the reasons I started this thread was to try to understand why people from other countries have such a strong interest in U.S. politics (i.e. 9/11 investigator) and conspiracy theories regarding the U.S. government. In the U.S., no one can even name a Prime Minister. No one even knows what a Prime Minister is.

As far as I am aware only in central and eastern Europe due to history.(1948-1989 for my country) it implies that said person wishes to implement theory created by Marx and Lenin)

As for what is Prime Minister,that is not that suprising,although we are though various styles of goverment including subclasses of indirect democracy.(First republic of Czechoslovakia BTW was mix of presidental and parliamentary democracy,like France)

As for interest,you are affecting strongly us and what happens there can significantly alter rest of world.(Applies only to present not future)

If it wasn't for spokesman our local idiots would be quite invisible...

And last note we have at least in some schools quite strong history lessons.(It used to be in majority,but "school reform killed it and rest of subjects...)

This european and czech rant was brought to you by NWO Cyborg Klimax.
Enjoy.

Here in the Czech Republic it is (and rightly so). We just prefer to call them Bolshevics  

And as Klimax has written: Our president is a conspiracy theorist (AGW and EU among other things) and surrounds himself with total nutcases.
Here's the translated article from Petr H√°jek where he denies evolution just as good as any American creationist could:  http://translate.google.com/translat...istory_state0= 

But I found that most people over here are refreshingly critical of conspiracy theories.

Right. And how did I miss you here? (I though I am alone...)  

And it appears that only few news sites are running with this at the moment.
Unfortunately natove translation is not available AFAIK.(Does iHned still carry english version?)

I was aware of you (*evil laugh*). I wasn't very active here but it seems that's changing...

Damn! Now I gotta go to work

That was same for me. Anyway I am student and part-time IT-manager/admin/...

Not many. I don't know if there even are any hardcore truthers over here. Then again I saw the 9/11 Mysteries DVD at Bontonland, so maybe there is a market (but I keep checking and it's still there; I guess it's for the tourists anyway   ).

Good. I have seen only one czech truther. Libertarian... (Sadly it was student on MFF... combinated form - physics)

What is (little bit) suprising that nobody who objects to USA influnece here (like that radar base) didn't try to use these "doubts"...

I wonder why...

I think a lot of it has to do with the language barrier. Let's face it: Czechs in general aren't very good at English and truthers in general aren't very good at writing clearly. So what they have over here are mostly the videos if someone bothers to translate the subtitles for them.

I met a couple of people who watched Loose Change or some similar piece of disinfo and believed it superficially. But when I confronted them with logic and facts they saw the light pretty quickly. My NWO handler was pleased.
 
 
Over here in holland ( neighbour of Germany) 9/11 has been a pretty big issue, bigger than in most other European countries I believe. Why ? because we have troups in Afganistan because of 9/11 and had some in Irak for a while.
We have some hardcore conspirasists over here thats for sure. The discussion is pretty much the same as here, but it needs more non-official debunking resources. In general the Dutch speak English.

Almost no people above 40 years of age believe in the demolitions, no planes etc.

(speaking of demolitions,Explosieve demolition expert Danny Jowenko happens to live just a block away from me, no way he believes the conspiracy theories!)

Mark Roberts has done a grat job with his website, very helpfull for debunking CT's but I think it provides a lot more than that, you can learn a lot about the United States from it on lots of issues.
 
 
By the Way, people like Richard Gage and Steven Jones get far too much attention over here. As soon as they publish some of thier stuff they have people spreading it all over the internet.

Call yourself an expert, produce some 'scientific' report that supports de CT's and you have world wide publicity all for free and a lot of people willing to spend money to support you.

It is partially blessing and partially curse as majority of debunking sources are in english...

AFAIK that truther didn't argument by videos.(And he knew english)

I didn't get chance at convincing him. After that day I never saw him again...
(No,he wasn't disappeared as it would be by me then.   )

No need to rush anything. We have access to his e-mail and phone, so let's just wait and see what he's up to. We can make him disappear just before his brilliant website full of new evidence goes up. You never know, maybe he'll meet some girl in the meantime and forget about the truth.

No problem. As long as you keep humiliating the Germans at football and don't outlaw coffeeshops we will always love you
