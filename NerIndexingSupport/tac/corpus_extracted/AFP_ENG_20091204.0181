Romania's President Traian Basescu on Friday appealed to liberals to support his
bid for re-election in Sunday's runoff vote, despite their alliance with his
social democrat rival.

Basescu, centre-right leader of the governing Democrat-liberal party (PDL), said
Romania needed a right-wing coalition government during his last electoral
meeting organised in Bucharest on Friday.

"We need a strong right-wing alliance of the PDL and the PNL (Liberals in
opposition) to implement reforms", Basescu said.

But the liberals have already announced they will join forces with the Social
democrats (PSD, opposition) for the coming run-off.

They also agreed to create a coalition government if social-democrat leader
Mircea Geoana wins the election.

According to a poll released before the second round, Geoana is the favourite
candidate in the race.

The liberal candidate Crin Antonescu arrived third in the first round of voting
two weeks ago with 20 percent of the votes.

"Romania needs a right-wing government, the PSD can no longer lead the country's
destiny", Basescu insisted.
