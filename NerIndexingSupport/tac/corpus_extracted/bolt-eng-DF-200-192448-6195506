 
 
is afghanistan another losing war for all the foreign soldiers?
 
 
well like its been writtin down in history the pashtuns of afghanistan have never let an invader win a war aganist them and they have shown this with the arabs, soviet union, british empire ( 3 anglo-afghan wars were afghans won all 3 and at the end of one only letting 1 soldier live to tell the tale), iranians etc. by the looks of it this again is another war that seems not winnable from the pashtuns.

what do you people think?
 
 
I don't think the UK has any business helping the USA in its War on Terror. I see no evidence that Bin Laden "hates our way of life", as Blair used to say when he was PM.

I only think NATO intervention is a good thing since the Taliban was the most repressive regime on Earth by a country mile. I think the Afghan people have suffered enough in recent times without the Taliban assuming power again.
 
 
Afghanistan can't be won. If the Russians couldn't win it then what chance do we have? especially considering the power of Russia at the time.

How can you win against men in their own back yard? It's all a mountainous region as well so its as bad as Vietnam. Those boys could pop up anywhere and get launch a rocket.

But the way i see it, the only way to beat them in that kind of war is to just nuke it to high hell. Leave nothing left alive and your sorted. The same should be done in Iraq.

Eh? Nuke Iraq to hell? It was much better since America came in and Saddam managed to handle the people to not do stupid things like carry a gun in the middle of the street or set of explosions OR have Afghans roaming around.

I'll nuke your mum, how does that sound?
 
 
You'll nuke my mom?

i think you should shut your mouth!

A man is allowed his own opinion, and im not gonna let the likes of you change that.

yes maybe iraq has got better, but i still believe that it is a problem that isn't gonna change over night, and no matter what happens it will continue to be a dangerous country.

The Soviets made an enemy of almost every Afghan, we on the other hand have the majority of them on our side. Because of this we can win in Afghanistan.

An interesting question, but I would say we have already taken their back yard and are using their house to relax in. The trouble is they have moved next door, so more than likely we will need to take over another garden sometime soon.
(Anyone think I stretched that analogy enough?)

Its actually not all mountainous, but it is difficult terrain. But this makes life just as hard for them as us.

the terrian is difficult but for them it is easy becouse they have lived there thier whole life they are used to fighting in that terrain and have the upper hand but then again the invaders have much better weapons compared to the mujahideen. it is hard for the invaders to win and i also think its another unwinnable war.
 
 
Rubbish? I'll start with whatever i want.
I would have nuked it a long time ago. I know alot of innocents would be killed, but everybody is innocent untill they pick up a gun.

Your so sure that we're in control then why don't you join up and go out there and try and beat them. you say it's just a matter of time before we win, but i'll bet any money that that war wont be won. Just you wait and see. And if we have to invade someone elses backgarden then surely that is just more hassle and bother than we can afford, look how hard it is for us just to secure helman province. We have lost alot of soldiers and our armed forces are stretched enough as it is. So i don't think invading someone elses back garden is on the table.

We have been making enemies of the people, i heard on the news a while back that bombers have been dropping bombs on suspected places of Taliban forces and all other rogues, only they don't know if it's hitting enemies or innocents.

This is somewhat of a blanket statement. Do you think that everyone who is fighting is from the boarder regions? If Terry Taliban is from Kabul, he isn’t going to have the first idea what he is doing.
So whilst they do get an advantage from being the natives its hardly a war winner.

I think it’s impossible for the Taliban to win, and if we strike more often within Pakistan we can wrap Afghanistan up in the next 8 years or so.

So you think dropping nukes is a viable option do you?

[QUOTE=El Hosko]I would have nuked it a long time ago. I know alot of innocents would be killed, but everybody is innocent untill they pick up a gun.
Then I am putting you in prison for rape.

I passed Army selection on the 13th August.

Why wont we win? Give me a few examples of how the Taliban is going to remove us from Afghanistan.

If we struck the Taliban whilst they were hiding in Pakistan they would have nowhere else to run. The USA has been far to accommodating with its dealings with Pakistan imo.

Actually, no we havnt.

Now of course I think that one death is too many, but the simple fact is, in 7 years we have taken 115 casualties, this is very low. Just compare this to the Falklands conflict, we lost more than double the number in just two weeks.

Granted our forces are stretched, but intending their area of operation by a few hundred miles isn’t going to be much trouble.

This sort of thing will always happen. Yes we have made mistakes and there are some people who have been drawn to the Taliban because of our actions, but its far less than the amount who have joined the Afghan army.
 
 
rape? where in hell did you get that from?

congratualations on passing army selection. now go and win that war that you are so sure you can win.

Pakistan are a powerful nation in their own right, i think it would be a terrible idea to attack them in their country, okay maybe only a few hundred miles but if you have to continually keep on pushing into other territories then soon enough your fighting a war against that entire region. And you admitted yourself that we are overstretched as it is. So just how are we going to beat all those nations?

If the Afghan people have beaten us before then surely they can do it again. You say that one death is more than enough, and we have lost over 100. In another 8 years we have lost twice that figure and if the Government wants to stay in power or if the Torries realistically want to take over then they have to submit to the people and withdraw out of Afghanistan. If we just tightened up security in our own country then we wouldn't have a problem with terrorists so we don't need to be in Afghanistan so we wouldn't need to lose any more lives.

well if any Arab can turn into a terrorist and you think thats evidence enough to nuke them, I think the fact your packing some form of genitalia is evidence enough that your going to be a rapist…

Its called jumping to conclusions and making outlandish remarks.

I plan to do my small part if I can.

Indeed

Not attack per say, but conduct strikes within their boarders, something the US has been doing for the last few months. The fact is we have given Pakistan a ched load of cash over the last few years, and some pretty fantastic military technology. Its time their bill came due.

We arnt, we are going to get these nations to fight the Taliban/extremists. After all its just as much their problem as ours, just look at Pakistan!

If you are talking about the previous British invasions, the last one of those was battalion strength, so was hardly an Invasion.

You don’t seem to grasp that a few hundred casualties are nowhere near enough to cause us to leave Afghanistan. The Falklands war was and is massively popular, and our losses were far higher.

Not true. Face it, you cant stop every threat, the terrorists only need to be lucky once.

The problem will be sorted when America leaves. We(The UK) left Basra and there pretty much sitting in bases and not on the front line. Look at how the quality of life has improved over there.

If you think that the only problem is to nuke them and kill 20m+ then your head needs looking into.

The Soviets had too many problems in afghanistan, they were using troops trained to fight in a combined arms action in a european theatre, in a mountainous region aainst a guirilla force instead of a regular army. The Afghan war is why Russian Soldiers dont ride inside their armoured personal carriers, but ride on top of them, in Afghanistan, the muj would pop up with an RPG, and anyone inside would be killed, Riding on top meant there was a better chance of escape. Because of the Afghan war, the Russians had to spend loads on Updating equipment for use in mountainos terrain. The British, with all the faults the media like to point out, were much better equiped for that sort of conflict than the soviets were.
 
 
you lot keep forgetting the afghan people(pashtuns) are people that will defend thier women, land, and honour even if it means they have to die and to win a war aganist them is quite impossible in thier own land and no offence to any country but the whole world has learnt this the hard way by losing. i mean take the anglo-afghan war 2, the british fought with guns while the afghans fought with swords but they still won, quite unbelivable but true. and for someone to think they are going to win the war again becouse they have updated weapons is just out of reach. i dont blame the british for trying to invade i mean afghanistan is a very central area in asia which has routes to many other countries, if it becomes stable it would be a great place for trading etc. but on a serious level the british have learnt there lesson 3 times and really should stop following america becouse now it is time for america to lose. i mean think about it the pashtun people like thier freedom so much that thier own goverment finds it hard to have control over them.

I agree. This sums it up well:  http://martinrain.wordpress.com/2009...-nato-crusade/ 
 
 
this myth that no-one has managed to win a war against the afghans has gone on far enough. most of afghanistan was subjagated by the british and before that both genghis khan (with a 90% mounted force) and alexander the great took the mountains and beat the tribes.

when everyone makes the afghans out to be invincible it clouds any objective look at whether we can win the war.

the war IS winable, the taliban have been pushed back out of several provinces that they tried to take last year. in helmand the taliban have lost much of the terrortory they gained in the brief time it took for NATO troops to get used to this theatre when they took over from the US.
 
 
When we first went into Afghanistan, the plan was to defeat the afghans, now it is unite the afghans.

It is a war that can never be won since the objective of us being stationed in Afghanistan still to this day remains unclear.

I seriously cannot stop watching your signature pic.  
 
 
Well this time, it's not the Americans funding the Taliban is it? This war is completely different to any other faced by the Pashtuns/Afghan population in general (since Afghanistan is a ethnically diverse nation, where Pashtuns aren't the only ethnic group). They lack the mainstream support that they enjoyed and relied upon in the Russian-led war. They aren't fighting against purely against soldiers, anymore - the US can just send in a drone and obliterate entire communities. The only way the Taliban and their supporters can 'win' this fight, and I deliberate stress the word win, is by drawing in so many fighters that the war is prolonged to a point of ceasefire. Already, the Karzai regime is entirely supportive of dialogue and cooperation with the Taliban (surely stressing his 'peaceful' - ie weak-spined - intentions) and the US/UK are considering it too.

Great.
 
 
The reason why the war wont be won is because before the US and the UK went in, they didnt bother learning anything about the middle east, its history or its people. They thought they could use an old school command and conquer tactic which has failed to a small insurgency group ?

IMO, if more study had been done in these areas, then it could have been possible to get more afghans on the western side to fight against the Taliban. Instead, we dropped bombs on them instead, and wonder why they hate us.

Getting in isn't so hard, invading it isn't so hard but holding it is like a curse.

It doesn't matter if you push them out, it makes no difference ultimately. They will still fight and when you leave they will take over. If you stay they will wear you down.
