As a huge Cain supporter, huge fan of the 999 plan and a donor to his campaign, it is hard for me to say, but I think it's true. The leftist media have done a great job knocking down a good man. They won't let this sexual harassment controversy go down. They were screaming about let the accusers talk, her douche bag lawyer said she wants to talk so allow her to talk. The NRA said cool let her talk, but now she says sorry I don't want to talk.

The media won't release any details or the accusers names, as respect for the accuser. Oh please! I don't buy that.

Whether their true or false, whether they were genture not meant to make the women feel unconfortable, but they, doesn't matter now. The media labeled Cain guilty until, well there isn't any until, he will remain guilty.

He will never be able to get back on message. Republican primary voters will be too afraid to vote for him. I expect him to lose and not be dubbed the VP either. I am satisfied with Romney, but I prefer Cain.

Sadly I don't think Cain can rebound from this one.
 
 
I agree..
 
 
 
I agree..

 

Sad that it won't be the voters that decide on Cain it's the media that did it.

They destroyed Sarah as well.. it's no big surprise. Newt can take the hits.. he's also been thoroughly vetted. Fuck the leftist media.
 
 
cain is toast due to his past actions which have caught up with him...did he not expect the media to find these claims and settlements?
 
 
sarah never had any intentions of running for president....she was all about the cash
 
 
they must have set the toaster to dark.......
 
 
 
cain is toast due to his past actions which have caught up with him...did he not expect the media to find these claims and settlements?

 

Really: If Cain wanted to run for president after becomming entangled in sexual piccadellos, then he joined the wrong party.
 
 
 
sarah never had any intentions of running for president....she was all about the cash

 

Perhaps? There's no denying the media went after her with a furious vengeance. That did the same to Hillary when she ran against Obama in the Democrat Primary.. The Media have their pets.. for the most part they're liberal.
 
 
 
cain is toast due to his past actions which have caught up with him...did he not expect the media to find these claims and settlements?

 

No. if cain is toast its due to people making up crap about him.
 
 
Wait--Cain could be the GOP answer to Bill Clinton!

Lots of accusations, Lots of molested women, lots of "No it wasn't me!" and a fantastic economy for the next 6 to 7 years.

I am supporting Cain--if he can make the left cry "Sexual Harassment" then he has to be better than Clinton!!
 
 
 
 
cain is toast due to his past actions which have caught up with him...did he not expect the media to find these claims and settlements?

 

No. if cain is toast its due to people making up crap about him.

 

How do you know?

If this was a Dem candidate, you'd be smelling the smoke and wondering where the fire was.
 
 
 
 
cain is toast due to his past actions which have caught up with him...did he not expect the media to find these claims and settlements?

Either that, or he thought his stuff wasn't so bad after watching people like Larry Craig and John Ensign.
 
 
So sad when people just cry about the media and refuse to ever accept that their politician won't win because americans don't want him to win.

I'm a Ron Paul supporter, yes it's true the media hates him cuz he's not a status quo rep or dem, but that's not why he won't be elected. It's because those who vote still like status quo reps and dems for whatever reason.

You left out these wankers:

Jim McGreevey, Mel Reynolds, Gerry Studds.. come now, be an equal opportunity basher.
 
 
 
cain is toast due to his past actions which have caught up with him...did he not expect the media to find these claims and settlements?

 

Don't be silly. The man obviously doesn't understand the concept of personal responsibility.

Nor does Ghook.

But hey, maybe Ghook doesn't want to vote for him now because he's black.

Not quite what I'm saying..........Cain saw how the GOP circled the wagons around those people and decided that since he'd only been accused of harassment (and confidentiality agreements were signed) that even if this did crop up, the GOP would circle around him and it would go away.

Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be the case.

The evidence is unconvincing. The timing is suspect with the latest one. It just so happens that when the original alleged victims were given permission to speak freely and choose not to, that a completely unknown woman with Gloria Allred as her attorney comes out of nowhere?

Even ignoring the BS political stunts Allred has played over the years, dont you think it's kind of odd that she doesn't show up until it's obvious that no one is going to actually step forward to make a claim?

And if something actually happened, why wouldn't the oirginal complaintents say something? They have plenty of motivation to come forward and virtually none not to.

Had this latest one been real, it would have come out the first week of the scandal. Not conveniently after none of the others alleged victims pan out. Major credibility issue from the gate.

They attempted to be Politicians!

If the media don't expose them, who will?

You know..........on the first 2, I'd believe it, because there are court documents and cases were filed and paid, we just can't get to them because of the confidentiality agreements signed in those cases.

As far as the 3rd one? Not sure, sounds kinda iffy.

As far as the 4th one? Something definitly is rotten in Denmark, because Alred is one of those ambulance chasing whores who seeks publicity and money only, no matter if she's on the right side or not.

But the first 2, I believe are true.

Um....Ensign and Craig resigned.

What exactly do you mean "the GOP circled around them?"

I think you're confusing them with the DNC, Barney Frank, and Anthony Weiner.

No they actually served in office as politicians.

Regardless, you're correct: it should be the responsibility of the media to reveal the FACTS about candidates. It is the responsibility of those candidates' parties to vet them, and it is OUR choice to decide if the facts matter.
 
 
 
sarah never had any intentions of running for president....she was all about the cash

 

liar
 
 
Likely all of these claims are basless and brought by opportunists looking for a buck at the time. I have personally known of a hundred for more harassment claims, not one of which was real. All of them ginned up to make a dollar.

I recall one, a nurse in San Pedro Peninsula Hospital who claimed hostile working environment because she observed a doctor give his wife a good bye kiss in the parking lot. The nurse got a few thou out of it. It is suspect that these claims are exactly the same type of claim. Vague harassments, accusations of hostile working environment, all these claims are bogus and they always were. The media is going to make as big a thing as they need to out of it. They excell in making or breaking a candidate.
 
 
Wow, a huge Cain supporter! Maybe you can do something none of the others even try to do when I ask them... Name five policies you like that Cain offers, go in depth, please!
 
 
If Cain was a liberal Democrat, we would have even heard about any of this stuff.
 
 
This serves to prove how utterly stupid liberals are.
 
 
I feel sorry for Cain on any front. If the allegations are false and meant simply to destroy him, what a horrible thing to have to go through. If the allegations are true, then he needs to drop out of the race for president and seek help for being a sexual cad. Either way, I wouldn't trade places with him for anything. He's in the hot seat now, and he asked for it.

You've just outlined pretty much why I would never run for political office. Either there is something in your past that they latch onto and won't let go of (best defense is to admit it and move on), or they will make up some crap just so your opponent can win the election.

Me? I was in one of the most high visibility jobs at my commands, and after 20 years, it's good to be out of the fishbowl.

Being psychopathological probably wouldn't help your candidacy either.

Nope.........not a psychopath or any other kind of mentally unstable type. If I was, it would have shown up in the psych screenings when I got my Top Secret clearance.

Somewhat right. If he handled it better, he might have been able to come through to the other side. But he handled it like an amateur and has even the most devote Cain supporters (like me) doubting him!

Of course they would.....

Sure.
 
 
 
So sad when people just cry about the media and refuse to ever accept that their politician won't win because americans don't want him to win.

I'm a Ron Paul supporter, yes it's true the media hates him cuz he's not a status quo rep or dem, but that's not why he won't be elected. It's because those who vote still like status quo reps and dems for whatever reason.

 

Ron Paul is starting to seem more appealing to me, but he has a raw deal.

The Leftist media hates him for being way to far right. Imagine the Paul bashing the would occur if Paul jumped to number 1 in the polls. The racist newsletters would be an hourly conversation piece on MSNBC and they would be talking about Paul pushing seniors, babies, students, blacks, latinos etc over the cliff! It would be relentless.

But then the right leaning media doesn't like him anymore, because of his foreign policy stance. They either ignore him or bash him relentless. Conservative bloggers aren't any nicer.
 
 
Should Cain drop from the race? Consider, if elected Cain will be vulnerable to civil action by those who have claimed his behavior was 'inappropriate' as noted in the OP [See: Clinton v. Jones, 520 US 681 (1997)].

Can our nation afford another fiasco and politically motivated constitutional crisis in Washington D.C.?
Can we afford the cost of a special prosecutor and months of gridlock in our already gridlocked national capitol?

Cool.

So we should all be able to pick off our opponents from now on by the simple expedient of getting some anonymous women to accuse them of sexual harassment!

Yeah. Fuck that presumption of innocence thing.

Come on Wry. I know you and I don't see eye to eye on much of anything, but surely even YOU have to recognize how silly that would be.

No.. he needs to hang in there and fight like hell. Conservatives don't cower or throw in the towel where liberal propaganda and the politics of personal destruction thrive. That cannot stand regardless of what happens.
 
 
 
You know..........on the first 2, I'd believe it, because there are court documents and cases were filed and paid, we just can't get to them because of the confidentiality agreements signed in those cases..

 

Don't be dishonest. There were no court cases filed. There were internal complaints and servance paid out. Second, the NRA released a statement that they are waiving the confidentiality agreements. The women are free to speak publics. Lastly, O'Donnell offered to pay their legal bills.

 
As far as the 3rd one? Not sure, sounds kinda iffy.

 

I agree

 
As far as the 4th one? Something definitly is rotten in Denmark, because Alred is one of those ambulance chasing whores who seeks publicity and money only, no matter if she's on the right side or not.

 

She seems like a woman scorn. She came to Cain for help to get her job back and he probably brushed her off, he might have even insulted her saying she didn't deserve the job.

 
But the first 2, I believe are true

 

Without any details how can one even make such a statement!

Why do you say that?
Did you go out with him?
Is he the 60 Minute Man, or what?
I love it when you talk dirty.  

You are just sorry that he is not a Democrat, right?

She came off like she was reading a very practiced script full of Democratic Talking Points. Very well Rehearsed, but lacking in credibility. Where was all the outrage? Who would keep that bottled up so long and come off so clear and on point with the DNC Spearhead? Is she running for something?

Wow, a huge Cain supporter! Maybe you can do something none of the others even try to do when I ask them... Name five policies you like that Cain offers, go in depth, please!

 

(1) Jobs and Economic Plan : Replacing the small business killing payroll tax, the capital gains tax, death tax and lowering the corporate and income into the 999 plan. Seeing the economic boom it will create.

(2) Social Security : PROVEN Chilean social security method.

(3) Drilling : Plans to curtail the EPA, drill outshore, drill in ANWR and promote energy exploration.

(4) Bill Size : Read regulation from 1800s and most of the 1900s, there were the 1000 page monstrosities they are today. There are no reason they should be that big. The only reason they are that big is because they want to make sure Congress can't read them before they vote on them. I like Cain's small bill only policy. They shouldn't be longer than 25-50 pages.

(5) Business Regulation Reform : Business regulation reform starting with getting rid of Dobb-Frank is sorely needed. Who better than a businessman like Cain!

Sadly I don't think Cain can rebound from this one.

 

Not with Cain constantly changing his story, offering contradictory explanations, and then declaring the subject now off-limits without ever dealing with the specifics, he can't.
 
 
No...not toast. The fact that Gloria Alred is involved is highly suspect.

Liberal media standard for:

- Non-liberals: No explanation is good enough

- Liberals: No explanation is required

You don't like those standards? We need a good Republican like Jake or Right Winger to say how the media which despises Republicans isn't liberal at all, in fact they lean right.
 
 
 
cain is toast due to his past actions which have caught up with him...did he not expect the media to find these claims and settlements?

 

Funny how far worse actions had no impact on Bill Clinton.

I guess it helps if the press is just the propaganda arm of your party.
 
 
 
Don't be silly. The man obviously doesn't understand the concept of personal responsibility.

 

Maybe you can teach him about it, Rati.

Use Ted Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Bawney Fwank as object lessons.

 
Nor does Ghook.

But hey, maybe Ghook doesn't want to vote for him now because he's black.

 

 

I'm guessing that would be you, Rati.

Cool.

So we should all be able to pick off our opponents from now on by the simple expedient of getting some anonymous women to accuse them of sexual harassment!

Yeah. Fuck that presumption of innocence thing.

Come on Wry. I know you and I don't see eye to eye on much of anything, but surely even YOU have to recognize how silly that would be.

 

Presumption of innocence should never be 'fucked', it is a cornerstone of our system of jurisprudence. I'm suggesting Mr. Cain might consider the potential consequences if he is elected and if he did anything which might lead him to facing the judgment and ridicule that would follow.

I didn't suggest picking off Mr. Cain, or Gingrich for that matter, in fact Cain's nomination in face of the interest the American public in matters of salacious rumor would benefit President Obama. The focus would not be on the substantive issues facing our nation; it would IMO continue the partisan practice of character assassination which is the grist of our free press.

Seriously, you'd run as a Communist out of the DNC. You'd have nothing to worry about. Only Republicans are subject to standards or scrutiny.

It's not like the Republicans have dug up every gay affair Barack Obama has had, and you know damned well that he's had plenty. No, this crap is reserved for the Republicans.
 
 
 
No...not toast. The fact that Gloria Alred is involved is highly suspect.

 

Exactly - she is a 100% fraud.

That she is involved confirms that Cain is innocent.

I guess "Octo Mom" ran out of cash.

What you are suggesting is that any candidate who gets smeared should consider the consequences of not dropping out -- for all the silly reasons you articulated.

But the problem is that ANYBODY can get similarly smeared.

It would then follow that anybody who gets smeared should consider dropping out.

But it would also follow that since anybody can get smeared, no candidates can ever run the full course.

I'll suggest it again.

You REALLY need to think this stuff through.

Not democrats.

This kind of demagoguery is reserved purely for Republicans.

At this point, ANY Republican is going to get smeared by the leftist hate machine. They want Romney, so they won't attack him in the primary season. They want him because he's easy to beat, like McCain. On the primaries are over, the leftist hate machine will viciously attack anyone who stands against Obama. Lies and slander are the mainstay of the left, and will be unleashed without restraint.

(5) Business Regulation Reform : Business regulation reform starting with getting rid of Dobb-Frank is sorely needed. Who better than a businessman like Cain!

 

Thank you, no one has done that yet.

In the end what I see is a very weak platform if that is what you feel Cain has to offer. To have zero foreign policy is a bit shocking when you take into context the 4-5 wars the US is in. No cuts to balance the budget or talk of how he would shrink the deficit, just wow... Dealing with regulations on business and drilling are as about basic to the Republican platform as being pro life, meaning every single person on that stage offers that. Like repealing Obamacare…

999 is about the only idea Cain has that you posted, but reality is Cain changed it to 909 for “some people”, meaning 2 things… First Cain is already re-creating the same mess he claims his tax policy would fix then he is admitting his plan was in fact bad for 84% of people, after he claimed the people who ran the numbers to prove that were liars... What I mean to say is Cain does not even know where he stands on 999, so how can you or anyone support it when by the time it's passed it could be the polar opposite of what you thought you were voting for.

And bill size?

Anyways I don’t agree with going after Cain about who he might have sexually harassed or not, just like I don’t like the media calling Ron Paul a racist when he is clearly not... But that is how it works, if Cain had a strong policy platform the sexual harassment would have been a non issue. But then I never thought for a second Cain took running for President seriously, who can say they did when they have so few answers about some very basic issues.

Once again, thank you for giving why you support Cain when no one wlse has. To me Cain is the Obama of the right... Some people like him but have no idea why.
 
 
I heard her statement...it's all scripted...and WHY now? The woman had a boyfriend...why didn't she go to the cops?

This is another manufactured attempt. A bimbo that wishes 15 minutes of fame...(The hack Lawyer, Gloria Alred being involved is dubious)...

This thing stinks.

IF this had one iota of legitimacy, there would be a reputable law firm involved. That Allred is on the cased demonstrates it's a complete fraud.
 
 
 
 
 
Cool.

So we should all be able to pick off our opponents from now on by the simple expedient of getting some anonymous women to accuse them of sexual harassment!

Yeah. Fuck that presumption of innocence thing.

Come on Wry. I know you and I don't see eye to eye on much of anything, but surely even YOU have to recognize how silly that would be.

 

Presumption of innocence should never be 'fucked', it is a cornerstone of our system of jurisprudence. I'm suggesting Mr. Cain might consider the potential consequences if he is elected and if he did anything which might lead him to facing the judgment and ridicule that would follow.

I didn't suggest picking off Mr. Cain, or Gingrich for that matter, in fact Cain's nomination in face of the interest the American public in matters of salacious rumor would benefit President Obama. The focus would not be on the substantive issues facing our nation; it would IMO continue the partisan practice of character assassination which is the grist of our free press.

 

What you are suggesting is that any candidate who gets smeared should consider the consequences of not dropping out -- for all the silly reasons you articulated.

But the problem is that ANYBODY can get similarly smeared.

It would then follow that anybody who gets smeared should consider dropping out.

But it would also follow that since anybody can get smeared, no candidates can ever run the full course.

I'll suggest it again.

You REALLY need to think this stuff through.

 

Every candidate for high office will likely be smeared; consider the attacks on Trump, Bachmann, Palin, Romney, Gingrich and Perry in this run up to the 2012 nomination.

Those who have skeletons in the closet might consider the consequences of running for office by evaluating the potential for exposure and ridicule or worse - that is all I suggested.

Four women have now made allegations against Cain, only they and Mr. Cain know the truth, and only from their own perspective of what happened (or didn't). However, today's allegation is more specific and there is a face attached, Sharon Bialek. At her news conference there is a suggestion that others as well as hotel and NRA records may coaborate other aspects of her allegation.
 
 
 
As a huge Cain supporter, huge fan of the 999 plan and a donor to his campaign, it is hard for me to say, but I think it's true. The leftist media have done a great job knocking down a good man. They won't let this sexual harassment controversy go down. They were screaming about let the accusers talk, her douche bag lawyer said she wants to talk so allow her to talk. The NRA said cool let her talk, but now she says sorry I don't want to talk.

The media won't release any details or the accusers names, as respect for the accuser. Oh please! I don't buy that.

Whether their true or false, whether they were genture not meant to make the women feel unconfortable, but they, doesn't matter now. The media labeled Cain guilty until, well there isn't any until, he will remain guilty.

He will never be able to get back on message. Republican primary voters will be too afraid to vote for him. I expect him to lose and not be dubbed the VP either. I am satisfied with Romney, but I prefer Cain.

Sadly I don't think Cain can rebound from this one.

 

The problem is that most people are fucking idiots that would accept unsubstantiated accusations.

All Republicans. The DNC press attacks all enemies of the party.

Even if they don't, the NY Times, MSNBC and the rest of the DNC press will manufacture smears against them.

Gloria Fucking Allred is involved, that is proof that the whole thing is a scam. IF the case had merit, a legitimate law firm would be handling it.

 
However, today's allegation is more specific and there is a face attached, Sharon Bialek. At her news conference there is a suggestion that others as well as hotel and NRA records may coaborate other aspects of her allegation.

 

This could backfire. If Breibart and some of the others dig up proof that this is manufactured, as we ALL know it is (this last one, the others may or may not be) then you turn Cain into a martyr.

Bringing out a blatant fraud is a bold move, a dangerous one for the demagogues of your party.
 
 
If anyone is listening to Michael Savage right now, I suggest you tune in. He is hammering Obama about his multiple Social Security Numbers, lack of a original birth certificate, where he is originally from and why the media hasn't investigated those important things. He is upset because the media is instead digging into Herman Cains past with a vengeance when they never investigated anything questionable about Obama. He is exposing the bias media on not investigating any of Obama's past girlfriends. It's good. Tune in.

Yep. Where were the accusations then? This whole thing is scripted...the woman said "I didn't want to be here today..."

Then why is she? This is garbage written by Alred.
 
 
 
Thank you, no one has done that yet.

 

No problem, I have a lot of respect for black conservatives. It takes courage.

 
To have zero foreign policy is a bit shocking when you take into context the 4-5 wars the US is in.

 

He will need to offset his lack of foreign policy experience with advisor or a VP with foreign policy creditials. What does foreign policy creditials really mean? It means you been in government and have traveled to other countries, but that doesn't make you any better with dealing with tyrants, negotiating peace or trade agreements or figuring out whether to go to war or not. Showing leadership so other countries will follow your lead. Negotiation skills are ingrain and can't be taught. Cain has them. Showing leadership, he is a leader without a doubt.

 
No cuts to balance the budget or talk of how he would shrink the deficit, just wow...

 

That is BULLSHIT. Cain has talked about entitlement reform. He has talked about pension reform. He talked about the Chilean model for social security. That is reforming 22% of the budget. The man talks and preaches reform.

 
Dealing with regulations on business and drilling are as about basic to the Republican platform as being pro life, meaning every single person on that stage offers that. Like repealing Obamacare

 

He is talking about replacement not just repeal. As a successful businessman he knows the "smart" regulation that is needed. Look Texas has enormous regulation on home lending. That is primarily why they didn't get hit with the mortgage meltdown. Under and over regulation are bad you need smart regulation. Cain as a businessman can be TRUSTED to lead the way there!

 
999 is about the only idea Cain has that you posted, but reality is Cain changed it to 909 for some people, meaning 2 things First Cain is already re-creating the same mess he claims his tax policy would fix then he is admitting his plan was in fact bad for 84% of people, after he claimed the people who ran the numbers to prove that were liars... What I mean to say is Cain does not even know where he stands on 999, so how can you or anyone support it when by the time it's passed it could be the polar opposite of what you thought you were voting for.

 

You are doing what you people do to Paul. I have shown in other thread why the 999 plan is great, I won't do it here!

 
And bill size?

 

There is absolutely no reason for bills to be that large. The hundred to thousand page bills are a creation of the last few decades. The reason is so the public and politician won't read it!

 
Anyways I dont agree with going after Cain about who he might have sexually harassed or not, just like I dont like the media calling Ron Paul a racist when he is clearly not... But that is how it works, if Cain had a strong policy platform the sexual harassment would have been a non issue. But then I never thought for a second Cain took running for President seriously, who can say they did when they have so few answers about some very basic issues.

 

I guarantee if Paul hit the 20% in the polls, there would be relentless attacks on him for the newsletter. It would be sick. The liberal media attacks whatever GOP candidate is on top.

The progressive Marxists are just paying any female that has any connection to Cain to claim they were sexually harassed.

It's typical progressive tactics..

Your allegations are blatantly absurd. Suggesting character assassination is the work of Democrats only is ridiculous.
 
 
Savage is dissecting Bialeks comments and stating what this sounds like is that it is she who put the moves on Cain and she got rejected. He is saying if this was so traumatic to her she would have went to the police directly instead and that the police would have raked Cain over the coals immediately for just the allegation of sexually trying to reach for her genitals which would have been a list of charges involved. Instead, she politely asks him to take her home.

You're willfully ignorant (though sometimes I really do believe you're insane). I ran a Domestic Violence Unit, victimology and my experience taught me not to judge victims and in all cases reserve judgment as the facts become known. You believe Weiner, who has not interviewed the alleged victim and is an entertainer who patronizes idiots like you.
 
 
 
 
 
No. if cain is toast its due to people making up crap about him.

 

so you assume he is telling the truth......seems to be shifting truth at best

 

Why do you say that?
Did you go out with him?
Is he the 60 Minute Man, or what?
I love it when you talk dirty.  

You are just sorry that he is not a Democrat, right?  

 

what the hell are you going on about?

the man seems to change his story...and did he not expect this to come out?

what is the 60 minute man....

talk dirty? that is simply in your head

why should i be sorry he is not a democrat?
 
 
 
"Gloria Fucking Allred is involved, that is proof that the whole thing is a scam" Huh? By which standard of proof?

 

By any rational standard of proof.

If a 16 year old boy came forward and said that the sex he had with Barack Obama was forced. and he was represented by Glenn Beck, would that make him less credible?

 
Your allegations are blatantly absurd. Suggesting character assassination is the work of Democrats only is ridiculous.

 

Demagoguery, slander and libel are the basis of the democratic party, it is virtually the only thing they bring to the table.

Andrew Jackson may have founded the democrats, but Josef Goebbels is the father of the modern party.
 
 
 
Shuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut uuuuuuuuuuuuuup... You are the TM of the right.
