Liverpool - Worst fans in Europe?

Does anybody remember the UEFA report that branded Liverpool fans the
worst in Europe? Well i have always thought they were just passionate
about football. However i attended todays game at Anfield and had
stones thrown at me from the Liverpool section when Frank Lampard
equalised. I was in the Chelsea section (Anfield Road Lower) and one
almost hit me on the head but ended up catching me on the shoulder. I
was wondering if the same happened to any CFC fans who went to todays
game and post here on USENET.

They were also outsung almost the entire game until they took the lead
and gave a brief cry of The Fields Of Anfield Road then they were
silent again. Chelsea fans were singing "Where's your famous
atmosphere".

I was quite suprised about this as this did not happen the last time i
visited Anfield. Hopefully it is just a one-off. Even though i do
recall them throwing shite at Man Utd fans the last time they met in
the FA Cup. However im not going to tar all LFC fans with the same
brush as that would be totally unfair and they do have a lot of loyal
non-troublemakers but the minority let them down today.

On February 18 2006 , during a 1-0 defeat by Liverpool at Anfield in
the FA Cup, Alan broke his leg and dislocated his ankle while
attempting to block a free-kick from Liverpool's John Arne Riise, an
injury described by Sir Alex Ferguson as "one of the worst I've seen".
The ambulance carrying the player was then attacked as it attempted to
leave. This is yet more justification for the 'media darlings' tag
applied. "Had United fans ambushed an ambulance with a Liverpool
player in, we'd be strung up for it. It's swept under the carpet when
Liverpool do it. Just like when they trashed our ground in their FA
Cup game against Chelsea last season when they wrote "Munich" and
"Harold Shipman is our God" all over our ground." Red News, a United
fanzine commented on the apparent switch in the treatment of Liverpool
fans for this incident "after initially attacking Liverpool fans for
throwing turds and coins and piss on United fans in the tier below,
now (the media was) giving them glowing reports because they wrote one
letter to Smith and though many did applaud Smith off the pitch, many
also sang that twisted variation of the Riise song at him." (Red News,
February 2006).

You're just lucky that nobody in the Chelsea end unrecognised you
otherwise you'd would have got a proper kicking.

Now i know you are telling lies fuckwit.

There is no way anyone in that section of the ground could throw
anything without a steward or police seeing who did it.

Clearly you were not at the game yesterday and looking at your posting
history IN ASSMU you are nothing but a trolling fuckwit.

The Anfield Road end is split into two sections. The top half holds
the LFC fans and the lower section is where the Chelsea fans were
located. What about my posts to ASSMU?

It was split into two halfs. Chelsea had from the corner flag to
behind the goal. Four blocks. The rest of the lower was LFC fans. CFC
fans were even singing "It's just like Highbury, at Anfield".

benrobertsm ... @hotmail.com was thinking very hard :

 

Chelsea are a club no bigger than "Wolves" who happened to find a
wealthy chairman to buy success.
