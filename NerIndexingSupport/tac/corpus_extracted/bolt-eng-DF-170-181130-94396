Russia Cuts Off Gas to Ukraine in Cost Dispute

MOSCOW, Jan. 1 - Russia cut off the natural gas intended for Ukraine on Sunday as talks over pricing and transit terms unraveled into a bald political conflict that carried consequences for Ukraine's recovering economy and possibly for gas supplies to Western Europe.

The dispute comes a year after the Orange Revolution brought a pro-Western government to power in Ukraine. It ends a decade of post-Soviet subsidies in the form of cheap energy that allowed Russia to retain some influence over the former Soviet republics.

Choking off the westbound pipes is a striking gamble by Russia, one likely to send political and economic ripples westward in the months ahead. Russia is positioning itself to become an energy-supplying nation capable of easing dependency on Middle Eastern oil in Western Europe and even in the United States.

Gazprom, the Russian energy giant, 51 percent of which is owned by the state, provides about a quarter of Western Europe's natural gas. Under a system begun in the Soviet era, 80 percent of Russia's exports to Europe have passed through Ukraine. Gazprom said it had reduced the flow to equal the volumes it agreed to provide to Western countries, minus what the company provides for the Ukrainian domestic market.

On the same day it throttled back its gas to Ukraine, Russia assumed the chairmanship of the Group of 8, the club for the world's large developed economies, promising to push the theme of "energy security."

Sunday's early-winter cut in gas supplies to Ukraine came as an unsettling reminder that promises of energy exports are not Russia's only method of using oil and gas to further its foreign policy goals - it can also turn off the valve of energy exports.

The election of Viktor A. Yushchenko as Ukraine's president last winter pulled the former Soviet country from Russia's sphere of influence. A gas shortage this winter could discredit him and weaken his party, with parliamentary elections coming up in March.

Tellingly, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was personally involved in the negotiations. It was he, rather than company officials, who made the final offer of a grace period on Saturday.

A jump in Russia's utility bill to Ukraine is at the heart of the current conflict. Russia is seeking to charge $220 to $230 per 1,000 cubic meters of natural gas, up from $50. Ukraine's economy has depended on buying cheap energy from Russia, which provides about a third of its natural gas supply.

The 11th-hour effort to head off the shutdown failed. On Sunday, Ukraine's natural gas distributing company, Naftogaz, said it had faxed a draft contract to Russia shortly after 11 p.m. Saturday - agreeing to terms laid out earlier that evening by Mr. Putin, the company said in a statement.

Mr. Putin had suggested a 3-month grace period if Ukraine would agree to pay the higher prices thereafter. Gazprom, however, said Sunday the faxed reply had fallen short of demands.

"We were prepared to come to terms with the Ukrainian people and help maintain comfortable conditions for them during the winter, the most crucial season from the point of view of energy supplies," Gazprom's chief spokesman, Sergei V. Kupriyanov, said on Russian television. "Our proposals were turned down."

At around 10 a.m. on Sunday, Gazprom began cutting the pressure on pipelines at the border with Ukraine, and the effect on the Ukrainian web of pipelines was felt later in the day.

"Russia counts on Ukraine to guarantee the stable supply of Russian gas to European countries in accordance with international obligations fixed in the European Energy Charter," a statement from the Interior Ministry said.

The effects were starting to be felt in Europe on Sunday night. The Hungarian natural gas wholesaler, MOL, said that deliveries from the affected pipeline were down more than 25 percent, according to Reuters, which added that in Poland, supplies dwindled 14 percent.

Polish officials said reserves were adequate for now, and the Hungarian company asked big gas consumers to switch to oil where possible.

Gazprom reduced the pressure in the gas mains leading to Ukraine at three metering stations and ceased boosting pressure in the westbound pipelines from a storage system that is designed to keep the pressure up during peak demand in the winter. It was unclear whether the impact on the other countries was a result of Gazprom's action or whether it was the result of interference by Ukraine.

"It's their task not to take the gas that goes through their territory," a Gazprom spokesman, Denis I. Ignatyev, said in a telephone interview.

Prime Minister Yury I. Yekhanurov of Ukraine said on Sunday that his country was not siphoning gas from the pipeline.

The State Department, expressing hope that the conflict would be resolved, said in a statement: "Such an abrupt step creates insecurity in the energy sector in the region and raises serious questions about the use of energy to exert political pressure. As we have told both Russia and Ukraine, we support a move toward market pricing for energy, but believe that such a change should be introduced over time rather than suddenly and unilaterally."

Mr. Putin has said that Russia's foreign policy will hinge on energy exports. In trips to Germany, Turkey and Japan last fall, he boldly promised not only a secure supply of fuel for the West, but also that Russia could become a much larger energy exporting nation in the years ahead.

He pushed Germany to endorse a multibillion-dollar underwater gas pipeline in the Baltic Sea. Gazprom is hoping to extend the pipe to Denmark, Belgium and Britain. Gazprom is also in talks with a short list of five major energy companies to develop a huge gas field in the Barents Sea, far above the Arctic Circle off western Russia, hoping to ship significant quantities of liquefied natural gas directly to the United States, the world's largest energy consumer.

Gazprom is the Russian government's largest energy policy instrument - though the company sometimes insists it operates only on business principles. The loss of fuel, if it persists, could shake Ukraine's economy the way the 1973 oil embargo helped plunge the United States into recession. Ukrainian officials said the loss could reverse its modest economic growth to cause a contraction of between 4 and 5 percent this year.

The dispute involves complex arguments by Gazprom, which says the price it wants to charge Ukraine is based on the prices of competing fuels, like diesel and bunker oil, on international exchanges. But not far below the surface, there is the embarrassing loss of a Kremlin-backed candidate in last winter's Orange Revolution.

Russia has increased the costs of its natural gas to other former Soviet states, though not as steeply. Belarus, a Russian ally, pays $47 per 1,000 cubic meters.

With its reduction in the flow of natural gas - from a rate of around 120 million cubic meters per day to around 96, according to Gazprom - Russia demonstrated there is only so far Ukraine can go before Russia reacts, and that indeed the country is still within Mr. Putin's range of influence. Each side blamed the other for the breakdown in talks.

"We will take all steps not to allow theft," the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. "We get the impression that the Ukrainian government, feeling themselves uncertain, deliberately decided to break off the negotiation process."

In addition to a large pipeline - called "Brotherhood" for the supposed warm relations between the two Slavic republics in Soviet times - Russian gas enters Ukraine through more than 100 smaller pipes.

"There's a lot of posturing and a lot of ways to put pressure on Ukraine," said Leonid Y. Mirzoyan, an equity analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, a financial company that has investment banking business with Gazprom.

In addition to the natural gas provided by Russia, Ukraine has domestic production and contracts for natural gas from the Central Asian country of Turkmenistan.

Naftogaz officials in Ukraine have said the Russian exports to Western Europe will not diminish. Yet government officials have also said the country will siphon gas from the export routes if necessary. Ukraine is a party to the European Energy Charter, an agreement intended to prevent disruption of fuel passing between countries.

Nonetheless, Mr. Ignatyev, the Gazprom spokesman, said Sunday evening that Gazprom had already detected some siphoning of gas by Ukraine, and that the company would reveal its evidence on Monday.

This crisis will probably cease soon. Ukrain needs this gas. Russia need to export it. and the rest of Europe need it to. particularly countries who didn't import a lot from other countries. Poland's stock is only for 1 week. UK's stock only for 14 days. France for 48, and Germany for 75.
Western Europe has other countries (like France : Algeria and North sea), but some eastern countries, or central countries, like Austria, would have more problem if Russia stop its exportations. There is already a pressure low in Austria.

Russia is trying to regain Ukraine, no?
 
 
if regain means "take back", maybe.
Russia lost influence with the "Orange revolution", when Ioutchenko came at the power. Ukraine went near Europe, and took its distance with Russia. Russia is probably making pay Ukraine for this reason. Putin knows that 80 % of the gas for Europe go through Ukraine.

So, if you were Ukrainian, what would you want your gov't to do? I mean the one you voted for and basically revolted for?
 
 
I would want that the government will find an issue to the crisis, becasue without gas, it's hard...particularly during winter. But Ukraine shouldn't have to pay to much for the gas too....so, 2 interest in contradiction : preservation of the gas for Ukraine, and avoid to pay a lot for it.

If they hold out, find another producer, even more expensive, they will win. If they give in, they will have paid ransom and never be safe from the Bear again.

Something Old, Something New
From the desk of George Adair on Mon, 2006-01-02 10:17

If you hang around long enough, the wayback machine coughs up this one from the Financial Times, circa 13 January 1982 :

SECTION I; Pg. 14
HEADLINE: Study of sanctions impact on pipeline
BYLINE: By David Tonge in London

WESTERN officials are to meet in Washington later this week to discuss the precise implications of U.S. sanctions against the Soviet Union on the construction of the 5,500km Siberia-West Europe gas pipeline.

West Europeans believe the U.S. will not use the recent developments in Poland [in December 1981 the Communist regime in Poland declared a state of war and outlawed Solidarity, whereupon the West introduced economic sanctions against Poland and the Soviet Union] to prevent the pipeline going ahead, according to diplomats who attended Mondays meeting of Nato Foreign Ministers in Brussels. Herr Helmut Schmidt, the West German Chancellor, apparently ended his recent visit to Washington convinced of this.

The Reagan Administration has long argued that the pipeline will make West Europe dangerously dependent on the Soviet Union. EEC countries say it would be very wrong for the U.S. to use the present situation to destroy the pipeline.

Lord Carrington, British Foreign Secretary, has compared the importance of the pipeline to Europeans with the effect on U.S. farmers of banning grain sales to the Soviet Union.

General Electric and Caterpillar have been the major U.S. corporate casualties of the sanctions, but yesterday there were some indications that the U.S. position on sanctions may be less absolute than initially indicated.

Western countries are still confused about the precise effects the sanctions will have on some U.S. concerns and what action by non-U.S. companies would be considered to undermine the American sanctions.

In Scotland, John Brown Engineering is known to be able to complete six of the 21 gas turbines ordered by the Soviet Union despite the halting of supply of rotors, blades and nozzles from General Electric.

Western countries hope to be able to announce a composite package of sanctions against Poland and the Soviet Union within a month. Officials will meet next week in Brussels to discuss the package.

KGB Tightens Screws on Ukraine
From the desk of Paul Belien on Sun, 2006-01-01 18:39
ukraine-massacre.jpg

In the 1930s Russia robbed Ukraine of its food supplies. The Kremlin deliberately created a food shortage. Ukrainian grain was collected and stored in grain elevators that were guarded by the Soviet army and secret police units (the NKVD, the predecessor of the KGB) while Ukrainians were starving in the immediate area. The result of the man-made famine of 1932-33 was the death of 7 million people. The famine was instigated by the Russians to break the spirit of the Ukrainians and force them into collectivisation and submission to Moscow. Let us do it again, Vladimir Putin, a former officer of the KGB, the Soviet Gestapo, and a worthy successor to Josef Stalin, said today.

The criminals who ruled Russia under the Soviet regime, and who bankrupted not only their own country but the whole of Eastern Europe, are still in charge in Moscow. Today, Russias state-run gas company Gazprom has cut gas supplies to Ukraine. The cut is the result of Russias unilateral decision to raise the gas price for Ukraine from 50$ to 230$ per 1,000 cubic metres of gas. Ukraine, still recovering from 70 years of Soviet occupation, is unable to pay this price and proposed a compromise of 110$, but Moscow wants to punish Ukraine because its politicians are not submissive enough to the Kremlin. Gazprom charges the Moscow-friendly dictatorship in Belarus (another country run by a former KGB agent) only 47$ per 1,000 cubic metres of gas. Armenia and Georgia are charged 110$, Romania 280$ and the EU on average 240$. According to the Kremlin, nations that want to be free have to pay the price of the free nations.

Last week Andrei Illarionov resigned as Mr Putins economic advisor. Mr Illarionov, who never collaborated with the former Communist regime, is an honest man. He accused the Kremlin of using gas as a weapon. Last week Ukraine, which depends heavily on Russian gas, tried to find a new gas supplier and approached Turkmenistan. Unfortunately, Turkmenistan is also run by former KGB criminals. Gazprom thwarted the Ukrainian plan by buying Turkmen gas stocks itself, at a price of... 65$ per 1,000 cubic metres.

Ukraine is dependent on Russia for 30% of its gas supplies. Western Europe, however, is dependent for the gas that it buys in Russia on pipelines running through Ukraine. Consequently Gazprom cannot simply cut all supplies to Ukraine. It has reduced the supplies to the pipeline by 15%, which is the percentage of the total volume that is used by Ukraine. If it wants to do so Kiev can tap into the Russian supplies to the West in order to secure its own gas supplies. The Russians have warned the Ukrainians that if they do so, they will be considered to be thieves. Western Europe is concerned, too.

Some EU countries rely heavily on Russian gas. Germany, for example, gets about 30% of its gas supplies from Russia, which makes it as dependent on Russian gas as Ukraine. If Kiev uses the gas for its own needs, to prevent Ukrainians freezing to death through Putins actions as they starved to death through the actions of his predecessor Stalin eight decades ago, it is Germany that will be left in the cold. On Wednesday EU gas industry experts will meet in Brussels to discuss the crisis.

It is easy to see what would have happened today if the gas pipeline that the Russians and Germans are planning to build on the Baltic seabed had already been completed. This pipeline, which is to be ready by 2010, will enable the Russians to deliver gas directly to Germany, bypassing all countries in between. It will allow Mr Putin to reassert Russian dominance over the whole of Eastern and Central Europe. It is time that the West sees Putin for what he really is: the new Stalin. If the Baltic pipeline gets built it will mean the end of freedom and democracy in Eastern Europe. Again the West, as it did earlier in Yalta, will have sold out the East to the Russian bear.

Today, January 1, 2006, Russia also takes over the chairmanship of the G8 group of industrial nations for the first time in history. This provides Mr Putin, the executioner of Ukraine, with an opportunity to emphasise Russias role in international affairs. Though the Russian economy is peanuts compared to those of the US, Canada, Japan, Germany, France, Britain and Italy, it has been admitted into the club of developed democracies because Russia has enough oil and gas to keep Western Europe supplied for years to come. Some US Senators have argued that Russia should not have been allowed in as a member. What is happening today shows that they are right.
 

 
 
If the Ukrain is a major point of transport, seems like a lose-lose scenario for all. Pretty testy situation.

Ukraine can siphon off gas if it is forced to, but Russia cannot afford to play this game for long, they need the $$$ too much. Best thing US/EU could do, back Ukraine and find other sources, then Ukraine could demand removal of Russian pipes or they will confiscate them.
 
 
Kathianne, it's sure that Moscow has still in mind the past and the soviet Empire. They think that the eastern Europe is under russian's domination.

But fortunatly, even in Russia some people think that Ukraine and Russia are friends, and that the crisis is not a good thing for the 2 countries

What other sources? There are also other bigger markets for Russian gas, China for one. I don't think the Ukraine is in much of a position to play hardball at the moment either, should be interesting to see how things unfold.

They are getting less than 30% from Russia, they can pay the prices of S. America or Mid-East, still probably close to what Russia is demanding, but they will deliver a serious blow. On top of that, Russia is playing 'hardball' on Ukrainian soil, never a smart idea.

And like I said, there are other markets needing Russian gas too.

I also fail to see how the Ukraine has become such a European super power as of late, if others are concerned about their access to Russian gas via the Ukraine, sure but are they? Western Europe can much more easily afford to import gas from elsewhere, moreso than the Ukraine.
 
 
Knew this would happen:

By JUDITH INGRAM, Associated Press Writer1 hour, 33 minutes ago

Russia's state-controlled natural gas monopoly on Monday accused Ukraine of diverting about $25 million worth of Russian gas intended for other European countries, a day after Moscow halted deliveries to Kiev in a price dispute.

Ukraine in turn accused Russia of trying to undermine its economy, calling for a resumption of gas price negotiations, this time including international experts.

Russia's OAO Gazprom halted gas deliveries to Ukraine on Sunday after Kiev balked at paying quadruple the amount it previously paid for Russian gas, which accounts for about a third of the consumption in the country of 48 million people.

Gazprom supplies about one-quarter of the gas consumed in Europe. Most of that goes through pipes that cross Ukraine and the dispute has raised worries of widespread supply disruptions throughout much of the continent.

The only gas now being put into pipelines headed for Ukraine is intended for European customers, the company said.

Several countries reported problems Monday. Hungary, Poland and Austria all reported that gas piped to them from Russia through Ukraine had slowed down by between 14 and 40 percent.

The former Soviet republic of Moldova, which neighbors Ukraine, has not received Russian gas supplies for two days, Russia's RIA-Novosti news agency reported. It said Moldova had not signed a 2006 contract with Gazprom, and that Moldovan President Vladimir Voronin had complained that the Russian price was too high.

Like Ukraine, Moldova has sought to orient itself away from Russia and toward the West.

Gas prices rose marginally on Monday, although there was little to indicate the dispute between Russia and Ukraine was affecting prices.

Gazprom deputy chairman Alexander Medvedev said Ukraine had siphoned off about 100 million cubic meters of gas on Sunday alone, worth about $25 million.

"If the theft will continue at such a tempo, then the value of the stolen goods will be extremely significant," he told reporters.

Gazprom has invited the Switzerland-based goods inspection and testing company SGS to record how much gas is entering Ukraine's pipeline network.

Ukrainian Prime Minister Yuriy Yekhanurov on Sunday denied Ukraine was siphoning off gas, saying "we are not using a single cubic meter of Russian gas." Ukraine's Fuel and Energy Minister Ivan Plachkov repeated the denial Monday, Interfax reported.

"There has been no unauthorized diversion of gas. Ukraine is using its own gas; gas from underground stores and gas from Turkmenistan in strict compliance with the signed contract," Interfax quoted Plachkov as saying.

Turkmenistan is Ukraine's single-largest supplier of gas.

Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko spoke with Turkmen leader Saparmurat Niyazov on Monday and his office reported that Niyazov had "once again" confirmed the two countries' gas supply contract. The head of Ukraine's Naftogaz state gas company, Alexei Ivchenko, flew to Turkmenistan on Monday for talks, Yushchenko's office said.

Naftogaz spokesman Eduard Zaniuk declined to comment Monday on the drop in supplies to Gazprom's customers to the West.

Ukraine lashed back at Russia late Sunday, accusing Moscow of following "a scenario aimed at economic pressure and blackmail and ultimately at undermining the stability of the Ukrainian economy and foiling Russian gas deliveries to consumers in EU countries," the Foreign Ministry said.

Yushchenko on Sunday also denounced Russia for imposing "obvious economic pressure on Ukraine." Relations between Russia and Ukraine have been chilly since Yushchenko came to power a year ago and vowed to move the country out of Russia's sphere of influence.

In Washington, State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said such an abrupt gas stoppage "creates insecurity in the energy sector in the region and raises serious questions about the use of energy to exert political pressure."

Gazprom has demanded that Ukraine start paying $230 per 1,000 cubic meters of gas, which the company says is in line with world market rates. Ukraine paid $50 per 1,000 cubic meters last year.

Ukraine says such a huge leap would cripple the country's economy, which relies strongly on energy-intensive heavy industries. It has not objected to paying more but wants to phase the increase in gradually.

Supply problems to Europe could undermine Western trust in Russia's natural gas industry, one of the keystones of the country's economy, and tarnish Russia's stint as chairman of the Group of Eight, which formally started Sunday.

EU Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs said last week that Europe could cope with a temporary interruption to its gas supply. EU energy experts will meet Wednesday to examine the situation.

 

 
 
 
And like I said, there are other markets needing Russian gas too.

I also fail to see how the Ukraine has become such a European super power as of late, if others are concerned about their access to Russian gas via the Ukraine, sure but are they? Western Europe can much more easily afford to import gas from elsewhere, moreso than the Ukraine.
 
I agree about Europe, which is where Russia is running into a $$$ problem. Europe will not do without oil. Ukraine can keep the oil from getting there, which really was USSR's doing. That is where Ukraine does have clout.

Russia continues to sell oil at loss to those 'former' satellites that have Russian dominated dictators leading them. They do NOT produce enough natural gas to supply Europe, Kyoto or not.

Russia Warned on Natural Gas Dispute
EU Plans Emergency Session to Address Sharp Drop in Gas Imports

By Peter Finn
Washington Post Foreign Service
Monday, January 2, 2006; 10:39 AM

MOSCOW, Jan. 2 -- Several European countries reported sharp drops Monday in the level of natural gas they are receiving from Russia as a dispute over pricing between the state-controlled Gazprom company and Ukraine threatened to damage Russia's reputation with its European customers as much as it hurts Ukraine. Russian natural gas destined for Western Europe transits a pipeline in Ukraine, and a reduction in the amount of gas entering the system from Russia, which was designed to only affect Ukraine, has led to reductions of up to 40 percent in supplies reaching Austria, Italy, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia -- all members of the European Union (EU) -- as well as Romania and Croatia.

Officials in Germany, which is about to embark on a multi-billion dollar pipeline project with Gazprom, which will increase the country's already heavy dependence on Russian natural gas, cautioned the Kremlin that it risked being seen as an unreliable energy partner. And a government minister reminded Russia that as chairman of the Group of Eight leading industrialized countries, which it assumed Monday, it should act responsibly. "Thirty percent of our gas comes from Russia at the moment. That should be increased," Germany's Economy Minister Michael Glos told German radio. "But it can only be increased if we know that deliveries from the East are dependable. One should naturally act responsibly."

Similar comments echoed across Europe.

"I think Russia now will be mindful of its reputation as a secure energy supplier," said British Energy Minister Malcolm Wicks in an interview on BBC radio. And in France,Le Monde newspaper said in an editorial that "in the heart of winter, Vladimir Putin turns off the faucet that permits 50 million Ukrainians to heat themselves and make their economy run."

The European Union will hold an emergency meeting on the issue Wednesday.

Gazprom officials, scrambling to explain a strategy that has begun to rebound, accused Ukraine of stealing gas destined for other European customers. The company cut gas supplies to Ukraine after the country's authorities rejected a four-fold, immediate price increase. Gazprom insists that it is continuing to pump enough gas to meet the supplies of other European countries.

Germany's stance doesn't seem to leave a lot of wiggle room. Good - that's the way it ought to be. This is no time for sappy socialist sentimentality, a la Le Monde. Russia has a lot at stake here; she can vent her pique at Ukraine, or she can behave responsibly - with an eye toward the future.

But Schroeder sold them out. Interesting developments:

PUTIN FOLDS FOR NOW - BUT NOT BEFORE SHOWING THE RIPPLE EFFECT OF THE NATURAL GAS FIGHT

Thankfully, Russia appears to be backing down a bit in its fight with Ukraine over natural gas prices.

There's a silver lining to Putin using the the state-owned company and its natural gas supplies in a raw attempt to influence Ukranian politics - it's a great clarifier. Please, Mr. President, no more "I looked in his eyes and saw the soul of a good man." The man's a power-hungry thug and felt poisoning Yushchenko's soup wasn't enough. We know what we're dealing with now. We cannot trust Putin.

Which is why we cannot trust Russia to protect our safety or interests in Iran. They can meet, and consider proposals, but we should not be fooled into thinking that Russian intervention will mitigate the threat of an Iranian nuclear arsenal.

(It's also why we should conclude that once and for all that Gerhard Schroeder is corrupt scum, who couldn't wait to jump into bed with Putin and his gas interests.)

I should note that for a while there, it appeared that the fight was going to have an impact on my supply of electricity:

Turkey, which depends heavily on Russia for natural gas, gets its supplies via two routes. One is the western route, which runs through Ukraine, Moldova, Romania and Bulgaria. The other is a conduit running under the Black Sea between the two countries, known as the Blue Stream pipeline. At maximum capacity the western pipeline transports 14 billion cubic meters of gas annually.

Experts warned that the negative effects of the cutoff in Russian gas were likely to be felt in Turkey soon, although state-run oil and gas company BOTAŞ said there would be no shortage of gas due to Russia's decision to cut supplies to Ukraine.

The problem [between Russia and Ukraine] has had no negative effect so far on the Balkan Transit Pipeline, BOTAŞ said in a statement.

The company added that, to avoid a possible shortage, it had bought large amounts of gas prior to Russia's cutoff of supplies to Ukraine and had kept storage at maximum levels in main conduits.

The western route supplies gas mostly for households and power plants in Turkey's northwest. Experts say Russia's cutoff of gas to Ukraine may lead to a reduction in the volume of gas supplied to Turkey.

With Russia cutting the gas supplies to Ukraine, Moldova, Romania and Bulgaria will rapidly start stocking gas that runs through the western pipeline. That will decrease the amount of gas coming to Turkey, Gökhan Bildacı, former director-general of BOTAŞ, told the Turkish Daily News.

Any decline in the amount of natural gas could negatively affect power production and lead to electricity cuts as well, as the region has a number of power plants that uses natural gas to produce electricity.

Bildacı said the adverse effects of Russia's cutoff were likely to be felt in northwestern Turkey as early as Monday night.

Now, the power was on all last night, at least in my neighborhood. And brief blackouts have been common all year long.

UPDATE: Looking around the blogosphere, Barking Moonbat Warning System wonders if Germany will be reconsidering phasing out nuclear power based on this near-miss with a heating crisis.

Stephen Green compares Russia to another Rocky sequel.

Brusselsjournal has a detailed, lengthy post on "Russia's Ugly Show." The sharp conclusion: "Schröder... intends to go down in history as the man who sold out Berlin to Moscow... Seeing as Russia has apparently remained under the political control of former agents of the previous communist regime, such as KGB veteran Putin, it is imperative that Ukraine be brought into NATO."
 

 
 
Ah, well - when a jackass flies, I guess you can't condemn it for not staying up very long...
 
 
 
Ah, well - when a jackass flies, I guess you can't condemn it for not staying up very long...
 

Let's see what was accomplished:

1. Ukraine didn't 'knuckle under.'
2. Europe needs the oil.
3. Russia needs the $$$ even more than Europe needs the oil.
4. The world is now on notice of the true gist of Putin.
5. The world should thank Putin for showing his true colors.  
 
 
  All things considered, we'll take it!

Like a flashy celebrity caught smacking his ex-girlfriend in public, Russias Vladimir Putin has had to retreat from his decision Sunday to blackmail Ukraine by cutting off the countrys natural gas supplies. Following an outcry from West Europeans, Russia resumed piping 100 percent of the required gas through Ukraine on Tuesday.

The lesson? Length of time autocratic Russia could put the screws to a neighbor in the imperial and Soviet era: decades. Length of time autocratic Russia can put the screws to that neighbor in an era of globalization: three days.

Just as Russia last year discovered it couldnt hand-pick a communist to serve as the Ukrainian president, it cannot now use gas prices to punish Ukraine for asserting its political independence. The broader lesson for Russias neighbors -- or any expansionist bullys neighbors -- is that you must integrate in the region beyond you, economically and politically, so that you spend as little time as possible with the bully behind closed doors.

Of course, behind the politics of the gas shutoff is a pricing issue with some economic merit. Russias state-owned gas monopolist (and proxy foreign ministry) Gazprom has decided that if Ukraine is going to engage in independent-minded behavior, it will hike Ukraines gas prices to match West European prices rather than the prices enjoyed by Russian consumers and more Moscow-obedient ex-Soviet republics such as Belarus or Armenia.

Ukrainian negotiators say fine, hike them, but not by 400 percent in one day. (A price hike anywhere near double digits leads to government investigations in the West.) Russia says yes, 400 percent, Ukraine says no. Russia turns off the pipes. The Gazprom technique is tried-and-true: it was used to get Belarus into line several years ago. And to keep Turkmenistan in check, Russia has at times cut off Turkmen gas, which flows across Russian territory. The trouble is Russias gassy diplomacy with Ukraine has consequences that spill into Western Europe, whereas cries of gas blackmail on the frozen steppes of Belarus, where the still-Communist government is pro-Moscow, or cries of blackmail in Turkmenistan, which is isolated and land-locked, cant be heard for miles.

Globalization helps Ukraine. Almost all of the Russian natural gas used by Western Europe, 80 percent, comes through the same Ukrainian pipelines to which Russia cut supplies on Sunday. So within hours of the cut, Slovakia, Austria, and Germany further down the line were squealing: Their supplies were down, and supply disruptions to European industry could harm national economies. Ukraine, for its part, called for international mediation of the gas dispute at the Stockholm Arbitration Institute -- attempting a kind of globalization of its negotiations.

The Europeans were primed to react negatively to Russias move. They were already worried about the fact that theyre dependent on Russia for roughly 25% of their gas. Not only had they seen the Ukraine-Russia conflict simmer, with its threats of supply cuts, but Russia had tried to throw its monopolist weight around with them directly, too. Heres how:

- Russia wants to form a gas cartel. Russia, which together with Iran has 45 percent of the worlds natural gas, has since 2001 been instrumental in creating and strengthening an international Gas Exporting Countries Forum, and exploring the GECFs potential to be an OPEC-style cartel. The forum has no European or North American members, and has a majority of Middle-Eastern or rogue states.

- Russia fights the liberalization of gas markets and prices: Russia has sought to prevent European countries, which have pledged to liberalize their gas markets, from ending the use of destination clauses that forbid companies from reselling gas to a third party. Naturally, such clauses protect monopolists, keep prices high, and prevent new entrants into the market.

- Russia resists the development of a risk-managing market for natural gas: In the U.S. and Canada, gas exploration, gas pipelines, and gas delivery are largely privately owned. Gas prices are determined and supply risks are managed in functioning markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange. Russia, meanwhile, has reasserted control over its gas resources through state-owned Gazprom, and uses bilateral contracts that dont shelter the buyer from risk and that serve the interests of Gazprom. As a peculiar aside, Russia even hired German ex-Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, a socialist and no friend of market reforms, to carry its water at West European cocktail parties.

Given these Russian tendencies, the Europeans were primed to react negatively to Russias gas blackmail in Ukraine. President Vladimir Putins meddling in the Ukrainian elections last year, right under the nose of European election monitors, didnt help matters, either. In a sense, Ukraine is enjoying a new identity as a canary in the coalmine of Russian misbehavior.

That position wont necessarily last. Russian politicians are sure to go back to the drawing board for new, more stealthy ways to punish their wayward southern neighbor. And West Europeans dont have a terribly consistent record of caring about abusiveness outside their universe.

But in terms of gas politics, Russia has been exposed. If theres now a redoubling of effort by Ukraine and the West Europeans to find alternate sources of energy (nuclear, coal, electric, liquefied natural gas, gas from non-Russian pipelines), or to find financial instruments to hedge Russian price-setting if they cant actually wean themselves of Russian gas in the near term, then the politicians at Gazprom will have been duly punished. If the U.S. can do anything to assist this weaning, it ought to.

In an ideal world, Russia will lose the energy-blackmail arrow in its quiver. And that will be for the best.
 

 
 
I read somewhere that Russia pays Ukraine a contracted amount of money to run its pipelines across Ukraine's land. Ukraine has threatened to increase the amount of money it charges Russia to use its land for their pipelines by several hundred percent if Russia holds firm on excessive gas rate increases to Ukraine. Russia said Ukraine could not do this because it would be illegal (ha, ha, ha!), and right after that Russia started accusing Ukraine of stealing gas from its pipelines. Ukraine does have some leverage to use against Russia right now, but probably won't once the pipeline Russia and Germany intends to build on the floor of the Baltic Sea becomes a reality. Merkel and her administration should take a long hard look at any business plans Germany currently has on the table with Putin's Russia. Merkel, being a former resident of East Germany, should have first hand knowledge and experience in how KGB Russia does "business".
 
 
Take a look at this from Russia's perspective, you have an extremely valuable, extremely finite resource without which keeping the Russian people from freezing becomes a much harder task. If I were them I would hoard my gas and oil to myself and make it last as long as possible. And yes the $$$ is important but, given oil prices and the likely possiblity of peak oil hitting us soon, having a guaranteed supply of oil around for the next 50-60 years until alternative sources can take the full burden is essential for Russia's survival.
