Neil Patrick Harris
 
 
David Hyde Pierce! (Niles from Frasier).

He's so hawt, but now I can't really fantasize about him anymore because I can just imagine him going, 'uh, no, sorry, I'm gay'. :P
 
 
simon amstell, i still can't believe it!
 
 
People didn't think Fry and Norton were gay?

Fry i can maybe understand, but Norton? He's even gayer than Dale Winton.

Nah it wouldnt be the same if he was married, with a few sprogs. He would be dividing his awesomeness  
 
 
James may isn't gay, hes got a girl friend

also Neil Patrick Harris was quite a shocker
 
 
Russell T Davies was a shocker for me for some reason.

There were intense bisexuality rumors going around about Channing, so he may possibly be bisexual.

Dale Winton's gay?!?!?!  

On a more serious note, I was slightly surprised when I found out Derren Brown was gay, I'm sure he's made jokes about attractive girls before. BUT, it gave me ample opportunity to suggest that my friend, who is very very like Derren Brown in many ways, is gay. He doesn't like me doing that very much. I can't see why...

and guys you were surprised that Graham Norton was gay? seriously?
 
 
My friends were flabergasted when i told them scott mills was gay and said i was lying. Hm I guess Wentworth Miller suprised me a bit, and I didn't know about Derren Brown unil this thread, but im not exactly suprised
 
 
Derren Brown & Neil Patrick Harris.
 
 
Vin Diesel.
 
 
Sol Campbell and Martina Navratilova
 
 
Derren Brown and Stephen Fry, it all seems really obvious in hind sight.   I always suspected H from Steps though.  
 
 
1. Daniel Radcliffee???!!!
nobody told me  
and Lindsay Lohan..

If you watch the credits to Harold and Kumar you'll see he's credited as "Neil Patrick Harris... Neil Patrick Harris" instead of "Neil Patrick Harris... Himself". He wanted it that way because the character he plays is actually nothing like him.

It is kind of funny that he's typecast as an ultra-hetero sleazebag when he's actually gay. Barney isn't any less legendary just because the guy that plays him is gay.
 
 
If you think people are na√Øve now, it came as a shock to many people to find out Liberace was gay.

 

I mean!

Derren Brown was a surprise to me too.

I once heard a rumour from a friend that David Coulthard was gay, and that the girl friend thing is all staged so as to keep up his image. I'm not sure I believe that though.
 
 
Stephen Fry!

...It explains his obsession with T.S Elliot, though.
 
 
I'm pretty sure James May and Vin Diesel are not gay. I mean they could be for all we know, but if they are they're pretty deep in the closet.
 
 
Derren Brown surprised me.
 
 
Just thought I'd say (and I've only read the first page so it has probably been said)... James May isn't gay. He's been dating a woman called Sarah Frater for years. He might be in the closet, but I doubt it.
 
 
lol i just found out darren brown from this thread!
NOOO!

also Vin Diesel and Ian McKellen or whatever his name is.... GANDALF/MAGNETO

(also heath ledger and jake gilinhall shoked me aswell) (i cant spell names AT ALL!)

(i joke though, i know there not gay, they just like to pretend they are)
 
 
There's a lot of BS on this thread about who's gay. Don't know if they are jokes or not. Eminem, yeah right, he raps about 'faggots' all day long. Usher? Please. James May is not gay and others mentioned on here.

Anyway Mr T from police academy i've heard is gay and that surprised me. Still not 100% sure if it's true but there was a photo of him kissing a guy from the 80's or something.
 
 
I think people are mixing up responding to who is actually gay and who they believe are in the closet. I'll change the original post, and maybe make a thread about who people think are in the closet later.
 
 
Claire Balding. Completely hadn't realised!
 
 
Simon Amstell. Although more so upset than shocked. Not sure why though because now i know he's gay, it's really quite obvious..!
 
 
james may? wtf
 
 
Lindsay Lohan. But then again i think she is just a bit confused at the moment
 
 
Actually, when I think that Freddie Mercury was gay a part of my brain still goes "Does Not Compute". It became obvious, but when he was younger, I'd never have guessed. If I'd been alive, that is.

Seeing the way he behaves around Jenson, and a picture that was around at the end of last season of him and Dario, I wouldn't be surprised!
 
 
H from Steps, I honestly thought I was going to marry that man...

 
 
 
Elton John  

I jest, but the real surprise was Ian Mckellan I think. Or Ellen Degeneres.
 
 
Simon Amstell - the bloke who used to do popworld.

Although now i know - it kinda does make sense.

Well I never knew Derren Brown was gay until I saw this thread.

Angelina Jolie - although she's bi I was thinking what! but then when I think about the types of roles she has done I'm not too surprised now haha.. still she's hot stuff though, well, before she started looking skeletal.

He consorts with dark magic, what do you expect?

I was shocked to find out Boy George had sex with a man. It really ruined his friendly family style he used to come across with in the 90s. Very sad day  
 
 
How can people be surprised by Derren Brown?
You people need some gaydar, or you could make costly relationship mistakes!
 
 
I'm not sure about Ellen Page. I can't tell.

There are so many people that are being named- i don't know which ones to believe! lol
 
 
This thread is annoying. Too many people lying and making me think "wtf, [insert name] is gay?" to which I google and find out they aren't.

Well she's been with Sam Ronson for months. You don't commit to someone for that long if you're just attention-seeking.

Cynthia Nixon...
 
 
Sandi Toksvig! :O

And Scott Mills! What. The. Frig? I wanted to marry him  
 
 
I was surprised when I heard Stephen Fry was gay...same with John Barrowman.
And I guess it's surprising that Simon Amstell and Derren Brown are too...
James May is NOT gay, despite what his colleagues would have people believe...
 
 
Daniel Radcliffe, he may not have been outed, but he so is.
 
 
George Michael.

It was a major surprise when he flashed his willie at me in a public toilet.  
 
 
Jeremy Sheffield. My mum wouldn't believe me   (he's the guy from Holby City and the France/Britain car advert)
 
 
I just found about Stephen Fry    

I didn't realise about Pat Butcher either.

Queen Latifah and Wentworth Miller are not gay.

I was shocked when my friend told me Vin Diesel was gay too

They are! Queen Latifah (do not know her real name   ) has had a female partner for a number of years now, and wentworth miller is gay and has been seen out and about with his male partner many times.
Although of course neither of these two have confirmed it so believe what you want really.

His partner is called Sarah, so it's pretty safe to assume he's straight.

I know who Stephen K Amos is.... brilliant comedian  .

I was kinda stunned when i heard about him.

Also was surprised about Simon Amstell.
 
 
How do so many people not know that Stephen Fry is gay? Simon Amstell and Grahm Norton as well....!

I was surprised at Ian McKellan, personally. Never would have guessed!

haha sorry, i was shocked as well with Wentworth miller, but i sort of see it now! Although as i said it hasn't been confirmed so theres still a glimer of hope!
 
 
I loved watching Lion King and other Disney movies up until I was 7, therefore can you imagine that moment of shock that took hold of me when, at the age of 14, I read that Elton John was homosexual. I didn't even know what's a gay up until around 12-13.
Neil Patrick Harris is quite shocking, indeed. I don't think I'll be looking at him in the same way in 'How I Met Your Mother' now. haha
I think the same story goes for Freddy Mercury(as for Elton John), as I have also sung along to Queen songs.
 
 
Scott Mills
Simon Amstell
Bret Easton Ellis!!
The man that does the voiceovers for In The Night Garden. Which made me laugh btw because I was on the Wikipedia Index of gay celebrities and all the ones I recognised were like these dignified old men like Ian McKellen and Stephen Fry and stuff, and then the man that goes "Inky, plinky, pinky, plonk. Hello Ups-A-Daisy!". It was probably a be-there moment tbh.
 
 
Scott Mills :O Still can't believe it,he hides it well!
 
 
James May is straight

Derren Brown
Mark Gatiss

Do you remember the uproar over Will Young being gay? Lol
 
 
I only found out Whoopi Goldberg was gay last week on Wossy  
And I never knew Ian McKellen or Stephen Fry were gay either.

I feel na√Øve

My world was rocked to the core when i found out that NPH was gay. *Leave me, i must weep!*

As a rule, it generally is reliable.

Look under the personal life sections and it will normally say.

Cristiano Ronaldo. He's not 'out' yet, but just ******* look at him.

 
 
 
Raul Esparza, Neil Patrick Harris, Nathan Lane and David Starkey.
And as for the 'heavily-rumoured': Wentworth Miller and Lee Pace.
On a slightly-related topic: Did anyone see Stephen Fry on that Missing People thing yesterday? He's so thin now.
 
 
I was quite happy when i found out Simon Amstell is Gay!

In reply to the Stephen Fry thing, I saw him, and he doesn't look well...

Haha. Could say the same thing about David Beckham though. Pink nail varnish? And a sari?

I was surprised about Derren Brown, I only found out by looking at this thread. And I was surprised about Ian McKellen and Stephen Fry too, when I heard about them.

And Amelie Mauresmo! I suppose it's obvious, but I never saw it.
 
 
I'm sure there are many gay footballers - it's just difficult for them to be open about who they are cause football fans aren't famous for their tolerance and intellect.

The funniest thing I ever heard was when the older Ronaldo got caught in a hotel with three prostitutes, they were all transvestites.

That was hilarious. You can tell from the pictures that those women were obviously men at some time.

Still I bet his gf was pretty cheesed off.
 
 
Kevin Spacey

Simon Amstell is gay? That surprises me aswell.

Oh and he took a degree in English Lit. Guess Wentworth Miller is gay...

I was shocked about Stephen Fry but how I missed that one I don't know.

 

Yeah, he is. He as one of the hosts of London Gay Pride last year.
 
 
Graeme (Graham?) Norton.

Yes. He is. Honestly.
 
 
Will Young.  

I honestly can't spot these things. At least, not until someone points out why it actually is so obvious.  
 
 
WHoopi Goldberg?? I did not expect that, lol. Ive always wanted to just go up and hug her.. she seems hugable

This proves the contrary:  http://gossip.elliottback.com/is-wentworth-miller-gay/ 

If I had to believe one, I'd go for the man himself.
 
 
Elton John...I honestly thought he was just a hippie...I found out he was gay about 2 years ago!

I didn't realsie Derren Brown was gay until I read this thread; but it doesn't surprise me.

Hyacinth Bucket.

I wonder when Peter Andre will come out  
 
 
I heard something about Ste from Hollyoaks being gay.. but then I've also heard he's living with the girl who plays Michaela so maybe not?!! Unless they're just flatmates..

He had a boyfriend, before he got into a relationship with the actress from Step up.

Mark from Westlife - I had no idea. I was crushed  
 
 
Lord Peter Mandelson and Sir Ian McKellen.
 
 
Derren Brown and Simon Amstell.
 
 
Tony Blair and Margaret Thatcher.
 
 
I had absolutely no idea that Simon Amstell was gay!
 
 
My friend was very surprised when she found out Graham Norton was gay... I really do not know how she missed that one.

I had absolutely no idea that Simon Amstell was gay!

Me too!
 
 
Dick Cheney's daughter.
 
 
Gok Wan
 
 
Ian Mckellen? Noooooooo...  

Derren Brown... Will Young... Whoopi Goldberg... Missy Elliot... Jodie Foster.

Ellen and Portia de Rossi  

Kevin Spacey  
 
 
David Starkey and Derren Brown.

Although, I wasn't "surprised". You see, not every gay man has to be riding a pink pony. Likewise, not every gay women has to look like a Pat Butcher wannabe. Stereotypes are called stereotypes for a reason.  
 
 
Whoopi Goldberg isn't gay.
 
 
William Shakespeare.

R.L Stevenson

Dale Whinton  

Will Young

John-Paul McQueen  
 
 
Bruce Willis
 
 
Derren Brown was a bit shocking when I first heard it.

And I only just found out about Evan Davis. My sister's friend's uncle...

Also, since when did Pat Butcher resemble the lesbian stereotype???
 
 
I was really surprised about the guy who plays Aaron Samuels in Mean Girls. He just did not seem to be the gay type! I was pretty gutted tbh.
 
 
Just to clear things up

MR T isn't gay
James May isn't gay
Vin deisel isn't gay
Shaun Michael scot isn't gay

stop making things up
 
 
Derren Brown - I found out from this thread infact.

REALLY?!
i could so imagine him with a girlfriend. She'd be tall, slim, with dark hair and maybe glasses.
This has totally ruined this image.

It is kind of funny that he's typecast as an ultra-hetero sleazebag when he's actually gay. Barney isn't any less legendary just because the guy that plays him is gay.

 

He is still quite legendary indeed. It always shocks me to think he is gay though, just because of Barneys lifestyle. Once you take a good look at his character he does seem quite gay however...

On another note, how incredibly awesome is Barneys apartment  

(from a fair few pages back, I got so far and felt the need to respond...)
 
 
Evan Davis! soooooo gutted!  

Also, Derren Brown!  

And Missy Elliot, really???  

David Starkey, Ian McKellen, Dumbledore!   I all knew about before this thread but was surprised when I heard!

I have obviously just over-thought that way too much, I'm going to go sleep now..

I do know that he lost his virginity when he was 26 though.

I never knew about Derren Brown or Simon Amstell until I read this thread :\ can't say I'm really shocked about Derren Brown, but I'd never thought that Simon Amstell was gay.
I actually only found out about Stephen Fry a few weeks ago, didn't surprise me at all though

Hahahaha we should photoshop a picture of "her" and him together
I once photoshopped a picture of me and david tennant together but that's because.
uhm
 
 
Why does it matter?
 
 
I had no clue about Pam St Clement!!! (Pat from Eastenders)
 
 
Oh that woman from Neighbours (or Home and Away, its Australian either way)

She has short hair, susan I think it is, I just never thought of her as being gay!

I personally think thats a flaw proof plan to convince him!

Now, if it was anyone other than David Tennant, slightly weird, but perfectly reasonably considering he is... Well, him!

Mmmmmmmmm
He was even my facebook picture once because I couldn't find an attractive picture of myself
Ohh he makes me all...
eeeeeee

:P
 
 
I lost count of just how many times I've said Wentworth Miller is gay.

Imagine my suprise when I found out that Chase Crawford from Gossip Girl was gay!
 
 
I think you're thinking of Alan Carr, the slightly more camper, buck toothed comedian.
 
 
Scott Mills...I could not believe it! In fact, I still don't. Scott's not gay. No.

Kristian Digby  

Michael French! I was absolutely shocked to read that he was gay/bi, I never would have guessed!

I agree. Was shocked to see her with Sam Ronson; didn't think it would last. To be honest though, LiLo was rumoured to have frittered away $$$$$$, so thought it might be a publicity stunt at first but it lasted quite a while. Confused little lass I reckon.
 
 
Seriously Google some of these rumours, most of them are just rumours anyway!
 
 
i heard that Vin Diesel was gay but turns out that was just a rumour

In fact, I had no idea most of the people mentioned on this thread were gay. Ian McKellen, Wentworth Miller, Simon Amstell, Pat from Eastenders, Derren Brown, Aaron Samuels from Mean Girls, Jodie Foster, Scott Mills. I clearly have no gaydar. I knew that already though.

I was shocked about John Barrowman (I did know that one). Oh, and the guy from Gossip Girl.

I am sure that the guy from gossip girl one was just a rumour, unless it's been confirmed since I heard about it. and Aaron Samuels, that is rather surprizing! As quite a few others I didn't expect Derren Brown as being gay for ages.  
 
 
Jodie Foster.

My favourite actor since I was about 9, and when I found out, I was really suprised.

Oh no, really? In my head, he is always the sweet type who is a bit shy when it comes to stuff like that, and wants to only do it with people who "mean something to him". Don't spoil my perfected image!
 
 
This thread just proves how gullible people are.  
Keynes, Greta Garbo, Evan Davis & Foucalt all surprised me.

I know!! Not even sure if it's true, just something I saw on this thread. Seems too random to be made up though. There's something so upsetting about finding out a really attractive male celebrity is gay, even though there's a virtually negligable chance you'll ever even meet them!

Urgh, I agree, but I think Tate was still worse. I think that the new girl (have no idea waht her name is, was Zoe in Eastenders?) might be interesting though. wish she had held out longer before they kissed though, where is the tension? Pah!
 
 
the guy from never mind those buzzcocks. i rly thought he was straight as..... but u know...........

Yeah fair point, but at least she'll give him a "run for his money" so to speak

We have totally highjacked this thread yanno   Which is precisely why I'm off to go sleep, night  
 
 
This thread has been a revelation - Simon Amstell and Neil Patrick Harris were shocking!

You should make a big list on the OP lol. I don't know what the title would be though...

In Little Britain I always thought Mat Lucas was the straight one and the other guy was gay, turns out its the other way round. Just goes to show.

If I had to believe one, I'd go for the man himself.

 

Aah but your article was January 2007, mine was April 2007.
 
 
Oo I tell you who else I was surprised about - George Michael! I was gobsmacked! And gutted   Haha, looking back, I don't know why it was such a shock!

I didn't think Wentworth Miller was gay, but then I guess it's not that much of a surprise...actually, no, I go with my original thought, it is a bit of a surprise!

And Channing Tatum?! When I first read that on here I was like, no way! But then I thought, I looked him up after seeing him in Stop-Loss, in which he was really macho, and saw some of his modelling pics and thought, hmm, these don't look entirely straight!

He's not really a celebrity, but for some reason I was surprised the guy who plays Elliott in Hollyoaks is gay.

Phil from House Invaders was another shocker! He's a big strong builder, I can't believe he's gay, and he's with this horrible weedy bloke!

I was surprised Portia De Rossi was gay, and by the fact she got with Ellen Degenerate.

Who else...Derren Brown...I was really icked out that Pat Butcher's gay, that's just gross.

I heard about ste too, reckon its true
 
 
Dusty Springfield

I only found out today, my mum read it in the paper.

Also I was shocked at Derren Brown but when I told my boyfriend he was just like. Though so.

=/

It is kind of funny that he's typecast as an ultra-hetero sleazebag when he's actually gay. Barney isn't any less legendary just because the guy that plays him is gay.

 

You're telling me that the guy in this costume is gay?

 

I had to look up what you meant when talking about Barney. I've never seen How I Met Your Mother although loads of people tell me it's a great series.
 
 
okay so to clarify...the guy from step up..channing or something
1 not gay
2 bi, used to have a boyf
3 is now dating the girl from step up2?
his love life is a tad confusing.
 
 
I don't know why you're shocked that any of these people are gay. Even Derren Brown is a bit camp. But then again, it is possible to have gay people who don't fit the stereotypes. Lots of them.

Did he really used to have a bf? Huh!

No, he's engaged to the girl he played opposite in the first one.

It seems to be a point of considerable arguement, Bubbles.
 
 
Pat Butcher, and the woman that plays Hyacinth Bucket in "Keeping up Appearances"

i was then even more surprised when i found they were a couple

Me too. He was rumoured to be with Luke MacFarlane, he was in 'OVER THERE' a series about Iraq and played Dim. He doesn't even look gay.
 
 
Aaron Samuels (mean girls) is apparently going out with the guy from Kyle XY

Lady Gaga :O
