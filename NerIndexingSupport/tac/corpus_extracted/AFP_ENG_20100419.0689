Japanese automaker Mitsubishi Motors Corp (MMC) said Monday it faced a 900
million dollar claim for damages from its former distributor in Egypt, as it
slashed its operating profit forecast.

Japan's fourth-largest automaker said Cairo-based distributor Masria Co. is
claiming the money alleging Mitsubishi was in breach of contract when it
terminated its agreement with the company.

Masria said Mitsubishi's "termination notice lacks reasonable grounds and
demands an extension of the distribution contract", with the claim representing
56 percent of the group's net assets, the automaker said in a statement.

Mitsubishi said the complaint was "unfounded" because it gave Masria notice "six
months prior to the expiration date of the distribution contract", adding that
it "will strenuously fight this lawsuit."

It added that it did not expect the lawsuit to affect its business results.

Separately, the carmaker slashed its expected operating income for the year to
March by 54 percent to 13.8 billion yen (150.36 million dollars), saying that
earlier cost reduction estimates proved overly optimistic.

Mitsubishi said it revised down the forecasts "due to factors such as a drop in
sales volume as well as the company being unable to realise some of its planned
cost reductions".

It also lowered its net profit forecast to 4.7 billion yen from five billion and
revenue to 1.44 trillion yen to 1.5 trillion.

For the nine months to December, Mitsubishi announced a net loss of 25.7 billion
yen, hit by the economic downturn and a stronger yen.

Mitsubishi Motors will publish its final annual results on April 27. In
2008-2009, it had suffered a net loss of 54.88 billion yen.
