 
 
Detroit was Hockeytown!!! <snicker>
 
 
Anyone think it'll be a sweep? I think it will go 5. Cindy Crawford is good. Osgood got a lot of luck last night. Wings could have easily lost that game. It sure is a game of inches.

But it is the Wings year, no question about it. We are the Yankees of Hockey.

I don't even like hockey until this time of year and ONLY if the Wings are in it. But it is nice to rule something. Do any of you have a sport that you feel your city dominates at? I already gave NY that for baseball.

Which city thinks they rule at Football? I'd say New England or Dallas.

How about Basketball? I'd say LA or Boston could make a case. Not Chicago because they only won in the Jordan era. I've seen Boston & LA win now and in the past. Because of Magic Johnson & Kobe/Shaq eras, I'd give it to LA.
 
 
Yankees are the best because they buy the best players every year in the off season, and they have been struggling recently with the AL east getting even more competitive some how.

I hate the Steelers, but they are the best team in the NFL.

Go wings
 
 
I'm a Pens fan but I have to give it to the red wings they are tough,
baseball, Yankees is usually the pick but lately they haven't been doing so good

now football, It has to be the Steelers
you say New England they have only been good or dominate since Brady got his start
and Dallas ha ha ha please they haven't won a playoff game in I think 10 years

People used to say Detroit was the best for the same reason as the Yankees. The owner spared no expense. But then the salary cap came and I thought the Red Wings would no longer dominate, yet somehow they still do.

I Steelers. I hadn't thought about them as being "America's Team". Remember Dallas said they were? I disagree. Yea, Steelers is a good choice.

Yankees are still competitive every year/decade. They are held to a higher standard than every other team.

Atlanta Braves could have taken over the baseball title when they had Glavin and Smoltz and it seemed like they were great every year for 10 years, but they didn't win enough. Making the playoffs every year doesn't mean that much to me unless you win a lot. This is why the Piston's aren't a dynasty. They only won in 2004. Had they won one more they would have gotten a lot more respect. Even though they made the finals or Eastern finals for what seemed like 10 years, you still don't put them in the same category as a LA or Boston or even Chicago Bulls. Maybe Chicago. We won in 89 and 90 and 2004. They won 6 in between. I'd have to give the edge to the Bulls.
 
 
I'm not a huge hockey fan, simply because we don't have hockey here in Indy.

But,,,,,,,,,when I think of the "Hockey Team Legends" these teams come to mind:

Pittsburgh Penguins

Boston Bruins

Detroit Red Wings

As a Bruins fan I'd say thank you. But as a long time hockey fan you're nukkin futts for not placing the Montreal Canadiens... at the top of this list.

You know what's funny? I don't even know what team to associate Wayne Gretzke to because he was such a whore.  

Most greats like him you associate with a team.

The Red Wings sucked the years Gretzke was great so I didn't watch a lot too. That might have something to do with me not knowing who he played for.

Gretzky's team was the Edmonton Oilers. Sealy is being a bobo pretending that Gretzky's late career move to the LA Kings somehow cheapens the greatness of The Great One.

The Montreal Canadiens are the team that has won the Stanley Cup 23 times. Second only in big 4 titles to the Yankees 26 WS wins and something like 13 more than the Red Wings.

I thought Gretzky moved around more than that. And I didn't know he played for the Oilers.

And I dind't know Montreal won that many times. WOW!!!

When's the last time they won?

1993

And at 16 years without the Cup this is by far their worst slump. Prior to 1993 the most they'd ever gone without winning the Cup was 7 years.
 
 
btw: Gretzky did play briefly for the Blues and then a couple years with the Rangers after he was waaaay over the hill. But I don't hold that against him.

No. Gretzky was actually good. One of the best in fact.

Favre wouldn't make my top 20 regardless of his stats. Why? Because I've seen him play.

he had some awesome players with him in Edmonton,
I never went towards Orr I always wondered what Mario's numbers would have been

Isn't that back when hockey was different? I heard something about how if Gretzky was playing today, he wouldn't be as dominant.

Even if you disagree, what am I talking about? They say it was an easier game to play or less hitting or something like that? And thats why no one will ever break Gretzky's records?

Please explain and let me know if you agree or not.

Maybe you could start a hockey poll? Put Mario on there too! I don't know enough about all the players to do one, just the "stars and legends" of hockey.
 
 
In no particular order, the greatest hockey players of all time are Wayne Gretzky, Mario Lemeiux and Bobby Orr. It is impossible IMO, to place any one of them above another. And nobody else comes anywhere close to the conversation.

A) This is the first time I've heard anything quite so ludicrous.

B) Did I mention it's ludicrous?  

Yeah, Gretzky would've really suffered if he had to play without a red-line.  

As for less hitting then?   ? Only in opposite world.

Fuck you Gordy Howe isn't even mentioned? You're clueless.

I will give you Wayne Grezky, even though he was a pussy in a pussy era, but then its Howe and THEN it is Orr and/or Lemeiux.

I'm seriously fucking amazed you would leave Howe out. Fuck that. Now I'm being serious. Ask anyone who knows hockey.
 
 
He's mixing up the fact that they changed blue line rules recently and how every announcer says this when comparing a new talent to an old favorite. They always refer to it in football because the players are bigger and the game has evolved.
 
 
Yea I dunno hockey that well and Gordy Howe is one of maybe 5 players I know by name that aren't currently playing

You're obviously biased by your love of the Red Wings. Not that I can blame you since I still insist on keeping Larry Bird on my short list of BBall greats.  

Gordy absolutely does not belong on the short list with the other three. YOU ask anyone that actually knows hockey.
 
 
I would have to say my friend's dad is knowledgable on the subject considering he played semi pro for the Baltimore skipjacks or something like that. He's the one that made me watch a biography of gordy when I was 13.

I did a very quick google and found this:

In this playoff run, malkin has 16 points in his last 6 games, quite an impressive feat. If you extrapolate that to a full season, that would be 219 pts in 82 games. Gretzky's single season record is 217 pts. That means that gretzky averaged what malkin did over the last six games over a FULL SEASON. (note, he had 4 200pt seasons)

Granted gretzky played in a different time, when his opponents were not nearly as good as the competition is now.

Where were the russians during Gretzky's time?

And how many teams when he played? Can you say watered down? And he didn't play any defense.

And then I found this:

With a spectacular backhand shot, Wayne Gretzky surpasses his hockey hero, Gordie Howe's record and becomes the NHL's all-time leading scorer.

 Gretzky smashes his hockey hero's record - CBC Archives 

Just ask Orr:

In 1998, The Hockey News released their List of Top 100 NHL Players of All-Time and listed Howe third overall behind Wayne Gretzky and Bobby Orr. Of the list, Orr was quoted as regarding Howe as the greatest player.[2]

Ask Bobby Orr. You're fucking mad. You just don't know. Look into his career before you speak.

I give the other guys mad mad mad props!!!!

But to not even have Gordy on the list, means you are just a jackass. LOL.

Look at me. You really got me mad. And I don't even like hockey that much.

Seriously, it isn't for my love of Detroit. Everyone knows Gordy is at least in the top 5.

AT LEAST!!! I've give Wayne #1. I'll even give Orr #2. Hell, I'll even give Lemieux number #3 even though I disagree. But if I'm trying not to argue with you, I'll be the bigger man and give you those 3. But then there is Gordy at number 4.

Which is bullshit. He's number 2 or 3!!!!

Eat it Mani! He's just trying to piss me off.  
 
 
Settle down Beavis.  

You're acting like I said Howe sucked or something. I'd place him at the top of the list of everyone else, I just do not believe he's in the same class with the other three. His most impressive attribute was his longevity. He certainly didn't change the entire way players play the defensive position like Orr and he never came close to dominating the game like the other two.

I agree the Lakers have probably surpassed the Celtics as the greatest NBA dynasty due to winning in so many eras. And if people in LA want to root for a lousy team, they also have the Clippers too. So there's something for everybody.

As for my city, we used to be the best in Indoor Soccer, our San Diego Sockers won 10 titles in 11 years in NASL/MISL Indoor Soccer back in the 1980s and 90s. Unfortunately the sport has faded back into oblivion, but it was big for a brief time in the late 80s. Its a shame since it was much more exciting than outdoor soccer (and we actually ruled at a professional sport!).
 
 
 
 
I'm not a huge hockey fan, simply because we don't have hockey here in Indy.

But,,,,,,,,,when I think of the "Hockey Team Legends" these teams come to mind:

Pittsburgh Penguins

Boston Bruins

Detroit Red Wings

 

As a Bruins fan I'd say thank you. But as a long time hockey fan you're nukkin futts for not placing the Montreal Canadiens... at the top of this list.

 

Um, when did the Bruins win the last time? To call them some sort of great dynasty is ludicris. Over the long time span, of course, Montreal has long been the standard for greatest team, but I don't know how much longer they can milk that one. They haven't won since 1993, and I think they only one once during the 1980s. The vast majority of their titles were during the period when there were only six teams. 4 and out in Round one this year is not very impressive and for many years they didn't even make the post-season. If they don't at least make the finals in the next say five years, I don't think they will still deserve to be put in the same sentence as other dynasties in other sports. Je suis desole, mais on n'est plus une dynastie si on ne gagne jamais.

That's an obscure thing to brag about. You're in Cali, so I give you the Lakers. Maybe not your city, but close enough.

And I would agree.

His most impressive attribute was his longevity. He certainly didn't change the entire way players play the defensive position like Orr and he never came close to dominating the game like the other two.

 

Yea, he was just called Mr. Hockey, and Orr said he was the best.

And it wasn't just longevity. It was his scoring prowess, physical strength, and the longevity of his career.

But because you probably remember the old Gordy, this is why you don't put him in the top 2 or 3. Instead, you put him number four or lower.

Won 4 Championships

six Hart Trophies as the league's most valuable player and six Art Ross Trophies as the leading scorer.

Did Lemeiux do these things? Sure, in the pussy era. LOL.

Howe quickly established himself as a great goal scorer and a gifted playmaker with a willingness to fight.

So I'm thinking that all around, Howe was better than Orr. Or was Orr both a better scorer and defensive player.

Or was Orr better at one but you give the edge to Howe on the other?

I understand as both D and O, Howe is the best. Gretzky didn't play any D.

Did Lemiux? I'm sure Orr did because they all did back then.

Howe led Detroit to four Stanley Cups and to first place in regular season play for seven consecutive years (194849 to 195556), a feat never equaled in NHL history.

Howe had been in his prime during a defensive era, the 1940s and 1950s, when scoring was difficult and checking was tight.

When Richard retired in 1960, he paid tribute to Howe, saying "Gordie could do everything."[6]
 
 
 
 
 
I thought Gretzky moved around more than that. And I didn't know he played for the Oilers.

And I dind't know Montreal won that many times. WOW!!!

When's the last time they won?

And at 16 years without the Cup this is by far their worst slump. Prior to 1993 the most they'd ever gone without winning the Cup was 7 years.

Fuck you bitch!   I'm admitting I don't know all the details, but I have heard that gretzky played in a pussy era or the expanded the number of teams and hockey got watered down. Or the rules changed and you couldn't hit him. Or a combo of all three.

But I wanted someone with more knowledge of hockey to explain in better detail. Of course you said NOTHING Del.  

Now run along troll. Hell, you're the king of trolls.

Actually, I'm not 100% sure what a troll means.

And I would agree.

 

Yes, you've got all those great teams like the Lions and Tigers.  

Seriously, though, indoor soccer was actually on the verge of becoming a major sport in the middle / late 1980s. It even got a few games on network television back then. There were something like 20 teams in the MISL for a while. 10 NASL/MISL championships in 11 years was not the obsure thing like a single-A baseball team winning a championship or something. Many of the titles were hard fought and exciting. It was a big deal in San Diego at the time, there would be 13,000 fans showing up for a regular season game on a Tuesday night or whatever. I know younger people won't believe that, but it was true. And, it wasn't the same sport as outdoor soccer either, it was like a cross between hockey and soccer. It was exciting.

Lots of people compared the San Diego Sockers to the New York Yankees in terms of dominance. Of course, San Diego usually has crappy sports teams so people did make a big deal about it.

Seriously, though, indoor soccer was actually on the verge of becoming a major sport in the middle / late 1980s. It even got a few games on network television back then. There were something like 20 teams in the MISL for a while. 10 NASL/MISL championships in 11 years was not the obsure thing like a single-A baseball team winning a championship or something. Many of the titles were hard fought and exciting. It was a big deal in San Diego at the time, there would be 13,000 fans showing up for a regular season game on a Tuesday night or whatever. I know younger people won't believe that, but it was true. And, it wasn't the same sport as outdoor soccer either, it was like a cross between hockey and soccer. It was exciting.

Lots of people compared the San Diego Sockers to the New York Yankees in terms of dominance. Of course, San Diego usually has crappy sports teams so people did make a big deal about it.

 

First of all, the tigers are going to win a world series this year and the San Diago Padres are not.

Second of all, don't forget the 3 time Piston's champs.

If I was 2 years older, I could say that I have already seen 2 world series championships. 68 with Al Kaline and 84 with Jack Morris & Kirk Gibson, etc.

And if they didn't fuck up a couple of years ago, they could have 3. And at least they went to the world series a couple years ago, so 4 finals in 40 years. One a decade? I'll take that!!! Can San Diago say that?

Lions. Never mind.

Detroit Drive (arena football) They were in six consecutive championship ArenaBowls, one for each season of the team's Detroit existence, winning four of them, making them the dominant team of the League's early period. In 1992 they played in the Northern Division.

The Drive won in 1988, 1989, 1990 and 1992.

WNBA Shock (3 time champs)

Detroit Turbos (lacross) The Turbos won the 1991 MILL Championship.
Detroit Rockers (soccer) The Rockers won the 1991-1992 NPSL Championship

Yankees are the best because they buy the best players every year in the off season, and they have been struggling recently with the AL east getting even more competitive some how.

I hate the Steelers, but they are the best team in the NFL.

Go wings

 

People used to say Detroit was the best for the same reason as the Yankees. The owner spared no expense. But then the salary cap came and I thought the Red Wings would no longer dominate, yet somehow they still do.

I Steelers. I hadn't thought about them as being "America's Team". Remember Dallas said they were? I disagree. Yea, Steelers is a good choice.

 

Reason for that is guys like Zetter signing contracts that are a fraction of what they could command so that there is money available to strengthen the team. And that's exactly why Hossa will probably leave at the end of this series. He's taken 1 year at low $$ to try and get a cup. If he gets one, he'll want the $$ and the Wings don't do that.
 
 
 
 
That's an obscure thing to brag about. You're in Cali, so I give you the Lakers. Maybe not your city, but close enough.

All you have to say is I live in San Diago and you live in Detroit Sealy so you can have all those good teams.

And I would agree.

 

Yes, you've got all those great teams like the Lions and Tigers.  

 

Lions - no disagreement.

Tigers - you might want to check the standings.
 
 
 
Even if you disagree, what am I talking about?

 

The most intellectually honest thing you've ever said....

Congratulations!!
 
 
Wow, goalies don't get enough love in that top 100 list. People are so enamored with scoring!  

Pretty good game by the Pens last night to get the series close, but I don't think they're going to be able to overcome the 2-0 hole they started in. The Wings are just too strong.

I don't understand why hockey isn't more popular in the US. As far as I'm concerned it's the best playoffs of the 4 major sports.

I hope and believe you are right, but if the Pens win one more, it'll put the pressure on Detroit, but they will still have home court advantage, but that don't mean much in hockey.

And I remember years where the Wings were doing great and all of the sudden, they got knocked out. I don't think this is one of those years, but I sure with we would have won last night.

If we win tomorrow, its over for the Penguins.

Isn't it funny that in all three games the team that played the best lost every game?

And if Detroit wasn't in the finals, I would not be watching. No interest in hockey other than when Detroit is involved.

People don't care because they didn't play the sport when they were kids maybe.

I don't know a lot about hockey but I heard something about Gretzky playing in a different era that wasn't physical.

And I said what I said because I didn't want to argue if it is true or not. I just wanted to know what the word was. Was it that the refs babied him? Was it that there were more teams and the talent was deluted? Or was it that they changed the rules?

Are you stalking me bitch?   You got a man crush on me or something?

I personally don't put much stock in what era the player plays in
Hockey is and will still be one of the most physical sports that there is
through out your post on this subject you have called Wayne a Puss
and at the same time you say you don't know much about the sport
then I must assume then you don't know what your talking about
Football, Baseball, Basketball all have the same argument
who cares
If the player is good then base his merits on what he has achieved
nobody will ever know who is the greatest
and the changing of the rules play are large part
The ruling bodies of these organizations want scoring
so they do there best to hamper defense
is it fair no but that is what the causal fan wants
hardcore fans love defense usually, they want the struggle
were your average schmo wants a shootout
espn is part of this problem
the highlight reel gets a lot of attention

True. I don't know enough to talk shit.

But I have heard that it is impossible to break Gretzky's records, and it isn't because he was that much better than everyone else, even though he was. But it was because the rules were different. I don't understand. What rules were sooo different that his records will be safe forever?

And I think its safe to say Wayne Gretzky is the greatest OFFENSIVE hockey player to have ever played the game.

But all around best was someone like Howe or Orr or Lemeaux.

But again, you are right, I don't know shit. The only think I know is Gretzky is #1.

I found this:

Gretzky scored his 92 in a time of wide-open play and less-than-stellar goaltending. That would be the virtual opposite of today's game. Tight checking, huge equipment and extremely technical and athletic goaltending rule the day.
 
 
Bobo,

I don't know where you heard that Gretzky played in a less physical era. But let me assure you that it isn't true. If anything it was more physical. He wasn't babied by the refs either. However, we was protected by Dave Semenko, one of the baddest goons who ever played the game. But then again most teams have one or two enforcers that are there to protect their superstars, so there's nothing unique about that. As for the rule changes, they've pretty much all been to increase scoring, especially the elimination of two-line offsides. So again, whoever told you his records won't be broken due to rule changes doesn't know what they're talking about.
 
 
As someone who has watched hockey since birth, today's era is no more physical than Gretzky's era.

Gretzy's scoring record is going to be threatened more than his assist record, even with the elimination of the 2 line (red line) pass. Nobody's in the same zip code as Gretzky's goal record right now, but nobody's on the same continent for assists.

I'd a agree hockey was probably more physical in the 80s than it is now. There's little room for enforcers on teams these days, and there was a lot more fighting 20 years ago.

In 1987-88 season (Gretzky's last year with the Oilers), the top 10 fighting teams had 1,037 fights during the regular season, with the Bruins leading the way on 132. The top 20 enforcers alone had nearly 450 fights, with Miller, Macrae, and Donnelly each fighting over 30 times. Gretzky's team had 94 fights, with Kevin McClelland, Marty McSorley, Jeff Beukeboom and Steve Smith dropping the gloves on 70% of those occasions.

This regular season, the Ducks led the way with 82 fights, while the top 10 had 635 between them. The top fighters this year were still in the mid 20s, which suggests that while there are still enforcers, there are fewer of them.

No team has had over 100 fights in a season since Florida in 2001-02.

(Gretzky scored his 92 in a time of wide-open play and less-than-stellar goaltending. That would be the virtual opposite of today's game. Tight checking, huge equipment and extremely technical and athletic goaltending rule the day.) Is this not true?

Can anyone else tell mani why Gretzky couldn't do today what he did in the 80's?

You would know more than I would mani.

But "I've heard" there are reasons why his records can never be broken. The game has changed. Maybe someone else will be able to explain what the fuck I'm saying. I'm not an expert on this. I just heard this before. I'm not saying you are wrong.

Its like in the playoffs where defense gets tighter. Maybe back then they didn't play that hard during the regular season? Maybe the rules were different to encourage more scoring?

Or like a hockey allstar game. No ones hitting anyone. Maybe they played different back then? Less physical? I know the Howe's were physical, but the 80's were maybe a soft era? Gretzky never got hit.

And Detroit had Probert and Joey Cosure. Two bad mofo's.

Maybe I'm wrong. I heard this shit about Gretky the same way people bitch about Jordan being able to take an extra step or if you touched him he always got the benefit of the refs.

Maybe those are just haters saying that shit. You're right about them not fighting like they used to.

Well, Gordie Howe says Gretzky was the greatest of all time. If Gordie says it, that's good enough for me.

That said, Gretzky never had a 'Gordie Howe hat-trick'!

My neigbor bet $500 and got 3 to 1. He was expecting to win $1500, but now he isn't so sure.

We needed one of those fucking games in Pittsberg.

If you mean because we watch the Lions, you'd be wrong. We get to see some fantastic games on TV here. Lions games are usually blacked out because of poor attendance.

The only exception is Thanksgiving, when we have no choice but to watch turkeys as well as eat them. Of course, both produce the same result - an irresistible urge to fall asleep.

We used to pack the Silverdome when Barry Sanders was here. We are very faithful fans. We have been loyal for years. If attendance has been slipping every year, its because they really have given us a shitty product. But next year we will start all over again and be interested in game 1, 2, and if they suck, fuck them again. I can't believe anyone buys season tickets anymore.

Game 7 on Friday. Holy Shit!!! We better win!!!! I fell asleep and found out we lost this morning. I'm glad it'll be here game 7 but if we lose, what a blown opportunity. Couldn't win one in Pittsburg?

But we will win!!! We're hockey town after all.  
 
 
Based on the first six games, I predict Detroit will have game 7 wrapped up by the second intermission.

But I hope I'm wrong and Pittsburg at least makes it competitive. Go OVERTIME!!!

I"m leaving on Friday to drive down to the Key with the kids, so I'll be watching from a motel on the road somewhere in south Ohio or Kentucky..  

But I feel optimistic that more silverware is headed our way. We are something like 11-1 at home in the playoffs.

Go Wings!!!!!

 
 
 
Its strange that all the games have been won on home ice. That rarely happens in hockey.

I still expect Detroit to win, though.

This is almost more fun. I/We talked soo much shit, huh? WOW! We were playing poker and we were stunned. We tried switching watches from one hand to the next. One kid had a Penguins jersey and we put it on the Apollo statue that is in my buddies house. If you are wondering why he has an Apollo statue, we're greek, not gay.  

But holy crap. I could tell that was going to happen. I thought, "what if they get up a couple goals and we can never catch up", and it seemed to play out like my nightmare. And then we scored and we thought there was still hope, and then NOT. What a shocker.

PS. My buddy got his ring finger cut off at the nuckle on one of those table saws. He has a natural shocker now.

Isn't it funny that right after you win or lose, it really doesn't matter. Of course your weekend was a little better than mine, and next year you'll have bragging rights, but ultimately, who cares?

But it really was cool how Cindy Crosby and his team did it, despite no one really giving them a chance.

Son of a bitch Red Wings. They should have won game 6. You don't fucking let it go to 7 games because then anything can happen. Every game except one was close.

So I guess your team has a lot of young talent and there is no way they'll be able to keep that team together for next year.

The Wings will be back. Damn you!!!
