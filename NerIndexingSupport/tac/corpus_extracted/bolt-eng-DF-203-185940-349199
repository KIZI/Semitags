Do pronounce the last syllable of "Moscow" like:
(a) Cow, like the animal; or
(b) Co, like co-op.
I've always said "cow" but everyone on NPR says "co."
 
 
I say (a) "Mos-cow." Both options are correct, though.
My Russian-speaking BIL says "Moskva."
 
 
I say Mos-co.
In Russian, it's Musk-va with the accent on the second syllable, so neither way is a direct translation.
 
 
My Russian teacher says "Mos-cow" (like the animal) when she says it in English. I've never heard anyone IRL say "Mos-co" and I work with a lot of people who are Russia experts.
 
 
Mos-cao, Russia.
Mos-cow, Idaho.
 
 
Mos-COW
 
 
Mos-cow, like the animal, even though I think Mos-co is the correct English pronunciation.
 
 
Mos-cow
 
 
I've never really noticed the Mos-co pronounciation.
I do, however, notice when people say EYE-raq or EYE-ran, and it drives me a little bonkers.
 
 
I say Mos-co but I am British and I have never heard any brit say "mos -cow" - I just thought that was the US pronounciation.

Ditto, I am a Brit as well and pronounce it with the "co"
 
 
 
Mos-cao, Russia.
Mos-cow, Idaho.

 

Actually in Idaho they pronounce it Mos co, like the co in company. When I moved right near there it took me a while to remember. They always could tell I was not from the north west

My Russian-speaking brother says Mos-cow when he's speaking in English, as do his Russian ex-wife and his Ukrainian current wife.
 
 
Mos-coh
Isn't this how the TV journalists pronounce it?

Mos-cow
 
 
I was taught that in Russia it's Mos-cow and the Moscow in Idaho is pronounced without the w at the end.
Maybe NPR is talking about the one in Idaho.

This is correct.
 
 
 
Mos-cao, Russia.

What's the difference here? These are phonetically the same to me.
 
 
They may, but not everyone else from the area does.
 
 
It's a Henry Higgins difference.
Mos-cow : Mos ca ow
Mos-cao : Mos c aow (this should have a more noticeable vowel change.)
