Pau Gasol scored 14 of his 29 points in the fourth quarter and Kobe Bryant had 21 points and 13 assists as the Los Angeles Lakers beat Phoenix 124-112 on Wednesday night to claim a 2-0 lead in the Western Conference finals.

Ron Artest scored 18 points for the Lakers, who won their eighth straight playoff game and moved halfway to a possible NBA finals showdown with the Boston Celtics, who lead Orlando 2-0 in the East.

The Lakers remained unbeaten at home in the postseason despite a much-improved effort from the Suns, who lost the opener by 21 points. Phoenix leveled it at 90-all heading to the final period of Game 2, but Gasol and Bryant flawlessly led the Lakers to another high-scoring victory.

Game 3 is Sunday night in Phoenix.

Unless the Suns figure out a way to stop Los Angeles' offense, which hit better than 57 percent of its shots for the second straight game while racking up 252 total points, Beantown and Hollywood could be just a few days away from another chapter in their storied rivalry.

The Lakers have lost only one best-of-seven playoff series in club history after taking a 2-0 lead, winning the other 41. The 15-time champions haven't won eight straight games in the same postseason since their famous one-loss run through the 2001 playoffs.

The Staples Center crowd enthusiastically booed Amare Stoudemire, who on Tuesday belittled Lamar Odom's 19-point, 19-rebound performance in the opener as "a lucky game." Stoudemire appeared determined to back up his words with aggression, finishing with 18 points and six rebounds while Odom had 17 points and 11 boards in another superb game off the bench.

Grant Hill scored 14 of his 23 points in the third quarter while Phoenix erased a 14-point deficit, playing with more efficiency and aggression than in Game 1. But the Lakers went back ahead by 11 midway through the fourth with a 9-0 run, and the Suns couldn't stop Bryant and Gasol from executing their two-man game to perfection.

Jason Richardson scored 27 points for Phoenix, and Steve Nash had 11 points and 15 assists. Jared Dudley hit five 3-pointers.
