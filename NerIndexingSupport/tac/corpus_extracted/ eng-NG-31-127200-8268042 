Does anybody remember the UEFA report that branded Liverpool fans the
worst in Europe? Well i have always thought they were just passionate
about football. However i attended todays game at Anfield and had
stones thrown at me from the Liverpool section when Frank Lampard
equalised. I was in the Chelsea section (Anfield Road Lower) and one
almost hit me on the head but ended up catching me on the shoulder. I
was wondering if the same happened to any CFC fans who went to todays
game and post here on USENET.

They were also outsung almost the entire game until they took the lead
and gave a brief cry of The Fields Of Anfield Road then they were
silent again. Chelsea fans were singing "Where's your famous
atmosphere".

I was quite suprised about this as this did not happen the last time i
visited Anfield. Hopefully it is just a one-off. Even though i do
recall them throwing shite at Man Utd fans the last time they met in
the FA Cup. However im not going to tar all LFC fans with the same
brush as that would be totally unfair and they do have a lot of loyal
non-troublemakers but the minority let them down today.
