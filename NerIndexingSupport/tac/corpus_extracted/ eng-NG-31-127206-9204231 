B-Rod (Boras-Rodriguez) leaving causes salaries to go up again, which
Boras knows. The Tankee's will now "over pay" for free agents to save
face and keep up with the Sox. I can see Lowell being offered 18mil. per
year for 3  years by the Tanks. Will the Sox match, or will Lowell want
to stay with the Sox no matter the price?  I hate to say it, but this
puts us in a bigger disadvantage of keeping Lowell.

Now we know why B-Rod stood up Hank Aaron last night , not being in
attendance to receive his "Henry Aaron Award". The announcement "Have
Bat Will Travel" again was planned well in advance.

Now, I have a few upset predictions on where B-Rod will land. My 1st
hopeful choice would be the Mets. Talk about pissing the Tankees and
their fans off!!!!
He stays in NY, and his wife can wear he "F-U" shirt all the time. The
Mets can afford it ..new stadium coming ... TV network ratings bonanza
... and they can trade Wright or Reyes for a top line starting pitcher.
Puts them at top of NL East for years!
Next upset hopeful #2 ... Seattle Mariners. He goes back to where he is
loved (remember earlier in the season  the great reception from Mariner
fans?), Seattle has Playstation money to burn, Mariners become the team
they "use" to be when they had Griffey and B-Rod.

Having said all that,   it could be Cubs or Dodgers. NOT Red Sox.
