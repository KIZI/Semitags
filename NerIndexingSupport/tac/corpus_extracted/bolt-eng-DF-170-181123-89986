Darfur violence may be worse, despite U.N. efforts

By Louis CharbonneauFri Apr 4, 4:29 PM ET

The violence against civilians in Sudan's Darfur region may be worsening, despite seven U.N. Security Council resolutions and four years of efforts to end it, the United Nations chief said on Friday.

"Four years ago this week, the Security Council first took up the issue of Darfur," Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in a statement. "The situation remains grim today, as then, if not worse."

Funny how we invaded Iraq and now occupy it because of alleged this and alleged that while we completely ignore a genocide.

We should be in Darfur.

Sure thing.
 
 
Hell yes the UN is useless. They didn't enforce the resolutions against Saddam, they haven't done anything in Darfour, their peacekeepers raped their way across the Congo, seems like a waste of space to me.
 
 
And how much money would we save if we through the UN out of it's nice NYC digs and stopped giving money to the UN so it could waste it worldwide?

Ronald Reagan would be proud of you.
 
 
Good, because I am proud of Ronald Reagan. And we still should kick the UN out.

No. Ronald Reagan, and other corrupt administrations like his, pushed us into becoming a Rogue State. The only reason why the UN is deemed weak by the US is because the US violates every international law ever written.

The fact that you are proud of that shows why 9/11 happened.

The UN was broken well before Ronald Reagan every got into office and has been broken every since. Where else but the UN could Libya be seated on a Human Rights commission?

And what about all of the international laws France, Germany, Vietnam, China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Libya, Iran, Iraq, Chad, Somalia, Argentina, and others have broken? Obviously, we are not the only ones that ignore the UN when it gets stupid. How come we are the only ones that get chastized for it?

And 9/11 happened because people like Jimmy Carter did not act forcefully when it came to the illegal acts by Iran when it seized are embassy (in violation of international law) in 1979. Didn't see the UN deal with that.

Or how about 9/11 happened because Bill Clinton allowed people to blow up two embassies, a military barracks, and a US Navy warship without ever dealing with that? Was he waiting for the UN to hand out the justice?

9/11 happend because a bunch of terroristic assholes thought the US was a pussy and wold roll over and die if they bombed us. They thought wrong (despite the best efforts of simpering idiots such as yourself, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.)

You are so partisaned. You want to blame Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton and refuse to shine any light on the damage that Reagan, Bush & Bush caused. Or how Nixon destroyed the Bretton Woods system.

Jimmy Carter was negotiating with Iran and did send in Special Forces to rescue them. Bush Sr. and Reagan made a better deal with the Iranian Revolutionaries. But you are too partisan to even acknowledge that.

The 9/11 terrorists did not think we were pussies. If they thought that, they would have invaded outright. They attacked us because of our foreign policies and military actions that have an adverse affect on the Muslims cultures...specifically, the poor.

I'm partisan? I'll be the first to admit that Bush didn't plan Iraq correctly and it's been a lot harder then it should have. And Reagan should have blasted Hezbelloah after the Beruit bombing. But Carter allowed a two bit country to hold a superpower hostage for 444 days because he "negotiated" instead of bombing them back to the Stone Age.

Carter sent in a rescue misson that was too convoluted to ever succeed. For 50 people he spent 444 days locked in the White House allowing some two bit dictator to call the tune he danced to. Reagan told Iran he would bomb the shit out of them until our people came home. Iran saw the light and let them go.

Have you ever read OBL's writings. He calls us pussies time and time again, sepcifically mentioning Somalia. And if you believe OBL care about the Muslim poor, you're dumber then you look.
 
 
What the UN needs is it's own, independent military, made up of member nation volunteers. At the very minimum, security council volunteers. It needs it's own bases located in ares deemed neutral by the international community. This is never going to happen because people would squabble over the who gets to be general, what country gets what posistions. Who's fighter do we use, etc. The money is there but no one would want it. It worked for a while with the US providing the bulk of UN volunteer forces, the problem is that since the US has acted so unilaterally and we've spread ourselves so thinly, we can't really do anything anywhere but Iraq and Afghanistan.
 
 
The UN just needs to go the way of the League of Nations.

So does Bush - and thankfully he soon will be

No, because they never invade outright. They don't operate that way. They ALWAYS target the weak and defenseless, the unsuspecting, and the innocent. That's the way those heroes work.

Nor did they attack us because of our foreign policies or military actions. They are not Muslim Freedom Fighters. They attacked us because we are American, because we're Christians, and because they want to kill us. It doesn't matter what we're doing, or where we're at. The reason they attack women and children is because they want us all to die, you fucking idiot. It isn't because they protest our politics. They want us dead. They could care less what we believe or where our troops are. In fact, they prefer our troops be engaged, leaving our borders undefended.

We could save so much money if we just nationalized Exxon Mobil as well.

Are you really in favor of removing private property? The UN owns that property, not NYC, nor NY.

*sigh*. More people who have no idea what the UN is about bashing it.  

The thing most amusing about this is that the groups who benefit the most from it, bitch the most about it. The US is, by far, the most powerful member in the UN and bends the organizations will and actions. But yet the US always bitches about it.
