Neo-Nazis, White Supremacists and Anarchists

Religious groups are not the only targets of Lerma's hatred. He also
supports and defends what the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and the
Simon Wiesenthal Center have both condemned: the Neo-Nazi movement of
Willis Carto.

Nazi hunter Yaron Svoary, quoted in the Hartford Courant on Nov. 7,
1994, said about Carto:

"The most notorious Nazi in the world is not German but Willis
Carto."

Willis Carto

Lerma, a longtime supporter, is on the Board of Policy of Liberty
Lobby, an anti-Semitic organization founded by Carto. Lerma tries to
keep quiet his connection to Carto and his racist organization, as
demonstrated by this extract from an email Lerma sent to an associate:

"I was asked to speak at the 40th anniversary convention of
Liberty Lobby...

"I suggest that we don't promote my relationship with Willis Carto
...

"We have the full support of Willis Carto, and the 'patriot'
movement in the United States."

Further information regarding the activities of Lerma's close
associate, Carto, can be obtained in abundance from the Anti-
Defamation League and the Simon Wiesenthal Center.
