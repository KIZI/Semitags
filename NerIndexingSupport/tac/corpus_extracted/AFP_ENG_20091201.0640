Southeast Asia's biggest bank DBS Group Holdings said it has about 1.8 billion
Singapore dollars (1.3 billion US dollars) of debt exposure in Dubai but
described the situation as "manageable".

In a statement issued late Monday, DBS said that "a substantial portion" of the
debt is to Dubai-owned companies operating in Singapore that "are sound, such as
Labroy and South Beach, which is collateralised".

South Beach is a prime commercial and residential joint venture in Singapore's
convention district, while Labroy Marine is a local shipyard.

"The bank believes that the situation is manageable", the statement said.

The Dubai government announced last week it was seeking a six-month moratorium
on debt payments by flagship conglomerate Dubai World.

The announcement sent shockwaves around the world on Thursday and Friday as
investors feared a possible default by Dubai and its state-owned businesses,
which together owe an estimated 80 billion dollars.

DBS said it has provided a 558-million-dollar (400 million US) loan to Dubai
World, equal to about 0.2 percent of its total balance sheet.

Spokesmen for Singapore's two other homegrown lenders, the United Overseas Bank
and the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp, said Tuesday that they had no significant
exposure to Dubai borrowers.

The de facto central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), said in a
separate statement that it did not expect the fall-out from Dubai's debt woes to
hit the city-state.

It said Singapore's banking sector exposure to the United Arab Emirates, of
which Dubai is a part, represented less than one percent of the industry's total
banking assets.

"We do not expect developments in Dubai to adversely affect Singapore's
financial stability," the MAS said.

"MAS continues to be in close contact with the financial institutions here, and
with central banks and regulators in key jurisdictions."

Singapore property giant City Developments Ltd. (CDL), part of the South Beach
joint venture in which Dubai World has a one-third share, said Tuesday that it
did not expect any impact on itself or the project.

However, it added it was prepared to inject more funding if needed.

"Should the joint venture company require additional funds in the future, the
shareholders may be called upon to put in their proportionate share of funding,"
CDL said in a statement.
