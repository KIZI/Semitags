It has been nearly a quarter-century since a
former Alaska poet laureate composed a second verse for the Alaska
state song, adding lines to celebrate the diverse indigenous people
of the Last Frontier.

The verse begins:
      A native lad chose our Dipper's stars
      for Alaska's flag that there be no bars
      among our cultures. Be it known
      through years our natives' past has grown
      to share our treasures, hand in hand,
      to keep Alaska our Great Land.

And even though the Alaska Youth Choir sang the verse on the
House floor on the opening day of the legislative session here in
January, by the time the session ended in April, the verse remained
what it always has been: unofficial.

For at least the third time, lawmakers rejected an effort to
formally adopt the verse as part of the state song, "Alaska's
Flag." The reasons reveal sensitive issues in a state with a
complicated racial history. After all, the lyrics of the second
verse make direct reference to Native Alaskans specifically because
the original verse does not. The original verse, written by Marie
Drake in the 1930s, speaks of "the gold of the early sourdough's
dreams," a reference to the largely white gold miners who rushed
up from the Lower 48 more than a century ago. The lyrics build from
a description of the state flag, which features the Big Dipper and
was designed by a native boy, Benny Benson, though he is not
mentioned in the song.

The author of the second verse, Carol Beery Davis, a white woman
who played the Wurlitzer organ during silent movies at the Palace
Theater in the 1920s and later became the state poet laureate in
1967, devoted much of her life to learning and writing about native
Tlingit songs and culture.

"She really cared about them," said her daughter, Constance
Davis, 83.

Supporters of the second verse were optimistic that it would be
made official this year. Yet while the bill passed the Senate this
time, it never came to a final House vote. The dividing lines were
not always predictable.

"The flow of words is very even, the metering is very
consistent, there's a lot of single-syllable words," Bryce Edgmon,
a Democratic state representative from Dillingham who is of native
descent, said of the original verse. "It sings itself. Then you
get to her words, and it's 'a native lad,' which, you know, I've
never, ever heard of natives being called lads. That's off the mark
for me right there."
