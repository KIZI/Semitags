Detroit (6-7) at San Diego (8-5) - 4:15 pm (Sheridan's line: San Diego
by 9.5) [Worth Watching!]

Detroit lost an absolute heart-breaker last week to the Cowboys,
28-27. If I was still capable of feeling normal human emotions, I
would have wept. Thankfully, as a lifelong Lions fan, I am bereft of
all affect during Sundays in December. San Diego is 5-1 at home this
season, while the Lions are 2-4 on the road. I see little reason to
expect anything other than a blowout by the Chargers. However, hope
springs eternal among the <STRIKE>terminally neurotic</STRIKE> Lions
faithful.
