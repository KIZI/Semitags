Voting will end on December 21 - so vote early and vote often!

On January 1, 2008, HGTV will announce four winners during its Rose Parade
coverage, based on the highest number of votes. These winners will join New
Orleans, LA, still recovering from the devastation of Hurricanes Katrina and
Rita, as beneficiaries of the first annual Change the World week. Beginning
April 28, 2008, the projects in each of the winning markets will be
completed through the help of volunteers and HGTV partners.
