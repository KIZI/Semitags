Wowza - wouldn't be surprised if they're going to tie this in with all their other moms shows. She looks different here.

i don't get why celebs have to make it in to such a dramatic, lying ordeal. you got found out. deal with it. creating a whirlwind only makes me think you're out for money and it's more about you than the baby. i understand wanting to wait, but if you've been busted there are appropriate and honest responses.
 
 
I'll just say it and ignore any flames that come my way- I don't think Snookie will be a bad mom. I think she'll probably be the kind of mom that spoils her baby rotten but I do not think the baby will be born with fetal alcohol syndrome as some believe from the comments I've read on various forums. She maintains an on-screen persona for the good of her MTV show that promotes drama, heavy drinking and promiscuity. But she seems like a very sweet and sensitive girl and I think she'll take this pregnancy seriously and do what she should to have a healthy baby. Plus, since she's hopefully not drinking her relationship with Jionni may be way less volatile. I may be wrong but I hope for the best for her and her baby!
 
 
oh lordy.
Wonder what;s going to happen w/ her a JWOWW's spin-off show in Jersey City?
 
 
I agree with PP. The second I found out I was pregnant I wanted to tell everyone. Not only that it just shows that all they care about is money. I like how Beyonce and Jay-Z shared their photos, like every other proud parent, not seeing which magazine will pay them the most.

I think this is unfair.
The first trimester is scary. Being excited/happy and being afraid for anyone to find out during the first tri are not mutually exclusive.
I never blatantly lied during my first trimester, but I did deflect questions and mislead friends/family/coworkers who we weren't telling right away.

I think she looks great!
I too don't judge celebs for not dishing sooner, it's a personal decision.

I didn't mean it to be unfair. I said I wanted to tell everyone. Never said I did. I also wasn't going to sell my story either to get money. That's what I meant by that. Sorry if it was taken the wrong way, but I still will stick by my comment that she did it for money.
EDIT--Not like I am famous and would get any kind of money or care if I did try to sell it. LoL

I too started to judge her for selling around her story until I realized if I was at her level of "celebrity" I'd want all the money I could get for that news breaking too.

I actually agree with this.
 
 
Eh....who would have thought that Nicole Ritchie would have settled down so much and become such a good mom, either? You never know.
As for holding out for money - honestly, reality celebs' time in the spotlight is pretty fleeting in the long run. not a bad idea to try and set up a security blanket while she can.

This! I totally forgot about Nicole Ritchie! She definiely settled down and seems to enjoy mommy-hood.
And ditto the money thing. Gotta maximize the benefits while you can.
 
 
I'm on the "I think she might be a good mom, too" train. Who knows? I think her Snooki persona is exactly that; it's her TV personality. She's a vet tech in real life, right? I mean, she got there so she can't be as clueless as she pretends to be. I can't imagine her having a child but I also can't imagine having children myself and we're only 3 years apart in age.
I did hear that her show with Jenni is going to happen but JS is the one that's uncertain.
 
 
I agree with her being a good mom. I can see it. Before being pregnant she was a 24 year old that got paid to go to the Jersey Shore and drink of course she drank and partied.
As for selling the story if people didn't sell their stories there wouldn't be magazines and people buy them so they have to run stories.
Also I agree when she was being interviewed before she was under 12 weeks and she probably didnt want to tell. I know that her announcing it in a magazine means she is a celebrity, but celebrities are people too and she probably didn't want to say anything at all but with all the speculation decided to do it
 
 
I had a m/c not that long ago. We announced to our family on Christmas and had to tell everyone about the m/c. I would hate to have to do that to the entire world. It is not something I would want to deal with publicly. Plus the media can be harsh and you know if she had a m/c they would be blaming it on her.
Her celebrity status probably isn't going to stay for long. If I were her, I would probably sell my story. Kids are expensive and that money could be saved for their college fund long after her Jersey Shore days are over. She's not a powerhouse couple like Beyonce and Jay Z. It's not really fair to compare their financial decisions.
 
 
I'm happy for her and her fianc√©.
Her fame won't last forever so I don't see the big deal about selling her pregnancy announcement. The one article may be enough to fund her child's education or even her own.
 
 
I like Snookie, but the issues presented in the title on the US Weekly cover shows that maybe she's not mature enough to be a mom? I hope I'm wrong and she will be the best mom ever, but she needs to grow up fast in the next several months first. I do not like that Jionni kid, he's more immature than her.
eta: That picture of Lohan in the bottom right hand corner scared me. I thought it was Candy Spelling at first. oof!

I also agree with this, IRL I know people who have partied like that all the way to the time they got pregnant and then when they had the baby they are the most mature loving parents. You should enjoy your life any way you want before you have kids. If someone paid me $100,000 an episode I would probably get drunk and make an ass out of myself too.
I also agree with her not saying anything right away, I actually thought it was classy. Because if she had announced it and then had a miscarriage people would flame her for making up a story about being pregnant just to get more famous.Regardless if she was really pregnant or not. In my experience you don't announce it until the first trimester is over because of the risk. Anyways I am happy for Nicole and Jionni and I think that will be good parents. Only time will tell.
