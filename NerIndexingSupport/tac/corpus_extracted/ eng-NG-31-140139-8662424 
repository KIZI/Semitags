I noticed that we have former Bristol City defender, Shaun Lamb, on
trial with the Grecians at the moment. He played in the reserve team
midweek win at Bournemouth.

Born in Bristol in November 1986, Lamb was a youth product at Ashton
Gate, signing a full contract in the summer of 2005, but was unable
to force his way into the first team.
