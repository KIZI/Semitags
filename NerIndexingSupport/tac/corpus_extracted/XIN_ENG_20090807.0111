Singapore detected 23,800 contraband smuggling cases in the first half of this
year, a 35 percent increase compared to the same period last year, local media
reported on Friday.

According to TV broadcaster Channel NewsAsia, the data released by Singapore's
Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) showed that there were some 3,300
security related items, such as gun replicas and handcuffs, detected in the
first half of this year, up over 80 percent from the same period last year.

There has also been an 87 percent increase in the number of cigarette packets
seized in the first half of this year to 734,000 packets, though the total
number of smuggling cases has actually dropped 10 percent to 8,200 cases,
compared to last year.

ICA said this can be attributed to more syndicates bringing in a larger quantity
of contraband cigarettes.

More people are also attempting to smuggle illegal food, flora and fauna items
into Singapore. 2,700 cases were detected in the first half of this year,
compared to 700 cases in the same period last year.

As for the smuggling of humans, ICA said the number of foreigners who entered
illegally remained constant at about 3,000 people.
