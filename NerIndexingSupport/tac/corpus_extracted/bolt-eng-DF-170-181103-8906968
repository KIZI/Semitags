We know it's not their base. The Republican leadership have put millions of them out of work.

Who does that leave?

The Chamber of Commerce and Karl Rove? Where are they getting the money from.

What part of this ad is about jobs? Have Republicans given up on jobs and now it's just "let's see how much we can squeeze out of the American People?"

See. In order to get money, you do something called work. By working you produce the fruits of your labors which builds wealth by providing goods and services to your fellow man.

I know this is totally foreign to you. But working hard for what you have and then choosing to serve the public is quite common among us.
 
 
So all that money going to Republicans is from working Republicans? What is the average donation? How many people "donated"?

Who is paying for the ads Democrats are running? Martians? Because it surely cannot be the poor and unemployed that you think is the base of the Democratic Party.

But only 6% of them!  
 
 
Syrenn's got a point. Real question, though, is does it really matter? Or is this one of those, "complain about whatever find a reason later" kinda things that both parties like to do so much?
