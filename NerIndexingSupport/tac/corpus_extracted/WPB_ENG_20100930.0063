WASHINGTON - Starting Tuesday, getting tested for HIV in the District of
Columbia will be as easy as renewing a driver's license.

In what District officials say is the first effort of its kind nationwide, the
city will partner with a nonprofit to offer free HIV testing at one Department
of Motor of Vehicles branch - with participants receiving up to $15 to help
defray their DMV costs.

The year-long project would be another way to reach residents in a city where a
2008 epidemiology update concluded that 3 percent of the population had tested
positive for HIV/AIDS. That is well above the 1 percent considered to be a
general epidemic, advocates for prevention and city officials said.

"We wanted to have a broad audience and a captive audience. You're captive at
the DMV," said Angela Fulwood Wood, chief operations officer of Family and
Medical Counseling Service, a nonprofit group that already tests about 5,000
District residents a year.

But the program takes two other unusual steps: It offers up to $15 to help
offset the costs of DMV services and provides immediate counseling as well as
medical attention. Based on customer traffic and human behavior in other free
testing programs, organizers expect to test about 3,000 people annually, roughly
15 percent of the customers at the DMV location. Rapid oral test results at the
DMV office will be available in 20 minutes.

"This is exactly the kind of innovation we need in this city," said D.C. Council
member David Catania, I-At Large, who called Wood a "rock star" for coming up
with the unorthodox idea. "This is a model for the country in how we bring
testing to people on a routine basis."

A. Toni Young, executive director of Community Education Group, said the program
will reach residents who do not visit doctors regularly and are apprehensive
about going to clinics and testing sites. Going to the DMV jumps the hurdle of
"waiting for people to come in and ask for the test," said Young. "We see people
we may miss through the medical system."

Those who test positive will get counseling at the DMV and more extensive, one-
on-one services at CEG's office nearby. "I'm not going to give you a slip of
paper and say the onus is on you, now go" get help, Young said. "We will pick
them up, take them to Family Medical and then back to the DMV. We will follow up
with a call within 24 hours."

The city Health Department is supplying HIV testing kits and educational
materials, and the DMV is contributing office space. Family and Medical received
$250,000 in funding from Gilead Sciences, a Foster City, Calif.-based
biopharmaceutical company, to help cover staff and the $15 money orders made out
to the D.C. treasury for license renewals, changes in address and other
services.
