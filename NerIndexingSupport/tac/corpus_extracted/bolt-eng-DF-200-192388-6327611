i do feel special  
Awesome, i was going to apply to Nott trent when i was thinking of applying for sociology- looks like an awesome uni!  
I'm probably going to notts uni now though
 
 
One of my friends is going there, doing some clever course to do with micro biology   maybe you'll see him when your there! not that you'd know though... hehe

lol but i'm having a gap year so i would be a year behind him anyway  
where else have you applied?
 
 
errrm, Manchester, but its stupidly hard to get in there :-( I have to get two Bs and an A as well as be able to speak another language. Also, Sheffield Hallam Uni, and Warick, but again, stupidly hard to get in

eek, yeah there is no way in hell i would have gotten in to manchester on another course...nursing is just pretty easy, they only want BCC! another language seems a bit insane
 
 
I know   I want to study English! not Spanish! but hey, it didnt work anyway so no point worrying about it! :-) Can't wait, but im a total dweeb when it comes to anything like that, so ill probably mess everything up within ten minutes of moving out!

In addition to my message above, it made me complete it though, and gave me a kick up my backside if you don't mind me saying. I very rarely came on here during that time and that made me complete most of my work.

Possibly. I haven't listened to any of her music, and to be fair, I don't really intend to.

That is perfectly understandable (I only really said it in case someone came along and said something along the lines of "ZOMG i love amy winehouse")

Ah, I'll answer that then:

AFC Wimbledon won the Conference South (5 leagues below the Premiership) today.
FC United are 3rd in the Northern Premier League Premier Division (6 leagues below).
Stoke Bishop are 2nd in the Bristol Downs League Division Four (23 leagues below).

Shall I just edit that:
AFC Wimbledon won the Conference South (5 leagues below the Premiership) today.
FC United are 3rd in the Northern Premier League Premier Division (2 leagues below AFC Wimbledon - impossible to meet until we get into National leauges.).
Stoke Bishop are 2nd in the Bristol Downs League Division Four (The bottom league in the Football Pyramid).

You know I said in your thread how much I'd like to see FC play AFCW in a competitive game, so it's possible in the FA Cup.
If you mean Stoke Bishop, nah, I've been a fan of the league for two years now, really good.

Ah right, don't watch that myself.

It's a bit of a low standard, always goals in the games, but I've never been to a game so wouldn't know. BBC Bristol have a lot of coverage about it though.

Depends on the power of the person who's given you reputation.
 
 
  I have absolutely no idea. Because neg rep is more powerful than posuitive?

Haha i knew someone would know the right answer!
 
 
thanks William.

*dances to the music*

Whats your fave music?
 
 
jazz quartets  

I jest. I like too much music to really name one area in particular....

Complete opposite.

Negative reputation is half of your positive reputation score.

Well you have been here since 2007.
Right now I'm interested in Musicals (Hairspray, High School Musical, Cats, The Beautiful Game)    
 
 
Is the beautiful game a musical about football?

It's not 'too much', it's 'helpful information'

Thanks, it's just that (as you know) I answer a lot of threads in the About forum which is where I get most of the answers from, or the FAQ.

yes, yes it does. (but not as much as tea!)  
 
 
Tea is like the king of the food world!!!!!

Thought it was a drink?

Unless you mean tea time which you have an evening meal.
 
 
Both... Tea (the drink) is the Queen, Tea (the meal) is the king.
*Food is King, Drink is Queen*
 
 
XD haha, couldn't agree more =) except maybe the other way around XD
 
 
Maybe......

but what is the point - Tea (the drink) is more delicate... like a lady...
 
 
Got to admit a cup of tea's the best drink though.  
 
 
Yeh...

*sips a cuppa*

I should have really said "please could you help me translate the post above yours?" Currently, it is quite abrupt and rude. My apologies.

I'm having trouble understanding the meaning/relevance/significance(?) of "should be dweebs" in the sentence.

Ah sorry mate, now I get what you mean.

I don't know myself actually, she's said it a few times in here.
 
 
That's a pity. I figured that since you've spent a lot of time in this thread with this one, you may have picked up the native tongue, but we will just have to wait.

They needed to win against Bradford PA (6th, FC were 5th), could only draw 1-1.

The team that got into the play-offs were drawing 2-2 before they scored in the 83rd minute to win the game.
