NEW YORK -- A New York judge has given a woman permission to harvest her dead lover's sperm so she can still have his baby.

Johnny Quintana was only 31 when he died Thursday of an apparent heart attack.

He had wanted to have a second child with his fiancee, Gisela Marrero, but the only way to make it happen was to quickly collect his sperm, which stays fresh for only 36 hours after death.

A court order was needed because Quintana and Marrero were not yet married.

The Bronx judge said "yes" Friday with only four hours left until the deadline.

Sperm bank staffers then rushed to Jacobi Medical Center, where Quintana's body lay.

Marrero already has a 2-year-old son with Quintana.
 
 HeraldNet: Woman can harvest dead boyfriend's sperm, judge says 

I am outraged. This is not even a wife, so what right does she have to his sperm? In one fell swoop this radical judge's decision will set off a chain of reactions including a child being born into a most bizarre situation without a father and thus increasing substantially the chances that he/she would be at some point be involved with the penitentiary system.

"Various studies come up with slightly different numbers, but all the figures are grim. According to the Index of Leading Cultural Indicators, children from single-parent families account for 63 percent of all youth suicides, 70 percent of all teenage pregancies, 71 percent of all adolescent chemical/substance abuse, 80 percent of all prison inmates, and 90 percent of all homeless and runaway children." Ann Coulter, Guilty p 37-38.

Not to mention who will be financially responsible for these children born out of wedlock? It is no big accomplishment to give birth to young, even animals can do that. The challenge is too raise them in the best way possible and that includes having a mother and a father. Why do people refuse to see into the future of the children of singleparent homes? You give children a fighting chance when you bring them up in intact families.

The counterculture won on this one. Sad. Sad, indeed.
 
 
One of the things that really causes a collision with secular progressives is their not seeming to put any value on parenting. This group has never really explained in a tangible way that one who objects can accept, and, frankly, more often leaves the average person with the impression that they indeed do put no value on parenting, and do not care what happens on the way to the state taking over the function. I used to thing was paranoid delusion. No longer.
 
 
Neither do they put any value on children.

This is where you end up when you determine that the components that make human life are of no value and can be picked up, put down, tampered with, destroyed, tortured, sold, experimented on, at a whim.
 
 
hey, er... while you're all so busy nursing your moral indignation....

did the article say if anyone even opposed the application?

No?

didn't think so. which means it was granted on default and the judge wouldn't have had any basis to deny it...

unless of course he imposed his own morality (oops... I mean YOUR morality) and engaged in judicial activism to foster your agenda.

How is this any different than a woman going to a sperm bank?
 
 
Now, why should the judge have denied the unopposed application?

 
Marrero's mom prayed they would make it in time.

"I want my son's sperm to live," Carmen Moreno, Quintana's 56-year-old mother, said through sobs as she testified.

"The Lord took him away from me. This is the only way for him to live on. He wanted this. He wanted this."

The race against time really began at 3:30 a.m. Thursday when Quintana, a seemingly healthy, 31-year-old concierge and auto mechanic, collapsed and died while watching an episode of NBC's "The Chopping Block" on a computer with his brother.

Through her tears, Marrero remembered their last talk about the future and immediately asked Jacobi if it would be possible to remove and preserve Quintana's sperm.

Under law, it takes a court order.

So while Quintana's body was placed in a cooling room and an ice bag was placed on his testicles to preserve his potential progeny, Marrero set about preparing a funeral - and building a legal argument.

Much of Thursday was spent frantically calling sperm banks, lawyers and arranging for an emergency hearing before Sherman.

To argue a case that Sherman said is unprecedented in New York, they enlisted lawyer Nelson Stern, who usually handles disability cases.

Earlier this month in Texas, a judge granted a mother's right to extract and preserve her son's sperm after he died in a fight outside an Austin bar.

Sherman said he was not aware of any cases like this one in New York. "There is very little precedent," the judge said after the 10-minute hearing.

*snip*

"All our dreams we accomplished together," Marrero said of the man she began dating when she was 18. "He was my best friend, the love of my life."
 
 Judge allows wife to harvest dead husband's sperm 
 
 
It's not like he's going to need them where he's at.. (Sorry)

Seriously tho.. They both apparently wanted another child, they already had one together, they were getting married... If he had died after she'd become pregnant the second time, he'd STILL be leaving a single parent behind (not like he didn't anyway with the first one).

What's the big deal? Usually I agree with a lot of what you say, PC, but I think you're loopy on this one.
 
 
The interesting question is whether the resulting child will be considered qualified to make a claim on the dead father's estate.
 
 
he isn't a life in being at the time of the passing... he'll inherit through mom i would think.

*edit*

mom has no legal right to the estate... that would be parents maybe siblings... unless there's a will.

hmmmmmmm... ok. it is an interesting question.
 
 
First and foremost, the consideration should be the life of the potential child.

I have posted many times about the potentially disasterous future of a child born in a single-mother household, and now we compound the situation by allowing some instant-gratification liberal who wants what she wants when she wants it, to go to a liberal judge who says "you want the sperm, who am I to deprive you of your whim" and society will now pay the tab, both financial and societal, for this child.

Wow, forgive this run-on sentence.

And, since NY has no common-law marriage, what standing does this woman have to demand the sperm?
 
 
There is no potential child yet.

And potential life has no rights. You might not like that. But it's fact.

Again, no one opposed the application. It wasn't the judge's place to insert his own religious beliefs... assuming he would agree with you.
 
 
She might want to wait until after the autopsy before getting pregnant again since he died suddenly at age 31.

Hypothetical question: say you are in charge of adoptions, and this single mother comes to you and says that her boyfried tragically passed away, and they had a child between them, but had always talked of having another.

Do you assign them one of the children for whom you have responsibility?

Are there questions you would be compelled to ask, that are not being considered here?

And, since NY has no common-law marriage, what standing does this woman have to demand the sperm?
 

Even if it was true that all children of single parent are doomed to end up in prison like you seem to think, why do you assume this woman is going to remain single all her life? Hey, maybe she and the judge might decide to get together and blend their families?
 
 
Dead people can't oppose. Nor can they consent.

Sherman said he was not aware of any cases like this one in New York. "There is very little precedent," the judge said after the 10-minute hearing.

Nevertheless, Sherman ruled in favor of the family.

"There is no basis, as far as I know, not to let them do this," he said. "Under this kind of tragic circumstances, this is all that is left for them."

With no precedent, the judge should have shown a sense of responsibility for the future progeny, far more inportant than the "wishes" of the prospective mother.

Well, in all honesty, if the two of them had been intending to have another child together - and one assumes that she produced some sort of evidence to support that assertion to the court - then THAT is what right she has to his sperm: he wanted her to have it.
 
 
I am opposed to this woman having another child because more kids is not what this over populated planet needs at the moment, but to say she is wrong to do this because she was not married to the guy and because she's not married to anyone else at the moment is silly.

Yes, it sounds like it was his wish to have another child. She is fufilling his will. No pun..
 
 
It would be wrong if she was married to him, too.

There's just so much wrong with the engineering of children it boggles the mind.

After digging up Abe and stealing his sperm, I want to dig up what's left of James Dean and have one of his kids.

And what if the child grows up and finds herself in the same situation that her mother is in now and the best possible life for her, the child, requirs a judge's permission to use the sperm of her dead boyfriend to conceive a child? Would you allow that best possible life to her, but not to her mother?

Looks to me like that was her only boyfriend, HIS family agreed, and stated pretty much the same things that she did..

IOW, the entire family was in agreement.. It doesn't sound to me like she's going to be a single mom sucking off the teat of society as you'd like to make her sound.

While I'm sure *every* question hasn't been answered, it seems a pretty relevant one was - What did he want, and did his family see that through?

Yes. There are many more factors other than their mother's marital status that affect a person's chances for living a good life.

So you think that there might be a will along the lines of " I hereby leave my sperm..."
 
That actually happens, as a matter of fact, albeit rarely. With the advent of in vitro technology, a new branch of law came about covering the production of children in the event of sudden death. Women store their eggs, men store their sperm, and yes, people leave wills directing the harvesting of both.

In this case, since I don't think he expected anything to happen to him, there probably wasn't any such legal document. The story would have mentioned it, I assume. However, it DOES say that he and his girlfriend had a child and had intended to have another before he suddenly died. I would guess that since they state that as a fact, it was probably a factor in the judge's decision, which would mean they likely offered some sort of evidence to support it, if just statements from a number of people that that had been the man's intention prior to dying.

There is "little precedent" on most issues because there are few disputes and few published opinions on the issue. That is true of most issues. It doesn't mean a judge can't act.

No.. the judge's responsibility... and his sole responsibility were to the LIVING movants before him.

Again, this was done on default. There was no appropriate basis for the judge to ruin the family's chance to harvest the sperm.

So why are you pulling that card out as tho it has some major standing in this discussion?
 
Dis, I so wish I could rep you again for that.. because it's dead on.

And in answer to PC's question... the only basis on which the judge would presume that any life existed which was to be protected was if his RELIGIOUS beliefs dictated there was.

Most people, if they didn't apply a religious test, would ask... "what is the intent of the deceased"? that would be derived either by his written instructions or the sworn or spoken statements of the family to the judge. The hospital didn't oppose the application. The family members didn't oppose the application. Would you have had the judge appoint a guardian ad litem for a life that doesn't exist and, thereby, delay the proceedings so the sperm was no longer salvageable... causing irreparable harm to the family and leaving them without any recourse?

and as Dis pointed out, this isn't about "libs"...it's about you wanting an activist judge to advance some agenda you have without legal basis to do so... the very thing you accuse libs of in the opening post... before you even knew the facts.

So, if it isn't about not wanting judicial activism...

and it isn't about religion, I'm not sure what bothers you about this other than that she's going to be a single mother.

Do you think single women who get pregnant should have abortions?

No... I know you don't.

They seem to be a loving, grieving family who lost a beloved 31 year old man and want to effectuate his wishes.

So what's the objection?
 
 
I think I should be able to rent a female convict, force her to be impregnated with the sperm of the dead man of my choosing, and then have her baby delivered c-section (hey, it's just a fetus, so no harm no foul) and brought to me in my home.

Can you ever just stick to the conversation, or do you have to continually go off the deep end about something that has no relevance whatsoever, and just sounds utterly ridiculous?
 
 
If your fathered by a dead guy does that make you a Zombie or something!? Cool! but creepy!

Thank you for giving the board further insight to exactly how retarded you actually are.

Can you ever just stick to the conversation, or do you have to continually go off the deep end about something that has no relevance whatsoever, and just sounds utterly ridiculous?
 
It's what we're talking about. It's a shame you're too narrow minded to see it.
 
 
 
 
Sherman said he was not aware of any cases like this one in New York. "There is very little precedent," the judge said after the 10-minute hearing.

Nevertheless, Sherman ruled in favor of the family.

"There is no basis, as far as I know, not to let them do this," he said. "Under this kind of tragic circumstances, this is all that is left for them."

With no precedent, the judge should have shown a sense of responsibility for the future progeny, far more inportant than the "wishes" of the prospective mother.
 
There is "little precedent" on most issues because there are few disputes and few published opinions on the issue. That is true of most issues. It doesn't mean a judge can't act.

No.. the judge's responsibility... and his sole responsibility were to the LIVING movants before him.

Again, this was done on default. There was no appropriate basis for the judge to ruin the family's chance to harvest the sperm.
 
No, experience requires me to disagree.

How many times have we seen activist judges actually infract statutes and even the Constitutuion?

And here is acually a good reason to deny an applicant, especially when admitting that there is no precedent to refute.

It has NOTHING to do with what we're talking about, and you're too narrow-minded and selfish to see THAT.

This is about a couple that loved each other, were in the process of planning a WEDDING, they had a child together, they wanted another child together, both families knew and acknowledged that, and everyone was in agreement. Nobody went behind anyone elses back. Do you think for a second that if it weren't such a unanimous decision on everyones part, a judge would have allowed such a thing to take place?

You only see what you want to see, which doesn't have anything to do with actual events.
 
 
 
 
 
There is no potential child yet.

And potential life has no rights. You might not like that. But it's fact.

Again, no one opposed the application. It wasn't the judge's place to insert his own religious beliefs... assuming he would agree with you.
 

Wha???

What religious rights? Who, besides yourself, brought up religious rights?

This is a question of the best possible life for the child. You libs can't conceive (pun intended) of being deprived of whatever you wish, no matter the ramifications.
 
You truly HATE liberals, don't you... especially for 'getting whatever they want whenever they want it, no matter the ramifications'... hmm... some personal issues maybe?
 
In careful consideration as a result of your post, I must state that I don't hate anyone.

I don't expect you to read my many posts, but you would see that I have principled and thought out reasons for disagreement.

With liberals, I merely would like them to act like adults and, and as good parents do with respect to raising their children, sometimes do what may not be easiest or best for themselves, but act in accordance with the best interest of their children, or, in this case, society.

I am saddened, though, when I see adults doing what appeals to them at the moment, without careful consideration. This is acceptable when choosing a new car, but not when making a decision that bodes ill for the future of their child.

Clear?
 
 
You sound like I hurt your feelings or something, pinhead.

It's about setting a precedent. And it's not a good precedent to set.

But then, neither is legalized abortion in the name of family planning, or embryonic harvesting.

PC - Where's your link showing that the judge, and all family members from both sides a Liberals? Or, is this just an assumption on your part, and a further assumption that because they're Mexican, they're on welfare, and therefore going to suck off society (you made a reference about society picking up the tab earlier)?

And while we're at it, what makes you qualified to determine who can and can not have children, or be a single parent? I know PLENTY of single parents (some just on this board alone) who make better parents by themselves, than full-fledged families.
 
 
Well, I'm not a lawyer, but it could very well be that if no one whatsoever was protesting this, and whoever the executor of his estate/owner of his corpse in agreement, the judge might not actually have had any choice under the law but to render this judgement. I'd have to ask someone.

First, this is not a case of, as they used to say, a "card carrying commie."

To behave as a liberal is to be, for the purposes of this event, a liberal. You know, the old "walks like a duck, etc." Giving more weight to the feelings of this prospective mom than to the future of the child is not a conservative way to behave. I say this based on studies which show that, for example, the majority of those in prison come from single mom homes.

For the purposes of this discussion, giving in to this request without the consideration for the future of the child, or of society if this were to be precedent setting, is a liberal way of thinking.

Thus, a demand for a 'link' which shows a picture of the judge and the label 'liberal' is beyond necessary. But since he is a "Bronx judge," you can bet he is a Democrat. Enough?

Now, as far as "is this just an assumption on your part, and a further assumption that because they're Mexican, they're on welfare, and therefore going to suck off society," don't infer where I didn't imply. What you are doing here is attempting to cloud the issue.

To review: I feel that a) there was no marriage, and so this woman does not have the same rights that would be given to a wife, and b) this judge had no precedent that required him to place another child in this situation.

I asked earlier, and again, if instead of a judge, this question were before an adoption agency, would they place a child in this situation?

"The weight of evidence indicates that the traditional family based upon a married father and mother is still the best environment for raising children, and it forms the soundest basis for the wider society."
 Experiments in Living: The Fatherless Family 

Translated, this means that children from a fatherless home are:

5 times more likely to commit suicide
32 times more likely to run away
20 times more likely to have behavioral disorders
14 times more likely to commit rape
9 times more likely to drop out of school
10 times more likely to abuse chemical substances
9 times more likely to end up in a state operated institution
20 times more likely to end up in prison"
 Divorce and Fatherhood Statistics 

Reports from the US show the effect that absence of a father has on nearly 22% of American children in a fatherless home is:

63% of youth suicides are from fatherless homes (Source: US DHHS Bureau of the census)
90% of all homeless and runaway children are from fatherless homes
85% of all children that exibit behavioral disorders come from fatherless homes (Source: Centre for Disease Control)
80% of rapists motivated with displaced anger come from fatherless homes (Source: Criminal Justice & Behaviour, Vol 14, p. 403-26, 1978)
71% of all high school dropouts come from fatherless homes (Source: National Principles Association Report on the State of High Schools.)
70% of juveniles in state-operated institutions come from fatherless homes (Source: US Dept of Justice Special Report, Sept 1988)
85% of all youths sitting in prisons grew up in a fatherless home (Source: Fulton Co. Georgia jail populations, Texas Dept. of Corrections 1992)

I think Dis' assumption that they were Mexican was in response to their last name and its seeming relevance to PC's position. Given where she lives, Dis would probably associate an hispanic name with Mexican immigrants as opposed to another group.

They may be Mexican... they could be Puerto Rican... they could be Dominican...
lots of possibilities... but which flavor of hispanic isn't relevant to Dis's point...

I didn't "make up" - I was asked and truthfully said that I assumed based on the names. Whether or not they ARE Mexican has absolutely no bearing on anything, and is simply a way for you to nitpick.

As for your "review" questions, I'm not there yet, and I also think they're irrelevant, since adoption references children already in existence, and in a lot of cases, needing specialized care, rather than just a home.

"Implies" welfare? It was clearly stated that he had at least one, if not two jobs, they were pretty much all but in possession of a piece of paper that states they're bound by law..

So, you pretty much *assumed* they were/are/will be on welfare, you assumed they're liberals simply because of what the mother asked a judge for, regardless of the fact that nobody in their entire FAMILY disputed it, including the deceased *parents* who would have had more say-so by default over the girlfriend?

Someone asked...how is this any different than her going to a sperm bank, other than the fact that this was someone she was mentally, physically, and emotionally attached to?

The judge had nothing that required him to do anything.. Nor did he have any *valid and legal* reason for denying said request of BOTH the fiancee AND THE MANS MOTHER, FATHER, BROTHER, etc.

You wasting an entire post to say something so highly ridiculous and so far-fetched it's not even fathomable, much less part of the current discussion just because you feel like you got your pigtails pulled, and the majority happens to think you're full of shit is entirely another. You're really going to compare my assumption that they're mexican to THIS:

Associated Press

NEW YORK -- A New York judge has given a woman permission to harvest her dead lover's sperm so she can still have his baby.

Johnny Quintana was only 31 when he died Thursday of an apparent heart attack.

He had wanted to have a second child with his fiancee, Gisela Marrero, but the only way to make it happen was to quickly collect his sperm, which stays fresh for only 36 hours after death.

A court order was needed because Quintana and Marrero were not yet married.

The Bronx judge said "yes" Friday with only four hours left until the deadline.

Sperm bank staffers then rushed to Jacobi Medical Center, where Quintana's body lay.

Marrero already has a 2-year-old son with Quintana.
 
 HeraldNet: Woman can harvest dead boyfriend's sperm, judge says 

I am outraged. This is not even a wife, so what right does she have to his sperm? In one fell swoop this radical judge's decision will set off a chain of reactions including a child being born into a most bizarre situation without a father and thus increasing substantially the chances that he/she would be at some point be involved with the penitentiary system.

"Various studies come up with slightly different numbers, but all the figures are grim. According to the Index of Leading Cultural Indicators, children from single-parent families account for 63 percent of all youth suicides, 70 percent of all teenage pregancies, 71 percent of all adolescent chemical/substance abuse, 80 percent of all prison inmates, and 90 percent of all homeless and runaway children." Ann Coulter, Guilty p 37-38.

Not to mention who will be financially responsible for these children born out of wedlock? It is no big accomplishment to give birth to young, even animals can do that. The challenge is too raise them in the best way possible and that includes having a mother and a father. Why do people refuse to see into the future of the children of singleparent homes? You give children a fighting chance when you bring them up in intact families.

The counterculture won on this one. Sad. Sad, indeed.
 
I'm glad it was not a same sex relationship, with the survivor going to court to harvest sperm from his departed lover's chilled cadaver, while Momma sobs......
New York is wierd enough, as it is.

I'd counsel the woman, "move on...find another man..."

"Sixty per cent of America's rapists, 72 per cent of adolescent murderers and 70 per cent of long-term prison inmates come from fatherless homes."
 CHILDREN OF SINGLE FAMILIES 

70% of juveniles in state reform institutions grew up with one or neither parent
43% of adult inmates grew up in single-parent homes
30% of children live with never-married mothers repeat a grade
22% of children who living with divorced mothers repeat a grade
compared with 12% of those living with both biological parents
 Fatherless Homes 

For instance, a study by the University of Maryland found that the best predictor of violent crime and burglary in a community is not race or poverty, it is the percentage of households without fathers. National surveys of prison inmates have found that 60 percent of American rapists, 72 percent of adolescent murderers, and 70 percent of all inmates serving long prison terms all come from homes where they grew up without their fathers.

According to data from the National Center for Health Statistics, the rate of illegitimate births in 1999 for blacks in Alabama was 67.8 percent compared to 17.2 percent for whites. These figures agree with the percentages of blacks and whites serving time and these are the data that state officials should be concerned about.

Over 50% of current inmates come from single headed families, or were raised by other family members and in foster homes.
 A Sentence of Their Own: Resources - Fact Sheet 

And while it's understood that children who grow up in a single-parent household are at a DISADVANTAGE and therefore land in prison, choosing Christianity upon entering prison is generally an attempt to OVERCOME obstacles and become a better functioning member of society.

People don't go into prison and then lose their parents. But they do go into prison and choose Christianity because it provides them with a playbook for moral and functional living.

Nice red herring, though. Too bad you use it every single time you open your mouth to blab on this subject.
 
 
Nice effort, Babble, but you didn't prove her statement with any of your links.

 
But they do go into prison and choose Christianity because it provides them with a playbook for moral and functional living.
 
Sorry, dearie...you missed my point. 80% of prison inmates are Christians before they go in.
 
 
Sure, Ravi. We all know how accurate you always are when it comes to data.
 
 
 
 
 
PC, what exactly were you implying then, when you said this: Not to mention who will be financially responsible for these children born out of wedlock?

Who is it you think is responsible for the first child now?
 
First, you made up that they were Mexican?

Next, by ignoring my 'review' questions, can I assume that you see the relevance and acquiesce to there pertinance?

Third, "children born to married couples, those born outside of marriage score lower on tests, have increased chances for committing a crime, have higher chances of living in poverty, experience more emotional and behavioral problems, are more likely to abuse drugs or alcohol, and have higher chances of becoming pregnant as teens."
 Out of Wedlock Birthrate Out of Control » The Foundry 

The reference to poverty in the quote implies welfare.
 
I didn't "make up" - I was asked and truthfully said that I assumed based on the names. Whether or not they ARE Mexican has absolutely no bearing on anything, and is simply a way for you to nitpick.

As for your "review" questions, I'm not there yet, and I also think they're irrelevant, since adoption references children already in existence, and in a lot of cases, needing specialized care, rather than just a home.

"Implies" welfare? It was clearly stated that he had at least one, if not two jobs, they were pretty much all but in possession of a piece of paper that states they're bound by law..

So, you pretty much *assumed* they were/are/will be on welfare, you assumed they're liberals simply because of what the mother asked a judge for, regardless of the fact that nobody in their entire FAMILY disputed it, including the deceased *parents* who would have had more say-so by default over the girlfriend?

Someone asked...how is this any different than her going to a sperm bank, other than the fact that this was someone she was mentally, physically, and emotionally attached to?

The judge had nothing that required him to do anything.. Nor did he have any *valid and legal* reason for denying said request of BOTH the fiancee AND THE MANS MOTHER, FATHER, BROTHER, etc.
 
I can tell that you are hot under the collar. When you calm down, you'll see that it's pretty silly to state " he had at least one, if not two jobs," since in his unfortunate condition this will have no bearing on the income of his growing family.

Did it state that the young lady had a job, or two, and if so how will you continue with same if she becomes 'infanticipating.'

Will your opinion change if you are convinced that the family will require public assistance?

As far as "request of BOTH the fiancee AND THE MANS MOTHER, FATHER, BROTHER, etc." What does this have to do with the question at hand? You can go to court and ask for the high school ring of a classmate who passed on, and the judge could throw it out of court saying that you have no standing to make this request, and might have done the same here.

And the phrase " emotionally attached to," isn't that on page 72 of the Liberal Dictionary?

My point remains that the judge should have done this as the proper way to serve the larger community. Remember...no precedent.
 
 
But after all, we are a Christian nation. It makes sense that the majority are Christian.
 
 
 
 
 
There ARE no credible studies that say single motherhood accounts for the majority of the prison population.

This is how REAL conservatives behave: they don't give a fuck about how other people live their lives.

Clear?
 
Isn't it sad when big font is the substitute for big thinking?

Now, let's read carefully. I believe the point was that the majority of inmates come from single parent households.

-Most inmates were raised in single-parent households, over 25% had parents who abused drugs or alcohol, and 37% had at least one immediate family member incarcerated.

Let me know if you need more help with this.
 
I can read just fine, but thanks for the offer. Next time I need a wingnut to misinterpret data I'll call on you.

This is what you said:

 
I say this based on studies which show that, for example, the majority of those in prison come from single mom homes.
 
Nothing you've posted backs that up. Even if you could somehow find a link that backed you up, you would not have proven that single motherhood results in life in the pen...which is what you keep implying on this thread and others.

80% of the prison population is Christian.  
 
I see the problem, you don't realize that the posts on this board require a working understanding of the English language!

As you correctly stated, I said "the majority of those in prison."

Dictionary.com: the greater part or number; the number larger than half the total (opposed to minority ): the majority of the populatio

Do you see now? My links use terms like "most," "more than half." and "prevalence..." Do you see how these terms are related to "majority"?

You know, I can almost hear you saying :Ohhhhhh."

Clear?

BTW, what was the Christian thing about?
 
 
 
 
 
Wha???

What religious rights? Who, besides yourself, brought up religious rights?

This is a question of the best possible life for the child. You libs can't conceive (pun intended) of being deprived of whatever you wish, no matter the ramifications.
 
You truly HATE liberals, don't you... especially for 'getting whatever they want whenever they want it, no matter the ramifications'... hmm... some personal issues maybe?
 
In careful consideration as a result of your post, I must state that I don't hate anyone.

I don't expect you to read my many posts, but you would see that I have principled and thought out reasons for disagreement.

With liberals, I merely would like them to act like adults and, and as good parents do with respect to raising their children, sometimes do what may not be easiest or best for themselves, but act in accordance with the best interest of their children, or, in this case, society.

I am saddened, though, when I see adults doing what appeals to them at the moment, without careful consideration. This is acceptable when choosing a new car, but not when making a decision that bodes ill for the future of their child.

Clear?
 
Well, thank you for taking the time to respond to my post.

The truth is that I do not read every single post of yours as there is quite a number of them out there; however, I've read a few to get a sense of your views. What I noticed, is that you repeatedly make every possible topic a liberal vs. conservative issue. To add to that, I've noticed an overwhelming bias against everything even remotely 'liberal' and also that you tend to label almost everything and everyone that you disagree with as 'liberal' (hence 'bad', 'disagreeable', 'evil', 'irresponsible', etc.).

I think you view your entire world in terms of 'liberal vs. conservative' and I think that it is a problem that you should deal with because: even though the USA is a large country with a sizable population, majority of the world you CAN'T view and 'analyze' in the typical US liberal vs. conservative black-n-white way... I'm sorry to say... as this seems to be your strong point.

I think this is the point where someone should introduce you to the book:

Mitchell, Brian P. 2007. Eight Ways To Run the Country: A New And Revealing Look At Left And Right. Connecticut: Praeger Publishers.

I think it might open your eyes to new realities... at least in the US context...
 
 
 
 
 
There is no potential child yet.

And potential life has no rights. You might not like that. But it's fact.

Again, no one opposed the application. It wasn't the judge's place to insert his own religious beliefs... assuming he would agree with you.
 

Wha???

What religious rights? Who, besides yourself, brought up religious rights?

This is a question of the best possible life for the child. You libs can't conceive (pun intended) of being deprived of whatever you wish, no matter the ramifications.

ROFLMNAO... Oh GOD now THAT's PRECIOUS!

One must "HATE" Liberals... when one contests their idiocy...

There's nothing more certain in this life than the CERTAINTY OF THE UNITENDED CONSEQUENCES born from the application of Left-think.

The guy dropped dead @31... not exactly spectacular genes to saddle your child with. Does it ALWAYS have to be about YOU PEOPLE?

The would-be FATHER IS DEAD. Nothing about that strikes you as inappropriate?

Sweet cherry pie...

PoliticalChic was the one who made this into a liberal vs. conservative issue yet again. That's what she does, if you haven't noticed already.

The article was not about liberals, it was about some people and some judge that made a decision. It was her, who made the 'oh them stupid liberals are at it again' comment and attempted to make it to another liberal vs. conservative (or in other words evil vs. good) thread. Read the thread - even Dis addresses that.

And yeah, from what I've read of Political Chic's posts, she does seem to have a strong distaste for everything liberal.

If she were to talk in to an adoption agency and say the same thing, would YOU deny her a child (better yet, would you deny a child a safe home) simply because she's a single parent, regardless of the fact that she's a more than adequate parent, with a more than adequate lifestyle to support another child? Or would you simply rule her out because you don't believe single women should have children?

Don't tell me what kind of argument to use. If you'd prefer not to debate me that's up to you.

No, if I was in charge of an adoption agency, she would certainly be denied adoption based on the fact that there would be no father in the home. As far as her being an "adequate parent" with an "adequate lifestyle" that is pure conjecture on your part and these were factors that the judge should have taken into account when making his decision.

You have no way of knowing that they were in the process of marriage. People in our society use the term "fiancee" quite loosely and will use that term even though there is no ring or a date.

Your whole argument is based on calling someone a freaking liberal when they're not, and if they refuse to accept it, that's on them?

There's nothing to debate when your opponent has nothing more intelligent than the "dumb liberal" stereotypical bullshit accusation which you've displayed throughout the entire thread.

You're a nut.

Oh, I see you went back and added more bullshit to your post...

First off, it's a good thing you're NOT in charge of an adoption agency, because a lot of children would be denied good, stable homes simply because of your preconceived notion of what a household should be. Do you not know any single parents? I know plenty. Their actual values and the way they live their live puts people like you and your holier than thou attitude to shame.

Second of all, it's pure conjecture on YOUR part that she is unable to care for the child she has now, and that she'll be unable to care for the other when she decides to make an attempt at having it. You simply assume every single load of shit you posted. Why? So now whatt? Because her soon to be husband died, that child should be taken away from her? What should be done with it? There is absolutely NOTHING in EITHER article (and yours wasn't even a real article!) that gives you any indication they are anything other than they say they are, or that they're going to end up in jail, on welfare, or what have you.

Third, the article clearly states they were engaged, and gives quotes from all members of a family. You seriously think shit like that is going to be staged just for the hell of it? What's to be gained?

Really.. why are you so damned prejudiced and judgmental?

I strongly disagree with you regarding single parent households, PoliticalChic-and regarding this particular case as well.
While having two parents is the traditional ideal, there are many single parents out there who work extra hard to make up for the absence of the other parent, and the kids can and do turn out just fine.
What's most important is that they are LOVED-not that they neccessarily need to have two parents.

As for this case, sounds like this couple must have had alot of love between them, that she should still want to bear the second child they had talked about having even though he's gone. Someone with that strong a heart-and from what I have read, the support of both families-may do better than alot of two-parent households where mom and dad are self-absorbed and/or dysfunctional-or just rotten parents in general.
The judge made a wise and humane decision.

BTW, what was the Christian thing about?
 
You are ignoring the "single mom homes" again. The majority of those in prison might come from single parent, single mother, single father, no parent, grandparent only, foster care, divorced mother, divorced father...but you keep lumping them all in as single mother. Why?

The entire point you are trying to advance is that single moms make people into criminals. That's just retarded.

My point about Christians. Christianity doesn't cause people to become thugs, either. But if we followed your logic, we'd have to say it did since the majority of the prison population enters as Christian.

So unless you can find a credible source that proves the majority of those raised by single mothers end up in prison you need to STFU.
 
 
The reason that there may be a high correlation between single parent homes and prison, even assuming such a correlation actually exists, is poverty.... not any problem with a single parent household. There is a high correlation between POVERTY and prison...and a high correlation between being a single mom and being dead broke.

This woman doesn't seem to be impoverished and has exactly the type of extended family/support sytem that we wish everyone had.

So what was the problem again? Other than a need to micromanage the lives of others?

Nothing, really.  

There are also a few studies out there that find the number one predictor of having a kid end up in prison is being in prison yourself.

It's fascinating in a creepy kind of way to watch someone unravel, the way you have... kind of like watching a snake shed its skin.

No cogent argument, no logic, so you attempt to fabricate. Let's begin with "conjecture on YOUR part that she is unable to care for the child she has now, and that she'll be unable to care for the other..."

Where do you find that I made any statement as to whether or not she could care for the child she has now? If I didn't make such a statement, than you would be hallucinating, wouldn't you?

"You simply assume every single load of shit you posted." Exactly what have I assumed? Are you dreaming or drinking?

"Because her soon to be husband..." Now, here we have a gal "assuming." That would be you, or do you know the date of the impending marriage? Or the location? Or is it because you say so, it must be so. How liberal of you. I believe we dispensed with the so-overused term 'fiancee' in an earlier post.

If marriage was actually in the plan, don't you question why they didn't do just that 2 years and 9 months ago (I think they have a two year old).

"...that child should be taken away from her? " Please, admit that you invented this, or I will begin to believe that psychotropic medication is your only hope.

"You seriously think shit like that is going to be staged just for the hell of it?" The term 'staged' makes it seem that so much thought and preparation went into it, but it was merely using a word, "fiancee."

I guess you don't see that just by using the term "fiancee" the young lady is saying "I know, we should have gotten married first."

But you have decided that there is something wrong with my questioning this bizarre posthumous birth-attempt, and my concern for the well being of the next child.

How very liberal of you.

NEW YORK -- A New York judge has given a woman permission to harvest her dead lover's sperm so she can still have his baby.

Johnny Quintana was only 31 when he died Thursday of an apparent heart attack.

He had wanted to have a second child with his fiancee, Gisela Marrero, but the only way to make it happen was to quickly collect his sperm, which stays fresh for only 36 hours after death.

A court order was needed because Quintana and Marrero were not yet married.

The Bronx judge said "yes" Friday with only four hours left until the deadline.

Sperm bank staffers then rushed to Jacobi Medical Center, where Quintana's body lay.

Marrero already has a 2-year-old son with Quintana.
 
 HeraldNet: Woman can harvest dead boyfriend's sperm, judge says 

I am outraged. This is not even a wife, so what right does she have to his sperm? In one fell swoop this radical judge's decision will set off a chain of reactions including a child being born into a most bizarre situation without a father and thus increasing substantially the chances that he/she would be at some point be involved with the penitentiary system.

.....

The counterculture won on this one. Sad. Sad, indeed.
 

I think you need to calm down. And I think you wingnuts need to stop stressing about other peoples lives, that you don't know anything about, except for what you read in five minutes on Newsmax.

What I got out of your post is that she had been with this man for years, they already had one child, and they were engaged. Why would I care if she wants to have a second baby by her dead fiance? That's her choice, and it sounds like he was her life partner.

Why do you give a shit? You don't know anything about her, or what kind of parent she'd make.
 
 
 
 
 
I can read just fine, but thanks for the offer. Next time I need a wingnut to misinterpret data I'll call on you.

This is what you said:
Nothing you've posted backs that up. Even if you could somehow find a link that backed you up, you would not have proven that single motherhood results in life in the pen...which is what you keep implying on this thread and others.

80% of the prison population is Christian.  
 
I see the problem, you don't realize that the posts on this board require a working understanding of the English language!

As you correctly stated, I said "the majority of those in prison."

Dictionary.com: the greater part or number; the number larger than half the total (opposed to minority ): the majority of the populatio

Do you see now? My links use terms like "most," "more than half." and "prevalence..." Do you see how these terms are related to "majority"?

You know, I can almost hear you saying :Ohhhhhh."

Clear?

BTW, what was the Christian thing about?
 
You are ignoring the "single mom homes" again. The majority of those in prison might come from single parent, single mother, single father, no parent, grandparent only, foster care, divorced mother, divorced father...but you keep lumping them all in as single mother. Why?

The entire point you are trying to advance is that single moms make people into criminals. That's just retarded.

My point about Christians. Christianity doesn't cause people to become thugs, either. But if we followed your logic, we'd have to say it did since the majority of the prison population enters as Christian.

So unless you can find a credible source that proves the majority of those raised by single mothers end up in prison you need to STFU.
 
Can I assume that you would agree with the following: "When we consider the entire inmate population, it is more likely that a prisoner was raised in a home having one adult supervisor, than a home with two"?

Nope, but she's got numbers indicating the woman and/or her kids will likely end up in prison because she's single now, through no fault, or choice of her own.

I notice the main tenet of Liberalism is that they can't stand when flaws in their behavior or characters are pointed out.

Oh no. I see another neg rep coming.

PC, you need to realize, you've been owned....(no, not by me) in this thread.... all of your arguments have been taken down and your motivation and attitude challenged....  

You are an arrogant little lady that takes a personal issue with everyone that's not a cookie-cutter replica of herself... I'm sure one day, your teenage daughter/son will tell you the same thing... you just wait... nobody likes a control freak, the least of all kids.

Just so you know... I grew up in a single-parent family. I only had my mom to rely on since the age of 4 and guess what... I'm all grown up and fine... I actually found all your blathering a little offensive.

You have no business deciding how someone elses life should play out simply because you disagree with their principles, and how they've lived their life thus far. That's not your call to make. You don't know why they didn't get married prior to having their first child, and quite frankly, it's none of your god damned business.

You've also pretty much insulted every single parent on here, either because they conceived prior to being married, or because they're now single, so therefore, in your eyes are not fit to parent another child through adoption, or any other means.

Who the hell do you think you are? Really.
 
 
 
I am saddened, though, when I see adults doing what appeals to them at the moment, without careful consideration. This is acceptable when choosing a new car, but not when making a decision that bodes ill for the future of their child.

Clear?
 
This is not something that appealed to her at some moment. She had to act fast to get permission to collect the sperm before it would no longer be viable. And remember the woman is not even pregnant yet. Now, thanks to the wise judge, she has all the time in the world to decide if she wants to go through with her and her dead boyfriend's plan to have a second child.

If you were the judge, what reasons would you give her for denying her this choice?

You've pretty much revealed yourself as a fool, making up out of whole cloth most of what you claim I stand for. I'd use the term 'liar' but that term has pretty much been appropriated by the left.

It comes down to this simple choice: do you cast your lot with this mother, who 'wishes' to have another child, or with the child yet to be conceived, who will be raised surrounded by a multitude of question marks.

At no point have you provided proof that there was a marriage in the works, that the mother has a stable life, that she has done a good job parenting the two year old, that she has a way of providing for a family.

The only proof here is that you agree with the "I want what I want, whenever I want it" philosophy. Liberal.

She has one child, and 100% of her efforts should be aimed toward this already-born child.

And the only mothers that I have insulted are those who think that motherhood is all about them, and I stand with those mothers who will deny themselves so as to give their children the best chance in life.

According to you, the judge should have not allowed the woman to get the sperm... by extension of that.... you're inviting the government to say what a woman can or cannot do with her body and what kind of family she wants to have. Aren't you the one clamoring for 'smaller government', etc.? You're contradicting yourself, PC.

I've met enough people in my life that I've felt like they should never procreate, yet I know that it is their business, their right, their decision and I have NOTHING to say to that and no right to interfere in their lives - in other words, my opinion amounts to SHIT in relations to their lives and how they should lead it. The government should only intervene with a family when a child is in obvious and provable danger of harm. Otherwise it's none of anyone's business.

That said, your opinion as to what she can/should do amounts to NADA, ZIP, ZERO and you have to get over that... Maybe you should get off USMB and pay a bit more attention to your own kids... I can't imagine how a mother of two kids can find so much time to talk shit on a message board AND do a good job raising them. You see? It sucks when someone meddles in your personal affairs... yeah, and it's correct - it's none of my damn business.

Clear now?

And the only mothers that I have insulted are those who think that motherhood is all about them, and I stand with those mothers who will deny themselves so as to give their children the best chance in life.
 
A mother who lives a reasonable life, who does not make herself into a martyr or a doormat for her kids or anyone else, who is unselfish but looks out for herself too, is a mother who gives her kids the best chance in life by setting an example of how to live a balanced life.

The only extension here is your nose, Pinocchio.

Yes, I think the judge should have denied the request. The indication that she has no legal basis for the request is that she had to go to a judge.

 
I've met enough people in my life that I've felt like they should never procreate, yet I know that it is their business, their right, their decision and I have NOTHING to say to that and no right to interfere in their lives - in other words, my opinion amounts to SHIT in relations to their lives and how they should lead it.
 
Let me try to enlighten you. Yes, it is their business, and no, you have no right to interfere in their lives. This is very different from not giving your opinion when you see wrong being done. I commend to you the great Edmund Burke, who said "All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing."

I give my opinion and the reasons for same. Notice how different this is from the behavior of liberals, whose prime directive is "don't you dare criticize anything anyone does," as embodied in phrases such as "Who the hell do you think you are."

 
The government should only intervene with a family when a child is in obvious and provable danger of harm. Otherwise it's none of anyone's business.
 
And the government should not intervene here to give permission for an egregious event.

BTW, I wholly agree with the value you state for your opinion.

 
That said, your opinion as to what she can/should do amounts to NADA, ZIP, ZERO and you have to get over that...
 
Then why have you and your ilk invested so much emotion on the opposite side? Methinks I have hit a nerve, and there must be some humanity, deep deep down, where liberals realize that not all behavior should be validated.

 
Maybe you should get off USMB and pay a bit more attention to your own kids... I can't imagine how a mother of two kids can find so much time to talk shit on a message board AND do a good job raising them.
 
Unwittingly you have announced the motto of the liberal: "silence anyone who disagrees with me."

I feel blessed with the results of my input in my children. Thank you so much for being concerned with their well-being. My blessings on you and yours, and may they bring you as much joy as mine bring me. But, speaking of our children, I think you might want to curb your language.

And since you were so concerned with how I use my time, in all modesty I must admit that this morning I met with a group of home schoolers and took them to the NYC Fire Museum, a tour I had arranged some time ago, and came back in time to answer your post.

With a little effort, you might manage your time as well.

 
You see? It sucks when someone meddles in your personal affairs... yeah, and it's correct - it's none of my damn business. Clear now?
 
As your anger seems to have sidetracked your thinking, let me remind you of the point of this thread. This single mother, raising her child to the best of her ability, now believes that the respect she wishes to pay to her lost lover, would be best represented by having his child.

With no marital status, and with the information at hand, we have no way of knowing how well she has done raising the first child, how she will suppot the one, or two children, or anything about the young lady's life, some on this board say "Go ahead, do whatever she wishes."

I say without further information, and with full consideration for the new life at question, the judge had no impetus to give in to the request.

Clear? Now, write soon.
 
 
 
 
 
Nope, but she's got numbers indicating the woman and/or her kids will likely end up in prison because she's single now, through no fault, or choice of her own.  
 
Ahem. She was always single and she and her boyfriend did have a choice. They could have gotten married before they had their first child. I

I notice the main tenet of Liberalism is that they can't stand when flaws in their behavior or characters are pointed out.

A lot of people could have gotten married before they had their first child, but didn't for whatever reason. Who are you to dictate the way the rest of their lives should play out?
 
I'm dictating nothing. You merely wish to stifle dissenting opinion. How liberal of you.

I guess the birthday present is going to be a dictionary.

Since Liberals see their view as a higher calling that that of Conservatives, they mistakenly believe that it is entirely appropriate for then to use, not logic, facts, nor accepted debating techniques, but ad hominem attacks on the physical appearance, personal history, or imaginary mental defects. Notice how the Liberal replaces intellect with emotion. This is, no doubt, based on a medieval concept of recognizing witches and demons. In fact, Liberals attempt to deal with opponents in similar fashion: recall Clarence Thomas High Tech Lynching.

Dis, on this issue, you are a liberal, or if that makes you unhappy, let's say your opinion is liberal.

What we are debating is precedent for public policy. I claim that without more information, without a better view of the life of the prespecive second child, the judge had no business acquiescing.

Wishes of the mom, or consideration for the child.

In fact, Liberals attempt to deal with opponents in similar fashion: recall Clarence Thomas High Tech Lynching.
 
I asked you a question and you ignored it...lol, now don't get all passive aggressive on us.
 

Question?

Are you asking me to respond to "Does anyone else picture PC sitting on her bed with a needle in her arm and one of Ann Coulter's books dripping into her vein?"

Is that actually your question?
 
 
 
 
 
Does anyone else notice how easy it is to have a liberal fall from an untenable level of logical argument to some personal level of smear?

Let's review:

Well, at least you called the right one a Liberal this time.. You're getting better...   Continually calling ME one just gets YOU funny looks from pretty much everyone that knows me.  
 
Dis, on this issue, you are a liberal, or if that makes you unhappy, let's say your opinion is liberal.

What we are debating is precedent for public policy. I claim that without more information, without a better view of the life of the prespecive second child, the judge had no business acquiescing.

Wishes of the mom, or consideration for the child.
 
You don't actually know what the judge looked at to make his decision. You only know it was declared that he had no viable grounds to *deny* the request.

And while my opinion on this case may be "liberal" in your opinion, at least I'm not locked in to one view just so I can keep my "conservative" tag according to your definition of the word. That's YOUR world.

In my world, there ARE actually some gray areas to be explored. Not everything is black and white.

YOU simply wanted to deny her request on your own principle alone, with no further discussion. Thus the reason you also think that single parents shouldn't be legally able to adopt. YOUR personal principles. Those don't take in to account what might be good for anyone else.

I simply hold far more conservative views than liberal views. Sue me.

See, here is another problem I have with you: you can't seem to separate what's real from what you imagine.

First:"You don't actually know what the judge looked at to make his decision" While you don't know any of this, I was the one who made the point that there are things that should be considered before the decision was made.

And the judge could deny the request for any reason. He's the judge. He has now made precedent.

There are many places where single parents are able to adopt. But thorough investigations take place to ascertain the responsibility of said adoptions. Here, it seems as though the judge simply said, "OK."

See, here's what I mean about your grip on reality:" You simply wanted to deny her request on your own principle alone, with no further discussion. "

On numerous posts I've asked for exactly that: further discussion before it is allowed, investigation as I would expect in an adoption.

And again "Those don't take in to account what might be good for anyone else."

Have someone read my arguments to you, and perhaps they will explain that that is exactly what I want.

Did you see Jilian's post: "Theoretically, he's right, I suppose."

But you've arrived on the thread after some time. We were giving out opinions as to the correctness of the outcome, not the law.

I feel that we should study the possible outcomes for the child, rather than the wishes of the adult.

In the legal JUDGEment of the JUDGE there were no grounds to deny the request, that's the fact jack.

SHOULD he have had legal grounds to deny such a request based on the one single fact that the child would presumably fatherless? IMO, no.

You're correct, I have not read the entire thread, but that's my reaction to what I've read so far.
 
 
LOL! You've had your ass whooped from here to Sunday on this thread...by me, Jillian, Dis, Ceccie and Valarie to name but a few. I fully expect you to take up Pubic's ridiculous victory declaration.

What evidence do you have to cite about this particular case that provides insight to this particular child's possible outcomes?
 
Covered well in this thread, repeated often, this is not about evidence.

Did you read the original story?

If so, did it indicate that the judge ordered any investigation into the way the prospective child would be supported? The way the mother is bringing up her child? Were, in fact, any questions asked at all?

The judge has set precedent that is this woman wants to have said child, so be it.

This is not to society's benefit, and may very well be against the best interests of a child brought into this situation.

Now, if you agree, fine. If not, also fine.

But I presume that your disagreement will not take the form that Dis regularly chooses: rather than debte, she has simply neg rep'd several times.

Such bravery.
 
 
 
LOL! You've had your ass whooped from here to Sunday on this thread...by me, Jillian, Dis, Ceccie and Valarie to name but a few. I fully expect you to take up Pubic's ridiculous victory declaration.
 
I am so glad that you made this point.

I've been waiting for it.

Liberals are so afraid of the disapproval of the herd, and feel so validated by same, that it underscores the weakness of their arguments and their character! You feel that by yourself, you are nothing, and on this I concur.

Having read much, and thought much, I need only my own validation. Thus the strength of character and principle that you might emulate.

Have you read Edmond Rostand? No? Let me help with a quote from CYRANO: I wear my adornments on my soul. Oh- I used to have a pair of gloves. But I lost one of them. Careless of me-- I left it in [Ravi's] face!...

I've read the entire thread. I've seen statistics cited but I haven't seen anything case specific. There is a big difference between the two the latter being what's credible and the former being... statistics.

 
Did you read the original story?
 
I read both of them.

 
If so, did it indicate that the judge ordered any investigation into the way the prospective child would be supported? The way the mother is bringing up her child? Were, in fact, any questions asked at all?
 
No, none of that was mentioned in the story. What did jump out at me though was that the man suddenly dropped dead and they had 36 hours before the sperm became no good. The way the story read it sounded like much of that time was eaten just getting the emergency hearing. It was a time crunch, if the judge ordered an investigation the window would have closed.

 
The judge has set precedent that is this woman wants to have said child, so be it.

This is not to society's benefit, and may very well be against the best interests of a child brought into this situation.
 
But the judge found no reason to deny the request and nobody from either family objected to it. Hell, the guy's mother was part of the driving force to get it done and it sounded like this is what the guy would have wanted.

Regarding the best interest of the child, the fact is that nobody in this thread knows what is or what isn't in the best interest of this potential child.

Are you sure you are a woman?  
 
 
PC, would you have found it acceptable if the judge had acquiesced to the request with a stipulation that the sperm be withheld from the mother until a full investigation into how the child would be supported was complete?

So now EVERYONE that disagrees with you and thinks you're wrong is a Liberal?

Is there no level to which you won't stoop in order to try to garner yourself a self-proclaimed "win"?

Seriously. That's sad.

(Oh, and "several" negs? You're a liar. 2. Stop whining.)

Oh,did I hurt you?

The post was to Ravi who implied that having several on her side resulted in " ass whooped from here to Sunday on this thread." Of course, she needs several on her side to make it fair.

I identified her as a liberal, and you feel it necessary to pick up the gauntlet. I guess you need the back-up as well. Get it: I referred to Ravi. But if you would like to be lumped in, so be it.

But I give as good as I get, no matter the number.

I didn't claim any "win," I merely consider my opinion righteous, and have defended it as such. I don't stoop to stab-in-the-back tactics, like neg reps, as you do.

Although you eschew the title 'liberal,' you immediatly use the term 'liar,' which the liberal uses to claim superiority, as though it was an actual thought.

In one day, on this thread, you have twice used neg reps twice in place of actual debate. An indication of a weak argument.

BTW, 'several' may mean more than two, but also as follows:
Dictionary.com, 'several' : several persons or things; a few; some
I await your apology.

And, I never whine.
 
 
 
PC, would you have found it acceptable if the judge had acquiesced to the request with a stipulation that the sperm be withheld from the mother until a full investigation into how the child would be supported was complete?
 
Yes.

But the point of the discussion, and, generally, the back and forth on the board, is to kick around ideas and opinions. I offered mine with the view that the judge is setting a precedent which I find not in the best interests of all concerned.

An investigation along the lines of what is de rigueur in adoptions would have made me more sanguine.

Are you sure you are a woman?  
 
The last tiime I checked. But why do you ask?
 
 
 
 
 
In careful consideration as a result of your post, I must state that I don't hate anyone.

I don't expect you to read my many posts, but you would see that I have principled and thought out reasons for disagreement.

With liberals, I merely would like them to act like adults and, and as good parents do with respect to raising their children, sometimes do what may not be easiest or best for themselves, but act in accordance with the best interest of their children, or, in this case, society.

I am saddened, though, when I see adults doing what appeals to them at the moment, without careful consideration. This is acceptable when choosing a new car, but not when making a decision that bodes ill for the future of their child.

Clear?
 
PC - Where's your link showing that the judge, and all family members from both sides a Liberals? Or, is this just an assumption on your part, and a further assumption that because they're Mexican, they're on welfare, and therefore going to suck off society (you made a reference about society picking up the tab earlier)?

And while we're at it, what makes you qualified to determine who can and can not have children, or be a single parent? I know PLENTY of single parents (some just on this board alone) who make better parents by themselves, than full-fledged families.
 

First, this is not a case of, as they used to say, a "card carrying commie."

To behave as a liberal is to be, for the purposes of this event, a liberal. You know, the old "walks like a duck, etc." Giving more weight to the feelings of this prospective mom than to the future of the child is not a conservative way to behave. I say this based on studies which show that, for example, the majority of those in prison come from single mom homes.

For the purposes of this discussion, giving in to this request without the consideration for the future of the child, or of society if this were to be precedent setting, is a liberal way of thinking.

Thus, a demand for a 'link' which shows a picture of the judge and the label 'liberal' is beyond necessary. But since he is a "Bronx judge," you can bet he is a Democrat. Enough?

Now, as far as "is this just an assumption on your part, and a further assumption that because they're Mexican, they're on welfare, and therefore going to suck off society," don't infer where I didn't imply. What you are doing here is attempting to cloud the issue.

To review: I feel that a) there was no marriage, and so this woman does not have the same rights that would be given to a wife, and b) this judge had no precedent that required him to place another child in this situation.

I asked earlier, and again, if instead of a judge, this question were before an adoption agency, would they place a child in this situation?
 

No, PC. Not clear and definitely not enough. Notice where your theories about the best interest of the child are mostly based on what YOU feel?  

There was absolutely no basis for the judge to deny the request. Period. By your logic we should outlaw divorce, I suppose?  

Typical fascist Republican! (kidding)

 
 
 
 
 
 
I am so glad that you made this point.

I've been waiting for it.

Liberals are so afraid of the disapproval of the herd, and feel so validated by same, that it underscores the weakness of their arguments and their character! You feel that by yourself, you are nothing, and on this I concur.

Having read much, and thought much, I need only my own validation. Thus the strength of character and principle that you might emulate.

Have you read Edmond Rostand? No? Let me help with a quote from CYRANO: I wear my adornments on my soul. Oh- I used to have a pair of gloves. But I lost one of them. Careless of me-- I left it in [Ravi's] face!...
 
So now EVERYONE that disagrees with you and thinks you're wrong is a Liberal?

Is there no level to which you won't stoop in order to try to garner yourself a self-proclaimed "win"?

Seriously. That's sad.

(Oh, and "several" negs? You're a liar. 2. Stop whining.)
 
Oh,did I hurt you?

Not in the least - you don't hold that power.

The post was to Ravi who implied that having several on her side resulted in " ass whooped from here to Sunday on this thread." Of course, she needs several on her side to make it fair.

I identified her as a liberal, and you feel it necessary to pick up the gauntlet. I guess you need the back-up as well. Get it: I referred to Ravi. But if you would like to be lumped in, so be it.

You have called ME a liberal no less than half a dozen times in the last two days. And you still do in this particular response, as well. That is the gauntlet I choose to pick up and slap you with.

But I give as good as I get, no matter the number.

When do you start?

I didn't claim any "win," I merely consider my opinion righteous, and have defended it as such. I don't stoop to stab-in-the-back tactics, like neg reps, as you do.

Nope.. When you're losing, you stoop to to standard right wingnut tactics like referring to your opponents as "liberals" as if that's a crushing blow in and of itself. Epic fail, m'dear.

Although you eschew the title 'liberal,' you immediatly use the term 'liar,' which the liberal uses to claim superiority, as though it was an actual thought.

I called you a liar for stating I gave you "several negs" - I gave you two. Standard definition for "several" is at least 3.

In one day, on this thread, you have twice used neg reps twice in place of actual debate. An indication of a weak argument.

In TWO days I have TWICE neg repped you - one for insinuating single people should never be allowed to adopt on that criteria alone, and one for trolling, and constantly using the term "liberal" as an attempt to get a rise, rather than sticking to the topic at hand, and putting forth your *facts* (none of which you had).

BTW, 'several' may mean more than two, but also as follows:
Dictionary.com, 'several' : several persons or things; a few; some
I await your apology.

My dear, hell will freeze over before I apologize for calling you exactly what you are - a liar.

And, I never whine.
 
What, exactly, do you call this?
 
 
It'll be a cold day in the morgue if some woman comes to snatch my body parts after I'm dead.

PC - Where's your link showing that the judge, and all family members from both sides a Liberals? Or, is this just an assumption on your part, and a further assumption that because they're Mexican, they're on welfare, and therefore going to suck off society (you made a reference about society picking up the tab earlier)?

And while we're at it, what makes you qualified to determine who can and can not have children, or be a single parent? I know PLENTY of single parents (some just on this board alone) who make better parents by themselves, than full-fledged families.
 

First, this is not a case of, as they used to say, a "card carrying commie."

To behave as a liberal is to be, for the purposes of this event, a liberal. You know, the old "walks like a duck, etc." Giving more weight to the feelings of this prospective mom than to the future of the child is not a conservative way to behave. I say this based on studies which show that, for example, the majority of those in prison come from single mom homes.

Do all of the single mothers/fathers on here deserve hearing/seeing you say that they're not fit to adopt a child simply because they're unwed?

Oh, and if "this" is the best you've got, save yourself the effort, and use it against the next person that's going to stomp all over your weak-assed selfish arguments.

Doesn't bother me a bit-----she's a damn sperm swiper.
 
 
 
 
PC, would you have found it acceptable if the judge had acquiesced to the request with a stipulation that the sperm be withheld from the mother until a full investigation into how the child would be supported was complete?
 
Yes.

But the point of the discussion, and, generally, the back and forth on the board, is to kick around ideas and opinions. I offered mine with the view that the judge is setting a precedent which I find not in the best interests of all concerned.

An investigation along the lines of what is de rigueur in adoptions would have made me more sanguine.
 
I guess what has me trippin' about your point that a precedent has been set is that nobody challenged the request. I mean, I'm not a lawyer or anything but if a similar case were to come up and the family of the deceased were to challenge the request could their argument be thrown out because of this ruling? I'm not so sure that's what would go down. What I suspect would happen is what I just suggested in my last post, acquiesce but withhold the sperm until an investigation, etc.
 
 
 
 
 
I didn't "make up" - I was asked and truthfully said that I assumed based on the names. Whether or not they ARE Mexican has absolutely no bearing on anything, and is simply a way for you to nitpick.

As for your "review" questions, I'm not there yet, and I also think they're irrelevant, since adoption references children already in existence, and in a lot of cases, needing specialized care, rather than just a home.

"Implies" welfare? It was clearly stated that he had at least one, if not two jobs, they were pretty much all but in possession of a piece of paper that states they're bound by law..

So, you pretty much *assumed* they were/are/will be on welfare, you assumed they're liberals simply because of what the mother asked a judge for, regardless of the fact that nobody in their entire FAMILY disputed it, including the deceased *parents* who would have had more say-so by default over the girlfriend?

Someone asked...how is this any different than her going to a sperm bank, other than the fact that this was someone she was mentally, physically, and emotionally attached to?

The judge had nothing that required him to do anything.. Nor did he have any *valid and legal* reason for denying said request of BOTH the fiancee AND THE MANS MOTHER, FATHER, BROTHER, etc.
 
I can tell that you are hot under the collar. When you calm down, you'll see that it's pretty silly to state " he had at least one, if not two jobs," since in his unfortunate condition this will have no bearing on the income of his growing family.

Did it state that the young lady had a job, or two, and if so how will you continue with same if she becomes 'infanticipating.'

Will your opinion change if you are convinced that the family will require public assistance?

As far as "request of BOTH the fiancee AND THE MANS MOTHER, FATHER, BROTHER, etc." What does this have to do with the question at hand? You can go to court and ask for the high school ring of a classmate who passed on, and the judge could throw it out of court saying that you have no standing to make this request, and might have done the same here.

And the phrase " emotionally attached to," isn't that on page 72 of the Liberal Dictionary?

My point remains that the judge should have done this as the proper way to serve the larger community. Remember...no precedent.
 
If you want to continue this conversation, drop the liberal vs. conservative bullshit with me. I don't play it.
 

ROFL... "Don't Label me MAN!" LOL... Isn't it cool how the left can't STAND Truth in lableing?

Cracks me up.

That's what my girlfriend always says!!
 
 
 
It'll be a cold day in the morgue if some woman comes to snatch my body parts after I'm dead.  
 
You'd better get that written into your will. then again judges have broken wills and trusts pretty regularly. Maybe you should just take care of the issue prior to death.

Whatever gets you through the night.  

So WHY do you think the JUDGE in his legal JUDGEment didn't agree with you?

So insecure, that you are constantly trying to drag others, as in "single mothers/fathers on here," in to back up what has been shown as a weak, self-centered, insipid defense of what you see as the all-powerful desire for wish-fulfillment of this person, about whom you know nothing.

Since you have difficulty in focusing, I'll remind you that my position is that a responsible judge should have investigated the situation into which he was placing the soon-to-be child.

Your respose has been DISappointing and DISreputable.

This from the whiney child who labels everyone that disagrees with her a liberal, or a lefty? Pul-ease, woman.  

Wish fulfillment? The judge had no grounds to deny her request - it's as simple as that. You twisting, turning, and playing word games doesn't change that one simple *FACT*. Had it simply been *her* request, you *might* have a leg to stand on. But, as it is, the deceased' family was just as much of a driving force, and the request was based on the mans own wishes - period.

Tell me something.. What was your opinion on pulling the plug on Terri Schiavo?

As for the adoption things - your words, sweetheart. Single parents should not be allowed to adopt children. Stating such implies that they're unfit parents. Well, how many of them do you post with, and did you insult when you stated such?

Your ass has been handed to you on more than a dozen occasions in the span of 48 hours. Get over it, and move on.

No answer, what a surprise. I aced logic. Another fact, jack...MORE THAN A FEELING. Now, try answering the question.

HOW do you reconcile your logic as it pertains to the law depriving THIS woman her request with those who seek legal divorce? Your argument is based on how you FEEL the judge should have ruled, based on stats about children of single mothers. Speaking of blather?  

Please explain to my obviously simple, illogical and insecure mind, HOW does your reasoning not logically translate to outlawing divorce? Answer or divert. I'll wait for your enlightenment.
 
 
 
 
LOL! You've had your ass whooped from here to Sunday on this thread...by me, Jillian, Dis, Ceccie and Valarie to name but a few. I fully expect you to take up Pubic's ridiculous victory declaration.
 
I am so glad that you made this point.

I've been waiting for it.

Liberals are so afraid of the disapproval of the herd, and feel so validated by same, that it underscores the weakness of their arguments and their character! You feel that by yourself, you are nothing, and on this I concur.

Having read much, and thought much, I need only my own validation. Thus the strength of character and principle that you might emulate.

Have you read Edmond Rostand? No? Let me help with a quote from CYRANO: I wear my adornments on my soul. Oh- I used to have a pair of gloves. But I lost one of them. Careless of me-- I left it in [Ravi's] face!...
 
Whatever, PC. There is no herd in this opinion that you are full of shit...just a bunch of disparate posters that can see right through you. But, whatever floats your boat. You and Ann against the world, making up lies about single moms. I'm sure she's proud of you.

Thus, a demand for a 'link' which shows a picture of the judge and the label 'liberal' is beyond necessary. But since he is a "Bronx judge," you can bet he is a Democrat. Enough?

Now, as far as "is this just an assumption on your part, and a further assumption that because they're Mexican, they're on welfare, and therefore going to suck off society," don't infer where I didn't imply. What you are doing here is attempting to cloud the issue.

To review: I feel that a) there was no marriage, and so this woman does not have the same rights that would be given to a wife, and b) this judge had no precedent that required him to place another child in this situation.

I asked earlier, and again, if instead of a judge, this question were before an adoption agency, would they place a child in this situation?
 

No, PC. Not clear and definitely not enough. Notice where your theories about the best interest of the child are mostly based on what YOU feel?  

There was absolutely no basis for the judge to deny the request. Period. By your logic we should outlaw divorce, I suppose?  

Typical fascist Republican! (kidding)

 
 
Why I do believe FEELING is one of those liberal traits she puts down.   Holy shit, she is what she hates the most...a flaming Progressive.
 
 
 
It'll be a cold day in the morgue if some woman comes to snatch my body parts after I'm dead.  
 
Talk about stating the obvious...lol. If only you were so lucky.  
 
 
 
 
 
I FEEL a judge who I FEEL is responsible would not FEEL it unimportant to "investigate"  

Tell me PC, do you support judges mandating birth control too? What about DIVORCE? How do you FEEL about divorce and it's affect on society and the children ?

By your logic we should outlaw divorce, no?  
 
I guess you can't handle the import of this thread, so you FEEL the need to add some blather?

And you actually FEEL that you can comprehend my logic? Doesn't seem so. Try to stay in your league, you'll FEEL better about yourself.
 
No answer, what a surprise. I aced logic. Another fact, jack...MORE THAN A FEELING. Now, try answering the question.

HOW do you reconcile your logic as it pertains to the law depriving THIS woman her request with those who seek legal divorce? Your argument is based on how you FEEL the judge should have ruled, based on stats about children of single mothers. Speaking of blather?  

Please explain to my obviously simple, illogical and insecure mind, HOW does your reasoning not logically translate to outlawing divorce? Answer or divert. I'll wait for your enlightenment.
 
The logic is as simple as you are: attempting to bring up extraneous, peripheral and unrelated material must mean that you have given up confronting my point,
 
 
 
 
 
First, this is not a case of, as they used to say, a "card carrying commie."

To behave as a liberal is to be, for the purposes of this event, a liberal. You know, the old "walks like a duck, etc." Giving more weight to the feelings of this prospective mom than to the future of the child is not a conservative way to behave. I say this based on studies which show that, for example, the majority of those in prison come from single mom homes.

For the purposes of this discussion, giving in to this request without the consideration for the future of the child, or of society if this were to be precedent setting, is a liberal way of thinking.

I throw it back in your two faces.

Why do you refuse to give full consideration to the situation into which the child-to-be will be born?

Why are the 'feelings' of the prospective mother the only 'feelings' under consideration?

Why are the 'feelings' of the prospective mother the only 'feelings' under consideration?

And finally, why do you care?

So you have no reconciliation for your opinion?  

You want to play make pretend only when it suits you?  

 
Having read much, and thought much, I need only my own validation.
 
Yet, you haven't even considered the correlation of your OP as it relates to single motherhood and divorce or even further...abortion?  

Extraneous, peripheral and unrelated? Is that how you FEEL?

Try supporting your own logic. Single-mother-bad = Single-mother-bad.  

I'm too stupid to get it, please help.

It seems that you have no clue how lacking in reason your response is. Biological function? How does this bear on her the subject?

Again:I'll remind you that my position is that a responsible judge should have investigated the situation into which he was placing the soon-to-be child.

Biological function? The judge should have said, oh, you have the biological function so go ahead and have a child??? That's a legal decision??? Taken to a far off conclusion, should she have the right to choose the semen of anyone she chooses, at any time, because its "a biological function"?

I should have realized that discussing a serious topic with one as limited as you have provern to be is pointless. But I must admit it's fun slapping you around.

Now, a primer for your edification:
Liberals and Conservatives differ in the way to proceed. For Conservatives, data informs policy. (“More Guns, Less Crime” and“Mass murderers apparently can’t read, since they are constantly shooting up ‘gun-free zones.’”- Coulter) We use Conservative principles to the best of our ability, but when confronting new and original venues, we believe in testing, and analysis of the results of the tests. For liberals, feeling passes for knowing; it is based on emotion often to the exclusion of thinking.

See how you are the 'poster child' for this kind of thinking?

Yep, a biological urge to be a mother is a valid argument.

PC, you're a skank. Your opening post was written to bash liberals. You've no idea if this woman is a liberal or not. I don't know what led you to that conclusion...her hispanic name, the fact she was unmarried...I suspect only that you don't agree with her is all it took.

You used this woman and her grief to bash not only liberals but also single mothers. You're trash.

If you could admit it you would at least earn some respect.

And your regurgitation of Coulter's talking points makes you trash without a brain of your own.

Exactly the response I expected, honestly, you're so predictable.

The first attack by your side, early in this thread, was that she has every right, and nobody objected so the judge had to give in to her request.

Now you want to feign that he investigated before he decided, even though the news reports focus on how quickly the decision had to be made.

Busted.

Why don't you just answer the questions put forth to you? Do you have any indication that he didn't investigate anything?

Any person on the planet has every right to make any request they wish - it's called freedom of speech. Whether or not those requests are granted is another matter entirely.

The decision had to be made quickly. How long, exactly, do you think it takes to verify employment, and do a criminal background check? 5 minutes, toots. 5 of them. What else would you have him verify? TWO families were willing to care for this child. In fact, she even said she doesn't know when she'll do the insemination process, other than "when the time is right".

Who the fuck are you to decide you can dictate the outcome of someone elses life?

You really can't contend with my argument, can you. There is no counterpoint in your post, so it must really mean "I'm so frustrated and angry that I don't know what to do..."

I'll remind you that my position is that a responsible judge should have investigated the situation into which he was placing the soon-to-be child. So far, I haven't seen any ability on your part to counter it.

I used to think, when I read vapid posts like yours, "she can't be this devoid of intellect," but you've convinced me that you certainly can.

BTW, I'm sure the term 'skank' has some personal meaning for you, but I'm unfamiliar with it. Could it be some archaic form of liberal smear?

Why should the judge rule no in this case?

The guy wanted to have another child before he died, his next of kin were fine with it.

Why should the decision be up to the state?

Why, when there are next of kin readily available, should the state suddenly own the remains of someone and get to decide what to do with it?

Shouldn't whoever owns the body (and attached sperm) be allowed to dictate what happens to it or would it be all right for states to act like every corpse is their possession?

I mean hey you get to decide in a will what happens to your earthly remains (car goes to kids, wife gets house etc.). Why should sperm, blood etc suddenly belong to the state? Why should they have a right to take it from you when it's obviously worth something?

If you have the time to read the entire thread, you will see that this has been covered.
The couple in question were not married, and there is no precedent here.

By point is simply that the judge should have asked for an investigation similar to that which is done in the case of adoptions.

No, it has NOT been covered, PC. The mans NEXT OF KIN (that would be his parents and brother, mind you) asked the judge for this - not JUST his fiancee.

The NEXT OF KIN should have the ultimate say-so, especially if the mans own wishes were readily known, and his family was in keeping with that.

I am outraged. This is not even a wife, so what right does she have to his sperm? In one fell swoop this radical judge's decision will set off a chain of reactions including a child being born into a most bizarre situation without a father and thus increasing substantially the chances that he/she would be at some point be involved with the penitentiary system.

"Various studies come up with slightly different numbers, but all the figures are grim. According to the Index of Leading Cultural Indicators, children from single-parent families account for 63 percent of all youth suicides, 70 percent of all teenage pregancies, 71 percent of all adolescent chemical/substance abuse, 80 percent of all prison inmates, and 90 percent of all homeless and runaway children."

Not to mention who will be financially responsible for these children born out of wedlock? It is no big accomplishment to give birth to young, even animals can do that. The challenge is too raise them in the best way possible and that includes having a mother and a father. Why do people refuse to see into the future of the children of singleparent homes? You give children a fighting chance when you bring them up in intact families.

Know what... Nevermind. Pretty much everyone thinks you're full of BS. No point in arguing further. You're wrong. Simple as that. G'day.
 

"Pretty much everyone..."

Your argument is reduced to "see, everyon likes me and noone likes you, so there!"

I can't begin to tell you how convincing that is.

BTW, here's some evidence that "Pretty much everyone" isn't quite the case:
Dr. Laura believes that appropriate parenthood honors the child's needs first. Problems frequently arise, when this does not happen. It is unfortunate that people sometimes have children for all the wrong reasons. They procreate to heal something within themselves. They erroneously think that having children will solve their problems. When they finally see this mistake it is often too late; they are left disappointed, and the children are the ones who suffer.
In Dr. Laura's experience, women allow themselves to get pregnant, because they think that it will all work out in the end. She also finds that women fail to accept responsibility for their own bodies, and they allow themselves to get pregnant without giving it proper thought.

LOL! You've had your ass whooped from here to Sunday on this thread...by me, Jillian, Dis, Ceccie and Valarie to name but a few. I fully expect you to take up Pubic's ridiculous victory declaration.
 
I am so glad that you made this point.

I've been waiting for it.

Liberals are so afraid of the disapproval of the herd, and feel so validated by same, that it underscores the weakness of their arguments and their character! You feel that by yourself, you are nothing, and on this I concur.

Having read much, and thought much, I need only my own validation. Thus the strength of character and principle that you might emulate.

Have you read Edmond Rostand? No? Let me help with a quote from CYRANO: I wear my adornments on my soul. Oh- I used to have a pair of gloves. But I lost one of them. Careless of me-- I left it in [Ravi's] face!...
 
Whatever, PC. There is no herd in this opinion that you are full of shit...just a bunch of disparate posters that can see right through you. But, whatever floats your boat. You and Ann against the world, making up lies about single moms. I'm sure she's proud of you.
 
Dis and Valerie liberals?!?!?!?!

And why bother actually reading about the limitations of a judge's power under circumstances like this? I mean... it's only reality... and that can be ignored at will, right?

I wouldn't mind so much except for the extreme disingenuousness of the OP which accuses the judge of being activist...

it now has become clear that the complaint is not that the judge was an activist "liberal" judge, but is, in reality, a complaint that the judge is not an activist judge at all but stayed within the constraints of the facts before him.

What I'm really wondering, having read the articles, having heard about the case here and at work.... why on earth is this a "liberal"-"conservative" issue at all.

Answer: it isn't...
 
 
 
 
 
Not quite.  

WHY don't you just admit you know nothing about this family and the FACTS involved with THIS case that the judge legally reviewed and subsequently dismissed and admit the rest of your blather is just an excuse to post your "single-mother-bad" mantra?  
 
Why don't you admit that your are, intellectually speaking, blind.

And what is it that you claim to know about this family?

As for the facts of the case, I know as much as anyone who read the news reports, nothing more.

What's humorous is that you know nothing, but you are absolutely certain that I am wrong.
Blind? None so as those who will not see.

I'll remind you that my position is that a responsible judge should have investigated the situation into which he was placing the soon-to-be child.

And your objection would be...?
 
And I'll remind you of your ACTUAL position as posed in your OP:

 
I am outraged. This is not even a wife, so what right does she have to his sperm? In one fell swoop this radical judge's decision will set off a chain of reactions including a child being born into a most bizarre situation without a father and thus increasing substantially the chances that he/she would be at some point be involved with the penitentiary system.

"Various studies come up with slightly different numbers, but all the figures are grim. According to the Index of Leading Cultural Indicators, children from single-parent families account for 63 percent of all youth suicides, 70 percent of all teenage pregancies, 71 percent of all adolescent chemical/substance abuse, 80 percent of all prison inmates, and 90 percent of all homeless and runaway children."

Which reasons are those? It is my opinion that the judge used good judgment in this case. WHY do you FEEL he didn't, I wonder?

No.

There are many places where single parents are able to adopt. But thorough investigations take place to ascertain the responsibility of said adoptions. Here, it seems as though the judge simply said, "OK."

 
It's not possible to adopt sperm.

You are coming dangerously close to suggesting that what this judge really should have ruled on - and denied - was her right to become pregnant.
 
 
 
 
 
Do you have any indication that he DIDN'T?
 

Exactly the response I expected, honestly, you're so predictable.

The first attack by your side, early in this thread, was that she has every right, and nobody objected so the judge had to give in to her request.

Now you want to feign that he investigated before he decided, even though the news reports focus on how quickly the decision had to be made.

Busted.
 
Why don't you just answer the questions put forth to you? Do you have any indication that he didn't investigate anything?

Any person on the planet has every right to make any request they wish - it's called freedom of speech. Whether or not those requests are granted is another matter entirely.

The decision had to be made quickly. How long, exactly, do you think it takes to verify employment, and do a criminal background check? 5 minutes, toots. 5 of them. What else would you have him verify? TWO families were willing to care for this child. In fact, she even said she doesn't know when she'll do the insemination process, other than "when the time is right".

Who the fuck are you to decide you can dictate the outcome of someone elses life?

Busted.
 
     
 
 
 
Now you want to feign that he investigated before he decided, even though the news reports focus on how quickly the decision had to be made.
 
Didn't his family also testify that his wishes were to have another child with the mother of his first?

Yes, they did. But that wasn't in HER story (which was just a paragraph). It was in an additional story that was posted, that she never indicated she bothered reading. She won't address anything in that "other" story link. His mother actually begged the judge to let this happen.

Oh c'mon, Anguille, don't you dare even "attempt to bring up extraneous, peripheral and unrelated material" !!   It must mean that "you have given up confronting {my} point. "

 

It's only LOGICAL.

 
 
 
 
 
Why should the judge rule no in this case?

The guy wanted to have another child before he died, his next of kin were fine with it.

Why should the decision be up to the state?

Why, when there are next of kin readily available, should the state suddenly own the remains of someone and get to decide what to do with it?

Shouldn't whoever owns the body (and attached sperm) be allowed to dictate what happens to it or would it be all right for states to act like every corpse is their possession?

I mean hey you get to decide in a will what happens to your earthly remains (car goes to kids, wife gets house etc.). Why should sperm, blood etc suddenly belong to the state? Why should they have a right to take it from you when it's obviously worth something?
 

If you have the time to read the entire thread, you will see that this has been covered.
The couple in question were not married, and there is no precedent here.

By point is simply that the judge should have asked for an investigation similar to that which is done in the case of adoptions.
 
Bullshit. Judges are not social workers. He had a legal obligation to make a decision quickly based on rule of law. Which he did. The man's family made no objection and there was zero basis to deny the request. I applaud this judge for actually using his brain and not his, or anyone else's moral compass. He didn't need an investigation, be had all the acts he needed right in front of him.

Well, considering you haven't made a rational argument on this thread yet, I would welcome something that even approximates challenging...

Why don't you just stop futzing around and admit that you think a Judge should decide that this woman shouldn't become pregnant because she doesn't meet your standard for suitability... you know, being she's hispanic and all...
 
 
The judge ruled within the scope of the law. Simple.
 
 
What gets me, and why I think PC is dead wrong on this, is that the guy's family was behind this. I mean, nobody with the power to do so challenged it. As a matter of fact wouldn't they have had to put the request in, show up to court, sign documents, etc?

It would be an entirely different story if the dude's family refused to file the paperwork and the chic tried to get the judge to force it through. But that just didn't happen here. I don't understand how this would set any kind of precedent. What precedent would that be exactly? I really don't think that because this judge granted this request any woman who has a BF die on them can now just harvest his sperm without getting family approval.

So what is the real beef here?

If it's a matter of conern for the welfare of the child and the judge thought that needed to be addressed, he could do what I suggested earlier in the thread. However, I haven't seen any credible evidence that shows that was warranted in this case. All I've seen is opinion.

PC won't even *acknowledge* the fact that the guys family wanted this. She's so fixated on the mother, and what she's "not" entitled to, and the fact that she's a single mother with a child to see anything else.

She doesn't have a valid point. All she has is robotic textbook views, and Coullter quotes. Take either, or both of those away from her, and she's like a fish out of water.
 
 
 
 
 
Not quite.  

WHY don't you just admit you know nothing about this family and the FACTS involved with THIS case that the judge legally reviewed and subsequently dismissed and admit the rest of your blather is just an excuse to post your "single-mother-bad" mantra?

In error on so many points.

Judges often ask for reports based on investigations by adoption and other social service agencies.

Why have you attempted to 'beg the question' by inserting "quickly"? What's the rush? Sperm can be maintained indefinately.

The basis for denial might have been to consider said reports.

What he had before him, according to DISreputable, is "begging."
 
 
 
 
 
No.
 

Yeah, they are.

Ah, the icing on the cake. Sometimes a poster, like yourself, is so foolish she doesn't realize that their post punctures their own argument.

My argument is certainly rational. For your edification, rational means "having or exercising reason, sound judgment, or good sense."

My position is simply that the judge should have asked for an investigation similar to that which is done in the case of adoptions.

Your side has advanced thinking such as "it's a biological function," or the family "begged," or simply that she want it so let her have it.

Can you pick out the rational argument? Carefull, this is an IQ test.

And here it comes: "...you know, being she's hispanic and all..."

Wow, we are so lucky to have a liberal always ready to defend the poor, the minority, the defensless...

First, the only one to mention minority status was your side, DISreputable, to engender some kind of support from, I guess minorities, and second...
who is more defenseless than this unborn, prospective sibling to her two year old????

Let's remind everyone what you wrote:
"PC, would you have found it acceptable if the judge had acquiesced to the request with a stipulation that the sperm be withheld from the mother until a full investigation into how the child would be supported was complete? " Article15
 
 
 
Why should the judge rule no in this case?

The guy wanted to have another child before he died, his next of kin were fine with it.

These are good questions and I don't know the answer. I assumed it was because he was dead and there are laws in place to decide what can be done to a corpse. Otherwise I can't see a logical reason that a judge was involved at all.

It would be an entirely different story if the dude's family refused to file the paperwork and the chic tried to get the judge to force it through. But that just didn't happen here. I don't understand how this would set any kind of precedent. What precedent would that be exactly? I really don't think that because this judge granted this request any woman who has a BF die on them can now just harvest his sperm without getting family approval.

So what is the real beef here?

If it's a matter of conern for the welfare of the child and the judge thought that needed to be addressed, he could do what I suggested earlier in the thread. However, I haven't seen any credible evidence that shows that was warranted in this case. All I've seen is opinion.
 
PC won't even *acknowledge* the fact that the guys family wanted this. She's so fixated on the mother, and what she's "not" entitled to, and the fact that she's a single mother with a child to see anything else.

She doesn't have a valid point. All she has is robotic textbook views, and Coullter quotes. Take either, or both of those away from her, and she's like a fish out of water.
 
Wow, this has been fun.

I hope folks on both sides have the time, and interest, to read this whole thread, over 200 posts!

I have presented a cogent, rational thesis, that in this precedent setting case our sights and those of the judge should have considered the prospective life that might be created at least as much as the the wished of the prospective mother.

That's it.

Your side has been reduced to irrational statements and vile language and neg reps, spcifically you, DISreputable, and suggested that I leave the board, or STFU.

I have no objection to being the 'lightning rod" for this discussion and in fact, feel like Leonidas at Thermopylae.
 
 
 
Ah, the icing on the cake. Sometimes a poster, like yourself, is so foolish she doesn't realize that their post punctures their own argument.

My argument is certainly rational. For your edification, rational means "having or exercising reason, sound judgment, or good sense."

My position is simply that the judge should have asked for an investigation similar to that which is done in the case of adoptions.

Your side has advanced thinking such as "it's a biological function," or the family "begged," or simply that she want it so let her have it.

Can you pick out the rational argument? Carefull, this is an IQ test.

And here it comes: "...you know, being she's hispanic and all..."

Wow, we are so lucky to have a liberal always ready to defend the poor, the minority, the defensless...

First, the only one to mention minority status was your side, DISreputable, to engender some kind of support from, I guess minorities, and second...
who is more defenseless than this unborn, prospective sibling to her two year old????

Trouble being consistent, or simply taking the oppotunity to advance your side of the culture war?
 
I have to admit to being amused by someone who would have a heart attack if government interfered with her right to misinform her children that the world is 6,000 years old but wants a court to impose IT'S morality on this family.

Is it that you think anyone but you should be told what to do? You know, that whole noblesse oblige thing?

Or is it that you can't admit you were hoisted on your own petard and created a stupid thread but now can't back down.

I'm figuring that's it...

what i do know is you've embarrassed yourself here... and proven to all of us that you aren't nearly as smart as you think you are.

man, that so must suck for you. I have to admit admiration for your tenacity, though... no matter how absurd your position....

*edit* and you've even changed THAT position... the OP started with your insanely rabid annie coulter impression
 
I am outraged. This is not even a wife, so what right does she have to his sperm? In one fell swoop this radical judge's decision will set off a chain of reactions including a child being born into a most bizarre situation without a father and thus increasing substantially the chances that he/she would be at some point be involved with the penitentiary system
 
so it was her singleness that was the problem for you then... no investigation needed. she's still single...and it still isn't government's business.

can i take it that you think all single women who get pregnant should be forced to have abortions by activist judges, too? you know, that way there are no kids to be " potentially involved with the penitentiary system".
 
 
 
I in fact, feel like Leonidas at Thermopylae.

 

   

         
 
 
Humor break!

This case brings a whole new meaning to the age-old dilemma of "spit or swallow?"

 
 
 
 
 
 
Now you want to feign that he investigated before he decided, even though the news reports focus on how quickly the decision had to be made.
 
Didn't his family also testify that his wishes were to have another child with the mother of his first?
 

If the family had been the sole determinor, why did they go before a judge?
 
I assume it's because the hospital or morgue where the boyfriend's body was being kept wanted a judge to grant her permission to absolve them of any responsability in case his family did object.

 
I'll remind you that my position is that a responsible judge should have investigated the situation into which he was placing the soon-to-be child.

And your objection would be...?
 
He did investigate. His legal heirs were present and had no objection. You make no sense when you try to equate some sperm, what you refer to as a "soon-to-be-child" (who hasn't even been conceived yet!!! ) with a real live child up for adoption.

Should all women go before judges before becoming pregnant to get permission to do so?
 
 
 
who is more defenseless than this unborn, prospective sibling to her two year old????
 
  About as defenceless as Oliver Twist or any other fictional character.
 
 
 
 
 
If you have the time to read the entire thread, you will see that this has been covered.
The couple in question were not married, and there is no precedent here.

By point is simply that the judge should have asked for an investigation similar to that which is done in the case of adoptions.
 
Bullshit. Judges are not social workers. He had a legal obligation to make a decision quickly based on rule of law. Which he did. The man's family made no objection and there was zero basis to deny the request. I applaud this judge for actually using his brain and not his, or anyone else's moral compass. He didn't need an investigation, be had all the acts he needed right in front of him.
 
In error on so many points.

Judges often ask for reports based on investigations by adoption and other social service agencies.

Why have you attempted to 'beg the question' by inserting "quickly"? What's the rush? Sperm can be maintained indefinately.

The basis for denial might have been to consider said reports.

What he had before him, according to DISreputable, is "begging."
 
Prety sure I have a better handle on what Judges do and don't do. But hey its your story, tell it how you want. It is it the Judge's discretion whether or not there is an investigation. He didn't feel he needed one. By your argument, people should have to go before a Judge to be investigated before getting pregnant. Sounds ridiculous doesn't it? Well so does your argument.

So I'll tell you what. Point me to case law that shows that Judge was in error. If you can show me where the Judge's decision fails legally, I will switch sides and argue on your behalf. I'll be waiting patiently.

Since you have claimed the niche of 'legal expert,' why don't you tell me how you will take the position that judges are never in error.

And you have seriously weaked you hold on the niche by inferring where I didn't imply. Bad choice of argument; I think I'll chose another lawyer.

But I will accept your "expert testimony" when you say "It is it the Judge's discretion whether or not there is an investigation." Thanks for supporting my argument.

And as far as "...I will switch sides and argue on your behalf," thanks anyway, but it doesn't appear that I need your help.

I have to admit to being amused by someone who would have a heart attack if government interfered with her right to misinform her children that the world is 6,000 years old but wants a court to impose IT'S morality on this family.
 
Either admit that you cannot support the absurd and totally fabricated charge above, that I have argued against "government interfered with her right to misinform her children that the world is 6,000 years old," or show where I have said same.

You are now forced to admit that everything I stated about you in the previous post is beyond argument, as you are reduce to making up charges. I believe yours is known as a 'straw man' argument.

My point is simply that the judge should have asked for an investigation similar to that which is done in the case of adoptions. Can you remember that?

Better yet, write it down so you don't have to fabricate things.

you were hysterical at the thought of the government telling you not to homeschool or how to homeschool...that includes your right to pass on absurd and extreme religious dogma.

and you started with a rant about activist judges. yet in reality, you were not ranting because the judge was activist... you were ranting because the judge was NOT activist.... and wouldn't get on your annie coultergeist worshipping high horse.

you got caught in a rant about a subject on which you had insufficient information about which to draw any conclusion whatsover...

and now you've gotten your butt kicked by everyone on this thread and you've dug in your heels and won't admit that you were totally off base.

good effort at deflection though..
 
 
 
Since you have claimed the niche of 'legal expert,' why don't you tell me how you will take the position that judges are never in error.
 
Did he use the word expert? I don't believe so. He said he was in a better position than you to have a handle on whether the judge was right or wrong. He is. As am I... as are the judges with whom I've discussed this case since your rant was posted. If this were about the wit and wisdom of Annie Coutergeist, I'm sure we'd defer to your clear expertise on the subject.

 
But I will accept your "expert testimony" when you say "It is it the Judge's discretion whether or not there is an investigation." Thanks for supporting my argument.
 
He didn't support your argument. didn't your mother ever tell you it's really rude to try to misrepresent what people say?

 
And as far as "...I will switch sides and argue on your behalf," thanks anyway, but it doesn't appear that I need your help.
 
again, quite the leap... he said IF you could prove us wrong. you haven't.

aren't you getting dizzy yet?

First, the term 'hysterical,' is that a slur against women? Look it up.

Second, I've never been 'hysterical.'

Third, 'that includes,' means that you are about to fabricate again.

And the part where I write in a thread about things I know nothing about? Here comes a shoe that seems to fit you, try it on.

"The Brisbane Supreme Court has denied an Australian womans request to harvest and freeze her dead fiancés sperm for future impregnation."
 Woman wants dead fiance's baby: who owns a dead man's sperm -- Spriggs 30 (4): 384 -- Journal of Medical Ethics 

It seems not all judges feel the way your judge did. Kind of obviates all of your posts, huh?
What was that part about posting on a topic you know nothing about?

"Brisbane Supreme Court Justice John Byrne last week granted the woman the right to have the man's sperm frozen until it is decided whether it can be used."
 Woman needs court approval to use dead partner's sperm - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) 

...until it is decided...

From Cyrano: "And then, as I end the refrain, thrust home!"
 
 
your point? the australian court said the woman in question needed a court order. they did here, too. and they GOT a court order. and? not that australia law applies.. but still...

you're really reaching. try not to hurt yourself with those contortions.

as for the etymology of the word hysterical.. i think we can agree that the word can apply to both men or women.
 
 
 
Since you have claimed the niche of 'legal expert,' why don't you tell me how you will take the position that judges are never in error.
 
I wouldn't take that position. Judges are in error all the time. Hell, I don't agree with about 98% of the shit that comes out of the ninth circuit. What you cannot seem to have a grasp on is the way these judges make decisions. That don't ask for your opinion and they don't ask for the opinion of every voter, or person who put them on that bench for advice.

 
And you have seriously weaked you hold on the niche by inferring where I didn't imply. Bad choice of argument; I think I'll chose another lawyer.
 
I don't even know what this means.

 
But I will accept your "expert testimony" when you say "It is it the Judge's discretion whether or not there is an investigation." Thanks for supporting my argument.
 
Yep, it is the judge's discretion. He could have ordered an investigation. But why would he? The case had an expiration date. The girlfriend, her parents, and the departed's parents were all in the court room telling the judge that they were all okay with this decision. Hell, the judge was only invovled in order to aleviate the hospital from the possibility of litigation. Also, was this man an organ donor? If so, then that is the only legal basis the Judge needed for his decision.

 
And as far as "...I will switch sides and argue on your behalf," thanks anyway, but it doesn't appear that I need your help.
 
Oh you need a helluva alot of help. Your problem is that you are looking at this form a moral standpoint. You are ignoring the fact that there is a difference between law and justice. You may not agree with the procedure of removing a dead man's sperm for later insemination, but that matters not in the context of the law. This man made a fair conservative judgement. He put his beliefs(whatever they may be) and obviously yours in his hip pocket and made a sound judgement based on rule of law. He didn't legislate from the bench or make laws up on the fly to support his decison. All judges should act this way.

What is the "point of law," if there is no precedent?

The point is so simple that it is hard to believe that you missed it, so it must be a fairly transparent way of disguising your errors. Hard swallowing a crow whole?

This judge took his time and did as Art15 suggested, and I agreed was the best course, earlier:
"PC, would you have found it acceptable if the judge had acquiesced to the request with a stipulation that the sperm be withheld from the mother until a full investigation into how the child would be supported was complete?" Article15

This is way it was handled by a more 'traditional' judge. I guess that is the end of every post in this thread that claimed that it couldn't be handled in any other way.

And if you sourced the provenance of 'hysteria,' you know:Originally defined as a neurotic condition peculiar to women and thought to be caused by a dysfunction of the uterus.
 
 
 
I agree with a lot of what you say, but what is the "expiration date"?

What is the "point of law," if there is no precedent?
 
The expriration date is a reference to the fact that they had to move quick. Otherwise the sperm harvested wouldn't have been usable. The way I understand it, there is small window to harvest such things once the person is departed.

As for point of law, precendents on this matter only apply to cases in which there is a respondent( an opposing party). There was no repondent in this case. It was unopposed. How many cases can you name where a Judge ruled in favor of non-existent respondent. I can't name any. So, what grounds did he have to deny the request? None.

Sperm can be frozen indefinitely. There have been normal pregnancies from sperm stored frozen for 12 years. The efficacy of the freezing is questionable when it has been frozen for more than 12 years. Each individual's sperm reacts differently to the freezing process. The result of the thawed test batch can give you some indication of how your sperm reacts to the process.
 How long can you effectively keep my frozen sperm? 

The judge could have handled it two other ways:
1- Claimed that there is no common law marriage in NY, and thus the women had no standing.

Seriously. Australian law doesn't apply here. You need to find US case law, otherwise drop that argument. We aren't in Sidney.

As for common law marriage, yeah the Judge could have gone that route, but why would he and how would it change your argument if they were married? You rargument is essentially that she would be a single mom. Stupod argument at best and doesn't change if they are married. His next of kin were willing to surrender the rights to teh sperm to her, so that argument doesn't really apply either.

And the frozen part. Yes, I know that sperm can be frozen for a long time, howver they had not harvested yet. Did you not read the article that you posted? They needed the court order before they could harvest.

So now what. We are back to no respondent. Therefore the Judge alowed the order due no objections against it. You seem to be the only person in the world to give a shit.
 
 
the title of this thread makes my balls ache. I'll be glad when you bitches are done here and back int he kitchen making me some pie.
 
 
 
 
What gets me, and why I think PC is dead wrong on this, is that the guy's family was behind this. I mean, nobody with the power to do so challenged it. As a matter of fact wouldn't they have had to put the request in, show up to court, sign documents, etc?

It would be an entirely different story if the dude's family refused to file the paperwork and the chic tried to get the judge to force it through. But that just didn't happen here. I don't understand how this would set any kind of precedent. What precedent would that be exactly? I really don't think that because this judge granted this request any woman who has a BF die on them can now just harvest his sperm without getting family approval.

So what is the real beef here?

If it's a matter of conern for the welfare of the child and the judge thought that needed to be addressed, he could do what I suggested earlier in the thread. However, I haven't seen any credible evidence that shows that was warranted in this case. All I've seen is opinion.
 
Let's remind everyone what you wrote:
"PC, would you have found it acceptable if the judge had acquiesced to the request with a stipulation that the sperm be withheld from the mother until a full investigation into how the child would be supported was complete? " Article15
 
You are ignoring 90% of my post and you are ignoring the second half of the exchange where you got that quote from.

 
 
 
PC, would you have found it acceptable if the judge had acquiesced to the request with a stipulation that the sperm be withheld from the mother until a full investigation into how the child would be supported was complete?
 
Yes.

But the point of the discussion, and, generally, the back and forth on the board, is to kick around ideas and opinions. I offered mine with the view that the judge is setting a precedent which I find not in the best interests of all concerned.

An investigation along the lines of what is de rigueur in adoptions would have made me more sanguine.
 
I guess what has me trippin' about your point that a precedent has been set is that nobody challenged the request. I mean, I'm not a lawyer or anything but if a similar case were to come up and the family of the deceased were to challenge the request could their argument be thrown out because of this ruling? I'm not so sure that's what would go down. What I suspect would happen is what I just suggested in my last post, acquiesce but withhold the sperm until an investigation, etc.
 
The bolded text you never responded to nor did you respond to post #134.

Please keep what I say in full context. You have ignored more than half of what I've posted in this thread but are using my words like they are some kind of silver bullet.

 How long can you effectively keep my frozen sperm? 

The judge could have handled it two other ways:
1- Claimed that there is no common law marriage in NY, and thus the women had no standing.

Seriously. Australian law doesn't apply here. You need to find US case law, otherwise drop that argument. We aren't in Sidney.

As for common law marriage, yeah the Judge could have gone that route, but why would he and how would it change your argument if they were married? You rargument is essentially that she would be a single mom. Stupod argument at best and doesn't change if they are married. His next of kin were willing to surrender the rights to teh sperm to her, so that argument doesn't really apply either.

And the frozen part. Yes, I know that sperm can be frozen for a long time, howver they had not harvested yet. Did you not read the article that you posted? They needed the court order before they could harvest.

So now what. We are back to no respondent. Therefore the Judge alowed the order due no objections against it. You seem to be the only person in the world to give a shit.
 

What is the matter with you? I didn't say to apply foreign law, I said that here was another way to handle it that had actually been done.
Get it?

Drop the argument? Does that mean "opposition shouldn't be heard"? Where did you learn that law?

What argument, I gave a reasoned opinion, documented that it is possible and has been accomplished elsewhere.

Yes, if they had been married it would obviate the entire post. I would not impose, nor would the article be in the paper, if it involved marital rights. One major difference is that we would know that the father had committed to the woman.

Simple discussion, I have given my opinion and shown that it is both possible and has been done elsewhere.

All of you on the other side are screaming that you don't want to hear this opinion. So?
I guess in your kind of fascist America it wouldn't be heard. And I'd be in a re-education camp. Doesn't that make you think twice about your 'weltanschaung'?
 
 
 
 
 
What gets me, and why I think PC is dead wrong on this, is that the guy's family was behind this. I mean, nobody with the power to do so challenged it. As a matter of fact wouldn't they have had to put the request in, show up to court, sign documents, etc?

It would be an entirely different story if the dude's family refused to file the paperwork and the chic tried to get the judge to force it through. But that just didn't happen here. I don't understand how this would set any kind of precedent. What precedent would that be exactly? I really don't think that because this judge granted this request any woman who has a BF die on them can now just harvest his sperm without getting family approval.

So what is the real beef here?

If it's a matter of conern for the welfare of the child and the judge thought that needed to be addressed, he could do what I suggested earlier in the thread. However, I haven't seen any credible evidence that shows that was warranted in this case. All I've seen is opinion.
 
PC won't even *acknowledge* the fact that the guys family wanted this. She's so fixated on the mother, and what she's "not" entitled to, and the fact that she's a single mother with a child to see anything else.

She doesn't have a valid point. All she has is robotic textbook views, and Coullter quotes. Take either, or both of those away from her, and she's like a fish out of water.
 
Wow, this has been fun.

I hope folks on both sides have the time, and interest, to read this whole thread, over 200 posts!

I have presented a cogent, rational thesis, that in this precedent setting case our sights and those of the judge should have considered the prospective life that might be created at least as much as the the wished of the prospective mother.

That's it.

Your side has been reduced to irrational statements and vile language and neg reps, spcifically you, DISreputable, and suggested that I leave the board, or STFU.

I have no objection to being the 'lightning rod" for this discussion and in fact, feel like Leonidas at Thermopylae.
 
People HAVE read the entire thread - all 200 posts, and as they filter in, more and more are telling you that you're fucking crackers. We're at what. 6-8 people now, and half of them are pretty much defined as conservatives?  

Oh, and did I mention you're a liar? Nowhere did I state that you should leave the board, or STFU. I said you should stop trolling, and that you're the type of person that gives us conservatives a bad name. I suggest if you're going to make such a baseless accusation, you at least fabricate something that maybe LOOKS like it confirms your statement?

That's what.. 2-3 times you've flat out lied now? That the best you've got?    
 
 
hmmm...it was I that told her to stfu unless she produced evidence that the majority of children raised by single mothers ended up in prison...which I asked her after I asked her the question she wouldn't answer....why does she lump all those groups (single fathers, single mothers, grandparents raising children, foster care children, divorced fathers, divorced mothers, etc) in to one big group she calls single mothers?

I guess we all look alike to her.

I don't know if it's comprehension or just an unwillingness to learn. And if some "liberal, activist judge" (which was her initial rant) ever had the temerity to insert him or herself into HER life by deciding if and when she could become pregnant, she'd have a nervous breakdown and spew all of this board. You'd see threads about "llib" judges, "lib" courts, "lying lawyers"

perhaps we should make the hypothetical more real to her so she finally *gets* it...

person A is no longer able to express his wishes. his live in love and partner of many years and he wanted one more child and wanted to protect the sperm... but the treatment for whatever ails person A will kill his ability to father children. because he is unable to express his wishes, and she is not legally married to him, a court order is needed and they go to court for what should be a fairly simple, unopposed application to remove and freeze his sperm. The judge, hearing that the parties' other child was home schooled, decides to do an "investigation" for the best interests of the sperm... (the very thought that we're talking about the best interests of sperm and not the desires of the person is seriously making my stomach turn)

but what do you think? you think she's lose her mind?

I do.

It's clear that she thinks law is simply a function of a judge imposing his or her will on litigants, regardless of the appropriate ruling.... so long as that ruling effectuates her own agenda and prejudices. She's also disingenuous in trying to say that the requirement of a court order somehow differed here and elsewhere.

Mostly, she thinks her prejudices should be enacted into our common law

And i'm still waiting for her to tell us if she demands that all single pregnant women have abortions.

PC is what we would call a shit house lawyer. PC simply does not understand that in order to deny the request, someone would have had to respond. There is no respondent in this case, so therefore there is no case. It is simply a matter of the sperm bank covering their own ass against possible litigation.

She is forgetting that the parents of the departed approved of this. As the next of kin, they have the right to the sperm and were relinquishing that right to the petitioner. It is that simple. There is no debate here. PC is trying to argue her own morality with the law and she is failing. Seriously, what the fuck does an Australian Supreme Court decision have to do with this Judge's decision? Nothing. Her argument fails on every turn and she is obviously too thick to see it.

You are a crude, foul-mouthed low-life, and prove same with every post.

I never lie.

No doubt if I asked you to quote where I quoted you as saying I should leave the board, you would be unable to find same. But if I were you, the term 'liar' would leap to my lips. But, thankfully, I am not you.

I never lie. Nor do I fabricate.

But I've often noticed that the other side will accuse one of doing the malicious things that they do.

Nor do I use gutter language, nor neg reps. When I disagree, I do it in the light of day. And, along those lines, as Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis said, sunlight is the best disinfectant. Although, in your case, I would add that actual disinfectant might not be a bad idea either.

This is part of post # 98, one of your supporters named Neser Boha:
"That said, your opinion as to what she can/should do amounts to NADA, ZIP, ZERO and you have to get over that... Maybe you should get off USMB and pay a bit more attention to your own kids... I can't imagine how a mother of two kids can find so much time to talk shit on a message board AND do a good job raising them. You see? It sucks when someone meddles in your personal affairs... yeah, and it's correct - it's none of my damn business."

If you had any class you would retract the slur, but of course the only class you have is low.
 
 
Let me get this straight... you want to hold Dis responsible for something said by someone who happend to agree with a point she made?

And you want her to retract a purported slur made by said someone who happened to agree with a point she made?

Good luck with that.

"... in order to deny the request, someone would have had to respond."

But here are two quotes which indicate other directions the judge could have taken:

"Yep, it is the judge's discretion. He could have ordered an investigation."

Do you require everything spelled out for you?

Now I know you feel the need to support your bud, but heres the deal. She said I claimed that she told me to leave the board. I did not.

I said that those on your side did certain things, such as tell me to leave the board.

And I just proved it.

Get it?

To review: she said I said something which I did not, I proved same, and you injected yourself in because you thought I was bullying your clique. How funny is that.

I love it, almost 300 posts in the thread, me against all of you, and I guess you feel I've been picking on your gang!!!

Wow, I am woman, hear me roar!
 
 
clique?

dude, you have no clue about the dynamic on this board.

trust me...we are bonding over thinking you're meshugganah.

And I seem to recall you accusing her of telling you to leave the board, too. I just can't be bothered to go look for it right now.

As I said, I have to admire your tanicity, even in the face of your having been humiliated on this thread.

But you are delusional if you think you've looked anythig but beaten...
 
 
Hey, PC, you might be in luck. Chances are this women hasn't impregnated herself yet. Why don't you round up a crowd, make some signs and picket in front of her house?

Not quite there junior, because the Judge had no reason to. The only way he would have gone those routes is in the instance of a respondent arguing against the petition. There was no respondent therefore he had no reason to explore those options. He acted within the law. Simple as that. You are dismissed.

P.S. Nice use of the taking quotes out of context tactic. Didn't work though. Too bad.

Yes, if they had been married it would obviate the entire post. I would not impose, nor would the article be in the paper, if it involved marital rights. One major difference is that we would know that the father had committed to the woman.

 
So single women to whom men have at one time been committed in marriage are exempted from your claim that single women cannot effectively raise children? Sounds like more of your a woman should not have children unless a man has given his approval of her.

I am outraged. This is not even a wife, so what right does she have to his sperm? In one fell swoop this radical judge's decision will set off a chain of reactions including a child being born into a most bizarre situation without a father and thus increasing substantially the chances that he/she would be at some point be involved with the penitentiary system.

" Various studies come up with slightly different numbers, but all the figures are grim. According to the Index of Leading Cultural Indicators, children from single-parent families account for 63 percent of all youth suicides, 70 percent of all teenage pregancies, 71 percent of all adolescent chemical/substance abuse, 80 percent of all prison inmates, and 90 percent of all homeless and runaway children." Ann Coulter, Guilty p 37-38.

Not to mention who will be financially responsible for these children born out of wedlock? It is no big accomplishment to give birth to young, even animals can do that. The challenge is too raise them in the best way possible and that includes having a mother and a father. Why do people refuse to see into the future of the children of singleparent homes? You give children a fighting chance when you bring them up in intact families.

The counterculture won on this one. Sad. Sad, indeed.
 
If you wouldn't have felt this way had they been married, why did you add all the stuff in your OP that I underlined above? When the person is dead, the end result is a single parent either way.  
 
 
I just found it funny that she's so melted down that she needed to fix my typos.

thanks for that. i couldn't be bothered going over it myself.

So single women to whom men have at one time been committed in marriage are exempted from your claim that single women cannot effectively raise children? Sounds like more of your a woman should not have children unless a man has given his approval of her.
 
No, it's not a question of approval.

The premise is that to give a child the best possible chance in life is to be born into a committed relationship with loving parents. Stats pretty much bear this out.

If a woman waits to have children until she is married, then for one reason or another no longer has the husband, then she has done the best she could for the child, and she will do the best to then raise that child.

What brings about the most vilification from some of the board members is that I will not say that it's fine if a woman has children with a man who will not make the commitment to the family that is represented by marriage.

Now watch how many angry posts there are when I state how I feel about day-care.

I am outraged. This is not even a wife, so what right does she have to his sperm? In one fell swoop this radical judge's decision will set off a chain of reactions including a child being born into a most bizarre situation without a father and thus increasing substantially the chances that he/she would be at some point be involved with the penitentiary system.

" Various studies come up with slightly different numbers, but all the figures are grim. According to the Index of Leading Cultural Indicators, children from single-parent families account for 63 percent of all youth suicides, 70 percent of all teenage pregancies, 71 percent of all adolescent chemical/substance abuse, 80 percent of all prison inmates, and 90 percent of all homeless and runaway children." Ann Coulter, Guilty p 37-38.

Not to mention who will be financially responsible for these children born out of wedlock? It is no big accomplishment to give birth to young, even animals can do that. The challenge is too raise them in the best way possible and that includes having a mother and a father. Why do people refuse to see into the future of the children of singleparent homes? You give children a fighting chance when you bring them up in intact families.

The counterculture won on this one. Sad. Sad, indeed.
 
If you wouldn't have felt this way had they been married, why did you add all the stuff in your OP that I underlined above? When the person is dead, the end result is a single parent either way.

OUT of the night that covers me,
Black as the Pit from pole to pole,
I thank whatever gods may be
For my unconquerable soul.

In the fell clutch of circumstance

Under the bludgeonings of chance
My head is bloody, but unbowed.

Beyond this place of wrath and tears
Looms but the Horror of the shade,

How charged with punishments the scroll,

I am the captain of my soul.

Yes, you are a coward. You feel very strongly that this woman should not be allowed to bear her dead lover's child. And yet you are afraid to start the ball rolling to prevent it.
 
 
The judge, made his ''judgement'' and ruled on this particular case....that's all that happened PC.

The judge took these circumstances in to consideration...

- The dead man's sperm needed harvesting within 3 days of his death.

- No law was writen by congress preventing such action.

- The dead man had a long term relationship with his girlfriend.

- The dead man also had a child, conceived with this woman, so she was the mother of his one child already.

- The dead man's will was to have another child, based on witnesses, including the dead man's mom.

- The dead man's blood relatives did NOT object.

- AND if any objection arose after the harvesting of this sperm, there was legal means for those objecting to redress the grievences...

The judge, if he ruled in ANY OTHER MANNER, would have been writing laws from the BENCH, judicial ACTIVISM....pc?

CERTAINLY you are against judicial activism, making law from the bench?

I understand, to a degree your concerns of the ''what ifs''....

AS EXAMPLE of my own ''what ifs'':

What if this were a man's girlfriend, who he did have a child with already and who he did tell he wanted another child with...

That ALSO had a wife with 2 of his children as well, who objected to the harvesting of his sperm for his mistress to have another of his children with....

THE JUDGE, would have to rule according to THESE circumstances, and more than likely, his ruling would have been DIFFERENT according to THOSE circumstances because the wife would have all legal decisions with her as next of kin....as his legal wife and the judge would have to rule, according to law and the wife would be favored in this dispute.

Now you want to feign that he investigated before he decided, even though the news reports focus on how quickly the decision had to be made.
 
Didn't his family also testify that his wishes were to have another child with the mother of his first?
 

If the family had been the sole determinor, why did they go before a judge?

I'll remind you that my position is that a responsible judge should have investigated the situation into which he was placing the soon-to-be child.

And your objection would be...?
 
Well, not being privy either to the actual case records or the laws of that state, I can only guess, but I'd say that since the circumstances were so unusual, the medical personnel involved wouldn't perform the procedure without a court ruling.

And no, the judge had no legal standing to "investigate" anything except whether or not there was anyone in the family objecting, or any legal basis for blocking the procedure.
 
 
 
 
 
If you have the time to read the entire thread, you will see that this has been covered.
The couple in question were not married, and there is no precedent here.

By point is simply that the judge should have asked for an investigation similar to that which is done in the case of adoptions.
 
Bullshit. Judges are not social workers. He had a legal obligation to make a decision quickly based on rule of law. Which he did. The man's family made no objection and there was zero basis to deny the request. I applaud this judge for actually using his brain and not his, or anyone else's moral compass. He didn't need an investigation, be had all the acts he needed right in front of him.
 
In error on so many points.

Judges often ask for reports based on investigations by adoption and other social service agencies.

Why have you attempted to 'beg the question' by inserting "quickly"? What's the rush? Sperm can be maintained indefinately.

The basis for denial might have been to consider said reports.

What he had before him, according to DISreputable, is "begging."
 
Adoption and social services take place in another court under another set of laws and circumstances. In this case, there is no applicable law for what you're talking about, and to order such an investigation would have been a massive overstepping of the judge's bounds.

And no, the sperm had to be harvested within a certain amount of time, and apparently, the medical personnel were balking at harvesting it at all.
 
 
 
The judge, made his ''judgement'' and ruled on this particular case....that's all that happened PC.

The judge took these circumstances in to consideration...

- The dead man's sperm needed harvesting within 3 days of his death.
 
And as we saw in Brisbane, could have been stored awaiting a future decision.

 
- No law was writen by congress preventing such action.

- The dead man had a long term relationship with his girlfriend.
 
I never said there was a law, and the point of my post is that the judge has set an unfortunate precedent. Relationship is correct, it is a committment that is missing.

 
- AND if any objection arose after the harvesting of this sperm, there was legal means for those objecting to redress the grievences...
 
I didn't see any reference in the article and insemination could be immediate.

 
The judge, if he ruled in ANY OTHER MANNER, would have been writing laws from the BENCH, judicial ACTIVISM....pc?
 
Exactly what he did: he set precedent.

My concern is that a child did not have to be born into what is a less than ideal situation.

care[/QUOTE]
 
 
 
 
 
I agree with a lot of what you say, but what is the "expiration date"?

What is the "point of law," if there is no precedent?
 
The expriration date is a reference to the fact that they had to move quick. Otherwise the sperm harvested wouldn't have been usable. The way I understand it, there is small window to harvest such things once the person is departed.

As for point of law, precendents on this matter only apply to cases in which there is a respondent( an opposing party). There was no repondent in this case. It was unopposed. How many cases can you name where a Judge ruled in favor of non-existent respondent. I can't name any. So, what grounds did he have to deny the request? None.
 

Incorrect:
Sperm can be frozen indefinitely. There have been normal pregnancies from sperm stored frozen for 12 years. The efficacy of the freezing is questionable when it has been frozen for more than 12 years. Each individual's sperm reacts differently to the freezing process. The result of the thawed test batch can give you some indication of how your sperm reacts to the process.
 How long can you effectively keep my frozen sperm? 

The judge could have handled it two other ways:
1- Claimed that there is no common law marriage in NY, and thus the women had no standing.
2.-"The Brisbane Supreme Court has denied an Australian womans request to harvest and freeze her dead fiancés sperm for future impregnation. "
 Woman wants dead fiance's baby: who owns a dead man's sperm -- Spriggs 30 (4): 384 -- Journal of Medical Ethics 
 
Political, what part of "they wouldn't harvest the sperm without a court order" are you having trouble with? Sperm can only be frozen and stored AFTER it's out of the guy's body, and THAT was the procedure she was getting the court order for.

And while no one denies that the judge could have ruled the other way if he so chose, there was really no legal reason to do so, since no one, apparently, was objecting. In fact, every interested party to the case was supporting this woman.
 
 
 
 
 
Yes, if they had been married it would obviate the entire post. I would not impose, nor would the article be in the paper, if it involved marital rights. One major difference is that we would know that the father had committed to the woman.

 
So single women to whom men have at one time been committed in marriage are exempted from your claim that single women cannot effectively raise children? Sounds like more of your a woman should not have children unless a man has given his approval of her.
 
No, it's not a question of approval.

What brings about the most vilification from some of the board members is that I will not say that it's fine if a woman has children with a man who will not make the commitment to the family that is represented by marriage.

Now watch how many angry posts there are when I state how I feel about day-care.
 
The problem with this is that at this moment, there is no child involved. Therefore, the laws concerning placement of children don't apply. What we are actually talking about, in legal terms, is performing a medical procedure on a dead body. We're not talking about family law here. There is absolutely no law allowing the judge to make determinations on whether or not a woman is a fit parent enough to become pregnant.

As near as I can tell, the only legal precedent he had to work with was that governing things liike the harvesting of bodily organs for transplant, which requires the approval of the next of kin. And while I'm not a lawyer and can't say for sure, it seems to me that without any respondent to object, the legal precedent is to rule in favor of the plaintiff. I know that's what happens in other types of legal cases when the respondent doesn't show up to court.
 
 
 
 
 
What gets me, and why I think PC is dead wrong on this, is that the guy's family was behind this. I mean, nobody with the power to do so challenged it. As a matter of fact wouldn't they have had to put the request in, show up to court, sign documents, etc?

It would be an entirely different story if the dude's family refused to file the paperwork and the chic tried to get the judge to force it through. But that just didn't happen here. I don't understand how this would set any kind of precedent. What precedent would that be exactly? I really don't think that because this judge granted this request any woman who has a BF die on them can now just harvest his sperm without getting family approval.

So what is the real beef here?

If it's a matter of conern for the welfare of the child and the judge thought that needed to be addressed, he could do what I suggested earlier in the thread. However, I haven't seen any credible evidence that shows that was warranted in this case. All I've seen is opinion.
 
Let's remind everyone what you wrote:
"PC, would you have found it acceptable if the judge had acquiesced to the request with a stipulation that the sperm be withheld from the mother until a full investigation into how the child would be supported was complete? " Article15
 
You are ignoring 90% of my post and you are ignoring the second half of the exchange where you got that quote from.

 
 
Yes.

But the point of the discussion, and, generally, the back and forth on the board, is to kick around ideas and opinions. I offered mine with the view that the judge is setting a precedent which I find not in the best interests of all concerned.

An investigation along the lines of what is de rigueur in adoptions would have made me more sanguine.
 
I guess what has me trippin' about your point that a precedent has been set is that nobody challenged the request. I mean, I'm not a lawyer or anything but if a similar case were to come up and the family of the deceased were to challenge the request could their argument be thrown out because of this ruling? I'm not so sure that's what would go down. What I suspect would happen is what I just suggested in my last post, acquiesce but withhold the sperm until an investigation, etc.
 
The bolded text you never responded to nor did you respond to post #134.

Please keep what I say in full context. You have ignored more than half of what I've posted in this thread but are using my words like they are some kind of silver bullet.
 
Are you suffering a 'senior moment'?

Context is defined as : the parts of a discourse that surround a word or passage and can throw light on its meaning.

In using your suggestion, I did not cut anything or use just a part. I used your entire post #136 exactly as you posted it, In its entirety.

Further, I gave you full credit for same. You wrote it, not I.

If you meant silver bullet as "The metaphor of the silver bullet applies to any straightforward solution perceived to have extreme effectiveness. The phrase typically appears with an expectation that some new technology or practice will easily cure a major prevailing problem," it seems pretty clear as I responded 'yes' when you asked it.

Here is the post # 136:
"PC, would you have found it acceptable if the judge had acquiesced to the request with a stipulation that the sperm be withheld from the mother until a full investigation into how the child would be supported was complete?" Article15

Now, if what you mean by 'silver bullet' is that I required your aid, the entirety of the thread doesn't seem to indicate same, as most of the other side ignored your idea.

Judge has every right to gather material that would aid in making an informed decision.

Who cares what the Brisbane judge did?

I would love to see your reaction if we tried to rely on some other country's actions in making a determination about the bush administration's behavior.

Why do you suppose the Brisbane judge ordered the sperm frozen?
 
No, he doesn't. The law prescibes very specific "material" which he has the right to consider, let alone demand, in a case. I realize that in all too many cases these days, judges act as though they're omnipotent, but they really aren't. And I don't know of anything in the law that gives the judge the right in this instance to investigate whether or not a woman is suitable to get pregnant. If you'd like to cite me that particular law, I'd be happy to read it.

I don't care why the Brisbane judge did anything. We aren't in Brisbane, and I don't give a damn what the laws are in other countries.

Yes, you are a coward. You feel very strongly that this woman should not be allowed to bear her dead lover's child. And yet you are afraid to start the ball rolling to prevent it.
 

And this vapid attempt at what in some circles passes for humor is all you have left?

Well, thanks for participating, (300 posts in the thread!) and serving as foil as I revealed the principled side of this argument.

Hopefully, you gals have learned something of intelligent argument, clear thinking, and about the injection of literary references to make posts more interesting.

I hope in some small way I have paved the path to help you make the journey back from the 'darkside.'
 
Not sure why you take my statement as an attempt at humor. I am being totally serious. Perhaps if you tell yourself it was meant as humor you can hide your cowardice from yourself.
 
 
 
 
 
Well, not being privy either to the actual case records or the laws of that state, I can only guess, but I'd say that since the circumstances were so unusual, the medical personnel involved wouldn't perform the procedure without a court ruling.

And no, the judge had no legal standing to "investigate" anything except whether or not there was anyone in the family objecting, or any legal basis for blocking the procedure.
 

Nonsense.

Judge has every right to gather material that would aid in making an informed decision.

Why do you suppose the Brisbane judge ordered the sperm frozen?
 
No, he doesn't. The law prescibes very specific "material" which he has the right to consider, let alone demand, in a case. I realize that in all too many cases these days, judges act as though they're omnipotent, but they really aren't. And I don't know of anything in the law that gives the judge the right in this instance to investigate whether or not a woman is suitable to get pregnant. If you'd like to cite me that particular law, I'd be happy to read it.

I don't care why the Brisbane judge did anything. We aren't in Brisbane, and I don't give a damn what the laws are in other countries.
 

Well, let's see what you do give a damn about.

To be clear, this thread is not about the law, it is about the essence of motherhood.

To be on one side of this debate, or the other, you decide whether or not you agree with this quote:
"To be a mother, you and another adult, committed partner (i.e. spouse) have the interest, intent, ability, and means to make the necessary sacrifices of time, attention, and resources to give the child the nurturing, security, support, love and education he or she needs!
Procreation has little to do with your needs; it has everything to do with the child's needs."

If you do not agree, then I see you as belonging to the majority of those writing on this thread, the "motherhood is all about me," mentality.

If I stand alone, so be it.
 
 
 
My concern is that a child did not have to be born into what is a less than ideal situation.

 
Then no children need be born. Let them all go straight to heaven.

There is no substance to your posts, just some feeble attempt at some kind of attack

Your kind of post is what gives women the appearance of being shallow.

If no one raises an objection the woman will impregnate herself with the harvested sperm. Why are you not actively seeking to file an objection?

Poly, I love reading your posts but I cringed when when I saw the word "gal". I'm shocked that use of that irritating word has spread as far east as Brooklyn. Please don't use it again. Thank you.
 
I guess I see humor where others don't.

After all of the offensive language used on this thread, none by me, you feel the need to criticize my use of 'gals'????

Now, that's funny.
 
 
Poly, do you think all adults have always been adults? Do you think children will always be children? Everyone, if they are fortunate enough will be both. This adults must prostrate themselves before children thing is crazy.
Some children are also mothers. Do you expect total sacrifice from them too? How do you reconcile that?

These inane comments are, I guess, your equivalent of running after the big kids yelling "wait for me, wait for me."

Pathetic.

It's a spectrum, like a rainbow. You choose where you wish to stand.

Some give more, some less. Some children need more, some less.

You can see where I stand. Not prostrate. Stand.

Not to mention the question of WHAT grounds the judge could have ever disallowed the request of the man's family? HOW does them being married or not, in THIS situation change anything for the potential child? Either way, the father is DEAD.

PC why do you keep distancing yourself from the thesis of your OP and imagining yourself as some sort of super hero???

 
... situation without a father and thus increasing substantially the chances that he/she would be at some point be involved with the penitentiary system.

"Various studies come up with slightly different numbers, but all the figures are grim. According to the Index of Leading Cultural Indicators, children from single-parent families account for 63 percent of all youth suicides, 70 percent of all teenage pregancies, 71 percent of all adolescent chemical/substance abuse, 80 percent of all prison inmates, and 90 percent of all homeless and runaway children." Ann Coulter, Guilty p 37-38.

Not to mention who will be financially responsible for these children born out of wedlock? It is no big accomplishment to give birth to young, even animals can do that. The challenge is too raise them in the best way possible and that includes having a mother and a father. Why do people refuse to see into the future of the children of singleparent homes? You give children a fighting chance when you bring them up in intact families.

The counterculture won on this one. Sad. Sad, indeed.

She's a coward. A moral coward. She'll sit on her tush and berate single mothers but she won't work toward getting a law in place that would prevent this woman from impregnating herself.

I don't know, I just think it's delusional to think you know better than the judge in this case. She's obviously projecting all sorts of peripheral baggage into this one situation as if anyone is arguing that having two parents isn't an ideal situation?

The judge simply had no reason to deny the family's request, but she is OUTRAGED?  

One too many mentions of post numbers and super heroes.  
 
 
MAYBE I am missing your point of true concern PC, but if i understand your position correctly, that you do not think this woman should be able to impregnate herself with her dead boyfriend's sperm and you think she should have been tested by OUR GOVERNMENT as to her ability to care for her future child....

Then you would ALSO have to support the government means or otherwise tests for any female that was going to plan a pregnancy...including lesbian women, including any single woman planning in vitro or doing the ''naughty'' to get pregnant, and including any woman that was married, because she too could be in bad straights....

And I just don't think you have thought your outrage through to fruition.

YOU can not single out this one woman without singling out ALL WOMEN and their GOD GIVEN or creator given right, to reproduce, without government approval....that sounds like communist China to me....not something ANYONE from the free world should or would accept, imo.

WHY are you insisting that the government knows best, and should decide when you or I or anyone should or should not, have an offspring?

THIS position of yours is so OFF THE WALL, and the farthest thing from what one would call Conservatism, in my opinion....

Soooooo, what is it....in your personal life, that is making you so irrational imo, on this subject?

Nice post, as usual.

I think some people are pro-choice, some people are anti-abortion and some people, like PC, are anti-choice. In other words, they want to take the choice of having children or not having children out of the hands of individual women and into the hands of the law.

And that is a sad position to be in, imo.
 
 
 
 
I think I should be able to rent a female convict, force her to be impregnated with the sperm of the dead man of my choosing, and then have her baby delivered c-section (hey, it's just a fetus, so no harm no foul) and brought to me in my home.
 
This is one of the dumbest posts I've ever read.

Thank you for giving the board further insight to exactly how retarded you actually are.

I meant to say on my post, something you just mentioned...

I am not certain PC has thought this thru regarding enforcement either....if we measure women's means and capabilities as to whether they should be allowed to have a child or not, does the government then FORCE pregnant women to abort their child to be if they don't meet the government's requirements, like it is in communist China?

She's just not thinking this thru, as i previously said!
