Friends

Here is a sad news that I wanted to share. The tragedy is beyond
words. Our beloved  novelist Allam Rajaiah's only son Kiran Kumar
Allam and another person Chandrasekhar Kammu were killed on Thursday
late evening in Lousiana State University in their apartment by some
unidentified persons. Both the killed were pursuing their Ph.D in LSU.
A grief stricken Allam Rajaiah is starting from Hyderabad to reach LSU
today.

Allam Kiran was living with his life in an apartment complex in LSU.

May I request  our friends living  close to LSU, particuarly those
living in and around Dallas to kindly step up and provide any kind of
help to the bereaved family.

Regards
Swamy
