Our good friends at Center for Inquiry will yet again put on another event in regards to 9/11 Conspiracies. The lecturer will argue that the buildings were not brought down with explosives, and will respond to the various attempts to show that they were.

 
Starts
Friday, August 21st 2009 at 7:00 pm
Ends
Friday, August 21st 2009 at 9:00 pm

Location: 216 Beverley Street (South of the University of Toronto)

RON CRAIG teaches courses in pyrotechnics and explosives at Ryerson University. He has delivered peer reviewed papers on advanced incendiary/improvised explosive devices at conferences throughout North America. Lecturer to CSI personnel on improvised explosive devices and homemade explosives. Member of the International Association of Bomb Technicians and Investigators, and the International Society of Explosive Engineers. Craig has received advanced training in fire and explosion investigation, firefighting and explosives, and has over 25 years of professional experience using all classes of explosives.

This presentation will evaluate the collapse of the World Trade Center towers from a forensic perspective by conducting a fire and explosion investigation. Craigs presentation is intended to be a dynamic and original approach to determine if explosives were primarily responsible for the collapse of WTC 1 and 2.

$5 admission, $4 for students

Free for CFI members

 
Ron Craig has given similar talks in Waterloo and other places. Blogger Jeffrey Shallit was there and gave the event high praise. Google "9/11 "Truthers" Meet their Waterloo - The Ron Craig Talk " since I can't post links.
 
 
Welcome, Havermayer. Craig calmly ate Richard Gage for lunch on a radio show about a year and a half ago. Should be an interesting talk, and the price is right!

Former FDNY Battalion Chief Arthur Scheuerman makes a lengthy reply there.

I only really show up here when I want to promote a 9-11 Debunking Event :P
 
 
Havermayer,

Will you be attending the event at CFI? I will be meeting Ron downtown before the event, and the last time we went to a 9/11 event there, we met a couple of other forumites as well.

Cheers,
Lash
 
 
I wish I could be there.  
 
 
This would have to be the weekend before my planned trip to T.O.

Sigh. Wear a NWO Kitty shirt in my place, someone.
 
 
You are going to visit Terrell Owens?

(What the heck is T.O.?)

This is why I made sure to post this there! :P

I'll probably be there. I'm helping to promote it. If you guys can think of any way to promote it, share it here. Contacting the conspiracy promoting groups is my #1 priority.

I'll probably post the poster that we're going to use here so that if anyone wants to, they can put some up.

Toronto, Ontario perhaps?

It can't be, that would make too much sense.

Yeah, you're right, as usual. I apologize.
 
 
Trawna to the locals; centre of the universe© to the rest of envious Canadians

Hey, that's a great idea. I'll do it!  

 
(What the heck is T.O.?)

 
Hee hee. T.O. is just a local short form for Toronto, Ontario... yeah, we make sense like that.  

 
I'll probably be there. I'm helping to promote it.

 
Were you one of the moderators or participants at the event last year, which was a debate with "truth"er Doug Plumb? If so, I might have met you then, without cluing in to your ID here.

Good idea. I have the July/August newsletter but I haven't seen the poster.
 
 
 
Trawna to the locals

 

Indeed, only Canadians can make Toronto rhyme with Donna.

If Alan Thicke's not there, I'm not interested.

Yeah, it was me (Will) and John vs. Doug. I was pretty bad. I didn't even preprare notes, and was more of just John's plucky side-kick.

The CFI people haven't gotten back to me yet about their poster, so I'm just going to throw one together and post it here.

 

Does anyone else have any ideas for promotion?
 
 
That was a throwback. Thanks Lash! Wanna follow up with a little Gowan?   /derail
 
 
Just out of curiosity, Is there still enough interest in the subject "north of the border" to make this event worth while? Here in the northeast US (Boston to be exact) "truthism" died a couple of years ago (and no one hear noticed, they were here to begin with).

I attended their 2006 Sept. 11th "Day of Action" for their 9-11 Meetup group. It was pretty sad. No more than 15 people. My take is that they've been whittled down to just the hardcore conspiracists and true believers.
 
 
I'll try to keep this on the front page until next week.

"Box Boy" Gage will be in North Hampton in October. I am thinking on attending.
 
 
Bumping. Only a few days away.
 
 
Is anyone going to video this? I'd happily host it, if the quality was okay & CFI/ Ron Craig gave permission.

Let me know when it gets a little closer, I might need a good laugh, (I wonder if he'll remember me from our email conversation a year or so ago)

You wouldn't be lieve the number of troofers I encounter down here in Windsor!
 
 
I sent an invite to the event on the 911 Truth meetup listserv. Looks like I hit a nerve with some of these responses:

 
Yo Bill,

Why don't you get this ****-pump, excuse me, Ron Craig, to directly refute the unexploded nano-thermite paper?

<link removed>

Seriously, time is short, cut to the chase, refute the paper.

Otherwise, as we use to say in the military, shut er' down ****-pump.

Why doesn't Ron just post his debunk of the paper on his website?

Otherwise, sit down and shut the f_ck up.

Kindly yours,

Matthew in Ottawa

 
Message 2:

 
Is this the same gang at Beverley that had the debate with Doug Plumb on what caused the 911 destruction? He won the debate -- they lost. They assumed he was going to make a lot of false claims. He did not.

Doug Plumb is a member of the 600 member Architects & Engineers for 911 Truth.

So, debate is not something being asked for here. Just a presentation with no capability to refute so quickly.

We know the 911 Towers were knocked down including the 3rd tower in order to create martial law in the U.S. whose legislation was written prior to 911. The other reason was to destroy Israel's enemies like Iraq which was innocent of 911 connection.

That's where the 911 debate should be located -- we know the Towers were pulverized -- into powder -- not something caused by fire in 15 minutes!! What a joke!

Heh, typical.

"Internet warriors" who are unwilling to do anything but babble incessantly online, but god/dog forbid that they ever actually put their money where their mouths are.

First example is a clear example of an "internet tough guy".

sigh.
 
 
SteveAustin's group is presenting Loose Change 4, Electric Boogaloo on September 11 in Ottawa. Maybe some of them would be interested in this presentation.

Update - they deleted my comment on their notice referencing this event, so I guess that they are not interested after all.

That is so weak of the TM. I would love to show up at a Truther presentation in order to ask questions and to argue with the people there.

I wonder how they justified taking your comment down.
