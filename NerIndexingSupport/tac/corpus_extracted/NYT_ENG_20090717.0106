America these days gets its televised science fiction in a
narrow spectrum, from serious to grim. (Hello, "Battlestar
Galactica.") Even relatively lighthearted fare like the
"Stargate" franchise strives for a certain level of surface
plausibility.

Which may explain why the British series "Torchwood," which
begins its third season -- actually a five-night mini-series -- on
Monday on BBC America, has been such a success with American
audiences and critics. Maybe we have a hankering for aliens who
appear to be wearing our old Halloween costumes and for stories of
such giggly impossibility that we'd be embarrassed to watch if we
had a second to stop to think.

Actually, the mini-series, "Torchwood: Children of Earth,"
reflects an alarming trend on the part of the BBC to spend more
money on its goofy sci-fi. The monster in this case is a reptilian,
vomit- and blood-spewing thing in a glass tank that's more
reminiscent of "Alien" than of the dime-store concoctions on
"Doctor Who," the show from which "Torchwood" was
anagrammatically spun off. As the title implies, he has evil
designs on the human race's younger members, and he demonstrates
his power early on by having them all stop in their tracks and
chant in unison in scenes that pay tribute to the British
science-fiction classic "Village of the Damned."

Russell T Davies, the Welsh writer and producer who revived
"Doctor Who" and created "Torchwood," has thrived by taking the
low-rent, knockabout style of the original "Doctor Who" and
giving it a nighttime-soap-opera gloss.

This has meant, for one thing, employing much better-looking
actors, like David Tennant, the current (though soon to be
replaced) Doctor, and John Barrowman, Eve Myles and Gareth
David-Lloyd, the principals of "Torchwood."

It has also meant amping up the sexual tension and pushing
against some of the same boundaries Davies did in his breakout
show, "Queer as Folk." On "Torchwood" Capt. Jack Harkness
(Barrowman) and his aide-de-camp, Ianto Jones (David-Lloyd), are
now a full-fledged, kiss-on-the-lips couple.

Davies' greatest inspiration was probably the wedding of
science-fiction adventure and police procedural. Every week or two
the Torchwood team sets out to identify and defeat a new alien,
then returns home to lick its wounds and count its losses.

One problem with "Children of Earth" is that it has to stretch
this process over five hours. This means, inevitably, less
derring-do and more fretting over things like (minor spoiler alert)
the pregnancy of Gwen (Myles) and the future of Jack and Ianto.

Davies has added some structure by concocting a conspiratorial
back story and a running theme of government duplicity; it serves
to stretch out the suspense but it also gives too much screen time
to transient characters we don't care about.

Another way that Davies ekes out the story (major spoiler alert)
is through one of his favorite devices: killing off significant
characters. In the show's first two seasons the Torchwood team lost
three of six members.

The ranks will be thinned again before "Children of Earth" is
over, a development that sent British fans into a tizzy when the
mini-series was shown there two weeks ago. It's as if Davies were
playing a game of chicken with the BBC, which has yet to announce
whether the show will be picked up for a fourth season.

But despite these quibbles, "Children of Earth" is still good
fun, if not good, exactly.

"Torchwood" has always been about jokey repartee and
Saturday-matinee save-the-world heroics, and those are here, along
with other constants, like clumsily staged action and middling
performances. Barrowman and Myles are funny, likable and great to
look at, but that's about as far as it goes.

The fact that the American entertainment press has treated the
mini-series like one of the high points of the summer television
season probably says more about the heaviness and-or drabness of
the season's alternatives -- "Dark Blue," "Nurse Jackie,"
"HawthoRNe," "Warehouse 13" -- than about "Children of Earth"
itself.
