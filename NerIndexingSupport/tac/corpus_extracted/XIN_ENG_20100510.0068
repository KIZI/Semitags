KUWAIT CITY, May 9 (Xinhua)-- Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) plans to inject five to
seven billion dinar (17.5 to 24.5 bln U.S. dollars) into oil and gas facilities
in the next five years, Chairman Sami Al-Rushaid said Monday.

Al-Rushaid said the money would go to the development of pipelines, well
drilling, pumping stations and the acquisition of tug-boats.

He also said the state oil giant would give the private sector more share in the
energy industry as the sector's contributions to the national economy have
increased in the past fiscal year.

KOC was established in 1934 and taken over by the government in 1975. It remains
a subsidiary of the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC), an umbrella entity for
the Gulf Arab emirate's oil industry, and focuses on the exploration and
production of oil and gas.

Kuwait is the fourth-largest exporter of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) and boasts around 10 percent of the world's proven oil
reserves.

The emirate's oil output capacity stands at 3.1 million barrels per day and
pumps out around 2.3 million barrels per day under OPEC's quota.

Kuwait has the ambition to lift its oil output to four million barrels per day
by 2020 and gas production to one billion cubic feet per day by 2016.
