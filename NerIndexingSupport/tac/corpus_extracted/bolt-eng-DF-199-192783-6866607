If by definition democracy is the rule of the people, was the American President, George W. Bush, democratically elected on his first presidential win?
 
 
The US is NOT a Democracy. Therefore, your thesis is in error.

The US is a Constitutional Republic. According to the Constitution, GW was elected peruant to the Constitution in 2000.
 
 
Now we dig this old topic up again? Of course he was elected the first time, he was elected according to the laws of our country as per how elections are handled.

The reason the United States is not a Democracy, but rather a Republic is that our forefathers knew the problems that a 'True Democracy' can have.

Or, to quote Mr. Tommy Lee Jones from the film Men in Black :

A person is smart; people are dumb panicky dangerous animals and you know it.

We have to give kudos to the Founding Fathers in planning the system to prevent the panicky animals from stampeding.
 
 
 
The reason the United States is not a Democracy, but rather a Republic is that our forefathers knew the problems that a 'True Democracy' can have.

 

Our founding fathers were wrong! A true democracy is better. Gore was Democratically elected and would have been president if we were a democracy. You honestly think it's better to have a president that was appointed by judges that ignored the will of the people?

Russia is now more democratic that us! It's time to get rid of the outdated electorial college.

And how can we be fighting for Democracy around the world if we aren't even one. If we're fighting for it than our government obviously knows that it's a better format.

We will never become a true democracy because the government would loose it's grip over it's people. The people would actually be in charge and the corrupt warmongers in Washington can't handle that. Just like red china, we're no better.

Did you consider Clinton a warmonger? He had the US military involved in at least 4 different actions during his years as president. Was he warmongering?

I'm looking for consistency here.
 
 
It would have been a lot better if Clinton refrained from any military action. His actions are far less severe than what Bush has done. And Clinton is generally liked by the international community where as Bush is viewed as a Hitler.

And for once I'd like to have a discussion with a Republican without having the conversation turned on Clinton. Is that at all possible? OK, Get it all out... Let's talk about Monica Lewinski next. Don't forget to mention that he was a draft dodger! Oh, and don't forget that he smoked pot but never inhaled. Let's cover all of the Clinton basis so that we can get on with the real issues on the guy who is acually the President right now!!!
 
 
I'm looking for some consistency here. I only mention Clinton when people start complaining about Bush when Clinton did some of the same things.
 
 
The only consistency is Baldimo changing the subject every time the word Bush is mentioned on every thread he visits.

The election conducted was according to the Constitution as it is written, not as it might have been. In the actual version, we have an electoral college. In the end, the Supreme Court ruled according to law. If you disagree with their decision, quote the portion of their logic that you find fault with and point out why it is a false interpretation.

All of Bush's judicial nominations would also go through if this were a true democracy.

gets paid for every time he types "clinton", i guess.

 
 
 
Will of the people, will o' the wisp. Have you noticed how often the abolition of the Electoral College is discussed and how often action is taken to dismantle it?
 
 
I for one, hope that it is not ever dismantled. The Senate and the electoral college assure that the nation is not continuously dominated by the urban centers of the right and left coasts.
 
 
 
Of course he was elected the first time, he was elected according to the laws of our country as per how elections are handled.
 

If this is the case, if the 2000 selection by the Supremes of Bush as our President was based on the Constitution why did they SPECIFICALLY state that their decision was for this one particulr election only and was not to ever be used as precedent?
 
 
 
All of Bush's judicial nominations would also go through if this were a true democracy.
 

If this were a true democracy, Bush wouldn't have won his first term and congress would have been approving Gore's nominations because Gore would likely be on his second term.

Are you afraid to answer the question? The thread didn't start out about Bush, someone made it that way. I was asking a question that I guess you are all afraid to answer.

I thought it got answered. You just won't accept the answer. The military actions by Bush and Clinton are miles apart. What Bush has done has cost a lot more lives and it was based on a lie. Clinton didn't lie to get his war. There are huge differences!

How many mass graves did they find in Bosnia? Didn't we go to war because of mass killings of Muslims? Didn't that turn out to be false? You claim Bush lied well so did Clinton.

The only reason you care now is because you don't like Bush. I am trying to expose the hypocrisy of the left.

what is your source that clinton lied about bosnia ?

according to all i've read or heard, no american soldiers killed in hostile fire in bosnia. most notably it was attested to by general clark, the nato commander.

btw, it was george h.w. bush that sent troops to somalia. dec. 1992, remember ? i believe we've gone over this before.

the aspirin factory ? more than bush did in the 1st 9 months of his term to find obl. funny, you don't seem to hold the same disdain for the current admin's foul up in bombing the restaurant where saddam was supposed to be the day or so before gulf II started. innocent people killed there as well.

why is that ?

wanna talk about lies ? surely you've seen the footage of powell and rice both saying that there was no indication that iraq had nukes.

as far as bush's 1st election. popular vote, he lost. electoral vote, he won. if you believe that there was no hanky panky going on. i believe that there was. but i don't give a $hit at this point.

i'd rather spend my time focusing on making sure that none of the nimrods currently leading the gop wind up there in 2008.

you must have noticed by now that the last thing in the world i'm afraid of is answering anybody's question on a2k. least of all yours.

also, the thread did start out about bush. here's the original post to the thread:

 
If by definition democracy is the rule of the people, was the American President, George W. Bush, democratically elected on his first presidential win?
 

but none of this explains why you start going off about clinton in just about every thread.

it's history. get over it and move on.
 
 
 
How many mass graves did they find in Bosnia? Didn't we go to war because of mass killings of Muslims? Didn't that turn out to be false? You claim Bush lied well so did Clinton.

What would it prove to find mass graves in Bosnia? Milosevic was guilty of war crimes and convicted. Even so, I said it would be better if Clinton hadn't gotten us into those wars, so where does that make me a hypocrite? There's also a big difference in the wars that Bush has gotten us into vs Clintons wars. Major differences in the way they were planned and carried out.

I for one think we were justified in going into Afghanistan because they had Bin Laden. But Bush failed us by giving up on Bin Laden. So I have reason to hate Bush because his lies cost many lives and don't look out for the best interest of my country.
 
 
Clinton did not start the war in Bosnia but Bush did in Iraq....and the corelation is?
 
 
Nicely put, RR, couldn't be clearer than that...
 
 
 
...So I have reason to hate Bush because his lies cost many lives and don't look out for the best interest of my country.
 

And the lie is? Bush is continuously accused of being a liar on the basis of things that are not lies, e.g. being wrong.
 
 
Is it hard to breathe with your head in the sand?

He took a gamble and said there are weapons of mass destruction hoping that he would find them and be proven rite. There were none so he lied! He wasn't wrong, he lied! But this can be debated forever. He will never have to own up to his lie with a majority Republican congress.

This is stupid that I'm even taking the time to argue this with you. Your brain is already programmed by the Bush propaganda that his administration pays to have run on TV news disguised as real news stories.

He looked at the history and the intelligence, and believed what many, many did, including Bill Clinton, that Hussein still retained his former WMD, and WMD development programs. Hussein had, after all, not proven that they were destroyed, which should have been trivially easy. This is not what the word lie means. This is a belief that ulimatedly turns out to be incorrect.

Furthermore, when did Hussein destroy these weapons? Was it many years ago, or a week before invasion? Do you know? Are you absolutely positive they are destroyed and not moved? Do you have evidence? In fact, while there are theories, no one quite knows how Hussein made the transition from having WMD to not having them.

Of course, like most of the liberals here, you wish to articulate your views and not have them challenged, while the rest of us are debating.

Ah Brandon, you do me too much honor--i would never presume to answer for you, it's not my place.

It's a Ceili sighting... hoorah ! ! !

Details, details... don't confuse the conservatives, Boss, they have a hard enough time as it is.
 
 
Brannon9000,

Inspectors told him for months that there were no weapons. Bush chose to ignore the people who were actually there. Plus, we can see every square inch of Iraqi terrain by satellite. If there were weapons being moved it would have been seen. If bush had seen footage of the weapons from satellite than he wouldn'ta have to later admit that there were no weapons. They would have found them and he would have been proven rite. But they never saw the weapons, they made the whole thing up!

The most important thing a president can ever do is take a country to war. And even if he honestly believed there were weapons he turned out to be "Wrong". It was a careless grave mistake that cost hundreds of thousands of lives. He needs to face the music for that.

The truth is that he wasn't sure that there were weapons. But he sold the war to the American people insisting that there were weapons. THAT'S A LIE!!!

He should have said there may be weapons But if he hadn't have come across as being so sure, he wouldn't have gotten his war. This war was his whole reason for running for president after all. That's why he has no other agenda. Social Security was an idea that he came up with later so that he would look busy, otherwise he would have pushed for it in his first term. People that know him have come out and said that Bush had plans to invade Iraq even before 9/11.

There's another flaw of this president. He had the plans for invasion, but he never had an exit strategy. His top priority was to get Saddam and worry about the consequences later. Well now he has to pay the piper.

And what ever happened to the whole thing about Iraqi oil being used to pay for the war?

I wont be able to continue debating this until Thursday because I wont be near a computer. So you can't accuse me of dropping the debate until then.
