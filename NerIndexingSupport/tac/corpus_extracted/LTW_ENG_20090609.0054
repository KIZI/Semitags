The Supreme Court ruled Monday that elected judges must recuse
themselves in "extreme" cases where huge campaign contributions create the
perception that they will be biased in favor of their campaign
benefactors.

A five-member majority of the court decided a West Virginia Supreme
Court justice erred in participating in a case overturning a $50 million
verdict against a company headed by a man who spent $3 million on the
justice's election.

The court on Monday said the perception of bias was so great that it
violated the constitutional rights of the man who brought the
suit.

"Not every campaign contribution by a litigant of attorney creates a
probability of bias that requires a judge's recusal, but this is an
exceptional case," wrote Justice Anthony Kennedy.

The case -- the plot of a John Grisham novel -- has drawn a spotlight on
the skyrocketing costs of judicial elections, especially state Supreme Court
races. Justice at Stake, a judicial reform group, notes that state Supreme
Court candidates -- 39 states elect judges -- raised almost $168 million
from 2000 to 2007, nearly double the amount raised during the
1990s.

Among the most prominent critics of the campaign spending is former
justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who was in the packed courtroom during oral
arguments in the case in March.

Monday's decision reinforced the pivotal role of Kennedy, who often is
in position to decide controversial cases that divide the court
ideologically. In this case, he sided with the court's liberal wing:
Justices John Paul Stevens, David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen
Breyer.

Kennedy diminished the impact of the decision, saying that state codes
of judicial conduct already provide judges with guidelines on recusal, and
that "most disputes over disqualification will be resolved without resort to
the Constitution."

But the dissenting conservative justices said the decision will cause a
flood of lawsuits by the losing litigants in a case, and do "far more to
erode public confidence in judicial impartiality than an isolated failure to
recuse in a particular case," in the words of Chief Justice John
Roberts.

He criticized the "inherently boundless nature" of the court's decision,
and the list of 40 questions he said the decision did not answer stretched
for seven pages of his dissent.

"Today's opinion requires state and federal judges simultaneously to act
as political scientists (why did candidate X win the election?), economists
(was the financial support disproportionate?) and psychologists (is there
likely to be a debt of gratitude?)," Roberts wrote. He was joined by
Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito.

The case was brought by Hugh Caperton, the owner of a small coal company
who convinced a jury that the business tactics of A.T. Massey Coal and its
chief executive, Don Blankenship, drove Caperton's company into bankruptcy.
The jury awarded $50 million.

In the next statewide election, Blankenship spent $3 million to oppose a
state Supreme Court justice he disliked, and to elect newcomer Brent
Benjamin. When Massey's appeal of the award came to the high court, Benjamin
refused to recuse himself, and twice cast the decisive vote in 3 to 2
decisions overturning the verdict.

Caperton asked the court to send the case back to the West Virginia high
court for a hearing without Benjamin. The award at stake is now worth more
than $80 million because of interest.

The majority agreed with Caperton. "Just as no man is allowed to be a
judge in his own case, similar fears of bias can arise when -- without the
consent of the other parties -- a man chooses the judge in his own cause,"
Kennedy wrote. "And applying this principle to the judicial election
process, there was here a serious, objective risk of actual bias that
required Justice Benjamin's recusal."

The majority did not question Benjamin's own findings of his
impartiality or determine whether he fostered actual bias, saying that was
not necessary.
