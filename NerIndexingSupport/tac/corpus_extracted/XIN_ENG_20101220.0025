Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Monday that any ruling by the
U.S.-sponsored Special Tribunal for Lebanon (STL) is "null and void," the local
English language satellite Press TV reported.

"This court is a kangaroo court and every verdict it issues is rejected. We hope
influential sides in Lebanon will act prudently, so the issue will not be turned
into a problem," Khamenei made the remarks in a meeting with visiting Qatari
Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani.

The establishment of Special Tribunal for Lebanon is a negotiated agreement
between the United Nations and the Lebanese Republic to try those behind and
responsible for the attack of Feb. 14, 2005 in Beirut that killed former
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri and 22 others.
