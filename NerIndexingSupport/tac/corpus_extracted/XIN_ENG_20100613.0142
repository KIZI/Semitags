Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping will arrive in Dhaka Monday, starting his
visit to the People's Republic of Bangladesh.

The following are some basic facts about Bangladesh:

Located on the subcontinent of South Asia, Bangladesh borders India and Myanmar.
It covers a total area of 147,570 square kilometers, with Dhaka as its capital.

Among its population of 147 million, 98 percent are Bengalis and more than 88
percent are Muslims. The national language of Bangladesh is Bengali, while
English serves as the official language.

Bangladesh is a confluence of three main rivers -- the Ganges, the Brahmaputra
and the Meghna rivers. The country is dotted with more than 700 lakes and
rivers.

Bangladesh is one of the world's poorest nations. In recent years, the
government has adopted many policies to improve its economy. And its gross
domestic product (GDP) has been steadily growing year on year.

However, according to the country's National Bureau of Statistics, the GDP
growth dropped to 5.54 percent between July 2009 and June 2010 due to the
effects of the global economic crisis.

China and Bangladesh established diplomatic ties on Oct. 4, 1975. Since then,
bilateral relations have been developing smoothly with pragmatic cooperation in
various fields. In 2009, trade volume between the two countries stood at 4.58
billion U.S. dollars.
