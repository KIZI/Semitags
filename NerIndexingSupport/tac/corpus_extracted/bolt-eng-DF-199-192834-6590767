For the next month people will gather around the water cooler on Monday's talking about the NFL (that's the National Football League) playoffs leading up to the Super Bowl in Dallas on February 6th. Perhaps you know something about football. Or it is possible you will stand there with a frozen grin on your face, unable to say anything remotely intelligent.
WE CAN HELP YOU!
Several of us A2K'ers have created a support group to painlessly guide you towards appearing knowledgeable even if, like many of us, you are clueless.
This weekend (Jan 8th and 9th) there will be 4 games. They are called the Wildcard games.
What you need to do is post your picks here. Darts or flipping coins works. This is kind of a practice week. After that, a schedule will be posted for the rest of the playoffs. You will need to invest a grand total of 7 minutes. Total. Max.
Please indicate, by noon on Saturday, Jan 8th, your picks on these 4 games:
NY Jets @ Indianapolis Colts
Baltimore Ravens @ Kansas City Chiefs
New Orleans Saints @ Seattle Seahawks
Green Bay Packers @ Philadelphia Eagles
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Ok, signing in.

Bolded teams = winners.

NY Jets @ Indianapolis Colts
Baltimore Ravens @ Kansas City Chiefs
New Orleans Saints @ Seattle Seahawks
Green Bay Packers @ Philadelphia Eagles
 
 
@tsarstepan,

The Jets aggravated me no end in Fantasy Football (Sanchez was my quarterback), so this seems to me a perfectly good reason to pick the Colts, who also aggravated me, but not as much.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Indy
Baltimore
New Orleans
Philadelphia
 
 
@ossobuco,

I'm placing my faith that the Jet's defense will kick in one more time. Plus I like it that no one else seems to have faith in the Jets.

Besides this wild card round is just fodder for the real games when the Patriots start playing and ultimately take the whole burrito, (enchiladas aren't classy enough for Tom Brady and the gang).
 
 
NY Jets @ Indianapolis Colts
Baltimore Ravens @ Kansas City Chiefs
New Orleans Saints @ Seattle Seahawks

Why are we stopping at week one? Warning: Spoiler Alert! Stop reading now if you don't want to know how each game will end.

Week 2
The Steelers beat the Colts
The Pats beat the Ravens
The Saints beat the Bears
And the Falcons best the Packers

Week 3
The Pats beat the Steelers
And the Saints beat the Falcons

And of course The Patriots win the Superbowl.

(The only one I am not certain about is the Saints beating the Falcons.)
 
 
Jets
Ravens
Packers
Seahawks
 
 
Coin Toss/Coin Toss joined us mid-season on the year long A2K NFL "Pick-Um" thread. CT was deliberately kept gender-less. No particular reason other than that I found it somewhat challenging to do that in writing my weekly narratives. I doubt that the folks involved in that thread noticed that quirk, which turned out to be more difficult than it seems.
The idea came about when the suggestion was made that we, as a group, could do just as well by making our picks by flipping coins. It was argued that our results could be shown to not be statistically much better than CT/CT's which would seem to be 50/50.
For the season, we as a group made 6,231 picks. We were correct in 60.7% of them.
This week, CT/CT goes for: Indy, Balt, NO and G Bay. CT is happy with the picks.
CT/CT, by the way, had Seattle over St Louis yesterday.

@OmSigDAVID,

  You're a braver man than I, David. You realize, of course, that this won't make you popular with the other members, don't you?  
 
 
Instead of a coin toss - and because I know absolutely nothing about football- I'm going to do it by which city I know/like better and see how well I do. So my picks will be:

New York
Baltimore
New Orleans
Philadelphia

Just as an experiment to begin with, but I am fairly competititive in spirit, so if one of my teams makes it to the Super Bowl - I'll watch it instead of the Andy Griffith show marathon and eat me some chicken wings and drink a beer or two.
Sounds fun to me...can't hurt. Is there a prize?
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Indianapolis
Baltimore

@realjohnboy,

David, as is apparent from the "thumbs down" we've received, they don't like us! I don't think I'll ever recover from this crushing rebuff.    
 
 
I certainly didn't thumb down your or David's posts, Bill (may I call you Bill?).
I have read through your posts. I can't quite comprehend what seems to be animosity towards sports or phys ed for kids in school. You have a thread related to those issues. Please link it and we might join you there.
I shouldn't hold my breath, I suspect, waiting for your picks.

(From what I gather, you have to pick teams every week right through the Super Bowl. Remember to come back next week and pick four more.)

Really? I think that this season has shown that these teams are clearly superior to their opponents in this round of the playoffs, on the average.

@Oylok,

I don't think so, Oylok. This week is something of a practice one. If I am correct, after this, we have to - or get to - pick all the way through the Super Bowl.

Yes, this week is a warm-up because there are too many variables in who plays whom next week. It would be mind-numbing to try to explain the permutations.

@realjohnboy,

Hi.   Thanks for being civil.

 
I certainly didn't thumb down your or David's posts, Bill (may I call you Bill?).
 

You may call me Bill. I wasn't saying that you in particular thumbed down our posts. Of course, we did offend someone because we had "0" instead of the norm (which is "1"). But I wasn't personally offended by receiving a "0." I was just trying to have a little fun, just as David has said he was. The thought never crossed my mind to post in this thread until I saw that David had done so. As we've corresponded frequently by PM, I've considered David to be a friend. Some may disagree with his political views (As for me, I gave up on politics years ago), but he's one of the most polite members of this forum (as is edgarblythe, by the way, with whom I've also corresponded by PM a number of times)). My intention was simply to provide David with a little moral support. I'm dismayed and saddened by the disruption I seem to have caused.   I guess some could argue that David was being perhaps a little rude, but I should point out that neither of us in this instance resorted to name-calling (e.g., this from a sports fan in another thread, "you... pathetic f---ing loser(s)") or personally attacking someone who had simply made an innocuous statement. I had not intended to post any more comments in this forum about the sports culture or mandatory P.E. When I posted last, I assumed that nothing would come of my and David's posts. If I had known that I would have caused this reaction, I never would have posted here. Oh, well, you live and learn (again).    

 
I have read through your posts. I can't quite comprehend what seems to be animosity towards sports or phys ed for kids in school. You have a thread related to those issues. Please link it and we might join you there.
 

I've posted too much. I wonder how much you've read. Sometimes I am short-tempered, I guess.  

There is a sense in which I'm not "anti-sports." If I had a teenage son who wanted to play football in high school, I would support him (with reservations). And I'm certainly not sedentary. I'm a confirmed gym rat (bodybuilding). I wouldn't dream of taking sports out of schools for those who want to play them. I'm not against phys ed. I favor the reform of mandatory P.E. The traditional sports-based approach (which even some "progressive" members of this forum support) shortchanges nonathletic students. The most hostile place for a nonathletic boy is a mandatory sports-based P.E. class. I'm convinced that historically more bullying has taken place in mandatory sports-based boys' P.E. (which, again, is supported by some "progressive" members of this forum, despite the bullying, which is dismissed as "part of life") than in all the academic classes combined.

Although you're clearly a gentleman, I regret that I must decline your offer to link the thread to which you refer. The hostile reaction that Chumley's two posts "I hate sports" and "Welcome, Sports Haters!" received indicates that no civil exchange is possible. I would be besieged with ad hominem attacks from members who believe that the sports culture (mind you, the culture associated only with several extremely popular sports) is sacrosanct and therefore above any critical evaluation. There's no point in having an exchange with people whose minds are closed. Besides, I had already given up posting in this forum anymore about any aspect of the sports culture or the need to reform mandatory P.E. for the benefit of those students who are the most physically unfit. I should have exercised better judgment and let David have his fun without me.

 
I shouldn't hold my breath, I suspect, waiting for your picks.
 

I'm sorry, my friend. I don't even know how the game is played. I guess the sports bug never bit me. Best wishes (sincerely).   Exit (permanently, at least as far as this thread is concerned), stage left.  
 
 
@wmwcjr,

I didn't thumb down yours, Bill. I thumbed down David's. He interjects on threads routinely when they are just getting interesting in discussion with a kind of gun pulsing, or whatever. Anti sport is a new sideline.

I don't ignore david, generally - he is a civil person I can talk with and he with me, or so it seems.
I'm aware of your organized sports beef. I don't share the whole thing, but understand some of it.

This is a game thread. It's a place where many of us who disagree on all sorts of stuff come together to play with guessing.

Give it a break.
 
 
@wmwcjr,

Bill, we who post here get used to thumbs. Sometimes thumbs are thoughtful, one way or another, and sometimes they are regurgation. Learn to look past them.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Wm has issues re bullying, which bunches of us get. He did go after fbaezer, which made me understand how he didn't understand. All these things are complicated.

I'm glad wm is here.
 
 
I was reading today about the quarterback for Stanford, Andrew Luck. He led his team to a rout in a bowl game over Virginia Tech a day or two ago.
He is listed as a senior next year, but actually has two years of eligibility left. His "dilemma" is whether or not he should leave college now or play another season or two for Stanford.
He is estimated to be able to sign something like a $40M contract over a few years if he turns pro now. If he stays another year, that could drop by half depending on the labor negotiations between the NFL and the players' union where there might be a cap on the salaries of rookies.
Complicating matters is the probable departure of the Stanford head coach (and his staff) and the graduations of several key players.
The Stanford fans are, of course, begging him to stay. The president of Stanford, however, was more pragmatic (humorously so).
One thing that caught my eye is that Andrew Luck is majoring in architecture.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I'm following this. I somewhat want A. Luck to get his degree.
 
 
@ossobuco,

I want all my atheletes from my school (OU for those that don't remember) to return for their Jr and Sr years - those who are eligible for the NFL to leave cause they need to get money!

Actually, I joke - I wish for all to get their education......
 
 
@BillW,

I can only expect Andrew Luck will be a good architect. He has near paralyzing choices.
 
 
@ossobuco,

I suppose being good in the nfl will give you selling pump re architecture, but this fellow seems more interested in the ways of architecture.

I'm wondering how he works all this out.
Hard to be this young and deciding.
 
 
@ossobuco,

 
I didn't thumb down yours, Bill. I thumbed down David's.
 
That 's a perfectly fine thing to do.
U r STILL getting your books from that Portland, Oregon book store next summer.

David
 
 
@ossobuco,

It has also been pointed out that if he is picked 1st - he is in line for a $50+ million signing bonus. That can buy a lot of education and if he doesn't have a good senior year, he may fall completely out of the top 10. Soooooooooooo.........?
 
 
@ossobuco,

 
Wm has issues re bullying, which bunches of us get. He did go after fbaezer,

He is admirable in all respects.

@OmSigDAVID,

I only wish.

(hi, david)
 
 
@BillW,

The guy is good, which ever way he goes.

Me, I'm interested in his arch takes, although being a prince in arch school can be decimating re creativity.
 
 
@BillW,

I think Andrew Luck will and should turn pro. He is smart and physically very talented and his family (his father is an exec at West Virginia University) will probably keep him clear of the leeches who suck dry more naive athletes.
Hopefully they can keep his head screwed on straight.

IMHO, there's almost zero chance the She-hawks will beat the Saints. Pete Caroll is Clueless in Seattle (been waiting to use that line for years.) If I had ANY money that's the only game I'd bet on.
 
 
I wonder how sports fans woud respond
if thay discovered that their preferred athletes favored
something abhorrent, e.g. wife beating, communism, nazism, gun control etc.

BTW, communism was last century's abberant/abhorent behavior. It's almost been eradicated. Not so sure whether or not China is truly a communist nation (now that Hong Kong is theirs) or an indeterminate dictatorship. Cuba will drift over towards the light once the Castros have gone on to the just rewards in hell. No. Korea... damn...?!
 
 
@George,

My bold prediction: She-hawks will only score 7 points and that'll be it for them. And mebbe they'll score those 7 pts in the 2nd half.

This weekend (Jan 8th and 9th) there will be 4 games. They are called the Wildcard games.

Fewer than 48 hours until the kickoff of games on Saturday at noon (ET). 28 players in thus far. I am missing 5 players from the regular season. I hope I can lure them back in and, of course, get new players.

@realjohnboy,

To give my bona fides as a football dumkopf, my very best super bowl sunday was spent with pals at a vietnamese restaurant in LA's chinatown, where we knew the chief cook and bottle washer who was also the owner, and then went to a place in Westchester (near LAX) where one of the guys was in the band. A total debauch. The city was quiet that day. Even still. Good day to go for a drive, except perhaps when the bars closed.

Another one of the guys had an interview the next day for some LA City administration job. The interviewer eyed him up and down and then said, "I saw you at Los --------- last night." He got the job, if I remember right. Whether in spite of his dancing (he was 6' 4" and his vietnamese wife was perhaps 5'-0), or his credentials, I've no idea.

I'm also a long time sport follower, since the day I was at a friend's house and the family was watching the Kentucky Derby. I was twelve. The horse I picked because of his name, Swaps, won. That was it, I started reading sport stories from the library and in the newspaper.

No one would ever call me an athlete, but I got to be passing good at some sports, for minutes at a time.
 
 
@Ragman,

 
ok...I feel the intense urge to go with my guy:
 

Oops, that should have read gut...not guy.
 
 
@ossobuco,

I was never any good at team sports. I played tennis pretty well but I tended to get impatient with volleys and would end up making a stupid play.
Track was fun at first, but running around an oval got boring.
Cross-country running was great. As those of you who have met me know, I am long and lean. I thoroughly enjoyed scampering through the woods on trails up and down hills.
I was in a race one time with guys from a couple of other high schools. I was perhaps in 5th place part way through the run. I came around a bend in the trail and there were the guys ahead of me. Stopped. Crouched.
A bear and its cub were sitting in the middle of the trail 20 yards ahead of us. And they seemed unwilling to go anywhere soon.
We decided to run back to the starting point and determine the winner by who got there first.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Snort!

I admit that what I was good at for minutes at time was tennis, which I attribute to a Slazenger racquet I borrowed - I lost competence when I gave it back (I remember a double date, my date good at tennis (math and music) and me, just beginning, playing doubles. I was overwrought about where to move to on the court), golf, and swimming, which I didn't learn until my later thirties. I was pretty good at batting in softball and a fool re catching the ball.

@Ragman,

The PRC is regarded by several political scientists as one of the last five Communist states (along with Vietnam, North Korea, Laos, and Cuba) but simple characterizations of PRC's political structure since the 1980s are no longer possible. The PRC government has been variously described as communist and socialist, but also as authoritarian, with heavy restrictions remaining in many areas, most notably on the Internet, the press, freedom of assembly, reproductive rights, and freedom of religion.

The country is ruled by the Communist Party of China (CPC), whose power is enshrined in China's constitution.[ The political system is very decentralized with limited democratic processes internal to the party and at local village levels, although these experiments have been marred by corruption. There are other political parties in the PRC, referred to in China as democratic parties, which participate in the People's Political Consultative Conference and the National People's Congress.

Faster then the guy behind you.
 

Two campers were confronted by an obviously angry bear. One camper sat down and quickly ripped off his hiking boots and started putting on his sneakers. The other camper said, "Silly, you can't outrun a bear". As he finished tying his shoes, standing up he exclaimed, "I only have to outrun you!"

Kinda, I was just responding to Ragman, sorry for diversion........ I didn't know why Ragman and David diverted - I just hate a hanging question  
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
NY Jets @ Indianapolis Colts
Baltimore Ravens @ Kansas City Chiefs
New Orleans Saints @ Seattle Seahawks
Green Bay Packers @ Philadelphia Eagles

 

not who I like, but it makes some kinda sense
 
 
@BillW,

Pardon my oversight, Bill. I had a momentary lapse and my commentary belonged on a different thread, too. This clearly is meant to serving more of a sporty non-political audience. And trust me, my comment was clearly not meant to be taken as serious statement about communistic systems, etc.

Is a hanging question anything like a hanging chad?  
 
 
@Ragman,

Point taken from you and Johnny. I am currently undergoing multiple lashes from my wife with wet hosiery filled with cooked macaroni for my digressions.

@spendius,

What is netball? volleyball?

I was introduced to volleyball in an entirely new to me small high school a couple of thousand miles from my last school. No instruction, as everyone else knew the game. It was primarily embarrassing for me.

All these years away, I think the gym teacher was poor at teaching.

I later had a laboratory dishwasher (I've had a few, two of them spectacular in life in later years) who was a dental student crazed for volleyball. She fed herself aspirin. Not good. We yammered at her.

@ossobuco,

I said that I wouldn't come back, but I did to say that you're a nice lady. That lengthy post of mine sure made me look like a nut.   But I did feel bad about disrupting the thread, which was not my intention. 'Nuff said, I guess.  
 
 
@OmSigDAVID,

I was being sarcastic for humorous effect. Oh, well...
 
 
@wmwcjr,

wm, relax. You, despite yourself, are one of us talking here, you are liked. We batter back and forth. We are an accumulation of people of very divergent views - in life and politics - who are playing a guessing game and being inordinantly nice, some of the time. Stay, and talk.

@George,

We're tapping our feet - waiting for playoffs to start. Straightening my collar and getting back to the subject of playoff perfomers and performances.

My bold (and silly) prediction here is QB Vick will be stopped for maybe 3 quarters (if that) by Packers and come zooming back, only to have his hopes dashed by a FG 'miracle' at the end.
 
 
@Ragman,

Oh, and Ravens will do a beat-down on Chiefs by a double-digit margin.
 
 
@ossobuco,

I wasn't "guessing" osso and I have back to back Pick-Um Titles to prove it. With over 250 games guessing would leave us all in close proximity to 0.500. If CoinToss varies by any significant margin from 0.500 there is something fishy about the tossing.
 
 
@spendius,

Good for you, you must be perspicacious in this one area. Even when I have won the week, which is admittedly not often, there has been an element of guessing in at least one or two of my choices.
 
 
@ossobuco,

Anyone who doesn't score 100% every week is guessing. We're all guessing. Anyone who thinks they aren't guessing every time out is delusional. It's just a matter of degrees. For most of us it's just a fun activity. Others seem to act as though it's a serious proof of their worthiness or superiority.
 
 
Perspicacasious?
Congrats to Spendius, by the way, as the English crushed the Aussies to win the month-long Ashes cricket match series.
I got around to looking at the start times for the games this weekend. Times shown are Eastern U.S.
Saturday, January 8th-
4:30 - New Orleans @ Seattle
8:00 - NY Jets @ Indianapolis
Sunday, January 9th-
1:00 - Baltimore @ Kansas City
4:30 - Green Bay @ Philadelphia

I said that picks for all four games were due by 1 pm Saturday. 4:30 is the actual deadline. That leaves anyone who wants to join us about 24 hours.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

4:30 - New Orleans @ Seattle
8:00 - NY Jets @ Indianapolis

1:00 - Baltimore @ Kansas City, although I'm tempted to pick KC
4:30 - Green Bay @ Philadelphia
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Yes, I guessed right!
 http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/perspicacious 

Most of my spelling errors are stupidbeyondbelief typing transposings. For example, I routinely use the word and for an, and hear for here, even though I know better, and have known better not just recently, but for decades. My brain to fingers typing seems to get stuck in a few synapses.
 
 
@ossobuco,

That's not guessing osso. Nowhere near.
 
 
@spendius,

Ok, ok, I'll call it a crapshoot instead.
 
 
We have 30 players in. Of the 24 players who participated in the Pick-Um game during the regular season, I am missing Rhys, Panzade and Alex. I have a note that Engineer posted earlier on here that he might play.
Anyone else is very welcome to join in.
Thus far:
Sat 4:30 - New Orleans @ Seattle. 26 of us are choosing the Saints vs 4 going for the Seahawks.
Sat 8:00 - NY Jets @ Indianapolis. Only 4 think the Jets will win.
Sun 1:00 - Baltimore @ Kansas City. 24-6 is the split in favor of the Ravens.
Sun 4:30 - Green Bay @ Philadelphia. By a much narrower 18-12 margin we are leaning towards the Packers.
There are 8 "experts" on ESPN who I followed as if they had been involved in our regular season game. The best of the lot would have ended in 4th place as I recall while the worst would have been in something like 22nd. One of the 8 has Seattle while 2 are choosing the Jets, Chiefs and Eagles.
11 of us have settled on the weekend combo of Saints, Colts, Ravens and Packers.
A big nod here to Parados who chooses the underdog (as the majority of us see it) in ALL 4 GAMES!
Please join in the fun. See your name in print.
 
 
Have you put any money on any of these NFL games, Spendy?
 
 
@realjohnboy,

FOUR of us picked the Seahawks? Amazing.
 
 
@George,

amazing that anyone picked the 'Hawks?
 
 
@BillW,

Amazing that anyone but yours truly did.
 
 
@spendius,

 
I have back to back Pick-Um Titles

 

you're a good guesser

unless you're suggesting that all games are fixed
 
 
@realjohnboy,

GreenBay  
 
 
@SweetT,

Hi, SweetT:
Please pick in all of the games this weekend.
NY Jets @ Indy - _____
New Orleans @ Seattle - _______
Baltimore @ Kansas City - _______
Green Bay @ Philly - GREEN BAY
 
 
Rhys is in with his picks:
New Orleans
Indy (despite several Jets having connections to his state of Mass)
Kansas City
Green Bay
 
 
@ehBeth,

I'm no better guesser than any other guesser Beth and I don't think all the games are fixed in the sense you mean.
 
 
I was reviewing last year's thread and came across a feature we included that was popular. It allows you to sort of keep score at home.
WILD CARD GAMES:
New Orleans = NO Seattle = SE New York Jets = NY Indianapolis = IN
Baltimore = BA Kansas City = KC Green Bay = GB Philadelphia = PH
There are, I believe, 16 different possible permutations.
IN-BA-NO-GB: Johnboy, Osso, Tico, Region, JPB, Mysteryman, Lmur, CoastalRat, Sozobe, Cowdoc (10 players)
IN-BA-NO-PH: EhBeth, Jespah, Edgar, Spendius, LiontamerX, Miz Cowdoc, Ragman (7)
IN-KC-NO-GB: AndyClubber, Rhys (2)
IN-KC-NO-PH: Cycloteam, Wandeljw, SoupKitchen (3)
IN-BA-SE-GB: George, Oylok (2)
NY-BA-NO-GB: McGentrix, Tsarstephen (2)
NY-KC- NO-GB: BillW (1)
NY-BA-SE-GB: Fbaezer (1)
NY-BA-NO-PH: Aidan (1)
NY-KC-SE-PH: Parados (1)
Any other combination got not no takers.
There is a fair chance that I have made an error here.
 
 
@George,

Hey George, I was amazed with the number of ESPN exoerts picked the 'Hawks. I'd say that you and 3 others are on good upset ground!
 
 
@BillW,

Okay, so I checked the experts and there was only one and 90% of the nation (70,000+ votes) picked the Saints - nevermind! I thought that there were a lot of Boomers group who picked the 'Hawks.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
Times shown are Eastern U.S.
Saturday, January 8th-
4:30 - New Orleans @ Seattle
8:00 - NY Jets @ Indianapolis
Sunday, January 9th-
1:00 - Baltimore @ Kansas City
4:30 - Green Bay @ Philadelphia

 

LAST CALL FOR PICKS!
 
 
Yahoo has a Pick-Um game. Here is the split amongst all of the players in all of the leagues registered there:
New Orleans 95% - Seattle 5%
Baltimore 84% - Kansas City 16%
Indianapolis 77% - NY Jets 23%
Philadelphia 51% - Green Bay 49%
 
 
At the half
24-20
Seahawks leading
 
 
Halftime-
Seattle 24 New Orleans 20
The Saints get to the Seahawks 3 but can't get the TD and have to settle for a FG.
The stats are fairly even.
Seattle pulls off a trick play as a receiver "falls down" as a play starts and his defender assumes he won't get back up. Carlson does get up and catches a short pass for a TD.
 
 
Could you repeat that?
 
 
@George,

 
Could you repeat that?

 

- Can't, no longer true - it is now 20-31, don't remember who is which?
 
 
@BillW,

Oh Johnny, I got a change to make -

oops, 20-34 now!

I would have picked the Saints to loose to any one of the other Wild Card teams. So, I guess you could say that Seattle go a lucky opponent at home.
 
 
Seattle just scored another TD.
This is gonna be a HUUUUUGE upset if Seattle wins this game.
 
 
@mysteryman,

41-36 with 1:30 left as the Saints score. Onside kick?
 
 
Oof
 
 
Hey, I got my change in  

Then there were 4!
 
 
Well, who woulda thunk it? George, Fbaezer, Parados and Oylok had Seattle, along with 1 ESPN expert.
 
 
Entertaining game, I thought.

Jets-Colts is kind of a snoozer so far.

Bruins are leading Canadiens 2-0, looking strong early.
Celtics tied at 30 against the Bulls.

My remote is overheating.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Seahawks won?! No way. That must've been an entertaining game, I missed it.
 
 
@sozobe,

It twas......
 
 
Oh, my! The Jets take out the Colts. McGentrix, Fbaezer, BillW, Tsarstephan, Parados and Aidan saw that as happening.
Fbaezer and Parados are 2-0 thus far.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

batting 1000 here. I had to laugh when I just saw the Jets-ies took out Indy. So glad I didn't wager on who I thought would win these 2,
 
 
@Ragman,

even more mind boggling is the fact that the worst playoff team in NFL history beat the defending SB champs...
 
 
I was rooting for the Jets. Didn't think they'd win, but I was rooting for 'em. Rex Ryan is crazy but I kinda like his style.
 
 
@sozobe,

I root for anyone playing the Jets.

The good news is that now the Patriots get them all to themselves in Foxboro.
 
 
@maxdancona,

 
The good news is that now the Patriots get them all to themselves in Foxboro.
 

 
 
 
We are off and running...or passing. Baltimore @ Kansas City.
It is 25 degrees with a 7 mph breeze.
 
 
The Ravens lead 10-7 and the stats are in their favor at the half.
 
 
@Region Philbis,

 
even more mind boggling is the fact that the worst playoff team in NFL history beat the defending SB champs...
 

I realized this before, but not so distinctly!
 
 
@maxdancona,

 
I root for anyone playing the Jets.

I is quite ironic, but I think the Patriots had a better chance against the Colts and the Jets had no chance against the Colts. I did pick the Jets even though I preferred the Colts - anyone except the New York -
 
 
The nearest equivalent in our football to attacking the punt kicker like that Colts player did is a defender catching the ball in the penalty area, placing the ball on the penalty spot and the goalkeeper turning his back on the penalty taker. In cricket it would be a batter knocking his stumps over with his backlift.
 
 
Baltimore defeats Kansas City. Many of us finally score a point*.

*More about points later.
 
 
At the half, the Green Bay Packers lead the Philadelphia Eagles 14-3.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
*More about points later.

 

what?!
 
 
@ehBeth,

he's still making up rules.

please be patient...
 
 
@Rockhead,

Anyone who's online name starts with "B" and ends with a "W' - by rule, starts with 10 points.
 
 
@ehBeth,

I know I'm 3 out of 4.
 
 
Uh oh, I wouldn't want to be Akers...
 
 
Questions and Answers about this game:
Q: Why do you get to make up the rules rather then have them decided by a committee?
A: (deleted)
Q: Um, okay. Who wins?
A: The winner is the participant who successfully navigates his/her through to picking the SuperBowl winner.
Q: What if more than one player does that?
A: There is a tiebreaker system in place based on a prediction of the final score in the SuperBowl game.
Q: Why did we start with just the predictions in this week's Wildcard games?
A: Partially because I am a huckster. I was eager to pull as many people as I could into it. In addition, the NFL has some complicated rules regarding who would play whom after the Wildcard games. I settled on this week as being a "warmup."
Q: Why are players now being asked to now choose all the way through to the end in one sitting?
A: It is tough to get players when there are 4 games, or 2 games or 1. I am good at nagging, but I don't want to push my luck.
In addition, I am tired after 5 months of this. It's been fun, of course, but I am ready to be done with it. My baseball glove is in the closet, waiting to come out.
Q: What is this the "Points" thing all about?
A: In addition to having a winner based on the winner of the SuperBowl, there is a bit of a side game:
* Every correct pick in the Wildcard games gets a player 1 point plus a green star pasted on his/her forehead to show off at the the office.
* A correct pick in next week's Divisional games gets 2 points plus a message on your home answering machine in Latin by George.
* 5 points will be awarded to correct pickers in the Championship games and
* 6 points go to the folks who pick correctly in the SuperBowl game.
Q: Is it too late to join in?
A: Not at all. Watch this space tomorrow.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
Q: Why do you get to make up the rules rather then have them decided by a committee?

A2: You do the paperwork.

@realjohnboy,

how is cointoss faring?
 
 
Green Bay wins. The leader here is the Mexican guy, Fbaezer. He is 4-0.
What do Mexicans know about American football. There ought to be a law.
Oylok, Tsarstephen, McGentix and George are 3-1.
CoinToss is 2-2.
Wandeljw and SoupKitchen are 0-4.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I'm happy to be 2-2. I was getting worried for a while.
 
 
@ossobuco,

three outta four games right down to the wire.
me likey...

@realjohnboy,

Oylok, McGentix and George? Which one of you will help conspire with me to take down Fbaezer?

Remember the Alamo!!
 
 
 
GO PACKERS!

@fbaezer,

It's ok fbaezer - I'm here now!
 
 
@BillW,

Speaking of those pesky Pats, they're opening the odds at a spread of 8.5 points. I want some of that action (taking Pats).
 
 
@Ragman,

Don't you think this game will be close?
 
 
@George,

No. I think Pats will open a can of whoop ass. By the 4th quarter, I think they shut Rex Ryan's fat mouth.

How do you think it will sort out?
 
 
@BillW,

 
Oh, so you are rooting for the Patriots/

 

The hell I am!

It doesn't matter that they're the better team, or that I may pick them to win.

Go Jets!
¡Vamos Mark Sánchez!

Here We Go-
I am asking you to pick all the way through to the end in one sitting. That is, you need to pick all of the remaining 7 games before 4:30 ET on Saturday, January 15th. You also need to guess the final score in the Super Bowl.
Divisional Playoffs:
Game 1; Jan 15th, 4:30 pm- Baltimore @ Pittsburgh
Game 2; Jan 15th, 8:00 pm- Green Bay @ Atlanta
Game 3; Jan 16th, 1:00 pm- Seattle @ Chicago
Game 4; Jan 16th, 4:30 pm- NY Jets @ New England

Conference Championships:
Game 5; Jan 23rd, 3:00 pm- Winner of Game 3 vs Winner of Game 4
Game 6; Jan 23rd, 6:30 pm- Winner of Game 1 vs Winner of Game 2

Super Bowl Chamionship:
Game 7; Feb 6th, 6:30 pm- Winner of Game 5 vs Winner of Game 6 (+ score)

Q&A: Can I change a pick? Yes. You can change any pick up until kickoff of the 1st game on Saturday, Jan 15th at 4:30. But then you can not change any guess. Please feel free to post early and then come back to change based on further research, injuries, weather or whatever.
I didn't play during the Wild Card games this past weekend. Can I still play?
Absolutely. Last weekend was termed a warm up because the NFL has a complicated system of determining the match ups for next week. We had 30 players here. I can handle more.
Do I need to know anything about football? You're asking me-I don't know one end of a football from the other.
What do I win? BIG PRIZES. Actually you don't win squat. There are really 2 games going on here. One is to correctly pick the winner of the Super Bowl. If more than one player gets that right, I use the score in the Super Bowl game as the tie breaker. Please remember to post the final score. A 2nd game here is the awarding of points for each correct pick in the 7 games. You do get one of those little stick on stars you can wear on your forehead to the office, churchsynagoguemosque, or school.
More about that game as I continue to make up rules.
Thanks for playing. I look forward to having you join us.

Lets keep our AFC and NFC teams in the same bracket please.

For example (and my picks): Pittsburgh will be playing New England for AFC and Green Bay will be playing Chicago for NFC Championship.

New England will be beating Green Bay in the Super Bowl with a score of 38-17.

Are you going to join the unwashed huddled masses and grace us with your picks?
 
 
@realjohnboy,

prolly not.

with the dolphins out of things, and no brent favruh or dallas to root against, there is no joy in mudville for me.

when do pitchers and catchers report?
 
 
@Rockhead,

Yeah. Doesn't your baseball glove smell great. Every Spring when I pull it down from the shelf, it brings back memories of being 10 years old. Little League. And sometimes feigning sickness to miss school to listen to the Milwaukee Braves on the Mutual Radio Network's game of the day.
My mom was as fanatical about baseball as I was. Sometimes, even if the thermometer under my tongue read 98.6 she would let me stay home if Burdette or Spahn was pitching in a critical game.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I'm going to start umpiring this spring. (i think)

I'll know more when it gets warm.

haven't worn a cup for 20 years...

anyways, I think I have more fun here when I don't play the game. dunno...

@realjohnboy,

I remind yall again that my original posting of the schedule had an error. Please make sure that the picks you make are from the schedule below.
Thank you.

I
 
Corrected schedule, thanks to a heads-up from McGentrix.

 
Here We Go-
I am asking you to pick all the way through to the end in one sitting. That is, you need to pick all of the remaining 7 games before 4:30 ET on Saturday, January 15th. You also need to guess the final score in the Super Bowl.
Divisional Playoffs:
Game 1; Jan 15th, 4:30 pm- Baltimore @ Pittsburgh
Game 2; Jan 15th, 8:00 pm- Green Bay @ Atlanta
Game 3; Jan 16th, 1:00 pm- Seattle @ Chicago

Super Bowl Championship:
Game 7; Feb 6th, 6:30 pm- Winner of Game 5 vs Winner of Game 6 (+ score)

Q&A: Can I change a pick? Yes. You can change any pick up until kickoff of the 1st game on Saturday, Jan 15th at 4:30. But then you can not change any guess. Please feel free to post early and then come back to change based on further research, injuries, weather or whatever.
I didn't play during the Wild Card games this past weekend. Can I still play?
Absolutely. Last weekend was termed a warm up because the NFL has a complicated system of determining the match ups for next week. We had 30 players here. I can handle more.
Do I need to know anything about football? You're asking me-I don't know one end of a football from the other.
What do I win? BIG PRIZES. Actually you don't win squat. There are really 2 games going on here. One is to correctly pick the winner of the Super Bowl. If more than one player gets that right, I use the score in the Super Bowl game as the tie breaker. Please remember to post the final score. A 2nd game here is the awarding of points for each correct pick in the 7 games. You do get one of those little stick on stars you can wear on your forehead to the office, churchsynagoguemosque, or school.
More about that game as I continue to make up rules.
Thanks for playing. I look forward to having you join us.

I saw a fumble the other night and the ball popped about for a bit and the players dived on it and there was a dispute about who had got it. So they showed us a slow-moish re-run with a good view and I swear I saw a player from one side give it to a player from the other in the melee. They didn't show it twice of course.

I'm not saying that my eyes weren't deceiving me but that's what it looked like as far as I could tell. There wasn't a lot of ambiguity. Some--maybe. Not a lot.

That guy getting his heel out of the end zone just before catching the pass was a bit lucky for the other side.

Do players of losing teams at this stage get to go to sunny beaches and luxury hotels in the Caribbean when they are eliminated?

I have seen star players limp off in the third or fourth last match and next news it's announced they are out for the season. Next news they are in the gossip pages surfboarding with two bimbos in Antigua. Grinning sheepishly or like that American expression I am loathe to use on a clean-cut thread like this is.

The best thing about the appreciation of art, and the NFL is art, is knowing how it is done. One is not allowed to empty the money out of people's pockets, purses and placket-corners by taking them by the heels and shaking them.

@InfraBlue,

I've got a mac - will have to figure out how to do that.
Or maybe I'll switch to "domani".
Still can't decide on a couple of choices.
 
 
@spendius,

 
The best thing about the appreciation of art, and the NFL is art, is knowing how it is done. One is not allowed to empty the money out of people's pockets, purses and placket-corners by taking them by the heels and shaking them.
 

That's my response to the sports haters that have posted on this and other threads. Watching sports is like looking at art. Athletes are at the highest level of human physiological ability and development. Watching sports is to appreciate this aspect of humanity.

 
 
 

But then again, some people don't much care for art, either.
 
 
Culture on this thread? Ha. The closest thing we came to that before was pole dancing. That's another story.
22 players in so far. Keep the picks coming.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

The NFL is a cultural manifestation John. It both reflects a culture and takes it on to the next generation with degrees of adaptation. TV coverage being the most important. Have you tried calling up somebody at the game to see if the pictures on TV are delayed?

As I understand it it began on a sheet of paper in the twenties. Cathedrals begin like that and then evolve.

Salome was pole dancing and it wasn't original then.
 
 
AndyClubber's Picks:
1) Pittsburgh
2) Green Bay
3) Seattle
4) New England

5) Pittsburgh
6) Green Bay

7) Pittsburgh (24-21)
 
 
Late to the thread

I had picked Green Bay over Philadelphia and Baltimore over KC, but I was on the wrong side of the score with Seattle and the Jets

So I go into this weekend 2 for 4 (2 for 5 if you include my pick of Oregan over Auburn)

For the next round I'm picking:

Pittsburgh
New England
Atlanta
Seatle
 
 
Looking beyond this weekend it should be

Atlanta vs New England

New England wins it all

Thanks, Finn. Please predict the final score in the Super Bowl game.

 

24- 17
 
 
Amongst the players from the regular season, I am showing I still need picks from EhBeth, Osso, Ragman, Mysteryman, McGentrix, Panzade and Alex.
And, of course, I would be happy to accept picks from "newbies."

Fewer than 48 hours to join in.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Still deciding.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I will make my picks tonite, when I get home from work.
That will be in about 6 hours.

I would have the beans on toast first mm. A cup of tea and a rest next and then get down to this serious business.

(Tiebreaker score 20-17)
 
 
27 players in with 24 hours to go before the 1st game.
The 8 ESPN experts split 5-3 in favor of the Steelers over the Ravens.
By a 6-2 margin they have the Packers against the Falcons.
The Bears win out vs the SeaHawks 7-1.
And they are unanimous in picking the Patriots over the Jets.
I'll do the breakdown amongst players here an hour or so before kickoff tomorrow.
I hope we can rustle up a few more players overnight.
 
 
About an hour until the kick off of the Baltimore @ Pittsburgh game. It looks like weather will not be a huge factor. 37 degrees but with a wind running diagonally across the field at 18 mph.
19 of us are choosing the Steelers while 8 opt for the Ravens. I see it as being a game fought largely on the ground. The team with the better defense will probably win.
The night game between Green Bay and Atlanta will be played inside. We split 14-13 in favor of the Packers. Green Bay stalled mid-season but I think are underrated here.
Tomorrow's early game features Seattle @ Chicago. Only Finn, AndyClubber and Tico are picking the Seahawks.
The night game has the NY Jets @ New England. Mysteryman stands alone in opting for the Jets.
Under the rules here, every correct pick you make this round earns you a point. I'll be back later to do a thing about the scoring.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

And, oh yes, if anyone still wants to join in, the schedule is at the top of this page. But you have to hurry!

Pitsburgh leading: 0-0

That's an insurmountable lead!
 
 
Now, 7-0
 
 
@tsarstepan,

reminds me of a local radio news reporter who gives the hockey scores thusly:
"3-2, 4-2, 2-1, 3-1, and in overtime... 5-4"
 
 
@tsarstepan,

You look unusually perplexed, Tsar.
 
 
@edgarblythe,

 
Now, 7-0

 

Steelers.
I missed the 1st Ravens drive, resulting in a punt from what appears to me to be FG range. What was that about?
 
 
@realjohnboy,

perhaps he woulda been kicking into the wind...
 
 
I missed that part of the game. Too many phone calls.
 
 
@edgarblythe,

excuse me, ed...

phone's for you.
 
 
@Rockhead,

(psst -- let's all call edgar now...)
 
 
@Region Philbis,

it's busy...
 
 
@Rockhead,

keep trying...
 
 
7-7. Costly pass interference call on Pitt.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Arrgh. 14-7 Ravens after a fumble by Ben.
 
 
Oops.
 
 
@edgarblythe,

A horrible lapse by the Steelers on Ben's fumble. Horrible.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I would not have believed it.
 
 
This is nuts!
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
19 of us are choosing the Steelers while 8 opt for the Ravens. The team with the better defense will probably win.

 
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Wow. There's something seriously wrong with this picture!
 
 
Did Flacco really not expect that floated pass on 1st down to get picked off? And that snap was ridiculous.
 
 
Defense:
Total offensive yardage thus far: Baltimore- 111; Pittsburgh- 199
Turnovers: Baltimore- 3; Pittsburgh- 2
 
 
@realjohnboy,

ravens are threatening...
 
 
@Rockhead,

...but only come up with a FG. 24-24. Exciting game.
 
 
Looooooong pass !!!!!
 
 
Wa hooo!!!!!
 
 
@edgarblythe,

Work the clock. But score.
 
 
@edgarblythe,

The Steelers are the one yard line and the Ravens are on the proverbial ropes.
 
 
@tsarstepan,

fork 'em.

they're done...
 
 
@Rockhead,

Stooopid kickoff - --
 
 
@edgarblythe,

that does seem kinda silly...
 
 
ouch.

dunno who Z Hood is, but that sounded painful...

(sacked by Z Hood. 4th and 18)
 
 
Oh my. Houzawhatever is going to be replaying that one in his head for a long time.
 
 
Well, now I see their plan. Don't give'em a chance to return it for a touchdown. Turnover on downs now. It is finished.
 
 
@edgarblythe,

Bye bye ravens! See you next year!!
 
 
Ravens is tough. I tip my ballcap to them.
 
 
Wow,again. Talk about two different halves of football.
 
 
Edgar Allen Poe would have fun with this.
Tap, tap, tap
go the nails
in the Raven's coffin.

(Poe as you may recall left UVA and went to Baltimore).
 
 
I don't quite know what to make of that game. The crowd was sent home happy though.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

damn.

I'm left rooting for Hotlanta, I guess.

I'm gonna go oil my glove...
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
Edgar Allen Poe would have fun with this.
Tap, tap, tap
go the nails
in the Raven's coffin.

(Poe as you may recall left UVA and went to Baltimore).

 

Nevermore.
 
 
Fbaezer gets hurt bad with Baltimore's loss. He had them winning in the Super Bowl. Oylok and Mysteryman had the Ravens winning next week.
I will try to get around to the other game, the awarding of points for correct picks thing, tomorrow.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

That was close..
 
 
ok.

somebody with a tv...

what the hell just happened.

Atlanta was almost in field goal range, with 15 seconds, and boom.

GB scored. no story.

a little help?
 
 
Wow.....

It's that kinda night.
 
 
@Rockhead,

I missed it. Went to the bathroom.
 
 
@edgarblythe,

I figgered you for on the phone...
 
 
Replay: They decide to pass for a few more yards, get intercepted. GB runs a very long TD.
 
 
@edgarblythe,

Say goodbye, Atlanta! Starks should run it down their throat for the 2nd half.
 
 
GB quarterback ran it in.
 
 
It's been a very long time since I've had this much fun watching Green Bay.

I promised my family I'd only watch 'til halftime. Um.

Then I promised them that if GB made this touchdown, I'd turn it off because a 21-pt lead, right?

Um.
 
 
I have always liked Green Bay, but I picked them to lose.
 
 
@edgarblythe,

Green Bay leading 42-14
 
 
Oof! I'm happy for Soz, though.
 
 
@edgarblythe,

I wonder what Brent is doing tonight?
 
 
@Rockhead,

The Falcons are sitting on the sidelines now, watching GB run the ball up and down the field. Several appear to be twittering or whatever Tweeters do.
 
 
@edgarblythe,

spread bad karma, I think...
 
 
well, this has turned into a game only a packers fan could love...
 
 
@Rockhead,

Nah - - -
Millions want one way - more milions want another way. One person at home on a computer has no affect on karma in this game. I was pulling for the Falcons, by the way.
 
 
I picked the Packers first and changed to Atlanta, but I'm happy for them.
 
 
I think the game ended 48-21. I changed channels to watch the local news.
 
 
I have not been feeling real well lately. I lay down just as the Green Bay-Atlanta game started. I woke up just as it ended. My sleep schedule for tonight is totally screwed up. I'll probably end up playing on-line scrabble for a few hours.

Green Bay romps. Bad news for the 14 players here who picked the Falcons to win today. And really bad news for JPB, Mysteryman, Coastalrat and Oylok who thought Atlanta would win the Super Bowl. They join Fbaezer on the sidelines.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

many triple word scores to you, unsleepy sir...

fbaezer was a lot like the Detroit Lions.

kings of the pre-season...
 
 
@Rockhead,

I watched the highlights. Aaron Rogers had a great game. He faces either Chicago or Seattle next week.
 
 
@edgarblythe,

 
I changed channels to watch the local news.
 
i switched over to Transformers...  

the pittsburgh game, OTOH, was compelling throughout...
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Yeah, Aaron Rogers was definitely in the zone. Bears/Packers is gonna be fun.
 
 
@JPB,

Thanks!

I did turn it off after it was a 28-point lead. I'm still bummed I missed the end though. The next game is at 3:00 PM (January 23rd), that's more like it.

The momentum seems to be fantastic -- things are coming together at just the right time. Hope that B.J. Raji's head injury doesn't turn out to be serious, I think he's an important piece of the puzzle. Plus Starks suddenly turning into a real force. What they've already had + running game = wow.
 
 
Hi. Two games down and two more to go today. The Steelers-Ravens game left me (although not my sinuses) drained. And Aaron Rogers is finally getting the recognition he deserves. Only Tico has Green Bay winning the Super Bowl, by the way.
The early game, in less then 2 hours, features the Seahawks @ the Bears. I see that it is 20 degrees and cloudy and the wind in the Windy City is from the WNW at 10 mph.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Go, Chicago!
On the SB, I'm now all for Green Bay while filled with regret for switching from them in my selection.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
Only Tico has Green Bay winning the Super Bowl, by the way.
 

Nuh-uh! Me too!

 http://able2know.org/topic/166120-11#post-4473194 

Hope you're feeling better soon rjb....
 
 
You are correct, of course, Soz.
 
 
We are off and running, or passing, or blocking and tackling.
 
 
That was quick. Chicago 7-0.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

go beers.
 
 
Snow!
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Warmer in Salmon than Chicago. Here, it's 38 degrees and raining on top of nearly a foot of snow. Lovely!
 
 
This game is getting ugly. 21-0 Chicago midway through the 2nd quarter.
 
 
so, are the Lions in the Superbowl yet?
 
 
@djjd62,

Has hell frozen over?

Seriously, they're much better than they've been in years.
 
 
The Seahawks look totally hapless. Not sure if it's the snow or just that their path here has been so flukey and they're not actually a playoff-caliber team.

Or both.
 
 
Is it snowing? I don't have a tv, so instead just follow the play by play without video.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

like on the radio?

but without those annoying announcers...
 
 
@realjohnboy,

It's snowing, yeah! Teams of dudes with leaf blowers prowling the yard markers at breaks to keep them visible. Cold, swirly snow (I think it's mid-20's there -- snow in warmer weather is heavier and less swirly). Not a lot of it and seems to have let up a bit. Maybe 1-2 inches has fallen since the game started.

And these goofs are playing in shirtsleeves. Some of them have those long-sleeved underlayers on but not many.
 
 
@Rockhead,

On my computer, with a little update of each play scrolling across my screen, like "Cutler incomplete deep right."
I am not really into the NFL games themselves.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 

(i watch in the same fashion)

no tv in the woods, either.
 
 
I do have a TV but it's when I watch football that I realize that the producers expect everyone to have a giant screen. I emphatically do NOT. It's a cubist 20-inch Trinitron. I can make out what's going on but the graphics are ridiculously teeny and lo-res, to the point where I can't make out most of the text even if I'm standing 10 inches away.

I just measured, with the black bands at the top and bottom (letterboxing?), the actual image is 10 inches by 16 inches.

Ooh, Cutler barely escaped there. If the Seahawks were a little less hapless that'd have been an interception.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
I have not been feeling real well lately. I lay down just as the Green Bay-Atlanta game started. I woke up just as it ended. My sleep schedule for tonight is totally screwed up.
 

I can relate, johnboy. Today I have been in bed all day with a cold. Can anyone tell me the score of the Seattle game?
 
 
@wandeljw,

21 zip.

da bears...

mid 3rd qtr.

get better jw.
 
 
@Rockhead,

I was joking. Thanks, anyway.
 
 
@wandeljw,

you need a funny hat, so I don't miss them...
 
 
For those not watching, the snow is pretty much done -- the odd flake now and then maybe. Visibility seems much better. Probably won't actually help the Seahawks much.... ooh that was almost a td though. Interference!
 
 
Oh man, here we go. Patriots/Jets.
I hope the Pates can do it, but the Jets are REALLY revved.
 
 
@George,

Welker isn't starting.
Coach Hoodie was not amused by his "foot" interview.
 
 
Rhys and I are sitting here sipping hot mulled wine.
Expect my posts to deteriorate.
(Aw right, who said " How can we tell?")
 
 
The Seahawks scored 20-some points? Did da Bears pull there players?
 
 
Jets take the kickoff.
Get a first.
Forced to punt on 4th and 5.
 
 
Patriots' ball.
Woodhead gets a first.
Tate gets a first.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I don't think so (I admit I was half-watching towards the end), just the visibility improved and the Bears' intensity went down a notch and things started going the Seahawks' way. Too little too late of course.

Bears and Packers have only met for the NFC championship once before... in 1941!! That's amazing. Looking forward to it, though the forecast looks like it'll be an equally cold day and I know Rodgers has been enjoying the domes.
 
 
@George,

Brady to Gronk.
First down.
 
 
Interception!!!
 
 
@George,

Brady is intercepted!
 
 
Ye ha
 
 
3rd and 18 for the Jets.
They'll go for a field goal.
 
 
Hooked it. No good.
 
 
@George,

NO GOOD!!!
 
 
What a crazy game so far! (FG missed at short range.)
 
 
The Jets can't afford that.
 
 
Man-oh-man, I do NOT have a good feeling about this.
 
 
LawFirm for a first.
Krumpler for another first.
 
 
The 12th Man.
This idea was tossed over my transom by someone not on A2K or involved in our game.
Tom Brady is the QB for the Patriots. He is 32 years old and is regarded as quite physically attractive. His wife, a model, is beautiful as are, I'm sure, their kid(s).
But there is his hair.
He wears his hair long, getting close to his eyebrows and the middle of his ears on the sides. It is considered unusual where buzz-cuts are more the norm.
There was a time in my life, before but mostly after service in the army, when my hair came close to touching my shoulders.
A suggestion was made that I Google in "Tom Brady long hair."
I did.
My God! There are people absolutely obsessed with Brady's hair. Does he wear it that long because he is combing over a balding spot? Is his wife demanding that he not get a haircut...or else?
 
 
AAARRRGGGH!
 
 
Brady sacked. Jets D lookin tough in the red zone.
 
 
Patriots forced to settle for 3.
 
 
Patriots 3 - 0 Jets
 
 
Refilled my mulled wine mug.
Don't know why I'm telling you that.
 
 
@George,

2 to 1 George vs Rhys. Drink up, lad.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

You are contributing to the delinquency of a major (senior?).
 
 
Why don't the Jets run wider?
 
 
Jets punt.
Goes through the endzone.
Patriots start on the 20.

Commercial featuring Peyton.
Kinda sad, really.
 
 
Brady sacked again.
This does not look good.
 
 
@George,

Patriots punt.
 
 
Oh, my.
 
 
Jets touchdown.
Worser and worserer.
 
 
Three and out for the Patriots.
The Jets have got their number.
 
 
@George,

They really do! Plus the Patriots just seem off. I think some of it is that the Jets are throwing them off but they also just seem to not be doing stuff right.

Welker is out, maybe they'll perk up when he comes back in. (Just a bit hubristic of Bellichick to bench him I think.)
 
 
Pass interference on the Patriots.
 
 
@George,

Sanchez looking good.
 
 
First down Jets.
They are marching.
 
 
@George,

Or is it a first? Challenge flag thrown by Coach Hoodie.
 
 
@George,

Ruling Stands.
 
 
oops.
 
 
Wow. This is turning into a disaster.
 
 
Touchdown Jets.
 
 
Just walked back into the room to see the Jets score. Pats need to regroup at halftime if they're going to have a chance.
 
 
@George,

Bracnch gets that ball ripped out.
INCOMPLETE.
 
 
@George,

Can anybody tell me the last time they remember fans in Foxboro booing the Pats?
 
 
Patriots can't believe it.
 
 
@JPB,

If you recall, the halftime score was a lot more lopsided than this yesterday in Pittsburgh. This one's a long way from over.
 
 
@CowDoc,

Seriously?
The entire history of the team pre-2001
 
 
Need a refill.
Where's Rhys?
 
 
Wow! Total play by play. I should turn my television off.
 
 
@wandeljw,

 
Wow! Total play by play. I should turn my television off.

 

So should I.
 
 
@sozobe,

Also stupid, perhaps affecting morale.
 
 
@George,

I know, George, but I meant recently - it's been a while since I've heard the Philly-style cheers in New England.
 
 
It was 3-0 last I looked (making my first loaf of fast no knead wheat bread that doesn't take long to put together). Geez louise.

Pass that pitcher of mulled wine, George...
 
 
@CowDoc,

Yeah, I think there's been some over the past couple of years, but I
couldn't pinpoint it. What most fans don't realize is that this team is
overachieving. Bill Parcells notwithstanding, they aren't what their record
says they are.
 
 
@wandeljw,

Everything I know about American football (and specific games), I learn through these threads. Still have never watched a game.
 
 
2nd half starts. 14-3 Jets,
 
 
Second half.
Patriots forced to punt on their first possession.
 
 
Now Jets punt.
Patriots will start at the 20.
 
 
@ossobuco,

That bread would go well with the fish stew I've got simmering. The same thing happened here. I chopped a few veggies, threw some of this and that into a pot and came back to the Jets going up 14-3.
 
 
Whoa.
Nice reverse.
First down.
 
 
Long one. Incomplete. Bad sign.
 
 
Brady's getting slammed.
Another punt.
 
 
Whoa...
 
 
Great run by Greene. Jets are rolling.
 
 
@George,

rut roh...

the patriots are hearing footsteps.
 
 
Sanchez fails to complete twice. The drive is stalled.
 
 
@Rockhead,

 
rut roh...

the patriots are hearing footsteps.

 

Yeah, but not behind them. In front of them.
 
 
@JPB,

We should swap, JPB - I just finished an Irish-type soup (substituted beef for lamb stew meat) but no matter what I do, I can't seem to do an Irish dish that's not bland. Goes good with fresh bread, though.
 
 
Jets punt.
Patriots will start at their own 20.
Can they get something going?
 
 
Brady to Gronk.
That's more like it.
 
 
And now fizzling...
 
 
Branch pulls it out. First down!
 
 
Branch again.
First down again.
 
 
@George,

Whooop! It's about time! Touchdown PATS!
 
 
@tsarstepan,

TWO POINT CONVERT IS GOOD!

Now I feel so much better!
 
 
Two-point conversion.
Patriots 11 - 14 Jets.
 
 
Friggin hamster keeps telling me I can't post because of Flood Prevention.

UP YOURS, BUCKY!!!
 
 
@George,

space
 
 
@ehBeth,

jets zooming in........
 
 
Holy Crap!
 
 
I just got back from the bathroom.
Jets touchdown.
Yikes.
 
 
@George,

speak to us George!
 
 
Last of the mulled wine.
Rhys retreated to the basement family room.
 
 
Fumble!
Hate to say it, but this game is over.
 
 
I wouldn't give up for a bit longer. One never knows -
 
 
Incomplete. Crumpler held, but no call.
 
 
Brady to Branch. First down.
 
 
Woodhead runs for another first.
 
 
Pass to Welker. First down.
 
 
Time is slipping away.
 
 
I wouldn't give up yet, George (or Rhys). I went through hell yesterday with the Steelers.
 
 
time keeps on slipping slipping slipping slipping away
 
 
I don't agree with going for it there.
 
 
Fourth and thirteen.
Incomplete.
Another nail.
 
 
Dumb!
 
 
Patriots looking at elimination.
 
 
@George,

Patriots not calling timeout!
What gives?
 
 
Edelman returns the punt to the Jets 42.
 
 
ommmmmmm
 
 
Jets' Bart Scott is down.
Clock stopped.
 
 
@George,

Two scores needed with three minutes to go.
 
 
2:56 remaining.
Patriots need two scores, at least one touchdown.
 
 
Third and ten at the Jets 18.
 
 
Patriots try a field goal but don't get it off before the two-minute warning.
 
 
...they do get the next try but lose the onside kick. oooh. that was their last best chance though they could still pull it off.
 
 
Didn't rjb say that this was the only gimme game?
 
 
and that's all she wrote.

sorry george.
 
 
The fat lady sings.
 
 
Wow. Another shocker.
 
 
 

 
 
 
Darn good thing the Jets got that score. It's not over yet.
 
 
Now it is.
 
 
@JPB,

yes it is - it's official
 
 
 
END GAME
1-10-NE 43 (:23) M.Sanchez kneels to NE 44 for -1 yards.
0-0-NE 30 (Onside Kick formation) S.Graham kicks 13 yards from NE 30 to NE 43. E.Smith (didn't try to advance) to NE 43 for no gain (J.Page).
 
 
 
I may vomit.
 
 
@ehBeth,

....and so go a whole bunch of us who had the Pats to win it all........
 
 
No matter where you live, I would like for you to face towards where you think western Kentucky might be and give a nod to my friend Mysteryman.
He was the only player who picked the Jets over the Patriots.
Well done.
 
 
@JPB,

Yikes, just came back in to see the final happen, 28-21, the wrong way. I got tired of Sanchez's flakiness when he was my fantasy qb, not to mention I pulled Greene as my main rb and he dallied for a miserable number of games. Plus I don't just hate the Patriots.

Fish stew and irish stew are sounding good.. the bread has a while more to slowly rise. All my attempts at irish stew have turned out badly, which is revoltin' given my heritage.

I went out to see if my car would start re an appointment tomorrow and gahhhh.. so I got a charge from a neighbor and let it run for a bit while I turned sudden saint and did some weeding. So... I got to miss just how fast I'm doing just how badly on this here super bowl thread.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I bow to mysteryman's expertise.

I toally dumbfounded about Pats!
 
 
Belichick says, "didn't score enough, gave up to many points, bad field position." Duh!
 
 
You are still alive, osso, in the picking of the Super Bowl winner. You and Sozobe have Green Bay. Johnboy, AndyClubber, Edgar and Parados have Pittsburgh while Wandeljw has Chicago.
I will do the points thing tomorrow.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Didn't Tico also have the Pack?
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Didn't I pick the Pats? I dunno, I kept changing my mind and finally posted to get it over with.
 
 
Correct. I got off a column. Osso had NE, while Tico has Green Bay.
 
 
@ossobuco,

RJ, unfortunately these are my choices -

 
Jets at Patriots - Patriots
Ravens at Steelers - Steelers
Seahawks at Bears - Bears
Packers at Falcons - Falcons

Steelers & Patriots - Patriots
Bears & Falcons - Falcons

Patriots and Falcons - Patriots
35-24

 

Go, Packers!
 
 
@ossobuco,

Does this mean I need to find a cheesy hat?
 
 
@George,

too much wine.
 
 
@ossobuco,

 

luckily (?) these were my high school colours so I've still got a coupla appropriate (?) tams
 
 
@ehBeth,

Yeh, a beret is more my style than a cheese triangle..
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
No matter where you live, I would like for you to face towards where you
think western Kentucky might be and give a nod to my friend Mysteryman.
He was the only player who picked the Jets over the Patriots.
Well done.

 

I have just turned toward KY and given Mysteryman the... nod.
 
 
@JPB,

 
too much wine.

 

Oh, yeah.
 
 
Bears versus Packers next Sunday will be the real Super Bowl for me.

I originally believed that if the Bears did make it to the Super Bowl, they would be playing New England.
 
 
@George,

 
 
No matter where you live, I would like for you to face towards where you

How brave of George. God love him!
 
 
@wandeljw,

I'd love to know who's still in the competition (in this topic), and where they stand on their predictions.
 
 
@jespah,

Jes, if my data are correct (and that could be damned dicey), here you go---

Four of us have the Steelers winning it all, with three picking them over the Pack:

Edgar 38-17, Johnboy 27-24, and AndyClubber 24-21. Parados has them beating the Bears 21-17.

Sozobe and Ticomaya have the Packers over New England, 24-17 and 28-21 respectively.

Wandeljw has the Bears over the Pats 28-14.

For some reason, no one had the Jets or Seahawks advancing to Dallas.

Ehbeth got both NFC games right, and both AFC games wrong, but didn't pick past yesterday. Does that fit your your records, rjb?
 
 
@jespah,

I'm wasted, weary and worn out jes. The Champ's on the ropes. Tico will be pleased.
 
 
@spendius,

" Body blow!... Body blow! " -- Punch-Out (1984)

Hard luck, Spendi. I predicted horribly, but you somehow managed to do worse.
 
 
@CowDoc,

Thanks, Cowdoc. Your data squares with mine.
I awarded 1 point to each correct pick in the Wild Card games a week ago and 2 points for a good prediction this past weekend. Each of the 2 games next weekend is worth 5 points with 6 points for a correct pick in the Super Bowl.
Mysteryman's jubilation was short-lived. While he was the only player to pick the Jets, he has Baltimore and Atlanta winning next week and neither will be playing. He is done. He is not alone.
Mysteryman, JPB, Osso, Cowdoc, Lmur and BillW have 6 points each but can not earn any more. Joining them on the bench are LiontamerX, Rhys and Oylek (5 points each); CoastalRat (4); Spendius (3) and Finn (2).
George has 9 points thus far and will have the opportunity to add 5 points next weekend (i.e. he will have 1 team playing-Green Bay).
Johnboy and Parados are at 8 and can add 10 more. They both have Pittsburgh and Green Bay.
Fbaezer, Region and Sozobe have 8 points and the opportunity for 5 more if Green Bay advances.
Edgar has earned 7 and can possibly get 10 more if Pittsburgh and Green Bay advance. Also at 7 but with the chance to pick up only 5 more next week are Ragman (going with Green Bay), Miz Cowdoc and Tsarstepen (both picking Chicago).
Wandeljw has 6 and can gather 5 more if Chicago gets a win. AndyClubber has 5 and has Pittsburgh and Green Bay. Jespah, also at 5, has Green Bay.
Tico and Aidan have each collected 4 points thus far and have Green Bay and Chicago still in their surveyors' hairs.

Please let me know if you catch any errors. The scorecard I designed for myself turns out to not be very user friendly.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I have to look back, as I seem to remember a whole kit and kaboodle of people chose the same as I did. I may be confused, though, what with all my mind changing before finally typing my choice. I remember thinking, hey, I chose the same as spendius. (do not trust me)

Nevermind, I'm probably remember the 1st four past the wildcard round.
 
 
@ossobuco,

I have you choosing the Steelers over the Ravens while Spendius had it the other way around.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Ok, that's excellent news..
 
 
Thanks for the info -- still fun to follow along (and trash talk the other participants, of course).  
 
 
@ossobuco,

So we might add graciousness to all your other charms osso.
 
 
@spendius,

Well, it's fun to best the best on pick'um, however slightly.
Now who do you pick to win...
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
No matter where you live, I would like for you to face towards where you think western Kentucky might be and give a nod to my friend Mysteryman.
He was the only player who picked the Jets over the Patriots.
Well done.
 

I just turned my back on western Kentucky, bent over and shot the moon!
 
 
how bad were the pates on sunday?
during the regular season, they went 4-1 against the four remaining teams in the hunt,
winning by an aggregate score of 165-91...
