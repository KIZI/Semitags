The following editorial appeared in Friday's Washington Post:

Political sleaze is not unknown in Virginia politics, but it tends to
come in discrete doses rather than wholesale bins. Yes, there was S. Vance
Wilkins Jr., who was forced to resign as speaker of the House of Delegates
in 2002 after The Post reported that he had paid $100,000 to a former female
staffer so she would keep quiet about unwelcome sexual advances. Still,
that's a far cry from the shenanigans that regularly delight reporters on
the statehouse beats in Louisiana and New Jersey, to say nothing of
Illinois.

Especially rare is the pure mercenary in the Old Dominion, where the
decorous example of the Founding Fathers, much mentioned in Richmond's halls
of power, imparts a certain tendency to propriety. So it was with some
surprise that the state's political heavyweights discovered that one of
their number, Phillip A. Hamilton, a long-serving and powerful member of the
House of Delegates, had mixed his legislative clout and his personal
finances.

Hamilton, a Republican who represents Newport News, sought funds for a
new teaching center at Old Dominion University even as he pressed university
officials for a job at the center. In a series of e-mails in 2006 and 2007,
Hamilton made no bones about his salary requirements or the quid pro quo he
had in mind. After initial stonewalling, Hamilton came clean after the
e-mails were made public by the university last week. He resigned the
part-time job he had arranged for himself there, at an annual salary of
$40,000. "I think it creates the perception of impropriety, absolutely," he
told the Daily Press of Newport News.

Yes, it does. Democrats, who see the Hamilton affair as enhancing their
chances of recapturing a majority in the House in this fall's elections,
have wasted no time calling on Hamilton to resign from the legislature.
Republicans, fearing the affair will cost them, are jumping on the
resignation bandwagon, too, or are at least backing an ethics investigation.
So far, Hamilton is hanging on and pursuing reelection. In a purely
political season, the parties' grandees have done that rarest of things --
joined hands to condemn one of their own. True, it may all be impelled by
self-interest, but in the process, they may also extend Virginia's
reputation for good government.
