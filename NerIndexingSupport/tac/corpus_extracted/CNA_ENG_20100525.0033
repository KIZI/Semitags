A Taiwan-designed poster has won a silver in the 89th annual awards competition
held by the New York-based Art Directors Club (ADC), marking the first time a
contestant from Taiwan has been honored by the professional association.

The poster, focusing on the theme "global warming, " was created by Leon Lin, an
associate professor at National Taiwan Normal University's Department of Visual
Design.

The awards presentation ceremony was held in New York on May 19.

Lin said in a news conference in Taipei Tuesday that the poster, which shows the
silhouette of a man about to drown, depicts the survival crisis faced by humans.

"It symbolizes the melting icebergs and rising sea level that will soon engulf
small island countries such as the Maldives, " Lin explained.

He classified the work of white and blue as a minimalist design following the
concept "less is more."

"It looks simple, but is nonetheless humanistic," he said.

This year's ADC competition, which drew around 20,000 entries worldwide, is the
fifth Lin participated in.

The ADC Awards were launched in 1920 to identify and honor the best work of the
year in visual communications. Today, the number of categories covered by the
competition totals 238, spanning print and broadcast advertising, interactive
media, graphic design, publication design, packaging, photography and
illustration.
