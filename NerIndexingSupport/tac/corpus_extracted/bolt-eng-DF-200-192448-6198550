 http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/new...cle2368707.ece 

This made me laugh, does he really think that we would just let our navy be sunk by a load of crappy Russian and Iranian technology. I do hope the US carrier group shows up sometime soon to liberate the country and get ready of the socialist dictator.
 
 
Perhaps an economic embargo imposed by our eminantly sinkable Royal Navy?
 
 
Or a Trident on their capital, he's controlled his economy so much Venezuela will be a third world socialist hell hole by the end of his reign.
 
 
crappy ^o) ?

How libertarian of you  
 
 
Relax, I expect Chavez to drop dead any time soon due to the gargantuan size of his head forcing his neck to snap like a twig.

It was a political stunt for regional consumption - much like Bush standing on the carrier in front of 'Mission Accomplished' was meant for Missouri rather than Mosul.

Killing civilians unnecessarily will not defend economic, military and strategic assets.
 
 
It seems Chavez is thinking about moving from being an irritating, if largely ignorable, annoyance, to being an actual threat. That can only end badly for him, the Americans have historically not taken kindly to belligerence and hostile military build-ups in their backyard. And no matter how many Russian planes he buys, the USAF is not exactly going to be threatened for dominance.
 
 
Is the US military really up to another foreign war?
 
 
no one takes him seriously, as shown by the fact the British government haven't issued a statement and clearly don't care. Moreover Chavez isn't going to spend millions attempting to take a tiny rock when he'd probably get his country sanctioned and possibly bombed therby losing his position. It's merely rhetoric designed to bring him greater internal prestige. To anyone outside latin america, or anyone with any sense in my opinion, he comes across as desperate and should just be ignored until he's willing to speak sensibly. There is no need for escalation of the situation.

Yes. It wouldn't be a costly and time-consuming invasion/occupation to cut Chavez down to size and stop his belligerency. The US could send a very effective message by wiping out any effective military capability of Venezuela in about an afternoon.

Yes, precisley. Most of South America are on his side because he unites them, and gives them a chance to stand up for themselves after years of dodgy CIA interference in their affairs.

I concur. He's an absolute fool if he thinks this is going to do anything but destroy him.

Dictator???
I think you will find he is the head of a democracy. Elected by the people of a nation rich in oil. Which is probably why the CIA tried to enforce a coup, which lasted for a whole 2 days before the people protested in the streets.

To be honest he is just druming up support in latin america and good luck to them I say its about time the USA lost some of its dominance in the americas. After all it was the CIA who backed Pinochet.

What world do you live in? Most Latin Americans hate Chavez for interfering in their domestic affairs. Unlike the US, Chavez openly backs and funds his favored candidates in Latin American countries. He is loathed in large parts of Latin America, even in those that support leftist policies. And I'm amazed that you'd condemn CIA interference in Latin America, and support Chavez' interference in Latin America in the same sentence. You are without a shadow of a doubt the biggest support of tyrants on this planet.

I love the hypocrisy of people who condemn American actions from 3.5 decades ago while supporting the exact same kind of actions from Chavez today.

Where as the US try to do it a covertly as they can. minipulating markets establishing false economies. Im not arguing that Chavez is a good idea...although i do quite like some of his domestic policies....just that the americans need to back of the South and cuba.

Sure, so in the last 60 years how many governments has the USA/CIA deposed do you suppose? the answers is 50+ the majority of which were democratically elected.

We already established that your knowledge of economics is nonexistent. Drop this line of reasoning before you make even more of a fool out of yourself.

Please provide a list of said governments. This should be fun.

So US trying to influence elections in Latin America 3 decades ago is bad, but Chavez doing the exact same thing right now is good? I love it how the blatant hypocrisy doesn't bother you.
 
 
Looks like a job for the Type 45's

Wow, you have one huge chip on your shoulder regarding chavez. Are you seriously comparing the CIA training militias such as the contras who raped and murdered civilians to Chavez? Goof.

And please tell me where you've got your information that Latin Americans, by a majority, hate Chavez.

Oh and Freedom House   The home of partiality.

I don't recall chavez sending troops to El Salvadore and Panama during elections. They are not comparable, chavez is expressing his opinion about his neighbours not sending in troops.

And by the way you claim that the majority of Latin Americans dislike Chavez, got a source or just quoting Fox news?

Looking from a purely maritime point of view a lot of things could potentially happen in the event that Venezuela does attack the Falkland Islands. Britain's navy is not what it was 30 year ago (I would just like to point out that I don't think there is a snowballs chance in hell that he would succeed in concurring the Falklands) and we are currently tied up in two wars, albeit one of the countries does not have a navy and the navy of the other country is quite frankly crap. But on that note the Iranians did kidnap British service personell.

Yes the Royal navy is one of the most advanced in the world but it is currently only equipped to face an enemy (in my opinion) who is equally advanced. Again, the Iranians kidnapped our personell and we could do nothing because we don't have any "light" equipment. The Venezuelans may buy this and that weapon from that rough country or the other; they will never be as advanced as the Royal navy. But on the other hand they do have the advantage of distance to the Falklands and if they are bold enough they could wipe a potential task force on its way to liberate the islands once again.

My point; even though Venezuela is one of those countries that could be wiped out during after-noon tea by the US Navy does not mean that they cannot inflict serious damage, especially when they are headed by Chavez. The majority of the past dictators always landed themselves in some unnecessary war - that is why Chavez is so dangerous.

You said the US deposed 50+ democratic governments. Either provide the list or retract the claim.

By expressing his opinion, you mean providing a massive amount of funding and threatening to provoke a civil war if the people don't vote for his candidate?

It's also a very good way to totally **** things up.

Democracy cannot be imposed upon people who aren't ready or don't want it, it can only be established with the cooperation of the people.

They havent desposed over 50 but a fair few they have.

And when did he threaten to provoke a civil war? Honestly, where do you get your news?

Edit: I see you have completely ignored my previous post.

Because as far as I'm concerned, you're Chavez' spokesmen.

Threatening somebody in order to have them obey the law is hardly the same as general sabre-rattling.

Well, that's pretty much exactly what it is where international law is concerned - 'the law' is often used as an excuse for sabre-rattling.

Or should we just cite Afghanistan? The sovereignty of the Afghan state was violated - should we have attacked the US?

We were part of the violation though...
 
 
States don't have sovereignty, peope do. Sometimes states have sovereignty as well, but only if its subject people choose to give it sovereignty. The Afghan, Iraqi and Iranian states violate(d) their subjects' sovereignty, so destroying them is perfectly justifiable.

I expose you for some of the misinformed blinkered ****e that you write and all of the sudden im Chavez' spokesman. Well done.

Still havent answered the question.
 
 
Oh and just some of the criticisms i have of Chavez.

1. Crime - during his tenure, crime has risen to the point where Caracas is the most dangerous city in Latin America. Actually, both the Americas. Its been nothing short of incompetence thanks to police corruption and not enough time and resources has been spent on what is a serious issue.

2. the Currency - His policy is somewhat mystifying, bordering on economic naivety, trying to manipulate prices isnt going to work and its a lazy and quite frankly, stupid method of controlling inflation which is the highest in Latin America.

3. The process in which RCTVs licence was not renewed and the show which replaced it, TVES.

4. The proposals hes given to amend the constitution. Some of his proposals just don't make sense, especially the one when he wants to decrease the working hours people are allowed to work in a week. Economically it just doesnt make sense. And whilst the oppostion blabbers on about "unlimited terms", which correct me if im wrong, a lot of countries have, including France. Its his other proposals they should be focusing on. I really hope Venezuelans see sense and vote against these proposals in the referendum (how undemocratic).

Now please, answer my questions. When has Chavez shut down political opponents. Has Chavez funded militias to other-throw other Governments like the CIA did? And when did he threat to provoke a Civil war if certain candidates in other countries dont get voted in?

Ta.

Even though your argument is poo IMO, if we follow it through, I do remind you that 98% of the people voted for an Islamic government in Iran in a referendum after the revolution.

And a plurality voted for Hitler. Being elected by democratic means does not mean that anything that comes after the election is democratic.

Didn't think Godwin's law would invoked that fast...

Nah but how exactly is the Iranian people's sovereignty violated?

It's a relevant example. Are you really saying that if someone gets elected democratically that he can't become a tyrant later? Do you actually believe the 98% figure by the way? No democratic election leads to such lop-sided results.

I haven't made that argument. I'm not the greatest fan of the individual sovereignty argument.

Iran may be tenously democratic but it isn't liberal. Even if 98% of people did vote for Khomeini in '79 which quite frankly I am incredibly dubious about then the latter 2% are still having there rights infringed upon. The lack of freedom of religion is one classic example of this. Democracy is ineffectual without liberalism underpinning it.

But yes I take your point.
 
 
If he invaded the Falklands, he'd lose that nice lucrative contract Red Ken just gave him.

That aside, Britain has air and naval superiority over any Latin American country you care to name. If Chavez wants to send large numbers of his people to fight a war they do not want purely in the interests of his expansionist desires (if you can't beat 'em, join 'em, I guess), that is his affair, but he need not expect many of them to come back. This would be a pity, because live people are preferable to dead ones.
 
 
Except that he's not going to do that - this was, to all intents and purposes, an internal political move. Hence why the British government isn't threatening to send a taskforce, and why Vulcans aren't bombing the presidential palace in Caracas.
Further proof, if any was required, that HMG doesn't listen to TSR - thank god.

And hence my use of the word "if".

Still, I half wish he would start something.

I asked for a concrete list, not the ravings of an anti-war lunatic. If you actually believe you're right, it shouldn't be that hard to track down a list of the democratic governments the US tried to overthrow, should it?

I asked for a source listing the 50+ democratic governments. Fact is that the US helped overthrow two, and neither of which was exactly a model democracy. I'd be surprised of the US tried to overthrow more than two dozen governments of any variety since the end of WWII.
 
 
maybe he should have said: interfered in the domestic politics of 50 + countries? for which i believe he gave a link to already

OK, could someone please extract - for the benefit of those of us who don't have the time or bandwidth to wait for massive YouTube videos to load - the list of these 50 countries and post it?
 
 
This is the list that i have been able to get together so far. It only includes coups and not assinations or assination attempet by the CIA.

Iran - 1953 - The CIA orchestrated the overthrow of
democratically elected Mossadegh and restored the Shah
to power.

Guatemala - 1954 - The CIA overthrew the
democratically elected Arbenz and placed Colonel Armas
in power.

Vietnam - 1950s-75 - Vietnam War.

Congo - 1960 - President Eisenhower ordered the assassination of the country's first prime minister in 1960. CIA chief Allen Dulles sent a CIA scientist to Congo with a lethal virus. But before the plan could be activated, Lumumba was deposed. He was later captured with CIA help and killed by rebel forces.

Cuba - 1961 - The CIA-directed Bay of Pigs invasions
failed to overthrow the Castro government.

1968: Coup in Panama by CIA backed Omar Torrijos.

Laos – 1960s – In 1962, CIA agents recruited Meo tribesmen living in the mountains of Laos to fight as guerrillas against Communist Pathet Lao forces.

British Guiana/Guyana, 1953-64: For 11 years, two of the oldest democracies in the world, Great Britain and the United States, went to great lengths to prevent a democratically elected leader from occupying his office. Cheddi Jagan was another Third World leader who tried to remain neutral and independent. He was elected three times. Although a leftist-more so than Sukarno or Arbenz-his policies in office were not revolutionary. But he was still a marked man, for he represented Washington's greatest fear: building a society that might be a successful example of an alternative to the capitalist model. Using a wide variety of tactics-from general strikes and disinformation to terrorism and British legalisms, the U. S. and Britain finally forced Jagan out in 1964. John F. Kennedy had given a direct order for his ouster, as, presumably, had Eisenhower

Brazil – 1961-64 - President Joao Goulart overthrown in a USA backed Coup

Indonesia - 1965 - The CIA orchestrated a military
coup.

Dominican Rep- 1963-66 – In February 1963, Juan Bosch took office as the first democratically elected president of the Dominican Republic since 1924. Here at last was John F. Kennedy's liberal anti-Communist, to counter the charge that the U.S. supported only military dictatorships. Bosch's government was to be the long sought " showcase of democracy " that would put the lie to Fidel Castro. He was given the grand treatment in Washington shortly before he took office.
Bosch was true to his beliefs. He called for land reform, low-rent housing, modest nationalization of business, and foreign investment provided it was not excessively exploitative of the country and other policies making up the program of any liberal Third World leader serious about social change. He was likewise serious about civil liberties: Communists, or those labeled as such, were not to be persecuted unless they actually violated the law.
A number of American officials and congresspeople expressed their discomfort with Bosch's plans, as well as his stance of independence from the United States. Land reform and nationalization are always touchy issues in Washington, the stuff that "creeping socialism" is made of. In several quarters of the U.S. press Bosch was red-baited.
In September, the military boots marched. Bosch was out. The United States, which could discourage a military coup in Latin America with a frown, did nothing.
Nineteen months later, a revolt broke out which promised to put the exiled Bosch back into power. The United States sent 23,000 troops to help crush it.

Greece, 1964-74: The military coup took place in April 1967, just two days before the campaign for j national elections was to begin, elections which appeared certain to bring the veteran liberal leader George Papandreou back as prime minister. Papandreou had been elected in February 1964 with the only outright majority in the history of modern Greek elections. The successful machinations to unseat him had begun immediately, a joint effort of the Royal Court, the Greek military, and the American military and CIA stationed in Greece. The 1967 coup was followed immediately by the traditional martial law, censorship, arrests, beatings, torture, and killings, the victims totaling some 8,000 in the first month. This was accompanied by the equally traditional declaration that this was all being done to save the nation from a "Communist takeover." Corrupting and subversive influences in Greek life were to be removed. Among these were miniskirts, long hair, and foreign newspapers; church attendance for the young would be compulsory.

1968: Coup in Iraq backed by the CIA re-establishes rule of the Ba'ath Party and bring Saddam Hussein to the threshold of power.

Cambodia - 1970 – For over 15 years, the CIA had tried various unsuccessful means of deposing Cambodia's left-leaning Prince Norodom Sihanouk, including assassination attempts. However, in March, 1970, a CIA-backed coup finally did the job. Funded by US tax dollars, armed with US weapons, and trained by American Green Berets, anti-Sihanouk forces called Kampuchea Khmer Krom (KKK) overran the capital of Phnom Penh and took control of the government. With the blessing of the CIA and the Nixon administration, control of Cambodia was placed in the hands of Lon Nol, who would later distinguish himself by dispatching soldiers to butcher tens of thousands of civilians.

1970s – Kurd Rebels - During the early 1970s the CIA moved into eastern Iraq to organize and supply the Kurds of that area, who were rebelling against the pro-Soviet Iraqi government. The real purpose behind this action was to help the shah of Iran settle a border dispute with Iraq favourably. After an Iranian-Iraq settlement was reached, the CIA withdrew its support from the Kurds, who were then crushed by the Iraqi Army.

Chile - 1973 (9/11/1973)- The CIA orchestrated a coup, killing
President Allende who had been popularly elected. The
CIA helped to establish a military regime under
General Pinochet.

East Timor, 1975 to 1999:
In December 1975, Indonesia invaded East Timor, which had proclaimed its independence after Portugal had relinquished control of it. The invasion was launched the day after U. S. President Gerald Ford and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger had left Indonesia after giving Suharto permission to use American arms, which, under U.S. Iaw, could not be used for aggression. Indonesia was Washington's most valuable tool in Southeast Asia.
Amnesty International estimated that by 1989, Indonesian troops, with the aim of forcibly annexing East Timor, had killed 200,000 people out of a population of between 600,000 and 700,000. The United States consistently supported Indonesia's claim to East Timor (unlike the UN and the EU), and downplayed the slaughter, at the same time supplying Indonesia with all the military hardware and training it needed to carry out the job.

Angola - 1976-92 - The CIA backed South African rebels
fighting against Marxist Angola.

1976: Military coup in Argentina leads to the Proceso de Reorganización Nacional. With the support of United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, the junta continued the Dirty War, the ongoing disappearance, torture, and murder of thousands of suspected political dissidents and leftists during the junta's rule.

Afghanistan, 1979-92:
During the late 1970s and most of the 1980s, Afghanistan had a government committed to bringing the incredibly backward nation into the 20th century, including giving women equal rights. The United States poured billions of dollars into waging war against this government, simply because it was supported by the Soviet Union. Prior to this, CIA operations had knowingly increased the probability of a Soviet intervention, which is what occurred. In the end, the United States won, and the women, and the rest of Afghanistan, lost. More than a million dead, three million disabled, five million refugees, in total about half the population.

Nicaragua - 1981-90 - On November 23, 1981, President Ronald Reagan signed a top secret National Security Directive authorising the CIA to spend $19 million to recruit and support the Contras, opponents of Nicaragua's Sandinista government. In supporting the Contras, the CIA carried out several acts of sabotage without the Congressional intelligence committees giving consent - or even being informed beforehand. In response, Congress passed the Boland Amendment, prohibiting the CIA from providing aid to the Contras. Attempts to find alternate sources of funds led to the Iran-Contra scandal. It may also have led the CIA and the Contras to become actively involved in drug smuggling. In 1988, the Senate Subcommittee on Narcotics, Terrorism, and International Operations concluded that individuals in the Contra movement engaged in drug trafficking; that known drug traffickers provided assistance to the Contras; and that 'there are some serious questions as to whether or not US officials involved in Central America failed to address the drug issue for fear of jeopardizing the war effort against Nicaragua'.

Grenada - 1983-84 - American invasion overthrew the
Maurice Bishop government.

Haiti – 1988 - The CIA attempted to intervene in Haiti's elections with a 'covert action program' to undermine the campaign of the eventual winner, Jean-Bertrand Aristide.

Panama - 1989-90 - 27,000 Americans landed in
overthrow of President Noriega; over 2,000 Panama
civilians were killed.

Haiti – 1991 – Aristide overthrown in a bloody coup that killed more than 4,000 civilians. Many of the leaders of the coup had been on the CIA payroll since the mid-1980s. For example, Emmanuel 'Toto' Constant, the head of FRAPH, a brutal gang of thugs known for murder, torture, and beatings, admitted to being a paid agent of the CIA.

Haiti – 1994 - An American force of 20,000 was sent to Haiti to allow Aristide to return. Ironically, even after this, the CIA continued working with FRAPH and the NIS.

Venezuala - 2002 -On April 11, 2002, Venezuelan military leaders attempted to overthrow the country's democratically-elected left-wing president, Hugo Chavez. The coup collapsed after two days as hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets and as units of the military joined with the protestors. The administration of George W. Bush was the only democracy in the Western Hemisphere not to condemn the coup attempt. According to intelligence analyst Wayne Madsen, the CIA had actively organised the coup: 'The CIA provided Special Operations Group personnel, headed by a lieutenant colonel on loan from the US Special Operations Command at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, to help organise the coup against Chavez

Haiti – 2004 - Aristide was overthrown once again, with Aristide claiming that US forces had kidnapped him.

Considering that virtually none of the countries involved were democracies. Perhaps I should post a list of Soviet interventions. I do love it how any coup that the US supports is automatically a US-sponsored coup. So if I want to see Chavez dead, and someone kills him, I'm responsible for his death?

Genocide and internal repression are vastly different things. International Law is tentatively beginning to acknowledge a right, or even duty to intervene to halt genocide - it doesn't accept a right to intervene against the internal behaviour of states.

So you think it is morally right to prevent murder if it is conducted on ethnic grounds, but otherwise murder is ok? I don't understand this schitzophrenic view or why it is touted as being some sort of superior system of morality, as it often is in our society - is it really so hard to say that you do not support murder under any circumstances, no matter whether the murderer wants to kill someone for Reason A or Reason B, or whether he is a common thug off the street or a polite man in a smart suit with his own flag? I agree that there is no moral duty to put yourself in life-threatening danger to come to the help of others, but I do not accept that criminals have a moral right to defence against attempts to stop them killing, maiming or robbing peaceable citizens. That is a position as irrational as it is repugnant.

I wasn't talking about morality - I was talking about International Law.

If you're going to take the position that intervention is valid for any actions considered to be 'morally wrong', would you support the EU 'intervening' in the USA because the US still executes people or locks people up without trial? How about the US intervening in the Netherlands because they allow gay marriage?

The illegality of genocide, slavery, piracy and (maybe) aggressive war, are called jus cogens or peremptory norms. They are, essentially, the evolving 'morality' of states.

Now, I'm not saying I don't support some interventions - but it depends by whom and for what reasons. And the US isn't exactly the most successful intervener around.

Hitler's invasion of other states was a violation of national soveriegnty, completely different from the internal violations of the sovereignty of the people you mentioned earlier on. In the first case, reaction by other states is legitimate. In the second, the lines are blurred.
I would add: what moral right does the US or the UK have over others just because they think they have the key to paradise on earth, namely their version of democracy (and of course they have the troops to enforce them)? Now leave me out of your black and white world, I am not supporting Hussein or anyone one of those worms. I simply abhor the cultural arrogance that makes people think that they have a right to impose a way of life on others because they think it is better for them and for everyone. And yes, the USSR did the same. But that ended 17 years ago. You would think thing had evolved since then, but no, we ended up with neo-cons.

It seemed to work with Nazi Germany, Japan, Etc. Of course civilian casualties should be kept to a minimum, but given how bloodthirsty Saddam's regime was, I think it would be difficult to argue that deaths due to accidents Etc. on the coalition's part outweigh the death Saddam and his successors would have dealt if they were allowed to remain in power.

Fair enough. I agree with you that international law represents very backward morality, presumably because it needs the signatures of the dictators themselves in order to take effect, which is why outside intervention is necessary in the first place.

Executing people for severe crimes after a fair trial is not clearly immoral, so no. It is a matter of conscience that should be left to individual judiciaries or legislatures.

As I understand it, Guantanimo Bay contains irregular combatants captured in the field, who are neither civil criminals nor entitled to prisoner of war status. It is another grey area, but at most it justifies an invasion of Guantanimo Bay, not the mainland United States, in which Guantanimo Bay is illegal.

Do people really believe this rubbish? The soldiers who stormed the Nazi concentration camps didnt come from Germany, yet I doubt you'd argue that this made storming them an immoral act, and that we should have left them there until some Germans came along to do it. That's just plain silly. Morality is either universal, or it does not exist at all.

The EU though clearly believes that to execute anybody for anything is immoral - hence why we won't extradite people to countries that employ the death penalty. If the EU states believed it was a matter for individual legislatures, they a) wouldn't have signed a convention abolishing it across all EU territory and b) would still extradite people to states that execute people.

So if you're going to argue that state A should intervene in state B because it believes it's doing something immoral, you should advocate the EU having a right to intervene in the US, and what's more, you should advocate Iran having a right to intervene in Iraq, Israel, the USA, or indeed anywhere were Islamic law isn't in effect. I dare say you don't?

The EU does not ban the death penalty, the unrelated European Declaration on Human Rights does. The EDHR is an intergovernmental treaty, not a government. It is simply a statement of intent by numerous legislatures to remove the death penalty within their own borders. States do not have to allow their citizens to be extradited, so that's irrelevent.

 
So if you're going to argue that state A should intervene in state B because it believes it's doing something immoral, you should advocate the EU having a right to intervene in the US, and what's more, you should advocate Iran having a right to intervene in Iraq, Israel, the USA, or indeed anywhere were Islamic law isn't in effect. I dare say you don't?
 

You seem to think I am a moral relativist. I am not. I have a clear and absolute view of morality, and it does not state that harmless "religion crimes" are immoral, or that the death penalty is necessarily a disproportionate punishment. If I were a moral relativist then yes, you are right, I should believe that interventionism is never acceptable to stop people from acting in a manner they believe is right, even if that involves murder, assault or theft. However this assumption is baseless and wrong.

No doubt the US forces would beat the small forces Caracas has, but they'd not be able to hold the nation to there whims, or go for a ground invasion....needed to really beat a nation.

The Venezuelan people, like any people occupied by a foreign power, will fight for there right to be free. If El Presidente died, he's become a Hero, and galvanize the masses in opposition to the US.

Uh...twisted. Your reply has nothing to do with my point. Once again, your example is false, because Nazi war camps:
i) contributed to Nazi Germany's war effort
ii) were more often than not situated in the territory of other sovereign states that Nazi Germany had conquered
iii)were detaining nationals of other countries which were not citizens of Nazi Germany
I am no lawyer, but I am pretty sure international law and simple military necessity apply in this case, not the morals of the soldiers or the commanders(who only had a faint idea of what was really going on in there).

You must look at the reasons why the camps were stormed, not the overall moral "meaning" behind it. I meant that supposedly democratic nations should not think that they have an axiomatic "moral" right to determine what happens to an entire population situated in one sovereign state. Basing a declaration of war to rid the world of a dictator is entirely subjective (although I also believe he is one) and does not, in my eyes, make sense. The war happened, that is behind us now. I am not discussing whether it should have happened or not, but just regretting the fact that some people believe they have the MORAL RIGHT to do blast a nation back to the stone age because the think it is just.
Whether the result of the Iraq is good or bad because a dictator is gone I won't discuss. I am just examining the grounds on which Iraq was invaded (vested interests, "very moral" indeed, should also be borne in mind). And the whole thing simply does not hold together. We have international law, and that should call the shots.
As to your views on morality, I would rather not discuss

Some of them did. Others, that did not employ slave labour, detracted from it. Should we have left these and only liberated the ones of military importance?

 
ii) were more often than not situated in the territory of other sovereign states that Nazi Germany had conquered
 

Again, should we have left the German ones? What about camps in Poland that were liberated by the Soviets? Was this immoral? Should the Soviets have left them until some Poles could come along and liberate it?

 
iii)were detaining nationals of other countries which were not citizens of Nazi Germany
 

So if a camp contained no non-German nationals, it would have been immoral to storm it?

I've stopped here because the rest of your post is based on the same reasoning that produced that, and it really is not necessary to dissect it further. Your morality is insane. Based on the arguments you presented in defence of murder not being universally immoral (for that is what you did), you seem to think that people are the property of national groups, the leaders of which (however appointed) hold absolute power over them, and can dispose of them however they wish. If you really cannot see anything wrong with this then there is nothing I can say or do to change your mind.

This is a completely useless discussion as the UK declared war on Germany for reasons that had nothing to do with the camps.
 
 
That's completely irrelevent. Regardless of the wider causes of the war, most people believe that liberating the concentration camps was a moral act. Ulv! is arguing that, provided they dont benefit the Nazi war effort, arent located outside Nazi territory or contain non-Nazi subjects, liberating concentration camps is an im moral act.

You're assuming that doing something more immoral to stop something immoral happening is somehow right.

Now, that's not the case with the NS-genocide, but then again, Godwin's law quite reasonably states that as soon as somebody brings up the Nazi's, decent discussion is likely to be over (and that that person lost the argument, but hey...).

Sure, I wouldnt advocate killing hundreds of innocent people in order to save one, but that isnt what Ulv! is arguing against - he is saying that stopping criminal activity by governments from without is generally immoral because it violates supposed "national sovereignty".

 
but then again, Godwin's law quite reasonably states that as soon as somebody brings up the Nazi's, decent discussion is likely to be over (and that that person lost the argument, but hey...).
 

Only if the debate is between stupid people who cannot separate themselves from their arguments. No one here seems to be having that problem (one of the things I like about the D&D boards on this forum), so I don't see why examples related to Nazi Germany should be any less valid than other examples.
 
 
Collingwood, that is certainly not what I wanted to argue. Here it is, nice and simple:
i)Collingwood. BEFORE the camps were stormed, most Allied soldiers had no idea what they were going for. The 3 reasons I stated are just a few reasons why they would invade the camps. Knowing about the chambers was harder. If you like, we have objective reasons for invading, AND moral reasons (supposing they knew about what was going on). Supposing they did not know, moral did not enter the game.Thus we have the premises of the storming of the camp. This took place during a total war (Iraq was invaded ON moral grounds). Now all these suppositions are making this discussion pretty insipid, sorry guys, but I would like to tell Collingwood what I meant.
ii)Ultimately, the storming of the camps was a good act. Of course. I am simply distinguishing the overall value of the act and what pushed the unknowing Allies to do it.How can you suggest that I consider it to be an immoral act to storm the camps? I think that you are going way too far. I understand that the internet is not the easiest place to state things clearly, but I am amazed at how you are twisting things. So apparently I support murder, inhumanity and totalitarian practices...let me tell you something. My French grandfather was a member of the Communist Resistance; my Austrian grandfather an infantry soldier in the Wehrmacht. I have given this period of the history of my continent (and my family ) much thought my friend. And before you take your devious debating tricks any further, I suggest you stop right there. Your way of arguing is dishonest, since you do not follow the logic of a statement (although it is possible that I exposed this logic badly), you deform statements and jump to conclusions in order to formulate a sensationalist journalistic (tabloid standards) response.
I don't like getting personal like this, but you clearly made a personal statement.
Now how we got from Iraq to here, I don't know. Maybe you should have focused your polemic skills on that subject. I won't take this discussion any further.

That's not morality in any sense.

 
We have international law, and that should call the shots.
 

And the invasion of Iraq was justified in terms of international law.

This isn't relevant to what I was saying. I'm not trying to second guess the intentions of the people who stormed the camps. What those men were thinking at the time is irrelevent. What is relevant is that, now, we view storming the concentration camps as a very moral thing to do. In other words, regardless of whether or not we did it or why, we think it was a just thing to do. You said, and I quote:

 
Originally Posted by Ulv!

So, my question to you is: how can you square your belief in the morality of storming the concentration camps by foreign (ie. non-German) troops with your demand that only members of the same national group can defend nationals from injustice? Sure, there may have been amoral reasons for storming the concentration camps too, but that's only a valid counter argument is you accept that it would be immoral to storm a similar concentration camp without these amoral considerations, which you just said you don't.

 
So apparently I support murder, inhumanity and totalitarian practices...let me tell you something.

All I did was take your statements to their logical conclusions. I am not suggesting you are a Nazi, or support concentration camps, or whathaveyou - obviously you don't - I am suggesting that you do not actually believe what you claim to believe, when you think it through logically.

 
Now how we got from Iraq to here, I don't know. Maybe you should have focused your polemic skills on that subject. I won't take this discussion any further.
 

We got from Iraq to here because you said that we don't have a moral right to enforce justice on foreign tyrannies, and this is an excellent example of where almost everyone (including you, it seems, which does not surprise me - I have never implied you support these acts) believes it was moral to enforce justice on a "sovereign state".

Objectively, yes. But when there's no preferable solution immediately available, sometimes you have to put up with one.

For example. Hypothetically speaking, suddenly getting rid of Saddam Hussein would instantly plunge Iraq into a maelstrom of sectarian violence and create a terrorists' breeding ground reminiscent of a termite mound. Clearly this is not in anyone's interests except the those of the terrorists themselves, so nobody is actually going to do it.

Oh, wait.

The same applies to Musharraf, with the difference that his position is safe from external interference; the threats he faces come from within.

And amazingly enough, both were able to kill as many as they did because they gave themselves complete control of the economy. The type of mass murder carried out by Hitler, Stalin, and Mao are only possible in command economies. As long as the means of production are in private hands, the government will find it incredibly difficult to kill a truly massive amount of people (which is usually done through forced starvation).

Yes - I could do with some actual evidence that a democratically elected Marxist government in Chile, such as Allende's, was actually leading the country on the path to ruin, not some fatuous list of overwhelmingly non-democratic Stalinist countries.

Can you back that up with some sources please? I'm slightly skeptical over Chile's socialist government killing 'hundreds of thousands'.

And I find it slightly ironical that you're using potential deaths to justify the ascent of someone to power to caused actual deaths.

Erm, you expect him to provide sources for potential deaths?  

As for what you consider 'ironical' - of course potential death is going to be considered in terms of justifying the morality of an action, well, at least if you're a consequentialist. Which it appears is what is being accepted here.

well i would prefer a democratically elected leader setting out what they belive to be in their peoples best interest, instead of an american backed facist any day. look at modern day chili built on the back of pinochet and you see a country of rich people....but when you look a little closer past the blood stained streets and stadia you notice thousands locked out of the economy living in abject poverty, and a nation stripped of its national assets by transnationals. yep i would prefer to live with a nation goverened for its people not the people of the USA.

Chile 1970's - establishes Pinochet over demo-elected Allende. Why? Allende began to nationalise industry.
More more more

Please provide a list of said governments. This should be fun.

Look at the last 70 years of every Latin American country bar Colombia. Look further afield to the Middle East (Iran in the 70's, Iraq now).. Downto Southern Africa from the 40's onwards (Angola, Namibia, Mozambique - all to protect apartheid regime). Swing up to Vietnam, Cambodia. Undermining of communist government in Laos. Funding Indonesia's assault on East Timor. It goes on man, I can't believe you're even asking this question.

So US trying to influence elections in Latin America 3 decades ago is bad, but Chavez doing the exact same thing right now is good? I love it how the blatant hypocrisy doesn't bother you.

 

US funded military groups (see first point) to bring down governemnts and sedate the population against an uprising. Tried the same with Chavez but Venezuelans brought him back. Oh, and voted for him a second time. Chavez's tactic is much more benign (e.g., paying off Argentina's IMF debt; offering oil for doctors with Cuba; negotiating hostage release in Colombia).

etc etc.
 
 
Bismarck, I find it very interesting (and slightly disturbing) that someone of your intelligence would post messages in favor of Pinochet. The man was a monster and a loon, saying he was better than a government that never even had a shot is a very flawed argument.

Assuming that Allende would be different that every other socialist government in the third world is intellectually dishonest.

The US never funded the members of the Venezuelan military who tried to bring down Chavez. And I don't consider openly supporting populist dictator-wannabes and encouraging civil unrest to be benign. You should ask the Ecuadorans how benign Chavez' support was.

"dictator-wannabes"? either a dictator or not, no?

And in what way is Correa a dictator? You can't label someone as a dictator purely because you don't agree with their politics - straight from the Bush school of propaganda. Correa is comparatively more moderate (even for those who were looking for a Chavez-style 'radicalism' and are now disappointed) so perhaps you've chosen the wrong example.

And, yep, I think you really lost all credibility when favouring Pinochet over Allende.

Well, the post sounded like he was pretty certain about the deaths of hundreds and thousands that would have occurred if Pinochet didn't take power. Maybe 'sources' is the wrong word to use, but I'm interested in seeing the facts that point to this conclusion. (As in, I'm honestly interested in seeing them - I'd appreciate a different point of view).

and I didn't find it ironic that potential deaths were being used as justification, I found it ironic that the ruler who's ascent was being justified was one who did kill people. If that makes sense.

Iraq was at its most prosperous under Saddam. But then again he cut ties with Washington so they got rid of him.
So, lucky for Pinochet - who governed similarly to Saddam - that allowed the US access to Chilean markets, otherwise the same fate would've befallen him.

The 'hypocisy', Bismarck, is that US foreign policy has never been about the internal situation within the target country, but instead it's ability to let the US into its markets (as proven above). So when Bush talks about settling the internal situation, grab and handful of salt. Read the same for US aid...

As for socialist governments not being able to hold a steady economy, few have been given the chance to develop an economy under a socialist structure because it is sabotaged before it is allowed to strengthen. How can you predict that it won't work based on past evidence when this evidence is grossly tainted by US meddling? unless, of course, you condone the US destabilising an economy?

Ah, so dismissing elected senators and then dismissing the supreme court when it overturns your decision are not the acts of a dictator.

Of course this is in no part due to the india-pakistani wars, the various droughts of the 60s and 70s, the withdrawal of aid by the US, the mess left by the British colonialism and the problems industrialising an agrarian society into one which can compete with the free market demanded by the west.

No, not at all. Totally socialism's fault.  

In any case I'd still prefer a Indian style socialism over Pinochet any day.
 
 
So Bismark - do you value capitalism or anti-socialism over civil liberties?

You mean there were no droughts in the 2 decades since India adopted more capitalist policies?   And there were no conflicts with Pakistan?   Odd how India only started to achieve solid economic growth once it adopted market policies.

Actually
1)the only significant drought India has had after the 80s was around the turn of the millenium. And it was by no means as bad as the consecutive ones from 65 to 72.
2)Three all out wars with pakistan - 47, 65 and 71 - (not to mention a war with China) compared with a conflict in '99 where bearly a thousand people were killed? No there weren't any wars with the same effect on India since the 80s.

In short India's gone had a relatively trouble free era and the current more liberal (but still a mixed economy) has inherited an India with most of its Independence kinks ironed out by the more socialist government prior.

There was plenty of political liberty under Nehru and his successors. Indira Gandhi's emergency in the 1970s was the exception rather than the rule.

I'd have political liberty over economic liberty if I had to choose any day of the week.

Like I said, India was far too poor to implement a proper socialist economic system. African countries were even poorer and thus even less able to implement socialist policies.

Because controlling the economy gives you de facto control over the political process.

So your earlier point re: India being a socialist dictatorship is essentially void, then.

So all you're left with is a bunch of undemocratic stalinist nations, none of which are like Allende-ist Chile.

I think it would be fair to expect something similar to Yugoslavia or Romania (under Ceausescu). India was meant to show that even countries that started to implement a socialist system destroyed the livelihood of their people.

People were dying (in far greater numbers) under the British Empire, and they were far from socialist. I can't see where you're going with this argument, because it isn't working, for India at least.

How isn't it working? How many people died due to India's socialist policies? I'm willing to bet the number is in the tens of millions. All you have to do is compare the life expectancy and the infant mortality rate in socialist India and in capitalist India. So let's compare the figures from 1975 with ones from 2000.

Stat - 1975, 2000

Life expectancy - 50, 63
Infant mortality - 127 (per 1000), 62 (per 1000)

Let's also see how Pinochet harmed the poor Chileans:

Life expectancy - 63, 78
Infant mortality - 78, 8
GDP growth - 4.1% per year (from 1975 to 1990), 3.7% per year (from 1990 to 2004); this is despite Western economies doing far better in the latter period

Now that sounds like a familiar tatic of facists as i seem to remeber the Nazis doing something similar.

The fact is looking at a nations GDP percapita as a measure of its well being is thinking that went out with the 70s and 80s. The wolrd has moved on to using more representative data that gives a real picture such as the HDI. Perhaps you ought to try and learn about development before you shout your mouth off.

Godwin, you lose. And yes, it's totally accurate to equate someone killing 3,000 people and someone killing tens of millions.   You know how many people your buddy Castro killed? Castro himself admitted to killing 6,000 by 1963, with the total number being somewhere between 20k and 100k.

If you actually used your brain for once, which is admittedly hard, you'd know I got those stats from the UN HDI website.   Coincidentally, Chile's HDI went up from.706 to.787 under Pinochet. And if you knew what the HDI actually was, you'd know that the two stats I used (GDP growth and life expectancy) are two of the four indicators used to calculate it.

Erm, there is only one natural economic system. Anything other than capitalism is simply artificial. What you're saying is that countries should enact some artificial policies but not others. I still fail to see how India would be any less democratic if it was capitalist from the beginning.

How can any economic system be defined as natural? Unless you have developed a definitive diagnosis of the human condition you cannot claim that captalism is the 'natural' economic system. Yes, I agree it is by far the most successful, but you cannot say that that is because it is the most 'natural'.
 
 
Capitalism simply means, in practise, 'self ownership' - in other words, capitalism is what people do if you dont coerce them into doing anything else. This can result in any economic system, theoretically, even voluntary communism. The fact that it never does says something about human nature but ultimately it is irrelevent - if everyone consented to being arbitrarily killed and having their property stolen, capitalism could result in the Soviet Union. It is, by definition, the natural system.

Because if there is no government, you'll end up with capitalism. Things like supply and demand are no different to laws of nature. You might try to subvert them (and pay an extreme cost for doing so), but they always exist. Socialism has to be created. Fascism has to be created. Capitalism does not.

Chavez himself said:

Cuckoo is a synonym for Chavez's "crazy" that is also a pun on the type of clock. Aside from this pun, which has no political significance, it is just a paraphrasing of Chavez's own words. What is wrong with this?
 
 
There's a difference between 'I don't care if they call me crazy' and replacing it with 'Call me Cuckoo'. Aside from the creative quoting, cuckoo is a far more emotive word than crazy. Also, whilst the headline in itself means very little, it implies a bias that may be less obvious in the story proper.

I think you're going a bit far. If he said "call me crazy" and the headline reads "call me cuckoo" then that is not obvious bias. It is using another word for crazy to make a pun.
 
 
Personally, Since he won the last election, i havent really been impressed by Chavez. I hope the reforms he wants to make to the constitution get voted down and i wouldnt care too much if he lost the next election as long as the opposition dont win.

But Bismarks almost sexual attraction to labelling Chavez a dictator is just laughable. Hes changing the time, wow, worst things have been done by Chavez himself.
 
 
And by the way, he announced this daytime saving experiment about a month and a half ago.

Labelling any democratically elected leader a Dictator is laughable.

Most Western leader act anti-democratically on many issues. Are they dictators too ?

So is it your claim that any leader who gets elected democratically cannot at some future point become a dictator?

 

You claimed that being a dictator meant acting in a "anti-democratic fashion". Despite huge opposition to the Iraq War Bush still isn't making the change in direction the majority of voters want. These "anti-democratic" actions would therefore, by your definition, mean Bush is a dictator.

And no.

Jesus, the lack of real knowledge about the political situation in Venezuela just reeks in that post.

1. There is no opposition in parliament because the OPPOSITION decided to boycott the elections, go ask them why.

2.Coerced? How so?

3. If you can give me a credible account of government workers being fired due to that reason, i'll stand corrected.

4. Like Bush?

5. President for life? hahah you really dont like this guy do you. You do realise he has to win elections to be president for life. How many times was Roosevelt elected in America?

Seriously, read some books Bismark. The Economist just isnt enough to have a well informed opinion on Chavez.
 
 
bismarck,

the 'brown' people in Latin America i assume you're talking about are the Spanish conquistadors, no? who destroyed the rights and lives of the indigenous when they arrived. and who now are the demographic at the bottom of the social ladder in many, if not all, LA countries...?

so a supporter of Chavez can hardly be gunned for standing by and watching the 'brown' people of Venezuela 'lose their rights' when all Chavez is doing is lifting the indigenous out of the quagmire, perhaps at the expense of bringing the colonial elite down a notch or two.

which is fine by me...

And there is a post of someone whose totally lost an arguement.

Doesnt address the points of my post but instead, calls me a racist.

Will you apologise for claiming Chavez drove out the opposition from parliament, when in fact they boycotted the elections?

Your woeful mis-information on this subject is shining through once again.
 
 
And the fact they boycotted the elections isn't evidence of corruption?

Hardly. It's evidence that they boycotted the elections. It's an indication they probably didn't think they'd win, which is a fair assessment - whatever you believe his faults to be, Chavez is clearly extremely popular.
 
 
yes but popularity does not give him absolute power.

And a party does not boycott an election just because they wont win. Otherwise the Liberal Democrats in the UK would never bother. Its done as a protest. They boycotted because of fears the election was rigged
 
 
Or they boycotted because they knew they wouldn't win, and were trying to undermine Chavez' legitimacy.
 
 
Whats this OR. Its a fact thats why they stood down, run a quick google search and you will find BBC pages on the subject.

And opposition partys dont stand down just becuase they wont win. They would have won SOME seats, they always do.

No, that's why they said they boycotted. And if you trust what politicans say, especially South American ones, you're more of a fool than I thought...

A fool? Thanks for that.

Anyway, moving on and keeping this sane, why would they pull out totally? Why would multiple parties make this choice?
Your argument makes no sense what so ever. "We wont get total power, so we wont even bother getting a share, Or even a say in how things work".

That's not how a democracy, or a political party works. Pulling out damages a part for YEARS. Why would they do that to themselves just because they were not going to win this election. Pulling out damages their chances of winning elections for decades.

find me a prominent group of indigenous opposition...

in fact, find me more than 10 indigenous politicians in parties that oppose Chavez.

yeh get back to me on that one

in what way did the oppostion represent indigenous opinion/rights in any way?
the sturcture of venez parliament means that only a small handful (3 ministers i think) represent indigenous people. and given that the stark idealogical contrast between opposition and incumbent generally means that one explicitly favours elite and the other a socialist stance, i'd be shocked if those 3 indigenous reps were anything to do with the oppostion.

also, what is this racism you're accusing everyone of? explain how my comment was even remotely racist.

finally, chavez isn't perfect by any means but if we're talking about pulling the lower classes up into society he's a unquestionalby more favourable than the past venez president and his neighbour in colombia.

A few points!
Is it shocking to find that the country with the 4th largest oil reserves on the planet has a petro based economy? I wuold call that playing to your strengths. Also at what point in the near future do you expect the price of oil to fall? And again i would point out how did multi national companies extracting the wealth from the oil fields previously help the poor of Venezula?

This made me laugh, does he really think that we would just let our navy be sunk by a load of crappy Russian and Iranian technology. I do hope the US carrier group shows up sometime soon to liberate the country and get ready of the socialist dictator.

 

Yeah you can just hope that your increasingly ****ty government or that ancient navy shows up and get READY of the democratically-elected dictator?
I mean what the.. you are talking about, I suppose you have been tried (i.e. buggered) by some scialiast that you are wishing them well with such passion.

Cool way to pick on spelling mistakes! Woooo

Being democratically elected does not exclude you from being a dictator.

that was never debated. it's whether your actions really constitute dictatorship. pinochet, uribe, samoza, fujimori - i'd call them dictatorships. they used violent repression and economic starvation to quell oppostion.

chavez, no. cancelling RCTV's licence - although not positive in my eyes - is far from dictatorial given they repeatedly called for the removal of a democratically elected, evidently popular, leader. his social programmes are showing signs of success, and taking a bit from the rich to give to the poor is the only way this world will balance itself. his move to keep oil state-owned is positive given his improvement of infrastructure (haven't got the same worries that exist in bolivia, for instance) and his intervention in colombia should really be seen as a progressive, not regressive, tactic.

He rules by decree. That's a dictatorship. I don't care if it's liberal or anything like that, I'm just stating facts.

I would like to point out at this point that the democratic Uganda government did a similar thing not too long ago and the world didn't bat an eyelid. Double standards anyone?
 
 
Chavez remains in power only as a result of indirect vote-buying by using oil money to subsidise goods sold by recently nationalised distributors, combined with a growing monopolisation of opinion as he takes over communications media and bans those that resist. I would not consider this man democratically elected anymore than someone who rigs an election in a less subtle manner. Of course, as a liberal, I dont think the government has a right to do almost any of the things Chavez is doing regardless of the process by which it has been appointed.

RCTV was not some great broadcater with non biased reporting instead it in its news it call for the overthrow of the government, said chaves was worse than Hitler etc. etc. can't imagine ITV or the BEEB doing something similar and getting away with it to be frank

So the current UK government...is that a democratically elected regime or would you say that they are equally guilty of vote-buying?

I don't believe that free speech should be banned regardless of how "impartial" it is, so no, I don't support British media regulators either. However the British media regulators do not simply ban anything that opposes the government. British newspapers, for instance, regularly do take sides in elections and are not banned as a result.

The UK does not subsidise goods sold by nationalised industries with nationalised oil money so I don't really understand what your point is here.
