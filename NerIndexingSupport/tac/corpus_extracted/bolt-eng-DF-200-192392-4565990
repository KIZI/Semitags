 
 
Is London overrated?
 
 
OK, I know southern people, especially middle class ones like to was lyrical about it, and there are areas I love. But seriously, as a city to live in full time, isn't it overrated? It has endless areas where I could not tell did I not know were any different, all being exactly the same in character(OK not including Bloomsbury, Docklands, Camden ad other distinct places) and is just endless to know well. It has a massive rich poor divide with the poor living right in the middle and the rich often quite far out, the opposuite of Paris, the city I think outstrips it completely in intrigue and beauty. The prices are huge for small accommodation, the places you go often don't give very personal service, as it's so hectic, it can be so congested it's impossible to feel an escape and when you do the park might be a **** one with bad stuff going down there. The tube works well but is miserable. And there are tons of things that you can do elsewhere, other places that are cosmopolitan etc, that don't make me buy the lifestyle argument, nowhere else is 'with it' etc.
I don't want a load of vitriol, I do find it impressive ins ome respects, I just get a little bored of it in every conversation down here, how nowhere else is worth being etc. I understand it's grandeur trumps other UK cities but to suggest that there can't be anything worth being part of or interesting other places irritates me.
So, are these people clued up or what? What is your view?
 
 
Compared to Seoul, yes.
 
 
.... Personally, I absolutely love London, The people, the accent, the multiculturalism, the excellent public transport system, the history, the fact that when in London one can NEVER be bored and short of something to do. What is not to love? I love going down to London and I wish that I could do so more often.

In a word: no.

I could go on and on about it, quote Dr Samuel Johnson at you ("when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life; for there is in London all that life can afford"), but London is just amazing. During my undergrad, I would get up in the morning and walk past Regent's Canal on my way to classes, if I wanted to go to the supermarket I'd see the City a mile away. It's just an amazing place to be in, living here is definitely not overrated or samey. The nightlife may be more expensive, but it's well worth it. I'm also a bit interested as to how you could describe Regent's Park or Hyde Park as "****"  

 
with the poor living right in the middle and the rich often quite far out
 

This is nonsense. The borough of Kensington and Chelsea is in central and you see ambassadors and the very rich, and a few roads down you're on the set of Kidulthood. Even London's suburbs are not all the same, Dagenham is nothing like Barnet for example. Most of London's central boroughs (Camden, Islington, Tower Hamlets, Westminster etc) have very nice areas, and not so nice areas. Such is the nature of urban living, this isn't exclusive to London.

London isn't perfect, for example public transport is quite expensive and fares rise each year, but I could never imagine living or studying anywhere else.

I hate that quote, it ****s me off. I didn't really mean Regents park or Hyde park, more the like so of Mile End park, London fields or whatever,not the nicest places to relax at times I'd imagine, and even those area would be dman hard for me to afford. Ie rich people in the middle, yes I get you, but it's very ghettoised, I suppose I wasn't clear, what I mean about Paris was middle class average people not rich in the middle, families milling about, it's relaxed, the really bad estates are on the outskirts, and in London you have this extreme wealth pushed up against the rough element in the middle, doesn't seem to be much in between, that's why it's not as nice to relax in. I love Bloomsbury, for example, but even that has it's element and isn't as nice to be in at night as Paris is. I don't know about nightlife, like I say I love Bloomsbury and Holborn, though the pubs are pricey as **** and probably the restaraunts. Was just saying that you can see bands, go to a club, differing restaraunts etc in other cities, loads of uni towns etc.
I never went out in Mile End when there, imagine that's entirely different.
There's places like highgate which Londoners love but I didn' think it was that good, pubs weren't friendly, bit miserable tbh. Hampstead is an example of the wealth divide thing, seems like you're either somewhere didgy or somewhere ridiculously posh and other worldly, too ghettoised. Just off the top of my head.
I do like East London tbh, it hasd a lot of charcacter more than Highgate Finchely etc which I thought was boring. but again, I dunno what the crime element is like. I studied there abit, but I can't imgain eliving there, if I wanted to live in Bloomsbury I'd have to be loaded. Whereas my friend on a modest middle class income has a flat right in central Paris, gorgeous area.

It really depends what you want and enjoy in a place you live. It is a little overrated compared to how some people describe it but it is still an amazing city though. And I have to disagree massively on Paris, it looks pretty and can be nice to visit but is just boring very quickly - if you could merge some of the feel of Paris with London that would be perfect.

Boring how so? I guyess it depends what you want, if you like 'caning it' then London, but maybe Paris you can do stuff other Europeans do more. At least it (was anyhow) more liveable and affordable, with nicer sunshine.
 
 
I have lived in London all my life and personally I hate it. More crime, 'chavs' and litter coupled with rude people always in a rush give it a thoroughly impersonal, unattractive feel.
 
 
No, I don't think so. Out of all the cities I've visited London is still my favourite, but it really depends on what you look for in a city.

I'm in Cambridge, don't get me wrong I get a buzz seeing it on the train and going down there. But it just has that impersonal thing, where Paris has a more intimate touch to it. It has more charm, for me.
 
 
 
Compared to Seoul, yes.

 

Hardly. Sorry, Whats your Banking Industry like?

Were an Alpha++ City, rivaled with New York.

Seoul is ranked Alpha...

We have world renowned Universities in London, such as UCL, LSE, Imperial etc.

I believe you have the "Sky" uni's which are no where near the prestige as our London Uni's.
 
 
so basically London is just a bunch of places to spend money and occasional things to look at that anyone actually living there would probably get bored of third time looking........... so what is actually good about London?
 
 
Yes. I live here, have done for most of my life, and I f***ing hate it. As soon as I turn 18 I am getting as far away from this hell hole as is possible.

This is completely wrong.
 
 
No.
 
 
i totally agree and in fact i was thinking of starting this same thread very recently

I understand that people will always disagre and we all like different things, so i'm not going to judge you if you disagree with me or if you like london. i just myself totally loathe it lol.

i was there for the umpteenth time just this week for a job interview. The minute you step off the train itt's like you're confronted by aa diffferent kind of human, and aggressive and angry form. there is no space. people are rude. if i smile at people, which is normal where i live, people get suspicious so i realise i need to adopt a hard nose attitude and stop smiling or people are gonna shank me. the prices are absurd. you need to earn about 40k a year to afford a one bedroom former council flat in the worst areas of it. the commute was horrible, got of at bank at 8am. actually thought i caught depression on that journey

Got off, saw the bank of england, the gherkin etc and whilst the user 'democracy', which i respect, obviously enjoys being around such famouss landmarks it didnt redeem the city for me.

maybe it's cos of where i am from. i come from south devon where i can drive to any of about 20 different beaches in 20 mins. or i can drive to a tor at the top of dartmoor and see the coast a whole 35 miles away on a clear day and just take the world in. oh and by drive i mean actually driving not being stuck in a jam. i've driven a lot in the south east, and you dont do any PROPER enjoyabke driving past reading! also, the people are courteous. if you drop a shopping bag you're bombarded with people fighting to hand it back to you! and it's not even that rural, north devon is, but in the south exeter actually has a lot of business. okay, there's no ''city of london'' but i personally wouldnt do that anyway. i want tto be an accountant, and we have that 5 minutes up the road. sure, i may earn 30k ijnstead of 50k, but here, as in most places outside london, i will live a better live on that here than i could on 100k in london (bigger house, moremoney for clothes). and that is a statisitcal fact. all round, that to me is a better quality of life....but i guess i mut be missing something because apparently it is better to live in london working 60 hour weeks and getting the tube in a concrete jungle and being scared to go out at night, paying your million pound 1 bedroom mortgage off for the rest of your life

anyway, like i said i respect we cant all agree. so no offence to londoners. but dont go thinking i just some prick who has only sseen it on telly, i've spent a LOT of time living in london. i know the score and im entitled to have an opinion on it....it's nott like i've only been there on the odd day trip. i KNOW i hate it  
 
 
I don't like London, it gives me this weird claustrophobic feeling when I'm there.

Maybe I'm just crazy though

I believe you have the "Sky" uni's which are no where near the prestige as our London Uni's.

 

economically, as you have pointed out, london is virtually globally unrivalled. in europe it IS unrivalled.

But for a lot of people that does not translate as ''great place to live''. its a matter off opinion. for me personally, that dosn't convince me to live there as i know having lived there, birmingham and devon that for me it's my least favourite. you like the place which is fine, we cant all agree.

it's jsut that people like you need to understand that not everyone cares about how many ftse 100s or unis they live near. it's not like we can't either commute and its not like our kids cant choose to move to london to go ucl or imperial if they wish! or in my case i can do the same graduate job i want elsewhere anyway 9and be better of financially too, 4k a year after bills and taxes etc, even though the salary in london for my job is almost double)

if i'd wanted to do the job in london i could, in fact i was asked if i wanted to switch to that office. i said no. if i wanted to i could be living and working there. but i dont. you have to respect that my criteria for what make s good place to live is different to yours, and indeed probably to the guy who liked seoul  
 
 
I hate London. I can see why people like it but I was there for two weeks on a placement and I was about to start throwing people who kept shoving me to get onto the tube one microsecond ahead of me Hulk style through the roof.
 
 
I was born and used to live in Croydon, and used to go into more central London a lot. It's a lot different today compared to 10 or 20 years ago though. I'd never want to live there today. There are far more "soul-ful" cities around the world.

I live in a suburb just south of Kuala Lumpur right now (well, for another 8 weeks till I move back to England  ... ) and I wouldn't want to live right in town over here either. Its something about getting out of the city to a place which is just so much calmer which appeals to me.

So is London overrated? It depends on who you are I guess. Some people just cannot live away from big cities. Perhaps no it's not for them (although there are far more interesting cities IMO). If you're like me, all cities are overrated, at least when you stop looking at them as places for day-visits and more as homes  .
 
 
Nah I think London is a brilliant city. I just get annoyed by the arrogant, inconsiderate people who act busy and seem to think their way of pronouncing 'bath' and 'water' is correct lol. I just wish more investment was made in the North of England.
 
 
In some respects; yes. I'm proud of it's history, it's position as one of, if not the most important cities in the world, it's financial power... But aside from that - it's a **** hole really, British people have a lack of respect that you rarely see elsewhere.

I HATE northerners who can't pronounce 'film' correctly - 'fil-m', sounds like filam  
 
 
one final thing, a lot of people who i have discussed this with refer to the ''money in london''. okay, i know that london has a 1% of very wealthy people (though it has the most relative poverty in england, to me almost every road even the ''nice '' areas look like absolute slums. hardly anyone has detached houses like in much of the country).

But, even the ridiculously expensive areas like knightsbridge and park land etc are not that good, okayy they cost like 20 million but all that shows is that some foreign billionaires need a place near the financial centre of europe. its a convenience thing. the areas are not even that great. the riich people i know in the south west and the midlands live in 40-50 room mansions with ACRES of land and, in devon, private beaches, outdoor pools etc. in london park lane you just get some, albeit extremely nice, townhouse which is often a terrace! tthey arent even that good, the areas! honestly, if i had that kind of money the last placei would live would be one of those! so im sorry, but thats an argument that doesnt win me over sorry. i'll take my mates house on the devon coast with a private beach, massive outdoor pool, annex over the cliff edge and 30 plus rooms and a golf cours thank you. and you cant gethat in park lane (underground stuff like what abramovich and ecclestone have doesnt count. ) the only rich people in london are the ones who ned to be there for their business, which is most of them....thats the reason theres money in london, not cos they choose to live there. trust me i know, cos about 50% of the population on south devon is retired londoners who couldnt wait to leave and get morre for their money the minute their business got soldd and they didnt need to be near the ''amazing banking industry'' anymore
 
 
 
I HATE northerners who can't pronounce 'film' correctly - 'fil-m', sounds like filam  

 

I pronounce it as film not filem  

I hate southerners who say aks instead of ask!
 
 
London in my absolute favourite place in the entire world, and I can't wait to spend the next four years studying there  
There are endless places to explore and see, and an equally endless amount of things to learn in that city. It is by far more interesting than any remote village in Devon. And I'll think you'll find that once you actually get to know people, they can be equally as nice and courteous.

remote villagesin devon are awful, worse than london  

what you want is to live on the south coast, around exeter and on the beach. its not remote there. probably not your thing if you're a confessed londonphile..but it is definitely not remote. in fact the best party scene i have known anywhere i lived and imo better than where i was in london, was in exmouth, bbqs on the beach all night everynight once the clubs kick you out, and its commutable to exxeter andd bristol (which has, with the exception of the stock market related jobs, has pretty much the same job market but with a better real wage )

just wanted to clariffy that the devon worth seeing is not the remote villagges. they are truly awful and i wouldnt want to thinking i would ever suggest them as a place to live. remember, devon is the second biggest countty in england, its diverse and has many different facades)

i enjoyed living in birmingham also
 
 
I don't mind living in London, but compared to most of the world's major cities I do think London is overrated. Most of the other major cities in the world are a lot more vibrant and interesting than London.
 
 
Nope.

London is amazing.
 
 
 
I don't mind living in London, but compared to most of the world's major cities I do think London is overrated. Most of the other major cities in the world are a lot more vibrant and interesting than London.

 

Which ones? Perhaps NYC compares, but I'd put London above NYC any day.
 
 
It is overrated compared to a lot of other cities in the world, imo.
 
 
I have lived in London all my life and at times can hate it but if I go anywhere else I get bored so easily and feel such relief to return. Maybe that's not because London is so great but because it's my home, though. I dunno. I don't think it is overrated but if you end up in some random largely residential suburb and don't know the 'haunts' (I mean the really good ones) then yeah I suppose you could come to that conclusion.
 
 
 
I don't mind living in London, but compared to most of the world's major cities I do think London is overrated. Most of the other major cities in the world are a lot more vibrant and interesting than London.

 

i came away from miami, madrid, barcelona, berlin, rome, paris, amsterdam, brussells, bruges, lisbon, sydney all feeling like i'd seen a truly pleasnt ''global'' city.

of all th global cities, london is the only one i havent absolutely fallen in love with. i've spent the most time there too

my fave is barcelona. best place i have ever visited
 
 
Depends what race you are.
 
 
 
Which ones? Perhaps NYC compares, but I'd put London above NYC any day.

 

Hong Kong, Shanghai, Barcelona, Madrid, Marseille, Nice, LA, Miami, Istanbul, etc. There's loads. I've never been to Australia but most Londoners who move there also say how Australian cities are superior to London, e.g. Sydney, Melbourne, Perth.

True.
 
 
Well, it's like any big city really: unfortunately Britain only has one properly large city so I suppose that makes people think that the downsides of city life are an exclusively London thing. And of course there are downsides, any many areas with some of the worst social problems in the UK, but the advantages of the place are obviously enormous.

I don't think I'd want to live there for my whole life. Then again, somewhere nice with a decent garden near the centre of Richmond or something I could just about cope with if I had a spare few million in my bank account! I don't like the lifestyle of many of my friends who've moved there though: living in rather drab places on the outskirts where the pubs are crap and the shops are awful, who simply commute into the centre every day on the Tube and end up having after-work drinks instead of a decent night out.

Although I live in Edinburgh, I'm fundamentally a country boy really. I like getting away from it all reasonable often. I suspect people raised in cities have a very different outlook.

In the World, it is only rivaled by New York. I agree, its nothing like the suburbs, villages and countryside. What makes London so great is its rich history, it's Economy, and it's nightlife.
 
 
 
Hong Kong, Shanghai, Barcelona, Madrid, Marseille, Nice, LA, Miami, Istanbul, etc. There's loads. I've never been to Australia but most Londoners who move there also say how Australian cities are superior to London, e.g. Sydney, Melbourne, Perth.

 

Lot's of cities are superior to London in some ways. You don't have to go abroad to find a cleaner city, for example. But when it comes to actually living somewhere - you seriously would take Istanbul, Hong Kong or anywhere in Spain over London?

None of those cities have the cultural variety and international nature of London. None of them are a major business hub like London is, none of them (except LA) have universities that can rival London's.

Sure, as a tourist you may think they are nicer in some ways, but I doubt you have any plans to move there do you?
 
 
New York is far better than London, closely followed by Berlin. I could easily live in either of those two cities ahead of London.
 
 
 
In some respects; yes. I'm proud of it's history, it's position as one of, if not the most important cities in the world, it's financial power... But aside from that - it's a **** hole really, British people have a lack of respect that you rarely see elsewhere.

 

Londoners do, it's not so bad out in the West country or North. But New Yorkers have all the bad manners of Londoners, in a stupid accent.

If you've got money living in Istanbul is a lot better than London, and it is an extremely beautiful city. And yes I could live in Hong Kong and Spain over London. Putting aside Spain's economy, it is still a nicer place to live. Hong Kong, LA and Miami are all very international cities, and btw many of the cities I listed are major business hubs, especially Hong Kong and recently Shanghai. As for universities, well that doesn't matter to me when deciding what is a more livable city - and anyway most of them do have universities that are comparable to London's (and often better!), but either way it doesn't matter to me.

I wouldn't mind living in some of the American cities I listed. In fact I've been thinking about moving to LA   I do have a Hong Kong ID card too. And well the other cities I couldn't move to them anyway as I don't speak their language. But I'm speaking generally, I can tell they are nicer to live in, even though it is impossible for me to live there due to language.

In my opinion, I think Hong Kong is even better than New York. It is an amazing city.
 
 
I hate London, It is one of the wealthiest places on earth yet it look slike one big third world jungle.
 
 
 
OK, I know southern people, especially middle class ones like to was lyrical about it, and there are areas I love. But seriously, as a city to live in full time, isn't it overrated? It has endless areas where I could not tell did I not know were any different, all being exactly the same in character(OK not including Bloomsbury, Docklands, Camden ad other distinct places) and is just endless to know well. It has a massive rich poor divide with the poor living right in the middle and the rich often quite far out, the opposuite of Paris, the city I think outstrips it completely in intrigue and beauty. The prices are huge for small accommodation, the places you go often don't give very personal service, as it's so hectic, it can be so congested it's impossible to feel an escape and when you do the park might be a **** one with bad stuff going down there. The tube works well but is miserable. And there are tons of things that you can do elsewhere, other places that are cosmopolitan etc, that don't make me buy the lifestyle argument, nowhere else is 'with it' etc.
I don't want a load of vitriol, I do find it impressive ins ome respects, I just get a little bored of it in every conversation down here, how nowhere else is worth being etc. I understand it's grandeur trumps other UK cities but to suggest that there can't be anything worth being part of or interesting other places irritates me.
So, are these people clued up or what? What is your view?

 

Comparing London with anywhere else in the UK is like comparing apples and oranges.

I love many parts of the North and pretty much every region of the UK has total splendour and wonderful people. But you can't possibly say whether or not a metropolitan area the size of a medium sized European country is 'better' or 'worse' than a much smaller city. The best night out I had all year was in York. York is clearly not better than London. It just happened like that because York is a really nice place to go out.

But whingeing about London is so massively old. It is the second most visited city in the world by foreign tourists and most visited by foreign business visitors. Given that foreigners don't give a flying cr*p about this country's pathetic north-south divide, that should tell you everything you need to know. i.e. London is not over-rated. The world travel and business market is not naive and ignores London-bashing. In terms of the size of its economy and the range of things to do there, London behaves and feels like a country, not a city. You can express a preference for or against that, obviously. But there is nowhere quite like it.
 
 
The thing is a room by a rough estate in a grim area costing 130 a week could also be described as a gem of a location within walking distance of the west end. Living in london is measured by commuting distance to the centre - I'd rather live at the above address than a room in a leisurely suburban area in zone 6 at the end of a tube line with a handful of bus routes within a 15min radius. I fail to see how central london is overrated. It has everything a city could offer. Plus it has its own distinctiveness and diverseity - bucks to topshop, belgravia to paddington, museum to club, south bank to st pauls.
 
 
 
Lot's of cities are superior to London in some ways. You don't have to go abroad to find a cleaner city, for example. But when it comes to actually living somewhere - you seriously would take Istanbul, Hong Kong or anywhere in Spain over London?

None of those cities have the cultural variety and international nature of London. None of them are a major business hub like London is, none of them (except LA) have universities that can rival London's.

Sure, as a tourist you may think they are nicer in some ways, but I doubt you have any plans to move there do you?

 

what difference do the good unis make? it's not as if your children can't attend them anyway. it's not the 1900s, people move around these days. you can live in paris and send your kids to ucl or lse.

as for the business hub, this is true. but once again, there are good jobs outside london and around the world too. and as i've said, i've secured one which is by choice not in the lond office (turned this down, as i don't like the city and i am also financially richer despite the much lower wage. found a flat with twice the square feet and i get to keep an extra 4 k a year in disposable on top of that, despite the wage being far less. it's called a real wage, and london eats them up unless you're in that tiny minority of the london population who work in the city)

so actually, i have made that choice. and in fact, i hope one day to live in barcelona as it happens. my kids can recieve educatin in a school where they aren't gonna get shanked and they'll learn a variety of languages, then all the money i will have saved on VAT, petrol, incredulously expensive british mortgages and over priced london living costs i spend on sending them to a british uni, in london if they so wish. oh and we'll be able to afford a pool too, because in barcelona that won't add about 3 million to the property price.  

not really sure how that's a bad deal. as for careers, i can speak some spanish, and the company i have an offer from does secondment to barca and madrid. so ur talkin **** and i guarentee i'll have a better quality of life there than if i lived in london (or anywhere in england to be fair)
 
 
Overrated and overpriced. Then again you can say the same to all the major cities in the world

How do you explain the VAST number of, say, French or Catalan young people that choose to live in London?

As the French media often moan, London is the 8th biggest French city. There are so many work-age, qualified French people living here that it is treated as some sort of disaster in the French press. The Australian government launched a federal commission into why so many young Australians don't come back from 'doing London' and just settle here instead.

I don't get why London should be a magnet to young, talented, well-qualified Europeans, North Americans and many others if it is not a very significantly desirable city in which to live and work.

It's the economics. London is unrivalled economically in europe. there are more good jobs there than anywhere else in the world arguably. that's why it attracts so many young ambitious people.

All i am saying, is that personally that doesn't convince me and i'd rather do the same job elsewhere and i'm better off financially anyway, plus i prefer the environment (as you have gathered, i don't really like london). however, obviously a lot of people are mainl interested in the economic benefits. it's a no brainer, but let's face it, they probably aren't going for the pristine beaches, palm trees, beautiful women or the weather are they   (to me, these are more important than earning an extra 10 grand a year just to have it eaten up by my mortgage on a tinier property than i could have in anywhere else in england, let alone the world.)
 
 
I've lived in London for the past 3 years and when I first moved, I hated it and couldn't wait to get out. I moved to Crawley (but still work in London) last month and now I really miss it. Really want to move back, there's just so much more to do and see.

I reckon it's simply because they want to improve their English. I used to play football with a lot of Spanish guys and they were all here just to improve their English, with the view to return to Spain once they were happy with it.
 
 
Born and raised in North London I can definitely say it was an amazing place to grow up in. But as an adult I'm bored to death of it, and can say I'm about 85% sure I don't want to live and raise a family here when I'm older.
 
 
London is cold, crowded and impersonal.

My kind of city. 8)
 
 
It's an amazing city  
 
 
Personally, I love London and I can't think of it as 'overrated'. Yes, there are problems and bad areas, but I love it here and I loved growing up here.
 
 
well overrated
 
 
I've never been  
Fingers crossed for Autumn 2014, hopefully I'll go to university in London!

 
London is cold, crowded and impersonal.

I'm a little fed up of living here, to be honest. It may be because I live in one of the city's less desirable areas, but there's still a big part of me that yearns for trees & green fields.   I like all the things London has to offer in a cultural sense, but I'd rather live in a green bit of Surrey.
 
 
Hmmm, let me think... it definitely has it's advantages. For example:

- rich and vibrant cultural life
- international milieu (you could argue that it's actually a downside, but personally, I think it's good for a capital city)
- world-class universities
- abundant opportunities for employment
- efficient transport system

Downsides:

- heavy traffic and pollution (you only realise this, when you go somewhere else in nature)
- too many annoying noisy tourists
- very expensive accommodation (in comparison with the rest of the UK)

Sooo, yeah - it's not bad.
 
 
 
is there a different way of pronouncing water?  

 

Well I and many of my fellow Northerners tend to say it like 'War-ter'

but people from London tend to say it like 'Wur-tuh'
 
 
 
Londoners do, it's not so bad out in the West country or North. But New Yorkers have all the bad manners of Londoners, in a stupid accent.

 

It's not just Londoners, it's the whole of Britain, definitely, it's turning Britain into one big toilet; these days you can barely go anywhere without cider drinking chavs hanging out around some vandalised bench/bus shelter. NYC is full of people that don't give a **** too, I agree. New York state on a whole is pretty nice though.

 
I pronounce it as film not filem  

I hate southerners who say aks instead of ask!

 

Ahhhhh, you win.

 
is there a different way of pronouncing water?  

 

Yes, 'waʔer' or 'woʔta' vs. 'warter'. It's all about the voiceless glottal plosive  
 
 
People that say London is overrated are probably living in a pocket which is unpleasant. However here In Belgravia - I really can't complain.

I love London in general - good buzz, nice places to eat and drink, great for work, good transport (although a bit of joke at rush hour + slightly annoying when the Fu**g train terminates before your stop) but on the whole it's a great place to live.
 
 
 
Well I and many of my fellow Northerners tend to say it like 'War-ter'

I am fairly sure everyone in the country says it rhyming with porter. Nobody says it wurter....
 
 
 
Yes, 'waʔer' or 'woʔta' vs. 'warter'. It's all about the glottal stop  

 

That's really the same though, you could easily find someone who says it both ways

Anyway I'm sure the glottal stop pronunciation is done by some people in the north and the south
 
 
The novelty wears off quick.
 
 
 
In a word: no.

I could go on and on about it, quote Dr Samuel Johnson at you ("when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life; for there is in London all that life can afford"), but London is just amazing. During my undergrad, I would get up in the morning and walk past Regent's Canal on my way to classes, if I wanted to go to the supermarket I'd see the City a mile away. It's just an amazing place to be in, living here is definitely not overrated or samey. The nightlife may be more expensive, but it's well worth it. I'm also a bit interested as to how you could describe Regent's Park or Hyde Park as "****"  

This is nonsense. The borough of Kensington and Chelsea is in central and you see ambassadors and the very rich, and a few roads down you're on the set of Kidulthood. Even London's suburbs are not all the same, Dagenham is nothing like Barnet for example. Most of London's central boroughs (Camden, Islington, Tower Hamlets, Westminster etc) have very nice areas, and not so nice areas. Such is the nature of urban living, this isn't exclusive to London.

London isn't perfect, for example public transport is quite expensive and fares rise each year, but I could never imagine living or studying anywhere else.

 

London public transport is very cheap compared to most other places!

Ok, forget water, lets move on to cow.

'Caaaaaaa'...

where the hell do they say that?

nobody does it here in Manchester anyway
 
 
London is awesome to visit but it may get annoying living there.
 
 
I don't mind London but it sucks compared to better places like Nyc
 
 
London is awesome, I love the diversity (in my new job I've met people from at least 20 different countries), and I think it's absolutely beautiful in a lot of places. Public transport is great as well, and there's so much to see and do, I don't think I could ever get bored of just walking around a new area and looking at the architecture etc  

I grew up in a much smaller city (Edinburgh) and the only thing that gets to me sometimes is the sheer number of people, the packed tube carriages and crowds of people I have to navigate on my way home. Even in the parks it always seems like it's difficult to find somewhere quiet with no people around, and I miss being able to do that sometimes.

Go to Hyde park when its pissing rain - it's bliss!

That's true, I've only really been on nice days, and I guess everyone else has the same idea   My favourite time of the week here is 7am on sunday mornings - empty pavements, empty roads, empty buses...
 
 
 
I am fairly sure everyone in the country says it rhyming with porter. Nobody says it wurter....

 

Nope, I've noticed a very distinct difference, I say it as porter like you mentioned but a lot of people from London tend to say it like wurter.

'Caaaaaaa'...

 

Nooooo anti-duck, a far more controversial one is how to pronounce 'bath'.

I say it as 'bath' using an 'a' sound like in 'apple'
I've noticed Londoners say it like 'barth' using an 'ar' sound like in 'far'

Oh and I say 'cow' using like a similar sound to ' ow l'
 
 
 
I have lived in London all my life and personally I hate it. More crime, 'chavs' and litter coupled with rude people always in a rush give it a thoroughly impersonal, unattractive feel.

 

Do you want to swap flats with a countryside one? Lots of trees, laid-back people, litter only in rubbish bins. Very personal, neighbours know everything about you. No chavs. No crime. A traffic jam is three cars behind a tractor.

But then you're forgetting than Londoners are renowned for not pronouncing 'th' correctly, it would be 'barf'  
 
 
 
i came away from miami, madrid, barcelona, berlin, rome, paris, amsterdam, brussells, bruges, lisbon, sydney all feeling like i'd seen a truly pleasnt ''global'' city.

of all th global cities, london is the only one i havent absolutely fallen in love with. i've spent the most time there too

my fave is barcelona. best place i have ever visited

 

most of the cities you listed are not in the least 'global' cities

barcelona? bruxelles? BRUGEs for god's sake????

Whaa-? Barcelona is most definitely global. Loads of foreigners there. Much more global than Madrid. Brussels is the capital of EU, again, very global, or at least pan-European.

Ahahah so true!!  
 
 
Londons amazing, you can't not go there and be impressed.
 
 
London rocks    
 
 
Maybe I'm biased since I live in London, but even if I didn't - there's such a wealth of things to do and see here that are far off the beaten track, that make it such a wonderful city. Yes, it's very touristy in the centre of London which makes it a bit impersonal sometimes, but it's also an example of how open London is culturally. I think it's a beautiful city.
 
 
There is always something to do imo, including Barclays bikes  
 
 
You take the kid out of London, but you can't take London out of the kid.
 
 
 
.... Personally, I absolutely love London, The people, the accent, the multiculturalism, the excellent public transport system, the history, the fact that when in London one can NEVER be bored and short of something to do. What is not to love? I love going down to London and I wish that I could do so more often.  

 

If you are tired of London, you are tired of like
 
 
 
I hate that quote, it ****s me off. I didn't really mean Regents park or Hyde park, more the like so of Mile End park, London fields or whatever,not the nicest places to relax at times I'd imagine, and even those area would be dman hard for me to afford. Ie rich people in the middle, yes I get you, but it's very ghettoised, I suppose I wasn't clear, what I mean about Paris was middle class average people not rich in the middle, families milling about, it's relaxed, the really bad estates are on the outskirts, and in London you have this extreme wealth pushed up against the rough element in the middle, doesn't seem to be much in between, that's why it's not as nice to relax in. I love Bloomsbury, for example, but even that has it's element and isn't as nice to be in at night as Paris is. I don't know about nightlife, like I say I love Bloomsbury and Holborn, though the pubs are pricey as **** and probably the restaraunts. Was just saying that you can see bands, go to a club, differing restaraunts etc in other cities, loads of uni towns etc.
I never went out in Mile End when there, imagine that's entirely different.
There's places like highgate which Londoners love but I didn' think it was that good, pubs weren't friendly, bit miserable tbh. Hampstead is an example of the wealth divide thing, seems like you're either somewhere didgy or somewhere ridiculously posh and other worldly, too ghettoised. Just off the top of my head.
I do like East London tbh, it hasd a lot of charcacter more than Highgate Finchely etc which I thought was boring. but again, I dunno what the crime element is like. I studied there abit, but I can't imgain eliving there, if I wanted to live in Bloomsbury I'd have to be loaded. Whereas my friend on a modest middle class income has a flat right in central Paris, gorgeous area.

 

Okay, I have I feeling I am going to regret asking this, but as I my student halls for this year are in the mile end area....what's the place like?

That bad? :O

 

To be honest, I've never been there in all the 3 years I've lived here, so I can't comment much. Just that it's next to Bow which isn't too nice. I'd wait for someone who lives there to comment, sorry to scare you!
 
 
 
i totally agree and in fact i was thinking of starting this same thread very recently

I understand that people will always disagre and we all like different things, so i'm not going to judge you if you disagree with me or if you like london. i just myself totally loathe it lol.

i was there for the umpteenth time just this week for a job interview. The minute you step off the train itt's like you're confronted by aa diffferent kind of human, and aggressive and angry form. there is no space. people are rude. if i smile at people, which is normal where i live, people get suspicious so i realise i need to adopt a hard nose attitude and stop smiling or people are gonna shank me. the prices are absurd. you need to earn about 40k a year to afford a one bedroom former council flat in the worst areas of it. the commute was horrible, got of at bank at 8am. actually thought i caught depression on that journey

Got off, saw the bank of england, the gherkin etc and whilst the user 'democracy', which i respect, obviously enjoys being around such famouss landmarks it didnt redeem the city for me.

maybe it's cos of where i am from. i come from south devon where i can drive to any of about 20 different beaches in 20 mins. or i can drive to a tor at the top of dartmoor and see the coast a whole 35 miles away on a clear day and just take the world in. oh and by drive i mean actually driving not being stuck in a jam. i've driven a lot in the south east, and you dont do any PROPER enjoyabke driving past reading! also, the people are courteous. if you drop a shopping bag you're bombarded with people fighting to hand it back to you! and it's not even that rural, north devon is, but in the south exeter actually has a lot of business. okay, there's no ''city of london'' but i personally wouldnt do that anyway. i want tto be an accountant, and we have that 5 minutes up the road. sure, i may earn 30k ijnstead of 50k, but here, as in most places outside london, i will live a better live on that here than i could on 100k in london (bigger house, moremoney for clothes). and that is a statisitcal fact. all round, that to me is a better quality of life....but i guess i mut be missing something because apparently it is better to live in london working 60 hour weeks and getting the tube in a concrete jungle and being scared to go out at night, paying your million pound 1 bedroom mortgage off for the rest of your life

anyway, like i said i respect we cant all agree. so no offence to londoners. but dont go thinking i just some prick who has only sseen it on telly, i've spent a LOT of time living in london. i know the score and im entitled to have an opinion on it....it's nott like i've only been there on the odd day trip. i KNOW i hate it  

 

I find it funny that a lot of posts i read about big cities always mention not being able to smile at people   are you not satisfied with smiling at people you know? lol i don't know about you but i don't exactly suffer much with not smiling at strangers

To be honest, I've never understood this. I used to get the Victoria line to and from work every day and if anyone ever banged into anyone else or something, they'd say sorry with a smile and get a smile back...
 
 
I've lived in London for my whole life.
It's expensive to live here and it does get hectic, so, it's great to get out sometimes. However, having said that, I do love London in some sense. It's full of character.
Paris is nice for a holiday, but, it gets boring quickly. I guess it's the same for London to some people.
 
 
 
most of the cities you listed are not in the least 'global' cities

barcelona? bruxelles? BRUGEs for god's sake????

 

yea the capital of an economic union with GDP bigger than either the usa or china and the sixth biggest metropolitan area in europe aren't global cities  

I was only listing all the cities i'd been to anyway. if anything london being trumped by a non global city would only prove my point even further anyway  
 
 
In my opinion yes, quite overrated indeed

maybe it's years of living here, with similar sorts of people and not branching off as such into another city, but yeah I feel like I'm getting 'bored' with it. London doesn't suck, but I just think there are some seriously amazing cities worldwide, the thought of going to them genuinely interests me
 
 
Went to London on a uni open day.

Fell in love.

Can't wait to spend the next 3 years (hopefully more) there.
 
 
 
People that say London is overrated are probably living in a pocket which is unpleasant. However here In Belgravia - I really can't complain.

I love London in general - good buzz, nice places to eat and drink, great for work, good transport (although a bit of joke at rush hour + slightly annoying when the Fu**g train terminates before your stop) but on the whole it's a great place to live.

 

Yeah... that doesn't make you sound stuck up at all   to be fair I see your point, but a city banker living in Chelsea, knightsbridge or wherever can still be unhappy. Of course even being rich and living in a nice area doesn't necessarily = happiness
 
 
I actually love London. I love the Thames and all the canals. I love the parks. I love how each area has its own character. I love the architecture of the old and new buildings and though it looks a bit odd when they're next to each other I still find it pleasant. I'm never really bored, even if I don't have much money I can always find something to do. The only things I would change is how crowded it is and the rich and poor divide. I don't get all this crap about Londoners being rude. Yes there are rude people here (considering its size its not surprising) but that's like most places. Most people I meet in my day to day life here are friendly. People are ruder in central London or zone 1 in the underground because its mostly business commuters who are in a hurry or tourists. This is just my experience but I've lived here for 18 years now (yes I have been to other cities) so I think my experience should be varied enough.
 
 
 
Okay, I have I feeling I am going to regret asking this, but as I my student halls for this year are in the mile end area....what's the place like?

 

Mile end is very close to white chapel and is a heavily Muslims area. Most of the Muslims are Asians (from pakistan ect) and not Arabs. You will be right next to Mile end park which is quite nice and tends to have events going on quite frequently. You'll also be near regents canal which stretches to Limehouse canal (you can get to the thames from there) to regents park. I find the canal very pretty. You can get a 25 bus into central London quite easily or a 205 into Islington (my favourite area atm). You're also close to the docklands and poplar (where you'll find Chris street market). The area is generally very busy, so you won't really have that 'I'm all alone walking down a dark street' kind of feel. Outside a club next to mile end station there is occasionally trouble, I would avoid this club it is ****. You'll find plenty of expensive and cheap food places in the area. You're also close to victoria park (despite being in Hackney I find it to be a very beautiful place) and roman road and bethnal green. Mile end road can get very busy at times.
 
 
London is the centre of most things, no London, no UK.
 
 
This seems to be a case of 'grass is greener' for people who live in London and 'London is the best' from people who don't, but wish to.

I, personally, think that London is a fairly nice area; certainly when compared with other comparable UK cities. It has it's flaws, but that's not an issue only suffered by London. If you like the cities, London will trump most other world cities. However, if you don't like cities, then you won't like London as much. Simple.
 
 
I am in love with london. I have had nothing but good times in that place. It's so multicultural and there is always something to do! Something which Bristol lacks unfortunately   I am hoping to move there one day though! I just need to experience life in london at some point in my life...... but yeah the price of living is tad ridiculous though.
 
 
A bit..
 
 
 
OK, I know southern people, especially middle class ones like to was lyrical about it, and there are areas I love. But seriously, as a city to live in full time, isn't it overrated? It has endless areas where I could not tell did I not know were any different, all being exactly the same in character(OK not including Bloomsbury, Docklands, Camden ad other distinct places) and is just endless to know well. It has a massive rich poor divide with the poor living right in the middle and the rich often quite far out, the opposuite of Paris, the city I think outstrips it completely in intrigue and beauty. The prices are huge for small accommodation, the places you go often don't give very personal service, as it's so hectic, it can be so congested it's impossible to feel an escape and when you do the park might be a **** one with bad stuff going down there. The tube works well but is miserable. And there are tons of things that you can do elsewhere, other places that are cosmopolitan etc, that don't make me buy the lifestyle argument, nowhere else is 'with it' etc.
I don't want a load of vitriol, I do find it impressive ins ome respects, I just get a little bored of it in every conversation down here, how nowhere else is worth being etc. I understand it's grandeur trumps other UK cities but to suggest that there can't be anything worth being part of or interesting other places irritates me.
So, are these people clued up or what? What is your view?

 

I live in London and in my opinion, yes.

But it's all down to personal opinion...i like a bit more countryside tbh.
 
 
 
I find it funny that a lot of posts i read about big cities always mention not being able to smile at people   are you not satisfied with smiling at people you know? lol i don't know about you but i don't exactly suffer much with not smiling at strangers  

 

I live in Birmingham and I smile at people all the time and they don't look confused or suspicious lol  . Sounds like London may be a whole different kettle of fish though. (I'm not even sure if I used that saying correctly).
I keep completely changing my mind as to whether or not I want to go there for uni, I don't really want to go somewhere smaller than B'ham so that restricts me to like 3 cities D:
 
 
 
I am in love with london. I have had nothing but good times in that place. It's so multicultural and there is always something to do! Something which Bristol lacks unfortunately   I am hoping to move there one day though! I just need to experience life in london at some point in my life...... but yeah the price of living is tad ridiculous though.

 

It's funny cos I see Bristol as desirable. Good size, bigger than here but not massive, near great country etc. London you are stuck in miles of it. I suppose I'm not averse to big cities, it's just the argument that no-one or nothing is interestign anywhere else that annoys me, and the fact I don't think it's as good as Paris or maybe NYC. I also don't see why a city has to be that vast to be continually interesting, Manchester, Bristol, Liverpool etc have that potential to an extent to me.
 
 
 
Okay, I have I feeling I am going to regret asking this, but as I my student halls for this year are in the mile end area....what's the place like?

 

Well, not entirely negative like they are saying. I guess it's got it's rough areas near, but Mile End is on the central line straight int Bloomsbury/Holborn, which is great, and it's on the Mile End Road, there's a park therre which looks nice enough though I'm told it's a tad rough. It's got character though, like a lot of East London to me, you can see the Gherkin down Mile End road I beleive, and the actually Queen Mary campus is really nice, beautful modern building, airy, nice bar and restaraunt. I studies down there a good while and reallyl iked, it's just a case of caution with surrounding areas I guess.
 
 
 
so basically London is just a bunch of places to spend money and occasional things to look at that anyone actually living there would probably get bored of third time looking........... so what is actually good about London?

 

Exactly, so many people ares tuck out in Finchley or Crouch End etc, they probabaly never go to all the great things up west or whatever-cos it's so vast.
 
 
 
economically, as you have pointed out, london is virtually globally unrivalled. in europe it IS unrivalled.

But for a lot of people that does not translate as ''great place to live''. its a matter off opinion. for me personally, that dosn't convince me to live there as i know having lived there, birmingham and devon that for me it's my least favourite. you like the place which is fine, we cant all agree.

it's jsut that people like you need to understand that not everyone cares about how many ftse 100s or unis they live near. it's not like we can't either commute and its not like our kids cant choose to move to london to go ucl or imperial if they wish! or in my case i can do the same graduate job i want elsewhere anyway 9and be better of financially too, 4k a year after bills and taxes etc, even though the salary in london for my job is almost double)

if i'd wanted to do the job in london i could, in fact i was asked if i wanted to switch to that office. i said no. if i wanted to i could be living and working there. but i dont. you have to respect that my criteria for what make s good place to live is different to yours, and indeed probably to the guy who liked seoul  

 

Exactly it isn't that it isn't grand, just the fact that you can have an equally interesting life anywhere else is understated. In fact people in such a city are probably too consumed by the fact they live there and not other things, take themselves with more attitude/seriously etc.
 
 
I like London.

I just think everything is a little too spread out.
 
 
 
.... Personally, I absolutely love London, The people, the accent, the multiculturalism, the excellent public transport system, the history, the fact that when in London one can NEVER be bored and short of something to do. What is not to love? I love going down to London and I wish that I could do so more often.  

 

The Black People in South London who cause crime?
Or How about the Muslims who live in their own community.
 
 
yeh itsz overated.
 
 
 
one final thing, a lot of people who i have discussed this with refer to the ''money in london''. okay, i know that london has a 1% of very wealthy people (though it has the most relative poverty in england, to me almost every road even the ''nice '' areas look like absolute slums. hardly anyone has detached houses like in much of the country).

But, even the ridiculously expensive areas like knightsbridge and park land etc are not that good, okayy they cost like 20 million but all that shows is that some foreign billionaires need a place near the financial centre of europe. its a convenience thing. the areas are not even that great. the riich people i know in the south west and the midlands live in 40-50 room mansions with ACRES of land and, in devon, private beaches, outdoor pools etc. in london park lane you just get some, albeit extremely nice, townhouse which is often a terrace! tthey arent even that good, the areas! honestly, if i had that kind of money the last placei would live would be one of those! so im sorry, but thats an argument that doesnt win me over sorry. i'll take my mates house on the devon coast with a private beach, massive outdoor pool, annex over the cliff edge and 30 plus rooms and a golf cours thank you. and you cant gethat in park lane (underground stuff like what abramovich and ecclestone have doesnt count. ) the only rich people in london are the ones who ned to be there for their business, which is most of them....thats the reason theres money in london, not cos they choose to live there. trust me i know, cos about 50% of the population on south devon is retired londoners who couldnt wait to leave and get morre for their money the minute their business got soldd and they didnt need to be near the ''amazing banking industry'' anymore

 

I don't really like the idea of private beaches though, that's like Italy. I think the cvoast should be everyone's.

I don't like the lifestyle of many of my friends who've moved there though: living in rather drab places on the outskirts where the pubs are crap and the shops are awful, who simply commute into the centre every day on the Tube and end up having after-work drinks instead of a decent night out.

.

 

Exactly. There are so many people in Londond like this, in flatshare, tiny places, can't get a mortgage etc. nightmare to raise kids too. It's more of a visitors city to me, transient, can't imagine living there. When yu are out on one of those places just inside the M25 or on the edge of the tube line it's really **** IMO. Like you describe, drab, you miss out on the beuaty in the middle, and plus I can get a direct train to Kings Cross from Cambridge much quicker than a load of those tube rides on the outskirts could get in or across London.
 
 
 
Lot's of cities are superior to London in some ways. You don't have to go abroad to find a cleaner city, for example. But when it comes to actually living somewhere - you seriously would take Istanbul, Hong Kong or anywhere in Spain over London?

None of those cities have the cultural variety and international nature of London. None of them are a major business hub like London is, none of them (except LA) have universities that can rival London's.

Sure, as a tourist you may think they are nicer in some ways, but I doubt you have any plans to move there do you?

 

It depends what you're looking for-is international nature so great, or would you rather somewhere that actually feels like the country you live in? I think the French would see that differently, and probably the Yanks too, even though NYC is nternationalist. If you went south in Europe you'd get mountains, sun, different lifestyle and maybe a city with more of that countries feel.
 
 
 
But whingeing about London is so massively old. It is the second most visited city in the world by foreign tourists and most visited by foreign business visitors. Given that foreigners don't give a flying cr*p about this country's pathetic north-south divide, that should tell you everything you need to know.

 

I'm not whingeing, nor do I feel entirely negatively about it, just tryingto be realistic more than some-and actualy a perspective against London is more original than many people's slavish devotion to it and rejection of anywhere else in England. I just don't quite see the 'internationalist' 'other places are provincial' argument, I think it borders on pretension as a reason for living there. Is it so bad that Dublin feels more like Ireland, or Madrid more like Spain? It doesn't mean because they are not as internationalist that they are somehow mired in the past and miserable. Also, transience in a place and huge welath divides I've mentioned give it a slighty unreal and unliveable feel. As I say, I still love seeing it, and have great affection for time I've spent in bits, but never so much on a human level. Also, compettion between cities in one thing but not everyone want an entirely urban lifestyle.
 
 
I see what that guy said about central London. Despite all I've said, I would however, after visiting, often think, If I was loaded, I would love to live in Bloomsbury/Holborn, it's gorgeous. I also have an interest in Limehouse, Docklands etc areas. Just that whole are between those two areas, down the central line at first, city too, Bank, l'pool street etc, those are my favourite bits. Other expensive places like Hampstead and Chelsea I just don't like, they are way too rich and feel unworldly. didn't think highgate was a good as people make out either.
 
 
 
Yes. I live here, have done for most of my life, and I f***ing hate it. As soon as I turn 18 I am getting as far away from this hell hole as is possible.

 

How could you have possibly experienced London to it's fullest before you've even turned 18?
 
 
Yeah if you have the wallet of a corrupt Saudi prince London is a paradise. Otherwise it's smelly, polluted and very uncomfortable and crowded, especially on public transport. The people are awful, rude and unfriendly.

Give me a break.
 
 
I dont mind going there once in a while but i couldn't think of anywhere else i would hate to live more. (within reason so dont bother with WHAT ABOUT NORTH KORIA LOL!?!   )
 
 
 
Mile end is very close to white chapel and is a heavily Muslims area. Most of the Muslims are Asians (from pakistan ect) and not Arabs. You will be right next to Mile end park which is quite nice and tends to have events going on quite frequently. You'll also be near regents canal which stretches to Limehouse canal (you can get to the thames from there) to regents park. I find the canal very pretty. You can get a 25 bus into central London quite easily or a 205 into Islington (my favourite area atm). You're also close to the docklands and poplar (where you'll find Chris street market). The area is generally very busy, so you won't really have that 'I'm all alone walking down a dark street' kind of feel. Outside a club next to mile end station there is occasionally trouble, I would avoid this club it is ****. You'll find plenty of expensive and cheap food places in the area. You're also close to victoria park (despite being in Hackney I find it to be a very beautiful place) and roman road and bethnal green. Mile end road can get very busy at times.

 

Thanks, this is really useful to know  
 
 
There are certain parts of London I can't stand. Namely the City for starters - need I explain why? Then we have Islington. Ugly, dense and supposedly socially 'crunchy'. Basically that means it's full of middle class people who think they're too cool to live in a middle class area. They have 'hip' dinner parties and think they're a good deal more sophisticated than they really are. Then we come to Chelsea. Trashy, materialistic, stuck up. Some of the outer eastern suburbs seem pretty bad too, certainly as you get towards Essex where people don't know the meaning of style.

That said I've been to other parts of London that seem quite nice. Wandsworth, Richmond, Hampton, those sorts of areas are okay as you go towards Surrey. Greenwich too.
 
 
OKAY SO. After living in London for 9 weeks, I can tell you all that LONDON IS EVEN BETTER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.  

So many interesting things to do and see, so much life, history, beauty... best city in the world

Just a shame that London's residents have to endure the multiculturalism.

thanks for those wonderful comments about us londoners  
 
 
 
OK, I know southern people, especially middle class ones like to was lyrical about it, and there are areas I love. But seriously, as a city to live in full time, isn't it overrated? It has endless areas where I could not tell did I not know were any different, all being exactly the same in character(OK not including Bloomsbury, Docklands, Camden ad other distinct places) and is just endless to know well. It has a massive rich poor divide with the poor living right in the middle and the rich often quite far out, the opposuite of Paris, the city I think outstrips it completely in intrigue and beauty. The prices are huge for small accommodation, the places you go often don't give very personal service, as it's so hectic, it can be so congested it's impossible to feel an escape and when you do the park might be a **** one with bad stuff going down there. The tube works well but is miserable. And there are tons of things that you can do elsewhere, other places that are cosmopolitan etc, that don't make me buy the lifestyle argument, nowhere else is 'with it' etc.
I don't want a load of vitriol, I do find it impressive ins ome respects, I just get a little bored of it in every conversation down here, how nowhere else is worth being etc. I understand it's grandeur trumps other UK cities but to suggest that there can't be anything worth being part of or interesting other places irritates me.
So, are these people clued up or what? What is your view?

 

I was born and have grown up in London, but have also been to lots of other places, so I'd say I know rather a lot about London.

I'd disagree that most of the poorer people live in the centre and richer in the outskirts. you appear to be completely missing out kensington, chelsea, notting hill, battersea, knightsbridge etc! and then most of the outskirts of london are actually poorer areas - it's just portions that are richer, like richmond, wimbledon etc.

I'd say as somewhere to go to uni it's not amazing as you'll only be able to afford pretty poor accommodation in a horrible area.

But it depends what you're interested in. For me, I don't like those 'places with character' like camden etc. I appreciate having theatres and galleries though. There's a lot to do in London for free which is great.

If you're interested in a busy life, London is great. If you're interested in a bit more of a quiet, normal life, go somewhere else... but then anyone could work that out.

Free stuff? I don't live in London please tell me free stuff in case i go there in the near future, bare in mind museums, art galleries and parks are boring.
 
 
I do love the constant goings-on, but I couldn't live with it all the time; the people and traffic would get to me.

aah see that's where i'd disagree. in london there are many good museums with excellent shows on that change all the time. at the southbank centre there are always loads of interesting cultural exhibitions and music etc - i went to one which was an art exhibition where all the art was done by people in prison! also there's the london jazz festival there.

i also like parks... they're beautiful. and you could go to hyde park corner to hear people speak (generally slightly mad people shouting about whatever they believe in, very good to watch) and there are things like bbc proms in the park which is a fantastic concert. or watch the proms in the royal albert hall for only £5!

another good one is the lord mayor's show.

london is all about culture.... so if you're not interested in culture and broadening your horizons (this includes going to things like exhibitions, art galleries, museums) then why do you want to come to London???

This isn't really true; Central London is, for the most part, VERY expensive to live in and only the rich can afford to live there - look at areas like Knightsbridge, Kensington, Chelsea, Mayfair, Bloomsbury, Westminster... Although many suburby areas like Hampstead, Richmond and Wimbledon are middle class and affluent - and Surrey, which basically serves as a commuter-county for London has the highest GDP in the UK, others that are on the edge of the city certainly aren't - look at Feltham.
Other than that, London is a great city, and a lot of fun. One of my favourite things about it is how you can just wander through it and pass charming little clusters of shops and restaurants and things to do that aren't at all samey. You can walk from Covent Garden to South Kensington and everywhere you see will have its own individual appeal - this kind of wandering is not something I have found as enjoyable in places like Paris or New York. London is very beautiful seasonally, thanks to how many parks and trees there are and it's a great city to explore. It has the most Michelin-starred restaurants of any city in the world, and more galleries and museums than the average person can even begin to see all of. Despite all the bitching that we Londoners throw out about our transport system, it's actually pretty awesome - especially because *everybody* takes the tube, not just those who can't afford a car or taxi, because it's so fast and convenient.
London is just

Yes if you live there, no if you dont.

Being from London isn't much to boast about these days, given that the whole world lives in London now.
 
 
 
i came away from miami, madrid, barcelona, berlin, rome, paris, amsterdam, brussells, bruges, lisbon, sydney all feeling like i'd seen a truly pleasnt ''global'' city.

of all th global cities, london is the only one i havent absolutely fallen in love with. i've spent the most time there too

my fave is barcelona. best place i have ever visited

 

Barca.   Beautiful, bar the Gaudi. I would absolutely love to move there.

Back on topic, I love London. Mostly because when bands tour, they pretty much always play here. I also really love the museums and galleries.

no it definitely isn't. but if you're not interested in any of the amazing things London has to offer, you might as well go and live in any other city. (where it's cheaper to live)

Interesting. What's the east end like, I know it used to have a bad rep, but now I see that the gangs are mainly south and north/north/east etc, but the actually east bit, east of the financial city l'pool street etc, and towards limehouse etc, along the river, doesn't seem that bad. I also love these areas and find them characterful.
