That Hawaii felt compelled to pass a (ridiculous) law that would allow state
officials to ignore repeated requests for President Barack Obama's birth
certificate shows how inundated the Aloha State has been with such inquiries.
Come on, people: Obama was born in the United States. His mother was American,
to boot. Get over it.

The Los Angeles Times blog did a great service by reprinting in glorious color
Obama's Certificate of Live Birth. The post notes that twice since 2008,
Hawaii's health director has publicly vouched for the existence and authenticity
of the birth certificate. I urge Gov. Linda Lingle, R, to sign the bill. In the
grand scheme of things, it's not as important as, say, job creation. But it
would allow Hawaii, the birthplace of the president of the United States, to
officially tell birthers, who have long proved immune to truth, facts or reason,
to back off.
