Romania's centre-right Prime Minister Emil Boc announced a broad cabinet
reshuffle Thursday, with the departure of several key ministers, as the
country's economy struggles to recover.

The finance, economy, labour, agriculture, transport and communications
ministers are all to be replaced.

"The board of the Liberal Democrat Party (PDL) has approved the government
reshuffle," Boc said.

The names of the new ministers for those posts would be submitted to President
Traian Basescu, he added.

"I am sure they will help Romania return to economic growth in 2011," he
stressed.

The three politicians nominated to the finance, economy and labour portfolios
are lower-ranking members of the ruling Liberal Democrat Party (PDL), unknown to
the general public.

Analysts meanwhile warned the sacking of Sebastian Vladescu as finance minister
could complicate talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the
European Union.

It comes ahead of the expected payment of fresh instalments of a 20-billion-euro
rescue package, for which Vladescu was one of the chief negotiators.

The bailout was signed last year with international lenders and Vladescu was one
of the driving force behind the reforms required in exchange, which were
designed to cut the public deficit.

"It is a political decision," said Vladescu. "I consider it is a mistake."

Regretting that he would not be able to finish the reforms he had started, he
said he had been blamed for not having communicated the policy well.

Gheorghe Ialomiteanu, an economist elected to the lower house of Parliament in
2008, has been nominated to replace him.

Labour minister Mihai Seitan, another key member of the cabinet to lose his job,
was the architect of a pension reform required by the IMF.

Economy minister Adriean Videanu said he had preferred to quit in order to
devote more time to his post as PDL vice-president.

The reshuffle comes as the the government and the ruling PDL have seen their
popularity plunge since the adoption in June of a drastic austerity plan.

The package included a 25-percent cut in civil servants' pay and a rise in
value-added tax from 19 to 24 percent.

Though Romania edged out of recession in the second quarter, analysts have
warned the country is not out of the woods yet as the economy is expected to
shrink 1.9 percent in 2010.

The coalition government, composed of the PDL and the small Hungarian minority
party (UDMR), was sworn in in December 2009.
