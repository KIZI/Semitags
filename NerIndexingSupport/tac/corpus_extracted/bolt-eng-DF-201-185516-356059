 
 
Video Game Industry Cartel Conspiring to Harm Jack Thompson
 
 
[MontyPython]
And now for something completely different:  A man unhealthily obsessed about something other than 9/11 
[/MontyPython]

 
I have been asking the Justice Department simply to meet with me about [the video game industry's] criminal targeting of me for harm... Our US Attorney here has obstructed that effort... Instead of being afforded the Justice Department investigation to which I am entitled, I get today harassment from that same Justice Department...

 
Enjoy the change of scenery, friends.
 
 
Jack Thompson...

Glad he is getting the boot. He even dared try to cater to the anti-war crowd by saying video game industry was run by the military to recruit kids.
 
 
He's just mad he isn't getting his way. Also could be that he might be in a bit of  trouble .
 
 
Jack, meet whirlwind.
 
 
Jack Thompson is a modern tragedy. A man brought down by his own ego and thirst for power. I shed not a tear for him.
 
 
We were going to jump over three times our own height and land right on his head, but then we realized we were too out-of-shape to pull it off.

We're now trying to break bricks, hoping to get a star so we can just run into him.
 
 
 Again, which NWO agent is selling secrets to the ouside world? 

 And if letting outsiders know our secrets isn't enough....

Good thing no one knows our real weapons!

some NWO agent will get fired!
 
 
So we're not talking about this bloke then? :

2 Live Crew = residents of Liberty City projects in Miami.

What's with the squirrels?
 
 
What weapon will the Video Game industry use to off Thompson?
The BFG ("Big F-----g Gun") from "Doom"?
The Shrink Ray Gun from Duke Nukem 3d?
Talk about paranoia/
Jack Thompson is Mrs. Grundy squared.
 
 
Maybe we can introduce him to the 'BADD' people, the ones who were running around badmouthing D&D, and introducing a 'questionaire' that showed that they didn't have a hint of a guess of a small clue how an FRP game worked.

If that isn't the point of America's Army I feel that it may be time to look at some of the militry's spending.

Hm? Happy birthday, by the way.

Perhaps the gravity gun from Half Life. Gamers love that weapon.

So, since the US Army made and aggressively marketed AA, that proves the "video game industry was run by the military"?

Do you see a difference there?
 
 
 
What's with the squirrels?

 
And what's with Paul Simon, Paul Newman, Ray Charles, Ed Bradley, Jack Nicholson, etc.?

 
The court described one of Thompson's recent filings in detail. He dubbed it a "children's picture book for adults," interspersing images with text in his motion due to "the court's inability to comprehend" his arguments. Images included "swastikas, kangaroos in court, a reproduced dollar bill, cartoon squirrels, Paul Simon, Paul Newman, Ray Charles, a handprint with the word 'slap' written under it, Bar Governor Benedict P. Kuehne, a baby, Ed Bradley, Jack Nicholson, Justice Clarence Thomas, Julius Caesar, monkeys, a house of cards," the order said.

 
How very...odd.

Happy birthday, Captain!

I am kicking myself in the butt for forgetting that one. Nothing is more fun then using it to throw huge piles of scrap metal at your foes and crush them.

Sure but I think when countering that claim the disclaimer about AA is needed.
 
 
Jack Thompson is just odd.
 
 
 
He's just mad he isn't getting his way. Also could be that he might be in a bit of  trouble .

 
Jack Thompson (Campus shooting expert) is not mad and he has a certificate to prove it. Though if someone I knew was proud that they had a certificate that proved their sanity I would think they were *********** nuts.
 
 
The man is a loon 3. He compares video games to polio, introduced gay pornography into his own trial (who knows why?) and said the unbanning of Manhunt 2 in the UK was like molesting children.

Nobody should be listening to this nut.
 
 
For those who are unfamiliar with Jack Thompson:

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Th...%28attorney%29 

I think the terms "Crackpot", "Fanatic" and that wonderful Aussie term "Sticky Beaker"(someone who always sticks his nose in other people's business) can be applied to Thompson.
I also bet he is the kind of lawyer who, when he walks up to a courthouse, every judge who sees him says "God, I hope he is not on my docket".
 
 
 
Jack Thompson is just a stark,raving loon.

 
Fixed that for you.
 
 
For an interesting insight into Jack's mind, I submit the following email exchange he initiated with the creator of the VG Cats comic:

Yeah, with much more of a racial overtone to it. The day after 2 Live Crew got arrested in Broward, a (GREAT) alternative band called Too Much Joy played the same club and performed the entire Luke Skyywalker set list and not a thing happened to them.

FREE LUTHER!! Oh wait, he's been free for 19 years now.  
 
 
And in breaking news, Jack is possibly facing lifetime disbarment:

 http://www.gamepolitics.com/2008/07/...l-referee-says 
 
 
I love how he considers himself an expert, and yet, blamed videogames for the VT shooting before the identity of the suspect was even announced to the public. I sware he has Fox and MSNBC on speed dial by now. Almost as much of a tradgedy whore as Alex Jones. Well, almost.
 
 
I'm an expert too! On watching people self destruct!

..anyone want popcorn?
 
 
If you have the patience to read the 169 page referees report attached to that link, you will see examples of some truly unforgivable behavior by Jack. Not all of it is related to his video game shenanigans.
 
 
Alareth: I decided Jack Thompson was too much. I have some standard to my insanity, you know.  
 
 
 
In sending documents to opponents, Thompson would frequently attach a photocopy of his driver's license, with a photo of Batman pasted over his own, just to make sure they knew who they were dealing with.

 
How on Earth did he ever manage to get certified as sane?
 
 
When A state Bar Association, who are notoriously forgiving toward bad behavior by members of the Bar, recommends that someone be permamnently disbarred, you know things are really, really, bad.
 
 
Looks like his career of nuissance is at its final end.
 http://www.gamepolitics.com/2008/09/25/disbarred 
 
 
Considering his in court antics I'm not surprised.

I sure am glad he got his comeuppance.
 
 
 
Looks like his career of nuissance is at its final end.

 

Wow, are you ever an optimist.

 "Now the fun begins." 

 
Thompson looks forward to successfully litigating his federal claims, now before US District Court Judge Marcia Cooke in the Southern District of Florida.

Thompson always wanted to own a Bar. Now, armed with multiple US Supreme Court rulings that no state bar can do what it has done to Thompson, he is set to own that Bar.

 
 
 
 
If he would have halfway followed the standard rules of legal behavior, Thompson would not have been disbarrred. It was not his kooky stand on video games that got him disbarred... The Bar association, quite rightly, did not think the merits of his cause were the issue here....but his being a total stupid jerk about it.
Thompson can still file lawsuits though, like any citizen can. And he can also play the poor persecuted Matyr now, which is the only downside to this.
Now will the Gaming Industry cancel the Contracts it had out on Thompson?

Gee, I would have seen him shrunk down to a few inches by the Duke Nukem Shrink ray weapon, then stomped by the Duke's mighty foot....
 
 
Wow. I knew he had a bee in his bonnet about videogames, but I didn't realise how out there he was.

From Wikipedia:

 
In 2006, two Michigan gamers began a project dubbed "Flowers for Jack", soliciting donations to deliver a massive floral arrangement to Thompson’s office. The flowers were delivered in February along with a letter aimed at opening a dialogue between Thompson and the video gaming community. Thompson rejected this overture and forwarded the flowers to some of his industry foes, with such comments as "Discard them along with the decency you discarded long ago. I really don't care. Grind them up and smoke them if you like."

 
Apparently he doesn't even respond to the  North Korea treatment .
 
 
Awesome! What excellent news.
 
 
 
Wow. I knew he had a bee in his bonnet about videogames, but I didn't realise how out there he was.

 
At trials he would hand out copies of his drivers licence to opposition council and their clients. Oh and he replaced his photo with a picture of Batman, to let them know "who they were dealing with".

The man is 100% bat guano crazy.
 
 
I'm waiting for Penny Arcade to chime in on this.
 
 
Bad day for video gamers. Means that in future the critical talking heads will be slightly saner.

For some background.

 
Thompson's "high-profile crusades" have made him an enemy of video game aficionados.  [64]  On occasion, Thompson has sparred directly with the gaming industry and its fans. In 2005, he wrote an open letter to  Entertainment Software Association  president  Doug Lowenstein , making what he described as a "a modest video game proposal" (an allusion to the title of  Jonathan Swift  's  satirical  essay,  A Modest Proposal  ) to the video game industry: Thompson said he would donate $10,000 to a charity designated by Take-Two CEO  Paul Eibeler  if any video game company would create a game including the scenario he described in the letter. The scenario called for the main character, whose son was killed by a boy who played violent video games, to murder a number of industry executives (including one modeled on Eibeler) and go on a killing spree at the  Electronic Entertainment Expo . Video game fans promptly began working to take Thompson up on his offer, resulting in the game  I'm O.K - A Murder Simulator , among others. Afterwards, he claimed that his proposal was  satire , and to date he has not made his proposed donation.
In response,  Jerry Holkins  and  Mike Krahulik , the creators of gaming  webcomic   Penny Arcade  and of the children's charity  Child's Play , stepped in to make the donation instead, writing in the memo field of their check, "For Jack Thompson, Because Jack Thompson Won't." Afterwards, Thompson tried to get Seattle police and the FBI to investigate Holkins and Krahulik for orchestrating "criminal harassment" of him through articles on their site.

 
 
 
And Jack Thompson's attempts to be the Frederic Wertham for the 21st Century ends.
 
 
 
Apparently he doesn't even respond to the  North Korea treatment .

 
KCNA and Jack Thompson, a perfect match.

Thats not even the least of his problems. What happened to the racketeering?  http://www.penny-arcade.com/2007/3/23/

Nah.... He'll get his license back and then we will all discover the cake was a lie.
 
 
 
For some background.

 
I remember when that happened which is why I'm sure they are quite gleeful at the outcome of his disbarment hearing.
 
 
Thompson is nuts, but I still think EA games is the work of the devil.
And I will find LOTS of gamers who agree with me.

There is no possible way I could ever reasonably quantify all of the digital creatures I have dispatched in my many years as a gamer, but here's my best guesstimate.

Zombies (both Armed and Unarmed) - 43,000
Cacodaemons - Meh. Couple Hundred.
Defenseless Sheep - 500ish
Generic Interchangeable Masked Terrorist Character Models - 125,000
Imps and Other Lesser Minions of the Underworld - 1.5 million. I monster-grind a lot.
Hookers - 1500

Now, I have helped these digital manifestations to shuffle off this mortal coil with implements ranging from assault rifles to dragon's breath to an oversized lawnmower (Dead Rising. My favorite by far.) I listened to Ozzy Osbourne and I didn't have the best childhood, and I was bullied constantly.

I guess I fit Mr. Thompson's profile. YEAH, me and a couple of other thousand people.

I'm glad he got disbarred. I'm all for the right of people to campaign/lobby for morality in the media, but this guy was a power hungry goon in a suit.

Since he likes Batman so much, they oughta grappling-hook him upside down in Central Park for 72 hours.
 
 
 
Jack Thompson...

Glad he is getting the boot. He even dared try to cater to the anti-war crowd by saying video game industry was run by the military to recruit kids.

 
I dont know about run by the military but they are definitely doing something with gaming. They hosted a national Halo3 tournament and have advertisements on xbox-live.

My little burst of anger toward EA was due to the problems I am having with Will Wright's "Spore"...which was released with the worst bugs I have seen in a major release game in a while. It shows every sign of being pushed out the door by EA before Maxis was done testing it.
I can't run it from my hard drive....to start it I have to click on the exe file on the DVD rom. ANd it took me three hours to get it start at all,icluding some fun work editing the games config file.. And it takes five minutes to load.

YAWN. Why play a blatant U.S. Army Recruiting tool when you can play COD4 which pretty much owns AA in just about every conceivable way?

I confess, though. Haven't touched COD4 or any shooter since I got the Rock Band 2 wireless drum kit. Neil Peart is my bitch.

I'd like to see a Navy commercial showing some E-4 chipping paint for hours or unclogging a toilet...or dewatering spaces constantly flooding out by potable water overflow tanks.

Ahhh...memories. To this day, I bet if somebody yelled GENERAL QUARTERS next to me I'd start fumbling around for my flash gear.

Thats all? Still doesnt compare to Battlefield 2, their online-only wargame that couldnt maintain a stable connection until a good six months after release.

Jack, you glorious, magnificent, bastard.

Disbarred and then the SCOTUS decides not to even look at your appeal.

But no, you're the freaking Energizer Bunny of crazy and you won't even slow down will you?

Change scenes to Utah. Jack has been tring to get a game legislation bill he wrote pushed through.

It was vetoed by the governor and Jack has stirred up bad blood with the Utah AG.

Jack decides the appropriate thing to do is harrass his only ally in the legislature on Easter Sunday with an offensive email.

When asked to stop sending e-mails Jack decides to spam every member of the legislature with the same picture that angered Senate President Waddoups.

 The result was notice of of intent to prosecute Thompson under the Federal anti-spam laws 

Unswayed, Jack has now threatened the ENTIRE UTAH LEGISLATURE with federal prosecution on the grounds they have violated his civil right to petition the government.

 http://www.gamepolitics.com/2009/05/...re-prosecution 

I'd ask LashL to do a Thompson Legaltainment page but the sheer volume of crazy might hurt people.

omg. if he isn't a source of entertainment concerning game politics, i dont know what is. these last few actions, have shown him to be the batcrap insane moron he plays himself out to be.
 
 
This guy is more mental than a cartoon villain.
 
 
Fools like Jack get no 1ups for the end boss. So unless he comprosies himself uses his Game Genie to take the lowest of roads he'll never save the princess.
 
 
I know how to deal with his kind. If I ever see him, I'll accept his quest, and then never turn it in.

He'll just be waiting and waiting, thinking that any day I'll turn up and deliver the 18 Deranged Basilisk Hearts and 3 Frayed Kobold Jumpropes he needs to make medicine for his daughter, but it'll never happen. Nyah-ha-hah!

I knew Thompson was crazy, but his latest actions show a level of delusion that moves him from crazy to batcrap crazy.
You have to wonder how the hell he passed the Bar Exam in the first place considering the crazy lawsuits he is filing.

In one court filing against the proprietor of a website, he attached gay pornographic pictures that didnt even come from said website.

To celebrate the 1 year anniversary of his disbarment, Jack has issued a "Press Release" claiming that the Florida Federal Court decision was unlawful and therefore he will resume his law practice.

 
Immediate News Release – Sept. 19, 2009

Miamian Jack Thompson Set to Return to Practice of Law

On September 25, 2008, the Florida Supreme Court entered an order permanently disbarring Miamian Jack Thompson from the practice of law. Thompson had been a continuous member in good standing of The Florida Bar for 31 years.

He was “disbarred” by virtue of Bar complaints instigated by the broadcasters of the Howard Stern Show, against whom Thompson had secured $4 million in FCC decency fines, and by Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc., in retribution for Thompson’s appearance on CBS’ 60 Minutes to expose its sale of the cop-killing murder simulator Grand Theft Auto video games that had caused the deaths of scores of individuals, including three Alabama policemen whose families Thompson represented.

Thompson has just discovered that all of the court orders that resulted in his “disbarment” are void ab initio—legal nullities from the outset and thus of no force and effect. The Florida Supreme Court, in violation of the laws of Florida assigned to Thompson’s case a referee from Florida’s Eleventh Judicial Circuit, rather than from the state’s Second Judicial Circuit, where he would have received a fair trial. Bar counsel hid this fatal defect not only from Thompson but from the Florida Supreme Court as well.

What this means is that Thompson literally was never disbarred. See the mountain of case authority on the consequence of orders that are void ab initio, including Elliott v. Lessee of Piersol, 26 U.S. 328 (1828) and Vallely v. Northern Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 254 U.S. 348 (1920). This has been the law in this country for more than 180 years.

Thompson intends to resume the practice of law as a member of The Florida Bar on October 1, 2009. He has invited, this day, Mary Ellen Bateman, who prosecutes the “unlicensed practice of law” for The Florida Bar, to get a court order to stop him. Unless she acts, he’s back in business, and the children of this country will have returned to them the lawyerly labors of a man who a) secured the first FCC decency fines in the history of this country, b) the first verdict in world history that a sound recording was obscene, c) forced Time Warner to pull from stores worldwide Ice-T’s “Cop Killer,” d) and forced Take-Two, along with Senator Hillary Clinton to recall all copies worldwide of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, which cost Take-Two tens of millions of dollars.

Florida Supreme Court Justices Polston and Canady recently wrote: “Is it too much to ask that The Florida Bar obey its own Rules?” Apparently it is too much to ask. When government breaks the laws, there is no law.

 

As you can see it's full of crazy and imaginary events such as the claim that he forced Take Two to recall every copy of GTA: Vice City.

At what point does the court system finally decide that psychiatric help is required?

Indeed he seems to have gone completely insane.
 
 
Has anyone alerted LashL of this new development? I sense jail time in his future, not to mention several HI-larious legal filings.

He's certainly been in one hell of a nose dive...
 
 
anyone have a link to the actual release? I need to share this with my co-workers. They'll get a laugh out of it
 
 
Good stuff. I say let him! For the lulz.
 
 
So Thompson is going to try to practice law despite being kicked banned by the Florida Bar Association?
This is gonna be fun to watch.
Maybe the Great Goddess of Legaltainment can confirm what I think: Thompson can represent himself and file all the lawsuits he wants..such is the right of every US Citizen...but if he tries to represent anybody in court he is in deep Kimchee.

Why does he go after GTA? Why doesn't he go after google cause if I tied in "big titties" in google, it'd come up with millions of porn pages - much easier for a kid to access.

The man's a kook.
 
 
Oh, Jack Thompson. Thank you for out crazying the other anti video game moral crusaders and discrediting them by association. The sane, violent video game enjoying community should really send you a fruit basket or something.
 
 
Jack has discovered there are negative Facebook groups about him and when repeated faxes the the FB CEO to have them removed got no response, he filled a $40 million lawsuit against FB.

Jack has already proclaimed victory in the lawsuit based on the fact it was mentioned by the  Huffington Post  and  Bloomberg .

Oh,  one mouse click later...  Hahahahaha!
