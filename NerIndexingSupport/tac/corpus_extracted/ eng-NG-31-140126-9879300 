Congrats to FAU (my alma mater) -- so far we're the only team in the State
of Fla who has won a bowl game! (Gators will have something to say about
that tomorrow)    Seriously, watch one of their (FAU's) games next year if
you can. Rusty Smith is an exceptional quarterback (Howard recruited him out
of Jacksonvill and he was a life-long Gator fan) and will be a Junior next
year.  Reminds me of a more athletic Bernie Kosar - very heady.

Happy New Year to all (Its only 4:30 in Seattle, so we haven't left for our
party yet!)
