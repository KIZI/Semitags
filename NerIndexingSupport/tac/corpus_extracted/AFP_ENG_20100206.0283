Germany authorities have said they will not prevent the neo-Nazi NPD party from
distributing CDs outside schools with interviews and music by members of its
party, a report said Saturday.

The youth protection office said the disc by the National Democratic Party of
Germany, the country's most radical far-right party which touts an anti-
immigrant agenda, just contained political opinions, the report in the
Suddeutsche Zeitung said.

The office therefore found no basis on which to ban the disc, the report quoted
director Elke Monsen-Engberding as saying.

According to the NPD the original demand to ban the distribution of the CDs came
from the north east state of Lower Saxony.

On its website, the NPD welcomed the decision.

The party could "continue to try to transmit its ideas to young people,
schoolchildren and first-time voters", NPD member Claus Cremer said.

NPD legal affairs minister Frank Schwerdt, who has served two prison sentences
for inciting racial hatred and distributing Nazi propaganda, also appeared on
the website celebrating the decision.

In November last year, German authorities banned the sale of homegrown hard rock
group Rammstein's new album to fans under 18, for what it deemed explicit
sadomasochist lyrics.
