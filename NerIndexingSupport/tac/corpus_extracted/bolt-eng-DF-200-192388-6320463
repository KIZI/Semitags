Hello,
I am a girl with hobbies about fashion, shopping, football players and sun bathing. I am currently applying to study (Business Management) at LSE and KCL (mmm yes, you've read my interests above right).
Oh, i forget to say that i'm an international so be tolerant towards my english skills.  

Okay, that's it for now. Hope to have many great convos on here  .
Bye,bye, my precious  
 
 
  Welcome to TSR!  

 
 
 
hii girl with hobbies about fashion  . where are u from originally?
 
 
I knew that "hobbies about" didn't sound right but couldn't think of anything better at the moment  . I'm originally from Bulgaria :P
 
 
i love people from bulgaria  . are u still in bulgaria or moved to london? assuming kcl is kingston college london  
 
 
KCL is actually King's College London :P. Let's not turn the thread into a chat. I don't want to "get us all killed. Or worse, expelled."
