Greece's new Prime Minister George Papandreou says Turkey could boost its troubled bid to join the European Union by recognizing Cyprus.

Papandreou told Cyprus' Parliament Tuesday that recognition would revive talks aimed at reunifying the divided island.

Ankara does not recognize the Greek Cypriot-led Republic of Cyprus and backs a breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north, where it maintains 35,000 troops.

Papandreou says Greece backs Turkey's full membership of the EU, but adds that relations with EU members "cannot be determined by military might or threats."
