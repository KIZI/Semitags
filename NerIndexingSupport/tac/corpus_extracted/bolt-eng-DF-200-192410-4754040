Hi, please could anyone tell me the best place to buy adult-sized ponchos that don't fall apart easily and are a good price?

Thanks.  
 
 
Are you serious? Please don't buy a poncho!

This may come as a slight shock, but the OP can actually buy and wear whatever the hell she likes, and some people do have different fashion tastes to yours?

You aren't actually answering her question either, so take your spamming elsewhere.

I saw some poncho's in Littlewoods the other day, I don't know where else would stock them I'm afraid. You might wanna try online, as they aren't in the shops much anymore!
 
 
Camden market, I have one for camping.
