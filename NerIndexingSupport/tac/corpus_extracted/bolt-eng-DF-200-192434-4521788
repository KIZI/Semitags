 
 
...Name That Film!
 
 
OK,

Here is how this thread goes pick a memorable line, but not the most famous one, from a film, and then post it and see if anyone can name which film it is from.  
 
 
First from one of my favourite films   :

"I have already given him the best, knowing that he is German and will take it anyway"

And no cheating!  
 
 
easy, gotta be casablanca!

By the way funny quotes are good!   Here are a few more:

1) "Drug dealers? **** man. Did you see their clothes? Drug
dealers wouldn't be caught dead in those polyester rags."

2) "Sting would be another person who's a hero. The music that he's made over the years, I don't really listen to, but I respect the fact that he's making it."

3) "Feel the chi...Repulse the monkey"

Oh and add in who said the line if you know!  

"Your lust will hold you up."
 
 
Excalibur?

'Love means never having to say you're sorry'
lets try again with the right quote

'....I love you. You complete me!'  
 
 
Jerry Maguire?

My parents had an obsession with it.....when you see a film a lot you remember quotes from it....
 
 
"No, Mr [name censored], I expect you to die!"

Goldfinger. (it's Mr Bond   )

Considering I've never watched a Bond film all the way through, not bad, I'd say  

Edit: (other one probably not really appropriate   ): I'm just an ordinary guy with nothing to lose
 
 
1) "Drug dealers? **** man. Did you see their clothes? Drug
dealers wouldn't be caught dead in those polyester rags."

2) "Sting would be another person who's a hero. The music that he's made over the years, I don't really listen to, but I respect the fact that he's making it."

Still no takers on these two eh?  
 
 
the second one is zoolander (2001)  
 
 
is the first one The Goonies?

Well done. Youre getting the prize! some rep...    
 
 
i named the second movie! and i don't get anything?! not even acknowledgement?? fine   :getmecoat
 
 
Sorry, well done.   I just thought Zoolander was a bit easier than Excalibur and Goonies. I will give you some rep when I can.  
 
 
  no need for rep.but if you want sure,up to you  
 
 
"Tootie, remind me to spank you after dinner"
 
 
meet me in st. louis
 
 
Wow! Theres another one I thought no-one would get! I thought it was a really obscure film that I just happened to love.  
 
 
haha i have my ways   and i like old movies as well  
 
 
1) "Did you hear that? He's the perversion of nature. Wow, isn't that exciting?"

2) "I'll do anything sexual, I don't need a million dollars to do it either..."

3) "She's so deliciously low, so horribly dirty."

4) "To learn my teachings, I must first teach you how to learn."

5) "Look, we want you to express yourself, ok? If you think the bare
minimum is enough, then ok. But some people choose to wear more and we
encourage that, ok? You do want to express yourself, don't you?"

Heeehee  
 
 
Number 3 is My Fair Lady (Higgins about Eliza). Don't know the rest!
 
 
Number 5 is Office Space  

(Joanna's boss?)
 
 
Both correct!  
 
 
Is this post in the evening of life or the late afternoon? Does anyone else have some quotes?  
 
 
My mum died when I was a baby. A fluke accident during a routine liposuction!

wooooo! thank you!  
 
 
1. Ah, you know me, I'm too lazy to hold a grudge
2. Your aim's as bad as your cooking sweetheart... and that's saying something!
 
 
Dam it... there’s something vaguely familiar about all these. But I only have encyclopaedic knowledge of a few films.

1) "And that my liege is how I know the world to be banana shaped"

2) "What do you think, Josephine? What does it say in your crystal ball?"

"do you like your water?"
"sure, its my second favourite thing"
"whats your first?"
"...*****ing"
 
 
"do you like your water?"
"sure, its my second favourite thing"
"whats your first?"
"...fcking"
