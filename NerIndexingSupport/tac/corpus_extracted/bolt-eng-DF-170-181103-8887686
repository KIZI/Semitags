Media: The White House is now taking hits for trying to downplay a lavish Halloween party the Obamas threw themselves amid an economic crisis. But what about the reporters who dutifully complied with the cover-up?

In her new book, "The Obamas," New York Times correspondent Jodi Kantor relays a story about how the White House communications staff wanted to keep the 2009 party under wraps.

No wonder. Had the fact that they were holding an extravagant "Alice in Wonderland"-theme party — decorated with the help of director Tim Burton and featuring Johnny Depp in his Mad Hatter costume — at a time of 10% joblessness, it would have caused an outrage.

Subsequent reporting has found that Depp and Burton weren't listed in the White House entry logs, further bolstering the cover-up story.

But if anyone is guilty of a cover-up, it's the White House press corps.

There was, after all, at least one reporter at the party. But as Politico reports, the "dispatches from the party did not mention either Burton or Depp."

SNIP:

That's been true with the Solyndra scandal. It was true when odd goings-on with Obama-backed LightSquared emerged. And let's not forget the Fast and Furious gun-running scandal, which cost one American his life, and in which the head of the Justice Department was caught lying to Congress.

The mainstream press has been so diligent in ignoring Fast and Furious, in fact, that the White House felt comfortable screaming at CBS News investigative journalist Sharyl Attkisson for having the temerity to cover it, noting that no other "reasonable" mainstream outlet was doing so.

Jonathan Alter, a 28-year Newsweek veteran, even wrote a column for Bloomberg in which he lauded the White House for being utterly "free of scandal."

When he was pressed about the Halloween party cover-up, White House press secretary Jim Carney lashed out at reporters for being "irresponsible."

He's certainly got that right.

When that party is paid for by the American Tax payer they have a right to know what their hard earned money is being used for...don't you think?

Pictured: Inside the Obamas' secret Alice In Wonderland-themed Halloween party at White House that was kept under wraps for TWO yearsHeld during the depths of the recession, Obamas knew it would be bad PR

Johnny Depp and Tim Burton helped host the event but their names were kept off the visitor logs in an effort to keep the party secret

The first pictures of the infamous Alice in Wonderland Halloween party at the White House emerged today - just hours it was revealed the Obama administration kept the 2009 celebration under wraps for two years.

The pictures will likely add to the embarrassment for the administration as the Obamas have been highly criticized for hosting a lavish Halloween party- with guests like actor Johnny Depp and director Tim Burton- in 2009 at the same time that the country was in the midst of a recession.

The initial news of the party came from a book, written by New York Times journalist Jodi Kantor, which maintains that the reason why it was kept so quiet at the time was because the administration was aware that it would be in poor form for them to host an extravagant party when so many were suffering financially.

^^^^
so true

It's not about one celebration. It's about the ramifications of this kind of media complicity with the "most transparent" administration in history.
 
 
Oddly enough, the same media decided that Mitt Romney's decision to remodel and expand his house was a three day news event.
 
 
it never ends with the moochers, their attitude regarding the debt and joblessness never ends,,,its always,,,,ehh,,,F.......K the white working class and unemployed, we iz gonna spend dare money like its growing on trees, weze may az well enjoy stealing tax money while we iz still in day white house!
 
 
There have been worse cover ups.

Personally, I was so sick of all Obama all the time I would have turned off the TV if they had reported it. So he wants to party with Hollywood types. So did Clinton. It says nothing good about Hollywood types that they want to party with him.

As for worse cover ups, the local media here knew about the Mayor's relations with a 12 year old girl back when I was 12 myself. And the Carter people knew of it too when they appointed him Transportation secretary. And the media knew about the thing when he ran for governor. Didn't say a word.
 
 
What I want to know is were the Kardashians there?

I'll be pissed IF it was paid for by the taxpayer. If it was paid for by the Obama's privately then I see no reason why this would be my business. They are perfectly at liberty (Damn, I love that word) to spend their own money any way they choose.
 
 
 
 
Who gives a fuck if they had a gay ass costume party. Why hide it?

 

Because they knew they were doing something wrong.

 

What did they do that was 'wrong'? Genuinely, I'm interested. There is nothing to say that it was taxpayers money. If we paid for it, then, yea, that's an issue. But that may not be the case.

I have a very slight issue that the visitors logs do not reflect the attendees of said party, but, again, if it is a private event and they paid for it, I don't know that I'm overly concerned about the lack of official visitors log.
 
 
 
White House spokesman Eric Schultz rejected the book's claims Sunday. He said if administration officials wanted to keep it secret, they wouldn't have invited the press or posted video or photos to the White House website. "Just goes to show you can't believe everything you read in books these days," Schultz told Fox News.

Politico reports the White House explained local schoolchildren, children of military families and those of administration staff attended the event. "Even Johnny Depps fans knew about it and posted on their website." Schultz said in a statement.

 

 White House: Despite claims in new book, nothing secret about 'lavish' 2009 Halloween party | syracuse.com 

Looks like this book is less factual than the one that told us about Palin lovin' black men.
 
 
I really have to hand it to President Obama

After three years in office, someone writes an unauthorized tell all book and the biggest scandals in it are:

- Michelle Obama did not like Raham Emanuel
- The Obamas held a Halloween Party and didn't tell about it

God, this must be killing the Republicans as they try to rile up the base.......but at least they got Stephanie
 
 
So, Stuphie, what kind of toilet paper are those uppity Negroes using in the White House??? I bet it's quilted Northern instead of some economy brand!!!
 
 
I'm really not seeing the issue here. Maybe the media didn't blow the lid off because there is no lid to speak of.
 
 
As Cali says if the Obamas payed for it then who cares.

If we the taxpayers footed the bill then you bet your ass its something that should have been reported.

If Bush had done this it would be in 8 in inch letters on the front page of the NYT and the LSM would have covered it 24/7.

If this had happened it would be one more thing they could bash him with 24/7.

Yes...the Lamestream media can be so unfair

"Bush invades Iraq.....no WMDs found"
"Obama gives speech.....Telepromter used"

"Bush engages in torture"
"Obama plays golf during vacation"

"Bush does nothing as Katrina floods New Orleans"
"Obama gives Halloween Party and tells no one"

"Bush in denial as economy crashes"
"Obama bows to king"
 
 
FSM misses no opportunity to bash Obama. In fact, they make a lot of stuff up to do so.

So why hasn't the idiot OP author mentioned that this was a party thrown for children of military serving overseas?

When that party is paid for by the American Tax payer they have a right to know what their hard earned money is being used for...don't you think?

 

Maybe we can get a petition going to recover the $0.00003 from the IRS you personally spent on the party!

The media, dickhead. Not the Obamas. I have already stated on this thread that I have no issue with the party - unless it was funded by the taxpayer. And even then, it's mildly inappropriate... no big deal. But please don't let the facts get in the way of whining.

No problem, we all know you wouldn't care..you like the media in the back pockets of the Progressive party...that way you don't have to face any hard facts.

 

You just got your head handed to you Steph

Keep digging!

 

by who? Pfeeeesh..

believe what you will...
but we all know if the MEDIA had been involved in a cover up of the Bush's...well lets just say we all know what would happened..lol
 
 
 
 
 
They didn't hide it. Unless putting it on the White House website is hiding it.

 

The media, dickhead. Not the Obamas. I have already stated on this thread that I have no issue with the party - unless it was funded by the taxpayer. And even then, it's mildly inappropriate... no big deal. But please don't let the facts get in the way of whining.

 

Which media hid it? FOXNEWS? Why would they do that?

 

Why would it get wide coverage to begin with?

Fuck, Obama and the media are either obsessed with his every move or there is a conspiracy to hide what he does.

 

I really hope Romney campaigns on this Halloween party.
 
 
 
 
 
Anyone worked up over this should watch:

 Malice in Blunderland - The Colbert Report - 2012-10-01 - Video Clip | Comedy Central 

 

 
 

And another Wingnut attack FAILS.

 

What I love about this "scandal" is the assholes are not the least bit embarrASSed by their stupidity in swallowing this bullshit, but will just keep on swallowing whatever bullshit is fed to them by GOP hate media.

 

You mean like you ALL swallowed Palin and Black men...

heres one for you too....waaaaaa...    

 

Swallowed? Is that a pun? Stuphanie made a funny.

Most sane people can believe that there can be an attraction between people of different skin colors. Odd that you think it is so outrageous.

When it happened, on CNN!
This is what I love about CON$, no matter how thoroughly their lies are exposed, they just play dumb and keep on lying.

 Obamas celebrate first Halloween at the White House  CNN Political Ticker - CNN.com Blogs 

WASHINGTON (CNN) President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama are celebrating their first Halloween at the White House by inviting Washington area students and military families to trick or treat.
According to the White House, up to 2,000 kids between the ages of 6 and 14 years old are expected on the grounds of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue Saturday evening.
Three 1,000 lb pumpkins shipped in from Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Wisconsin will be on display, while children are entertained by Star Wars characters, snow globe fairies, bubble makers, and wandering trees.

 Obamas Continue White House Halloween Tradition 

 Today With President Barack Obama 

 

OMG!!! It's a White House tradition dating back at least until Nixon AND I WAS NEVER INFORMED!!!

What probably makes Stuphie the angriest is that Obama's costume was a suit: in fact he was costumed as the President.  

Stuphie! Have you checked on the toilet paper brand yet?
 
 
What else is new? The outrage factor! There might be bland coverage of some things just to pretend the story has been told but never ever any outrage in the media over the antics of democrat administrations. The media brought down the Nixon administration when it was easy to fake an informant and pretend that speculation was fact. Reagan's violation of a left wing senator's obscure amendment to a Military appropriations bill was the basis for outrage in the media about what they called "Iran-Contra". It was a piss-ant issue that was magnified a hundred times by fake outrage. They tried to get Bush with fake outrage about a CIA employee who was "outed" but she was outed in a hundred cocktail parties before Bob Novak ever printed the story. Today you have "Op-Fast/Furious where the Attorney General is responsible for the shipment of over 2,000 illegal weapons to Mexico and the resulting carnage of maybe hundreds of Mexican citizens and a US Border Patrol agent but no outrage. Minimal bland coverage and absolutely no sign of outrage.

How DARE they have a Halloween party for Military families and local D.C. students.

H OW DARE THEY!!!!????

 Obamas Continue White House Halloween Tradition 

 Today With President Barack Obama 

 

LOL, not what is being talked about...
it was THE COSTUME ball HELD AFTERWARD with Johnny Depp and other Hollywood actors..
my gawd..  

 

Why am I not surprised that you won't admit the truth?

The first photo is from the "ball" held inside the White House afterward.
Here is another inside the White House "ball" photo.

And here is a Nov 1, 2009 announcement of Depp and Burton attending the "ball" and the reception Depp received from the children.

 Johnny Depp News: ~Depp & Burton Attend Whitehouse Halloween Party~ 

President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama on Saturday handed out treats to more than 2,000 trick-or-treaters, marking their Halloween at a White House event partly aimed at honoring military families.

Johnny Depp & Tim Burton were amoung the attendess at the Whitehouse Halloween Party and apparently Johnny was very popular with the children because of his Jack Sparrow character from Pirates Of The Caribbean. It is not known yet if Depp & Burton dressed up for the Party but we do know there was some characters from The Night Before Christmas and apparently a tea party with the Mad Hatter....could this have been Johnny Depp?
 
 
Why does Stephanie hate the children of military veterans?
 
 
Impeachment proceedings for this, right Steph?

Gotta remember to turn on the BS meter, whenever 'something'Gate is in the title.  
 
 
Let's see.

The great Halloween-party-coverup story has OBVIOUSLY collapsed under the sheer weight of its idiotic buffoonery.

What's next? How about spinning the story another way?

Just say that Barack and Michelle Obama are practicing pagans who tried to lure young unsuspecting children to stand in a circle with an upside down pentagram in order to steal their souls for Satan, who, by the way, is a well-known Marxist. (Why do you think the devil is red?)

Of course it is, the rest of America is hurting under Obama rule, and the white house throws this type of shit party? Nothing new here, just think of the omissions coming out of air force one on the 30 flights a month the bastard takes, and he is a green energy general? Let me let you in on a little secret, socialism is for the people, not the socialist. He can give a fuck less about his supporters, as long as he and Michelle can fly anywhere in the world and waste all the tax payer money available, the perfect fucking socialist. Hugo Chavez is so proud of him.
