DAYTON, Ohio -- Our American Civil War was a national tragedy.
One hundred fifty years later those echoes of carnage and
heartbreak still resonate. Civil War history fascinates us. That
epic struggle between North and South has provided fertile ground
for some fine works of fiction too, books like "Gone With The
Wind" and "Cold Mountain."

The Tennessee writer Robert Hicks based his debut novel, "The
Widow of the South," on a true story from the Civil War. It was
inspired by one of the most horrific battles of 1864 when the
Confederate Army under the command of Gen. John Bell Hood, suffered
catastrophic losses at Franklin, Tenn. Hood made poor decisions.
His troops paid for Hood's bullheaded tactics with their lives.

Hood was a legendary tragic figure. During his early military
career in Texas he suffered an arrow wound to his hand. At
Gettysburg a severe wound to his arm left it useless. Then at the
Battle of Chickamauga he was so gravely injured that one leg had to
be removed. Miraculously, he survived.

Had he died, he might have been remembered as a heroic figure.
But he lived and is now mostly remembered for the disastrous rout
at Franklin.

Robert Hicks has based his second novel, "A Separate Country,"
on Hood's post-war years. Hood moved to New Orlean's where he met
his future wife, Anna Marie Hennen.

She was a Creole belle who fell in love with the much older
general. They married and over the course of 10 years she bore him
11 children. Hood tried his hand at business. He ran an
unsuccessful cotton brokerage firm. When that failed, he went into
the insurance business. That venture collapsed amidst the Yellow
Fever epidemic that devastated New Orleans over the winter of
1878-79.

Hicks tells Hood's story from three viewpoints -- that of Hood,
his wife, and a young man named Eli Griffin. As the book opens,
Hood is on his deathbed, dying from the fever. He summons Eli and
instructs him to resolve some important matters for him.

Hood has been writing books. One is a history of his Civil War
experiences. The other is the story of his post-war life. This
story builds momentum from the instant Hood dies. The author rolls
out a cast of fascinating characters who slide in and out of the
story as it is
related by our three narrators.

Anna Marie has three childhood friends who drive the plot along.
There's Father Mike, a gigantic, hairy Catholic priest; Rintrah is
a dwarf and the leader of a criminal syndicate; Paschal is a gifted
musician and a lady's man.

Hood's narration consists of Eli's reading of the general's book
about his life. Hicks immerses us in a steaming gumbo of racism,
gambling, class struggle, pride, forgotten massacres and poignant
memories.

"The Widow of the South" has just been re-issued in a
paperback.
