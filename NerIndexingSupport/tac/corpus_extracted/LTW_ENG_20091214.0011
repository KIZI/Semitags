State budgets are tight and getting tighter, but politicians in
Wisconsin are determined to promote the Badger State in a slightly cheesy
way:

The state Assembly is considering a bill that would name the bacterium
that converts milk into cheese as -- ready for it? -- the official state
microbe.

The microbe, Lactococcus lactis, is poised to join the state's list of
21 designated symbols, which includes an official dance (the polka),
beverage (milk) and domesticated animal (the Holstein dairy cow). It also
would be a first for the nation.

The idea first bubbled up a couple of months ago, when researchers at
the University of Wisconsin-Madison's department of bacteriology contacted
lawmakers with suggestions of how to draw attention to the state's emerging
biotechnology industries and long-standing roots in agriculture.

Cheese, after all, is huge in Wisconsin, and lawmakers have never been
hesitant to tout the industry to rally support. The state proclaims itself
America's Dairyland on its license plates and is a booster of its $18
billion cheese industry. But even these Cheesehead leaders were a bit
perplexed by the bacteria idea.

"My first reaction was, `Uh ... why would we do that?' " recalled
Democrat Rep. Gary Hebl, one of the lead authors of Assembly Bill 556. "But
then we started talking about it, and it made sense."

It's even got the university's bacteriology department excited.

Lactococcus lactis, Hebl learned, is the chief starter culture for a
variety of cheeses and other dairy products and is also being engineered to
improve vaccine delivery.

He and a crew of fellow Democrats decided that they'd introduce the bill
last month, in part because, "We've been making a lot of painful cuts in our
budget, and this doesn't cost us anything," Hebl said.

Besides, he added, "Wisconsin has a blossoming biotechnology industry
and being the first state in the nation to adopt a state microbe is a great
way to tell the world that Wisconsin is moving biotechnology
forward."

Well, that's one way to do it. Some of his peers, though, wanted to give
the microbe a name a wee bit easier to pronounce.

But Hebl wouldn't hear of it. "There was talk about calling it `little
cheesy,' " Hebl said. "No way. Lactococcus lactis is easy to remember. It's
like French, it just rolls off the tongue." (It's pronounced lac-tow-co-kus
lac-tis, by the way. Duh.)

The bill, currently in the state affairs and homeland security
committee, is set for a committee vote on Thursday. If all goes well, its
fans expect it to go to the Assembly floor for a vote in mid-January.

Political history is not usually made on a second-floor balcony in the
Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn.

But that's where 33-year-old Jeremy Paul Olson -- observing the lines
and hoopla at former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin's book-signing at the  Barnes
& Noble recently -- lobbed not one but two tomatoes in the direction of
the former Republican vice presidential candidate.

Instead of hitting Palin, he hit a cop and was arrested for disorderly
conduct and assaulting a police officer.

Gawker called the Bloomington jail and talked to "a bored-sounding
officer ... apparently indifferent to the feat of produce-based
heroics."

The site added: "If anyone has information on the tomato-wielding Real
American Hero Jeremy Paul Olson, please e-mail us. Who is this man? What
motivated him to throw tomatoes at Sarah Palin? And most importantly: How
could he miss!?"

Palin, who has sold more than 1 million copies of "Going Rogue," kept on
autographing, with her husband, Todd Palin, at her side. Certainly her fans
ignored any sign of trouble -- after lining up in freezing weather before
the mall doors opened at 5 a.m.

The editors at Golf Digest had this great idea. President Barack Obama
has been playing a lot of golf lately. And according to a detailed report in
The Wall Street Journal, not playing that well. So why not invite Tiger
Woods, the world's pre-eminent golfer, to give the president some
tips?

And, in another brainstorm, they even Photoshopped an image of Woods in
a caddie outfit posed behind Obama as he judged a putt.

After all, Steve Rushin explains in the January issue, they are at the
top of their fields, both "prominent, multi-ethnic" African Americans, both
with an older man as second lieutenant -- Vice President Joe Biden and
caddie Steve Williams.

Mostly, said the writer, the difficulty of their tasks is similar.
"Shooting back-to-back 65s at Firestone Country Club is -- ask any golfer --
every bit as difficult as achieving world peace," he wrote.

But that was before Woods was embroiled in a personal saga gone public,
with so many women now stepping forward to claim a relationship with the
star golf pro that some people are talking about  Woods' tally and  back
nine.

Readers are flooding the magazine with complaints about Woods' behavior,
along with some choice tips of their own like, "Don't get caught!"

One interesting political note. The magazine asked readers how much golf
Obama should play.

Nearly 46 percent said "as much as he can without affecting his work,"
and 8 percent said never -- and that was before Woods' Thanksgiving driveway
stunt.
