A former senior National Security Agency official is facing a slew of charges
over the leaking of classified information about the super secret intelligence
agency to a newspaper reporter.

Thomas Drake, 52, of Glenwood, Maryland, was charged in a 10-count indictment
handed down by a federal grand jury in Maryland, the Justice Department said in
a statement Thursday.

Drake, a high-ranking employee at the NSA between 2001 and 2008, is accused of
illegally retaining classified information, obstructing justice and making false
statements.

Drake is alleged to have provided information to a newspaper reporter for a
series of articles published between February 2006 and November 2007.

The indictment did not identify the reporter, described only as "Reporter A," or
the "national newspaper" but various reports identified her as Siobhan Gorman of
The Baltimore Sun.

Gorman now works for The Wall Street Journal. The Baltimore Sun did not respond
to a request for comment from AFP.

The indictment also did not identify the subject of the stories, but said they
were "articles about the NSA and its intelligence activities, including SIGINT
programs."

NSA headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland, where Drake worked, is the main
facility for SIGINT, or Signals Intelligence programs, which involve capturing
and processing foreign communications for intelligence purposes.

Drake "served as a source for many of these newspaper articles, including
articles that contained SIGINT information," the indictment said.

Gorman wrote a number of articles about the NSA during the time period cited in
the indictment, including stories about problems with classified information
collection and analysis programs known as "Turbulence" and "Trailblazer."

According to the indictment, Drake left Fort Meade in 2006 to work at the
National Defense University in Washington but remained an NSA employee.

His security clearance was suspended in November 2007 and he resigned from the
NSA in April 2008.

Using Hushmail, a secure email service, Drake allegedly exchanged hundreds of
emails with "Reporter A" and they met on six occasions in the Washington area,
according to the indictment.

"This defendant used a secret, non-government email account to transmit
classified and unclassified information that he was not authorized to possess or
disclose," assistant attorney general Lanny Breuer said in a statement.

"He also later allegedly shredded documents and lied about his conduct to
federal agents in order to obstruct their investigation," Breuer said.

"Our national security demands that the sort of conduct alleged here --
violating the government's trust by illegally retaining and disclosing
classified information -- be prosecuted and prosecuted vigorously."

Drake faces five charges of illegally retaining classified documents, which
carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.

He faces one charge of obstruction of justice, which carries a maximum penalty
of 20 years in prison, and four charges of making false statements, which
carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison.

Lucy Dalglish, executive director of The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the
Press, told AFP the prosecution of a government leaker, while rare, is "not
unheard of."

"It's not a shock," Dalglish said. "They've always had the ability to charge
people with violating national security laws when they leak to a reporter. They
just don't typically do it very often."

She said the case is "designed to have an impact on leakers."

"It's going to impact people sharing information with reporters," she said.
