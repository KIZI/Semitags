The European Central Bank has no plans to bail out Greece and expects the
eurozone member to sort out its finances on its own, an ECB governing council
member said in an interview published on Monday.

"One has to be very clear: The ECB has no mandate or intention to take into
account the situation of a specific country, especially not with regard to
public finances," Ewald Nowotny told The Wall Street Journal.

"Our baseline scenario is that the Greek government will be able to fulfill its
promises," Nowotny, who is head of the Austrian central bank, said in an
interview conducted on Friday.

Greece's sovereign credit rating has been downgraded this month owing to its
growing public deficit and debt.

Greece's debt is now estimated at 300 billion euros (430 million dollars), three
times the size of Germany's, which is the biggest eurozone economy.

Athen's public deficit is likely to rise to 12.7 percent of output this year,
far exceeding the limit of 3.0 percent for countries that use the single
European currency.

The socialist government that was elected in October has unveiled austerity
measures which aim to reduce the deficit to 9.1 percent next year.

Greek Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou told lawmakers during a debate on
the 2010 budget on Sunday that the government would fix the country's "chaotic"
public finances and restore its international credibility.
