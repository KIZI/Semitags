In October, the Bears and Vikings played in Chicago. Bears won 48-41.

The NFL Sunday Night Game this week will be the Bears-Vikings in Minnesota. Should be a great game.
 
 
@wandeljw,

Particularly for Packer fans.
 
 
@Gargamel,

I think NBC will show the game, Gargamel. Let's see if we can spot Gus in the stands (before security carries him out).
 
 
@wandeljw,

just glad the Pates-Pitts game is not the sunday night game...
 
 
Because Green Bay lost last night, there is no longer a three-way tie for first in the NFC North. Sunday night's Bears-Vikings game will leave only one team in first.
 
 
The Sporting News predicts the Bears will defeat the Vikings 27-20. Their reasoning:
 
Kyle Orton is back and the Bears defense should shut down the Vikings offense.
 
 
 
@wandeljw,

It'll be much like the first meeting. Chicago's defense will not be able to stop Adrian Peterson and the rest of the Minnesota offense. If Kyle Orton is playing at 100 percent or thereabouts then Chicago's offense should be able to make up for Chicago's once vaunted, now mediocre defense. The loss of Defensive Coordinator Ron Rivera has negatively reflected on Chicago's defensive performance.
 
 
Tonight's game has been handicapped by the Las Vegas Review-Journal:

 
Chicago at Minnesota (-3): The winner will gain the sole NFC North lead, and we're taking the underdog. The Bears are playing much better and have the equalizer in rookie running back Matt Forte. The Vikings' Adrian Peterson has had some big rushing games against the Bears, but we give Chicago the coaching edge and we'll take the points.
