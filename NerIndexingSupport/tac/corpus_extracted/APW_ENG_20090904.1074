Seeking her third grand slam victory of the year, Serena Williams withstood a strong test from Maria Jose Martinez Sanchez of Spain 6-3, 7-5 to advance to the fourth round of the U.S. Open on Friday.

Williams overcame an early break in the second set and received a gift in the 11th game when Martinez Sanchez double-faulted twice in a row after the players reached deuce for the eighth time.

This was a rematch of a third-round meeting in the French Open, which Williams won in three sets. After that match, Williams said she hit a ball she thought went off her opponent's arm, and accused Martinez Sanchez of cheating by not acknowledging it.

Asked about that incident before this match, Williams once again said: "It hit her."

But there were no signs of animosity during their rematch on a cloudless, 80-degree (27-degree C) afternoon at Arthur Ashe Stadium.

Tenth-seeded Flavia Pennetta also moved, defeating Aleksandra Wozniak of Canada 6-1, 6-1.

The men's draw continued to go almost strictly to form, with No. 6 Juan Martin del Potro, No. 7 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga each winning in straight sets. With the third round nearly complete, none of the top 10 seeded men has lost a set.

"It was a quick match. I played great," Tsonga said after his 7-5, 6-3, 6-4 win over Finland's Jarkko Nieminen.

No. 16 Marin Cilic, from two sets down against American Jesse Levine, and No. 24 Juan Carlos Ferrero also won.

Martinez Sanchez is ranked 43rd in the world. Known mainly as a doubles player, the left-handed Spaniard offers a refreshing change of pace by playing almost all serve and volley. It made for a more difficult test for Williams, who had lost only seven total games in her first two matches.

Williams, seeking her fourth U.S. Open title, next meets 22nd-seeded Daniela Hantuchova, who defeated American Vania King 6-2, 6-2.
