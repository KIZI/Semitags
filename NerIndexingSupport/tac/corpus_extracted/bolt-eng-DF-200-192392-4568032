I don't really know how this works, I'm more curious as to how I'm perceived. So yeah, girls ( Not guys, come on fellas... let's not be gay. ) rate me!

I'm not insecure - far from it... after spending half of my childhood in a hospital so thank you very much.

F.y.i I am the idiot. I am the definition of mental retardation - I should be in one of those adverts, the guy that can't pour milk or peel a banana so he has to use some crap 3rd party item to help him achieve even a basic menial task.

Got it? Kay. Kay, stay clever folks. I got it covered.
 
 
Photo quality is atrocious.

of course you're not, thats why you had to put your pic on TSR asking girls to rate you

 
 
 
Your insecurity, attention seeking manner and rudeness is unattractive. Physically, you are alright, nothing to worry about except for the hairdo in the first pic.
 
 
you are not too bad

What the...
Chill bro

Getting back on track, you can't really see your face so no-one can truely make a judgement. Your dress sense seems fine though  
 
 
wannabe harry styles?
 
 
Didn't you post that photo yesterday asking about your dress sense...
 
 
You look stupid.
 
 
What's going on with the top right hand bit of your mirror in the first pic?  
 
 
You look... blurry.
 
 
Neater hair would be nice. Or not is fine. I like  
 
 
Well I can't really see your face so from what I can see I'm rating you 2/10. Simply because I hate your hair.
 
 
You just look like another too skinny white dude with a gay haircut. White girls dig that.
 
 
parents shouldve put you down at birth
 
 
I'm all for fluffy hair, but trim it please.
Then I'm on it like a car bonnet. seven.

on second thoughts, you seem a little psychotic.
 
 
OP you look fine, 7/10 a possible 8 if the picture wasn't blurry  
 
 
get a hair cut and you will be fine
 
 
You look like you have a cone on your head and someone dropped a mop onto that cone.
 
 
u look good, i dig curly hair so 7/10
 
 
 
wannabe harry styles?

 

aha exactly what I was thinking  
 
 
You look like that kid in Outnumbered...
 
 
Well, you are no Ansel Adams...
 
 
LOOK AT ME LOOK AT ME! LOVE MEE!

No.
 
 
I only see a picture of a brush, oh wait...
 
 
Definitely not my type at all. Could see some girls liking you though
 
 
You look cute
 
 
I wouldn't. Not my type. No I'm not gay  
 
 
Elbows too pointy...
 
 
It's hard to rate someone's looks when you post such blurry pictures. You're not by type, but I'm sure there's lots of girls that like your sort of look. i.e. from what I can see, you're not ugly.
 
 
Blurry pictures, and get a decent camera!

But...not that bad. 7/10   [Just get a trim!]
 
 
7/10. sh*t camera though >_>
but do not worry, i can help you with this - *grabs your camera and chucks it onto the floor repeatedly*

you're welcome  
 
 
I can take better pics with my calculator.  
 
 
7/10 (: ~ but get a hair cut
 
 
You look decent from what I can tell from the blurriness! I enjoy your hair. I'm not gonna give a number because I don't like that system
 
 
 
 
 
did you take those pictures on a calculator?
 
 
Can't see face  
 
 
 
wannabe harry styles?

 

Harry Styles? Who is he, all my girl mates are frothing over him

Here is the guy:

 

I think he is overrated, but hey to each their own.  
 
 
At least you've admitted it's you... a load of people on here say 'rate my friend'... like we can't tell it's them!  
You look ok, but smile! Smiling makes everyone look great. Also, I agree the photos are hard to see... do you have any better ones? People could make a more accurate judgment then.
And remember, image isn't everything. If you're nice on the inside, the people who care about you won't give a damn what you look like.
 
 
 
you're an ugly loser.
 
 
All I can tell from the first picture is that you have marge simpson's hair. That alone is enough to put anyone off.
 
 
 
Here is the guy:

 

I think he is very overrated, but hey to each their own.  

 

Yeah see what you mean. If he didn't have that bamffy hair no one would give a second look. Is he some boyband? I don't really keep upto date with the charts

Yeah he's in a boyband called One Direction which got to the finals of Xfactor last year. In fact I believe they are currently #1 on the UK music charts.....or maybe that was last week.

I like your hair  ...
 
 
Can't really see your face
 
 
How many times are you going to post the same pointless, blurry photo, it's getting a bit boring now.
