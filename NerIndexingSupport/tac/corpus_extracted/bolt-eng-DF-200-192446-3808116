 
 
Is it snowing where you are?
 
 
Just started snowing here   (North Leeds)
 
 
 
Just started snowing here   (North Leeds)

 

Ahh your lucky! Unfortunately no sign of snow for me
 
 
Not yet. I either want it to snow sufficiently for unis/schools etc to close or not at all. If it's just icy, I can't get there because it messes the transport up and there aren't busses that leave earlier enough for my 3 hour commute if they're any more than 10 minutes late, lol.
 
 
No   (Midlands)
 
 
Near Coventry; no.
 
 
Middlesbrough.. no snow yet.   That being said, I should probably hope there is no snow.. college buses run late enough at the best of times and the college only closed for one day last winter.
 
 
Cambridge (I should stress I am not normally here haha), not anything yet.
 
 
Edinburgh - seems to have snowed very lightly during the night. Pavements look a bit shiny and feel slightly slippy in parts, with obvious white coating of frost on car windscreens and grass.

And to think that this time last year the snow was so bad that the transport networks and some public sector operations were shut down entirely for a day or two.
 
 
London- no and it probably won't for aaaages so i get to do all my lovely end of term tests
 
 
Nope not snowing in Nottingham
 
 
Yep snowing here as well  
 
 
Hail/snow near stoke-on-trent
VERY windy too  
 
 
 
Just started snowing here   (North Leeds)

 

I live near and it's not snowing where I am.  
 
 
Surrey - nopeee  
 
 
Snow sucks, it just results in bad things.
 
 
Manchester...nope  
 
 
Snowed very lightly in Aberdeenshire last night, but by morning it was almost all melted. Still, lovely clear day.  
 
 
west mids- no snow
 
 
No sign of snow near Newcastle as of yet.
 
 
Near Manchester no snow.  
 
 
Nothing in Surrey. It's not even cold enough for a coat and gloves yet  
 
 
Peak Districts...no snow yet but we have been promised..
 
 
 
Peak Districts...no snow yet but we have been promised..

 

We had a few minutes worth on one side of Mow Cop before it turned to rain
 
 
Near York: unsurprisingly, no.
 
 
Nope, it's not really very cold here yet so it wouldn't stick even if it did (near Cardiff)  
 
 
Hertfordshire, nope.
 
 
Some light snow/sleet in Glasgow. Nice amount of snow on the surrounding hills so I suspect proper snowfall soon. So excited.  
 
 
 
Cambridge (I should stress I am not normally here haha), not anything yet.

 

ooh are you there for interview? Good luck!  

Anyway no snow in London.
 
 
In Aberdeenshire there is snow but not where I am in the shire (at the moment).
 
 
In Birmingham: No, and I hope not !!! There is a Christmas weekend away with my choir (nerdy hehe) that got cancelled last year because we couldn't actually drive there cos of how thick the snow was. It's this weekend coming, so please no snow!!!
 
 
Wrong thread!
 
 
 
Near Manchester no snow.  

 

I'm near manchester and it just chucked it down with hail, so now it looks like its been snowing a lot  
 
 
no snow on t'oxon/berks border, however i can hope  
 
 
No, thankfully (Cambridge).

I love the cold, but don't like snow. When it turns into ice on the pavement and I walk to school, my legs are akin to that of a baby giraffe learning how to walk.
 
 
Surrey - no.   I don't mind snow in the holidays, I hate it when it snows and I have to go to school. Firstly, I miss the day off and in sixth form I value my lessons, and second reason is that if school is on getting there is a nightmare and it becomes tedious. Saying that, when it's fresh snow it does look nice.
 
 
Nothing on Merseyside yet, just a lot of hail, wind and rain.
 
 
 
I'm near manchester and it just chucked it down with hail, so now it looks like its been snowing a lot  

 

  It always hails when I'm walking to school. Not when I set off from my house when I'm in the middle of my journey.  
 
 
No snow. A lot of rain though!
 
 
was light snow, more like sleet though and hail earlier.

I'm be guessing if I drove into the mountains near by it would be snowing rather heavy.

Im in eire
 
 
 
We had a few minutes worth on one side of Mow Cop before it turned to rain

 

Im just outside of Leek...still waiting for the snow though  
Now if it could snow enough that i cant get to uni in the morning that would be ace  
 
 
London, no. and I hope not until at least two weeks from now.
 
 
Sleet and hail but no snow yet.
 
 
Just rain in grey old London  
 
 
Nope, nothing..in London          
 
 
Ha... I wish! too much rain in Dublin at the moment  
 
 
It's always snowing in Canada.
 
 
 
Cambridge (I should stress I am not normally here haha), not anything yet.

 

Good luck with the interview  
 
 
Just rain and hail (very heavy, im battered from it) in Mersyside!
 
 
No snow in Glasgow, this is new   It tried to snow this afternoon for like ten minutes though.
 
 
In lancaster, it appears to be raining... Facebook tells me it was snowing before but..

Just looked out the window and I think it may be sleet now :P I JUST DON'T KNOW
 
 
In south lanarkshire (greater glasgow) been snowing all day, but hardly lay on the ground.
 
 
Exeter. No snow  

I demand snow and I want it now   make it happen God  
 
 
no snow in london, just grey rain and cold wind  

i love love love snow, i just hope it holds off until i finish for christmas cause its a pain in the bum trying to catch a train in the snow.
 
 
Rained for a bit in Preston,

I miss home   (I'm from Wakefield, like 10 minutes away from Leeds :P)
 
 
North Leeds here too. Was snowing at about 8.21 for about 10 minutes.
 
 
 
No snow where I live or in most parts of Norway. A lot of rain though!

 

i have snow and i live in norway. it started early this morning and i think we are now able to build an actual snowman   i hope the snow will still be there tomorrow, allthough my winterboots are damaged  
 
 
Itsnowhere to be seen where I am.
 
 
No snow   NI! My phone says it is 3 degrees, hmm maybe it'll decrease enough for snow.
 
 
Somerset - no snow...  
 
 
Wait what   *looks outside* phew no snow yet- east leeds  

It should snow tommorow though   I only like it when its fresh then it just becones slippy and a nuisance :\
 
 
I doubt it'll snow on the south English coast, where I am atm, but it'll probably happen when I go back home inland for my Christmas break.
 
 
We've got sleet in Keele.

I promise I wasn't outside my block dancing in my PJs and wellies with my flatmates and two of the girls in the block next door...

This. Just, this.  
 
 
There was snow this morning   It's just ice now though   I'm in Edinburgh.
 
 
No snow where I am in Ireland. I don't think we are due for snow either. No weather reports are saying we are due for snow.
 
 
There was some snowfall today, but the air wasn't cold enough for the snow to remain. Typical Western Norway.

Where in Norway are you?
 
 
Snow, cold what is this you speak of!? It is beginning of December and it is still warm-ish and sunny where I live (Portugal) XD

I am guessing that when the wind and rain come we are screwed though!
 
 
Sort of. Like, melted snow. Like very melted snow.

Actually, that's rain. Never mind.
 
 
Had a very odd dream about snow last night, but no, as far as I'm aware.
 
 
southampton- no snow

I actually don't live too far from Førde at the moment. I'm at a "folkehøgskole" on an island east from Stord.

wow that's really close   then you must have snow as well...?
are you norwegian or do you just study here?
 
 
Aberdeenshire (26 miles to the north east of the city), it's been snowing on and off all day. Just sheet ice now.
 
 
Nope (Bath)
 
 
I'm in the Appalachain Mountains of North Carolina and no snow, just cold ass weather. In a week I Will be going home to Perth, Australia where it is summer. As far as I'm concerned, the snow can suck it!
 
 
 
No sign of snow near Newcastle as of yet.

 

It snowed this morning! About 9am/10am, very short shower though.
 
 
 
wow that's really close   then you must have snow as well...?
are you norwegian or do you just study here?

 

Yup, I'm Norwegian. I graduated from videregående (upper secondary) last year, and am taking a gap year. I am originally from the Fosen penninsula outside Trondheim.

Since you live in Førde, I'll assume that you're Norwegian, because I doubt there are much study opportunities in Førde. Are you planning to study in the UK next year?

EDIT: It started snowing soon after I posted this! However, the snowfall ceased quickly, and there's hardly any snow on the ground.
 
 
Nope not here in Liverpool. Just a lot of rain, wind and hail though...

Hope it doesn't snow.
 
 
Nope  
 
 
South East London - Nope  
 
 
Haven't looked out of the window for the past few hours to check; main road not appealing. I just hope it doesn't wait until next week to do it when I need to get home.
 
 
Yes it was heavier earlier though, its still snowing but its very light-near glasgow.
 
 
 
Manchester...nope  

 

gunchestah, still nope.
 
 
Lancaster, no snow.
But tomorrow morning there WILL be three foot of snow outside my door and I will be unable to get the bus, right?
 
 
Nope no snow.

I must say that BBC weather is completely useless. According to them it should be 3C outside right now and that's the lowest it will go to tonight. Met office is saying that the lowest here will be 2C tonight.
Load of tosh. It's -3C outside. (We have a thermometer outside and I checked it 15 mins ago.. )

And it's forecast to rain at 3am.... This is going to be interesting...
 
 
I like the snow.I hope it continues for a while. This is it in my street.
 
 
Manchester nope, saw a few park cars with a bit of snow on them a few hours ago
 
 
I have literally just looked out my window and saw a sea of white, and it's pretty damn thick. Yay i feel dead christmasy now. Can't wait for my morning run in the snow!
 
 
nope - wolverhampton
 
 
Glasgow: yes. And I am PISSED.
 
 
 
Just started snowing here   (North Leeds)

 

I'm in North Leeds and that was hardly snow   Well I guess it was for about 10 minutes but it didn't settle or anything!  
 
 
Nope but we just had a lovely thunder storm here in Liverpool. I'm still trying to coax my sister out from under the table.
 
 
Heavy snow for 30 min in Leeds (West Yorks) then it stopped :/
 
 
I'm so jealous of people with snow! Everyone at uni in Leeds on my facebook posted about it a couple of hours ago   I'm in Norwich, nothing here.
 
 
Nope... It is damn cold outside though
 
 
no  
(wales)
 
 
Yes!!! I'm in Sheffield, it was snowing about half an hour ago!
 
 
NO.
 
 
Nothing in Denmark yet...forecasted for Tuesday and Wednesday though. It better had, or I will feel incredibly cheated!
 
 
Midlands- y u no snow?  
 
 
It was for a short while earlier in Bradford.

well, i am not norwegian, i am from germany. i am at my last year at vidergåande. yes i am planning to study in the UK   are you planning to do that as well? what exactly are you doing at fylkehøgskule?

well...When i woke up this morning, everything was covered with snow and i arrived at school, looking like a snowman/woman  
 
 
Yeh a few cm's here   (Dumfries, South scotland) wooohoo lol
 
 
It hailed this morning in Somerset. That's about it.  
 
 
Very weirdly - not in London.
 
 
no
 
 
Hertfordshire - no  
 
 
Snowing in Glasgow, not sure if I'm happy about this, last year I slipped on the ice so many times it's not even funny  
 
 
yesss! I am in Liverpool and it snowed just moments ago! but it stopped really quickly and the snow on the ground melted soon after! I love the first sign of snow each year! it really gets you in the christmas spirit!  
 
 
Couple of inches of snow just outside Glasgow  
 
 
Blizzard, ffs.
 
 
We have sleet at the moment in Sheffield
 
 
no but i wanna be back in leeds!
  my friend from uni kindly came online to tell me that its snowing up there last night  
booo!
i loves a bit of snow  ... though down here everthing comes to a stand still from a slight dusting, last winter we had plenty in leeds and everything was like normal... i dislike it when i try and go shopping and the shops are shut   if iv made it there in a corsa, noone else has any excuse! lol
x
 
 
 
yesss! I am in Liverpool and it snowed just moments ago! but it stopped really quickly and the snow on the ground melted soon after! I love the first sign of snow each year! it really gets you in the christmas spirit!  

 

Ah I'm right near Liverpool and nothing yet! I'd love uni to be snowed off just for the next two weeks, extra long Christmas break lol  .
 
 
For once I don't want it to, it's my first year driving and I don't like the thought of having to try to drive to work with no experience of driving in those kinds of conditions.  
 
 
Still no snow in manchester   I think it would be, but because its rainy too, its actually sleet and not proper snow.
 
 
 
Ah I'm right near Liverpool and nothing yet! I'd love uni to be snowed off just for the next two weeks, extra long Christmas break lol  .

 

that would be great! I am at halls on the central campus at uni and it only snowed for less than 5 minutes here. it was really loud and sounded like hail but it was white and definitely snow!  
 
 
 
Just started snowing here   (North Leeds)

 

Why don't you just watch the weather forcast?
 
 
Brighton- nope

well...When i woke up this morning, everything was covered with snow and i arrived at school, looking like a snowman/woman  

 

It's been snowing on and off through all of today actually!

What are you doing at videregående? (I did natural and mathematical sciences (realfag) with mathematics, chemistry and physics.) Have you studied here for through Vg1 and Vg2 as well or are you just an exchange student?

Førde is probably further from the coastline than Halsnøy, so that might be the reason for the huge amount of snow.

well i am at my last year and it's påbygg...har gått helse og sosial VG1 og barn og ungdom VG2. i've been in norway for almost 4 years now...i think...  
yeah i visited my parents today in askvoll and the snow isn't as bad as it is in førde, so you are probably right.
but i still don't know what you are doing at fylkehøgskule...?  
 
 
Aberdeen......no  .
 
 
London - nope  
 
 
I'm from Leeds, it snowed last night and then melted today

Live quite near, and I second that--> the snow was pathetic really, if it snows, I want it to snow well so we get an extra long xmas break! Otherwise Im not interested, lol I was so dissapointed...wanted to wake up to a winter wonderland.
Instead I woke up to sleet, slush and old man slipping on ice.
I didnt laugh.
Honest.

I knw, my dad helped him up though and we made him a cupppa so he seemed fine after that lol! Yep, it wasnt sunny hear just sleet and showers tbh But I really love the snow, only when it snows heavily though and the sledges come out lol! But yes, ice is horrible.
As the poor old man mr Jenkins from across the road found out today- quite painfully lol

aw that's really nice of you- making him a cup of tea   aw bless him! my dad's bought some of that special grit so it's my job to disperse it in the garden in the morning   so annoying.. i've never been sledging! have you? i need to go lol
 
 
Not a sausage in Bath, we've not even had a frosty morning really.

Back home (Derbyshire) got a little bit of snow though, I hear.
 
 
 
well i am at my last year and it's påbygg...har gått helse og sosial VG1 og barn og ungdom VG2. i've been in norway for almost 4 years now...i think...

but i still don't know what you are doing at fylkehøgskule...?  

 

I'm doing music. I didn't really want to study music at university, even though I am very interested in it. This was kind of a compromise actually, and something worthwhile to do whilst sorting out the paperwork.

We've had snow on and off all day. I love snow.   (Northern Ireland)
 
 
It just started snowing some 15 minutes ago. It's really wet snow, and I don't reckon it'll last long. But I'm loving it at the moment!

They sure are fast though. A snowplough drove past my window some 5 minutes ago.

No, and it better stay that way.

i want to study psychology and i am in the process of applying to some universities but things go a bit slow and i don't like that...i am a very impatient person  
which universities have you applied to?
 
 
Nope, but it's freezing. I really don't mind - I'd like the snow to hold off for the next two weeks so we can do the pantomime without any postponings - last year our December shows had to be postponed until mid-January because we all got snowed in.
 
 
In Oxford so pretty south so alas no snow :'(
 
 
No longer snowing. Just an ice rink instead.

Gonna have to go to uni in about an hour. I anticipate at least one embarrassing fall on my backside.

Bath (offer), Manchester (offer), Birmingham, Essex and Sheffield. You?
 
 
No it's just sunny but cold here!! I'm surprised we haven't had much bad weather yet  
 
 
Near Stansted - nada!
 
 
It's sleeting like it's turtles!
 
 
Clear blue skies down here in Surrey  
 
 
Essex...no  
It is freezing outside though
 
 
We've spent the last 48 hours or so alternating between hail and rain, in rapid succession.
 
 
No snow in Essex! So cold though!  
 
 
no, but we get hail in lovely liverpool..
 
 
It seems to be snowing everywhere in Nottingham apart from where I am. Good.
 
 
In Edinburgh it's been lightly snowing but it's predicted to get heavier in the next few weeks!
 
 
In Reading - no.

Freezing though.
 
 
Nope. It's very cold at the moment here in South London, but not snowing. Although it would be cool if it did snow, cos then I wouldn't feel as bad about being unemployed  
 
 
 
Bath (offer), Manchester (offer), Birmingham, Essex and Sheffield. You?

 

congrats to your offers  
i actually just want to apply to oxford brooks...but i guess i have to find some more...

What grades are you predicted in Videregående?
 
 
Who gives a ****?
 
 
We've got quite a bit   (Glasgow)
 
 
No, only just starting with a frost (Skegness, Lincs)
 
 
nope  
 
 
No snow in Sussex yet either.
 
 
Freezing my tits off at home doing my uni assignments!
 
 
 
What grades are you predicted in Videregående?

 

i don't know what i am predicted to get...i am going to apply with the grades from last year at barn og ungdom and they are pretty good it think gjennomsnitt of all my grades was 5,1 or something around that...don't remember  
 
 
Hampshire; no snow here yet

Woah, that's brilliant! I only had a mere 4.8. You have the grades to get into almost any university, except from the "Oxbridge" with these grades!  

You would need the grades from the third year as well though, because most universities require "generell studiekompetanse".
 
 
Yes, loads! Yesterday was worse though, it snowed all day non stop. I'm in the peak district.
 
 
Not snowing yet in Preston  
Knowing my luck it will start snowing next Friday when I'm due to go home for Christmas and prevent me from getting home! Though I do quite like the snow glistening everywhere, makes everything look so Christmassy!
 
 
Freezing in Chester, but no snow.
 
 
No snow here in Somerset yet, but we had one hell of a hailstorm at about 6.30 this morning. It was loud enough on the skylight across the hall to wake me up and when I looked outside it looked like it had snowed a bit.

yeah i know that, but these grades are only for getting a pre-offer or something like that...and when i have gjennomsnitt minst 4 at the end of this school year, then my pre-offer becomes a safe thing.
some of the subjects like english, samfunnsfag are subjects which i already have a grade on and i don't have these subjects this year...so that already safes me a 6 and a 5. i will also complete a grade in german this year, which will give me another 6...muhahaha ( i really don't mean to brag here...   ) but still, i am not good in norwegian, math and science which are subjects i have this year...so i am extremly worried and working very hard because of that...  
4.8 is great as well!! proud of you  
 
 
No snow in Northern Ireland, but hopefully some later

I scraped a 4 in German last year. Don't ask me how, because I have no idea; I can't speak German at all, really.
Norwegian is a subject I struggled with as well. (I assume you're exempted from "sidemål"). I got a 3 in the Bokmål examination, even though my teacher gave me a 5; I swear, those examinations are more like lotteries than anything else.

Take it easy. At least your sidemål is the most common one found in media according to the fact that you wrote "hovudmål" instead of "hovedmål". I cried a bit when I was selected for the Norwegian oral exam!   And the mandatory hovedmål exam is despicable.

Please don't be scared by my rants. I hate our country's education system on so many levels already.
 
 
Not at the moment - keep checking the forecast and it says snow, then none turns up.
 
 
Reading, nope and none forecasted for the next 5 days
 
 
No and thank god too! Don't need delays getting home!

eeehm...i don't really know which of those two words (hovudmål/hovedmål) is nynorsk or bokmål....but i am assuming hovudmål is bokmål...uaa anyway...i learned to write and talk in nynorsk...so bokmål is really a bit of a problem...well so is nynorsk, since i keep messing them up all the time xD
hey, i don't think you are ranting at all, although i am surprised that a norwegian actually hates the education system...haven't heard that before...

I thought nynorsk was your "hovudmål" since you lived in Førde. As a hint, Nynorsk is the one which reminds you most of how the locals speak.   Nynorsk is also the one which lazy spoilt brats from the Western part of Oslo is moaning about having to learn.

The issue with our education system is the fact that 60-70 % of what we're teached in the pre-university coarse (studiespes.) is core subjects, giving us a more shallow introduction to the subjects we choose in the second and third years. Because of my vision, I struggled to keep my average grade point up because I was exhausted after all the history and religion revision before the tests. Even though I have a 6 in the infamous R2-mathematics, I am only able to answer about half of the questions on a British Mathematics paper which is supposed to be on the same level. Hopefully I'll fill the gaps quickly enough whilst studying at university.
 
 
Yes it snowed 2 days ago.. snowed and now it's turned to solid ice. I nearly broke my neck trying to walk on it to get home! And more ice/gale winds have been forecasted for most of Scotland.

hahahah XD i know what you mean. when i first came to norway i couldn't believe what they were doing in math-classes...the things they learned in 10th grade, did we learn in 7th grade in germany...
wow but a 6 is sooo great! would love to have one myself   i think you will be perfectly able to fill the gaps at university...with a 6 in math you obviously love the subject  
yeah well nynorsk is my hovudmål...and i did notice they speak it here since i had to learn it to be able to communicate with the locals here...:P you did get me wrong there my friend :P

but since you are from near trondheim, you must somehow have your own language xD my friends keep telling me that the dialect spoken in trondheim is the worst of all  
 
 
yes it is.  

This is the view from outside my window at the moment:
 
 
 
 
yes it is.  

This is the view from outside my window at the moment:
 

 

  All I'm getting is rain.
 
 
 
yes it is.  

This is the view from outside my window at the moment:
 

 

Leicester?

Man I'm jealous, I want SNOW!
 
 
Nah, Bradford at the moment.
 
 
No. There's been hailstones, thunder and lightening for days and days.
 
 
None in Devon.

I want snow damn it!  
 
 
 
yes it is.  

This is the view from outside my window at the moment:
 

 

Is that Leicester? There's no sign of anything in Nottingham!!  
 
 
No, Uni doesn't finish 'till tomorrow (meaning I finish term with all-day labs) so I'm still in Bradford at the moment.

To my great disappointment the groundskeeper has been a boring person and shovelled it all away.
 
 
No, thank god. I need it to stay away until after the 21st... and then it has to go away again on the 28th.
 
 
It has been snowing here for the past month or so.
 
 
None in Durham. I don't want any either.   I've still got two full days of classes and I am desperate to go home. This 13/14 week term has left me shattered, so I didn't really want to get snowed in lol.
 
 
It never snow here and it will never happens here. Its always super hot here and I never touched snow.
 
 
I wish! Apparently there will be some tomorrow. Snow is a must for Christmas time for me. It's not the same without it.
 
 
in manchester city center and its not

its expected to snow
 
 
In North Ayrshire and its just freezing. I hate snow anyway and I hate people who like it. Its cold and wet, everything slows down or shuts down and old people die in it!!!! But the retard snow lovers just go "but look how pretty it is   "
 
 
Its snowing here in Basingstoke!!!!!        
 
 
Snow up on the hills... some of my mates think the clouds wil tumble from the hills causing SNOW
 
 
no  
all surrounding towns have heave snow we just have rain. typical bedford.
 
 
no it never snows in bangladesh but the temperature has gone so low this time i wonder how cold it would be in countries where it snows!  
the temperature is only 18 degree celcius here and i can't take it.  
 
 
It's snowing properly where I am now. It's lovely at the moment because it's not bad enough to mess anything up. Give it a couple of hours and I'm sure we'll all be complaining wishing it'd just go away again.
 
 
it's just started snowing in london!!!! sort of sleety, but heavy sleet!
 
 
Dublin. It snowed a bit, but very little!! there's just a bit of white.
 
 
Yep, it's just started snowing today - first time in ages! Well, it's not settling though because the ground is wet, but at least it's a start  
 
 
snowing here (east London)
 
 
No and I hope it stays that way - cycling is my only real way of getting around.
 
 
Finally started snowing here this morning  

Took my little one to school and when we got there all his classmates were just stood in the window watching it fall   It was so sweet.

Now it feels like Christmas  
 
 
No Manchester is snowingg
 
 
Had some heavy snow this morning (surrey) too wet to settle though  
 
 
YEAHHHHHHHHHHH!   in north wales! however, it isn't sticking!
 
 
It started here less than half an hour ago  
 
 
Its was 2 hours ago XD IN MANCHESTER
 
 
I'm in Russia atm and it's been snowing for a few months now! I'd quite like there not to be any snow when I get home to London!
 
 
Yes Hampstead London!!
 
 
It snowed but its not cold enough to settle and plus it rained  
 
 
Not snowing here in Aberystwyth, but it is snowing back home in Chester, apparently. Going back home for the Christmas break tomorrow, so looking forward to that! Hope it sticks :P
 
 
In London, no.

Oh wait, some areas of London - yes.
 
 
Nope. Here in Solihull/Birmingham there hasn't even been a suggestion of any snow, just a bit of rain last night.
 
 
It was snowing but now it is not  
 
 
Near Liverpool, yes but it's not really sticking.

Yah it was (North London). I was watching it from the window whilst doing English Coursework  
 
 
Not in Norwich.
 
 
Yes in Preston. But it's dying down now compared to this morning.
 
 
North East Essex - yes! but only a little bit, and it's not settling.
 
 
Keele is like the North Pole! It started around 10:30 and it's not stopped  
 
 
Bolton- lovely light snow that isnt really sticking to the ground to much. The first snow isnt bad but when it freezes over, oh dear   and I write this from college, so we're not closed!  
 
 
Lancaster, was this morning.
 
 
Its not snowing atm, but there's still some on the ground.  

Edit: It's snowing again.  
 
 
Was sleeting today morning in London...

Edit: in Camden town btw.

Snowed in the morning (manchester)
 
 
Was snowing early this morning. Now there's no sign of it  
 
 
Been snowing since 7 very heavily, it hasn't stopped once yet. Bus couldn't even get all the way home from school so had to walk for an hour getting soaked! D:
 
 
Yes!  
 
 
 
Decided to go out and get a few better pictures;

 

 

 

those are wallpaper worthy  
 
 
There wasn't any while I was in Ealing and Brentford, and hasn't been so far in Hove. But I have an inkling it will be some time this weekend either in Hove or Ealing/Brentford.
 
 
It snowed this morning, whilst I was in RE, but it didn't stick. [Thankfully.]
 
 
Apparently it snowed during my Physics mock exam today. My friend was the only facing the window and she happened to look up and see it, but when we walked out of the building after finishing the paper, there were big shallow puddles, and it was drizzling.  
 
 
It was this morning.

But the snow didn't settle.
 
 
Feel like Leeds is the only place it hasn't snowed!  
 
 
No, thank god.. I don't want to drive in snow.
 
 
It snowed until the middle of the afternoon today. The skies are set to be clear tonight without it being too cold.
 
 
=( No snow in austria, Graz yet  .

Hate it. I want snow.
 
 
London: we got a bit but it didn't settle.
 
 
 
Then you'll really like this one   ;

 

 

*Breaks out into a bad rendition of Let it Snow.*

Thank you for making my day so much better!            
 
 
Bristol- now snow for me! At least by now... I really wanted it to snow in Christmas, though!  
 
 
Yep.. in the morning and mid-afternoon.. In Bolton.. But it wasn't heavy tho..  
 
 
 
*Breaks out into a bad rendition of Let it Snow.*

Thank you for making my day so much better!            

 

I'm glad  
 
 
I had a rather long train journey today
- Only snow on high ground in Bristol
- No snow before we were north of Birmingham
- Thick & fast between Stafford and Stoke
- Petering out as we got towards Macclesfield and Cheadle Hulme
- Nothing in Manchester - I suspect it was too wet because of the urban heat island (essentially heat escaping from buildings) melting any potential snow
 
 
......
 
 
 
In Oxford so pretty south so alas no snow :'(

 

Im in Oxfordshire too, but im glad there has been no snow as of yet; weve had too much of it over the last 3 years imo  
 
 
Heck no, it is not and has not been this 'winter'. Have not experienced winter for two years now...  
 
 
Snow?!
It's fricking sunny where I am. God just hates my town. :[
 
 
About an hour ago, I took a walk with my york-terrier, he was in snow up to his neck. And it was rather difficult for him to find the place to make a toilet. He doesn't make it on the roads, so he had problem to find another place with not so deep snow. And at previous week TV told me about my location, as if there will be - 26 at the middle of January.
