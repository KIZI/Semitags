The International Criminal Court said Wednesday it has reported Sudan to the U.N. Security Council for refusing to arrest a government minister and a militia leader suspected of war crimes in Darfur.

Judges at the court said in a report that Sudan has refused to hand over Humanitarian Affairs Minister Ahmed Harun and Janjaweed militia leader Ali Kushayb.

"After taking all possible measures to ensure the cooperation of the Republic of the Sudan, the Chamber concludes that the Republic of the Sudan is failing to comply with its cooperation obligations," the report said.

The court ordered the men arrested in 2007 on a total of 51 charges of crimes against humanity and war crimes.

The report says the Security Council can now "take any action it may deem appropriate."

The report was published a day before Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir is expected to be inaugurated for a new term in office.

Al-Bashir also is wanted by the court for allegedly masterminding atrocities in Darfur.

Sudan is not a member of the world's first permanent war crimes tribunal and al-Bashir has repeatedly said he refuses to cooperate with it or hand over suspects.

Human rights groups have urged nations to boycott his swearing-in to underscore their commitment to international justice.

The Security Council ordered the International Criminal Court to launch its investigation into crimes committed in Darfur, where al-Bashir's Arab-led government has been battling ethnic African rebels since 2003. Up to 300,000 people have been killed and 2.7 million have been driven from their homes.
