I might add a mother interrupted is Susan Detlefson who was a part of the
LAKE case too and she is very close to Leonard and AFRA members Lake and her
child appeared on Mother Interrupted's cable public access show in Oregon
when they were here not smart if you ask me but just MHO. She is also very
close to and works regularly with the GAstons and their group as well as
Roger Weidner.

Dear Ron,

I assume that you were replying to my post.  If I assume incorrectly,
forgive my assumption.

Perhaps the confusion lies in the word affiliate.  It does have a  definition
in the business world and in fact, the definition leaves little room  for
misunderstanding.

af·fil·i·ate /v. əˈfɪliˌeɪt; n. əˈfɪliɪt, -ˌeɪt/ Pronunciation Key -
Show Spelled  Pronunciation[v. uh-fil-ee-eyt; n. uh-fil-ee-it, -eyt]
Pronunciation Key - Show IPA Pronunciation verb, -at·ed, -at·ing, noun
–verb (used with object)
1. to bring into close association or connection: The research center is
affiliated with the university.
2. to attach or unite on terms of fellowship; associate  (usually fol. by
with in U.S. usage, by to in Brit. usage):  to affiliate with the church.
3. to trace the descent, derivation, or origin of: to affiliate a
language.
4. to adopt.
5. Law.  to fix the paternity of, as an illegitimate child: The mother
affiliated her child upon John Doe.
–verb (used without object)
6. to associate oneself; be intimately united in action or  interest.

7. a branch organization.
8. Commerce.      a. a business concern owned or controlled in whole or
in  part by another concern.     b. a subsidiary.
9. a person who is affiliated; associate; auxiliary.

I did not mean to upset you, analyze you or pick you  apart.  I wish you only
the best success on your journey.  By the way,  I did send you a condolence
if only by e-mail.  What you define as a  lack of help on my part to you was
instead my own discernment about getting into  association with some people who
I know had harmed other members and,  perhaps their families.  I feel that you
are saying you have found  me worthless because I didn't step up to help with
your  rally.   It wasn't intentional.  You probably don't realize how  busy I
truly am.

Please forgive me, I am not upset that I didn't sell any  T-shirts.  It
wasn't my intention to sell any.

I really don't see people here trying to tell you what to  do.  Instead, I
think they are trying to help members so they too won't be  harmed.

Best wishes,
effie

The organizations that you point out are  organizations who came to the
website just as you did and registered as an  organization.T  If you register does
that make you a partner of  mine?  You too could have sold DC Rally T Shirts
with your emblem on them  if you supported the rally.  I sold no T Shirts.  I
am not in the T  Shirt business. However, if you designed and had T Shirts to
sell they could have been made available on that website.  You guys  have much
too much time on your hands.
