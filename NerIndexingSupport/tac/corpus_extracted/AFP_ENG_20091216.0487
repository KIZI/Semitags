Amara Traore has been appointed Senegal coach, the Senegalese football
federation (FSF) announced on Wednesday.

The 44-year-old former player has coached first division ASC Linguere de St-
Louis since 2007, leading them to the title this season.

The FSF added that their immediate aims were qualification for the 2012 African
Nations Cup and the Olympic Games.

Senegal have failed to qualify for both the 2010 African Nations Cup in Angola
and the World Cup finals in South Africa.
