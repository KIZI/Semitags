Burundi's opposition groups said Friday they will boycott the July 23
parliamentary elections because their demands for free polls have not been met.

The 12-member Democratic Alliance for Change (ADC) want the release of their
members they say have been arbitrarily arrested, an end to torture of political
detainees by police and the secret service and freedom of movement.

"As long as these conditions are not met, we will not go back to the electoral
process," Alexis Sinduhije, an ADC leader, said on the last day for registration
of parliamentary election candidates.

Burundi's main opposition parties pulled out of the presidential elections last
month claiming that local council elections held in May were riddled with fraud.

Their boycott of the June 28 elections left incumbent President Pierre
Nkurunziza as the only candidate. He won nearly 92 percent of the votes.

Sinduhije said the bloc wanted "a postponement of the legislative elections for
dialogue in order to set up a commonly agreed electoral commission and the
organisation of a proper electoral process."

Burundi embarked on a series of elections in May -- its second post-war poll
process -- that were seen as crucial to cementing a fragile peace process and
boosting democratic credentials.

But a series of grenade attacks and the opposition boycott have tainted the
process in a country emerging from the ravages of an ethnically-driven civil war
that erupted in 1993.
