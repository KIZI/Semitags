By PHILIP ELLIOTT and HOLBROOK MOHR

SHREVEPORT, La.  Sharon Bialek's former boyfriend said Monday the then-couple spent an evening with Herman Cain in the 1990s. That countered the GOP presidential candidate's earlier statements that he never met the woman who has accused him of inappropriate sexual behavior more than a decade ago.

"Sharon indeed did meet and spend time with Mr. Cain," Victor Jay Zuckerman said.

In turn, Cain's attorney, Lin Wood, insisted that his client "doesn't recall Ms. Bialek."

Zuckerman, a Louisiana pediatrician, corroborated some of Bialek's story  with attorney Gloria Allred at his side  just as the firestorm around Cain seemed to be subsiding since the first disclosures on Oct. 30 rocked Cain's campaign. There hadn't been any new information disclosed in the past week about Cain or the accusations, and plans for a joint news conference by his accusers seemed increasingly unlikely.

But, on Monday, Zuckerman echoed Bialek's account of the two of them meeting Cain  and spending the evening with him  in Chicago in 1997 at the National Restaurant Association convention. He said that Cain then invited them to an after-dinner party in a hotel suite.

"At that party, Mr. Cain engaged both of us in conversation," Zuckerman said.

Later that year, Zuckerman said, Bialek told him that Cain inappropriately touched her when, at Zuckerman's suggestion, she met him in Washington to seek employment help.

"When she returned, she was upset," Zuckerman said. "She said that something had happened and that Mr. Cain had touched her in an inappropriate manner. She said she handled it and didn't want to talk about it any further."

This shit is old. You need to move on to your next victim.
 
 
You do realize that someone who hasnt seen anything of relevance isn't a witness that's going to escalate things right?

Nope, we haven't finished off Herman yet...
 
 
Unless Herman Cain raped anybody, he still has my vote.

exactly... he saw nothing, and it is just more hearsay.

The media should be ashamed of themselves!

He want a book deal too
 
 
Cain denies he ever met Sharon Bialek. This witness confirms that he did. Can Cain produce a witness that says he never met either of them? I would guess there were other people at that party who would also remember Sharon Bialek.
 
 
Herman Cain. He's so manly that when he runs a train on the ladies it's only one man involved.

The Cain Train.
 
 
Haven't you heard? Herman Cain is the anti-Christ!

 Herman Cain is the Anti-Christ!!! 
 
 
ZOMG, Cain can't provide witnesses that he didn't meet George and Martha Washington, either. That proves he molested Martha on a carriage ride to Mount Vernon.  
 
 
 
Haven't you heard? Herman Cain is the anti-Christ!

 Herman Cain is the Anti-Christ!!! 

 

No, Herman is too dumb to be the anti-Christ.
 
 
Not sure if there is much value to this. He just confirms she's been telling this story for a while.

There are so many better reasons to reject Cain.

Nope, we haven't finished off Herman yet...

 

Thanks for making your despicable motives so blatantly obvious.

He said he doesn't remember meeting her. The witness confirms nothing aside from the fact that he's another lib liar who has absolutely no scruples.

He said he didn't remember meeting her, so I understood. There is a difference between denying you've met someone and not remembering meeting them. I've met thousands of people in my life that I would not recall meeting. Shocking.

Your petty lies about Cain are bordering on obsessional. Hate the black or hate the conservative? Or is it just because he happens to be a black conservative that is so offensive? His drapetomania upsets you?

No... in this case, its a media hit job!

 
 
 
Yeah I'd probably have trouble remembering one of the endless women I've come onto inappropriately to. When there's a sea of them out there, it's hard to remember the individuals!
 
 
 
Herman Cain. He's so manly that when he runs a train on the ladies it's only one man involved.

The Cain Train.

 

Be honest - you spent all day thinking that one up, didn't you?
 
 
I just wish we could all get along...
 
 
 
Yeah I'd probably have trouble remembering one of the endless women I've come onto inappropriately to. When there's a sea of them out there, it's hard to remember the individuals!

 

But, but, there are thousands that he didn't...

I wish you'd stop lying. We don't always get what we want.
 
 
 
Yeah I'd probably have trouble remembering one of the endless women I've come onto inappropriately to. When there's a sea of them out there, it's hard to remember the individuals!

 

Maybe he doesn't remember her because nothing inappropriate happened? He said. She said. You believe her because you want to. There is not evidence to support her allegations. But don't let a lack of actual evidence get in the way.... I mean, he's black, he's conservative.... of course he's in the wrong. Right?

Moo-ron.

With that comment, I think he's some kind of serial molester of epic proportions.
 
 
Strange those most vocal about accusing Cain have some very shady financial pasts. First Sharon with two bankruptcies, a paternity suit filed against her and 9 jobs in 17 years. Now we have Zuckerman with his own bankruptcies, lawsuits, IRS liens, and gambling problems.

 
Judge Popejoys decision reformed the lease in question and awarded $187,657.00 in damages jointly and severally against Stratford Pediatric and Dr. Victor Zuckerman (Zuckerman), the principal physician in that practice.

On September 2, 2010, Stratford Center served a citation to discover assets on Chase Bank. Both Stratford Pediatric and Zuckerman banked at Chase. Under Illinois law, the service of the citation created a lien on Stratford Pediatrics and Zuckermans accounts. 735 ILCS 5/2-1402(m)(2). On September 12, 2010, Chase responded to the citation by producing bank statements and identifying several accounts held by Stratford Pediatric and Zuckerman. These statements identified $10,117.49 held in Stratford Pediatrics accounts and $47,507.60 held in Zuckermans accounts.

In May 2010 (after the bench trial, but before the judgment was entered) Stratford Pediatric sold its assets to Central DuPage Hospital for $333,000.00 in cash. This money was mostly transferred to Zuckermans personal accounts. He soon went on a gambling and day trading spree and lost all of the money. In July 2010, Zuckerman moved to Louisiana. On September 15, 2010, Zuckerman filed a chapter 11 petition in the Western District of Louisiana. His creditors include, among others, Stratford Center (with claims of $675,000.00), his ex-wife (with claims of $89,000.00), and the IRS (with claims of $50,000.00).

I don't believe her because she says he tried to rape her ( forcing her head down into his crotch and shoving his hand up her skirt) and her response was not to yell, Get the hell off of me!" but "I have a boyfriend'.

If the CEO of a company tried to rape me, I would be off to the cops, and perhaps even file a lawsuit. She says all this happened and she did not say anything because she no longer worked for the company. Cops don't care if you do not work for a company if you have been sexually assaulted.

What does him being black have anything to do with it? Projecting much?

Moo-ron. I like that. Very clever. Did you think of it yourself?
 
 
Bialek last week: I told my boyfriend what happened but I didnt give him any details.
Zuckerman this week: She told me what happened but didnt give me any details.

 
 
 
Bialek- I was broke, then I lied and got on TV. Now I have money and I'm infamous!!
Zuckerman - I want some a that Obama money!! I'll lie too!!!

By "old" you apparently mean "earlier today." Bialek's ex JUST came forward.
 
 
He actually cracked me up today.

 
He said former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who is often perceived as boring, is "just plain vanilla." Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who has stumbled in his campaign after being the frontrunner in late August shortly after his campaign started, was "rocky road." When asked about Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.), he said, "Michele Bachmann... I'm not going to say it. I'm not going to say it." When pressed again, he said, "Tutti-frutti. I know I'm going to get in trouble!"

LOL!

"Cain was also asked by GQ what you can tell about a man by the kind of pizza he likes. "The more toppings a man has has on his pizza, I believe the more manly he is," he said. However, he said a pizza "piled high with vegetables" was "sissy pizza."

But I LIKE veggie pizza...

sausage, sausage, sausage...

grrrr, I am repped out for the day...
 
 
No worries.  

Mr. Cain sure does make everybody have pizza on the brain (even if it's most assuredly NOT Godfather's.)

Woo buddy, you people are BRILLIANT!

BUYALICK! Look at that! And the Moo-ron before you by California Girl.

Amazing. Another financially impaired "I'm not in it for the money" witness!!

And interesting that the press conference was held at the Friar's Club? Hidden meaning?

Of course...it's a sick joke...courtesy of the left.
 
 
 
 

 

Quite tame when it came to what the left said of Tripp, Jones, Lewinski, Flowers, Juanita Broaddrick, and then some took from the left...

He didn't try to rape her, he stopped when she objected.

And yes, saying "I have a boyfriend" is a pretty standard response when someone is coming on to you that you aren't attracted to. Works 9 times out of 10.
 
 
She had to read her statement from a written copy provided by Gloria Allred. She had no idea what she was supposed to say.
