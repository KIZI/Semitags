Tottenham midfielder Tom Huddlestone needs surgery on his right ankle and will be sidelined until February.

The 23-year-old England international will miss the rest of Tottenham's Champions League group games, as well as a host of Premier League matches, including Saturday's north London derby at Arsenal.

Tottenham is already without striker Jermain Defoe and defenders Michael Dawson, Ledley King and Jonathan Woodgate.

A statement on the club's website on Monday said the decision to send Huddlestone for surgery was taken after consulting several specialists.
