A plea to the American League

Most of America HATES the New York Yankees,
and was enormously pleased earlier this season
when the Yankees were nowhere near contending.
But now they've come alive again, so I offer, on
behalf of baseball fans everywhere (except New
York), the following pleas to all AL teams
other than the Yankees:

1) If you're playing against the Yankees, please win.
2) If you're a serious wild-card contender, please
win.  (If two contenders, neither of them the Yankees,
are playing each other, then I suppose I have to root
for the one with a better chance of beating the
Yankees for the wild card.)
3) If you're the Boston Red Sox, for God's sake win!
A howl of agony would arise from all America if
the Yankees bite you in the butt and steal the
division from you at the end of the season.

And the Tigers won "tonight" (early this morning I should say) ;)
Are they members of rec.sports.baseball ?
