I Think the question says it all! Where is Earth's Best City! Submit any city you think qualifies as the best and at the end we will decide if you could visit one city before you die which would be it. Well the name you submit can be in different categories like Architecture, Modernism, Conservationism, Fashion, Style, and more!     and yup reply only if you are serious :P

London, Obviously
 
 
Hmmm interesting question. Obviously I'm only able to pick from cities I've been to, Barcelona was fantastic for culture and architecture and I guess a lot of people are going to say New York which is great but I thought Boston was better.

In short my vote would probably go to Barcelona.
 
 
Yup I thought London Too but when checking for it on the internet i get Barcelona or New York at Top! There is something at Barcelona but what is New York! I Think only the Rich can experience full potential of New York!

Lahoree ahhahhaha

I dnt know bcoz I havent been to many- but NYC looks quite nice too :P
 
 
What are you, an alien?
 
 
of the ones i have been to, Barcelona

london's good in terms of infrastructure and economy and education, yes. But you need more than that to be a great city. Spend a week in Barca and then a week in London, see which is better for quality of life. I know where i'd rather live personally.
 
 
 
What are you, an alien?

 

Yup You Can Say That! :P
 
 
2 Votes barcelona, 2 London, 1 New York, 1 are you an alien!  
 
 
I can't choose one! Um....out of places I've been to...Cologne, Auckland, or Sorrento.
 
 
hmmm... but b4 death we cant visit so manyy!

Not true. New York has things for everyone.

It is by far the best city in the world. All the hype is not just there for no reason.
 
 
New York.
 
 
Hmm...
 
 
Seoul.
 
 
bangor is wayyy-alllssss.
 
 
vegas
 
 
Cities are dull concrete blocks.
 
 
I'm going to pick a funny one here and say Valletta in Malta   Small, some stunning architecture, surrounded by history, great restaurants, views and weather.  

 
 
 
 
Stockholm. So beautiful.

 
 
 
53°24′n 2°59′w
 
 
Edinburgh.
 
 
Geneva.

Also, a place called rudesheim, not a city; but still beautiful. ^.^
 
 
London
 
 
There are so many I can think of but I don't know if anyone would agree. I like London, Paris and Boulder, CO. I'm not sure if it's a town or a city but it's lovely (and full of hipsters. We actually saw one guy sat in the street with a typewriter.)
 
 
Berlin, spent 4 months in my German teacher's flat (she wasn't there obv) and doing bar work, had a ****ing blast. The nightlife was great and the people were friendly and patient.

NYC, similar to the above I was doing menial work to support myself but still had a ball, the music scene is thriving and there are so many things to do, the conversationism isn't as good as LDN but the parks are still pretty nice.

Going to a city for a week or two isn't enough time to gauge how good it is, you have to scrape by, struggle to support yourself and search out people and entertainment in order to gain a complete experience. I had no choice because I'm from a working class background but if any of you middle class (or higher) people choose to go to another city then I implore you to spend time supporting yourself, it's fulfilling as hell.
 
 
Florence
 
 
Sydney, I have seen quite a few of the 'big' cities (New York, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Paris, Tokyo, London, Dubai..) and I have to say it was the most friendly, beautiful and clean of them all also seemed to be least congested and close to lovely beaches. That said there are a lot of smaller, yet great cities but I'll keep this to the big ones that everyone knows. I really like some Scandinavia's cities but they don't really register on the world map

edit- my top 5

1. Sydney
2. San Francisco
3. New York
4. London
5. Paris
 
 
Cologne. I was there in the easter holidays and it is beautiful!
 
 
Romford
 
 
I love London.

But actually I'd have to say Cairo. It felt so alive, even though I spent but a short time there. Western cities feel so sterile and dull in comparison.
 
 
I love NYC  
 
 
I love London, New york, Valencia, San Francisco, Paris, Kandy(Sri lanka), edit: how could i forget Hong Kong and Tokyo!
 
 
Helsinki.

Especially with snow  
 
 
I vote Tokyo ^_^
 
 
Los Angeles would be my favourite out of those which I've visited   Not that I've visited many...  
 
 
Edinburgh!

And I'm not just saying that cos I'm from there. It really is a beautiful city, and the festival is really fun.
 
 
London.

Then New York.
 
 
San Francisco!
The epicentre of activism, hippie culture, the alternative art scene, rock and roll, the beautiful west coast scenery... ahhh...
 
 
New York City by a long way. It's so much better than London it's amazing. About the only thing London has over NYC is History. Las Vegas is also amazing to visit but it's not somewhere you'd want to live.
 
 
Edinburgh  

- Largest performing arts festival in the world, largest book festival in the world, largest comedy festival in the UK, and about 12 other festivals including a Film Festival where Toy Story 3 had it's world premier (ie. outside of USA).
- Highest density of listed buildings in the UK.
- Second highest GDP per capita in the UK (after London).
- Highest percentage of pupils attending Private Schools in the UK (and that is from someone who didn't go private, in Edinburgh private schools are better in at least the academic sense)
- Some of the greatest people in history are attributed to Edinburgh, from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to JK Rowling, Alexander Graham Bell to Peter Higgs (Higgs Boson).
- Second most popular tourist destination in the UK (after London).
 
 
Dubai. Beautiful landscapes, architecture, shops - you name it

I agree with almost everything you said here ( I love The Burgh!)

But seriously how does the private school thing make it a good city?  
I personally feel that it's one of the city's bad points. Since a disproportionate amount of children (1 in 4) go to private schools in Edinburgh I think this leads to the state schools doing less well. It also means there's a lot of holier than thou private school attitude in Edinburgh.

Disclaimer: I know a lot of privately educated people AREN'T remotely snobby, but as a generalisation...
 
 
London!  
 
 
Edinburgh
 
 
I read somewhere that Melbourne has the highest standard of living. I'd personally prefer to live in New York.
 
 
 Top 29 Best Cities 

I don't care if I'm a woman, I love askmen.com. It's so full of useful crap.
 
 
My favourite city to visit is a toss up between Berlin, San Diego or Barcelona.

My favourite city to live in is Liverpool, the people are friendly, the city is big enough so that you're not bored but small enough to walk around.
 
 
Sydney. Stunning city
 
 
Talking as someone who has been to Sydeny, London, New York, LA, Tokyo, Seoul and Shanghai all in the last 5 years i would say Shanghai if you like modern architecture and helpful people but if you like seeing sites and shoping New York is a defo. My 'BEST CITY' however is Seoul but that could be due to me going with friends not family (and being able to drink, unlike in the USA)
 
 
From where I've been to? Madrid... probably. Es una ciudad muy bonita.

In the world, Melbourne, Vancouver, Toronto, Stockholm and Zurich probably vie for the top few places. I completely disagree that London should be anywhere near the top 50.
 
 
Fallujah or Perth Australia.

I don't think it MAKES it a good city, its more of an indicator of one. Private schools are businesses which are dependant on customers, ie. rich folk. If a city has a large enough percentage of rich folk to support so many private schools then that surely is an indicator of prosperity?  

 
I meant to + rep you but negged instead, sorry.

 

That's fine, although your mighty rep has decimated mine! :P
 
 
Paris évidemment.
 
 
Well There are many Suggestions now! Hmm...
 
 
Okay, so most would consider NY 'best' city. Since Pittsburgh has been rated No. 1 most livable city in the US (no - not by the Pittsburgh Post), it is clear that Pittsburgh is the best city in the world. Follow the logic?
 
 
Bolton
 
 
 
Baghdad; the city is booming...quite literally.

 

Yup! I am a Abbasi and I Think Baghdad must be great!

Are these people insane? Rating Miami ahead of New York? New York has broadway, and tons of museums to satisfy culture junkies. Miami is great if you want to get drunk and party every night, but it's a bit of a culture vacuum. I guess there criteria is figuring out where the best places to party and get laid are  
 
 
It's really down to personal preference, but I would have to say London is my favourite city that I have visited.
 
 
Out of New York, Sydney, Vancouver, Chicago, Tokyo and Rome for me
 
 
Anywhere in South/West Wales!  
 
 
Hong Kong!
 
 
London or New York
 
 
 
Paris évidemment.

 

Exactement. Including some of the suburbs as well, Vaucresson, Garches, Sevres, Saint Cloud.

Otherwise Edinburgh.
 
 
São Paulo <3 errr Barcelona and Osaka  
São Paulo (mainly for personal reason but)

las vegas you have a billion beaches or countries or places like spain barcelons etc but u only have 1 vegas  
 
 
Kathmandu, the cultural difference was overwhelming.
 
 
I love Rome
 
 
The world's greatest city is Hong Kong.

 
End of discussion.
 
 
Edinburgh, Hangzhou or Amsterdam:

 

 

 
 
 
hong kong.!

Either Las Vegas, Melbourne or Vancouver.
 
 
1) Zurich, Switzerland.
2) Hong Kong.
3) Singapore.
4) Seattle, WA USA.
5) Amsterdam, Netherlands.
 
 
Vancouver.
 
 
This is kind of a dumb thread because people are just listing the best cities they have been to and no one is able to visit every city.

It isn't very liveable (unless you enjoy floods and eye wateringly expensive real estate)
 
 
Laaaaaaandan.

Well, I suppose it depends on what you're looking for. Personally, I prefer London to New York, but I also love Berlin. Each to their own.
 
 
Sydney

True; my nomination was probably motivated more by the somewhat frivolous overtones of others' contributions than by any meaningful assessment of social infrastructure, economic prosperity or general habitability. But who wants to see photographs of Seattle?
 
 
In the UK; I like Edinburgh and Bristol, London is a world city but I'm not convinced it is very liveable. Outside of the UK - I love Berlin (which is hugely underrated), it has a great cultural scence, is reasonably priced, it oozes history and you will have trouble getting bored. Loads of the Scandanavian cities are liveable - but they fall short on how interesting they are to live in. In terms of being seats of power/finance - NYC, Paris, Tokyo, London, Hong Kong (and increasingly Shanghai and Beijing).

The Space Needle is quite aesthetically pleasing. Although when vis-a-vis with Venice it will fall short, granted.
 
 
 
 

 

Why Hangzhou in particular? Big city, but in Chinese terms just a commuter town for Shanghai... probably less smoggy though I'd imagine.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

great city but it's like... sinking into a sea
 
 
I love New York, but I have to say Chicago. It's everything good about New York but you can actually imagine people living there and the architecture and public art is amazing.
 
 
Edinburgh.

Although doesn't Zürich regularly score stupidly high in the "quality of life" department?
 
 
Tromsø:

 
 
 

imo
 
 
Oslo nothing comes close to it.

Bergen
 

 

Going on the Flam railway next year so I will compare Bergen to Oslo, dont think it will beat it though. I rate Oslo higher than New York, London and Rome its such a fantastic city.

Are you serious? What's so fantastic about it?
 
 
The nicest I have been to are either Barcelona or Budapast. However, Barcelona trumps on the fact is has a beach, and every time you come out of a tube station there's a skate spot!

Zurich is really nice too when the weather is good; it has such fantastic countryside in the surrounding areas.
 
 
 
Are you serious? What's so fantastic about it?

 

I was there in June and just found it to be sort of perfect version of the UK, clean streets (I dont remember ever seeing litter), everyone I met was very polite, warm, helpful and welcoming, public transport was amazingly well run. Lots of culture Ibsen museum and Norsk folk museum where highlights for me, beautiful parks, lovely harbour the view from frognerseteren. Every single woman was really attractive when is obviously a bonus.
The fact you can stand right outside parliament and the palace was jaw dropping when you comparing Oslo to New York and London most public buildings are like fortresses.
I'm slightly biased my girlfriend is half icelandic half norwegian so I was staying with her mothers family in Frogner so having all those people around probably swayed it for me.
Karl Johans gate is the best street in the world, I could sit drinking coffee outside the grand cafe for the rest of my life.

The whole city is just perfect in my eyes

It doesn't have the same wonderful reputation in Norway, but it's nice that you think that. I thought Oslo was OK, and I really like Karl Johan but I prefer Bergen (which is a beautiful city). I'm from the west coast though, and probably a little biased. Bergen is the unofficial capital of Western Norway after all. Yes, I've heard about the whole royal palace thing. I didn't know it was a little "weird" before people from other countries started commenting on it. Let's hope that Norwegian society will continue to be open and free.

This part makes me sad I was there just before the terrorism, I'm going back next year for the May 17th celebration so I hope it hasnt changed too much. There dosnt need to be all kinds of wonderous sights to make a city "the best" Oslo has some amazing ones but combining then with the open and free society makes is what makes it the best city for me.
 
 
 

Singapore

It is sad. It was such a huge shock and 22 July feels like a distant nightmare.. Oh you're going back for 17th May? Lovely! I'm a big fan of 17th May and I love wearing my bunad. I'm going to miss walking in the children's parade, I think!
