They cut that but they kept in the brother and sister making out...

nice...
 
 
I've missed the part where they go to France on the bus, haven't I? Shame, best part by miles, and a legendary scene in all respects. Thank the Gzeus for yoo2B.
 
 
I've always found it funny how British people lap up films which effectively take the piss out of Europe, through the way Americans stereotype Europeans. Any film released in the US that takes the piss out of Americans in a stereotypical way would never be popular, they'd be disgusted that a foreigner dared make a film portraying them in a negative/stereotypical light.
 
 
What's absinthe like? Looks rather dodgy..
 
 
I'm wondering if there gunna keep in the almost final scene, especially considering they cut out the Lesbian bit :O

Funnier, but the story is quite as good really, in my opinion anyway.

We're British, not European! We're prepared to take a bit of stick so long as they abuse the French/Germans/Dutch enough  
 
 
The swiss guards weren't wearing those colours when i saw them. This film is rife with inaccuracy *Woo 100 posts*
 
 
I missed all the penis  

Still it's totaly rofl - and the nerdy guy is so cute!
 
 
I bet the Catholics love this film...

I just find the whole film somewhat offensive, not nessesarily because of the mild insults to Europeans, but because it's so hypocritical. Americans certainly can dish it out, but they can't take it. They make plenty of films mocking Europe/other parts of the world in some way, yet are hyper-sensitive and touchy to the slightest critism aimed at them. A lot of countries the banter is often two-way (ie Australia), but with America it's only one way.
 
 
this is hilarious

Quite a few friends of mine have absinthe, I've never tried it though..a friend of mine passed out the other night from drinking too much of it and split open his head and lip because he was hallucinating the ground was opening up and decided to head butt the pavement - haha, sounds dodgy.

:s Think I'll stick with regular spirits!

What? There are loads of films taking the mess out of American people - Anchorman, Get Shorty/Be Cool, most comedy films in general in fact take the piss out of a certain aspect of American society.
 
 
oh gawd yeah, this film is turning me on, mika is mighty fineee
 
 
Vinny jones' parts are the funniest. Good old english lol.

Borat **** down their thoats.
 
 
Question. Do women find the main guy hot? I'm straight, just want to gauge opinion from the women.
 
 
I love how they called Europe a 'country'..

At what point in the film does Anchorman directly target American culture itself? Even the title "Eurotrip" is an indication this is a piss take out of Europe. The only Americans I recall being made fun of in Anchorman was at a personal level, I feel the hispanics/spanish speakers were targeted in quite a few scenes in Anchorman.

General American male chauvinism, red-necks (taken the piss out of rather regularly in many film), stereotypical stupidity...etc

I love Anchorman  

Hispanics were targeted in one scene, as opposed to Americans which was throughout.
 
 
I was pleasantly surprised by that

Haha, oh dear, I've had one friend whose ended up in hospital a few times now due to alcohol but he never seems to learn the lesson. I'm a girl and a bit of a lightweight, which works for me..it's cheaper!  
 
 
When were Hispanics inuslted in Anchorman? The only real mention of them in the film I can remember is Ben Stiller's press gang.

I see where you're coming from, but I don't think Anchorman is quite the same as Eurotrip, in the sense that there's a clear emphasis on Europe, and certain regions in general being portrayed as poor and backward, or some countries females being portrayed as easy. There's massive generalisations in Eurotrip, yet Anchorman is targeting particular eliments of society, rather than generalising them all, and the fact it's an American film in the first place makes all the differene as to whether they'd find it offensive or not.

  well this film has definately got me curious about ''crazy european sex!''
 
 
I guess it ending kinda screws this thread up.
 
 
yeah. i'm on teletext weather now
 
 
i wish i'd seen the start of the film

Well would you accept The Simpsons, Family Guy and South Park then? - there's no doubt that they all rip it out of Americans (plus they all have their own respective films).
 
 
probably the 10th time i watched it. Still makes me laugh

SCOTTY DOESNT KNOW

MI SCUSI
