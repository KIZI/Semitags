A senior U.S. official on Thursday urged Macedonia to make more efforts to solve
its name dispute with neighboring Greece, news from Skopje said.

"The name issue is a key for unblocking Macedonia's integration into the EU and
NATO," Philip Gordon, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for European and
Eurasian Affairs, said on his visit to the western Balkan country.

He said the U.S. strongly supports the efforts for finding a solution to the
name row that baffled Macedonia and its southern neighbor Greece for the past 19
years.

Greece has been opposed to its northern neighbor using the name of Macedonia,
arguing that the name implies territorial claims against its own northern
province, also called Macedonia.

Macedonia's bid to join NATO and its efforts to get its European Union access
talks launched have been thwarted by Greece over the name dispute.

During his stay in Macedonia, Gordon held talks with Macedonian President Gjorge
Ivanov, opposition Socialist Party leader Branko Crvenkovski, as well as Ali
Ahmeti, the head of an ethnic Albanian party.

He was also expected to meet with Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski, who was
returning from an official visit to Morroco, but his plane couldn't land in
Skopje due to volcanic ash cloud.

Gruevski will fly to Zagreb directly, and the two will meet there.
