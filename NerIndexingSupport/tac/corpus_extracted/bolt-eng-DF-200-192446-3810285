The former frontman of the Smiths, who is a staunch vegan and animal rights campaigner, drew the comparisons at a concert in Warsaw, Poland, on Sunday where he is currently in the middle of his summer tour. Before singing Meat is Murder, the 52-year-old British musician told the crowd:

“We all live in a murderous world, as the events in Norway have shown, with 97 dead [sic].
"Though that is nothing compared to what happens in McDonald’s and Kentucky Fried s--- every day.”

Following the outburst, fans expressed their anger at his comments online. One fan wrote: "The killing of children compared to KFC & McDonald’s?!!! What an -------!", while another said: “I really don’t know if that is forgivable? Or of any use to the vegetarian cause?" Others called for his retirement and said "there are no good vibes around him".

This is not the first time Morrissey has courted controversy. In September last year he was accused of racism after describing the Chinese as a "subspecies". He said he made the comment in relation to what he described as the nation's poor treatment of animals. Earlier this year the singer also said killing a stag is the same as killing a child and in 2006 he refused to tour Canada in protest at seal hunting. Despite the distress caused, a spokesperson confirmed the singer stands by his comments during the concert.

"Morrissey has decided not to comment any further as he believes his statement speaks for itself," the spokeperson said.

Thoughts??
 
 
He's proved that he's a knob in the past with his self-righteous ****e in interviews, but this just takes the biscuit. The man's a complete ****er.
 
 
Morrissey is a **** (and I've been saying it for years, not just since today!). What a nob  
 
 
 Micheal Moore already did it. 
 
 
I listen to his songs and songs from The Smiths.

I ignore anything else that comes out of his mouth.
 
 
Personally - as a vegetarian - I'm not too adverse to it. Yes it's shocking, and incredibly offensive, and the timing is bad, and he's done it before. But it's pretty obvious it's only done to be deliberately shocking, and I think there's something for a lot of people to think about behind what he said. I mean sometimes it's the only way you can get anyone to listen
 
 
He's vegetarian, not vegan.
And the comparison between human lives being taken and non-human animal lives being taken in this context isn't all that bad to make.
Consider the millions of animals that are killed in much more horrific manners and it becomes clear that, although comparing them has limited ground, it's hard to damn the killings and at the same time justify the meat industry in it's current form.
 
 
He's talented. Can't help feeling he's just seeking a little publicity, although I do believe the sincerity of his vegetarian beliefs. Some people genuinely do not see that an animals life is worth so much less than ours.
 
 
What a maniac.

Yeah, but it's not the most tasteful time to make a political point about a tangential issue, looks like you are using the event to divert the topic to your cause.
 
 
Don't any of you think that he might also be referring to the processed crap that comes out of KFC and McDonalds each day? If he does then he means that he's also referring to the crap fast food that's killing people slowly. Although that is really bad timing either way.

Yeah, all of this implies that he's a knob, an attention-seeking one at that.
 
 
he's one of those people who need a strait jacket and duct tape on his mouth, chained to a rather large rock and dropped from a height of 5 miles above the deepest sea trench in existence all the while being told he is a ****ing idiot and the world doesn't care about what he says.
 
 
 
Yeah, all of this implies that he's a knob, an attention-seeking one at that.

 

it's not really about attention seeking, it's about a political objective. I mean who else is going to put their reputation on the line and actually bring up what happens in slaughterhouses? If you don't shock anyone no one pays any attention

When would be a tasteful time?
People have brought up the holocaust (which seems to have massive parallels with the egg industry) and get told they're not being tasteful.
So if he left it a year and then said that, do you think people consider it more tasteful?
I highly doubt it.
The stronger argument against him making statements like that is to bring into question their effectiveness, but even that's difficult.
 
 
I kind of get his point, people dying a horrible painful death in Norway, animals dying a horrible and painful death in KFC and MC's death farms, chickens deserve some sympathy too, you know?
The timing is bad though, really bad.

You say that but when would the timing be less awful? People bring up the holocaust and then get told that's disrespectful. If he waited a year to do it do you think people would consider it any less disrespectful   ?

I'm paying attention and, as I've said twice already, all I'm inferring is that he's a knob. There is no comparison between chickens and humans. There is no comparison between chickens' death in McDonalds and humans' death on Utoya Island.
 
 
And if I find a ten tonne KFC Family Bucket

Why not? Chickens feel pain. They certainly suffer as much as we do. And since we're discussing suffering where's the difference?

What are these 'massive parallels'?
 
 
Not only has he reinforced the general meat eaters stance that vegetarians are annoying little twerps he has also added a dose of stereotypical PETA 'animals are more important that humans' which is just going to create more hate for vegetarians everywhere.

People saying he has a point need to reevaluate their morals entirely. He is using a massacre as a platform to 'shock' people to hop on his bandwagon. Only a complete **** would even think of even hinting at supporting this.

The only thing this does is make me and everyone else who is normal want to pelt Morrisey and every other vegetarian we see with big macs and twisters and im sure someone who is even more pissed off than me will be happy to knock out a cow with a baseball bat then liquidize it and cover that smug prick in the concoction and write 'i love meat yum yum yum' on the side of his house in moose blood just because he pissed them off not because he hates animals or whatever.

He is not furthering his cause he is causing more aggro and breeding more ignorance.

Thank **** i never liked the smiths either lol
 
 
I know its not a tasteful thing for him to have said, but he's never been afraid to put in his 2 pence regardless of the subject and its sensitivity. His animal rights activism is well known too, so this comment comes as no surprise. Its just important not to blow his comments out of the context he himself puts on them (yes he is self-righteous and not for the easily offended I guess.)

You could call him eccentric, but his cause is sincere underneath the surface- i.e animal welfare in this case. Take it all with a pinch of salt. Its like his song about the moors murders with Myra Hindley- that was hugely sensitive at the time and people started accusing him of all the negatives like capitalising on the misery of others etc when his motive was the opposite. Or maybe I'm just biased because he's one of my heroes.
 
 
 
What are these 'massive parallels'?

 

Actual answer:
Spoiler:

Being crammed into small spaces for hours on end, being well and truly starved.
Also the transportation of animals is similar to that of the transportation of Jews on the trains.
I'm not sure to what extend bodily mutilation occurred in the camps, but it occurs very early on for birds with their beaks being cut off. They also have virtually no stimulation.

Other answer:
They're so obvious I can only wonder why you ask unless you're trolling.
 
 
 
Not only has he reinforced the general meat eaters stance that vegetarians are annoying little twerps

 

Only because they seem to offend your sensibilities. All the anti-vegetarian prejudice always so obviously comes from feeling very unsettled by what is actually being said. And the reaction is always being even more barbaric and vile in response (as with what you said about liquidizing a cow or whatever.) Not for a minute do you even think about what you're actually doing, which is a great shame really.
 
 
I don't understand why people think humans feel more pain than animals...

I don't condemn what he says, just the timing.
 
 
 
What are these 'massive parallels'?

 

Surely you need only look at the sort of numbers involved? I mean when you actually look at them there isn't really a similarity. The meat industry is by far and away much worse when it comes to numbers. 60 Billion animals killed every single year as part of the meat industry as compared to what? 11 million jews during the holocaust?

And the really sad thing is it is clearly isn't about numbers, it's about living sentient creatures who feel pain just as humans do

I'm not even outright condemning meat-eating on the whole, but honestly you don't have to look very far to realise that every time you buy anything from McDonalds you're basically contributing to something very easily comparable to the holocaust
 
 
He is talented and rich enough to be able to say what he likes imo.
 
 
 
I don't understand why people think humans feel more pain than animals...

I don't condemn what he says, just the timing.

 

I fail to see when the timing would be acceptable and not simply frowned upon.
 
 
Its disrespectful to the souls and family of the dead, period.

As therestoomuchtolove says, timing is irrelevant, and wouldnt make the statement any less atrocious.
 
 
The idiocy in this thread from the people trying to defend Morrisey is outstanding. To say that a chicken has an equal moral and ethical status to a human being is greatly disturbing. This is nothing more than nihilism and anti-humanism.

I guess you're right.
I am with Morrissey on this one though, I don't understand why people think human suffering is somehow more tragic than suffering of other species.

I do disagree with speciesism but at the same time, I tend to empathise with humans more. Emotionally I feel more of a connection most of the time. But I don't see why from a moral perspective that can be said to have any weight.
 
 
Who the **** listens to this guy anyway? He clearly hasn't tasted how good KFC's chicken actually is.
 
 
 
Where has anyone claimed that?

 

If you agree that chickens and humans do not have an equal moral and ethical status then you should have no problems recognising that the comparisons of the Norwegian massacre and the holocaust to chicken farming is completely absurd.
 
 
 
Only because they seem to offend your sensibilities.

 

No, they offend your average meat eating blokey bloke who doesn't need to see a picture of a dead baby cow or a chicken with a broken leg while he is going about his day or eating his lunch because he is a semi conscious nitwit.

I dont eat processed food but i do eat meat, i couldn't care less about some animals dying.

 
All the anti-vegetarian prejudice always so obviously comes from feeling very unsettled by what is actually being said.

 

Yes, things like 'That Norwegian massacre? nothing compared to what KFC and Mc D's do' is quite unsettling and feeds prejudice as i said.

 
And the reaction is always being even more barbaric and vile in response (as with what you said about liquidizing a cow or whatever.)

 

The idea is facetious. The fact is Morrissay saying that will create outrage against himself not the companies he is fighting making him a moron.

 
Not for a minute do you even think about what you're actually doing, which is a great shame really.

 

Huh?
 
 
 
If you agree that chickens and humans do not have an equal moral and ethical status then you should have no problems recognising that the comparisons of the Norwegian massacre and the holocaust to chicken farming is completely absurd.

 

I don't see how that logic works.
I disagree with basing it on a species divide to begin with.
Secondly even if you take human A who happens to have more of a moral standing than chicken B, I don't see why they're not comparable. They're obviously not synonymous, but that doesn't mean a comparison is out of the question. If both are being treated poorly in relevantly similar manners it's absurd to think it's not comparable.
 
 
 
And what about the disrespect shown to animals?

 

I'm no expert, but i know that if a chicken was murdered, it wouldnt have the same repercussions among its relatives and friends as when a human is murdered. Therefore a comment made about a dead chicken isnt even half as disrespectful as a comment made about a dead human.

But what of the disrespect shown to the bird before it's life is taken?
Furthermore, if someone had the same level of emotional commitment to a particular bird, would that make the repercussions just as serious to you?
One of my friends rescued some chickens who were in an appalling state, and tried to nurse the, back to health. Slowly they died from tumors and what have you (the main killer was ovary cancer). She became incredibly attached to them. If someone had just shot one of them killing it would that be as serious to you?
 
 
He really is one of those dicks I'd love to punch in the face.

You've missed the point. By unsettling I meant (fairly obviously) that it's pretty obvious that most meat-eaters are unsettled by the idea that that them eating meat renders them cruel or unfeeling, or simply ignorant.
 
 
Sounds like a fair enough statement, I don't personally agree with it but it's fair enough.

People on here are taking it so personally as if he's devaluing a human's life. No, he's not - he's just saying an animal's life is just as important.

Sorry, I did not phrase that correctly, a comparison per se is not absurd based on that premise, but rather comparing the two then trying to make some form of equivocation or rather like Morrissey did, saying that the treatment of animals is a greater tragedy is clearly 'absurd' according the majority popular opinion.

Whilst ultimately, all ethics is completely arbritary, humans will naturally idenitfy with other humans more, furthermore, humans are capable of reasoning, creativity, imagination etc. beyond all other species which is a reason to grant it a higher moral status in a quasilogical manner, which is the best you can get with ethics.
 
 
Good work from the people saying 'he's a knob, he's a maniac' etc. Why not form a proper argument instead of just spouting *******s?

No it wouldnt, because the death of a pet (what essentially the chicken was to your friend) isnt, in most cases as hurtful as the death of a relative. However i do accept that people can become very attached to their animals. But who's attached to the chickens that Mcdonalds and KFC slaughter?
 
 
Sure he was insensitive, but he's at least valid in drawing a parallel between the murder of animals and the murder of humans; humans are animals. If it's just the intelligence and usefulness of the animal in question that justifies its death then there's no clear reason to exempt humans. The moral underpinnings of farming are shady at best.
 
 
Whilst it's not a comment I would have made myself, I can see Morrisey's point of view.
Billions of animals are suffering insurmountable amounts of pain because of the meat industry and Morrisey tends to be zealous over the issue.
It will be unfortunate if people begin to form negative ideas towards vegetarians based on his actions.

When you consider the number of animals being killed though, the damage we're doing to many environments through general industrial farming methods, there is certainly an argument that it is a greater tragedy.
The comparison of what is more or less moral here though seems pointless whatever someone's view is. If you damn the killer for killing the humans you're going to need a sophisticated and frankly bizarre argument to even attempt to justify the meat industry. And most people simply can't do that.
 
 
 
Why not? Chickens feel pain. They certainly suffer as much as we do. And since we're discussing suffering where's the difference?

 

Because one is a ****ing chicken. End of.

How does equivocating human life and a chicken's life not degrading to humanity? Essentially what you are saying is that I am no better than a bird that has no capacity for reasoning, intelligence, creativity, imagination etc.

Essentially, what can be deduced from your words is that you think my humanity and personhood is meaningless.
 
 
 
No it wouldnt, because the death of a pet (what essentially the chicken was to your friend) isnt, in most cases as hurtful as the death of a relative. However i do accept that people can become very attached to their animals. But who's attached to the chickens that Mcdonalds and KFC slaughter?

 

But you're still missing the main argument I'm using, whilst the animals are alive, what do you make of the disrespect shown to them, the suffering they're caused, the insanity they're forced to endure?
You seem to just ignore it but it seems pretty relevant.

It seems more like he's trying to say animals are more important than we give them credit for. I'm not sure that that is Morrissey's stand point, as I don't know if he does believe all animals are equal. However that wouldn't necessarily mean human life is any more or less valuable from a moral sense.

You're capacity for reasoning etc is utterly irrelevant. It's like saying smarter people's lives are more worthwhile than stupid people's. Who draws the line where?

The actual point is that, in terms of our capacity to suffer, we aren't different to a chicken at all.
 
 
Oh Morrissey   This has to be up there as one of his worst.
 
 
 
Because one is a ****ing chicken. End of.

 

See you've just completely ignored the question. It isn't 'end of'. Why don't you actually try and view this from a position other than your own utterly solipsistic view of the world?

If we're discussing pain and death being inflicted, there is absolutely no difference between how a chicken and a human perceive it.
 
 
People have a choice (well adults at least) about going to KFC and McDonalds. Brievik's victims did not have a choice.
 
 
It was possibly a bad time to say it, and perhaps he'd be better off making a speech out of it so he could articulate his views more clearly, but I think he has a point. I don't understand how it's fine to slaughter hundreds of thousands of pigs each year, who have the intelligence of a 4 year old, but the act of slaughtering a 4 year old child is disgusting.

(Yes I know that 4 year old child would have grown into an adult, but I'm talking about the act in itself "oh that poor child would have been so scared, it wouldn't have been able to defend itself, how could you murder a child ".)
 
 
 
People have a choice (well adults at least) about going to KFC and McDonalds. Brievik's victims did not have a choice.

 

False analogy - that cow that was your burger did not have a choice to become a burger or not either.

This is pretty irrelevant? The animals don't have a choice in being carted off to slaughterhouses

Of course it would. If you put humans and chickens on an equal footing ethically then why should I give more money to human charities over chicken charities, badger charities, camel charities and so forth? There is no reason, therefore the logical conclusion would to give equal charity money to each species, and considering how many species exist, it would mean that that Homo sapiens are left with very little relative to what humans receive in charity money currently.
 
 
Regardless of how noble his concern is for animal welfare, it was misjudged of him to use this event as a device on which to make a comparison for his views and could only cause distaste to people. He is trying to bring humankind down a peg or 2 by saying that we are equal to animals in every way. So why aren't we listening to a cow making a philosophical point rather than a pop/rock singer? Maybe we should try.

That's a much broader topic than your letting on, there are ecological factors to consider, the different positions the different beings will all be in, the different levels of support all ready in place for the charities.
 
 
I've turned vegetarian but I do consider humans more important than animals simply because I am one. All other animals appear to be, by default, speciesist and I think humans are the same when it comes to the crunch (i.e. an animal's life for your own). Which is why massacring your own kind, i.e. Brievik's actions, is more horrendous than massacring animals.

I turned vegetarian because I don't believe it is good for our own wellbeing to treat animals so horrendously and inflict unnecessary suffering, nor do I think it is the best use of land.
 
 
 
But you're still missing the main argument I'm using, whilst the animals are alive, what do you make of the disrespect shown to them, the suffering they're caused, the insanity they're forced to endure?
You seem to just ignore it but it seems pretty relevant.

 

Its not relevant to the Norweigan incident though, as far as i know the victims werent tortured or anything, just injured and killed, so its not relevant, whats relevant are the deaths, and the people affected by the deaths, of which there is no comparison.
 
 
Bigmouth Strikes Again. I am a huge Morrissey fan, and I think his outspoken views on certain topics like the Royal Family have had an element of truth but are on the whole overstated. To those who say he is attention seeking, this is one of the greatest frontmen the music scene has ever seen. He is a passionate veggy, but I think this is too close to the bone after such a short time. Although raising awareness for animal rights, he needs to take a close look at what he's sad and hopefully apologise.

OK, now let's admit your ad hoc argument, Homo sapien is currently one of the most ecological 'successful' vertebrate species on the planet, we have capitalised and rendered to us almost every single type of land environment available to us. Due to globalisation we essentially exist within one population exceeding 6 billion members, meanwhile, others species are critically endangered and only occupy very restricted ecological niches that must be protected in order for those species to survive.

What now for the Homo sapien, why based on the premises established previously by yourself it would be positively immoral for any of us to give any money to human charities for the rest of our lives? Can't you see how ridiculous this is?

From what I'm saying? Since when was I Morrissey?

All I'm saying is chicken nor human deserve to be slaughtered in an inhumane way. I think that's a fair enough viewpoint even if you do not agree with it.

There is obviously a relevance of the deaths, both seem needless and cruel.

Straw-man argument, I didn't say it is immoral for us to give any money to human charities.
And most if not all ecosystems have value to us, in almost all cases the more damage we do to them, the less value they have for us.
 
 
I represent all vegetarians, and I condemn his statements.

The actual point is that, in terms of our capacity to suffer, we aren't different to a chicken at all.

 

The differences in intelligence between humans is almost neglible compared to the extent of the differences in intelligence between humans and other species, so I really don't think your counterargument holds any ground. Even people with low IQ are vastly more intelligent than apes of other species. Even if we were to point out the exception of the severely mentally retarded then we would still need to consider the societal impact i.e. the grief caused by family that would ensue after that person's death relative to what would occur after the death of say a Chimpanzee.

Erm, I wouldn't agree with your second point, I think generally the suffering of humans is much more complex then that of chickens -- for example we can can imagine the future, we have the cognitive capacity to dwell for long periods on the past. But then again, this is not an issue I know a lot about.
 
 
 
The former frontman of the Smiths, who is a staunch vegan and animal rights campaigner, drew the comparisons at a concert in Warsaw, Poland, on Sunday where he is currently in the middle of his summer tour. Before singing Meat is Murder, the 52-year-old British musician told the crowd:

“We all live in a murderous world, as the events in Norway have shown, with 97 dead [sic].
"Though that is nothing compared to what happens in McDonald’s and Kentucky Fried s--- every day.”

Following the outburst, fans expressed their anger at his comments online. One fan wrote: "The killing of children compared to KFC & McDonald’s?!!! What an -------!", while another said: “I really don’t know if that is forgivable? Or of any use to the vegetarian cause?" Others called for his retirement and said "there are no good vibes around him".

This is not the first time Morrissey has courted controversy. In September last year he was accused of racism after describing the Chinese as a "subspecies". He said he made the comment in relation to what he described as the nation's poor treatment of animals. Earlier this year the singer also said killing a stag is the same as killing a child and in 2006 he refused to tour Canada in protest at seal hunting. Despite the distress caused, a spokesperson confirmed the singer stands by his comments during the concert.

"Morrissey has decided not to comment any further as he believes his statement speaks for itself," the spokeperson said.

Thoughts??

 

It's obviously quite pretentious, self-righteous, ignorant or a mixture of a three. If his music wasn't as good as it is, I don't think this would be taken so lightly. I guess that in itself is a hypocrisy in those who condemn him and promote his music.
 
 
I'm a meat eater (not a homo   ) but I kinda agree with Morrissey...I'm not a fan of his music, I just think his point is valid. What makes human life more sacred?

I don't see any reason not to eat animals, that's the food chain after all...but there's no reason why animals have to live a terrible life before suffering a terrible death
 
 
 
Straw-man argument, I didn't say it is immoral for us to give any money to human charities.
And most if not all ecosystems have value to us, in almost all cases the more damage we do to them, the less value they have for us.

 

Oh, how awfully anthropocentric of you, you are now very much concerned about how much value the ecosystems have for us, and concerned that damaging these ecosystems will indirectly damage us
 
 
 
You've missed the point. By unsettling I meant (fairly obviously) that it's pretty obvious that most meat-eaters are unsettled by the idea that that them eating meat renders them cruel or unfeeling, or simply ignorant.

 

You missed all of my points and went for the easiest.

There is **** all, to me and a few others, 'unsettling' about eating meat, if there were people wouldn't eat it. Simple. Im talking about this statement in relation to fast food, that is unsettling. Simple.

You seem to think that people who eat meat have some sort of guilt complex and you dont specify people in relation to this fast food issue and tar every meat eater with the same brush.. exactly the same abysmal tactics militant veggies and PETA types utilize and fail with because they are ignorant, annoying, preachy and above all ****ing stupid beyond the point of civility and reason.

Anything else you want to add?
 
 
 
The differences in intelligence between humans is almost neglible compared to the extent of the differences in intelligence between humans and other species, so I really don't think your counterargument holds any ground. Even people with low IQ are vastly more intelligent than apes of other species. Even if we were to point out the exception of the severely mentally retarded then we would still need to consider the societal impact i.e. the grief caused by family that would ensue after that person's death relative to what would occur after the death of say a Chimpanzee.

 

And if the elite of the IQ, the top of mensa, banded together and decided to kill people regardless of the law, and said that it was in their interests, and these people have less of a moral standing so that's okay, what would your take on that be?

 
Erm, I wouldn't agree with your second point, I think generally the suffering of humans is much more complex then that of chickens -- for example we can can imagine the future, we have the cognitive capacity to dwell for long periods on the past. But then again, this is not an issue I know a lot about.
 

Does the complexity (which isn't in all humans) make a different to the level of suffering being felt?
That's an impossible question, so don't either of you even attempt to answer it. But without an answer it seems senseless to bring it up at all.

Of course, again you're completely ignoring the fact that the chimpanzee has family members who will grieve for it. Even in the animal kingdom this happens, parents form attachments for their young etc etc.

Perhaps pain is a better word than suffering then. Either way I don't understand the double standard between saying it's okay to kill an animal and not to kill a human being.

As I said this isn't really what the discussion is about. Because KFC, McDonalds etc. were mentioned, what morrissey was obviously commenting on was the comparisons between the extent of animal suffering and what happened in norway. Because in this sense, if you want to go into statistics, what companies like KFC etc do is obviously far more extreme (with incredibly dangerous long term effects) than what any one serial killer can possibly do.
 
 
 
Oh, how awfully anthropocentric of you, you are now very much concerned about how much value the ecosystems have for us, and concerned that damaging these ecosystems will indirectly damage us

 

I think animals have a value in and of themselves, but also they are valuable to us. That's one of the reasons why this charity scenario is impossible to swallow, it's very different in reality to what you portrayed.
 
 
 
I fail to see when the timing would be acceptable and not simply frowned upon.

 

I fail to see how someone cannot draw a parallel between the massacre of humans and animals alike.

This is why he felt the need to draw attention to the point. Those who have the capacity to empathise with animals feel the way people feel about the Norwegian massacre every day of the week.

well people choose to eat it because it's very easy to ignore some of the difficult truths that one has to ignore in order to eat meat and not feel guilty

Regarding your first point: Like I said, I think the difference in intelligence between the smartest in society and the stupidest in society is so small that this sort of action could not be morally justified. Furthermore, such a thing would not at all be socially acceptable, leading to the disintegration of society and much suffering amongst humans.

Regarding your second point: Neuroscience can tell us a lot about pain and suffering, and of course although we can't say for sure how chickens percieve the universe we can make very good educated guesses, in the same way in that we can say that some animals only see in black and white, of course we can't say this for sure, but we can be very confident of this fact because of science. Unfortunately at the present moment I'm almost completely unlearned in this field and can't really say much more.
 
 
 
There is no comparison between chickens and humans. There is no comparison between chickens' death in McDonalds and humans' death on Utoya Island.

 

Except both humans and chickens are living organisms that we call animals? Is that not a pretty good similarity?
 
 
 
I'm not sure why you're quoting me in that post.

 

Oh sorry, I must have misread. Were you agreeing with me?

The degradation of society may not be something they care about.
And who is to say how much of a gap is needed. You say it's "so small" but they may perceive it as too big.

With regards to your point on pain, neuroscience simply can't give us insights in comparing pain intensity. There's no current way of saying how the mind works, but it seems pretty difficult to simply reduce it down to the hardware level. If it was possible to currently do that, the philosophy of mind would be a very different topic.

But surely intelligence is fairly irrelevant when it comes to suffering? Otherwise we're basically just justifying killing on the basis that who we're killing is weak. Yet with our own species we see preying on the weak as a fairly cruel thing to do
 
 
 
Oh sorry, I must have misread. Were you agreeing with me?

 

I'm disagreeing with people who say "such bad timing" because the timing seems irrelevant, he could make the post in 5 years time and still be frowned upon. But most of my other posts are challenging speciesism, the treatment of animals in the meat industry, and the way many people disregard all the moral worth of animals.
 
 
 
I think animals have a value in and of themselves, but also they are valuable to us. That's one of the reasons why this charity scenario is impossible to swallow, it's very different in reality to what you portrayed.

 

The charity scenario logically follows from the premise that humans and other species are ethically equivalent, or even that humans are of less worth that other species.

This is exactly what was implied by Morrisey, and if you don't agree with Morrissey then I don't see exactly what we are arguing about.  
 
 
I have to admit I do like Morrissey's music and a lot of The Smith's material from the 80s.

However, this statement by Morrissey is way out of line. As much as I love animals the death of 97 human beings is much worse than ten million animal deaths.

What I have found with those animal rights campaigners such as morrissey that they often go around saying it is wrong to kill animals and then support abortion, through the killing of inocent babies.

Animal rights campaigners not saying all of them but the most of them get so sucked into animal welfare that they neglect more serious issues such as child and adult welfare. Another area of concern is the green movement ( the people that go around handcuffing themselves to trees so they don't get taken down).. I was shocked where I read that the majority of those in the Green movement are pro abortion.

So it is ok to save a tree but kill an unborn child. WORLD GOING MAD

I've all ready shown you the ways in which it's far more complex than you're making out.
And I don't agree with Morrissey, I also don't agree with the statements you've made about not agreeing with Morrissey.
 
 
 
Why not? Chickens feel pain. They certainly suffer as much as we do. And since we're discussing suffering where's the difference?

 

Those chicken/cattle are bred for the purpose of becoming chicken nuggets/beefburgers.

Human's at a political youth camp were not bred to be slaughtered by a murderous extremist.

There is your difference.

You're confusing a lot of different issues there.

So if I breed with the specific purpose of putting my children through the conditions of farms, and then kill and eat them, but I bred them for that purpose that makes it okay?
And for sake of argument lets also say that they were never exposed to language, and before showing signs of intelligent thought I gave them brain damage.
 
 
 
See you've just completely ignored the question. It isn't 'end of'. Why don't you actually try and view this from a position other than your own utterly solipsistic view of the world?

If we're discussing pain and death being inflicted, there is absolutely no difference between how a chicken and a human perceive it.

 

I'm not going to debate this. A human is worth more than a chicken or a cow or an ape.

Obviously you view animal life and human life equally - I do not. There is nothing more to discuss. 'End of'.
 
 
 
You seem to think that people who eat meat have some sort of guilt complex and you dont specify people in relation to this fast food issue and tar every meat eater with the same brush.

 

Oh and I'm sorry, I didn't read properly about you not eating processed food. It wasn't a personal attack anyway. I really don't care about whether other people are bothered by eating meat or not. It's just the double standard here in saying that the massacre in Norway is really very different to what happens every day in slaughterhouses.

No, as they are the same species as you. Were your children chickens then I'd have no qualms at all with your suggestion. However, as this is an impossibility, it would be wrong and hence you'd be jailed.

The reason I believe this is because we as humans have developed and evolved to become the dominant species on our planet. We are therefore the 'alpha-animals', the 'ruling-class'. We can alter the climate, the foodchain, can cause extinction of species if we so wish, and so on. We are the controlling species, the top predators.

It's absolutely irrelevant. They still feel pain, they aren't aware of that being their purpose and they still have to undergo tremendous suffering.

That's like saying someone giving birth to and raising a human until they are ready to be eaten is morally justifiable

I can't speak of other people's ethical judgements, if they percieve the gap as too big than that is up to them, but all I'm saying is that I would consider them acting upon this as unethical.

I really think this is because the science is still very much in its infancy, which has allowed space for philosophy to dominate the discussion. It has been the same story throughout history, a lack of science leads to all sorts of philosophsing for example, when explaining matters such as planetary orbits, illness, the diversity of species etc.

I am an aspiring neuroscientist BTW.

Ah I see, a grand mixture of unjustified speciesism and "might = right" attitude.

By the way as men have evolved to be the dominant sex, it's clearly fine for them to rape women  .

It doesn't quite work like that, philosophy and science are very interlinked. And philosophical critiques of scientific claims have been very useful for both philosophy and science, which is why in many areas the gap between them is hard to distinguish.

Language and behavior seem very much to be largely in the public realm, they're a means of communicating. At the same time concepts such as love, pain, emotions and sensory perceptions remain in many ways in the private realm and aren't translatable in terms of comparison in a lot of ways.

The whole point is you aren't even questioning how you view them or giving a reason for why they aren't equal. You can't just say 'end of'. As one of the posters above said, some people used to think the same about black people because they were so completely unable to empathise with anything so distant from their own experience, when in reality the pain they endure is exactly the same.
 
 
What a bloody idiot

people just need to stop comparing the massacre to other things, cos they sound stupid and insensitive. Like Glen Bleck, who never fails to surprise people with his dumbassery

I disagree, different gender is not a different species, and although men could technically cause the extinction of women, it would coincide with the extinction of men too. So in practice, it would be impossible. Men can't exist without women, and so they are equal in value, and rape is obviously not acceptable. I think you were probably being sarcastic, but I felt it was worth making that point anyway.

Yes it is insensitive, but it's at least got a positive political objective behind it. I mean which of the victims family members are actually going to care what Morrissey says after what they've already endured? And it's nothing like the Glenn Beck comments because in this case there is actually a fairly obvious comparison to be made
 
 
I hope his family dies a slow, painful death one by one. I hope he gets cancer and is crippled. I hope he leads a long but painful life!
 
 
 
Morrisey's always been a dick. This isn't news.

Morrissey is a **** (and I've been saying it for years, not just since today!). What a nob  

 

 
He's proved that he's a knob in the past with his self-righteous ****e in interviews, but this just takes the biscuit. The man's a complete ****er.

 

How you two had the same amount of pos rep for those posts as you did neg rep is beyond me. ****ing Smiths fan boys going "OMG, you can't insult our saviour!". Stuck up tossers. The guy is a prick for drawing the comparison, you can't really deny that, no matter how much you like The Smiths

It is not irrelevant at all. It is natural for animals to eat other animals. Watch 5 minutes of the Discovery channel and you will see this.

We have also evolved to become the 'ruling predator' of the animal kingdom, and so we ultimately get to eat whatever other animal we wish. Other members of our species (i.e. children) are equal, and so are not food.

If you were face to face with a wild lion, and it was hungry, do you really think it would spare you out of the good of its heart? No. Replace the lion with a hypothetical carnivorous chicken; it would also eat you. That's why we can eat chickens.

If you can't justify your speciesism why should I have to justify my sexism?

 

Sex and gender are two words for the same thing?

Speciesism is natural. Humans did not chose to evolve how we did, nor did we chose for other animals to be incapable of the intelligence that we humans have, as demonstrated by our construction of buildings, cars, etc. We have evolved into the top predator, there is nothing to justify.

Sexism on the other hand is an altogether different issue. While men and women are not equal insofar as they are identical in all aspects, one cannot survive without the other. I believe that there should therefore be a mutual respect and acknowledgement between both male and female humans. By raping either a man or a woman, this mutual respect would be compromised. I would say, therefore, it is wrong to rape another.

Oh wow wow wow.
Let me open this up for you.
Sex = biological differences.
Gender = behavior / personality / identity.

It being natural doesn't have any standing in the moral issues of right or wrong:
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalistic_fallacy 

Why is the mutual respect important? If we can enslave and dominate women for our own ends and can force them to survive, and thus continue to survive ourselves there's no need for this mutual respect.
 
 
 
But the whole point is the double standard. We accept easily that killing other humans is wrong, yet we kill animals without question. Surely what we should be using our greater intelligence for is to transcend our animal instincts?

 

While theoretically I agree, as animals we need to retain some 'animal instincts' just to survive, because we are "animals". Our bodies need protein to develop properly, and this comes primarily from meats. To function optimally we must consume meat therefore; our inability to digest fibre, a problem herbivores do not share, is evidence of this.
 
 
 
Why don't you?

 

I can't articulate it really. Anecdotally, if I was put in a room with two buttons - one that killed a random human and one that killed a random animal, I'd press the animal button 100% of the time. What would you do, out of interest?
 
 
 
He's vegetarian, not vegan.
And the comparison between human lives being taken and non-human animal lives being taken in this context isn't all that bad to make.
Consider the millions of animals that are killed in much more horrific manners and it becomes clear that, although comparing them has limited ground, it's hard to damn the killings and at the same time justify the meat industry in it's current form.

 

What makes you say he's vegetarian? Pretty sure he's vegan - it would be hugely hypocritical for anyone but a vegan to make that statement, and I can't imagine him being that inconstant in his beliefs.
 
 
 
While theoretically I agree, as animals we need to retain some 'animal instincts' just to survive, because we are &quot;animals&quot;. Our bodies need protein to develop properly, and this comes primarily from meats. To function optimally we must consume meat therefore; our inability to digest fibre, a problem herbivores do not share, is evidence of this.

 

You can get everything you need nutrient wise from a vegan diet.
 
 
Personally - as a vegetarian - I think it's bloody horrible and misjudged to the max. What a buttbag. As if those families are going to be reassured by that "ah well at least our child wasn't kept in a battery farm, that's a mercy".
NO.

The whole thing falls apart when you consider that no one "needs" meat to survive, we can get protein from other sources, and that people can live perfectly healthily as vegetarians.

Suggesting we need meat to function "optimally" is a bit silly as it sort of suggests we need meat to be succesful. We aren't exactly a society run in order of who posseses the most physical strength.

Fair enough on the gender/sex differences.

An opinion on wikipedia does not mean it is the outright truth. I'm not going to repeat the point I have already made quite clearly.

Mutual respect is important because women are of equal importance to us. Again, I am not going to repeat my points. To be honest I don't even see how sexism has any relevance to whether or not murdering chickens and children are equal in barbarity.
 
 
He's a musician for christ sake. You can't take everything out of his mouth to be a literal black and white truth. We all know he's vegetarian and more than likely ranks animals higher than humans, so many rock stars exaggerate for effect and controversy. He's always known to say this kind of thing, he hasn't shocked us in a while anyway, so about time.

So you're not going to argue against the link then?

And you've not justified it being important, I laid out a scenario where we can see it isn't important.

And I'm not even saying they're necessarily equal, but if one is wrong it's hard to justify the other.
 
 
 
Personally - as a vegetarian - I think it's bloody horrible and misjudged to the max. What a buttbag. As if those families are going to be reassured by that "ah well at least our child wasn't kept in a battery farm, that's a mercy".
NO.

 

It obviously wasn't aimed at those families in particular
 
 
 
Sex and gender are two words for the same thing?

 

Your sex is what you're born with; your gender is how you perceive yourself to be.

 
Speciesism is natural. Humans did not chose to evolve how we did, nor did we chose for other animals to be incapable of the intelligence that we humans have, as demonstrated by our construction of buildings, cars, etc. We have evolved into the top predator, there is nothing to justify.

 

If an alien race came to Earth and began to breed humans to become as economical is possible to eat, would it make it morally justifiable?
edit: morally justifiable to humans. Would we sit back and say "oh, fair enough. Keep breeding those humans; you're the smart ones."?
Assuming that the aliens believed themselves to be more intelligent than us, if we indicated to the aliens that we didn't want to be eaten, tried to escape, and resist, would the aliens need to justify their actions? To parallel it to the human/other animal scenario: we could also assume that the alien has no need to eat us for any reason other than taste.

I'm not sure if an arguement over what is natural holds here. The entire system of modern farming techniques isn't natural at all - from the genetics and breeding of the animals, to what and how they are raised and slaughtered.
 
 
And I compare Morrisey to a ****ing idiot.
 
 
Oh Morrissey. What is he like.
 
 
 
You can get everything you need nutrient wise from a vegan diet.

 

You can, but it is certainly not natural to do so.

 
The whole thing falls apart when you consider that no one "needs" meat to survive, we can get protein from other sources, and that people can live perfectly healthily as vegetarians.

Suggesting we need meat to function "optimally" is a bit silly as it sort of suggests we need meat to be succesful. We aren't exactly a society run in order of who posseses the most physical strength.

 

To be fair, I do sort of agree with you. Nobody 'needs' meat.

On the other hand, you could then argue you are destroying the 'homes' for countless insects, etc. Being vegetarian is of no benefit to a human being, and so why should one be vegetarian if is not said human beings preference?

This seems to be straying from the original topic, so I will end here.

wow I'd love to see you and Im so academic argue over some new pointless, dull topic

I imagine neither of you would back down, so you'd probably constantly argue for the next 2 years
 
 
I think he makes a fair point, to be quite honest. It's certainly interesting how we can sit back and say slaughtering millions of animals every year is perfectly justifiable, yet the murder of even one human is completely despicable. Even more interesting is the fact that some deaths are celebrated (Osama Bin Laden comes to mind) whilst others are utterly condemned. We're a nation of hypocrites. Murder is apparently fine as long as it directly benefits you or your country, but as soon as it affects you in a negative way, it's an entirely different matter.
 
 
 
I can't articulate it really. Anecdotally, if I was put in a room with two buttons - one that killed a random human and one that killed a random animal, I'd press the animal button 100% of the time. What would you do, out of interest?

 

Why can't you articulate it? If you can't articulate an opinion, how can you justify having it?

Come on, I asked you a fairly simple question. Why don't you think animal life and human life isn't equal?
 
 
 
On the other hand, you could then argue you are destroying the 'homes' for countless insects, etc. Being vegetarian is of no benefit to a human being, and so why should one be vegetarian if is not said human beings preference?

 

Of course you're right but I think it's more of a question of doing as much as you can. Obviously standing on the occasional flower is difficult to avoid, but some things can be avoided.

And no it isn't of any real benefit (besides a reduced risk of cancer) but without sounding really un-hip something's really got to be done about the meat industry, because it's really by far the worst thing in terms of global warming etc.
 
 
 
No one has mentioned The Smiths  

 

You mentioned him being the frontman of The Smiths in the OP  

If he wasn't the ex-frontman of The Smiths then he'd be a nobody.

Not only has he reinforced the general meat eaters stance that vegetarians are annoying little twerps he has also added a dose of stereotypical PETA 'animals are more important that humans' which is just going to create more hate for vegetarians everywhere.

People saying he has a point need to reevaluate their morals entirely. He is using a massacre as a platform to 'shock' people to hop on his bandwagon. Only a complete **** would even think of even hinting at supporting this.

The only thing this does is make me and everyone else who is normal want to pelt Morrisey and every other vegetarian we see with big macs and twisters and im sure someone who is even more pissed off than me will be happy to knock out a cow with a baseball bat then liquidize it and cover that smug prick in the concoction and write 'i love meat yum yum yum' on the side of his house in moose blood just because he pissed them off not because he hates animals or whatever.

He is not furthering his cause he is causing more aggro and breeding more ignorance.

Thank **** i never liked the smiths either lol

 

When did he say that animals are more important than humans? He thinks that the meat industry is worse than the Norway attacks because of the scale, not because the killing of animals is worse than humans. There is no reason to consider human's suffering as more important to avoid than animal's, other than the arrogant belief we seem to have of humans as the only species worth preserving for its own sake. It's not me who needs to reevaluate my morals.
 
 
Well, this is in no way going to stop me eating KFC or McDonalds.

I mean, if someones got to commit murder so I can have KFC then good, because the graveh is so worth it  
 
 
 
You've missed the point. By unsettling I meant (fairly obviously) that it's pretty obvious that most meat-eaters are unsettled by the idea that that them eating meat renders them cruel or unfeeling, or simply ignorant.

 

 
 
 
 
well people choose to eat it because it's very easy to ignore some of the difficult truths that one has to ignore in order to eat meat and not feel guilty

 

lol
 
 
 
you just... think that? There used to be a time where white people believed they were superior and had more rights than a black man

 

the black man then says to the white man, "no, we are actually equal"

a chicken is never gonna do that
 
 
I love all the neg rep thats been thrown around to completely legitimate points by butthurt Morrissey fans
 
 
 
What makes you say he's vegetarian? Pretty sure he's vegan - it would be hugely hypocritical for anyone but a vegan to make that statement, and I can't imagine him being that inconstant in his beliefs.

 

I've read all over the place that he's vegetarian, never that he's vegan. I've heard he's tried it but failed. Maybe now he is though?
 
 
Again, another example of why I love Morrissey.

Comparing these two deaths expresses how he feels about it- he challenges our percieved idea that human life is worth more than that of animals. We claim that this is so- but how can we prove it? What it is based on that is concrete- his position on the animal/human debate is no more valid than ours.

Do I agree? I don't know. But the controversy here is that my conventions are challenged, and it is no more than a vague emotivism that stops me from agreeing with him.

He's controversial. I like that. We might claim that it is insensitive, but then we must come to ask ourselves why this is.
 
 
 
lol

 

oh yeah, superb wonderful well explained counter-argument.

I suppose you don't consider some of the obvious euphemisms which distract people from having to feel guilty? "preparing" food as a substitute for killing for example
 
 
 
I've read all over the place that he's vegetarian, never that he's vegan. I've heard he's tried it but failed. Maybe now he is though?

 

I've had a look around and I can find nothing about him talking about veganism. Some sources call him a vegan, but I think only as a way of describing outspoken vegetarianism.   I assumed because Johnny Marr went vegan during the recording of Meat is Murder, Morrissey would must be. I don't know how he can make that comment while contributing to the suffering of animals through the dairy industry.

pfft i even call them dead animals myself, check my profile for example  

oh and preparing is what you do to something that's already dead. as far as i know "slaughterhouse" is in no way a euphemism

well not always, not in the case of a lot of seafood like lobsters etc. where they're killed minutes before you eat. lots of restaurants do this stuff.

and yeah, being as barbaric and vile as possible pretty much deals with the problem of guilt pretty easily too

So the voiceless=no rights? I'm no vegetarian but I definitely see the moral issues here.
 
 
I think Morrisey has a point in terms of that humans end lives like the Norweigan killer ended lives. But I believe that they contrast between being a selfish nutter and enabling us to survive as a species. Maybe it would be possible to ban the consumption of animal meat and eat only vegetables, but that would be an unrealistic aim for humanity. I guess it's like when people said they didn't care Amy Winehouse had died because of the massacre in Norway.

That's not what I said. i was directly replying to the other guy
 
 
 
He's vegetarian, not vegan.
And the comparison between human lives being taken and non-human animal lives being taken in this context isn't all that bad to make.
Consider the millions of animals that are killed in much more horrific manners and it becomes clear that, although comparing them has limited ground, it's hard to damn the killings and at the same time justify the meat industry in it's current form.

 

It's really not. You can't compare animals killed to be eaten to children murdered by a psycho who thinks he is saving the world.
 
 
All that lettuce must have driven him mad.

And meat is murder is such a **** song!

Why is it unrealistic? No-one is suggesting that we all stop eating meat at the same time, but it is possible for most people to give it up. It is much more efficient to eat vegetation directly rather than feed it to an animal and then eat them. It should be an aim of humanity to at least reduce meat consumption, even if you ignore animal welfare arguments altogether. It is unsustainable to continue to eat meat at the current rate. It is not in out long term interests to do so; we do not have the resources to do it.

Yeah, as far as I know. I actually like Meat is Murder, although I don't know anyone else who thinks the same. I was referring to 'Meat is Murder' the album though.
 
 
This is just stupid, that's like comparing the most unassociated things.

This reminds me of itunes trying to make a profit off amy winehouse death by getting people to buy her album.
 
 
 
I don't know how he can make that comment while contributing to the suffering of animals through the dairy industry.

 

Lets face it, how many people are really aware of what's going on in it? Organic and free-range have been thrown around so much, and spun into "these are happy cows/goats/chickens", so unless you stay skeptical and look at being vegan, you never find out what it's actually like. Even after starting I still didn't have a clue about a lot of it till going through some of the sites links got posted to on the chat thread.
 
 
 
When did he say that animals are more important than humans?

 

When he equalled human suffering to animals, keep up.

 
He thinks that the meat industry is worse than the Norway attacks because of the scale, not because the killing of animals is worse than humans.

 

Oh, well then lets forgive him for denouncing the suffering of his own species. Again another blanket term 'the meat industry'... Do you mean battery farms? Free range... yeah, chickens living free in fields eating fresh then being killed instantly is as humane as a massacre....Get real.

Dolphins use farming methods to catch and consume fishes, shall we protest against dolphins because they are smarter than their prey and the scale is larger than if a dolphin killed another few in a fight or something?

No, your well off again.

[QUOTE=ArtGoblin;33040598]There is no reason to consider human's suffering as more important to avoid than animal's, other than the arrogant belief we seem to have of humans as the only species worth preserving for its own sake.

I cannot take you seriously if you believe that. If you believe you are an evolved animal then self preservation is natural be it destructive and if your a 'we can eat green and save the world type' your just as arrogant because you put yourselves above animals and believe you are some sort of demigod and you are also selfish because you are not dealing with any other issues than those which interrupt your moral compass.

If you are protesting other issues then you can see why a much improved meat industry that realises it can be an evil trade but is improving conditions and making things as humane as possible. I guess they didn't mention any of that in the 1970's Peta video though as that would soften the movement.

And one more thing, the whole issue here is over population, if you dont even bother to adress or that then your ignorant as well.

 
It's not me who needs to reevaluate my morals.

 

Says the guy who thinks animals being killed humanely for food is the same as killing in cold blood in the name of politics.

**** off.
 
 
 
Oh and I'm sorry, I didn't read properly about you not eating processed food. It wasn't a personal attack anyway. I really don't care about whether other people are bothered by eating meat or not. It's just the double standard here in saying that the massacre in Norway is really very different to what happens every day in slaughterhouses.

 

Thats fine, i get quite heated in these little debates lol

I would only say its a double standard if you consider humans on the same scale as animals. People love to say they do but I think its a double standard to promote protecting the chickens and the cows and the lambs and the whales but not do anything for the spiders or the flies or the snakes.

There is also the argument that breeding livestock helps keep species that might be hunted to extinction alive. If white tigers or even Dodos were farmed perhaps, even though they were bred for food or some other product, might be around today or have stronger numbers... Im taking swings in the dark here...
 
 
What a ****.

I find it disappointing that someone who is supposedly passionate about animal 'rights' isn't vegan though. If you're going to come out with some of the stuff he says - that he knows is going to upset people - he should at least follow it through properly. I agree with what he says, but I have no respect for him if he's not willing to give up the things he enjoys for his principles. I understand why people are vegetarian and not vegan when they haven't looked beyond the obvious causes of death in the animal industry, but it comes across as hypocritical when someone is so vocal about the issue.
 
 
Morrissey's an ignorant, self-important **** who's done far more drugs than are good for you. What a surprise.

/thread
 
 
well, he's always been a bit of a douche

Well, no surprise that Morrissey has demonstrated is inexhaustible ability to be a completely insensitive and offensive prick.

Using the death of nearly 100 innocent people as a way to piggy back his aggressive views on meat-eating into the media is frankly disgusting.

Seriously Morrissey, people don't care about your pillocking views on this right now and the fact that you have in the past cynically used every trick in the book to get exposure for them means we all know what your motives are here.

I think it's more that the extremes of battery farming have upset these balances in the first place
 
 
I don't think he should have used the word 'nothing', that makes it sound like he doesn't give a **** about the lives lost. There also seems little point in making the statement, it will only alienate people.

Having said that, if you look at it logically, he is essentially right. The horrendous suffering that millions of animals experience in the meat production process certainly compares to the suffering experienced by the victims and their families. I think the suffering of one adult human outweighs that of a single cow, but when we consider the scale of the suffering you can understand the comparison.

I would argue that the meat production process is akin to the holocaust in terms of actual suffering.
 
 
I have no words...

I know a boy who was shot on that island (but he'll be OK). It was horrible. Had no news for hours.
 
 
 
When would be a tasteful time?
People have brought up the holocaust (which seems to have massive parallels with the egg industry) and get told they're not being tasteful.
So if he left it a year and then said that, do you think people consider it more tasteful?
I highly doubt it.
The stronger argument against him making statements like that is to bring into question their effectiveness, but even that's difficult.

 

Not right after the event, when families are suffering. To be told their loved ones lives aren't so much more worthwhile than chickens and pigs is not perfect is it?
He could make a general comparison about human and animal lives, but he's used the event specifically, and right after it. Insensitive would be an understatement.

MORRISSEY STATEMENT

The recent killings in Norway were horrific. As usual in such cases, the media give the killer exactly what he wants: worldwide fame. We aren't told the names of the people who were killed - almost as if they are not considered to be important enough, yet the media frenzy to turn the killer into a Jack The Ripper star is.... repulsive. He should be un-named, not photographed, and quietly led away.
The comment I made onstage at Warsaw could be further explained this way: Millions of beings are routinely murdered every single day in order to fund profits for McDonalds and KFCruelty, but because these murders are protected by laws, we are asked to feel indifferent about the killings, and to not even dare question them.
If you quite rightly feel horrified at the Norway killings, then it surely naturally follows that you feel horror at the murder of ANY innocent being. You cannot ignore animal suffering simply because animals "are not us."

That makes somewhat sense. But we are told the names of the victims. Their pictures and names are all over the Internet, all over the news (well at least here in Norway).
 
 
 
That actually makes total sense but only if you allow animals to be considered equal to some extend with humans.

 

I'm not sure I'd use the word 'equal'. I think once we accept that animals deserve some moral consideration based on their actual characteristics (rather than what species they belong to), it makes sense to draw comparisons between human and non-human animal massacres - even if a single chicken would have less moral weighing than a single human.

Hang on, let me clarify this;

You don't think that it is wrong to say, live on stage, that killing animals is a worse crime than killing children.

That is seriously, seriously worrying.

He has become entrenched in his views, but then Morrissey always has been because he is eccentric. As you get older those views usually do get more entrenched and sometimes do take on extreme forms. Morrissey always had existed on the fringes, so naturally...
 
 
I love The Smiths and his other music but literally everything else that comes out of Morrissey's mouth is complete bull****. It's a shame that such a good band is fronted by a complete tosser.

When you consider the billions of animals that are killed in much more painful ways then there's certainly that argument to be made, although even then I think the comment didn't make a moral comparison like that, perhaps I'm mistaken but wasn't the comment actually one that didn't say one was worse than another, but both are bad, without stating which is "worse" (which may not even be possible).

If you can't see that [argument] then that is seriously, seriously worrying.

A veggie crusader then.
I simply object because whatever you may think, the timing is a bit skew whiff.
Also I really dislike being lectured about vegitarianism or veganism. It's futile and just annoying. Much in the same way a non-smoker might try to lecture a smoker, or a Christian might try to lecture an atheist
 
 
 
He's proved that he's a knob in the past with his self-righteous ****e in interviews, but this just takes the biscuit. The man's a complete ****er.

When you say lectured about veg e tarianism or veganism, do you mean hearing about the morality of it?
If not then what [else] do you dislike about it?
If I were to give a lecture on where vegans get all sorts of different nutrients from and how it can be healthy without telling people that they should be vegan, would that be acceptable to you?
And would you be happy to lecture someone that they shouldn't do certain actions? Is that any more futile, or is it just that one happens to be more socially acceptable?

And lecturing smokers on the dangers of smoking is very different to lecturing an atheist, as there's evidence for why it's bad for us to smoke.
Lecturing people on the morality of veganism is different to both as there's both evidence, and directly necessarily harm to others.

The analogies don't really hold up unless you're just expressing a dislike of it, as opposed to a logical prescription of why it ought not to happen.

When you consider the billions of animals that are killed in much more painful ways then there's certainly that argument to be made, although even then I think the comment didn't make a moral comparison like that, perhaps I'm mistaken but wasn't the comment actually one that didn't say one was worse than another, but both are bad, without stating which is "worse" (which may not even be possible).

If you can't see that [argument] then that is seriously, seriously worrying.

 

Your argument is that animals should equal rights to humans? (Or t least the right not to be killed for food.) I see your argument, I just believe that it is one of most ridiculous proposals going.

Animals are not sentient, they rely pretty much on base instinct, their life is not worth anywhere near as much as human life is. I would rather kill 100 billion cows with a butter-knife than kill a human child with a morphine injection.

We place value on human life because we need other humans to survive to ensure our own survival, that is the crux of the matter. We do not require our food supply to remain alive in order for us to survive, in fact, we need to eat it to survive, and so it must be killed to increase our chances of survival. This concept extends to other humans who we are are enemies with, if killing an enemy increases your group's chances of survival, then killing humans is allowed, this is why killing your country's enemies in a war is not considered murder.

Basically, killing innocent children is a heinous crime, killing an animal for food, is not.
 
 
 
He has become entrenched in his views, but then Morrissey always has been because he is eccentric. As you get older those views usually do get more entrenched and sometimes do take on extreme forms. Morrissey always had existed on the fringes, so naturally...

 

Well I'm sure he's a wonderful artist (if you're into his sort of music, not my case) but lately he's strayed decisively out of the arts and into the field of "being a foolish self-important cock-holster". You make a much more eloquent and thoughtful defence of him than he deserves, so props to you anyhow.
 
 
Morrissey, what have you done?!  

Nah, I can see why he made such a comment but the timing was just all wrong which is why it comes across as highly insensitive.

I don't use that word in my arguments on this matter, it's a dirty word.

Are you high?
 
, they rely pretty much on base instinct, their life is not worth anywhere near as much as human life is. I would rather kill 100 billion cows with a butter-knife than kill a human child with a morphine injection.
 

What system of value are we putting on each life?
Why is species a criteria?
Is your inclination to kill 100 billion cows (not sure why they're being singled out) with a butter-knife than a human child with a morphine injection based simply on emotion, or logic as well?

quite a generlisation, it doesn't really hold up though does it. The marginal cases being the obvious prime example.
 
, that is the crux of the matter. We do not require our food supply to remain alive in order for us to survive, in fact, we need to eat it to survive, and so it must be killed to increase our chances of survival.
 

So do I need to eat animal products? And are you saying that societies reliance on the meat industry couldn't be diminished and perhaps totally extinguished over a few decades time?
 
This concept extends to other humans who we are are enemies with, if killing an enemy increases your group's chances of survival, then killing humans is allowed,
 

Balderdash! That's totally context dependent both within morality and it being socially acceptable.
 
this is why killing your country's enemies in a war is not considered murder.
 

That sounds like you're own logic rather than something based in a source.

 
Basically, killing innocent children is a heinous crime, killing an animal for food, is not.
 

But that doesn't mean that killing an animal arbitrarily for food is not heinous.
 
 
 
When you say lectured about veg e tarianism or veganism, do you mean hearing about the morality of it?
If not then what [else] do you dislike about it?
If I were to give a lecture on where vegans get all sorts of different nutrients from and how it can be healthy without telling people that they should be vegan, would that be acceptable to you?
And would you be happy to lecture someone that they shouldn't do certain actions? Is that any more futile, or is it just that one happens to be more socially acceptable?

And lecturing smokers on the dangers of smoking is very different to lecturing an atheist, as there's evidence for why it's bad for us to smoke.
Lecturing people on the morality of veganism is different to both as there's both evidence, and directly necessarily harm to others.

The analogies don't really hold up unless you're just expressing a dislike of it, as opposed to a logical prescription of why it ought not to happen.

 

I'll explain. I generally don't want to be lectured to by vegetarians or vegans. Why? Because I am a meat eater. I enjoy eating meat. I enjoy cooking it, I enjoy eating it in all it's varieties.

Eating meat does not mean I automatically condone violence against animals, nor the negative side of the various food organisations. I rarely eat fast food, especially high street fast food and the most well known brands so I can hardly be accused of supporting whatever injustices they may do and whatever they may and may not be connected to.

I am animal friendly and I am in favour of free range chickens and farms and freedom for animals whether they are going to be eaten or not. But I also like to eat meat. That does not make me a hypocrite. It is possible after all to be one who wishes for animal well being whilst eating meat.
The fact that I eat meat will probably never change. I just like it too much. I don't mind vegetarians and vegans. If that is the diet that they wish to follow for whatever reason then so be it.

An old friend of mine is a vegan, in fact not only is she but so is her sister and their mother. Their father is the only meat eater left. She is so because of her opinions on the meat industry. Well that's her choice. But mine are unlikely to change.
It's not always easy to find and buy meat that can be proven to be from an animal that lead a good and healthy life and that was treated well, but I do try.

And I do remain aware about animal welfare.

So when I get some vegetarian or vegan lecturing me and telling me I am not doing enough and generalising about the meat industry (even the parts that are good and that do much for animal wellbeing) I just switch off. Because the last thing I need is some self righteous ******** who thinks they know better than me bleat on.

I already get nagged enough in life, I don't need one more.

To answer your questions, no It's not that I don't want to hear about the morality of it or the lack thereof, because I know immorality exists in the meat industry.
What I don't want is someone telling me that every piece of meat that I buy and eat is fuelling an evil industry when they don't know the first thing about where I buy my meat and where it comes from.

If you were to lecture me on the benefits of a vegetarian or vegan diet I would probably listen and take note out of curiousity, however as I said I very much doubt I would ever give up meat. As long as a person is aware there is no need to give it up completely. Plus as a person currently on a diet, I see it as part of my balanced diet.

Am I happy to lecture people on things that I know are wrong? I have been known to in the past, however those have not been to do with anything like this, therefore it is not really a valid comparison.

I'm not expressing a dislike of vegans or veggies, just being lectured about it. I have no problems with either. I try and maintain a live and let live mentality. However there is a line.

And that line may be crossed when certain individuals take it upon themselves to turn crusader of what they think, in their opinion is the best diet and what they think a person should and should not eat based on their version and opinions on morality and a vast generalisation of an industry that is not entirely bad.

Sorry for the long response, I think I've covered everything.

Stating something is not a valid comparison =/= it not being a valid comparison. If you could state why it's not valid, that would be much better.

And what part of the meat industry is good for animal welfare?
Free range standards in this country are crap, organic standards from a welfare point of view are also crap. There maybe less suffering in those areas but you'd have to be a barbarian to claim that they're in anyway acceptable.

If opinion can be backed up with logic and evidence then I don't really understand what you've got against it being my opinion.

I've only heard of one part of the animal industry that is not bad in this country, and that's some Hindu Monks who make curry using cheese. The milk making cheese is taken in a very particular manner that actually doesn't do any harm to the cows.

Of course one of the issues with buying free range/organic from supermarkets though is transport. But even if they are killed on site, there are issues relating to any negative experiences the animals have because of the meat industry. Forced pregnancies/having offspring taken from them. Diseases (e.g. lameness) /infections from machinery )e.g. mastitis) /taking too many eggs/starving birds to shock them into another egg cycle/ breeding them in a manner that compromises the welfare of the off spring (or, selective breeding)/questionable killing methods (all killing methods are questionable really when you think about it).
I could go on.
you're making out as if you somehow don't contribute to animal suffering through eating meat, and putting all this "I care about animal welfare" stuff up. But the reality of it is either the rarest example of eating meat, so seems a bit farfetched, or different from what you're reporting.
