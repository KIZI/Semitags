I guess if this had been a tea party crowd it would be 24-7 news coverage of the hateful tea party attacking poor san fran nan.

sounds like she is hearing from her constituients.

You see that is what is supposed to happen.

Not shouting them down so no one can hear.

Not having them arrested for asking questions.

Not charging them money to be there.

Listening to them and them making their points without keeping anyone else from being heard.

You guys made big news because that is what you did and not just a normal exchange of ideas.
