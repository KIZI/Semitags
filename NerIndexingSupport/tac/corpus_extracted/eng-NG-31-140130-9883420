I think he was one of the victems of the injury bug. When they were
quickly running out of d-men because injuries were piling up they were
kind of bent over the barrel and had to do what they could.

Then again, I could be 100% wrong.
It happens a lot.

Don't remember why he was traded but here's who he was traded for
"He was traded by the Flyers, along with Eric Meloche, to the Chicago
Blackhawks on December 5, 2005 for Matt Ellison, who spent most of his time
in Philadelphia playing for the Philadelphia Phantoms and was traded to the
Nashville Predators on June 4, 2007 for future considerations."  Eric
Meloche was later traded back to the Flyers for a prospect.

I heard from a friend of a friend (believe it or not)...  that Patrick was
an asshole in the locker room.  He wanted more ice time, etc.. bitch and
whine premadonna...  It was too strong to say that he was a cancer in the
locker room - frankly he wasn't that important to be.  The organization just
got sick of him and shipped him off.

Attitude...  Personalty...  Same thing.  Once Hitch/Clarke, or any coach/gm
doesn't like you - most of the time they are gone (*except if the player is
a superstar, then sometimes they win and the coach is gone)
