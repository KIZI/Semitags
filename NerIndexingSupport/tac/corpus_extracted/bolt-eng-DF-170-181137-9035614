Is there anyone here that can help me get excited about the Red Sox chances this post season? Sure, I'll be watching the games and rooting for them, but I just don't see them getting past Anaslime. I hope I'm wrong. Can anyone give me a pep talk to get me going?

Negative. They will indeed get waxed by the Angels. Too bad too. I was hoping my Rays would get to beat the Sox down like a pinata. Oh well.

Angels have the best overall player in baseball. It's going to be ugly.
 
 
Let me cheer you up a bit, Mani. I feel for you...

 
Hamels Leads Phillies to Game One Win

Hamels retired the first 14 batters and the Phillies batted around in the third en route to the franchise's first post-season win since 1993, a 3-0 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers in Game 1 of the National League Division Series.

The Sox will be in the World Series, don't worry.

The WHITE Sox against the Chicago CUBS!
 

I can't wait to see an all Chicago WS-read it and weep, you heard it here first boys.

No one's beating L.A.

And the Cubbies don't exactly have history on their side, Echo. Although I'd be inclined to be a fan should the Phils get ousted. Unless it's by the Cubs, of course.

I'm pulling for TB, too. They really don't have any business being as good as they ended up. Good for them.

Well, they said the same thing about the Red Sox a few years ago, remember?

I honestly think this is the CUBS year, but hope springs eternal and all that....

TB is a good story, and if for some reason..........nah, not even going to say it!

An eye for an eye and all that............
 
 
Red Sox have beaten the Angels in 9 straight postseason series.

Red Sox have Jon Lester, Dice-K, and Josh Beckett going the first three games.

Those are three of the best pitchers in the MLB.
 
 
Oh and Echo, your Cubbies got trounced 7-2.

Delusional Cubbies fan. You poor poor soul.

And miss Jon Lester take the Angels to school hopefully? I think not!  

Besides, my team has more of a chance at this point in making it to the next round then yours.

Heh... nobody gives them a chance. Reason enough to root for them in my book.

If it wasn't for the Lowrie error, it'd be zero-zero still.

Hopefully Boston can come back to least tie it up. Hate to see a 1-0 loss that would end up being blamed on Lowrie.
 
 
And with one swing of the bat by Jason Bay, my Boston Red Sawx take a 2-1 lead.

No. It's hopeless. Obviously, you should just give up and end it all now.  
 
 
And the Red Sox win 4-1!!

What a great game and ninth by Paps. (Striking out the side like that)

Here's waiting for game 2 on friday.

Hope that game was a good enough pep talk Mani.

I really don't know. I don't watch MLB. I don't even know who else is in the playoffs. The teams here in Texas need to play in the 1AA so they can win.

At least Texas has football, right?

the angels have arod? (i hate the guy, but he is the best all around player. pujols is the best hitter though)

Hey zipper lips, can I assume that this is you telling me I'm now worth the effort?

Actually, I was trying to bore myself back to sleep, and there WAS the off-chance that you'd actually do as I said. *shrug*

Football and basketball.

I've always actually liked the Astros but they're bigger choke artists than Danny White, and the guy vying for his title Tony Romo.

But I rarely watch any sports on TV other than college football anymore. The officiating in pro sports pisses me off enough that every anger management center in Bexar County gets put on alert.  
 
 
Poor Cubbies.  

But on a funny note, did anyone else see the clip of Manny elbow deep and digging for nose-gold?

Delusion
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

A delusion is commonly defined as a fixed false belief and is used in everyday language to describe a belief that is either false, fanciful or derived from deception. In psychiatry, the definition is necessarily more precise and implies that the belief is pathological (the result of an illness or illness process). As a pathology it is distinct from a belief based on false or incomplete information or certain effects of perception which would more properly be termed an apperception or illusion.

Example #1 of Delusional: A cubs fan.  

Sorry Echo, but the Dodgers have smashed the Cubs in the Cubs own stadium very handily.
 
 
Well, the Sox got by Anaheim but I'm still not filled with exhuberant optimism. The Angels didn't look at all like the team that went 8-1 against the Sox in the regular season (5-1 at Fenway). In fact, the underachievement of their play would seem remarkable if it weren't for the show put on by the Bad News [baby] Bears. If I thought Beckett was 100% I'd feel a lot better about the Tampa series. And no Lowell kinda blows too.

Shit, I forgot about Lowell. TB/Phi? Has a nice ring to it!
 
 
Have fun at the NL Champs parade regardless.

Guess I'll root for the White Sox now since my Cubbies broke my heart again.

you forget youk was originally a 3B, plusLowrie can play 3B as well. kotsay and casey both have decent bats and skills at 1B and you can always shuffle youk back to 1B in late innings if needed, unless you're john mcnamara. TB's had a great year, but the coach is about to turn into a pumpkin
 
 
Phils take game 1. And of course, ESPN hates it.  
 
 
I knew you could count on at least one bad inning from D-Lowe!

I forget nothing. Missing a prolific clutch hitter, and last year's WS MVP from the line-up hurts no matter how you spin it. That said, Go SOX baby!

yeah, it hurts, but it's not fatal. go SOX.

probably sobered up early.

Apparently you can count on one bad inning from each pitcher we'll be facing. We'll see how far that gets us.
 
 
Wow, ESPN and Fox are hating life right now with LA down 2-0. Philly gets 0 love. It's all about our "quirky" bandbox park, and how LA is "beating themselves". You wouldn't even know the Phillies existed if they weren't forced to show you the other team wearing red and white, in the highlights.

I wonder if it's got anything to do with Rupert Murdoch being a previous owner of the Dodgers?
