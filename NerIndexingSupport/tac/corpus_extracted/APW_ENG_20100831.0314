A lawyer has called for treason charges to be laid against any Pakistan player found guilty in cricket's latest match-fixing investigation.

Ishtiaq Ahmed Chaudhry tells the Associated Press he was deeply hurt after a British newspaper alleged Pakistan bowlers Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir were paid to deliberately bowl no-balls during last week's fourth test against England.

In a petition Tuesday to the Lahore High Court, Chaudhry asked that if the charges were proved, guilty players should be banned for life, have their assets seized and have treason proceedings opened against them.

Lahore High Court chief justice Khawaja Sharif has asked for a government report into the matter by Sept. 7.
