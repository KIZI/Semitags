 
 
HEY!......are we still counting the Lybia mission in days?
 
 
'cause we were PROMISED by the Ineptness In Chief that it would only last days. Not weeks or months, but days......Seems like we'll be coming up on a year before too long.

What up with that shit.........And why does Obama seem not to ever mention it anymore, seeing as though it's costing us boatloads of friggin money on a daily basis?

Oh, and did we remove Qaddafi Duck from power yet?.........One would never know judging by the crickets chirping in Obama's inept mind.
 
 
Shhhhhhhhh dont wake up the masses with unnecessary facts
 
 
Where are the protests?
 
 
Installing an Islamist regime isn't easy ya know.
 
 
Who would have ever thought we would back Al qaeda in overthrowing a leader.

Yep, strange days indeed under the Ineptness In Chief.
 
 
It got lost in economic fracas. We have nobody on the ground (that we know of) so it is a non issue to the masses. Get used to it because that is the future. Wars will be done by remote controlled aircraft or missiles only. Afghanistan is just reinforcing that concept!

I have no problem with that but lets prioritize our limited funds shall we
 
 
You don't hear a word about it in the MSM either. Why is that? An un-informed public would like to know............

They just arnt used to being on the receiving end of chit like this:

They have to kill libyan civilians.
 
 
Libia?
 
 
 
Libia?

 

Yeah, libya, poser.

You know, that country your hero invaded and said it would only take a matter o' "days" to complete........You know, poser, that place your hero and yourselves never seem to want to mention anymore?

What up with that shit, poser?.......Watching all those young teen lezbo's on GLEE got ya' a lil' distracted, or what?
 
 
Our military mission was over after 60 days, as promised. Dittoheads!!
 
 
 
Where are the protests?

 

 
 
 
It's a police action, and we're barely involved. Khaddaf is being forced out with the fewest deaths possible, dumazzes. Keep trying to make trouble, Khaddafi lovers...jfc.
 
 
Really? Our military mission was over in 60 days?

Would you care to prove this?

While you're at it let us know just how much this little action is costing us....

Since no one else is telling us why don't you?
 
 
 
It's a police action, and we're barely involved. Khaddaf is being forced out with the fewest deaths possible, dumazzes. Keep trying to make trouble, Khaddafi lovers...jfc.

Hey now, those American "cops" used jets and bombs in Vietnam for years while police actioning.
 
 
So let me see if I got this straight. When dems use the military is policing. When the gop does it, its war mongering
 
 
Are you that dumb, ir just ridiculously disengenuous. 0 casualties vs 160 k?

What I don't get is why the Right doesn't overwhelmingly support the Libya thing, I mean,

what's the difference between Khadaffi and Saddam?
 
 
What happened to the war protesters?

That petered out when their 0ssiah took over, huh?
 
 
I guess "Blood for Oil" is acceptable now...
 
 
 
What I don't get is why the Right doesn't overwhelmingly support the Libya thing, I mean,

what's the difference between Khadaffi and Saddam?

 

What threat was Libya to the US?

Was Qaddafi constantly threatening us?

Was Qaddafi purposely faking a WMD program?

Was Qaddafi continually threatening to re-invade one of our key allies?

Syria is now slaughtering their people en masse, and we do nothing about it. Do we just now pick and choose who we save from slaughter?

Does the Ineptness In Chief have any clue yet as to who these "so-called" rebels are?

Ya' think it's about time the Ineptness In Chief gets in touch with his good buddy, Tony Rezko, to set up another fraudulent real estate deal?........'cause that inept clown and ham hipped wife are gonna need a new place to live come '12!

Oh, and btw, where the fuck is Qaddafi?

It's called a TYPO, dipshit.

Now, do care to address the issue that your hero lied his ass off and was completely clueless, as usual, about this mission.

What's the cost up to now?
 
 
 
Since you can't spell the name of the country in question, can you at least find it on a map?

Yeah, the rising civilian deaths caused by US, to back a bunch o' terrorists is perfectly acceptable, eh?

You are beyond stupid.  
 
 
Excuse me Butt i always thought the Sodomizer kept Iran in check and taking him out gave the Iranians a huge advantage butt who gives a chit now.

Ya'll just keep repeating the narratives your task masters shove down you throats about what "the other side" thinks, twats.

Yes we DO have boots on the ground. My son was home on leave recently and we talked about that....he kinda laughed and said "ya...there's lots of them". Our fearless leader lied to us AGAIN???  
 
 
No, your son is misled.
 
 
 
No, your son is misled.

 

No, he's not.......There are boots on the ground, They are known as spotters. There are also CIA elements on the ground. As has already been admitted by the DOD.
 
 
CIA, yes. Not boots. Before your anecdote spreads around the pub dupe world...
 
 
And yet no one can tell us just what this so called action is costing us.....

I've looked...........crickets.........
 
 
 
CIA, yes. Not boots. Before your anecdote spreads around the pub dupe world...

 

Spotters are military........CIA is doing missions with the terrorists Obama has chosen to support. No different than boots whatsoever.

Christ, educating Obamabots is a never ending task.
 
 
Terrorists, fighting againt Gaddafi? Absolute idiocy. Obama's a GD boy scout, and lies about nothing. The dupes are just whacked. Yes, you. You got nothing but stupid rumors and lies to repeat.
 
 
11000 civilians killed and counting!!!!!
 
 
 
Terrorists, fighting againt Gaddafi? Absolute idiocy. Obama's a GD boy scout, and lies about nothing. The dupes are just whacked. Yes, you. You got nothing but stupid rumors and lies to repeat.

 

Yes fool, terrorists fighting against Qaddafi who was actively rooting out the terrorists, and taking away their ability to establish safe havens within his borders.

So yes, we are supporting the very terrorists who seek to destroy us. It's a fact.

Christ man, even members of his administration fully admit they haven't a clue as to who most of these so-called rebels truly are.
 
 
Obama tell the truth about anything. Now that is a joke!!! Where is the outrage from the left... If this was Bush it would be all over the news saying he lied and was unconstitutional for him to even going in without Congress ok. But because the main stream media thinks he the next Jesus wont say anything about it.. Bias much I think so  
 
 
And neither do you, Rush. Just stupid rumours.
 
 
 
No, your son is misled.

 

My son is now with special forces...and he has No REASON to lie about it. You are the one that's miss led!
 
 
Tell me an Obama lie, dumbazz. They always turn out to be predictions that Pubs blocked, or total BS like THIS.
 
 
How much is this Libyan "Action " costing us?
 
 
 
 
No, your son is misled.

 

My son is now with special forces...and he has No REASON to lie about it. You are the one that's miss led!

 

Ya' don't just go into a mission blind. You have special op's spotters on the ground directing fire from day one.

We have never gone into ANY conflict without first putting boots on the ground.

Ya' must understand CJ, up here on this board you are dealing with many from the Nintendo generation. They are clueless as to how things work in the real world.....They just think that these Drones are flying around spotting targets through a camera and then firing. That is surely not the case........There ARE US military boots on the ground directing. Anybody who thinks otherwise is a clueless idiot, who has never served, and has no idea what missions entail.

It's like the many fools who bought into Obama's claims that all combat forces were withdrawn from Iraq.........A blatant lie meant to deceive and pretty up the situation to the american people.......'cause yes, there are many combat troops still on the ground in Iraq, engaging in combat operations. That is a fact.

BS. LOL!

"How much is this Libyan "Action " costing us?" Not much. NO HOSTILE ACTION anymore, Gaddafi lovers.
 
 
 
BS. LOL!

"How much is this Libyan "Action " costing us?" Not much. NO HOSTILE ACTION anymore, Gaddafi lovers.

 

Yeah, drones firing and cruise missiles launching are not hostile actions.

Seriously, are you really that clueless, or just pulling our legs by acting so clueless?
 
 
 
How much is this Libyan "Action " costing us?

 

To give just a lil' perspectice on the cost, Sarge.............The 200 or so Tomahawks we've fired in thus far cost around a million apiece.

Thus far, we're approaching a billion with no end in site.

And what was the reasonong going in?.......Oh yeah, to keep Qadaffi from killing their "citizens."
 
 
yeah I know about what the tomahawks cost. My point is that there is nothing out there telling us what the US is spending. I found dozens of articles about what the UK was spending on it.... But the US news????????????? Nothing............
 
 
Yup, the bozo dupes on here and the kid in special forces know all the top secret stuff...

"I found dozens of articles about what the UK was spending on it.... But the US news????????????? Nothing............" Maybe because the UK and France are doing EVERYTHING now, and If the USA did anything, the pubs would impeach Obama. Knuckleheads.
 
 
 
How much is this Libyan "Action " costing us?

 

In Lives....or just in Money?
 
 
Libya, I guess since we were not using enough munitions in Iraq now we had to find someplace to shoot em off to keep our MIC buddies happy.
Can't have a slowdown in our govt purchasing missles and bombs and such.
 
 
How many conspiracy theories you knuckleheads have going now? LOL!
 
 
My post a consipracy theory?

Just an economic reality.

Really, so the Pentagon is lying when it says that OUR drones and cruise missiles are still being used, you dumbass?

Get back to your Playstation. The adults are having a conversation here.
 
 
We spent about 100 million on the first cruise missle bombardment. Just on missles alone.
think of the jobs and profit that makes back home   All paid for with borrowed money.
 
 
 
yeah I know about what the tomahawks cost. My point is that there is nothing out there telling us what the US is spending. I found dozens of articles about what the UK was spending on it.... But the US news????????????? Nothing............

 

According to DOD back in March, the cost at that point was around 600 million.

And for what?........Oh yeah, to keep Qadaffi from killing citizens.

Friggin' sad state of affairs in this country to be sure.

Well that and 600 mill or so to the weapons industries.

You are so incredibly mindlessly uninformed it would be laughable if it weren't so damn sad. The actions taken in Libya were in complete violation of the Wars Powers Act. Obama circumvented Congressional approval in lieu of UN approval.

Also, though not widely reported, continued US bombing has been on going for months.

I guess wisdom and intelligence isn't always acquired with age

You claim you are 60 years of age, but you have the class and maturity of a 5 year old.

Continued NATO bombing of Libya has been ongoing. And if you believe that NATO action is occurring without direct US involvement, you are even more uninformed than I thought. Show me a link where US isn't firing cruise missiles.

Do you have anything insightful or intelligent to say?

"As it becomes clear that the battle for Libya will not be won quickly, the burden shouldered by the United States will increase, both militarily and financially. Other NATO partners such as the United Kingdom and France have recently made drastic cuts to defense spending as part of austerity packages meant to improve deficits in the wake of the euro zone debt crisis. According to experts, this has left both countries scrambling to find the resources necessary to fight a protracted conflict. Diplomatic sources at the Berlin meeting said that Britain could not sustain its level of military action, and that other nations needed to contribute more."

From YOUR article:

"The Fire Scout was unarmed and conducting a surveillance mission for NATO when officials suddenly lost radar contact with it.

The U.S. has been providing drones for the Libyan conflict, including armed Predators that have been used to strike targets on nearly 70 missions.

A coalition including France, Britain and the United States began striking Gadhafi's forces under a United Nations resolution to protect civilians on March 19. NATO assumed control of the air campaign over Libya on March 31.

Get a grip. Look in a mirror and see what a brain washed Pub Dupe looks like...

April 22, 2011|By David S. Cloud, Los Angeles Times
President Obama has approved the use of armed Predator drone aircraft to launch airstrikes against ground targets in Libya, the latest sign of mounting concern in Washington that the NATO-led air campaign has failed to stop Moammar Kadafi's forces from shelling the besieged city of Misurata and other populated areas.

That's from APRIL 22- you'll notice there are no recent articles like that- BECAUSE THEY STOPPED BECAUSE OF THE WPA.

So, to review- NO BOMBINGS BY USA for MONTHS!! Stupid GD Pub DUPES!! STUPID!!!

Hardly full of shytte, Scooter. Are you a lefty looney, or a dittohead righty, anyway (Just noticed Malibu. Dharlie Sheen, or Charleton Heston?)

Thank god for the NYTimes, otherwise it's almost impossible to get the truth from our controversy mad media, let alone Faux Noise.
Anyway all your BS about women and children being massacred by cruise missiles and bombers used by the USA is WRONG, and all your sympathy for Gaddafi is incredible. He's on his way out.

Dittoheads' hateful, misled, hysterical opposition to ANYTHING Obama does is ridiculous and scary. The world is aghast. Look at p. 1 of this thread and see what we're dealing with. See also health reform, the debt ceiling, jobs bills, etc, etc.
 
 
This debacle is costing American Taxpayers several $Billions. And for what? To help Al Qaeda Libyan Rebels seize control of Libya? This War made no sense form the very beginning. And he didn't go to Congress either. So this War is also Unconstitutional. It's just another very sad blunder from this inept Administration.
 
 
 
 
Our military mission was over after 60 days, as promised. Dittoheads!!

 

No it wasn't retard, over 40 percent of all bombing missions were and are conducted with America aircraft and crews. But since the OBAMA ordered it the press isn't interested in reporting it.

 

Absolute BS. Just refueling and reconaisance, defensive taking out of AA very seldomly. And cost will top a billion, sometime in Sept.- Cheap to save many lives and get rid of a terrorist dictator in a pivotal area of the Arab Spring. Turn off the BS.

And he didn't go to Congress either. So this War is also Unconstitutional. It's just another very sad blunder from this inept Administration.

 

It was only to protect french oil.

Yea this War is all about Oil. But will these costs really be worth it in the end? Taxpayers are being billed several $Billions for this debacle. It's just very sad.

But it IS within range of French planes in France.

We have a similar event occurring and no response form the US, well we are thinking about sending a strongly worded letter.
 
 
Give us some more articles from April, or about unarmed drones. Pub dupe. Or are you a loonie Cal. Greenie?
 
 
Again, the cost hasn't reached a billion yet, and US offensive action ended within WPA limits. UNLIKE every other Presidents' FOR YEARS. Just all negative, all BS Pub propaganda. all Pub Dupes. Or loonie Cal. Greens.
 
 
 
 
 
Our military mission was over after 60 days, as promised. Dittoheads!!

 

No it wasn't retard, over 40 percent of all bombing missions were and are conducted with America aircraft and crews. But since the OBAMA ordered it the press isn't interested in reporting it.

So, armed predator drones are now capable of providing in-flight refueling?.......Interesting!

Tell ya' what, since you're such an obviously gullible lil' fool..........I've got some prime beachfront property in Palm Springs, complete with private beach, coconut laden palms, and a really sexy hula girl who can shake those hips like a fuckin' 10 on the richter scale....Wanna buy it. I'll give ya' a great deal!

Let me know, Bones.
 
 
"To help Al Qaeda Libyan Rebels seize control of Libya?"

Total bigotted BS, Glenn/Rush.
 
 
Who said anything about drones refueling anything, dumbazz dittohead? And OUR drones aren't armed. We're probably making a tidy profit on the armed NATO ones. Getting the pecture yet, or do you want a diagram??

BS......I already provided the link with the FACTS that we were engaging in "hostile" actions LOOOOOOOOOOOOONG after the sixty day buffer zone.

I'll bet you're dumb enough to actually believe there are no combat troops left in Iraq also, eh?

The gullibilty of you Obamabot loons is friggin' comical.  
 
 
Interesting take. This Libyan War isn't only about Oil. It's also about Gaddafi's plans for Currency...

I'm now more inclined to believe this War is more about Gaddafi's plans for Currency.

Hey Slick, you're the fool who is up here claiming that we are only conducting refueling and supply operations, when I have provided links with he FACTS to show that you are full o' shit, and that Obamaboy clearly violated the WPR by conducting hostile actions as recently as mid June.......It's all been admitted to by the DOD.

Now, how about you provide some links to back up your claims.....'cause all we're hearing from you is absolutely nothing to back up your loony liberal Obamabot drivel.
 
 
 
'cause we were PROMISED by the Ineptness In Chief that it would only last days. Not weeks or months, but days......Seems like we'll be coming up on a year before too long.

What up with that shit.........And why does Obama seem not to ever mention it anymore, seeing as though it's costing us boatloads of friggin money on a daily basis?

Oh, and did we remove Qaddafi Duck from power yet?.........One would never know judging by the crickets chirping in Obama's inept mind.

 

HEY!......are we still counting the Lybia mission in days?

Nowdays we're counting US debt and presidential golf days.
 
 
This war was about saving lives, then to get Gaddafi out, for lots of great reasons. And he IS on his way. Cheapest and most humane way possible.

Jester, when you finally found a pertinent link, it said we had done a few defensive attacks on AA. Remain calm- acceptable under WPA.
 
 
And is Gaddafi really any worse than Saddam Hussein,Assad,Kim Jong Il,or the Mullahs in Iran? Why him? Why now? The answer is Oil & his plans for Currency. There is nothing "Humanitarian" about bombing & killing Libyans. This War is just more Unconstitutional Bullshit.

What this was, at the time this fiasco of a failure was launched, was another attempt by this inept president to deflect away from recently reported failings.......It's Obama's Modus Operandi.

This wasn't about saving lives.

If that cocksucker actually cared about "saving lives", we'd be in Syria and Somalia doing the exact same thing.

But then, I guess that inept fool just picks and chooses when he'll make himself look like such a caring humanitarian.

Not enough Oil in Syria & Somalia.

I've provided the proof and facts through links.

You've provided absolutely NOTHING to back up your claims.

You are only proving that you're the epitomy of an Obamabot fool, who will ignore FACTS presented, and can provide absolutely NOTHING to back up your drivel.

Unless you can provide links that fully back up your argument as I clearly have, then you must be considered as having zero credibility up here, and are nothing but a hack troll.
 
 
Everyone should check this video out. The more i research this,the more it becomes evident that Gaddafi's Currency plan scared the shit out of the Powers that Be.

Make Love Not War
 
 
Gaddafi himself said he was going to massacre EVERYONE in Bengazi. Unlike Assad, he had NO FRIENDS anywhere, had a much smaller country strung along the sea within range of French airbases, etc, etc. But go on with your ignorant dittohead conspiracy theories and hater talk. Pub dupes.
 
 
Jester, you proved nothing except the USA has attacked a few AA batteries, a defensive measure allowed by WPA. Not exactly the "slaughter of women and children with cruise missiles and bombers". LOL!
 
 
I still don't see how some can argue Gaddafi is worse than Saddam Hussein,Assad,Kim Jong Il,the Military Junta in Burma,or the Mullahs in Iran. Libya was absolutely no threat to the U.S. or its neighbors in Africa. In fact,Gaddafi had great relationships with just about all of his African neighbors. This War makes no sense unless you accept that it's all about Oil and Gaddafi's Currency plan. That's just how i see it anyway.
 
 
No, he had no real friends anywhere, and said himself he was about to send his army to massacre his second largest city, and his country is PERFECT for attacking. AND he was a terrorist. Booosh was willing to give him a pass as a fellow oilman, not BHO.
 
 
 
We should pull up some old TM and RW threads that claim it was only going to last a short time unlike Iraq and cost us nothing... again like Iraq. BTW Iraq is still going on.

 

when congress was debating the Iraq approval they were told by the administration that it would only cost 40 billion and take maybe 6 months tops.

We were flying Bombers from Oklahoma at 10k per hour operating costs and bombing Libya.
160 or so cruise missles at around 1.5 million each were launched in the first days, etc.

Nope just pointing out lies our govt tells us.
I am against all of the current wars.
Or actions.

Besides the other 2 are not earlier debacles, they are still current debacles 10 years later.
 
 
 Libya rebel feuds threaten Gaddafi mission 

Im sure everything will be just fine.

 

Sad how you have to go overseas to find real news now.
