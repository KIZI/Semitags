Seeking her third grand slam victory of the year, Serena Williams withstood a strong test from Maria Jose Martinez Sanchez of Spain 6-3, 7-5 to advance to the fourth round of the U.S. Open on Friday.

It was an awkward match in Arthur Ashe Stadium for defending champion Williams, full of counterpunches from the game's biggest power hitter.

"I heard a guy in the crowd saying, `Stop hitting lobs,' so I didn't hit any more lobs after that," Williams said. "My lob was not working today."

Receiving at 5-all in the first set, Williams chipped back serves, made a few passing shots and found herself at deuce for the eighth time in a game that lasted 12 minutes. Martinez Sanchez finally wore out, double-faulting twice in a row to give up the break and, essentially, the match.

Tenth-seeded Flavia Pennetta also moved on, defeating Aleksandra Wozniak of Canada 6-1, 6-1. No. 8 Victoria Azarenka of Belarus fell to No. 26 Francesca Schiavone of Italy 4-6, 6-2, 6-2.

The men's draw continued to go almost strictly to form, with No. 6 Juan Martin del Potro, No. 7 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga each winning in straight sets. With the third round nearly complete, none of the top 10 seeded men has lost a set.

"It was a quick match. I played great," Tsonga said after his 7-5, 6-3, 6-4 win over Finland's Jarkko Nieminen.

No. 16 Marin Cilic, from two sets down against American Jesse Levine, No. 17 Tomas Berdych and No. 24 Juan Carlos Ferrero also won.

Williams and Martinez Sanchez were meeting for the first time since the French Open third round, when Williams won in three sets. After that match, Williams said she hit a ball she thought went off her Spanish opponent's arm, and accused Martinez Sanchez of cheating by not acknowledging it.

There were no signs of animosity during their rematch on a cloudless, comfortable, 80-degree (27-degree C) afternoon. Williams said that episode did not motivate her, nor would she admit to having less respect for her 43rd-ranked opponent because of what happened at Roland Garros.

"I only can speak for me," she said. "I try to be very professional, extremely professional in my job. That's what I'm here to do. And win, I hope."

Williams, who came to her news conference wearing a T-shirt that said "Can't spell dynasty without nasty," lost only seven games in her first two matches. She doubled that total on Friday in the kind of match that very few have to play on the women's -- or men's -- circuit these days. Serve-and-volley is out, power groundstrokes are in.

"Every time I play, I say, `I'm going to be a serve-and-volleyer," Williams said. "I even used to like Martina Navratilova and John McEnroe. But I couldn't play more opposite than them. I love groundstrokes, I love rallies, I love hitting the ball."

Williams, bidding for her fourth U.S. Open title, Williams next meets 22nd-seeded Daniela Hantuchova, who defeated American Vania King 6-2, 6-2.
