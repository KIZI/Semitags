3.9 million per year?  I'd definitely call that overpaid.  Gagne is 5
million and Sharp 3.9?

Not really ridiculous, since he was never really given a chance in
Philly.  Sharp has 22 goals and 14 assists at this point in time and is
on pace for 39 goals.  That's currently more goals than any Flyer on the
roster.  On top of that he's a +11....we can't say that about our
leading goal scorer on the team.  Sharp is currently the league leader
in short handed goals.  Who wouldn't want to keep a guy around who can
score more PK goals than most guys on the power play?

Anyhow, he's just 26 years old so he should be around for another 10
years, so I can't see any reason why the Blackhawks shouldn't lock him
up for a few years.

No we can't because our leading goal scorer if +12.
I'll also take our leading goal scorers 50 points to Sharps 36, and
give up the two goal difference anytime.
I don't think he's worth $4 million per, but time will tell.

Oooops, I was thinking Briere.  I didn't realize that Richards had
surpassed Briere in the goal-scoring category.  Anyhow I'm not even
going to try to compare Sharp and Richards.  The Flyers got a great deal
on Richards with his sudden rise to stardom as a solid 2 way player/team
leader.  My point about Sharp is that he's a bonifide goal scorer who is
young *and* he is obviously a 2 way player who is going to net more
goals that he and his team-mates allow while he is on the ice.  Assists
are nice, but there are 2 assists on each goal, three players get
points, but only one nets the puck.  IMO goals should be counted for 2
points first assists as one point and second assists as a half point.
That's the reality of the worth of a player in the points system.  I'm
not sure how it was established that there should be second assists or
that an assist should be worth as much as a goal.  In some cases that is
absolutley true, but in most cases an assist is incidental, in nearly
all cases a second assist is incidental or even *accidental*.  So while
it's good to see as many assists as goals, I'll take the guy with the
hot hand any day and make sure he gets the puck all game long.

I would take Sharp over Briere though for the money.  Richards?
Fuggedaboutit.

Heh...I knew exactly who you were talking about so was having some fun
with it.
I don't have too big a problem with Briere. He's a good player and
he's proven to be a good playoff performer. At least against the
Flyers anyways. So he had damn well better be good for them.
Kind of overpaid for a second line center, but hey, if you can have
more than point a game guys up the middle in your top two lines you
are doing OK. It would be nice to see a little more defensive
responsibility out of Briere. I still think him and Gagne could be
very good together once Simon has worked himself back into game shape.

The point is that you can't always go by numbers.  Sharp gets all the ice
time he wants in Chicago, including power play time.  I give him kudos for
being a plus, and the shorties show effort.  But given a team with a system,
he's average.  I also don't think you can say the Flyers didn't give him a
chance.  I don't know what the ice time shows, but I remember seeing him on
the ice plenty, and doing awfully little.  A known complainer, I think
rewarding him for one good half season is simply ridiculous.  If you can
take anyone's best half season, and then do a lot of multiplication like
you're trying to do, you end up with all sorts of ridiculous stuff.  You
have to look at the actual player, too.

They'll regret this one, trust me.

P.S.  On the other hand, I think Boyes's numbers are much more real.  I
simply don't know what Boston was thinking when trading him.

He was about a 7-9 minutes per game player for the Flyers playing on
probably the third line IIRC.  I didn't do the math, that's what i read
that he was forcasted to produce for the year.  Chicago took a chance
and a huge risk.  Sometimes that pays off and sime times it doesn't.

 

Who and what are his numbers?

He's got 27 goals, 13 assists, and is a plus 7 for the Blues.  Boston traded
him for Dennis Wideman last February.  The deal made no sense to me.  Boyes
had 26 g and 43 assists and was a plus 11 for Boston in 05-06.  He's only 25
and just getting better.

Wideman?

After Toronto, Boston has to be the worst GM'ed team in hockey.

Seems like that would be like trading Carter for Wideman.  Statistically
scoring wise, Widen in the top 33 of the NHL.  He's a +10, so maybe
that's what's needed in Boston.  I haven't seen him play and I don't
know what effect he has on the team chemistry but numerically he's
pretty sound.  I don't think I would trade Carter for him, but the
Flyers may just have to part with one of *their* top favorite forwards
to secure the back end of the ice.  It'll be painful because generally
when a defensman is doing his job it's just boring hockey, but when a
forward does the primary part of his job the horns go off and the light
turns on.  (I'm easily entertained).

Hey, what's Chris Chelios up to these days?  I think he's old enough to
play on my team now. ;-)
