Football journalist Gabriel Marcotti is in the 5live studio and says
Atletico Madrid are yet to conclude a deal for Juan Roman Riquelme so
there is hope for Everton, but he adds the player does not want to be
in Europe so it may not be the best piece of business. Riquelme has
not been seen on Merseyside.
