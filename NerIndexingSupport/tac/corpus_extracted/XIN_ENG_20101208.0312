Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has decided to start the selling of ICC Cricket
World Cup 2011 tickets from Jan. 1, an official said Wednesday.

Rabid Imam, BCB's senior communications officer, told Xinhua that the decision
was made at a meeting of the World Cup's local organisers on Tuesday late night
here in capital Dhaka.

He, however, said ticket selling process has not been finalized, which BCB will
very shortly inform all through its website.

The World Cup Cricket-2011 will be jointly hosted by Bangladesh, India and Sri
Lanka. Bangladesh will host eight matches as well as the inaugural ceremony of
the World Cup on Feb. 19.
