A packed shopping mall in the southern US state of Georgia was evacuated after
Santa Claus overheard a rather odd elf mention high-powered explosives, police
said Thursday.

"At around 7:00 pm Wednesday,  William Caldwell III -- he's 45 years old, five
feet tall (1 meter 58 cm) and 108 pounds (49 kilograms) -- was dressed as an elf
and waiting to see Santa Claus at our mall," Captain James Callaway of the
police criminal investigations unit in the town of Morrow, told AFP.

"Santa Claus was alarmed by the fact that this grown man was dressed as an elf.
He was also alarmed because he overheard him saying 'dynamite' two times,"
Callaway said.

Santa notified security, who apprehended Caldwell and evacuated several thousand
people who were shopping at the mall, Callaway said.

Two bomb squads were called in to dispose of bags belonging to the elf, which
had been left near Santa's grotto.

The bags were found to contain nothing other than some personal effects: some
clothing, and "an elf hat and a Santa hat," said Callaway.

Caldwell is being held in a county jail on charges of "terroristic threats and
acts and creating a false public alarm."
