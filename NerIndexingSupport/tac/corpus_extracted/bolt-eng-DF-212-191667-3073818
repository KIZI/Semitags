I am really curious. Why is it that you only have to call somebody a communist or socialist to discredit somebodies ideas or point of views in the states( this is at least the impression I get for example from this board)

As far as I know no communist regime ever occupied the US or ever really did it harm. Why is it exactly that you think that the very idea of communism is so bad (please don´t only look on the failed attemps as the Soviet Union or China etc. )

From a human point of view it is mucgh easier to discredit capitalism look at child workers, workers living conditions in the 18th century.... The very idea of socialsim changed the world for a better place for all of us. Why this hostility toward anything which smells of "left "thinking ?
 
 
Because communists are idiots.

Like you.
 
 
agree with somebra, why are the americas so distrubuted about socialists politics? it is not the current downtroden in the usa who are a shinning example of the destruction of the poor thru capitalists? i have spent 4 years in the usa in which i see nothing but greed and materialism while the poor and mostly blacks are discriminated against. in the usa if you are not black you must be green with money. i say now capitalism raises a bigger flag of greed.
 
 
AAAAAAA!!!!!!!
Ahem!

/hail to mega-expert  Me - entering in da house!/
Communism und Capitalism will evolve with time in a truly reasonable union.
For now, this is impossible.
If humanity evade full scale nuke-fun than we will have a chance to see such union.

I had a good saying in my mind concerning this matter from Mel Brooks History of The world, but I forgot it
 
 
It is a logical fallacy to discredit somebody's argument by attacking the messenger. Thus is it is possible for a communist to be right about something that has nothing to do with economics. But if the discussion is on economics, then a communist is discredited simply by being a communist, because the economic theory behind communism is complete and utter bull.
 
 
"Thus is it is possible for a communist to be right about something that has nothing to do with economics."

Care to give an example?
 
 
I'm just saying that being a communist does not mean that a person cannot be right about something that has nothing to do with communism. Afterall, communists are people (sort of), and nobody is wrong all the time. Their ideology doesn't impact on EVERY issue. If they are betting on which NCAA team will win, they could end up being right, because it has nothing to do with communism.
 
 
LOL, OK, gotcha.

Because Communism almost inevitably leads to huge mountains of human skulls shining in the sunlight.

To put it most callously, Capitalism kills people by accident, Communism kills people on purpose.

Communism as a political system always devolves into absolutism, which is why it fails when it is a political system. Some people here at college tell me how "Soviet and Chinese Communism isn't true communism." That isn't true.

Chinese and Soviet communism are perfect examples of true communism, as those are the only types of communism that human beings are capable of implementing. Think of it. What communism stresses above all else is the redistribution of property, to ensure equality. Equality of outcome, mind you, as opposed to equality of opportunity. In order to do this, a huge government must be formed in order to take property from those who have it, and give it to those without. After that, the fallicy is that everyone will be equal, and live in a utopia without government. It will always fail because everyone is inherantly unequal. Some people are smarter, stronger, and better at doing things than others. A fundamental truth of human beings, and all things. Therefore, in order to maintain that state of equality the huge government must remain in place, persecuting those who perform to give to those who do not.

It does not take a genius to see what is wrong with this system, even in theory! Therefore, only idiots who really work to delude themselves believe that communism works in this day and age. I believe the term that Khrushchev used for people (mostly college students) in the west who believe in communism was "useful fools." A most accurate term, in my opinion.

What examples of a "successful" communist state are there? And what makes that state successful?

I'm sorry, but that is simply wrong. The United States has never deliberately killed or starved 20 million of it's citizens (Stalin's destruction of the kulaks), nor have we killed 10 million in our failed economic programs (Mao's Cultural Revolution). We don't have purges, we don't mass murder, and we don't feel the need to kill everyone who is a "counter-revolutionary." That's just how our way is more humane.

Economically, socialism is a failed concept. While a limited degree of socialism is acceptable, too much (Europe) simply results in society becoming far poorer than it would otherwise be. Don't believe me? Look at how the welfare state is failing in Europe. They recognize that they have to reduce the size of the public sector in order to improve economic performance... and the nations that are having the hardest time doing that are the ones that are struggling economically. Very easy correllation, and it's pretty direct.

Money spent on the public sector is not well spent, and therefore the private sector is far more efficient, as it punishes stupid behavior. Seperate a socialist society from a capitalist one, and 100 years later the poorest people in the capitalist one will be considered very rich in the socialist society. They may not be equal with everyone else in the capitalist society, but they will be far better off than they would be living under socialism.

And Marx called liberals "useful idiots".

Other good quotes on communism/socialism:

"Trying to achieve prosperity through taxation is like standing in a bucket and trying to lift yourself up by the handles" - Churchill

and

"Capitalism is the unequal distrubution of wealth, socialism is the equal distribution of poverty" -Think its Churchill but not sure
 
 
Yep, that's Churchill.

You are right that the USA is a good example for a working capitalism. Lets say the best and most effective. Still I think there is something like 7% of the poeple who are officially poor and a large percentage who don´t have social security. (Being the US the richest country in the world). Besides the US is rich in natural resources has alot of terrain etc. Socialism leads to a poorer society=> Europe: Like Sweden, Norway, Luxenburg, Swiss, Germany before the reunification?

Failed attemps of "democracies" and "capitalism" Well lets see: Lets begin with the old Greece. Then again the industrial revolution in the 18th century "Capitalism pur" leading to the forming of unions and first laws of worker protection. (Did you know that that the first law to protect children was passed in France bevcause the military noticed that the don´t had anny able soldiers left?)

Besides Canada and the US whereelse in Amerika is the system really working?
Communism was the other extreme or dream of capitalism. Simply put : Equal rights, equal opportunities, every member in the state working for its best of capabilties for the greater good. (_Unfortunatly IMHO human beings generally never think of the greater good but of their own good =>though capitalism works because personal "greed" works.

I although don´t believe in communism.

Still why it is in a christian country first of all that political system thought to work through compassion with the weak and equal sharing is laughed of? Think of the first christian communities. You would have to say well these have been although a bunch of idiots....? Why can´t you not even admit the the ideals are something worthwhile while the means simply don´t work with the human nature (As the believes christianity can´t work?)
 
 
theoretically both are sound, but in practise both have major flaws.

I think the rat race lifestyle created by capatilism is a crime.....one i'll never forget.
You cannot enjoy life anymore sometimes....

If i was to describe a scenario where all life is is working, months pass without you ever knowing, the whole world aims at one thing, You cannot take a moment to stop and stare, because to schedule will not allow it. Sounds pretty grim....it's life in the UK today for most people.

I'm at uni, i'm alright, i get 5 months summer break!!!
Some people will die in this circle.

Go back and read that again, doesn't it remind you of what you think communism is, working like a ******, without reason, without end?
 
 
Черт возьми, this discussion wont end well.

In terms of per capita GDP, the United States is richer than the top four economies of Western Europe (Germany, France, Britain, Italy), and that's after only 50 years of the welfare state in the aforementioned nations. Europe doesn't seem to be capable of turning things around either. How far ahead will the US be in another 50 years? Our 7% who are officially poor are there because bringing them up to the average income level would hurt everyone else a lot more in the long run. Short term detriment to long term benefit, as opposed to short term equality to long term poverty. I know which one I'd rather go with.

Old Greece's democracy ended because it was conquered by Macedon, and then the Romans. It didn't fail on it's own, it was suppressed from without. And I don't understand what you're trying to say about the 18th century. Could you be a little more clear about what your point is there?

 
Besides Canada and the US whereelse in Amerika is the system really working?
 

Where else is the system being give a chance to work, is the better question. Rampant corruption and civil war will prevent any nation from succeeding, regardless of what their ideology is.

Communism isn't about equal opportunities though. It's about equal outcomes. Communism, as concieved by Karl Marx and later through Lenin, was all about taking from the rich and giving to the poor, in order that everyone had an equal amount. That was an equality of outcome, not an equality of opportunity.

 
I although don´t believe in communism.
 

Then why are you supporting it's case?

Communism isn't about sharing, and never has been. It has been about taking. The "people" take from the rich and middle class (and if the rich fight to keep what is theirs, then they are killed), and give to themselves. That is communism. As for socialism, who are you being kind to? You are making the poor in society a little better off now... and in exchange you are making everyone else considerably worse off down the road. Which benefits more people? Which does the greater good? The answer to these questions is remarkably obvious, and everyone who does not see it needs to get their eyes examined. That is why we come down so hard on those who believe in socialism, because it is so obviously the incorrect way to go about creating prosperity for everyone.

If an individual wishes to ascribe to Christian ideals, then they can donate to charities. If they do not, then it is not the governments place to force them! We are not a "Christian" country in the official sense. The vast majority of the population may ascribe to Judeo-Christian values, but there is no national religion. The New Testament was not designed to run a country. It was designed to be a guide to how people should live their lives. If we wanted a Theocracy, we could install a Theocracy. Since we don't, we won't.

Striving to achieve ideals through a short term solution that only hurts what you are trying to do (alleviate suffering) in the long run. The ideals that those who advocate socialism have are shared by most of us, we simply are willing to understand what history and even today's world shows us about the best way to achieve them.

Also, you never responded to my question about what communist societies are successful.

Communism in the Marxian sense has never exsist(and it never will, so there's no point in arguing about it). Totalitarian Socialism has exsisted and that is what we find so fundamentally evil. It is evil because it is diametricly opposed to mans means of survival in society (rights).

I believe you mean the 19th Century. At any rate you are incredibly misinformed. Child labor has existed since the beginning of civilization; it didn't end until Capitalism was created which allowed enough capital to be raised where it was no longer profitable to use children in the workplace.

It's astounding however that you believe a teenager voluntarily working at a job with their parents permission is a greater crime then enslaving human beings in the name of "equality".

I don't know if you aware of this however, but are you aware that during the time of the greatest Capitalist period in American history the average wages (for laborers) doubled and the average price of goods were cut in half. The average GDP growth during this time period was also 6%.

Hostility: Say you were stuck on a deserted island. What do you have to do to survive? Simple, you have to build a shelter to protect yourself from the elements, you need a means to collect food, and you need clean water to drink. So now you have all this set up. Now say that more people get deserted on the same island. They institute socialist laws and say that you (being the most productive one there) have to support the rest of them because they deem themselves to be "needful". They institute a police force to enforce their laws to make sure that you don't "hord" what you created to yourself.

In one word, we hate socialism because it requires slavery.
 
 
 
Besides Canada and the US whereelse in Amerika is the system really working?
 

First of all, neither the US or Canada is purely capitalist. And to answer your question: there are lots of mixed-capitalist democracies, and these are almost always the best off economically. The greater degree of capitalism, the more prosperous they end up. Which is why even Western Europe is still better off than most of the world.
 
 
There is one successful Communist country that is making a monkey out of all.

Which is? If you are talking about China, I would remind you that the portions of their economy that are succeeding are the ones that they subjected to market forces (capitalism), and that those sectors did not begin to succeed until they were privatized. The rest remains as inefficent as ever, and largely dependant upon the capitalist sections that are functioning to keep them afloat.

I've never been so highly complimented. You sound like a very frustrated and lonely person Praxis.

What you are describing isn't socialism at all. It is easy to discredit a construction that you make yourself and call "socialism." Consider the same problem with you as the lazy one, and the people who wash ashore as the productive ones. Can you simply claim that you own the island and all of its materials, therefore they must serve to work for you? Doubtful. So we see that your construction relies only on the fact that you deem the first person to wash ashore the productive one, which is an arbitrary assignment. Socialism would be the recognition that everyone on the island work together for each other's preservation. A pregnant woman can't be expected to work as hard as a young male, but does that mean that she is entitled to only half as much food? No. Each person has value to the group.

Lol, Leave it to a socialist to create a welfare state on a desert island. Tell me, where is her mate during all this? Does he not have the responsibility to look after his family? All you have done is to teach all the women on the island that they can get out of work by becoming pregnant.
 
 
Lwarmongerer,

Just the point.

Making a monkey of all. Communism sustained by Capitalism called pragmatic communism!  

One plant, two blooms or some equally poetic explanation.

The DPRK is a totalitarian dictatorship, it's not a communist country per se.
 
 
Why is communism "a red flag"?

Maybe because anti-communism had much of Western culture frothing at the mouth for many years.

Mostly though I'd imagine it's because communism made a spectacular example of principles over people.
 
 
Principle are wonderful for the soul, but the soul requires energy........ and Communism seems to fall a trifle short, if you wish, in delivering this elixir of life!

There is one minor thing wrong with what your saying. If the first people are not the productive ones(that is to say, do not do what is required to live), THEY DIE because they have no one to loot off of.

So you see, in fact it is not arbitrary.

By the way, she isn't entitled to any food. The people who produce it give it to her because it is the correct thing to do in that situation, not because she has a right to do it.

 
No. Each person has value to the group.
 

Sounds like Division of Labor/Knowledge.
 
 
"Each person has value to the group."

Bullshiit.
 
 
 
"Each person has value to the group."

Agreed. Not everyone is useful, and some people are more expendable than others.
 
 
Not only are some people not useful, but some are downright counter-productive.

You are right if the people are so unproductive that they can't sustain themselves. But in reality, they would be motivated to work hard enough to survive.

 
Sounds like Division of Labor/Knowledge.

 

Exactly.

If I'm stranded on a desert island with just a few other people, and my best skill is making shelter and water, there is no way for me to establish a market system to trade for food. There aren't enough people to establish a market economy.

My point is that socialism is not stealing from one group of people to help another. Different implementations of "socialism" that have existed may have actually done this. Socialism is simply collective ownership and a democratic means of management. The way I would envision it is for each worker in a private company to be an equal part owner in the company, like a law firm. This is a way of integrating into a market system. Another possibility is that the government is the source of investment capital. This is the model that Singapore has chosen, and it has worked very well for them.
 
 
Just wondering how many here have seen the legacy of communism (Totalitarian Socialism really) and seen the renewal in spirit of the people recently lifted of that burden? I have a little expertise in this area, having studied the former Soviet Union, as well as having made many trips overseas to visit several of the former Republics of the Soviet Empire (Russia and Ukraine). I can tell you first hand about the decaying infrastructure (Hey, the State owns it, why should I keep it in repair), as well as the newly freed people of these countries who are inspired with an entrepreneurial spirit that dwarfs anything that can be found in a country that has grown fat and lazy from a freedom that is taken for granted. The desire to succeed and prosper is what is ruthlessly suppressed in communism/socialism, and that is why we must fight the agenda of those who would wish to impose this on us. I have seen first-hand that while it can be suppressed, it can never be eliminated. I encourage you to see it for yourself by visiting one of these countries. I guarantee you that the Eastern Europeans on the whole will treat you better and with more respect than the Socialist West Europeans ever will.

Actually all 'western industrialized' countries have aspects of socialism, even the US. Maybe the US is less so that others, but especially since FDR's "New Deal" certainly, the US is on the 'slippery slope'.

So, it's actually quite interesting - it seems as though it's a bit of a balancing act between the extremes. Going back the 'the island' for a moment, someone said that the expectant mother would get food because 'it's the right thing to do', not because it's her 'right'. But isn't the law itself simply a codification of the 'right thing to do'? Another aspect, say I'm Mr. Neutron, the most incredibly powerful human being on the planet, but I'm not too bright. Let's say you're a smart guy and you find a source of fresh water. Why shouldn't I just smash your head in and take your water smart guy?
 
 
 
Because communists are idiots.

Like you.

 

Kinda like Democracy Where the government helps you to freely **** anyone and everyone over to make a buck and socially it's a good thing as long as you pay your taxes right?
Sorry I don't have a banjo to play for you're highly educated response to this thread.
 
 
 
My point is that socialism is not stealing from one group of people to help another.

 

How silly of me to think that threatening someone with jail if they don't pay up is stealing, and that shifting the wealth is not moving wealth "from one group to help another"?

 
Different implementations of "socialism" that have existed may have actually done this. Socialism is simply collective ownership and a democratic means of management.
 

This directly contradicts your first statement. In order for their to be collective ownership, the property must first be taken (by force) and distributed amongst society or horded by the Government.

 
The way I would envision it is for each worker in a private company to be an equal part owner in the company, like a law firm.
 

Say a worker wants to negotiate a contract so he doesn't have to share in the risk of the company? What if a person again wants to negotiate a contract where they share a larger portion of the risk? What then?

 
This is a way of integrating into a market system. Another possibility is that the government is the source of investment capital. This is the model that Singapore has chosen, and it has worked very well for them.
 

Or how about you stop devising ways to steal peoples property?

This coming from a person who obviously knows little about American History. The United States is not a democracy (nor was it ever intended to be), anyone who doesn't know this is ignorant of the basic foundations of American government.

We are a Constitutional (Government is limited by a written constitution) Federal (powers divided among the states and the national government) Republic (system of three branches, based losely on the model of the Roman Republic).
 
 
 
But isn't the law itself simply a codification of the 'right thing to do'?

 

Simple answer: no. The purpose of law is to protect what is naturally required for man to exsist in a society. For example, banning people from investing from stocks the Government deams risky is not a proper purpose of the law.

Morality is a codification of the 'right thing to do'.

But law ends up codifying morality. It always has in some shape or form. Want government to ban abortions? Morality. Government sanctioned marriage (of any kind)? Morality. Even laws regarding murder, and the differences made between that and manslaughter/self-defense are simply codifying moral principles held by a majority of Americans.

Law will take on a lot of moral aspects from the dominant culture, as it should. It is, after all, meant to govern a society which must live with similar beliefs as to what is right and wrong (and penalties like prison time are there to punish people when they are wrong).
 
 
I guess this is where the distinction between "natural morals" and "societal morals" comes into play. It is arguable that some things are NATURALLY wrong, although I guess this is axiomatic and not provable. But anyways, natural wrongs should be dealt with by law, where societal wrongs should not necessarily be. Drawing the line is difficult and arguably arbitrary...so while its something that most people have a feel for, it's not something provable to a scientific certainty.
 
 
 
... The purpose of law is to protect what is naturally required for man to exsist in a society...

 

That might be the Libertarian view of the purpose of laws. However, any practical examination of the actual situation in most places in the world would indicate that laws in practice go far beyond that stated purpose. They do in fact generally incorporate a heavy dose of 'codified morality'.

Isn't forcible individual murder (i.e. killings not sanctioned by the State) always "Wrong"?

Yes, but that is an example of a natural wrong, not a systematic method of deciding what is a natural wrong and what is a social wrong.

Heh, heh, the "Red Flag" in the title of this thread is appropriate. Mere mention of the word Communism causes some people's higher brain functions to simply shut down.

You mentioned FDR's New Deal. He had first hand experience of trying to run a Command Economy during the Depression. It was called the NRA. The NRA was useful in jump-starting the stalled economic engine... and a royal pain-in-the-ass after that.

FDR had a pragmatic view of Russian Communism. He felt that the Russians would eventually grow tired of the system and move to a market economy. FDR was more concerned about Russian expansionism, which pre-dated Russian Communism.

I don't know about all that, never seen anyone's higher brain functions to shut down over the mention of communism. If you mean that people oppose it when it's brought up as a good, or even working, system, then you're right. There is a good reason for that though...
 
 
"There is a good reason for that though..."

Yeah, over 110,000 US dead and trillions of US $$$$ fighting to contain it.
 
 
"Why is the sky blue......"
 
 
Communism is a red flag because it has left behind many memories of its horrors. Communism was not essentially about espionage, or power politics, or irreligion, but a grand theoretical synthesis of totalitarianism... a theory which millions of people experienced as the practice of murder and slavery.
 
 
 
But law ends up codifying morality. It always has in some shape or form. Want government to ban abortions? Morality. Government sanctioned marriage (of any kind)? Morality. Even laws regarding murder, and the differences made between that and manslaughter/self-defense are simply codifying moral principles held by a majority of Americans.

 

Wrong, the purpose of law is to enforce our rights. Rights are an extension of morality, but they are not the same thing as morality. What the majority thinks of as morality is irrelivent to what is morality.

Morality is a code to live by, based on the choice to live. Morality for example would dictate that you don't have unprotected sex with 500 different women in a month, because eventually it would destroy you. Law however dictates no such thing and shouldn't.

 
Law will take on a lot of moral aspects from the dominant culture, as it should. It is, after all, meant to govern a society which must live with similar beliefs as to what is right and wrong (and penalties like prison time are there to punish people when they are wrong).
 

So say the dominant morality is to destroy all life, should we take it on?

NO.
 
 
 
I don't know about all that, never seen anyone's higher brain functions to shut down over the mention of communism. If you mean that people oppose it when it's brought up as a good, or even working, system, then you're right. There is a good reason for that though...

 

I think we can all recognize Communism, in any of it's historical embodiments, as having failed. First of all, it is not economically sound, since it has no incentive system, requires management by government command, has no competition, and can't get rid of failures (no "creative destruction").

Second, Communism is unstable, since all power is held by the government and whoever controls the government controls everything. Communism is simply a transition point on the way to dictatorship.

Having said that, the US had several "Red Scares" where mass hysteria has overcome all reason. Instead of a rational view on the causes of Communism, people's "higher brain functions shut down" as I said, and we get McCarthy Hearings, Sedation Acts, and other such nonsense.

The conditions that have led to communism and communist movements are easy to identify. The situation usually is: a majority of the population living in poverty (for example, Russian peasants) ruled over by a few who are fabulously wealthy (Russian Aristocrats). The only time the US came close to this condition was in the Late 19th to early 20th centuries. Hence the first "Red Scares" were in this time frame, coinciding with the Russian Revolution.

During the Cold War, a false-communism arose in the former colonies of the European empires. The Europeans were desperating trying to hang onto their empires while the local populations fought back with independence movements. The Soviets were quite happy to take advantage of the situation and help the independence movements, so long as they called themselves Communists. The US joined in the fight against these independence movements since the Soviets were backing these so-called Communists.

The tragedy is, FDR saw what was coming but died before he could implement his postwar strategy. He insisted the Europeans give up their colonies and put them under trusteeship on the path to becoming independent nations. He was particularly adamant that this be the case for Vietnam and that the French never be allowed back into this former colony after WWII.

Roosevelt also wanted China elevated to the rank of the "Top Four" nations, partly because he saw they would inevitably become a great power, and partly as an Asian competitor to the Soviets- who he felt needed containing. The problem with China was Chiang Kai Shek, whom Roosevelt came to recognise as totally incapable of ruling China. Mao respected Roosevelt and FDR was shifting towards viewing him as the better leader when FDR died.

FDR died without tutoring Truman on his post-war plans. Consequently the Europeans, led by Churchill, vainly tried to restore their empires, leaving the door open for the Soviets. The US got sucked in, Vietnam being the classic case. China was completely mishandled, resulting them in being a Soviet ally instead of a counterweight.

All long before my time. Like I said, never seen it happen.  

 
a false-communism

 

It was all really "false communism". Extreme socialism is closer, but not exactly accurate either.

BTW, the McCarthy junk was mid-20th. And the Sedition acts passed in this country have mostly been about wartime assistance of an enemy.

Correct. And your point?

 
And the Sedition acts passed in this country have mostly been about wartime assistance of an enemy.  
 

The 1918 Sedition Act was a symptom of the "Red Scare" after the Russian revolution. Under this act, immigrants of undesirable political orientation were deported, political mail was censured, and other such over-reactions.

You could have taken your red scares statement into the mid-20th century as well.

Like I said, "mostly". The bit you and I have a problem with is in bold....

16 May, 1918
The U.S. Sedition Act

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
United States, Statutes at Large, Washington, D.C., 1918, Vol. XL, pp 553 ff.
A portion of the amendment to Section 3 of the Espionage Act of June 15, 1917.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SECTION 3. Whoever, when the United States is at war, shall willfully make or convey false reports or false statements with intent to interfere with the operation or success of the military or naval forces of the United States, or to promote the success of its enemies, or shall willfully make or convey false reports, or false statements,... or incite insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, or refusal of duty, in the military or naval forces of the United States, or shall willfully obstruct... the recruiting or enlistment service of the United States, or... shall willfully utter, print, write, or publish any disloyal, profane, scurrilous, or abusive language about the form of government of the United States, or the Constitution of the United States, or the military or naval forces of the United States... or shall willfully display the flag of any foreign enemy, or shall willfully... urge, incite, or advocate any curtailment of production... or advocate, teach, defend, or suggest the doing of any of the acts or things in this section enumerated and whoever shall by word or act support or favor the cause of any country with which the United States is at war or by word or act oppose the cause of the United States therein, shall be punished by a fine of not more than $10,000 or imprisonment for not more than twenty years, or both....
 
 
 
Like I said, "mostly". The bit you and I have a problem with is in bold....

 

Yep, you nailed it.
 
 
"people's "higher brain functions shut down" as I said, and we get McCarthy Hearings, Sedation Acts, and other such nonsense."

Hindsight has shown that McCarthy was on to something, but he was definitely looking in the wrong places, and using the wrong tactics.

The real threat from the Soviets was their ability to infiltrate the US intelligence and defence community. The Russians have traditionally been top-notch in human intelligence. The fact is, they had moles deep inside the CIA, FBI, State Dept, Naval communications and defence industry to the very end of the Cold War. They probably still do.

The McCarthy hysteria aimed at writers, actors, and "Un-American activities" was negative value-added. He diverted attention from getting the moles out of the government to going after private citizens. McCarthy couldn't have done a better job of screwing things up if he were a mole himself.
 
 
Agreed.

Of course, in hindsight, there were(and are) a LOT of communist types in hollywood(we call them leftists nowadays, lol).

In some ways, yep, it is.
 
 
 
LOL, leftists suck at tossing insults. You'd have been better off sticking to the battlecry of the left, by calling me 'baby killer'.
 

Hey I am to the "left" and I would not call people "baby killers" unless they had it coming... as in they actually did such  
 
 
Peasants around the world revolting againist economic abuses....

A royal power struggle in Laos leads to a civil war...

A Cambodian king deposed finds an army to help him try and retake the throne...

Silver tongue leftists in Latin America get elected to office then desposed by the military in a coup...

A civil war between Vietnam and both sides look into history and call in allies to support them...

Ethnic issues in other nations...

Hell I almost think that Communism is an excuse for things and not the source of the actual problems....

Don't get me wrong about these "Communist" governments often being nasty but they seem more like something out of these peoples own history rather then some new force which showed up one day and changed things...

Peasands revolted before Karl Marx was born, there were royal power struggles since before the bible was written, civil wars are a fact of life, and ethnic orgin often divides people...

Of course the difference is that soldiers give up rights willingly to better the lives of others, whereas hollywood stars have the best of everything, but preach to others that we should give up some of our freedoms for their social ideals.

Fucck them.

These days, it seems everybody wants a piece of my freedoms "for their social ideals" - Hollywood will just have to stand in line.

I was hoping our "Governator" here might be a different sort of Hollywood, but he seems to be morphing into Gray Davis (last Cal Gov). Oh well, HE CAN STILL KICK YOUR GOVERNOR'S ASS!!!!

By the way, who IS your governor?
 
 
Ed Rendell.

Typical democrat whore, but very popular, and he actually does know how to create a budget surplus.

The PA state congress is sufficiently republican that he can't cram any of that leftist silliness down our throats, so i guess it's all good in the end.

Watch out for him for President or VP in the years to come. The guy is super popular among those that know him.

I'm not sure why you went off on a communist harangue in connection with what I said. I wasn't even discussing communism, but rather socialism. If you don't understand the difference, then perhaps you should do a bit more research. The US so obviously is NOT a true laissez faire capitalist society that it doesn't even seem worth debating. What do you think Social Security is after all?

No such thing as a "true" laissez faire society. Theory's do not carry over into practise just like that, just as there is no "pure" communism. However, we are far closer than most other industrialized society's to laissez faire capitalism. Hence calling us laissez faire capitalists can be correct when making comparisons with Europe, or China.

No, the US wasn't even laisse faire capitalist back in the 1800s, but it was a lot closer than it is today. Some element of "common cause" government, or socialism, would seem to be necessary in a stable society.

My only 'issue' with your post was that you quoted my comments about socialism, and thereby appeared to be 'aiming' your comments at me when they didn't really seem applicable to what I had said. Thanks for clearing up that point. In the context of the overall thread, your comments were on topic, probably more so than mine. I agree completely with your last paragraph above, regarding laissez faire, and striking a balance. Others have described the 'huge' difference between Europe and the US in this regard, and there clearly is a difference. However, both are very far from the extremes of laissez faire or a complete command economy.
 
 
There can never be a "true" communist system because you cannot have a classless society. Someone has to be in charge therefor you have at least two classes - the rulers and the ruled. By definition, having classes makes it non-communist.

I have a real problem with people calling anything that isn't pro -corporation "socialist". Communism/Socialism are not seperate ideas, they are one and the same. The words Socialism and socialist have been usurped in recent times to describe anything to do with the common good. While many of the social items on the agenda are about the common good they do not qualify as socialism.

Calling Canada and the US Capitalist is just as incorrect as calling the old Soviet Union Communist. Both governments use Fiat money (anethema to Capitalism) and economic policies (Interest rates controlling unemployment levels at NAIRU) that skew the labour market in favour of employers. Both governments are shining examples of Crony Capitalism (crapitalism) at its best.

The true marks of a Capitalist society are:

REAL money e.g. precious metals
Total lack of Banking (Banking requires and creates money substitutes)
Total lack of corporate and labour controls - let the markets decide if polluting the environment is a bad thing or not.

Popular opinion notwithstanding, Capitalism is not a classless society and has all the same classes as Fuedalism. The BIG difference is that in Fuedal society you have to be born into a class and there is no mobility between classes. In a truly capitalist society there is complete mobility between the classes. You're born working class but can become part of the ruling class or monied class based on your own abilities instead of birth.

Of course the real world intrudes so a purely capitalist society isn't really possible either. With no controls at all, too much damage can be done before consumers figure out what is happening and punish transgressions by spending their money elsewhere. Imagine un-regulated radio or television. There would be a transmitter strength arms race as thousands of competing radio stations all try to use the same frequencies and drown out the competition.

We cannot have a "true" communist, capitalist, or any other form of society simply because people are not altruistic. We don't play nice and never have.

That's false, as there would be private banks.

 
Total lack of corporate and labour controls - let the markets decide if polluting the environment is a bad thing or not.
 

Wrong again, if someone can prove that pollution is in fact depriving them of their life, liberty, or property, then the Government must step in and stop it.

If you can move from one "class" to another free from force, then the whole idea of classes becomes moot, not to mention wantonly irrational. To declare there are classes in a capitalist society is impossible, as there is no means to judge a class.

You can not judge it legally, because classes don't exsist in the law. You can not judge it by where people are in the area of economics as that changes constantly. What standard do you judge classes by, that is not completely arbitrary?

Wrong, private corporations would own the rights to given frequencies and channels.

 
We cannot have a "true" communist, capitalist, or any other form of society simply because people are not altruistic. We don't play nice and never have.
 

You need to look up the true meaning of altruism. Altruism is the destroyer. This idea leads to complete and utter self-destruction. For how can you be an altruist and eat food that "could have" gone to another person. How can you exsist morally under that system when people are hungry and you have yourself to offer up as a meal?

If your objective is to live, altruism is not the way to go.

Capitalism relies on the fact that man must do what is in his interest to survive and prosper (at least to a large degree).
 
 
How do you propose to have banking without money substitutes? How can banking possibly exist in a truly capitalist system when the very nature of banks is to inflate money supplies through money substitutes?

If you mean finance companies, those which actually loan out real assetts instead of checkbook money, then I agree those would exist.

If Capitalism is truly classless then so is communism. Communism does not use birth as a prerequisit for belonging to a class and the walls between the classes are not impermeable. If you believe in the party line and are good at politicing, you too can become part of the ruling class.

A truly capitalist society cannot have regulation. The moment you award exclusive use of a particular frequency to someone, you have precluded market participation and created a state protected monopoly. Same thing goes for patents - nobody else is allowed to compete in the market for that product therefore it is a monopoly. True capitalism is not what you are describing.

For capitalism to work in the real world it must have some socialistic aspects to it. Things that are done for the common good (polution, safety regulations, fraud protections, etc). In a true capitalist system the only control is the market. Tick everyone off and you go broke. Corporate Darwinism.

You're right about altruism, never said we all should be. Just pointing out that we're not now and never have been altruists.

Communism is a floating abstraction. I could make up any utopian scenerio, it doesn't mean that I should say that it would in actuality be classless.

Ah but abstractions are what I'm referring to. Perhaps I should have called it "pure" instead of "true".

What capitalism.org and the misus site describe are (IMHO) "real" capitalism, i.e. workable capitalism. Free markets that are not absolutely free as they are regulated to prevent self-destructive behaviors.

In practice probably true, but in theory there is no need to have a designated 'leader' class. Once the 'state' melts away (in theory) all decision making is made at the local level, by small groups where everyone can participate in the decision making. So there is no longer any need for a 'representative' system of government. To the extent that there is the need for a 'leader' at any point in time, all members of society could rotate into the position.

Communism and Socialism are not 'one and the same'. Socialism may be a means to an end for Communists whereas its an end in itself to Socialists, but they are not the same thing. Even the old USSR never claimed to have achieved 'communism', but rather only 'socialism'.

Yeah, you do. There are a lot of rights that are curtailed or taken away from you when you become a soldier. The military acquires a lot more power over you when you sign your enlistment papers than a corporation ever dreamed of.

Classes do exist in a capitalist society.

Here is the dictionary definition for social class: "A social stratum whose members share certain economic, social, or cultural characteristics."

Whether the classes are defined by law or not is irrelevent. What matters is that people make distinctions regarding other people based on their social status, family, and wealth. I know this to be true, because I come from lower class origins. My most recent girlfriend was from the upper strata of society. There are a lot of differences between the way we are used to living life. While there is a lot of mobility among the classes, that is not to say that they do not exist. A person from the lower classes who dresses approprately and is well spoken can fit in with those who are upper class, but that is simply because our class system is not as set as many (Europe and many developing countries are quite different).

In a capitalist society, differences in wealth will occur. After several generations of this, additional differences in cultural and social characteristics will also occur, between the haves, and those whose families remain as the have nots. These fulfill the necessary requirements to be considered a class system.

Or try bouncing a check, or stop paying your bills, or get fat, or have certain 'non-standard' sexual relationships.

Corporations almost never take any official notice of any of those. The military will.

The list goes on and on.

Corporations almost never take any official notice of any of those. The military will.

The list goes on and on.

 

Being ex military myself I can tell you for a fact that you do give up rights (note - GIVE UP, they are not "taken", it is voluntary). Or as my Boot Camp instructors liked to say "You are here to DEFEND democracy, not participate in it".

And I see absolutely nothing wrong with it.
 
 
"US Army" = Uncle Sam Aint Released Me Yet.  
 
 
 
You claimed those pure systems do not work because we are not all altruists. I demonstrated that, that statement is completely false, because man's very exsistence is dependent upon each man following his rational self-interests.

 

Praxus, you have made a very compelling argument in this thread, and I applaud you for that. But I have to disagree that "man's existence is dependent upon each man following his rational self-intrerests." This is a simplification that classical economics makes which is not representative of real-world behavior. Survival is dependent upon survival of a group, a diverse gene pool, not of an individual. Furthermore, altruism is a demonstratable aspect of economics. I'm not arguing that everyone is infinitely altruistic, but just that it exists to foster mutual benefit in business transactions.
 
 
Yeah, you can't apply classical economic theory to everything. Perhaps the biggest example is national defence, and then there's the environment.

And seriously man, you DO give up a lot of rights when you join the army. Whether the right to be treated politely, or the right to habeas corpus... you give up a helluva lot when you join.

Actually, I can give a couple of examples:

1) Free Speech - Just try to talk about something that is classified and see how fast you end up in the slammer.

2) Association - Join the Communist Party and see what happens

3) Medical - Try refusing an Anthrax vaccination

4) Labour standards - try forming a union or demanding overtime/statutory holidays.

As I said before, I see nothing wrong with this at all - as long as it is voluntary service. Another favorite saying of my Drill Instructors - YOU signed on the dotted line Maggot! 8)
 
 
"1) Free Speech - Just try to talk about something that is classified and see how fast you end up in the slammer."

When you gain a clearance you have to sign a form stating you'll never discuss classified info upon pain of death....  
 
 
 
Because communists are idiots.

Like you.

 

u will ****ing burn in hell mother ****er for saying this.................

long live communists and the great red flag.........  
 
 
 
agree with somebra, why are the americas so distrubuted about socialists politics? it is not the current downtroden in the usa who are a shinning example of the destruction of the poor thru capitalists? i have spent 4 years in the usa in which i see nothing but greed and materialism while the poor and mostly blacks are discriminated against. in the usa if you are not black you must be green with money. i say now capitalism raises a bigger flag of greed.

 

amen to that my man.................amen to that!

I am really curious. Why is it that you only have to call somebody a communist or socialist to discredit somebodies ideas or point of views in the states( this is at least the impression I get for example from this board)

As far as I know no communist regime ever occupied the US or ever really did it harm. Why is it exactly that you think that the very idea of communism is so bad (please don´t only look on the failed attemps as the Soviet Union or China etc. )

From a human point of view it is mucgh easier to discredit capitalism look at child workers, workers living conditions in the 18th century.... The very idea of socialsim changed the world for a better place for all of us. Why this hostility toward anything which smells of "left "thinking ?

 

Socialism didn't change child labor laws, concerned people did.

Let's see...Capitalism lets people to be free to achieve and fail...Communism oppresses the masses and their spirits. Hmm.....That's a tough one.  

Communism has to have a failed economy to thrive. In the United States the left is ever burdening the economy, ever increasing laws, ever increasing tort and legal frivolity, ever tearing away at the moral fiber, ever dividing the family, ever marginalizing our laws and constitution, ever dividing black from white, man from woman, child from adult, etc. and all so they can destroy a successful country to remake it into a Communist one.

They didn't need to do that in Russia, China, Cuba, Korea, and so on because the terrible conditions in those countries made it ripe to be taken by the communist totalitarian ideal. In America they have to divide before they conquer. That simple.

Communism promises one mans hard work and labor to pay for another man. This is why people buy this tripe, they feel they don't have to be responsible for themselves, somebody else will foot the bill. It hits at our most rudimentary weaknesses acting as mother or father. And we give away our rights as mothers and fathers. The question then arises as to who can better love our children, us or the state. Why in hell would they be better than us. The government officials are people just like us, fallible. So why would they do a better job with my money, my family, my home? Why should my money filter through their hands? Do you think the dollar you pay in tax is going to come back a dollar in benefits?

Government should be limited in scope. Protects it borders, its sovereignty, its constitution, build and maintain its roads and infrastructure and provide for hospitals and not much more than that. People should be responsible for running their families. Local charities can take care of the unfortunate with a higher level of efficiency than the government.

Once that happens in America, Bar the door Sally, the rest of the world will not have us around to fight the Blight of Communism.

It's a No Brainer and a Know Brainer.

You make a lot of statements about communism that are not backed up by communist theory. The biggest misunderstanding of communism is that communism wants everyone to be the same, and since they're not it doesn't work. That is not actually the concept behind communism. The concept behind communism is getting paid for how hard you work, rather then for how good you are at cheating people out of their money.

The facts about how communism actually works are different from the theory.
It fails everytime it is tried.  

But you'll do it better....  

Show me an actual example of successful communism.................There are none. Totalitarianism is the end result of any communist regime. Suffering, death, mishandling of public trust, and oppression. Of course if its all you know it may seem the slightest workable.      

Communism supposes the government officials are somehow better than the people at large in determining their destinies. If you believe that you are not able to be free and self governing.

You're making another common mistake. You're equating the effect of economic and political systems across nations. While in America capitalism and democracy may work best, in Russia democracy has led to a demographic crisis, general poverty, and finally a new dictatorship in the making.

These are not my words.

I'm still not understanding what you are saying to me.  

I'm supposing that you would rather America lose its idenity to a fail plan of communism?  

And that somehow because we are free that our form of government is free, (up for grabs) for any tyranical or socialist other form?  

That would be national suicide....  

Do you suppose our founders have such a self destruct mechanism built in to the constitution? If you do you are sorely mistaking Ray, Sir.

Nothing can be free in totality on this Earth here. It is ignorance to think that a nation could last long without any checks and balances. But this form of freedom is successful as long as we protect it from the self serving tyrants that seek to destroy its foundation. "Dont Tread On Me" is as much the message of the success of freedom as any, Sir.

Perhap You in India choose to be the top dog, and don't mind the demise of America and Western civilization as a whole. So you look hard for straw-man inconsistancies to move that desire along while building up your nations strengths and defences, all the while tossing out subtle nuanced comments of how American Patriots are somehow hypocritical to the original cause of freedom. I hope this is not the case though, Ray, Sir.......

In the end those kind of cheap shots would not even help to hold your dear civilization together. And as you notice I've never made these type of cheap shots at your dear civilization.

Our constitution is not written on a surrender flag, Ray, Sir. Is yours?

The concept behind communism is getting paid for how hard you work,

 

Huh  

I was under the impression that the concept behind communism was :

 
"From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!"
(Karl Marx, Critique of the Gotha Programme, 1875).
 

Whatever  
 
 
Feanor, among other reasons, the reason that communism failed is that people don't get paid anymore for working hard as opposed to just getting by.
 
 
 
Feanor, among other reasons, the reason that communism failed is that people don't get paid anymore for working hard as opposed to just getting by.

 

Indeed, if you can't earn a lot of money regardless of how hard you work, and, not less important, you can't buy a lot for money you earn, you stop working at all and just visit our workplace instead. Everyone just visits workplace, so less and less goods are available each day. Today you can buy even less than yesterday, so you stop even to visit your workplace. Then come cards for food and standing in lines.

Thanks God, those times would never return.
 
 
Why is communism "a red flag"?

Short version: hubris (fear) [herd instinct]. To understand the American bogeyman you have to remember McCarthyism and "The Red Scare". Of course, it was really a "Red, White and Blue Scare", because our ruling class has decided we are incapable of rational thought. So anything not the party line is demonized. Hell, we even have our very own Labor Day. In America, the best you can be is.... rich. Our culture does not recognize much else as worthy.

Heavens!

What a screw up I have done by trying to think I was OK in Russian.

I meant nothing of what you have mentioned in your post.

Under no circumstances am I expecting the US to give up the ship and I don't expect it either, notwithstanding the international pulls and pressures.

Yet at the same time, I assure you that our civilisation will chug along as it has been for such a long time that it is goes even beyond living memory.

And yes, Our Constitution is in black and white.

Whether India surrenders or not would depend on the govt of the day and not so much on the Constitution.

I am sorry if the Russian I wrote did not mean "You take the cake", by which I meant, you are doing a great job!

The unfortunate aspect is that I don't take cheap shots. I am quite blunt and can usually face adversarial situation without winching.
 
 
 
Afterall, communists are people (sort of), and nobody is wrong all the time.

 

You're single right?
 
 
 
And Marx called liberals "useful idiots".

Other good quotes on communism/socialism:

"Trying to achieve prosperity through taxation is like standing in a bucket and trying to lift yourself up by the handles" - Churchill

and

"Capitalism is the unequal distrubution of wealth, socialism is the equal distribution of poverty" -Think its Churchill but not sure

 

I love that man. I read a book about his younger military life and it made me like him even more.

He certainly did like an adventure.

I didn't think so.   But the quote you quoted was not my quote.

And honestly Sir, I had no Idea what you ment. And you being the smarter of us two I could only guess as to the wit of your statements.

"You take the cake" is usually used in the negative sense, and is not considered complimentary in most cases. I.E. (Ivan I've seen some losers in my day but, "you take the cake".)

So Ray, Sir, My humble and heart felt appologies to you for my misunderstanding.

Brokensickle:

take the cake
1. To be the most outrageous or disappointing.
2. To win the prize; be outstanding.

 take the cake - definition of take the cake by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia. 

You created another doubt (screwed up my Russian and was worried that I had screwed up English too!) in my mind and so I had to check the web!  
 
 
 
take the cake
1. To be the most outrageous or disappointing.
2. To win the prize; be outstanding.

 

there's no such idiom in Russian, so 'вы берете пирог' Russian can understand only literally: someone takes a thing they cook in bakery. Sounds weird, when it's supposed to mean to win the prize and not to take the cake.  
 
 
Socialism is not communism.
Communism is an offspring of socialism.

Many socialist theories and societal ideas could have worked, but were never implemented, such as the "Utopian socialism". It might have had a much better chance of success because some of these base socialist forms were not made on the backbone of dictatorship.

Communism failed because of its leaders and the way its doctrine was twisted into. The original idea had purpose, but it became overambitious, and soon sought to control and change other beleifs according to popular demand--such as the destruction of the orthodox church in soviet russia. The communist nations fell majorly into an immoral mass. Had it been created differently, and under different circumstances, it might have had a chance.
 
 
 
Had it been created differently, and under different circumstances, it might have had a chance.

 

It's my personal belief that communism cannot be successfully implemented by human beings.

Basic human nature makes communism unworkable, to the point where communism has to be held in place by the point of a gun.

Or an incredibly ruthless and savage secret police.

Extremely true. When I was 11, my school teacher in Sweden wanted to put me into psychiatry because I probably had ADHD or autism, according to her. My father gently put up the middle finger to her, later he told me that living with the stamp of "abnormal" on your forehead can and will ruin your life.

I know plenty of people who are victims of psychiatry. Their parents, instead of taking their responsibilities, take the easy way and claim their children have a "disorder". Some of them cannot live a normal life, because they believe that they are failed miscreations who cannot achieve anything.

Once in psychiatry, you cannot just get out. A female friend of mine got in due to drug problems, and now she is sometimes being told: either you increase your medication, or we lock you up. I consider it criminal, but it is "medically correct" and therefore justified.

As for the pills, we all know that pharmaceutic companies make money. I know that many of you will oppose my statement, but I say it anyway: they do prescribe unnecessary medication to unexisting disorders. They are quite easy to get (someone I know faked his ADHD to get Ritalin to concentrate), and they work like real psychoactive drugs: they alter your brain. And Rilatin, (also known as Ritalin in some countries) is deadly! It causes heart rhytm distortion on a regular basis, and children died of heart malfunction.

Once upon a time, people were "weird", "quiet" or "hyperactive". Now they are autistic, asperger patients, or have ADHD.

What is next? Will every character trait of a person become a disorder? Does this mean that the entire WAB suffers from Attention Deficit Ranting Disorder?
 
 
 
Today we have more 'experts' than at any time in history.   They feel the need to impress the hoi polloi. The pharmacutical companies love them. They appear to work in collusion for the improvement in profits and to inflate the importance of the experts. The public are largely taken in by this and wishing to do the right thing for their offspring take their children to these 'experts'. Common sense, reason and logic are not valued. Gobbledegook is. What a wonderful world we live in!   [/FONT]

Think of it as a motor car does not have a fault - but a 'feature of the design'. By and large WABbers think for themselves, and are not reluctant to speak out against idiocy (real or imagined!   )

The murderous Columbine students were using prescriptions anti-depressants way before their terrible acts and some illegal drugs as well.

I listen to an explanation by a psychologist who said that some anti-depressant prescriptions such as Artane, Haldol, and Ritalin have the effect on some patients that they feel as though they are dreaming while they are really awake and in the altered state of consciousness they act out dream like fantasies in real time, real life...Fantasies like murder, rape and suicide...And those using the drug believe they are dreaming...And since they think they are dreaming they think that is O.K. and will have no consequences. If this is true it can explain a lot of deadly bizarre behavior seen in the news that was carried out by kids and young adults.

It's a little hard to get rid of our "survival instinct" bred about over millions of years. It's hardwired into our brains. As you know, software workaround is only a temperary fix.

You know why we have this problem right now? Dicipline! We don't dicipline our kids any more. I don't mean physically beat our kids, but we do need to put our foot down once in a while. They need to know the rules. They need to know it's OK to do somethings and it's not OK to do some other things. Explain to them. If they don't get it, tough.

Kids diagnosed with ADD are probably from homes without strict dicipline. They just act out whatever is on their mind.

I was reading about the American Al Queda, Adam G...something. He's from a home without dicipline. That's why he went over to the side of radical islamism. It gave him a sense of dicipline and purpose.

The hippies are too lazy to take care of their own children at home so they turn to the government. When there's a problem, they do what they did best...put their kids on drugs.

Do you have a link to that explanation? Would love to back up things for the pro-pills crowd. I see too many parents just neglecting their job and putting their kids on the pills.

Discipline isn't the final solution. I know plenty of kids who were raised too strictly. It backfired seriously. I was raised without any discipline whatsoever. My parents told me I can do whatever I like if my actions would not harm, bother or put anyone else to danger. Quickly I learned what those actions were. I learned that doing things out of protest has no sense, because I had nothing to protest against. I've been to the police,done drugs, but quickly realized it wasn't cool and stopped with it. Today I'm a self important arrogant bastard, but a responsible and logical one. I am against giving kids rules that have no logical basis.
For example: telling your kid that he can't play with his friends because it has been too much has no logical basis. What is too much? What are those limits and why the hell should they be respected? Does anyone gets better if your kids stays home and gets bored? Hell no.
The trick is to let your kid learn responsibility from experience, not from drill.

As for ADHD and the like: it is real, but it has received too much attention in the media. Has nothing to do with discipline or the lack of it. I consider it personal traits, not disorders, traits that others simply should accept, and the holder has to control, instead of using medication.
 
 
Compassionate, sensible discipline is the answer.

Dr Spock's brats will be the answer otherwise!

But one would sure want to know how our In House Parent THL does the trick and the results thereof!
 
 
 
Do you have a link to that explanation? Would love to back up things for the pro-pills crowd. I see too many parents just neglecting their job and putting their kids on the pills.

For everyone who reads:

Never give your child Ritalin, Relatin or Concerta no matter what the psychiatrist says.

 

I heard this guy on a radio show and don't remember his name. I tried to use keywords to the subject title but could not find anything sounding like his article. Although there is much info to back up the view that these drugs are more dangerous and detrimental to children an young adults mental and physical development.

But there is big money to be made in the drug industry if people are addicted to these drugs. I believe this is a crime near equal to the illegal drug sales. Maybe even worst because it is considered "legal".

If I find that guys article I will post a thread on the subject based on his view.

Of course I don't advocate beating up kids as the first or only form of discipline. Talk nicely and explain things to kids. Most of them do get it. The problem is there are always some who just won't follow the rules unless they get a good smack. Then there are those who are simply evil and will do evil things when they grow up. Hopefully those are in the extreme minority.
 
 
gunnut,

 
You know why we have this problem right now? Dicipline! We don't dicipline our kids any more.

ah, yeah- you're from taiwan, alright.   )   ) "spare the rod, spoil the child" ain't just a saying there, it's a way of life.   )
 
 
 
I am really curious. Why is it that you only have to call somebody a communist or socialist to discredit somebodies ideas or point of views in the states( this is at least the impression I get for example from this board)

As far as I know no communist regime ever occupied the US or ever really did it harm. Why is it exactly that you think that the very idea of communism is so bad (please don´t only look on the failed attemps as the Soviet Union or China etc. )

From a human point of view it is mucgh easier to discredit capitalism look at child workers, workers living conditions in the 18th century.... The very idea of socialsim changed the world for a better place for all of us. Why this hostility toward anything which smells of "left "thinking ?

 

Communism relies on the good nature of people to get things done. When they find out that society cannot function on good will alone as motivation, they turn to a police state for order. The Soviet Union failed because Communism only can work in theory, it fails miserably in practice.

Socialism usually turns to crushing taxation for social problems. People find that both services and quality of life go down as a whole compared to a free-market society.
