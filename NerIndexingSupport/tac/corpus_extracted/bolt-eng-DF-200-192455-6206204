I didn't curse any Muslim- I'am a muslim myself. Osama Bin Laden is a disgusting terrorist and most of his victims have been Muslims themselves- if you believe in this policies you don't deserve to be called a Muslim.

Going to make takfeer of a muslim are you?

1732. Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) said: The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "When a person calls his brother (in Islam) a disbeliever, one of them will certainly deserve the title. If the addressee is so as he has asserted, the disbelief of the man is confirmed, but if it is untrue, then it will revert to him.''
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].

Sahih Muslim Book 001, Number 0116:

It is reported on the authority of Ibn 'Umar that the Apostle (may peace and blessings be upon him) observed: When a man calls his brother an unbeliever, it returns (at least) to one of them.

...And whoever accuses a believer of Kufr (disbelief), then it is as if he killed him." Sahih Bukhaari

So, go ahead if you do not value the afterlife.

I said IF you think Osama's policies are good then you aren't a Muslim because you know what if you believe that you're NOT, if you DON'T believe in what he does then fine.

The Qur’an says about the prohibition of murder, (…Take not life, which Allah hath made sacred, except by way of justice and law: thus does He command you, that ye may learn wisdom.) (Al-An`am 6: 151) and Allah says in the Qur’an, (Nor take life, which Allah has made sacred, except for just cause. And if anyone is slain wrongfully, We have given his heir authority (to demand Qisas or to forgive): but let him not exceed bounds in the matter of taking life; for he is helped (by the law)) (Al-Israa’ 17: 33). According to the Qur’an, killing any person without a just cause is as big a sin as killing the whole humanity and saving the life of one person is as good deed as saving the whole humanity. (See Al-Ma’idah 5: 32).

The killing of woman and children is HARAAM and that's what nutcases like Osamas do and therefore they and anyone who supports them IS NOT muslim.

Wow, so go around muslim communities. It looks like you have made takfeer of a sizeable proportion of them!

Once again, fear Allah and close your mouth!

You don't get it do you, lets make this simple. Do you or do you not believe that the policies of Osama Bin Laden are justified?

Osama Bin Laden and his billionaire family did good trade dealings with the elite of America. He was also a CIA agent who fought for America. Doesn't that equate Kuffardom? [Allah forgive me if I am wrong]. Also he and his Al-Qaeda cronies LIED about committing 9-11, which further perpetuate's this theory about his affliation with the CIA.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHj_qe2p3zs

If I were you I would get up and make 2 rakaats of tawba for this trash right now.

They never worked for the CIA, and so what if his family did business with America? Do you bear the burden of your family's actions also??

Well if you believe that America committed 9/11, then why did Al-qaeda's no.2 (second in rank to Osama) claim Al-Qaeda did it? They were in on this gag. Osama is a boogieman that we convieniently chase to justify the war of terror, totally fake 'Tim Osman' more like.

I didn't. He is obviously a part of the illuminati's plan to fool people towards the new world Order. No muslim lies, like he did when he claimed to do 9-11.

Has he ever said that killing muslims is ok?

Has he ever said killing non-combatants is ok?

Thing is, his opinion of a civilian is different to yours. He never said killing civilians is ok.

Bukhari Volume 004, Book 052, Hadith Number 257.

Narrated By ‘Abdullah : During some of the Ghazawat of the Prophet a woman was found killed. Allah’s Apostle disapproved the killing of women and children.

“I advise you ten things| Do not kill women or children or an aged, infirm person. Do not cut down fruit-bearing trees. Do not destroy an inhabited place. Do not slaughter sheep or camels except for food. Do not burn bees and do not scatter them. Do not steal from the booty, and do not be cowardly.”

Yahya related to me from Malik from Ibn Shihab that a son of Kab ibn Malik (Malik believed that ibn Shihab said it was Abd ar-Rahman ibn Kab) said, “The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade those who fought ibn Abi Huqayq ( jew from Madina) to kill women and children. He said that one of the men fighting had said, ‘The wife of ibn Abi Huqayq began screaming and I repeatedly raised my sword against her. Then I would remember the prohibition of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, so I would stop. Had it not been for that, we would have been rid of her.’”

Ibn `Abbas says: The Messenger of Allah, when dispatching his troops, would tell them, ”..Do not behave treacherously, nor misappropriate war-booty, nor mutilate [those whom you kill], nor kill children, nor the people in cloisters.” (Musnad Ahmad, Sunan At-Tirmidhî)
Another narration records that he said, “…Do not kill a woman, nor a child, nor an old-aged man’ (Sharh as-Sunnah Al-Baghawî)
Narrated Anas ibn Malik: The Prophet said: Go in Allah’s name, trusting in Allah, and adhering to the religion of Allah’s Apostle. Do not kill a decrepit old man, a young infant, or a child, or a woman; do not be dishonest about booty, but collect your spoils, do right and act well, for Allah loves those who do well. (Sunan Abî Dawûd)
And again, “Do not kill a child, nor a woman, nor an old man, nor obliterate a stream, nor cut a tree…” (Sunan Al-Bayhaqî)

I think it's you who needs to revise your knowledge of the deen.

Arrogant child, have you not read the statements of the Sahaba that pove that it does not appy to belligerents in these categories? Problem is, you have the incorrect belief of what a belligerent is.

Or do you need to be spoon fed.

This is like talking to a brick wall, let me summarise for you:

1) Osama bin Laden has carried out dozens of attacks resulting in the deaths of innocent men, women and children, many of them Muslims. The murder of innocents is haraam according to the Quran.

2) If you support Bin Laden, you support the killing of innocents (which is haraam), as you support a haraam thing, you are thereby not a Muslim and your support of terrorism makes you a vile human being.

3) If you do not endorse Bin Laden's policies, fine.

O brick wall!

His interpretation of innocents is different from yours, therefore he does not believe in, nor intend to, kill innocent civilians.

You takfeer of millions of muslims makes you a vile human being.

The hatred of those who are sinful kuffar, towards a person who speaks the truth no matter what is a praised thing.

Whereas, a muslim who is praised by sinful and evil kaafirs when they judge him according to their unislamic standards, is surely doing something wrong!

An example: the attack on Benazir Bhutto when she returned from exile resulted in the death of 6 month old baby boy travelling on his father's shoulders.

Your disgusting for defending Bin Laden- that kid and many others like him are innocent- unless the 6 month old baby and other like him went around killing people.

You're a vile extremist and its people like you who give Islam a bad name. How DARE you even consider defending Bin Laden. And what do you mean his "interpretation of innocent"- CHILDREN ARE ALL INNOCENT (as said in the Quran) whatever else you may believe in your twisted mind.

I am sure plenty of Muslims have added to your negative rep for your disinformation and disregard for hadiths that contradict yourself.

How simple are you?

The intention was to kill the kaafir Bhutto, the child was not the intended target. Innocents die in war; its a fact. Will you curse the muslims who used catapults on Taif and killed children unintentionally? In that case you curse the Sahaba as well!

A 12 year old supporting the kuffar physically, financially or verbally is not a civilian.

Everything else is up for interpretation, Shia's have 12 Imams who they consider to be Muhammeds (pbh) sucessor.

That's as far as I know as I ain't that strict of a Muslim but for someone to say Shia's arn't Muslims is stupid and plain right outrageous. It's you people who are out there killing people from your own country over hardly any difference (Iraq).

 

So is saying God has a son up for interpretation? Is praying to others up for interpretation?

While you can say your shahada verbally, there are some actions that negate this.

haha you are a perfect personification of the kuffar actually.

OK fine what about the World Trade Centre- sure weren't targeting combatants were they?

The attacks in a Peshawar market with no police station/army barrack or anything nearby, all killed were women and children (all Muslims).

The attack on the Marriot Hotel in Islamambad where again there were no policemen, army personnel or even politicians staying.

The Quran says you should do you best to only kill those engaged in combat with you.

The above attacks were carried out by Al Qaeda- explain to me how each and every of the above attacks os justified in Islam.

No because Christians do not believe that Muhammed was God's last prophet.

Excuse my knowledge of Islam I haven't studied it in years.

Just looking at your posts and rep I can clearly see your one of those Muslims who has been brought up to be intolerant of everything else but your own religion and even as far as the branch.         sake, kick back and relax a bit.

No?why are Shias who pray to dead people, muslims then??

or Shias who say that sunnis who do not think Ali should have been the Prophet's(sawS) successor are polytheists?

respond to the rest of my message, explain how those attacks are justified in the Quran, if you can't (and you definitely can't) then you're wrong and I'am right.

Why should I justify somebody elses actions?

Whereas by your earlier logic, the Sahaba should be cursed for the seige of Taif!!!!

At Taif innocents were killed by accident hence the Sahaba shoudn't be cursed.

Osama Bin Laden as I have clearly shown often targets places where there are no military/combatible targets and only innocent people and many of these people end up dying. Hence by the logic of the QURAN, him and those who back him are Kafirs.

No answer the question.

Bhutto was a kaafir, evil and corrupt leader who deserved what she got. The child was not the target and died unintentionally when carrying out an attack to remove an evil ruler. Does that make the attacker a kaafir?

Yet again, Bin Laden attacked a market in Peshawar- only women and children were killed. There wasn't even a police station/army barrack or anything like that nearby.

At the marriot hotel, over 100 Muslims were killed- no policemen, army personnel, politicians were in the hotel.

Tell me was the attack on the Peshawar market especially the right thing to do. Is it permissable under Shariah??

Under Shariah you must do your best not to harm innocent people, at the time thousands of innnocent people were surrounding the bus of the "Kafir" Bhutto. The attacker didn't make an attempt to ensure that the least no. of innocent people were killed, he didn't wait until the bus was alone as it soon would have been.

Benazir survived and over 20 kids under 10 years of age were killed. Therefore yes the attacker is a Kafir now answer my question- how in Islam are the blasts in Peshawar and the Marriot justified?

Again....

The intention was to kill the kaafir Bhutto, the child was not the intended target. Innocents die in war; its a fact. Will you curse the muslims who used catapults on Taif and killed children unintentionally? In that case you curse the Sahaba as well!

Thats all I need to know. If you do not think Bhutto is a kaafir, then you are a clear cut kaafir.

I am done with you, the fact that you are wrong and cannot admit it is clear, it is time for you to do some self-reflection.

 

I just answered the question about Benazir in my last post. You answer this question which you have been avoiding:

Peshawar blasts killed only innocent women and children- NO policemen, army people etc. even nearby.

At the Marriott, over 90 muslims and NO army people, policemen, politicians were in the hotel.

Is this permissable under Shariah? In your next post PLEASE just answer whether both these attacks were justified in your opinion.

Unsurprisingly you still haven't answered my questions on the Peshwar and Marriott blasts- are they justified or not? The Peshawar ones only killed women and children btw and were targeted at a market with no military/police anyhwere near.

You seem to think every attack made by those bombers in Pakistan had some religious purpose which is justified by Islam.
Well a local bus bombing nearly killed my cousin in Pakistan. On it were most of her school friends. Why were they targeted? Because Al Qaida, or some Terror Cell or America or Israel or whoever the hell it is led the bombers to believe that women should not be educated. That them going to school is somehow against our religion.

You say there are always civilian casualties in war, this is true. But when you target them specifically you go against the teachings of the Quran and against Islam. Don't try and justify them when they are so obviously in the wrong.

You would make a good propagandist, because nowhere do I, or aq justify such attacks. Fools are made to believe that those who fight for Islam would do such things, when they deny it themselves!

As would you I'm sure.

I'd fight for my religion in a just and honest way. Because I believe *their* way is wrong does not make me a fool. They are the fools. Fools for being manipulated and controlled by people much higher than them who use the guise of religion to make them commit atrocities to meet their own political and economical ends.

They aren't fighting for Islam. If they were the grace of God would be on their side, and they would be winning. They don't know what the **** they are fighting for.

Care to explain why you are calling another muslim a kaafir?

Sahih Muslim Book 001, Number 0116:

It is reported on the authority of Ibn 'Umar that the Apostle (may peace and blessings be upon him) observed: When a man calls his brother an unbeliever, it returns (at least) to one of them.

...And whoever accuses a believer of Kufr (disbelief), then it is as if he killed him." Sahih Bukhaari

so your saying him killing other innocent muslims is justifiable? does that make him a good muslim suddenly?
 
 
I didn't realise some Muslims hated each other this much. Geez. It's like stepping back into 16th century Britain with the Protestants and Catholics at each others throats. I thought we'd have all gotten over this by now.

Your stubborness and ignorance is immense. Pray to the dead? Pray for the dead, pray through the dead not pray to the dead fool. Please keep your disgustingly inaccurate claims and thoughts about Islam to yourself. And, if you think those who attack innoscent civilians like Osama are Muslim, then you are dellusional. There is a difference between one who claims he is Muslim and who one actually is Muslim, and these people CLAIM to be Muslim, therefore, they can be considered as Qafir.
Please shut up.
Thanks

He isn't a Muslim. Though I doubt someone as stupid as you will ever learn that...you probably think he's doing a good job inspiring people to kill civilians and innocent people.

Religions will fight with other religions. And then when that isn't enough they'll find differences within themselves, exploit them, and fight those who believe slightly different. Then take those slightly different beliefs and turn it into another religion and fight that religion.

Man is flawed and no matter what people say war almost always follows the word of God. Not because the word of God is necessary wrong, but because man just has a tendency to take things and         it up. People in general hold religion back.
 
 
Is this just a continuation of another thread? The first three pages seem to contain the same three people having a discussion, which I haven't really read through. Is the question just the title? In which case, surely not? I know there's such thing as 'jihad' but surely something like struggling to improve yourself and society should be a case of leading by example, and not killing... I guess everything that's done for revenge and whatnot from Islamic states is more political than religious, though, but it's all still one big mess. =/
 
 
This is by far the most pathetic thread I have come across so far. Muslims fighting among themselves. Look at the thread title and see where you have ended up: now we'r talking sunnis and shias? WTH?!

To all Muslims: Please avoid starting threads that have anything to do with Islam. While you may initiate something for a good cause, to eradicate the misconceptions surrounding Islam, promote peace amongst ourselves, this is what it turns out to be. In this case we didn't even need any arrogant Islamophobic person to ignite trouble.
Some people just choose to be provocative or simply assert their own interpretation of Islam among others. For the sake of Islam, keep it out of TSR. Those who hate Islam will continue to start threads simply to be inflammatory. Arguing there is totally different. Our lack of unity is the biggest cause of our failure time and again.

I was actually with you on this one, but Prophet Muhammad reffered to them as part of the Ummah

Signs of Judgement Day
When the last ones of the Ummah begin to curse the first ones (at-Tirmidhi)
People will claim to follow the Qur'an but will reject hadith & sunnah (Abu Dawood)

The only people who curse the sahabah are shias they really don't like Aishah and Abu-Bakr and others. So stop calling them kaffir, cos the Prophet referred to them as the 'last of the ummah'

As for the hadiths, we all know that Shias hate the Hadith/don't read it.

I was not asking anyone to ignore it. First of all there appears to have been a confusion with the thread title and turns out that they were going off topic, which is why I pointed out that it was completely irrelevant to the title "Does Islam permit terrorist attacks?"

Secondly, I asked them to keep it out of TSR because such controversial topics about Islam permitting terrorist attacks (or otherwise) being started by Muslims, is in my opinion, very stupid. It opens a window of opportunity for the Xenophobic, racist b*stards to fan the flames further by introducing their ridiculous interpretations of Islam into the thread to spread the hate further.

Thirdly, I stand by to the fact that our lack of unity is our biggest drawback. I did not at any point ask anyone to ignore it. Raising anything about Islam (although its about sunnis and shias and not Islam in general) seems to work like a magnetic field attracting the Anti-Islamic retards faster than anything else. I didn't request for myself, but for the SAKE of ISLAM to avoid such issues, when the thread starters themselves want to save Islam from being trashed by a bunch of potheads.

In my opinion, just because such threads draw in people who are anti-Islam, it does not mean that such debates should be avoided, even if it is on TSR. The last fifty or so posts on this thread demonstrate the huge differences of opinion among Muslims (from those who think that 9/11 and etc are justified and perhaps encouraged in Islam to those who disagree). This is a significant issue and it needs to be discussed.

What is more, I don't understand why you refer to those who are anti-Islam as 'xenophobic' or 'racist'. Islam is an ideology, so it is wrong to automatically label those who are critical of it as being 'xenophobic' or 'racist'. Would you describe someone who is anti-communist as a 'xenophobe' or 'racist'? I doubt it.

I don't see why such a big deal is made out of Bin Laden. Think about the so-called "troops" killing civillians in the Middle East. In my opinion they are worse than Bin Laden.

Assalamualaykum.

Before you go on a rant, maybe you should stop and consdier the fact that no muslim started this thread.

One person went around making takfeer of millions of muslims, so he was refuted, and as a result a kaafir split this discussion into a new thread. So blame them before you unjustifiably attack other muslims.

They have killed many more civilians that any so-called terrorist.

Exactly. If you're going to make a scapegoat out of Bin Laden do the same with every single solider who has killed a civilian. Both Bin Laden and the soliders have reasons for doing what they do. They are all as bad as each other. The question is who or what cause gives one man the right to take another man's life?

Islam isn't an "ideology", but a religion. It is in no sense monolithic as ideologies for the most part are. Many critics of Islam (not all) are bigots who do hide behind the wall of "political correctness gone mad", when tarnishing and maligning an entire section of the population.

I am unaware of your religion (if you follow one) and am therefore unable to respond to you accordingly. Your game with the definition of racism is an old one. Athiests have defended themselves asking whether saying capitalism is bad amounts to racism as well.I am really tired of playing that game honestly. For the pious ones, you cannot compare their religious belief with their political views/ideology.
Religion is something extremely sensitive those who follow it properly.

Just in case you did not notice, my last para was directed TO ALL MUSLIMS. I still cannot comprehend whether you are a Muslim or not. I totally agree with you, that such discussions should take place. Of course they should, but they shouldn't go off topic so easily and bring a conflict out of nothing. I posted especially for the thread starter to see because he has gone around defending Islam in other threads which were started by islamophobic people and (+) repped me for my arguments. Which is why my request was especially put forward to him. Since he dislikes Islam being humiliated (along with its followers) I advised him, for the sake of Islam, to avoid starting these topics off himself. I cannot possibly be any clearer than this. I also mentioned, arguing in other threads which have been started by 'others' is different.

The general view of those who I call 'racist' is that the cartoons of Prophet Muhammad PBUH are totally fine! Calling our Prophet a paedophile, child molester, terrorist etc is totally OK. Those racists contradict the interpretation of the overwhelming majority Muslims who condemn terrorist attacks and live sober lives and do not hold the extremist views that the misled minority do. They claim that Islam promotes such acts even though it has been clearly stated in the Quran that the killing of one human being is equivalent to the massacre of entire humanity. Even if these people don't fit your definition of racist, they clearly fit into the category of islamophobics, because they continue to promote an incorrect and violent view of Islam and refute any peaceful aspects the religion may teach. They spend hours and hours attacking Islam, trying to put it down, making it evident that if it were in their hands to decide they would make Islam disappear from the Earth. They think the burka is a ridiculous outfit. They along with the ECHR think that a ban on the burka does not violate human rights. A just legal system indeed! Inability to reveal your skin amounts to a violation of the law! I know very well who I'm calling racist and xenophobic. Those people, the minute they know you're a Muslim, stereotype you into that extremist group and CLAIM that it is not possible to be a good Muslim without making life miserable for the non-Muslims. That is XENOPHOBIA. They not only view Islam as a threat, they make strong attempts to spread this false perception. that is being xenophobic.

I can never stop them and never will even if I could. But I made it very clear that for the sake of Islam, the last thing the OP should do is start off such disputed discussions, knowing very well he would come under attack very soon. Although his intention was clearly to clear misconceptions about Islam that others possess, he will exit the forum doing quite the opposite.

The qur'an contains over 109 verses which advocate waging war and violence against non-muslims. Most are not, despite what you'll argue, rooted in historical context and are, on the contrary, open-ended and supposed to be taken as the eternal word of Allah (i.e. carry it on in the modern day).

Do you really want me to type out some verses? I'd've thought you'd know the Qur'an well enough, being a perfect muslim and all that  

Cue some         about contextual war etc.

This is precisely what I tried to say in my very first post.  
These idiots will come whenever the see an opportunity to quote the Quran out of context or perhaps purchase a tampered version of the Quran handed out by the US army, read it and make absurd claims that only his severely impaired brain can find some rationale in.

Well clearly this means you're regurgitating your previous argument which got completely destroyed. I mean, fair enough if you've got valid criticisms I have no problem with it but generic slanders with misquotes is far from a valid criticism. To answer your question, yes I do want to what verses you're referring to as I do know the Qur'an well - most likely much better than you. Oh, and well done on pre-empting your failure of an argument in your last sentence.

I haven't negged you by the way if that was directed at me.

You talk as if there is something wrong with the Quran mentioning verses on how to wage war. War is an natural part of human nature and humans will eventually be at war. It's inevitable. The Quran addresses this and sets the rules and guidelines on behaviour when conducting warfare.

I think you should read this cleanse away your misconceptions:

I don't care whether religion is extremist sensitive to those who follow it. What is important is that you cannot label those who criticise a particular religion or religions in general with the label 'racist': this is because religion has nothing to do with race.

If you insist on perverting the definiton of the term 'racist' by using it to describe people who a critical of Islam, why shoudn't I do the same? From now on, I will refer to Islam as a racist religion because it opposes homosexuality. What does homosexuality have to do with race, you might ask, yes? Not much, of course. But, since you think that you have the right to hijack the definition of race, I will too.

1 - I have a low opinion of Islam because it sanctions barbaric punishments and it is a totalitarian religion. Does that make me an 'Islamophobe'?

2 - The 'good' aspects of Islam (or any other ideology) do not erase the bad aspects.

You think a justice system that bans private sex among adults does not violate human rights, so it is a bit rich for you to complain against those who wish to ban the burka.

It is sufficiently monolithic to be put on par with other ideologies. If you take, for example, libertarianism or communism, it is not totally monolithic either. There are vast disagreements among libertarians and communists.

No, not really. A Muslim can be a libertarian or a socialist. They can be all for Reaganomics or social democracy. They can believe in absolute monarchy, dictatorship or democracy. And what is more they do. Only extremists and the "right" insist upon enforcing homogeny upon a billion + people. Two sides of the same ugly coin. Just my two cents.

Well, the online FreeDictionary defines ideology as:

1. The body of ideas reflecting the social needs and aspirations of an individual, group, class, or culture.
2. A set of doctrines or beliefs that form the basis of a political, economic, or other system.

I personally think that religion satisfies this definition. Now, I think all religions are ideologies; however, I think the term is even more fitting for Islam. This is because whereas, for example, mainstream Christianity has divorced itself from politics (e.g. the separation of church and state), mainstream Islam refuses to recognise a distinction between the private and the public (e.g. Islamic Law). Therefore, Islam is not only a religion but also a political and economic system. For this reason, even if you think that it is wrong to describe religions as 'ideologies', you should, in my opinion, at least accept that Islam, in its political form (e.g. Sharia Law/Islamic state) is an ideology.

It would be good if this diversity was more obvious. Perhaps then there would be less anti-Muslim feeling in the world.

If you look around TSR, for example, you will see that Muslims here love to refer to other Muslims as 'non-Muslims' because they hold views that they consider to be unIslamic. Just surfing a few threads I have seen some sunni Muslims refer to shia Muslims as 'non-Muslims; a handful of Muslims refer to a Muslim who condones the actions of Al-Qaeda as 'non-Muslims'; Muslims refer to Muslims who embrace the theory of evolution as 'non-Muslims' and etc etc etc. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if someone came along and referred to you as a non-Muslim (assuming that you are a Muslim, of course) because you think that one can be, for example, a libertarian Muslim. Now, if the (vocal) Muslims here are representative, then those who insist on homogeny aren't extremists but mainstream.

While some interpretations of a given religion may possess an ideology, religion itself is not an ideology anymore than being French is an ideology, which is why you can have radically different approaches to governance in two different Muslim majority states. Your base assumption is that Muslims are drawn to a monolithic system of governance, however this does not hold true when one examines every election that has taken place in the Islamic world where hardliners have been sidelined: The only exception is the recent election in Gaza.

You only need to examine the Islamist AKP in Turkey and contrast them with Iran. It's not that difficult.

If I went by TSR, most men are either incapable of asking a girl out on a date or sleeping with anything that vaguely moved while pumping iron and fantasising about their cousins. I'm from the southern United States just about everything you out line there is true for many Christians. However, it would be absurd to label one of the worlds great faiths based on the views and behaviour of a few.

Do Muslims have a particular problem with extremists? Of course we do. However that in no way justifies singling out all Muslims and Islam as some kind of monolithic ideology in a them and us scenario. Because the implications of that kind of thinking are far more dire for us all. And not in the least bit constructive.

You what what you really find? Those who know next to nothing about Islam, have no knowledge of the Shariah, coming out and talking from their own desires. They speak rubbish and pass it off as Islam in order to pacify the kuffar.

As a result somebody who knows a little has to openly refute it, and because he speaks the truth, he is mocked and called an extremist.

That is the truth of the matter!

From Abu Hurayrah (radee Allaah 'anhu) who said that Allaah's Messenger (sall-Allaahu 'alayhi wa sallam) said:

“There will come upon the people years of deceit in which the liar will be believed, the truthful disbelieved, the treacherous will be trusted and the trustworthy held to be treacherous, and the despicable (ar-Ruwaybidah) will speak out.” It was said: "Who are the despicable (ar-Ruwaybidah)?"

That is sort of a good point; however, one should also ask why so many people think they think they possess sufficient information on Islam to subscribe to this religion. For example, most Muslims I know have probably never read the Quran and many of them rarely step foot in a mosque. Yet, they refer to themselves as Muslims. Why? Why don't you tell them that they cannot refer to themselves as Muslims unless they have an advanced knowledge of Islam? (If, on the other hand, you think that one need not possess advanced knowledge of Islam to subscribe to this religion, why does someone have to be an expert to debate Islam?)

1 - I think that is a bad analogy for the following reason: 'Frenchness' is a nationality and it entails nothing. 'Muslimness', however, does entail some things. At the most basic, we know (i think?), for example, that all Muslims consider the Quran the word of god. So, that is one thing that all Muslims have in common, whereas you don't have an equivalent in the case of the French - there is nothing that unites the French apart from a passport. Therefore, while it is absolutely wrong to make generalisations about French people, it is no where near as wrong to do the same with Muslims.

2 - While there are differences in the approach to governance among Muslim-majority countries, I'm not sure if I would describe this as 'radically different approaches'. Yes, a country such as Saudi Arabia is different from Turkey but, in context, they are not that different.

I think it is important to distinguish Islam from the behaviour of its subscribers. So, for example, while there are relatively decent places in the 'Muslim world where I wouldn't mind living e.g. Turkey, that is mainly because Turkish people are largely secular and have to a certain extent removed Islam from the public sphere. In other words, Turkey is a nice place, not because the Turks practice a particularly distinct version of Islam, but because Islam has been marginalised. With Christianity and Judaism, however, the situation is a bit different. There are Christians and Jews (e.g. Reformed Jews, Anglicans and etc) who are thoughtful and reflective but they are so not because they are necessarily secular but because they take a meaingully different approach to their religious texts. This is not the case in the Muslim world where, for example, literalism is almost universal (if not universal). This is why I say that so-called moderate Muslims are actually those who don't practice their religion closely and the Osama Bin Laden's of this world are the true Muslims. If you disagree, tell me, where is the Anglican Church of the Muslim world? Yes, I know of some Muslims here and there who, for example, accept evoluton (as all intelligent people should), who are anti-death penalty and etc etc. However, they do so for personal reasons - ie they don't justify it on the basis of religion. On the other hand, the Catholic Church basis its opposition to the death penalty on religion and the embrace the theory of evolution by arguing that it is wrong to take a literal reading of Genisis.

Is that the same prophet who said that gay people are to be thrown off cliffs and those who have sex outside of marriage are to be stoned? If so, then Islam is clearly not against the killing of people.

Nearly all of their claims, that the war on terror is to establish peace in the middle east, democracy and human rights, can easily be refuted. An example would be the Iraq war, they claim they want to overhthrow a dictator and establish human rights, but he was their favourite little puppet when they armed him with weapons to kill iranians, and supported him when he was a dictator and friendly with them. Then he became an economic nationalist, and all of a sudden he's this big ugly dictator, like thats a new thing. Linking that to 9-11, the theory goes they needed a big event to bring the stereotype of Islamic terror (to many westerners who knew little of Islam) so they can pursue war in the middle east. Hardly ever is the ethnicity of those who committed 9-11 noted(egyptian, saudi arabian all friendly countries to the US, and economic assets). The whole thing is just a sham.

Islam is a complex religion, the debates put forward by people on this thread are very ignorant of Muslim jurisdiction.

Wrong.  

To answer the title, no. But Islam can be interpreted in a way which makes people think that terrorism is justified.

Shias believe that Ali was the successor of the Prophet, referred to as an Imam. There were 11 other Imams who shias regard as infallible. Therefore, shias accept the hadiths of the Imams, as well as the Prophets ones.

Anyway, this isn't as shia/sunni thread as Kolya said, so we should return to the topic.

You've missed my point, I'm not comparing every facet of "religion" with "nationality" I accept their different categories of identity (and neither are mutually exclusive), rather that arguing that their ideologies in and of themselves is a thesis that does not hold up to scrutiny: individual identity and values is composed of a myriad of different facets. Thus religion like nationality can and often do contain competing ideologies.

 
2 - While there are differences in the approach to governance among Muslim-majority countries, I'm not sure if I would describe this as 'radically different approaches'. Yes, a country such as Saudi Arabia is different from Turkey but, in context, they are not that different.
 

If your suggesting that a secular democracy is within "context" akin to an absolute monarchy we are further apart than I first thought, particularly when one considers the liberal reforms instituted by the AKP.

First off this largely secular Turkish people you speak of who have marginalised Islam, voted an Islamist party into office in several landslides. If you want moderate Islam look at Turkish Muslims. I can't give you anything that compares to Catholic or Anglican church because for most Muslims there is no institutionalised hierarchy. Believers interpret the faith for themselves (with the consultation of scholars). The lack of qualified reformer scholars has undoubtedly held us back. However we are seeing a new generation of Islamic scholars who are every bit as moderate as the Catholic Church, often more so it's trickle but these things take time. If you want a moderate Islamic sect that is by your definition "thoughtful" I would look that Isma'ili they had women leading prayers well before the Anglican Church.  http://www.theismaili.org/ .

EDIT: Overall I agree that Islam has fewer reformers than Judaism and Christianity, but this is not a situation that is anymore hopeless than it was for Christianity or Judaism: Gulf petro dollars, dictatorships and perpetual western intervention fuel literalism and extremism. Anyway, I'm going to jump off this thread, I should get ready for bed. Thank you for a stimulating discussion.
 
 
What started out as a promising thread went downhill very quickly.

Of course Islam does not permit terrorism, the meaning of Islam is peace, and most muslims disagree with the terrorist apprach and take a more pacifistic stance. Just because some fools choose to live their lives a certain way, doesn't mean that you have to be a part of it. In fact, you should show everyone the way muslims really are, and begin to eradicate the awful stereotypes that most westerners have about those who practise your religion.

Maintain a minimum level of internet etiquette, otherwise leave your reactionary bullsh*t outside. It is because of these stupid arguments I wish to avoid with bigots like you that I requested the OP to refrain from starting such discussions.

I'm assuming you either live in the UK or in Australia, so I dont see where your problem is with Islam. If you were directly affected by the system, then the situation would have been different. To my knowledge Sharia law isn't impinging upon you?

By collectively labelling a religion along with its followers as barbaric and totalitarian, you most definitely are undermining over 1.5 billion people of this planet. To adhere to your political correctness, that is a form of prejudice in terms of faith.

It is because of people like you who claim to 'not care', yet have no shame in their hypocrisy of humiliating Islam at the same time, that I made my request to the OP and all other MUSLIMS.

You spoke of a justice system that disallows adults having sex in private. I'll ask for the final time, how is that legal system affecting you? You can have sex all you want, with your male or female friends. Nobody is there to stop you. Those who are 'suffering' from such an 'unjust' legal system are Muslims in Islamic countries.
Just in case you didn't know, non-Muslims are able to get away by paying fines, as opposed to Muslims who are punished physically.
I learnt from the Saudi Arabian ambassador that there exists double standards in the enforcement of law within SA and other Muslims countries when it comes to dealing with non-Muslims. One of our fellow TSR members mentioned previously how is father was fined $1000 for having a playboy magazine and a bottle of scotch in his hotel room in Riyadh. If it were a Muslim man, I doubt if we would see him alive. Although, among the Arab sheikhs there are many who take alcohol on a regular basis.

Yet, the ban on burka affect Muslim women in their day-to-day lives, which is why I raised the issue. With your anti-Islamic attitude, I can't help but wonder why you have become so concerned and compassionate towards those living in Islamic countries, unable to have illegtimate sexual relationships. I have never in my life considered those Islamic countries to be the ideal ones as they will even defeat you in terms of hypocrisy.

Just how the good aspects are not sufficient enough to cover up the horrific sides to a system, you cannot cover up the ban on the burka by pointing to the down-sides in your view of Sharia law in Muslim countries. Also, I'm perplexed as to why you mention that the good aspects don't make the bad aspects disappear, when I succinctly pointed out that they refute the good aspects of the religion. They refuse to acknowledge or admit there are good aspects to it and when given between two sets of interpretations; one a little bad and the other more clear and just, they (and you) will choose the worst one, to fit your purpose of spreading the hate towards Islam and Muslims.

I'm not at all surprised by your ignorance and you continue to fit my description of the xenophobes.
Islam is not supposed to have a version of the Anglican Church. This is because the moment you let ordinary people enter into the system, allow them to be a mascot, they corrupt. The whole system begins to be riddled with controversy and people start to judge Islam by the actions of the Islamic-version-of-the-Anglican Church. I am glad that no such idiotic proposition has ever materialised.

Islam is clear in with its position. Prophet Muhammad PBUH was the final ambassador of Islam and that is it. The Quran is the one and only Book with the word of God for us Muslims, unlike the several versions of the Bible.

I am now reassured that you are an atheist. I don't know why you had to hide it for so long and speak in such an indirect manner, instead of just saying you're an Islamophobic person who also happens to be an athiest.

You have spoken about evolution. Basically what you're suggesting is that all Christians, Muslims and Jews who believe in the fundamentals of their religion are not 'intelligent' by you standards because they don't believe in evolution. If you were that important, you would be a member of the panel at the Nobel Committee (not that the committee has much credibility left now). No one has to answer to you for their intelligence.
Just to remind you again, Islam and Muslims are not the only ones who don't believe in evolution. There are many many scientists, who don't believe in it and religion has no nothing to do with this conclusion of theirs. Not that hard, just wiki it, click on the link on criticisms of evolution and cross check with the references provided.

Fortunately, none of us need to verify our 'intelligence' from you at any point for not believing in this man-made theory, which coincidentally made a lot of sense.

Although the scientific definition of the word theory means that it is the most superior status that can be given to a hypothesis, unlike mathematical formulae, ALL SCIENTISTS will agree that no scientific theory is based on infallible evidence. The scientists will also agree that they have to live with the fact that in the future, their theory maybe overturned. Unlike maths, which relies on logic, rather than circumstancial evidence, assumptions etc.

BTW, the death penalty still exists in sooo many non-Muslim countries and the UK only amended it by the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act-1965....only 45 years ago...thats not even one generation,despite Britain's rich history and what not. It was mainly due to the risk of individuals being falsely framed rather than to please the human rights freaks.
Why is Islam always to blame...

A 12 year old supporting the kuffar physically, financially or verbally is not a civilian.

 

What evidence do you have that children were killed unintentionally in Taif? Also, from what I know the catapults aimed all their shots at the walls of Taif to break the fortresses, not inside the city. This is quite different from bombing a market place or a restaurant when tens upon tens of innocent people who may not even know that a U.S. military commander is amongst them. To use an explosive in this case that is known will kill people in a 50 m radius to target a single man and say it is unintentional is pathetic and utterly unacceptable and is punishable by Islamic law.

The dilemma we're having is our puppet governments collaborating with U.S. military commanders killing Muslims, so you have those who want to carry justice in their own hands but they are not qualified to do so and have minimal knowledge of proper conduct in war and end up killing innocent people. Do you know, Abu Umar, that a person who intentionally kills a fellow Muslim has committed kufr? By blowing up a place knowing that it will kill 30 people, but in your intention you are actually targeting one man from amongst the 30 who is a fair target, doesn't making it unintentional at all because you know for a fact it will kill them. And the whole argument of a 12 year old supporting a kafir, first of all he is a 12 year old so he most surely doesn't understand the intricate details of why she, according to you, is a kaafir.

Unfortunately, some idiots and ignorant fanatics in the deen have used body counts as a valid argument: Since this military commander will kill hundreds if we don't stop him, it's ok to kill him at the expense of 20 people because the net is avoiding killing hundreds of people. This has no basis in Islam. In fact, Islam advocates for the exact opposite:
"whoever kills a soul, unless it be for manslaughter or for mischief/corruption in the land, it is as though he killed all mankind"
(Qur'an 57:32)

This contradicts this lunatic body counting principle, just the same principle that the U.S. used to justify the murderous, barbaric hiroshima and nagazaki bombs. One innocent soul killed is one too many.

Isn't that a bit too extreme? I mean, a person never heard of or experienced an act of kufr committed by Bhutto, so he/she does not consider her kaafir. What's wrong with that?

You have been quite strict at him for being loose with takfir, then why are you doing the same yourself?

EDIT: This line of reasoning is very, very dangerous as to be certain that Benazir Bhutto's blood is not haram. You need to prove to me quite clearly that she spread corruption in the land to deserve her death. Also, keep in mind even if that is the case she should go through a trial and get the punishment she receives by law, not by fanatics who have absolutely no authority in the religion and do not have the qualifications to practice qadaa` (jury)

You don't have problem in making takfeer of Muslims who differ in beliefs to you.
