 http://rt.com/usa/news/monsanto-sue-gmo-vermont-478/ 

If they should lose, they could no longer label their productions as "all natural".
 
 
Monsanto is one of the actually evil corporations out there. Not because their products are genetically modified, I understand why it is done and I don't think that making a product that gets more food per acre is inherently bad. My problem is with how they go about it as a business.

If you grow a Monsanto product you cannot carry over the seeds grown on your property to the next crop. That alone is pretty bad but if the farmer agrees to it (and they must when they buy the seed) then they knew what they were getting into from the start but then they go after people who's non-Monsanto crop was "Polluted" by Monsanto products grown in a completely different field. You can't stop the birds and the bees from pollinating or the wind from blowing pollen over a property line that is separated by a dirt road.

Farming as a business runs on a pretty thin margin and Monsanto knows that quite well. They pile on lawsuit after lawsuit with the goal of burying the farmer who was "polluted" by their products in financially unbearable bills and driving them out of business. I think that Monsanto doesn't want the label that this law would mandate being put on their products because a lot of people wouldn't knowingly buy their products strictly because of their business practices. I know that I wouldn't if I knew what it was and I had a choice.
 
 
Well, these people with polluted crops should demand Monsanto replace their seed with normal, non-modified seed they would otherwise have used.

Of course, from Monsanto's point of view, these other farmers are probably playing a game of chicken, wanting and happy to be using it, nudge-nudge, wink-wink, then feigning they dis liked the pollution when caught.

I'd be careful about buying into the narrative that these other farmers are just innocent, stepped-on bystanders. Some probably are. Most might be frauds.
 
 
If it were cases of entire fields of Monsanto plants being grown then you would have a point but that's not the case. Farmers who end up with a small percentage of a several acre crop (randomly spread over that entire acreage) that has been naturally cross pollinated get sued like they are intentionally growing an entire field of their product by planting their GM seed. It's a racket intended to force all of the farmers in an area to buy their product (once one local farm starts using it which places them at risk of cross breeding by the expected natural means) or risk a lawsuit that can literally cost them the farm.

Monsanto carefully monitors the amount of seed that they sell per acre planted (they don't sell extra) and part of the deal when you buy it is that you have to mark the field in regard to what strain it is using their signage and that they can test it to make sure it is what you say it is so the idea that some farmers are somehow acquiring and then using the seed "On the sly" as it were is highly unlikely.
 
 
Some framer ought to counter sue Monsanto for polluting HIS crop with THEIR pollen.

^^^^ This.

I really don't understand why people flock to anti-GMO woo when there are perfectly legitimate reasons to hate Monsanto.
 
 
What the...!?!?

I just became a resident so I could register my truck.

No.

Percy Schmeiser knew exactly what he was doing.
 
 
Monsanto threatens to sue entire state of Vermont

As if bringing suit against state governments doesn't happen all the time.

Remember when Prop 8 was taken to court? How dare those gays sue the entire state of California ? The nerve of some people!
 
 
 
If you grow a Monsanto product you cannot carry over the seeds grown on your property to the next crop.

 
So what? And what farmers actually do that outside of 3rd-world subsistence farmers?

Absolute nonsense, no such thing ever happened. And this is about the 10,000th Monsanto thread here, so don't think you're the first to parrot this nonsense you read on an anti-Monsanto site.
 
 
 
Farmers who end up with a small percentage of a several acre crop (randomly spread over that entire acreage) that has been naturally cross pollinated get sued like they are intentionally growing an entire field of their product by planting their GM seed.

 
And the evidence this has happened is... ?

Cite some court cases to support you assertions. Every court case I have seen (and I have looked at a few) has shown Monsanto only going after farmers that knowingly infringed on their product. Monsanto will pay to clean up any crosspollinated plants that grew on a farm as well.
 
 
 
So what? And what farmers actually do that outside of 3rd-world subsistence farmers?

 
Without commenting on the whole Monsanto business, plenty of farmers hold back seed for replanting. As long as the seed is not from a F1 hybrid and there were no disease issues, why wouldn't you? One small example :

"74-year-old Mo Parr [of Indiana] is a seed cleaner; he is hired by farmers to separate debris from the seed to be replanted. Monsanto sued him claiming he was "aiding and abetting" farmers, helping them to violate the patent. "  source

Monsanto got a permanent injunction against Parr. Read it yourself, there are lot's of goodies:

"Fred and Jim Inskeep testified that they were convinced by Parr that it was
permissible to save Roundup Ready soybeans and replant them on their farm."

Read my post again, it isn't very long  . I wasn't denying what you say, just commenting that seed retention is common and far from being a "third world subsistence farmers" practice.

Read the injunction, it seems likely that most of Parr's customers were using monsanto seed to replant. Your one small example doesn't support your claim.

 It's happening , sort of  
 
 
 
Read the injunction, it seems likely that most of Parr's customers were using monsanto seed to replant. Your one small example doesn't support your claim.

 
I have read the injunction. My claim is that seed retention for subsequent sowing is a common practice in First World agriculture. And so it is. Meanwhile, Parr is allowed to go on with his business. From the Monsanto website:

"Mr. Parr is able to continue to clean conventional soybeans, wheat and other non-patented seed crops"
 
 
 
 It's happening , sort of  

 
Case was dismissed, but we get to look forward to the appeal.

So the state of VT plans on labeling all food. What will that accomplish?

 
It will warnb people who do not wish to encourage Monsanto's parasitic business practices that this might be one of their proiducts and warn those who do not want to risk there being an allergen in the product that they are about to eat frankenfood.

Until that crap is PROVEN to be safe, people have a right to know about it.

You are grossly misinformed about Monsanto's business practices and the safety of GMO foods.

You do realise that just about every single foodstuff in the world is genetically modified, don't you? Just because it was done over millennia by farmers rather than by scientists in lab coats doesn't make it any less of a modification.

So? Some of them produce chemicals that are toxic to some people. When you start splicing genes to produce proteins that have not previously been present in the food supply, you run the risk that some people will not tolerate them well.

Bear in mind that some frankencrops are designed to be toxic to insects. Frankencorn is supposed to be toxic to the caterpiller that invades growing ears of corn. Is the toxin in the pollen? What will that do to butterflies and other major pollinators?

Then there is the problem that some of their frankenseeds have a self-extinguishing gene. Bad news if that gets into the natural crops.

 http://www.fr.com/files/uploads/publ...pr_22_2008.pdf 

 
 After 2014 , farmers will be able to reuse Roundup Ready soybeans and not worry about getting sued.

The cool thing about patents is that they only last for 20 years, after which everyone can use the invention for free. All these improved crops Monsanto is inventing will be public goods before too long. They'll have to come up with something much better if farmers are going to continue paying a premium for it.

Wouldn't a self-extinguishing gene, uh, self-extinguish? I don't see how it could spread very far if it self-extinguishes. That's the law of natural selection. Things that are better at reproducing continue. Those that aren't go extinct.
 
 
 
Monsanto threatens to sue entire state of Vermont

As if bringing suit against state governments doesn't happen all the time.

Remember when Prop 8 was taken to court? How dare those gays sue the entire state of California ? The nerve of some people!

 
It would be unprecedented! Like the Supreme Court overturning a law!

You only get half your genes from either parent. The dominant gene usually wins in the battle to shape the offspring.

If, for example, you have one allele for hemophilia, and your spouse has none, your child is safe. If one of them marries into a family that has a history of hemophilia, his or her offspring are at risk.

Over a couple growing seasons, enough pollen with the lethal gene may fertilize enough normal crops that you have a preponderrance of dead-end seeds when the two alleles meet.
 
 
 
You do realise that just about every single foodstuff in the world is genetically modified, don't you? Just because it was done over millennia by farmers rather than by scientists in lab coats doesn't make it any less of a modification.

 
This is true for a certain definition of "genetically modified". But I'd suggest that selective breeding is a different matter from splicing in genes from entirely different organisms.

Bit of a bummer, though, when a proportion of your legitimately retained,supposedly non-GM seeds, fail to germinate because they contain a suicide gene blown in on the wind. Anyway, such techniques aren't used for that very obvious reason.

What allergen(s) would that be? A made up one?

 
Until that crap is PROVEN to be safe, people have a right to know about it.

 
Great, so we agree. People already know about it and it has already been proven safe. Woo-woos will disagree, but who cares.

A friend at Monsanto gave me a heads up on what one of the next things are.  
 
 
 
This is true for a certain definition of "genetically modified". But I'd suggest that selective breeding is a different matter from splicing in genes from entirely different organisms.

 
The nutwads always assume this makes the product "unsafe". As skeptics, we know it's equally likely that it makes it safer. Or is neutral.

Of course, it "needs more testing". Funny, no matter how much testing is done, to them it's never enough.
 
 
I suppose I should ask my brother about this... a Vermont attorney who has in the past (I don't know about currently) represented Monsanto's interests to the Vermont legislature, since he is friends with many of the legislators including the Speaker of the Vermont House. When I go up for a visit, I tend to not talk politics with him really, since I'm more moderate than he is, and I really don't like that he's a Life Member of the NRA (I'm a gun owner, but I've never liked their tactics).
 
 
 
Evidence? (Note: "Organic Farmer Magazine" and "Natural News" are not scientific sources)

 
that any of them can be made to produce a substance which is toxic to enemies or their own offspring is kind of a big red danger flag and reason enough to demand proof of safety.

Arsenic was supposed to protect us all from starvation, back in the day.

Yeah. Monocultures crash badly when things go wrong.
 
 
 
Yeah. Monocultures crash badly when things go wrong.

 
How do you know seedless oranges aren't killing you and your offspring?

Or seedless grapes and watermelon for that matter?

And tangelos, what the hell kind of diabolical genetic defect produced those abominations?  
 
 
[quote=WildCat;8188121]How do you know seedless oranges aren't killing you and your offspring?Seedless oranges are all clones, grafted onto other trees. I a blight hit, it could be devastating. Clones are more subject to blgiht than naturally bred organisms.

California vineyards had to do a lot of replanting when a new variety of plant lice invaded and their rootstocks could not resist the new invader.

If you think monocultures are such a great idea, I would ask that you confine yourself to eating Lumper potatoes exclusively, then get back to me on how good an idea it is.

What the hell does this thread have to do with monoculture?

I take it everyone has conceded that the claim that Monsanto sues people for having pollen blown on their fields are utter nonsense?

And were the plant lice genetically engineered or something?

What the hell does this thread have to do with monoculture?

 
Monsanto wants everybody buying their seed. That can get out of hand.

 
I take it everyone has conceded that the claim that Monsanto sues people for having pollen blown on their fields are utter nonsense?

 
I need to do a little more research on that, but you are still stuck with the fact that they cannot keep the pollen confined to their customer's farms. This can lead to some serious problems, depending on how dominant or recessive the genes of their seeds are.

 
And were the plant lice genetically engineered or something?  

 
No. I bring that up to show some of the dangers inherent in monoculture. They were perfectly adapted to overcome any resistance that the particular rootstock that the growers were using might offer. Disaster follows.

So? I'm sure all seed manufacturers want everybody to buy their seed.

Ah, so you have no evidence for your claims.  

 
No. I bring that up to show some of the dangers inherent in monoculture. They were perfectly adapted to overcome any resistance that the particular rootstock that the growers were using might offer. Disaster follows.

 
This thread isn't about monoculture. And even natural, non-agriculture flora is also vulnerable to such things, see Dutch Elm Disease for example. Or do you think Monsanto is responsible for that too?
 
 
 
Monsanto wants everybody buying their seed. That can get out of hand.

 
Wait....so a business wants everyone to buy their product? Stop the presses!!!  
 
 
 
Ireland, 1845 - 1852.

 
Cool. So we have nothing to worry about in the US.
 
 
 
Wait....so a business wants everyone to buy their product? Stop the presses!!!  

 
The Horror!
 
 
I was under the impression that a high percentage of the world corn is a single species of monsanto gmo. Generic diversity is important for survival.

If i'm mistaken I apologize as I don't have time to fact check at the moment.
 
 
 
Monsanto wants everybody buying their seed. That can get out of hand.

 
Hybrid seeds are not monoculture.

That applies to any plant breeder, except unlike conventional breeders, monsanto has to get FDA approval.
 
 
 
This thread isn't about monoculture.

 
To some extent, it is. That would be the natural result if Monsanto's suicide genes pollute the natural seed stock. It could result in the serious decline or even ellimination of natural seed stocks, leaving us with only Monsanto's crap.

 
And even natural, non-agriculture flora is also vulnerable to such things, see Dutch Elm Disease for example. Or do you think Monsanto is responsible for that too?

 
Where did the elms damaged by Dutch elm disease originate?

Again, we have an effect of monoculture. Vast stands of forest were cut down in building cities and heating homes and replaced with a single species of fast-growing trees. Now we have the same situation that led to the lumper disaster.
 
 
 
Cool. So we have nothing to worry about in the US.

 
This, of course, assumes that no organism will evolve that thrives on Monsanto corn.
 
 
 
To some extent, it is. That would be the natural result if Monsanto's suicide genes pollute the natural seed stock.

 
So Monsanto's "suicide genes" could turn corn into soybeans?

 
It could result in the serious decline or even ellimination of natural seed stocks, leaving us with only Monsanto's crap.

 
Farmer's kind of like Monsanto's "crap". Otherwise they would buy something else. Funny, that.
 
 
 
So Monsanto's "suicide genes" could turn corn into soybeans?

 
No. It could make anything other than their breeding stock extinct. (They do suicide soybeans, too.)

 
Farmer's kind of like Monsanto's "crap". Otherwise they would buy something else. Funny, that.

 
They need to wake up and learn from the lumper disaster.
 
 
 
No. It could make anything other than their breeding stock extinct. (They do suicide soybeans, too.)

 
Is that the brand name?

 
They need to wake up and learn from the lumper disaster.

 
I'll let them know of your concern.
 
 
 
No. It could make anything other than their breeding stock extinct. (They do suicide soybeans, too.)

 
I am confused. As Monsanto vowed that they would not commercialize genetic use restriction technology back in 1999...how exactly are they doing suicide corn and soybeans?
 
 
 
So Monsanto's "suicide genes" could turn corn into soybeans?

 
Wow. An argument directly out of the creationist playbook. Whodo thunk it would be Scrut who would pull such a boner.
 
 
 
I was under the impression that a high percentage of the world corn is a single species of monsanto gmo.

 
This seems unlikely. GMO corn is only used in about 10 countries. Even then while Monsanto makes up a decent percentage of that GMO corn, it not as high as most people think. What Monsanto has done is made many of their patented genes available to competitors at a cheap price. So some of their genes appear in both a high percentage of their own products as well as their competitors. When you read anti-gmo reports about Monsanto controlling __% of the (corn/soybeans etc) GMOs they are generally including all of the competitors products if they have so much as a single Monsanto gene.
 
 
 
I am confused. As Monsanto vowed that they would not commercialize genetic use restriction technology back in 1999...

 
I'd think that what they have done in the last decade or so would be far more important than some unenforceable promise long ago.

Welcome to the forum, Wayward son.

Welcome to the forum, Wayward son.

 
Thanks - I have been a member for a couple years...but never post. Absolutely what Monsanto has done in the last decade would be far more important than an old promise. And therefore I look forward to examples of Monsanto commercializing suicide/terminator/GURT technology.
 
 
 
Ah, so you have no evidence for your claims.  

 
I've heard it before. One of my friends, an angry commie pinko hippy environmental engineer, was talking about it. It's a bad idea to allow cross-breeding. Monsanto is acting like total douche-nozzles, but preventing cross-breeding is still important.
 
 
 
And therefore I look forward to examples of Monsanto commercializing suicide/terminator/GURT technology.

 
I find it very disturbing that Monsanto is pressuring the government of Mexico to allow widespread planting of their suicide corn in places like Sinaloa, where so much of the native gene pool of corn varieties is located. These crops, perfectly adapted to less-than-idea soil, are too precious to risk their extinction.
 
 
 
You do realise that just about every single foodstuff in the world is genetically modified, don't you? Just because it was done over millennia by farmers rather than by scientists in lab coats doesn't make it any less of a modification.

 
I see this said all the time. I disagree. There are many things that can be done in the lab that never could have been done with regular farming or animal breeding.

(You realize this is a skeptics forum, right?)
 
 
 
Suicide genes exist.

 
First of all, it is really nice to see someone outside of infowars using a multiple conspiracy nut like William Engdahl as a source.

Second, whether or not suicide genes exist, you are claiming that they are being used. You are claiming that they are being used in specific locations. They are not. And, Monsanto did not buy DPLS for 1.6 billion for their research into suicide genes as Engdahl claims. They bought DPLS for 1.6 billion because it was by far the largest cotton seed company. Monsanto said in 1999 that they would not commercialize such technology. There is no evidence to support them going back on their word on this. You may dislike Monsanto. I may dislike Monsanto. But there is something called evidence which is supposed to trump personal feelings on a skeptical forum.

 
Got proof they are not in corn?

 
Really? Claims that someone else must prove a negative are being used on this site? Sad.
 
 
 
 

(You realize this is a skeptics forum, right?)

 
Did you read the link?
 
 
 
I see this said all the time. I disagree. There are many things that can be done in the lab that never could have been done with regular farming or animal breeding.

 
Then you will have to talk in terms of specific modifications rather than the technology used to make them. Most critics of GMOs avoid specifics because they don't know any.
 
 
 
Did you read the link?

 
I already commented about the the reliability of Engdahl, but to add from the link:

"The original developers of terminator technology, Delta & Pine Land Seed, which Monsanto bought in 1998" No they didn't. Monsanto bought DPLS in 2006.

"In February 2003, at a meeting of the International Seed Federation in Lyon, France, Monsanto released a paper titled, "The Benefits of GURTs.""

That is not a Monsanto paper - and it is probably the reason why Engdahl lied about the take over date of DPLS.

Thankfully I didn't read all of Engdahl's piece, but the stuff about Percy Schmeiser is laughably dead wrong, which anyone can see by reading the court transcripts.
 
 
 
Did you read the link?

 
No, because I'm a skeptic who values critical thinking.

As I said above, Percy Schmeiser knew exactly what he was doing. Which is why he lost. Which I learned from reading the transcripts.

You are probably the only other person I have heard of who has read them as well. That is sad, especially as the Supreme Court went out of their way to explain that if the claims Percy Schmeiser made (and continues to make) outside of the courtroom were true he would have won easily. His claims inside the court did not match his claims outside the courtroom. Presumably because he, and his lawyers, understood how easily those claims would have shredded to pieces by the evidence.

It will warnb people who do not wish to encourage Monsanto's parasitic business practices that this might be one of their proiducts and warn those who do not want to risk there being an allergen in the product that they are about to eat frankenfood.

Until that crap is PROVEN to be safe, people have a right to know about it.

 
Right to know about it, sure. From your words it seems like you actually want people to get on bended knee to the power hungy for approval for everything.

I'm willing for a test that this prior restraint costs more lives than it saves, by delaying or forbidding good stuff than by banning bad things that might get to market too quickly.

We know that nobody is going to die if an evil cabal of corporate swine do not get control of the seed stock.

There exists the possibility that some natural seed stocks will go extinct if they do.

Thus, the burden of proof that their unnatural **** is safe is on the corporate swine. They have no right to gamble with other people's lives and fortunes.
 
 
 
That's not how it works.

This is a testable claim, isn't it?

If it turns out that the "organic farming journal" post is wrong, and Monsanto's blog is correct, this would be evidence that your procedure for trusting one over the other is inaccurate, wouldn't it?

If that turns out to be the case, would you be willing to admit to your error in trusting biased news sources over Monsanto's public statements?
 
 
 
This is a testable claim, isn't it?

 
Sure, but you have a well-financed corporate lie machine slapping down anybody who requires that they do the testing.

There is no reason to trust data collected in any way that Monsanto can influence.
 
 
To clarify, here's what the OP article says is true about Monsanto:

 
With Vermont legislators now standing in the way of what could mean even more money for Monsanto, the company says they will sue the state if H-722 is approved. Now in fear of a lawsuit in the future, lawmakers in Vermont have put a hold on any future voting regarding the bill.

 
And here is what Monsanto says is true:

 
We have not testified on the bill in question, nor have we made any public statements.
A legislative committee held hearings about the labeling effort and invited a number of groups to provide their input. A representative from BIO, the industry trade group, did testify before the committee, and did say that the bill raised constitutional questions that would need legal review. But there was no threat to sue.
Additionally, the House Agriculture Committee heard similar information regarding constitutional questions from the Vermont Attorney General’s office and the Vermont Legislative Council.

 
It should be easy enough to figure out whether the former was true. What was the article's source? Where can we find a statement from Monsanto about suing? What legislators have referred to Monsanto's threats or commented on Monsanto as part of putting the bill on hold? Where is order/act of Vermont that "put a hold on any future voting regarding the bill"?

The latter is also testable. Who testified and who didn't? What did they say? It's all a matter of public record, isn't it?

It will be interesting to see whose statements turn out to be confirmed, and whose turn out to be baseless conjecture.
 
 
 
Sure, but you have a well-financed corporate lie machine slapping down anybody who requires that they do the testing.

 
Sorry, you're misunderstanding what I asked. I mean the truth of the OP article, versus the truth of Monsanto's blog, is testable because the records of the legislature's reasons and behavior are public. So we should be able to find out very easily whether the OP "news" source or Monsanto is misrepresenting the facts about what's happening in Vermont.

I'll ask again -- if the facts show Monsanto to be accurate and the organic farmers to be rumor-mongering, will you cop to that and change your opinion about what sources to rely on in the future?
 
 
 
I have good reason to think that anything the Monsanto swine post is BS, compared to an articlein an organic farming journal.

 
An organic farming journal would cover all farms. I know of no farmers growing sand or steel.
 
 
 
And, (I shouldn't have to repeat this on a Skeptics forum), but....."Organic Farmer Magazine" and "Natural News" are not scientific sources

 
I think they should be accepted at face value in this thread, given that it started with a link to RT.com.
 
 
 
 Linkified . Thanks.

 
Kind of mucks up the thread premise.

As for the evil causes of loss of crop biodiversity, it's as much about the motive as it is the corporations behind it. We need the '  Green Revolution  ' as much as we need to be careful how we go about it.

 HOW HAS THE GREEN REVOLUTION AFFECTED CROP DIVERSITY? 
 
The green revolution has resulted in farmers planting fewer varieties of the crops that they grow so that they can focus on use of high yielding varieties. In addition, the varieties that are planted have been bred to a high degree of genetic uniformity within each variety. Both of these approaches are a change from past practices, in which farmers planted a large number of different, often locally-adapted, varieties, each of which generally contained a large number of different genotypes.

Thus the green revolution results in losses of genetic diversity over both the short and the long term. (Here I'm using "genetic diversity" simply to refer to the number of different genotypes in a variety or area.)

For example, in India farmers have planted 30,000 different varieties of rice over the past 50 years, with the varieties grown in a region closely matched to its soils, climate and so forth. With the advent of green revolution varieties, this has changed. It is estimated that 75% of all rice fields in India were planted to just 10 varieties in 2005!

Similar trends are found in most regions of the world in which the green revolution has been adopted.

 

Dismissing the problem of loss of crop biodiversity and ignoring the history of such a major starvation events as occurred in Ireland is an example of the kind of ignorance the right wing cheerleaders so often display in the JREF forum. Anxious to criticize lefty, the facts are conflated with his other claims addressing him but not what he posted.
 
In the early 1970's, a new corn genotype (new type of cytoplasm actually) was released in the US; the "Texas male sterile" (TMS). Hybrids that contained this new characteristic had many desirable properties, and growers were excited about them, planting them over miles and miles of corn acreage in US. They were, of course, bred to be resistant to the most common corn diseases. However, they were not resistant to a previously unimportant strain of a fungal disease; the southern corn leaf blight (caused by the fungus Helminthosporium maydis). Ninety percent of the corn sowed in the US in 1970 contained the TMS trait and also shared genetic susceptibility to this pathogen. The fungus encountered all this acreage of susceptible host and wiped out one fourth of the US corn crop in 1970, a loss of over one billion dollars in production! If the corn acreage hadn't been such a monoculture, the fungus wouldn't have been able to spread as rapidly, as it would have encountered barriers of genetically resistant plants.

 
The problems with loss of crop biodiversity is something from biology 101.

Quite frankly, any state government is, by definition, and by special position of creating laws, one of the biggest of the big boys, and everyone else, including corporations, reserves the right to sue the holy hell out of them.

I love the idea of governments living in fear of the people, kthxbie.

Corpoprations should not be allowed to file suit until they are able to prove harm. I do not see where Monsanto has any case.

I fear corporations that do not fear punishment for their misdeeds. They aren't people ande they are not bound by any of the moral constraints that keep us from whacking people who disagree with us.

We need a corporate death penalty to put them back in their places.

While I disagree with a lot of what you've said here, in the case of Schmeiser 4 of the 9 judges agreed with that sentiment, pointing out that Schmeiser had gained nothing, whether or not his acts were deliberate or accidental. The 4 dissenters argued that the patent applied to the original seeds, not their descendants.

This makes sense to me, as otherwise the onus falls on the innocent victim of accidental GM pollination to clear up a mess not of their own making.

Except the that majority in that case specifically did not rule on accidental contamination, so they did not put any onus on a victim of contamination. There is also the fact that monsanto has paid to clean up accidental contamination from the farm in question.
 
 
 
You are probably the only other person I have heard of who has read them as well.

Judges tend not to like it when you knowingly tell lies in their courtroom under oath. They can send you to prison for it.

But you can lie all you like to the press or some conspiracy nutter/communist blogger, they'll believe whatever you say and then you get people starting threads about the lies.

Over and over and over again...

Since I have an online subscription to the local daily for that part of Vermont, the Barre-Montpelier Times-Argus, I looked around for an article of some kind and found a 'legislative round up' type of article from April 10th, that gives short blurbs on each bit of major legislation they're working on up in Montpelier (they only have 3 weeks left in the session for this year). This is what they have for this proposed legislation:

 
GMO labels

The House Agriculture Committee will hold a public hearing Thursday on a bill that would require food containing genetically modified organisms to be labeled as such.

Many people fear the health effects of genetically altered food, thus, the effort to let consumers know whether those ingredients are found in their food.

The House Agriculture Committee has spent time working on the GMO legislation this year and continues to do so, making Vermont one of about 20 states where similar measures are pending.

But the labeling mandate is unlikely to become law this year, the chairwoman of the House Agriculture Committee, Rep. Carolyn Partridge, has said. There are concerns Vermont would become embroiled in an expensive court case if it passed the law.

The GMO bill is expected to pass out of the agriculture committee and stall in the House Judiciary Committee. The public hearing on the bill Thursday, April 12 from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. in Room 11 at the Statehouse.

 
 http://www.leg.state.vt.us  is the place to go to research the bill directly, if anyone wants to do that.

Well, people are saying Monsanto will replace your seed if you are a nearby farm and are contaminated.

Others are saying most farmers don't save seed themselves anyway (I have no idea if this is true, but a modern business model might find it easier or cheaper to just sell it all and buy new next season. Of course somebody has to farm seeds, then, too.) This suggests farmers are suddenly "preserving their own seed", knowing it is probably contaminated, letting them take advantage of the Roundup Ready or whatever it is, without having to pay for it.

For every honest horror story, how many are scam farmers? A handful? 50/50? 99%? Amanda Knox did it, I'm sure! No you're not! Yes I am!
 
 
 
There is no reason to trust data collected in any way that Monsanto can influence.

 
Then trust court documents, scientific publications, and respected institutions like the national academy of sciences. Stop trusting documentaries on linkTV, trade groups for organic farmers, and Green Peace.
 
 
If the people want the labels mandatory, make them mandatory.

Look, this is just like the "pink slime" business. Sure, there may be plenty of science saying GMO food is fine; but I don't see how that justifies denying a popular request that such food identify itself clearly on its label. It's neutral information in and of itself.

I seem to recall once seeing a label on a bottle of milk that said something along the lines of "This product contains no BGH" with a parenthetical about how the USDA has not found any harm in foods from sources using BGH. Why can't the new labels be like that?

At the very least, foods that don't use GMO should be allowed to put the fact on their label. It's a fair selling point.

Define "GMO". You begin to see the problems.
 
 
 
If the people want the labels mandatory, make them mandatory.

 
The issue is that designating foods with an all encompassing "GMO" label doesn't make any scientific sense. Same thing for disallowing GMO-containing products to be labeled as natural. Why single out GMO products? Do you want to promote bad science just because that's what the people want?

 
At the very least, foods that don't use GMO should be allowed to put the fact on their label. It's a fair selling point.

 
I have no problem with a manufacturer choosing to put a 'non-GMO' label on their product. AFAIK, that is legal (at least I think I have seen such labels before).

I'll go you one better. I'll predict people, or populations, that consume GMOs will do better in various measures than those that do not, in spite of any issues that crop up (so to speak.)

I don't know this will happen, but I will predict it confidently, based on the FUD-based tactics of the GMO (and other new trends, e.g. Olestra) crowd being indicative of...something other than reasonable science.

Of course, a broken clock is right twice a day, so once in awhile they will get lucky, though not through their own efforts of course. Would that outweigh the good they thwart in every other case?

Nobody studies that, either.

NAS does raise one flag in that the use of frankenseeds increases the use of glyphosate.

Some of the increased yields may be actually more a result of easier weed control than of anything inherent in the seeds themselves.

Conversely, weeds are now evolving to resist glyphosate. Win some, lose some, and there may still be a ticking time bomb that nobody has thought to test for, or for which there is no test to date.

Corporations are not, by definition, ethical.

Yes, the use of glyphosate resistant plants has led in an increase in the use of glyphosate. That's a no brainer. It's a good thing glyphosate is safer than many other herbicides and that the use of glyphosate has led to an increase in the practice of no till farming which is good for the environment.

Adding glyphosate resistance isn't going to change the yields based on magic, it increases yields because using glyphosate increases yields.

Glyphosate tolerant weeds may become a problem, similar to antibiotic resistance. That's the nature of life...it adapts. There could be a ticking time bomb, just like there good be a flying spaghetti monster, god, or tea cup orbiting jupiter. There no reason to believe such a ticking time bomb exists though.

You have a funny definition of ethical.

What are the historical trends w.r.t. measures of well-being in nations with and without corporations?

Corporations, or, more accurately, the economic freedom of which they are one consequence, shames all else.

If caring about people is your goal, that is.

When Hillary attacked "the unconscionable profits of drug companies", she was attacking the system, and people, who saved more lives than all her government projects put together.

I'll bet similar reality exists for Big Farm as Big Pharma.
