 
 
Which actors today, will be remebered in years to come?
 
 
---
 
 
Zooey Deschanel better be remembered  
 
 
Not Kristen Stewart. She is awful.
 
 
Keira Knightley
 
 
Elijah Wood. By me. <3
 
 
Hardly any. Maybe Di Caprio, and the "big budget film" actors who are remembered for their film rather than by virtue of their acting talent.
 
 
DiCaprio. He's been around for years but still keeps popping up in films. Clearly he has longevity.
 
 
daniel radcliffe
noone can forget harry potter  

lol at neg, you could ask the majority of people and they would know the harry potter films.
 
 
 
DiCaprio. He's been around for years but still keeps popping up in films. Clearly he has longevity.

 

yeah - i think most of his films are quite good aswell.
 
 
That guy, what's his name again........ Hmmmmm.......
 
 
Hopefully Johnny Depp, great actor imo. And Jack Black!
 
 
Joseph Gordon-Levitt
 
 
 

How could anybody forgot her?!    
 
 
I agree with DiCaprio. Maybe Johnny Depp.
 
 
David Tennant and Matt Smith. Nobody ever forgets the Doctor.  

And the Harry Potter people of course. They're not going to be forgotten in a hurry. I mean, it lasted ten years, a whole generation has grown up with it. Plus, there's some bloody talented actors and actresses in there.

And Colin Firth, of course.

Loads more, but I can't be bothered listing every single one.
 
 
brad pitt and leonardo dicaprio are both amazing actors and in a lot of classic films and i think they will be remembered more than most
 
 
 
David Tennant and Matt Smith. Nobody ever forgets the Doctor.  

And the Harry Potter people of course. They're not going to be forgotten in a hurry.

And Colin Firth, of course.

 

I loved David Tennant, - Donna was my favourite assistant  
 
 
Stallone
Arnold
Will Smith
Pacino
De Niro
Tom Hanks
Jim Carrey
Eddie Murphy
Marlon Brando
 
 
Charlie Sheen.
 
 
I suspect Gary Oldman will be appreciated in years to come. Johnny Depp is another.
 
 
 
Joseph Gordon-Levitt

 

Who?
 
 
 
I loved David Tennant, - Donna was my favourite assistant  

 

Catherine Tate is actually a pretty good actress. Yeah, Donna was fantastic but I think I'll like River more. Oh, Emma Thompson will be remembered as well.  
 
 
Samuel L Jackson.
 
 
Kevin Spacey, Cate Blanchett, Christian Bale. Also, it's hard to imagine Depp not being remembered, regardless of your opinion of his work. In fact, I suspect his reputation will only become more inflated with time.
 
 
Not an exhaustive list, of course, but a few that came to mind:
Anthony Hopkins
Judi Dench
Dustin Hoffman
Meryl Streep
Jack Nicholson
Clint Eastwood
Glenn Close
Kristin Scott Thomas
 
 
Did someone seriously mention Jack Black  

DiCaprio, Depp, Bale, Hanks are the ones that immediately spring to mind, but i'm not particularly with it today.
 
 
In the last few years, Emily Browning.
 
 
 
yeah - i think most of his films are quite good aswell.

 

True. His role in Inception sealed the deal I think. It's a film which I think will be considered a classic in years to come, and he played such a brilliant role in it.
 
 
 
Who?

 

 Clicky 
 
 
It has to be my all time favourite actor, Morgan Freeman.

I watched Shawshank Redemption for the billionth time last night, and I still find it amazing.
 
 
Johnny depp,
di caprio,
angelina jolie,
tom hanks,
robin williams,
julia roberts
...obviously many more but these came to mind  
 
 
HEATH LEDGER!!!

Di Caprio
Will Smith
J.Depp
 
 
johnny depp, hes a brilliant actor and hes just too beautiful.
 
 
Morgan Freeman
Jim Carrey
DiCaprio

That's the ones I can think of so far
 
 
 
HEATH LEDGER!!!

Di Caprio
Will Smith
J.Depp

 

I'd never even heard of Heath Ledger until he died  
 
 
James McAvoy I think, is a rising star. Already a star, but rising nonetheless  
 
 
 
 Clicky 

 

Sorry, I was just being a **** to try and prove a point  . Point being, how is an actor who's name is not widely known now really going to be remembered in "years to come?" (Although I've just read he's still young, so I see what you're getting at.)

Rightly or wrongly the actors who'll be remembered will be the big names. (Clooney, Brad Pitt, Di Caprio, Heath Ledger, Robert Pattinson etc.)

[Edit: I'm going to guess the neg was for mentioning Robert Pattinson? =P]
 
 
Johnny Depp
Orlando Bloom
Kate Winslet
Morgan Freeman
 
 
 
I'd never even heard of Heath Ledger until he died  

 

Same. But because he died, he'll be remembered for years to come.

River Pheonix anyone?
 
 
Di Caprio and Depp have it all. I reckon Brad Pitt has been really good in things like 'Meet Joe Black' and 'Burn After Reading'. Ohhh can't forget Heath either. Cate Blanchette too.
 
 
Colin Firth, definitely  

I want to say Heath Ledger too. I know he's not around anymore (   ) but he was a fantastic actor.
 
 
Judi Dench  
Daniel Craig

Very true. But trust me in a few years I feel that he will be well known. He's been in inception and is filming for the new Batman film so I reckon a few more high profile films will put him on the map  

O that reminds me I think Christian Bale will be remembered as a great actor. Especially method acting.
 
 
Di Caprio
 
 
Agree with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Also, Will Smith.
Probably Daniel Radcliffe.
Brad Pitt
Tom Hanks
Johnny Depp
Colin Firth

I actually can't think of many actresses that would probably last for ages.
 
 
When I cuddle up at night, I still wish that   will come and read me a bedtime story.
No homo.
 
 
Alan Rickman.

Legend.

oh and maybe Bruce Willis too?
 
 
Johnny Depp is majorly overrated, but unfortunately he'll probably be remembered as 'one of the greats'.
The likes of George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise will always be remembered.. even though they are something of a hasbeen nowadays; I don't understand how they are still classed as 'A-List stars'.

Personally, I think DiCaprio will be remembered, and in years to come I think Natalie Portman will really start to outshine her female counterparts

Also, Will Smith  
 
 
Viggo Mortensen? He's very versatile

You think that Depp is more overated than Will Smith?
 
 
Hugh jackman
 
 
Sir Ian Mckellan
Dame Judi Dench
Colin Firth (methinks he'll have a knighthood on the way)
Johnny Depp
Elijah Wood
Daniel Radcliff I suppose
 
 
Kevin Spacey, Christian Bale, Brad Pitt, Johnny Depp, Morgan Freeman, Danzel Washington, Bruce Willis, Jack Nicholson, George Clooney, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jude Law, Michael Caine, Hugh Jackman, Robert Downey Jr., Tom Hanks, Edward Norton, Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Matt Damon, Robin Williams, Samuel L. Jackson, Clint Eastwood, Ewan McGregor, Gerard Butler, Jason Statham. Couldn't forget any of them tbh...

Oh well, how could I have forgotten about Mr. Anthony Hopkins! Will Smith, John Travolta, Liam Neeson, Colin Farrell, Sean Penn, Russel Crowe, Ethan Hawke, Ben Affleck and Sam Rockwell (Yea, I know that he's only on his way up, but he's already great, Moon <3).
 
 
Why are people saying Daniel Radcliffe? He's such a terrible actor. They really should have gone with the guy from My Family instead  
 
 
Matt Damon
Angelina Jolie  
Brad Pitt
Tom Cruise
George Clooney
 
 
 
I suspect Gary Oldman will be appreciated in years to come. Johnny Depp is another.

 

Gary Oldman is waaay underrated in my pro opinion  
 
 
 
Kevin Spacey, Christian Bale, Brad Pitt, Johnny Depp, Morgan Freeman, Danzel Washington, Bruce Willis, Jack Nicholson, George Clooney, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jude Law, Michael Caine, Hugh Jackman, Robert Downey Jr., Tom Hanks, Edward Norton, Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Matt Damon, Robin Williams, Samuel L. Jackson, Clint Eastwood, Ewan McGregor, Gerard Butler, Jason Statham. Couldn't forget any of them tbh...

 

Robin Williams is amazing.   All the voices he can do just leaves me feeling very jealous. Oh well. And Ewan McGregor, definitely. Gerard Butler...eh, he's alright. He was good as the Phantom, I'll admit. Brilliant, in fact. Jude Law is fine when he's not in chick-flicks, Hugh Jackman isn't bad either, Denzel Washington is a legend, ditto most of the people on that list actually.
 
 
 
Gary Oldman is waaay underrated in my pro opinion  

 

Absolutely. He's a brilliant actor, I don't know why people don't realise that actually. But to me the most underrated actor has to be John Simm. Then again, I'm obsessed. But still, he's a bloody good actor, better than a fair few people who are more famous.
 
 
 
Why are people saying Daniel Radcliffe? He's such a terrible actor. They really should have gone with the guy from My Family instead  

 

Because a whole generation grew up with Harry Potter so he'll be remembered as Harry even if he's not the most stunning actor. He does a good job though. Harry Potter has some amazing people in there, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Gary Oldman, Imelda Staunton, Maggie Smith (of course), Jason Isaacs is amazing as well, oh hell, there's loads of amazing actors in it. I'll be here all day listing them.
 
 
 

Yes? No? Maybe...
 
 
 
James McAvoy I think, is a rising star. Already a star, but rising nonetheless  

 

Watched a bit of him in The Last King of Scotland and as well as being adorable,   he seemed pretty talented. Seen him in other stuff as well but as far as I'm concerned the only way to judge how good an actor really is is to shove some emotional stuff on them.
 
 
Yeah, definitely De Niro and Tom Hanks. But, also, you can't forget Meryl Streep or Jack Nicholson
 
 
Adam Sandler and Seth Rogen will always be remembered by me.
 
 
Nicole Kidman
Johnny Depp
Helena Bonham Carter
Kate Beckinsale
Julia Roberts

I haven't seen him in anything other than human traffic, and had to google his name to even realise who it was lol. So yeah i guess you're right

Well, being a major Dr Who fan I saw him in that, and he's seriously good. Saw him in another film as well and he made me cry.   Oh, now I remember. It was Skellig, which is a book too awful for words. Wouldn't actually watch the film if it wasn't for John Simm.
 
 
I know it's not in film but on television, but Brian Cranston's performance in Breaking Bad is one of the greatest I have ever seen.

That and Samuel L Jackson as Jules in Pulp Fiction.
 
 
 
Adam Sandler and Seth Rogen will always be remembered by me.

 

     

No!!!!

This thread has been tainted by the very mention of his name...*walks away shaking head sadly*
 
 
Jonny Depp and Leonardo DiCaprio are both excellent actors who have been in some iconic films, as well as being very good-looking (although I personally don't find DiCaprio very attractive).

I think Colin Firth will certainly be remembered for Brits, especially since The King's Speech. He's already become something of a national treasure. Kate Winslett has been in some pretty acclaimed films as well.

Haven't actually seen much with DiCaprio other than Titanic, and I was ten when I saw that and too upset by it to notice his acting. Johnny Depp is actually a good actor, he's really good at the crazy roles, like the Mad Hatter (brilliant) and he wasn't bad as Willy Wonka either, even though that character is off his head.  

And Colin Firth is amazing, he'd better be remembered. I'm sure he will. I have a friend who has a serious man-crush on him.

Wait....not only do you not like Adam Sandler, but you DISLIKE him?

Yes! He's awful and so are the films he's in. Click, Mr Deeds, Bedtime Stories, all rubbish. In my opinion. But I guess everyone has their own tastes, even if yours are rather dubious...
 
 
daniel craig for playing james bond..
 
 
Will Smith's a decent shout

**** off they aint no adam sandler films.

Big Daddy, Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, The Water Boy.....

Never even heard of bedtime stories, and click was rubbish. Mr Deeds is ok.

I first realised how good an actor DiCaprio was in What's Eating Gilbert Grape? (also starring Jonny Depp) where he played a developmentally disabled boy. It was such a change from his usual pretty-boy roles that I actually noticed his acting skills and he's really excellent.

Mr Deeds is atrocious. It's so boring! Of all the actors in the world, why him?

I keep meaning to watch that but I never have. It can go on my very long and still-growing list of things to watch.
 
 
Well, I hope actors like Christian Bale, Denzel Washington, Kevin Spacey, Jack Nicholson, Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Morgan Freeman and Liam Neeson will be rememebered, they all have merits, both in terms of dedication to their trade as well as supurb acting abilities.

I guess he remind me of my self a little but. I guess you could say I can see the edd360 in Adam Sandler.

Watch Happy Gilmore and if you still have the same opinion of him I won't believe you.

Fine, I will. But judging on the films I have seen him in (which is a fair few actually), he's nothing to shout about. In return, go and watch the episodes of Doctor Who called "The Sound of Drums" and "The Last of the Time Lords." If you don't love John Simm after that, you're heartless.

How did I forget Liam Neeson?! He's brilliant. And Robert De Niro of course, but that goes without saying. Same with Morgan Freeman. Is there anyone who actually doesn't like Morgan Freeman?

Alrighty then.
 
 
Anthony Hopkins?

Happy Gilmore's at times a funny film but Sandlers acting is nothing to shout about.
 
 
Colin Firth
Johnny Depp
Helena Bonham Carter
Leonardo DiCaprio
Kenneth Branagh
Ewan Mcgregor?
Tom Hanks
Morgan Freeman
Arnold Swartzenegger
Liam Neeson
Ian Mckellen
Christopher Lee
Patrick Stewart
Keira Knightly
Antony Hopkins
Sean Connary
Rachel Weisz?

Daniel Radcliffe
Emma Thompson

Kenneth Branagh is pretty damn amazing actually. Love watching Much Ado About Nothing, the combination of him, Emma Thompson, Kate Beckinsale and Denzel Washington is absolutely stunning.  
 
 
Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, DeCaprio, Edward Norton, Charlie Sheen...
 
 
Tom Hanks.
 
 
 
How did I forget Liam Neeson?! He's brilliant. And Robert De Niro of course, but that goes without saying. Same with Morgan Freeman. Is there anyone who actually doesn't like Morgan Freeman?

 

I don't know! Quite a few people forget him, but I don't think people really think of him when it comes to 'big' actors, but he's done some very good work such as Kinsey and of course Schindlers List, but overall definitely an underrated actor. I think the question is more how could anyone not like Morgan Freeman!
 
 
Matt Damon
 
 
Jim Carrey.

An absolute genius.
 
 
 
Gary Oldman is waaay underrated in my pro opinion  

 

i think so too - but sometimes thats a good thing. Plus I think its probably more his own decision to not be in the public eye so much, if he wanted to he could be attending all the award shows and making a scene and then he'd be just as well known as some Hollywood actors.
 
 
 
Gary Oldman is waaay underrated in my pro opinion  

 

I was talking to the gf about what films he's been in last night and it blew her mind that it was the same actor, she had no idea!

Seen him in a couple of things and he's really good. And yeah, Morgan Freeman is impossible to dislike. I'm certain of it.
 
 
 
I was talking to the gf about what films he's been in last night and it blew her mind that it was the same actor, she had no idea!

 

Yeah, took me a while into Batman to realise it was the same guy who plays Sirius Black. Just shows how good he is I guess. He's brilliant.
 
 
 
I suspect Gary Oldman will be appreciated in years to come. Johnny Depp is another.

 

I usually like his work but I absolutely hated his performance in Dracula, then again that whole film was just offensive to the book

Joseph Gordon-Levitt

Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves were worse I thought.
 
 
Caprio for sure :-)

and after watching Inglorious Basterds ( which is an AMAZING movie) I'm really pinning for Christopher Waltz and Melanie Laurent

this was by far my favorite chapter in IB:

 

Harry Potter and Colin Firth too :-)

In Women I really hope people will remember Marion Cotillard.
 
 
Martial Arts actors that would be remembered in years to come are Jet Li and Jackie Chan

Di Caprio, Brad Pitt, Will Smith and Denzel Washington would definitely be remembered in years to come
 
 
 
You think that Depp is more overated than Will Smith?

 

Hmm not really, I find Depp very boring to watch; he's essentially the same weird, quirky and/or pseudo artistic role everytime.
Will Smith usually plays similar character granted, but I find him enjoyable to watch - Depp makes me feel awkward.
And about the overrated-ness also, I find Johnny Depp to be overrated because of the before-mentioned 'pseudo-artistic' nature of his acting... I didn't know rambling around the place with jittery eyes and hand motions qualified as being artistic  

The whole things subjective though and I can understand why people like him.
 
 
James Franco
 
 
 

 

 
 
 
Steven Seagal
 
 
 
 
 
In mois opinion, actors will be more likely remembered based mainly on windsome good looks/starring in an 'iconic' film rather than acting skillz. So J.Depp, B.Pitt and L. Dicaprio are all likely candidates, as, er..everyone's already said...  

And of course Willy Smithy! Everyone hearts him.
