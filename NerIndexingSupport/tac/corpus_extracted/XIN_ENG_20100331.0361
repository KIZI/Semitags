The Kenyan team to the World Cross Country Championships in Poland was rewarded
by President Mwai Kibaki on Wednesday for their historic performance in the
championships.

The President presented the winners with cash awards totaling 2.75 million
shillings as a token of appreciation from the government for raising the
national flag high throughout the competition.

"I congratulate you all for your sterling performance.  I also thank your
coaches, officials, sponsors, family members and all those who have contributed
to your success," the President told the team.

Gold medalists received a total of 550,000 shillings, silver 350, 000 shillings
and Bronze 200,000 shillings from the government and the sponsor, Kenya
Commercial Bank.

The government has since the introduction of the cash scheme disbursed over 120
million shillings, the President said.

The President noted the cross country team's performance was one of the most
emphatic that Kenya has ever returned in the world of sport, adding that their
victory was so convincing that they stamped Kenya's authority in cross country
running.

"Your achievements made Kenya reinstate its position as the home of the world's
best cross country runners.  This is the kind of achievement that our sportsmen
and women should aim for in their respective sports disciplines," Kibaki said.

President Kibaki recalled that the nation was filled with a great sense of pride
last Sunday as the Kenyan athletics team to Poland won race after race, emerging
with four individual gold medals, four team gold medals and also scooping other
silver and bronze medals.

He said the discipline and prowess the country shows in athletics must be
embraced and emulated by other Kenyans.

He, therefore, appealed to all sports federations to put in place mechanisms
that will ensure that Kenya excels in more sports disciplines.

In recognition and appreciation of the achievements made so far, President
Kibaki said the Government has been steadily increasing its budgetary allocation
on sports programmes.

The President pointed out that this financial year alone, the government has
allocated 1.5 billion shillings for the improvement of sports facilities
countrywide. In addition, President Kibaki said the government is spending more
funds at the grassroots level.

"For example we have budgeted 250 million shillings for running programmes at
the district level.  This is aimed at identifying sporting talent of our
youngsters and developing it further," he said.

The President said the Government is also investing more than 200 million
shillings in the African Senior Athletes championship which it will be hosting,
adding that it will also be putting up the required warm-up track.

Other programmes which are on-going, the President said, involve the partnership
and support from corporate organizations like National Bank, Kenya Commercial
Bank and New KCC.

"I thank them and other sponsors for their support for sports in our country. I
also thank private companies who have come in to supplement the government cash
award scheme that we introduced a few years ago," President Kibaki said.

During the occasion, President Kibaki presented the national flag to the golf
going to represent the country in Botswana at the Africa Zone six Golf
Championships.

He noted that at the championship the golf team will meet the strongest teams
from Africa and urged them to emulate the winning ways of the cross country team
and bring back victory.

To other sporting teams, President Kibaki assured them of his government's total
commitment to taking sports to the next level.

President Kibaki reassured managers of the various sports disciplines in the
country of the government total commitment to provide the support required to
maintain the sporting tempo and sustained development of local sporting
infrastructure.

Youth and Sports Minister Prof. Helen Sambili advised successful athletes in the
country to ensure prudent use the prize money received from the government and
sponsors.

Prof Sambili also congratulated the cross country team for doing the country
proud by winning all the titles on offer at the Poland event.

Kenya has won 20 out the 25 cross country events the country has participated
in, the minister said.
