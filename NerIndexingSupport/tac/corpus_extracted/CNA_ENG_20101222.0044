A Taiwan journalist association hit back at the World Taekwondo Federation (WTF)
Wednesday over a comment about sports reporting in Taiwan, advising WTF
officials to "watch your words and beware of your behavior."

The Chinese Taipei Sports Journalism Federation was upset by WTF accusations
that Taiwanese media were fanning anti-Korean sentiments in their reports about
the disqualification of Taiwanese taekwondo athlete Yang Shu-chun at the Asian
Games in Guangzhou, China in November.

In a decision published Tuesday, the WTF slapped a 3-month ban on Yang and a
20-month suspension on her coach Liu Tsung- ta for staging a ringside protest
after Yang was disqualified during a match in the 49-kg division event.

Upset by the WTF's implications that the Taiwanese media were manipulating their
reports about the controversial event,  the Taiwanese sports journalist
association lodged a protest with WTF President Chungwon Choue.

The group said Taiwanese journalists have been reporting the controversy over
Yang's disqualification on the basis of facts and eye witness accounts.

It is regrettable that the WTF has used biased and provocative language to
allude to the Taiwanese media, the sports journalism federation said.

It urged Choue to take note of the fact that Taiwan is a democracy in which all
citizens enjoy freedom of expression.

All the Taiwanese media that covered the Yang Shu-chun incident had sent their
own reporters  to Guangzhou  and they worked independently without bias, the
federation said.

The group said the Asian Taokwondo Union's accusation against the Taiwanese
athlete was wrong and that WTF Secretary General Yang Jin-suk had hurt the
Taiwan team at the Asian Games in Guangzhou.
