Think he's hoping to take another run at it, or is it just a ploy to keep taking donations to pay off campaign debt?

Or..........is he gonna do a Palin?
 
 
Option B.
 
 
Why does it matter what he does? Even without these allegations, he is a complete joke. He's never had a chance of winning the nomination.
 
 
This is almost painful to watch.

Plan A - become President

Plan B - start a website!!!

...holy crap, how lame can you get!
 
 
well, that eliminates that option.

Pretty lame.......right now he's closing with the lyrics from Pokemon.
 
 
Suspended.

 Herman Cain suspends presidential campaign 
 
 
Congratulations left wing haters. You brought a black man down. I hope we can reciprocate next November..

     
 
 
Cain has a good woman.

I hope he deserves her.
 
 
Yanno............from pretty much everything he's said, it looks like he's actually gonna do the route of Palin. Start a website, get lots of donations and turn it into a PAC.

He's even said to look for an endorsement of a candidate soon.

Well......like he said.........at least he made it to the Final 4.
 
 
 
Cain has a good woman.

I hope he deserves her.

 

She's a cute little thing.
 
 
Cain will endorse Newt soon, guaranteed.

Oh and liability?? HAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHHAHA

Once again you back a Loser. Just like Fred, now you are 0 for 2. Maybe three but i didnt see if you backed McCain or not.
 
 
 
Cain will endorse Newt soon, guaranteed.

 

based on what evidence?
 
 
 
Congratulations left wing haters. You brought a black man down. I hope we can reciprocate next November..

     

 

Actually, it was the 2 women he'd sexually harassed that were paid 1 year salary settlements, the one that came forward about being sexually harassed in his car, as well as the woman who came out about the 13 year affair.

Interestingly enough, the text messages (and probably the money) stopped around the time that Cain announced his candidacy, and since she didn't have money or the ability to contact him, she got a bit pissed and came out about the affair.

Nope........Cain did it to himself.

I'm not the one that had the affair Willow........Cain was.
 
 
If your the religious type say a prayer for his family. I'll just silently wish them well.
 
 
Actually - a friend of Ginger White's was the tipster. She informed eff-all everybody in the media about the affair, and Ginger was buried by the press requests for more info. So she came clean.

Left wing haters. You had no problem with Clinton's affairs and allegations of molestation and rape.. It boils down to left wing haters..

We'll see in 6 months.
 
 
 
Congratulations left wing haters. You brought a black man down. I hope we can reciprocate next November..

It was never going to stop. The left has an endless supply of women willing to say anything for a buck.

He's been Palinized. A so far successful tactic.

What's almost too painful to watch is the overt racism of the left that blacks belong to them and any black courageous enough to defy you will be destroyed. Thomas, Condie, et al. And the path Powell was on until he succumbed to your attempts to lynch him.

I take that back, you ARE too painful to watch, there's nothing "almost" about it.

You don't have to be religious to pray. God listens to everyone.

The only worthwhile takeaway here,

this is good news for Obama. One less splitter of the not-Romney vote means that the comical Newt Gingrich has an even better chance of winning the nomination.

The big difference there is that there was actually evidence of Edwards affair. And a huge media coverup.

There is still no concrete evidence of anything Cain did.
 
 
 
the left wing liberal blacks will never tolerate a black Republican. they're the biggest racists on the planet.

 

They're fine with blacks as long as they're obedient and repeat after them. The ones who are truly sad are the liberal blacks who are liberal before they are black and not only go along with it but lead the charge. If they were black first, they would be appalled by the left's behavior. And they applaud it. Pathetic.
 
 
 
Yanno..........I'm wondering if Cain's wife is gonna stay with him or go Elizabeth Edwards on his ass?

Her responses during his adios speech were very ernest. I believe she will stay with him unless further evidence surfaces. And sometimes you just forgive.

Why on earth would we want our own Obama? That's the dumbest thing ive ever heard. We want someone competant.

Only if Michele Bachmann wasn't willing to put out in exchange for Cain's endorsement.

Hmm, the path to victory for Republicans is a candidate as close to Obama as possible. So you're saying the left don't like Obama either and will go for a Liberal Republican? How exactly does your plan of beating Obama with Romney work?

I'd say we both know Romney is the best way for the Republicans to lose, which is why you ache for him so badly.

Gramps you don't even know what a "troll" is... Just like you don't understand foreign policy, hence your support for Cain then Newt.

Anyways I agree with you Gramps, Cain will prolly endorse Newt. I think Cain ill endorse Newt because that is what he thinks people want to hear and he is working damage control to his name at this point.

BTW Gramps, did you hear about the new defense bill that has expansions to destroying the constitution in the name of the "War on Terror?" Looks like Newt might get what he wants, you know an expansion of the patriot act. Remember that video you love to put up of Paul calling Newt out for what he is? Yeah, youre getting your way lol

In the end it sounds like your upset because you supported (prolly even gave money to) a man with a serious lack of morals. A man that has lied uncontrollably and now as a way out you want to blame the "liberal Media" lol.

If Cain had any meaningful positions past 999 none of this would have overwhelmed his candidacy. Cain left a giant wide open void to be filled and so it was exploited. Now it seems Cain in fact had a 13 year long affair, nice choice of candidate lol. But by all means, dont take responsibility for you actions in supporting him and attack me for supporting Paul, who the best attack you have is he has baggy eye, at like 76 years old

How quickly these hacks have forgotten the meretricious and disgraceful behavior of Bill Clinton while he was in office. Oh how the hypocrisy lives on. Just proves how frightened they all are of H.C. I don't think this is the last of him and don't be surprised if he turns out to be someone's running mate!

Willow & I agree on one point..... there is NO evidence that he had an affair, and the other allegations have not been proved either.
Until then, I will continue to stand with him.

I am disappointed he is bowing out for now.

He should insist that the texts be made public.

Plus, I have made it VERY clear in several previous posts in the hundreds of threads poking fun at Herman Cain, that if he admitted to wrong doings or was ACTUALLY proven to be a liar... I would NOT support him as POTUS.

I am a man of my word.... I wouldnt support a guy that will lie over and over just to save face.
(i.e. John Edwards, Bill Clinton, Anthony Weiner, and client #9...my list is endless)
 
 
 
Think he's hoping to take another run at it, or is it just a ploy to keep taking donations to pay off campaign debt?

Or..........is he gonna do a Palin?

 

All of the above except that I think he's going for the Newt spot. Cain's main experience is in lobbying and Newt has made a good living selling ice to the DC Eskimos. He's got a lot of campaign debt and this way he can sell more snake oil.

Meanwhile, he'll whip out a few more books, do the talk shows and Fox. If his wife will allow it, he could even put a recording studio in his home like $arah did and call it in from his Barcalounger.

Did anyone else notice... ? The best part of that "announcement" was when they pulled the curtain back to reveal his - HUH? There was nothing there! Funny stuff.

On this we agree Gramps...

If the left was as vigilant with the vetting of Obama or ANY of their leaders or his staff members, I would be OK with all of this, but this was just a nasty smear campaign that I suspect was launched by the GOP. Yep, I said it.... the GOP

Very well and accurately stated, WT.  

I hope Ginger White enjoys her profits for helping to bring an effective leader down, and that Karma takes it's toll. Unless one has no sense of pride, one cannot improve their lives, by ruining another's. She successfully deprived him of winning or losing of his own volition. Shame on the bitch !!!
 
 
If it turns out to be true that the GOP conspired to get Mr Cain out of the way, then we are in a lot more trouble than we know. The breadth of corruption on both sides of the aisle is exactly why we need to get rid of all of them and start all over.
 
 
BDBoop

 
All he had to do was ride out the storm. An innocent man would have done so.

His actions are those of a guilty man.

 

Pretty hard to deny the evidence -

Two women were paid hush money at the same time he was fired 6 months before his contract was up. May not be related but why was he fired from Godfather's Pizza?

And, he admitted he had been giving money to the Ginger for 13 years, and that the purpose of the money was for her to live on even though he said 'if you're not a millionaire, if you don't have a job, blame yourself'.

If he's so innocent, why didn't he demand records from his lobbyist days be made public? Why didn't he sue Ginger and subpoena the cell records? Because if he had done that, she could have subpoenaed very recent hotel records and probably more.

He's in deep. Its "he said - they said" and he also said there were likely to be more women come forward with "lies". If he had come clean and done the Jimmy Swaggart crying and teeth-gnashing thing, the teaparty would have embraced him. What the heck, the evangelicals still love him and there's lots of bags in that group.

More important is that he's not qualified to do much of anything except sell himself and its was always a book selling tour. So, like so many other failed pubs, he's in exactly the right place.

In any event, he'll do just fine and his poor wife won't have to do any more Stepford wife, frozen-smile, stand-by-your-man appearances.

Honestly don't you think past questionable associations with bad people is more important than someone's sex life?

I do, but you guys still elected Obama so don't even go there with the lack of vetting bullshit.

 

who gives a shit about who cain fucked or tried to. Look how he acted, look at how he answered policy. The man is not fit to run a jack in the box.

The Sex thing was only the prop in order to see Cains downfall.

I hope Ginger White enjoys her profits for helping to bring an effective leader down, and that Karma takes it's toll. Unless one has no sense of pride, one cannot improve their lives, but ruining another's. She successfully deprived him of winning or losing of his own volition. Shame on the bitch!!!

 

Shame on any and everybody who has condemned him with 0 evidence to back it all up.

Hearsay has brought a good man down..... I swear this would not be tolerated by the left if it was one of their guys. The media would cover for them too...  
 
 
 
Think he's hoping to take another run at it, or is it just a ploy to keep taking donations to pay off campaign debt?

Congrats on the distraction moonbats, Fast and Furious, nothing to see here, billions of dollars laundered through green energy companies, nothing to see here.

Bingo.

The gory details should have been between him and his wife/family. What is the business of the American voter was that he just kept lying. But, even that isn't as important as his arrogant refusal to read a newspaper, learn about the issues, educate himself.

He's a motivational preacher/speaker. That's where his talent is. That's why he got away with being utterly ignorant about the United States and the rest of the world.

For Pete's sake, one of the first things he said was that he would not accept a bill that ran longer than three pages!

Tell it to Anthony Weiner. He didn't actually DO anything but the Dems drummed him out.

The list of pubs who have been caught is quite long and some of the are still lining their pockets with the taxpayer's money.

Cain did this to him self just as Weiner did. The evidence is enormous against Cain but he had to lie about it. Same with Weiner.

So why is Mr Cain unqualified to be President? I believe B. O. is the least qualified person to ever become President. Mr Cain was at least a CEO and successful businessman. What credentials did or does Obama have? Community dis-organizer, communist sympathizer, the friend of known terrorists...wow...with such an impeccable list as this...why I've been mislead-disenfranchised-disparaged...Obama, Obama, Obama. I need a new kitchen and car. Can I get a bailout?

Go back to your tent, grab a law book and re-read the section on "evidence" about 100 times......
 
 
I think it's safe to say that Cain didn't need the "left-wing liberal" vote to win the GOP nomination. What brought him down was the reaction of religious conservatives, not us. Attributing his downfall, not even in a general election but in a run for the Republican nomination, to "left-wing liberals" takes irrationality to a new level.

As already noted, Cain brought himself down.

With every statement he exhibited his ignorance of the Constitution, the law, and public policy.

Indeed, most democrats would rather Cain be rejected on the grounds of his wrongheaded policy positions rather than his affairs and acts of sexual harassment.

 
How quickly these hacks have forgotten the meretricious and disgraceful behavior of Bill Clinton while he was in office. Oh how the hypocrisy lives on.

 

But remember: the hypocrisy cuts both ways, as republicans attacked Clinton for his affairs, they now defend Cain for doing the same thing.

Otherwise, the circle the wagons mentality of the right is telling.

You won't. Remember, you racist white conservatives were just saying that Cain would be the first black president. That Obama wasn't black. So what black man are you going to bring down? You worthless fuckers are so full of shit.
 
 
now if you can just get obama to do the same thing? Isn't that what you racist want, to get rid of all the blacks out of white mans politics?

That little exercise in futility didn't work.

 
Ginger White: Her phone bill has 61 calls or texts from Herman Cain (video)

Ginger White, who says she had a 13-year affair with Herman Cain, showed reporters her phone bill. There were 61 texts or calls from Herman Cain.

 

 Ginger White: Her phone bill has 61 calls or texts from Herman Cain (video) - CSMonitor.com 
 
 
Ginger apologizes.

 Ginger White to Gloria Cain: 'I'm deeply sorry' for Herman Cain alleged affair - Pop2it - Zap2it 

Interesting.

 
White maintains the affair started in the late 1990s in Louisville, KY and continued for 13 years. She also made the distinction that "it wasn't a love affair, it was a sexual affair." Cain says he was merely helping White financially and that these were more false allegations levied against him.

 

I'm glad she made that distinction. It might give Mrs. Cain some small measure of relief.
 
 
 
The whole attack on Cain is a deflection and now moonbats are whining about deflection?.....

 

Yes. The long-term, sexploits of that married man are a deflection from his lack of basic knowledge about current events as they relate to the U.S.
 
 
I told you cooning Cain wouldn't last until Christmas. This whole mess is just a byproduct of his cooning. How many wives on this board would excuse their husbands paying a woman's bills and rent for 13 years, calling her 61(including in late night) in a couple months and you never heard of her before?
 
 
Good point. Would any of the people here defending his behavior be as accepting in their own marriage?

And there always HAS to be SOMEONE ELSE TO BLAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!

No Conservative can ever be at fault! Conspiracies and boogey men prowl in the shadows just waiting to trip up the righteous and the Conservative.

What a crock! Even for you, willow, this stretch is beneath contempt.

I guess it's really true then. American Exceptionalism means never having to say you're sorry. Never accept blame. Eschew culpability. Say it over and over and over again until it starts to faintly ring true and then cling like hell to that little twig of illusion.
 
 
Yeah, remember that Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy that brought down Clinton?

Anyway, good. The campaigns are somewhat microcosms of how each candidate will govern. I dont care whether Cain had affairs or not. It doesnt matter. "It's just sex" right?
But his handling of it shows that he has poor judgment or poor advisors or both. We don't need someone else in the White House like that.
So we winnow the field to the most qualified (hint: he is from Texas. Second hint, he never served in Congress).
 
 
 
 
The only worthwhile takeaway here,

this is good news for Obama. One less splitter of the not-Romney vote means that the comical Newt Gingrich has an even better chance of winning the nomination.

 

Hmm, the path to victory for Republicans is a candidate as close to Obama as possible. So you're saying the left don't like Obama either and will go for a Liberal Republican? How exactly does your plan of beating Obama with Romney work?

I'd say we both know Romney is the best way for the Republicans to lose, which is why you ache for him so badly.

 

When you move to the right you move towards voters that are already on your side. When you move towards the center you move towards voters that are up for grabs.

What has color to do with it?

Why do the pubs always mention President Obama's color and then say his color isn't why they hate him.

If color isn't your deciding factor, why say you want to bring down a black man?

As for Cain, he brought it on himself. He (and you) can whine all he wants but it wasn't the LIB-rules who paid hush money to two women just as Cain was fired. Wasn't Libs who called Ginger 61 times, including in the middle of the night. He can't deny it. You can't deny it. CAIN did that.

Speaking only for myself, I'm sorry to see him go. He was great comic fodder.

Actually, I don't remember Clinton ever being "brought down."

What's interesting is that all of you folks looking for scapegoats and excuses seem to assign such overwhelming power to the left in this country. Here we are, never realizing we had total control over the entire culture and politics, to the extent we can exercise veto power over who the Republicans nominate. How astonishing!

I'll tell you, that's news to me! I'm going to have to seriously think about how we can make use of this omnipotence, 'cause it sure will come in handy!

i guess.....

So then willowtree and infidel agreeing is the same no?

 

Willow & I agree on one point..... there is NO evidence that he had an affair, and the other allegations have not been proved either.
Until then, I will continue to stand with him.

I am disappointed he is bowing out for now.

He should insist that the texts be made public.

Plus, I have made it VERY clear in several previous posts in the hundreds of threads poking fun at Herman Cain, that if he admitted to wrong doings or was ACTUALLY proven to be a liar... I would NOT support him as POTUS.

I am a man of my word.... I wouldnt support a guy that will lie over and over just to save face.
(i.e. John Edwards, Bill Clinton, Anthony Weiner, and client #9...my list is endless)

Cain gots to stop cheating and harassing woman.

 

Don't hold your breath. This is undoubtedly a life long habit and will continue until his death.

But, at least his poor wife won't have to be humiliated in public next time.
 
 
 
 
 
The only worthwhile takeaway here,

this is good news for Obama. One less splitter of the not-Romney vote means that the comical Newt Gingrich has an even better chance of winning the nomination.

 

Hmm, the path to victory for Republicans is a candidate as close to Obama as possible. So you're saying the left don't like Obama either and will go for a Liberal Republican? How exactly does your plan of beating Obama with Romney work?

I'd say we both know Romney is the best way for the Republicans to lose, which is why you ache for him so badly.

 

When you move to the right you move towards voters that are already on your side. When you move towards the center you move towards voters that are up for grabs.

 

What do you know about the "center?"
 
 
Now that the left's whipping boy is gone can we start talking about the real issues
Such as a failed economy or a failed government?
 
 
 
 
The whole attack on Cain is a deflection and now moonbats are whining about deflection?.....

 

Yes. The long-term, sexploits of that married man are a deflection from his lack of basic knowledge about current events as they relate to the U.S.

 

Peanuts, the real deflection is as long they're demonizing Cain, no attention is on Obama and Holder. Moonbats know it's true, they're just disingenuous partisan hacks, but whatcha gonna do?....

Think he's hoping to take another run at it, or is it just a ploy to keep taking donations to pay off campaign debt?

Or..........is he gonna do a Palin?

 

Some have speculated that Cain may have fathered a lovechild with Ginger White. If that is true, that should be the thing that keeps Herman from ever attempting a dumb stunt like this again. Never seeing or hearing of Cain again would be too soon in my book.

Good. Riddance. to bad. Rubbish.

AND STAY OUT!!!!!!

Sure, let's talk about how much of a colossal failure CONGRESS is.
How the teabag freshmen hasn't created any jobs like they promised.
How instead, the teabag freshman created more gridlock and intransigence in Congress.
Sure, let's get back to the issues at hand.

In his announcement, Cain blamed the media for spinning his campaign. And his supporters, as well as some conservative commentators, will likely continue to blame the media, Democrats and the women who spoke out against him for his campaign's demise. They will bemoan the campaign trail as an ugly place that eats its unsuspecting victims alive. But as unprepared as Cain may have been for life in the political spotlight and the invasive cavity search that is performed on presidential hopefuls, the truth is he was far less prepared to actually be our president.

He can't blame the media for his fumbles on foreign policy, or his inability to explain his own position on abortion. Nor can he blame Democrats or his alleged victims for his failure to sell his 9-9-9 plan as the solution to all of our ills.

Herman Cain is not a victim. He's a man who decided he deserved the highest vote of confidence the country could give him. And though he may be a genuine, likable and thoughtful person with some good ideas, he did not deserve that vote.

Herman Cain knew what he didn't know. He should have realized that it was too much to be president.

That RW palooka got caught up by his own hype. He allowed his adoring RW radio fans to pump up his already bloated big head into thinking he had a legitimate shot at Presidency.

Well, he sure found out that that was not the case.

WHAPS!!!!!

Typical conservative victimhood

They are not responsible for their poor choices......it is the medias reporting on those choices
 
 
I appreciated the author taking the stand she did. That shows me that what I see on this board is not representative of the typical conservative. Nor is Rush Limbaugh or Glenn Beck or Ann Coulter.
 
 
 
 
 
bullshit and you know it - the same shit was done to Sarah Palin

 

All Republican voters have to do is ignore it and go on supporting their candidates. I assure you, I have no intention of voting in the GOP primary, so whether or not I support Cain makes, at this point, no difference at all to his chances.

 

At least we vette ours  

You will mindlessly vote for Obama and that proves my point  

 

If you actually "vetted" anyone, then why was there Palin, Perry, Cain and Romney?

All of 'em have skeletons. Just ask Cain.

And..........if you don't believe that there was actually an affair, why was it that Cain told Hannity not to go playing detective? It was on this week, and when Hannity asked Cain about the possiblity of tracking airline tickets, as well as looking at cameras (last time she said they were in Vegas at the Hollyfield fight), Cain then told Hannity to "not go playing detective"?

Nope, sorry.........Cain's trying to hide something.

Well if we are going to discuss the issues we should at least start with an honest discussion.
1. the tea party did not campaign in 2008-2010 about creating jobs They were sent to DC to do exactly what they have been doing. Stopping the progressive dangerous legislation of the democratic controlled congress of 2007-2011. They did their job.
2. Why did the democratic controlled congress start working on jobs the last two years they were in control with a democratic president?
3. but you can remain partisan because what the recent congress both house and senate have done have really fuck Americas rights with the lasy bill both chambers have passed.
