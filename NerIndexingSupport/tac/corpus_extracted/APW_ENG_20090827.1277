A dark cloud over Gov. Bill Richardson's political future has lifted after the federal government's decision against indictments in an investigation that prompted the governor to withdraw his nomination as U.S. commerce secretary earlier this year.

Political analysts said the yearlong probe's end could even revive Richardson's chances of finding a place in President Barack Obama's administration in the future. The governor's second term expires at the end of 2010 and he can't seek re-election.

Richardson took office as governor in 2003, having served as a congressman from New Mexico, a roving diplomatic troubleshooter and as President Bill Clinton's energy secretary and U.N. ambassador.

Recently, Richardson has returned to the diplomatic limelight. He met with a delegation of North Koreans earlier this month in Santa Fe and the governor was in Cuba this week for a trade mission.

"The cloud over his head has dissipated," Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, said Thursday. "The Land of Enchantment is the land of second chances now for Bill Richardson."

The Democratic governor and former high-ranking members of his administration won't be criminally charged in an investigation of how lucrative state bond work went to one of the governor's large political donors, according to two people familiar with the case. The decision not to seek indictments was made by Justice Department officials in Washington, they said, speaking on condition they not be identified because prosecutors had not disclosed results of the probe.

"It's over. There's nothing. It was killed in Washington," one of the people told The Associated Press.

A department spokesman declined to comment on the case and whether Attorney General Eric Holder played a role in deciding not to pursue charges.

The agency's silence drew criticism from New Mexico Republican Party chairman Harvey Yates Jr., who said Holder should provide "transparent and honest answers" about who was responsible for the decision to end the investigation without indictments.

The U.S. attorney office in New Mexico began an investigation last year into the hiring of a Richardson political donor, Beverly Hills-based CDR Financial Products Inc., as a financial adviser on state transportation bond deals. The state work generated almost $1.5 million in fees for CDR in 2004-2005.

CDR chief executive David Rubin and his firm contributed $110,000 to Richardson political committees in 2003-2005. The largest of those contributions, $75,000, was made less than a week before CDR was selected in June 2004 by the New Mexico Finance Authority to handle the reinvestment of idle bond proceeds.
