The Miami Heat signed veteran guard Jerry Stackhouse Saturday, just one day
after learning that Mike Miller will miss a substantial amount of time with an
hand injury.

Miami is the 35-year-old Stackhouse's sixth National Basketball Association
club. Stackhouse averaged 8.5 points in 42 games as a reserve for the Milwaukee
Bucks last season.

Stackhouse said during the summer that he wanted a chance to join LeBron James,
Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in Miami. Wade and James said they would welcome
Stackhouse if the Heat made a deal.

Swingman Miller will likely be sidelined until at least January with a right
thumb injury that required surgery.
