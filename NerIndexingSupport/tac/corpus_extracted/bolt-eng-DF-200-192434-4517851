 
 
Does anybody like Daniel Radcliffe?
 
 
Just sat here watching Harry Potter on a Friday night (I know), every time I see one of these, Radcliffe's acting seems to get worse and worse!! AHH how dare you have so much money for being ****!!!
 
 
He's a rubbish actor and quite annoying in interviews. I also think he's a closet case and will come out when the Harry Potter film franchise is over. A gay can spot a gay.

How come? Not doubting your gay spotting abilities here, just want to know what it is that makes you think that

Repped.
 
 
He's like Robert Pattinson's nerdy,uglier brother.
He has an old man's face on a child's body.
The thought of him naked in that horse play is quite repulsive.

Oh and he's a crap actor.

This.

OP i used to when i was 12
 
 
i personally think he is really awkward to watch, and hes a rubbish actor in my humble opinion, however apparently he is must better at plays than movies.
 
 
I'm watching it too  
I don't think he's the best actor or anything, not really seen many interviews, but it would have been hard for anyone being shoved into such a massive franchise when he was 11 or something
 
 
Don't like him either. He was so promising in the first two films, then got progressively worse. Don't even get me started on Emma Watson- constant crying and whining >.< ?!
 
 
  he was really good in the first 2 movies
but in the latest ones i think all the acting and plots have been a bit naff here and there
  though i persist to watch them repeatedly anyway
 
 
Rob Pattison owns Daniel Radcliffe in the 5th movie.

Pity he got killed off...
 
 
He is the epitome of faggotry.

No.
 
 
Huh? his acting aint bad

Emma Watson's actings bad!!! i dont know if anyone else has realized this either, took me years just to realize this as well  
 
 
I'm watching it too, gotta love the films but he is a massive sac. I agree with you on the gay thing too.

You just get that vibe from him and he's very awkward when probed about girlfriends or girls in general during interviews. He also did an interview and a photo shoot for Attitude, where he expressed huge support for gay people. I'm not saying you have to be gay to support gays, but he was very switched on about LGBT issues and is extremely passionate about it. He's also affiliated with many LGBT groups. I may be completely wrong, but I think he's a fan of willies.
 
 
I dont think the films in general have anything on the books!!
 
 
Dan Rad is like Rpattz kinda crap actors but weirdly easy to watch

The first time I saw this I snot-laughed. When he screamed "HE WAS WAS THEIR FRIEND!" snot literally flew out of my nose at how hilariously awful the whole scene was.

Sorry, too much info...

Ah, it's tough for me to criticise Emma Watson's acting as I'm fairly certain I'm in love with her. She's the dream upper class girl who could slum it with me for a while haha...  
 
 
Emma Watson and Daniel Radcliffe, multi millionaires for bearing a resemblance to Harry Potter characters and acting like absolute ****. These two ruin these films I get angry about it every time I watch them.
 
 
hes cute, in a weird geeky harry potter way haha..

Haha her acting may be poor but i admit she is a very pretty lady  
 
 
Remember that the actors in the HP franchise were picked because they were cute and had pushy mothers. They were ten for heaven's sakes.

Emma W. has done well with her fashion and stuff, but I think he will fade into obscurity.
 
 
She is pretty, but why did Burberry use her for a campaign? Proof that there's more to modelling than being pretty, as those shots were epically bad.

Edit: And it seems she can't dress herself well without a stylist.
 
 
he really isn't a good actor

I don't think they're the worst actors in the films- although they are admittedly poor. It's the two guys who play Fred and George that really annoy me; now they were definitely picked merely because they were ginger twins and cannot act in the slightest.
 
 
He is a very rubbish actor but my friends don't believe me and he's ugly too
 
 
The word 'bland' comes to mind whenever his name is mentioned.

Fit as though. At what movie does it become acceptable though?

That sounds about true and really does explain a lot - LOL  
 
 
I think he's a bit akward and kind of geeky. Which I find quite appealing  
 
 
Emma is worse. I can't believe she earns so much money.

Her acting?

Never  

I watched the first 2 HP movies again and thought,'hang on a second this acting is really ******'   Now i cant take her seriously anymore  
 
 
Dont even get me started :  
 
 
PAHA! this question is like asking 'is the pope a catholic?'
of course noone likes him. he's a fool.
 
 
I want to sink my fist into his doughy unleavened face.
 
 
He's a filthy puffter.

Rupert is solid.
 
 
his acting is very wooden
 
 
Thought I'd switch to the Bourne Identity, now that's a film!
 
 
I really do think he's gay.

He has grown into a really strange looking individual. I think he looks a bit like Jared Leto. And his body proportions are just really strange!

Rupert is definitely the best actor of the three.  
 
 
He has the hairiest stomach I've ever seen on a man

It looks worse because it's dark hair on very light skin.

But then to go on to twilight...pity
i've only barely seen the first one and he looked constipated
 
 
Meh  
 
 
Bad actor I can agree with, but he's hardly a troll when it comes to appearance.

I don't think he's gay; I remember reading that interview and they asked point blank and he denied it. Surely if he's comfortable enough to represent gay charities he'd just admit it or at least give some vague answer like Wentworth Miller and others do.

Anyway, on the thread topic he seems fine in interviews and was very funny in Extras. I don't really know where the hate comes from.

Exactly! For his age, his acting was probably impressive in the Philospher's Stone but as for the other films,   Ah well, I'm a huge Harry Potter fan so I'll have to get over it  

Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are amazing though, imo.

So wrong but  
 
 
I watched the last half an hour or so of Goblet of Fire last night (I have seen it before, but not for a while) and I had forgotten how bad Daniel Radcliffe's acting was! His delivery of some of the lines was quite embarrassing. Ah well, I shall probably watch Order of the Phoenix tonight and cringe all the way through that, too.
 
 
He annoys me. He is on my personal hit list.

He's not a great actor but the actress who plays Hermione is worst. My 11 year old sister watching Harry Potter last night felt the need to say "Get some acting lessons Bitch". Lol.
 
 
No one likes him, I heard he was played a part in this, Harry Potter film or something...

"HE WAS THEIR FRIEND!"
Bad acting alert!  

Emma Watson's worse though.

  Elijah Wood is lovely   I used to like DR when the first films came out (I was in primary school in my defence!   ) but now he's just odd. I like him in the films though   He's still hot in the fourth film  
 
 
I really cannot stand him; I think his acting is very wooden. Nobody ever judges him though, because he's 'Harry Potter'.

They've actually got brown hair in real life  . I think they're ok.

Emma Watson and Rupert Grint are fantastic. Daniel Radcliffe is not as good, but I still think he's good, especially in the latest film. For some reason I still don't see him as Harry Potter when I read the books.
 
 
I can't stand Daniel Radcliffe. He puts too much effort into making every single sentence dramatic!
 
 
I've seen him in other drama's where he is actually quite good, but apparantly his acting style is just not fit to HP >.< I can't even watch those films anymore.

(Granted, Extras was great   )
 
 
Nah I like him, I like how he's very awkward and a bit odd but still quite excitable. I agree his delivery is often comical though, and the less said about Emma's eyebrows the better.
