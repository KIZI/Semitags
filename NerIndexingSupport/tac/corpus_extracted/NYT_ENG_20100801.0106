The Republican running for governor in Connecticut went to
Andover, Harvard and Harvard Business School, founded a private
equity firm and settled in Greenwich. He owns a private plane, six
cars and three motorcycles, as well as a 100-foot yacht registered
in the Marshall Islands.

His likely Democratic rival (Exeter, Harvard, Yale MBA) has a
net worth of more than $90 million, and owns six cars and a 16-room
home in Greenwich.

This is not information, of course, that viewers glean from TV
commercials.

There, the Republican, Thomas C. Foley, is the guy sliding into
the booth at a diner, wearing blue jeans and a neighborly look. The
Democrat, Ned Lamont, is the unassuming father who reminisces about
his early struggles starting a business.

Much has been said this election season about the number of rich
candidates tapping their fortunes to run for office. But with the
campaign taking place during a still-difficult economy, the wealth
of the candidates in Connecticut creates a bit of a challenge for
their advertising teams: How do you boil more than 55 years of
privilege and astounding affluence into 30 seconds of homespun
appeal?

Their approaches are strikingly similar: The candidates'
wardrobes are often casual Friday, if not weekend getaway. Their
biographies stress their self-starter business skills. And they
boast of being independent outsiders who can not only relate to the
common man, but also be the common man, at least on TV.

"I like making things better for people," Foley intones, as a
vintage color photograph of him as a boy with his five siblings
appears in one advertisement. "My dad used to joke that I was
always tinkering, busy trying to fix things."

Lamont, with aw-shucks earnestness worthy of Ned Flanders of
"The Simpsons," tells a gathering in one spot, "I'm going to
make darn sure that we get this state growing again."

Though both men face primary opponents, their wealth has allowed
them to dominate on television; they started running their
commercials months ago, while their opponents were still trying to
raise money to qualify for public financing, and together Foley and
Lamont have spent $2.7 million, or more than double their three
main rivals.

The visual cues that ad makers use to make candidates appear
more ordinary are familiar by now. Foley appears in a barn jacket
that echoes that the one worn by Scott Brown, the new Republican
senator from Massachusetts. The sleeves of Lamont's blue button
down are rolled up to the elbows.

"There's a little bit of 'I feel your pain' in a Bill Clinton
kind of way everywhere around the country now, and what you're
seeing is the Connecticut version of that," said Evan Tracey,
president of the Campaign Media Analysis Group, which tracks
political advertising. "They've got to find those ways to connect,
and a lot of them are nonverbal ways, like sitting down in a diner
or driving in a car. The test is when voters watch this do they
believe that this guy would really roll into the diner and have an
egg salad, or is he going to get his smoothie on the way to the
gym?"

Much could change in the days remaining before the Aug. 10
primaries, and sparring is now breaking out daily over debates
(Lamont had ducked them until recently) and checkered pasts (Foley
once spent a night in jail in the Hamptons).

Yet even when projecting a humble image in those ads, Foley and
Lamont do not run away their business successes. But they tailor it
to the times: stressing their experience in creating jobs and skill
at revitalizing struggling groups (read: Hartford). Foley stands in
an abandoned warehouse in one spot, wearing a V-neck sweater, and
says: "I know how to run a business. Let's get to work."

Foley is relying on the Stevens and Schriefer Group for his
commercials; it worked on the Bush-Cheney campaigns of 2000 and
2004, Mitt Romney's presidential run in 2008 and Chris Christie's
successful race for New Jersey governor last year. Lamont is using
the Campaign Group, which has helped Edward G. Rendell in the race
for Pennsylvania governor, Bill Richardson in his run to be the
governor of New Mexico and, last year, William C. Thompson Jr. in a
bid for mayor of New York City.

"Foley is a complete newcomer to the Connecticut political
scene, so he's really been able to define his image through his
campaign ads," said Douglas Schwartz, director of the Quinnipiac
University Poll. He noted that Foley began broadcasting commercials
last fall, when he considered running against Sen. Christopher J.
Dodd. Voters "know him better than they know Fedele, who has been
lieutenant governor."

For the 73 percent of Connecticut voters who, in Quinnipiac's
most recent poll, said they did not know enough about him, that
would be Lt. Gov. Michael C. Fedele, a Republican who has been the
second-in-command to Gov. M. Jodi Rell. She is not running for
re-election, and, in a blow to Fedele, she has not endorsed anyone.

Fedele's advertising has been limited, but in it, he describes
his working-class immigrant roots (he was born in Italy) and his
information technology company, stating that "starting from
nothing, I built a business and created hundreds of jobs."

He also, in a recent ad, tries to turn Foley's business record
against him, featuring residents of a Georgia factory town who said
that Foley bankrupted their business while he made off with $20
million in management fees.

A third Republican, Oz Griebel, a businessman from the Hartford
area, has not advertised widely.

Foley, 58, is the chairman of the NTC Group, which restructures
struggling companies. A major Republican donor and friend of former
President George W. Bush, he served briefly as a top official with
the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq, and more recently as
ambassador to Ireland. (He spent $500,000 of his own money sprucing
up the ambassador's mansion when he was there.) Reporters have also
noted that Foley's yacht is named Odalisque, a Turkish term for a
female slave in a harem.

Lamont, best known for his unsuccessful bid to oust Sen. Joseph
I. Lieberman in 2006, is a great-grandson of the chief executive
for the financier J.P. Morgan and started his own
telecommunications company. His wife is a successful venture
capitalist. Lamont's message to small business owners is simple:
I've been there.

"I remember starting up my own business," he says in one
commercial. "We borrowed some money, rented a small cubicle. It
wasn't easy, but we made it."

His opponent, Dannel P. Malloy, is a former mayor of Stamford
and a former Brooklyn prosecutor. Malloy, who has been gaining in
recent polls, uses the street he grew up on in Stamford as a
backdrop in three commercials, and he emphasizes that he has the
"experience money can't buy."

"As governor, I'll never forget where I came from," he says.
