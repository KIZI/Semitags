Seeking her third grand slam victory of the year, Serena Williams withstood a strong test from Maria Jose Martinez Sanchez of Spain 6-3, 7-5 to advance to the fourth round of the U.S. Open on Friday.

It was an awkward match in Arthur Ashe Stadium for defending champion Williams, full of counterpunches from the game's biggest power hitter.

"I heard a guy in the crowd saying, `Stop hitting lobs,' so I didn't hit any more lobs after that," Williams said. "My lob was not working today."

Receiving at 5-all in the first set, Williams chipped back serves, made a few passing shots and found herself at deuce for the eighth time in a game that lasted 12 minutes. Martinez Sanchez finally wore out, double-faulting twice in a row to give up the break and, essentially, the match.

This has been a topsy-turvy U.S. Open for the women: No. 8 Victoria Azarenka's 4-6, 6-2, 6-2 loss to No. 26 Francesca Schiavone came a day after No. 4 Elena Dementieva and No. 5 Jelena Jankovic were upset. All told, 11 of the 20 highest-seeded women are gone, and the third round is only halfway done.

"Now there is not a lot of difference between players," Sanchez Martinez said. "I think anyone can win any match."

No. 3 Venus Williams, the 2000-01 Open champion, avoided adding to the list of stunning results when she got past 46th-ranked Magdalena Rybarikova of Slovakia 6-2, 7-5. Next up for the elder Williams: A fourth-round match against Kim Clijsters, who recently came out of retirement and is playing in the tournament for the first time since winning it in 2005.

"She was a great champion," Venus Williams said. "She still is."

Other winners included No. 7 Vera Zvonareva of Russia, No. 10 Flavia Pennetta of Italy, No. 18 Li Na of China and No. 26 Francesca Schiavone of Italy.

The best men have faced no such problems.

Friday's winners included No. 2 Andy Murray, No. 6 Juan Martin del Potro, No. 7 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and No. 9 Gilles Simon. None of the top 10 men had dropped a single set -- much less lost -- until 2008 runner-up Murray's little slip in his 6-2, 3-6, 6-0, 6-2 win over 87th-ranked Paul Capdeville of Chile.

Also winners were No. 16 Marin Cilic of Croatia, from two sets down against American Jesse Levine, No. 17 Tomas Berdych of the Czech Republic and No. 24 Juan Carlos Ferrero of Spain.

Heading into No. 3 Rafael Nadal's match against Nicolas Kiefer late Friday, the top 16 men were 15-0 in the second round. According to the International Tennis Federation, never in the 41-year Open era have the men seeded 1-16 all advanced to the third round at any Grand Slam tournament.

"There is a gap," said Jurgen Melzer of Austria, who lost to del Potro 7-6 (6), 6-3, 6-3.

Williams and Martinez Sanchez were meeting for the first time since the French Open third round, when Williams won in three sets. After that match, Williams said she hit a ball she thought went off her opponent's arm, and accused Martinez Sanchez of cheating by not acknowledging it.

There was no sign of animosity on Friday, however, and Sanchez Martinez said: "We are players, and we see each other every week, and we have to have a good relation."

Williams, who came to her news conference wearing a T-shirt that said "Can't spell dynasty without nasty," lost only seven games in her first two matches. She doubled that total on Friday in the kind of match that very few have to play on the women's -- or men's -- circuit these days. Serve-and-volley is out, power groundstrokes are in.

"Every time I play, I say, `I'm going to be a serve-and-volleyer," Williams said. "I even used to like Martina Navratilova and John McEnroe. But I couldn't play more opposite than them. I love groundstrokes, I love rallies, I love hitting the ball."

Williams, bidding for her fourth U.S. Open title, next meets 22nd-seeded Daniela Hantuchova, who defeated American Vania King 6-2, 6-2.
