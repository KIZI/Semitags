On Sept. 12, an Associated Press article inside The Times
reported that the Census Bureau had severed its ties to ACORN, the
community organizing group. Robert Groves, the census director, was
quoted as saying that ACORN, one of thousands of unpaid
organizations promoting the 2010 census, had become "a
distraction."

What the article didn't say -- but what followers of Fox News and
conservative commentators already knew -- was that a video sting had
caught ACORN workers counseling a bogus prostitute and pimp on how
to set up a brothel staffed by under-age girls, avoid detection and
cheat on taxes. The young woman in streetwalker's clothes and her
companion were actually undercover conservative activists with a
hidden camera.

It was an intriguing story: employees of a controversial outfit,
long criticized by Republicans as corrupt, appearing to engage in
outrageous, if not illegal, behavior. An ACORN worker in Baltimore
was shown telling the "prostitute" that she could describe
herself to tax authorities as an "independent artist" and claim
15-year-old prostitutes, supposedly illegal immigrants, as
dependents.

But for days, as more videos were posted and government
authorities rushed to distance themselves from ACORN, The Times
stood still. Its slow reflexes -- closely following its slow
response to a controversy that forced the resignation of Van Jones,
a White House adviser -- suggested that it has trouble dealing with
stories arising from the polemical world of talk radio, cable
television and partisan blogs. Some stories, lacking facts, never
catch fire. But others do, and a newspaper like The Times needs to
be alert to them or wind up looking clueless or, worse, partisan
itself.

Some editors told me they were not immediately aware of the
ACORN videos on Fox, YouTube and a new conservative Web site called
BigGovernment.com. When the Senate voted to cut off all federal
funds to ACORN, there was not a word in the newspaper or on its Web
site. When the New York City Council froze all its funding for
ACORN and the Brooklyn district attorney opened a criminal
investigation, there was still nothing.

Readers noticed. James Jeff Crocket of New Britain, Conn., spoke
for many when he said he was sure he knew why the paper was silent:
"protecting the progressive movement."

Finally, on Sept. 16, nearly a week after the first video was
posted, The Times took note of the controversy, under the headline,
"Conservatives Draw Blood From ACORN, Favored Foe." The article
said that conservatives hoped to weaken the Obama administration by
attacking its allies and appointees they viewed as leftist. The
conservatives thought they had a "winning formula," the article
said, mobilizing people "to dig up dirt," then trumpeting it on
talk radio and television.

By stressing the politics, the article irritated more readers.
"A suspicious person might see an attempt to deflect criticism of
ACORN by highlighting how those pesky conservatives are at it
again," said Albert Smith of Chatham, N.J.

I thought politics was emphasized too much, at the expense of
questions about an organization whose employees in city after city
participated in outlandish conversations about illegal and immoral
activities. (ACORN suggested some videos were doctored but fired or
suspended many of the employees.)

The Times quoted a statement by Bertha Lewis, ACORN's chief
executive, saying that the two activists, James O'Keefe, 25, and
Hannah Giles, 20, spent months visiting ACORN offices in San Diego,
Los Angeles, Miami and Philadelphia before getting the responses
they wanted. But the article left out one city Lewis cited: New
York. Between the time of her statement and the publication of the
article, a new video surfaced, featuring an ACORN worker in
Brooklyn advising Giles to bury money from prostitution in a tin.

Some readers saw a deliberate effort by the paper to help Lewis
out of a tight spot. Scott Shane, the reporter, said he had been
unable to reach Lewis and felt that including New York among the
cities she mentioned would have implied unfairly that she was
lying, something for which he had no evidence. He said he thought
it was unlikely that employees in New York would inform her of
their misconduct before the video appeared. I think he should have
included New York. One persistent complaint about ACORN is that it
fails to manage its staff. Lewis' statement was removed from
ACORN's Web site after a video was posted with an ACORN worker from
San Diego suggesting how to smuggle girls across the border.

Shane said he thought it was correct to approach the ACORN sting
as a political story. Absent that aspect, he said, the discussion
of prostitution by low-level employees was not compelling news.

Some conservatives think O'Keefe and Giles were doing work that
should have been done by the mainstream media. But most news
organizations consider such tactics unethical -- The Times
specifically prohibits reporters from misrepresenting themselves or
making secret recordings. And the two were sloppy with facts. One
ACORN employee who bragged about killing one of her former husbands
said she knew she was being scammed and was playing along. The
police said they found her ex-husbands alive.

Dean Baquet, the Washington bureau chief, said, "We did not
ignore the ACORN story, so I don't think it's fair for people to
say we blew it off." The paper's follow-up coverage has included a
profile of O'Keefe, a report on a House vote to deny funds to
ACORN, and an article on the Internal Revenue Service's decision to
drop ACORN from its volunteer tax assistance program. Baquet said
people need to keep ACORN in perspective with other Washington
stories: health care, two wars and the deep recession.

Jill Abramson, the managing editor for news, agreed with me that
the paper was "slow off the mark," and blamed "insufficient
tuned-in-ness to the issues that are dominating Fox News and talk
radio." She and Bill Keller, the executive editor, said last week
that they would now assign an editor to monitor opinion media and
brief them frequently on bubbling controversies. Keller declined to
identify the editor, saying he wanted to spare that person "a
bombardment of e-mails and excoriation in the blogosphere."

Despite what the critics think, Abramson said the problem was
not liberal bias.

Tom Rosenstiel, the director of the Pew Project for Excellence
in Journalism, said he has studied journalists for years, and
though they are more liberal than the general population, he
believes they are motivated by the desire to get good stories, not
to help one particular side. Conservatives who believe The Times
isn't critical of Democrats forget that the paper broke damaging
stories about the personal finances of Rep. Charles Rangel and the
hiring of prostitutes by Eliot Spitzer.

But Rosenstiel said The Times has a particular problem with
conservatives, especially after its article last year suggesting
that John McCain had an extramarital affair. And Republicans
earlier this year charged that the paper killed a story about ACORN
that would have been a "game changer" in the presidential
election -- a claim I found to be false.

"If you know you are a target, it requires extra vigilance,"
Rosenstiel said. "Even the suspicion of a bias is a problem all by
itself."
