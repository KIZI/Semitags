I woke up in the middle of the night with my bed shaking, like Exorcist shaking. But my dog (in the bed) didn't wake up and neither did my husband, and the rest of the house wasn't shaking.

So I just figured it was all in my head. Or else it was demons.  
 
 
Did you attempt to awaken your husband and ask, "What's that?"

stay off the cheese late at night
it attracts delusional poltergeists
 
 
 
Nudge nudge wink wink.
Is you wife a "goer?"
 
 
My husband was in another room. He snores. The dog though is very jumpy and I have no doubt he'd have freaked out if something had actually been happening in real life. So I just went back to sleep.

Actually it could have been the cheese...

PS: C Felix, I am the wife.

Are you sure it wasn't an earthquake? I've been in a few that felt exactly like that.
 
 
When that's happened to me - it's because my cat was having an epileptic seizure. She shakes and the whole bed shakes.

Probably not applicable to your case.
 
 
Too much AC/DC on the iPod?
 
 
Once, when I was a stereotypically surly teenager, I was awakened at the crack of noon by someone shaking my bed, just as you described. When I opened my eyes and didn't see anyone in my room, I flew into a righteous teenage rage, bolted through the door and swore loudly at everyone in the house for disturbing me.

Everyone was sitting around the TV, watching a breaking news report about the moderate earthquake that had just hit, and laughing really hard at my stupid self.

The Monty Python thread is  that way .  
 
 
Is there a possibility that you dreamt that the bed was shaking?
Perhaps you were not awake, but dreamt that you were?

I have had an experience where I thought my dad was in the room, and that I was talking to him, but I was sleeping the whole time. I thought I was awake though.

This.

When I was just out of high school, my father helped me get hired, literally, at the salt "mines" where he worked. I was the lowest man on the totem, working on the salt-bagging lines, stacking salt on pallets so that they could be shipped. I was hired onto a 10 hour shift, and because the production plant was behind, we worked six or seven days a week. I have never worked so hard and so long in my life. I even dreamed of "throwing salt" when I was asleep. My pillow happened to be about the same size as a 50lb bag of salt, which was the most common variety. I woke up a number of times believing that I had been throwing salt, and that my pillow was a bag that hadn't been sewn properly. I would toss it aside and yell, "Sew 'em up!" I would then think for some reasons the lights were out in the production plant, and it was insane for them to make us work in the dark.

The moral of the story is that if you want your son to get a college degree and a career at a desk, have them work in the salt mines for a summer.

I think if it was an earthquake my husband and/or dog would have alerted to it. I have slept through them in the past while they have woken up. In those cases the whole house was swaying; in this case it was just my bed.

I don't believe for a second it was anything supernatural. Just seemed really real. I can see why someone would believe in this stuff and I have hallucinated in the past (prescription drug induced).

It's easy enough to check; there are a number of sites (starting with the USGS) that will list all the recent earthquakes for an area.

Small, nearby earthquakes feel very different from larger, more distant quakes. In two quakes that I can remember, my initial assumption was that something large had hit the roof, and I've had small quakes that I'd initially interpreted as someone shaking the bed. The first time this happened, it was only when I bumped into my roommate in the hall that we both realized it was a quake.

That being said, I'd guess that the "just a dream" theory is more likely correct.

I do something similar when playing Call of Duty on the XBOX, only with me its sleep hand grenade throwing, I once woke up still in the dream and threw myself aside to avoid the blast,

my girl always talks in her sleep, she once shouted out "chocolate log fingers", isn't that always the way though, the men dream of glory in war and the women dream of huge amounts of chocolate
 
 
 
Same thing happened to me a couple years ago, and I asked the forum. Nothing.

It was suggested that my partner was maybe pleasuring himself, but I know for a fact that wasn't the case. It would have woken me up, and the bed would have been shaking a long time. He takes forever.

So I've just chalked it up to one of life's little mysteries.
 
 
My guess is it's nothing more mysterious than a hypnopompic hallucination, which isn't anything very special or rare.
 
 
My brother once jumped out of bed and stood, legs spread, with his hands on the wardrobe shouting "Get outa the way! Get outa the way!". Later, he explained that he was dreaming that a huge lorry had crashed into the house and he was holding it back to prevent everybody being crushed.

Compus
 
 
<sigh> I once dreamed that there was a spider riding down a thread that was hanging from the overhead light fixture. I jumped out of bed to get away from it, but (still half-dreaming) I thought that the thread had caught on my shoulder. So I ran, figuring that the thread would simply break before the spider got to me. I had worked up quite a head of steam by the time I hit the coffee table, breaking two toes and giving myself some dreadful rugburns.

Was it in one of those hotels with the box you put money in and it makes the bed shake? But seriously, I've seen an apparition and whatever they are, they do seem to be able to move stuff around.

Yeah... I don't buy it. Unless you have better (any) evidence, I can believe you imagined you saw an apparition that moved stuff around.

Hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations I think explain most if not all of these phenomena.

I don't expect you would believe any of it anyway and I don't have any evidence. You would had to have been there yourself. I will say however that when I saw it, I was wide awake during the day and had been for several hours. I was practising my guitar and caught it out of the corner of my eye off to the right. It then drifted across the room in front of me into the kitchen area and out through a closed door. It was three dimensional and maintained a humanoid shape but was indistinct, like the old beam-in effects from Star Trek TOS, but not completely materialized. It scared me a lot. The room was where me and my first band used to practise and I never went back there alone. I brought it up with the other guys and they said they had also experienced weird, but less dramatic things too. There's more to this story as well... but I'm not going to go into it here.

Don't tell me about spiders... they are about the only dream thing that's ever really freaked me out. I don't like killing them so I catch them and release them outside. But one time I vacuumed one up into our shop vac and I couldn't help think that it was in there growing bigger and creating a massive nest that would suddenly burst out all over me the next time I emptied the container... or if it didn't do that it might come creeping back out the hose seeking revenge.
 
 
It's also possible that you had one of those lovely "jerks" that you body will sometimes do as you are falling asleep and/or changing phases of sleep. (I don't know if they occur when awakening.) I think they're called "hypnic jerks" and are a subset of myoclonus...all of which is medspeak for, "those muscle jerks you get when you're asleep or falling asleep".

I don't know about you, but when I have one I sometimes hit the bed with an audible thump. (Often while having a micro-dream about tripping or falling, ugh.) My husband occasionally will twitch hard enough to wake me up; in either case, the bed would shake a bit afterward. So in addition to just dreaming the bed was shaking, you might actually have both dreamed of the bed shaking AND made it shake a bit as you were waking up or falling back asleep after one of the momentary wakenings we all have in normal sleep.

Nothing to worry about unless it happens routinely!

The thing is, you have no reason to dismiss misperception or hallucination either. Same goes for your levitation in bed stories.

Wrong. I have reasons to dismiss hallucinations and misperceptions. Those reasons just aren't good enough for you not to dismiss them. But since you weren't there, it's easy for you to be dismissive. It's the same old wrangle. I haven't experienced anything weirder than the occasional weird dream for many years now.
 
 
ufology -- I can think of several non-supernatural explanations for seeing a vague, human-ish shape drifting across the room. I've even experienced several of them.

1) Hallucination. These are much more common than people realize, it's just that we often hallucinate 'normal' things. That is, if you hallucinate a bird flitting by and you are outside, unless you comment on it and someone else is beside you, you'll never know you had it. Auditory hallucinations, particularly of someone saying your name, are also quite common.

2) You had a visual 'floater' from material inside your eye. Don't get grossed out, but your eye is basically a bag of jelly with stuff floating around in it--it's not like you have empty space between your lens and your retina. Sometimes we have things move into the area illuminated by the opened iris, and we see them. The most common things are wormlike or sort of ovoid, but again, it's an indistinct shape and has apparent movement. Usually blinking vigorously and rolling your eyes around will cause them to disappear again.

3) Migraine aura. I'm assuming if you experience migraine you'd have mentioned it, but I have seem some seriously weird stuff in the prodromal period. I get moving flashes, crescents of light, moving fortifications (black lines overlapped and meshed) and sometimes just Holes In The Universe. Once in a while, I will get the aura without the headache, but that is rare.

4) Micro nap and dream. Just because you've been awake for hours doesn't mean you can't drop off for a few moments, especially if you're fairly physically still--as can happen if you're curled around a guitar working on, say, a fingerpick. Doing a repetitive task can also put the brain into readiness to drift off into a dreaming state.

5) Not to put too fine a point on it, were you in the state of mind a lot of musicians use? Lots of creative people use chemical enhancements, and those can have unexpected impacts on the senses and/or the mind.

I have no stones to throw on the seeing of strange things: I once 'saw' a hellhound jump over my back fence, and for many years I absolutely believed it was real. Then I discovered what a hypnogogic hallucination was (or perhaps hypnopompic, it was in the middle of the night) and that gave me a much more likely explanation. Sure, it's theoretically possible that there really was a hellhound in the yard, and that I then went back to sleep anyway; that there are such things but they've never been documented and manage to somehow exist even though their metaphysical status is questionable...but the likelier explanation, by far, is that I had a fantastic experience that FELT real but was not.

Just my thoughts, MK

I'm not phobic about spiders; I can't remember ever being particularly frightened by a spider in a dream or, for that matter, in real life. I just didn't want that one landing on me. In retrospect, the fact that it wasn't real makes it even less threatening.

Thanks for all that there. I appreciate you taking the time to offer some points to consider. Perhaps I'll mention that I'm now over 50 and I've had an interest in this stuff for a long time, so I'm aware of most of the things you mention. There are certain things that are easy to write off as an illusion or misperception and when I'm able to apply the kind of thinking you suggest, then I do. But in the instance where I observed this thing, whatever it was, I wasn't seeing things. I was young with perfect vision and in perfect health, wide awake, and I had never even tried drugs. I watched it for several seconds. Now that being said, I suppose maybe some kind of musically induced hypnotic state may have spontaneously arisen leading me to temporarily visualize this thing... but you'll have to forgive me for being skeptical about that. I've been playing for a long time and nothing like that has happened before or since. Then add to it all the other weird stuff that I haven't mentioned so far and well... something really strange was going on there. The only thing that would explain it sufficiently for me is a well planned illusion done on purpose without my ( our ) knowledge. But that really doesn't seem all that likely either. It was a small town and we had no resident magician with that kind of talent and/or technology lurking around waiting to scare unsuspecting teen agers. Lastly, I'm not a believer in the supernatural. I think that whatever these things are there is an explanation that would be rational and scientifically explainable if we only had sufficient information, knowledge and technology.

No, just aliens, talking rabbits, levitation, MiBs in hover cars, and human apparitions... but nothing supernatural.

You're just setting us up for the February '12 edition of SFM, right? Or maybe the 2011 Best of Squid Fishing Monthly? There are a lot of separate articles there.

UFOlogy, I love the matter-of-fact way you introduce your woo. There I was reading through a thread, not noting the posters and I read the beginning of a post only to encounter,... "But seriously, I've seen an apparition..."

I truly think only you would post that sentence. How does one take that comment seriously. "But seriously, I've had hangnails and they be troublesome..."

William of Ockham says, "Don't be silly now."
 
 
My ex-wife used to have hypnogogic hallucinations of very large (dinner-plate sized) spiders on the walls once every couple of months or so. The hallucinations would usually persist well after she became ambulatory and seemingly lucid. She would usually yelp, jerk awake, and be able to jump out of bed and either get me out of the next room, or shake me awake in order to kill the "spider". Often, even after tens of seconds, enough time to wake/find me and explain that this time it was really there, she would "see" it, point to it, and then have it fade out.
First couple of times it was creepy, but we both got so used to it that it was a running joke. But she would still see it after being awake enough to make eye contact and lucidly explain what she was looking at.

You were in a band? Weren't you listening to Led Zeppelin in the 1970's? I really want to take your word with the "no drugs" thing, but... colour me sceptical.

If you're in a band long enough, especially back then, you're going to see some weird ****. It comes with the territory.

The sort of vision you saw doesn't require a magician, or any special technology. Just the usual routine. I saw similar stuff. Shadowy apparition walking through the house in the middle of the day. On the road, on a long haul between gigs it seemed that the vehicle was being "beamed" by orange lights from an unseen flying saucer, like Richard Dreyfuss in "Close Encounters" etc, etc. Was always "wide awake". It wasn't flying saucers and it wasn't ghosts.

Regarding the OP's bed shaking thing. That happened to me also. Except one end of the bed lifted about a foot or 2 and dropped, like someone lifting it and letting go. Had only just sat on it when it happened. Dunno what that was about. But, it was back in the day also and I'm pretty sure it wasn't a poltergeist.

Clearly a hallucination. Probably sleep related.

You say you have been researching hallucinations. I can't believe that you don't connect this with a typical sleep hallucination, probably combined with paralysis. A shadowy object in the periphery of your vision, inability to investigate it because you are sleeping, attributing it to the supernatural, because you are unwilling to accept that your brain was flawed, and therefore you couldn't have hallucinated. Typical.

Our friend has suffered from a number of probable sleep-related hallucinations from OMGaliens to giant rabbits yet refuses to recognize their possiblity. Or that his memory could possibly be flawed.

You were wide awake right up until the moment when you became drowsy and began to fell asleep. Happens all the time. Happens to me. Even when playing the guitar. In fact expecially when concentrating intensely on something like a playing a musical instrument for quite awhile.

Kind of like sitting up "all night" listening to Led Zeppelin.
 
 
I would liken it to those hallucinations that drivers have.
They are concentrating fully on driving, yet at some point they start falling asleep, without knowing it, and they 'see' something unusual shoot on the road.

I would also direct you to a thing called 'Automatic Behavior'
Something as simple as strumming a guitar might fall under this category.
You may have been falling asleep, strumming your guitar, if someone talked to you, at that time, you might have attempted to talk back to them, it probably would have been mumbled by you, but you would have thought you were talking to them coherently. At this time a hallucination developed, and you 'Saw' this thing walk across your field of view.

You may have woken up, still strumming the guitar, and thought 'I wasn't asleep, I'm still strumming'

I have fallen asleep during lectures, with a pen in hand, in contact with the paper, and when I woke up there was all kinds of incoherent scribbles on the paper. I was writing on the paper, and fully asleep.

Hypnosis and trance states

The mystic achieves hallucinations by gaining control of his own dissociative mechanisms; perhaps this is a form of self-hypnosis. Such individuals can accomplish an astonishing withdrawal from the environment by prolonged intense concentration (e.g., by gazing at some object). The hallucinations may be of the type in which the person perceives his inner self to leave his body to view himself (autoscopic hallucination) or to be transported to new surroundings. Alternatively, the hallucinations may take the form of unique visual imagery; for example, the yantra is a visual hallucination of a coloured, geometrical image that appears at a level of trance of the sort experienced by practitioners of Yoga.

I used to have those "half" dreams all the time, where I wake up, feel a presence in the room, feel someone sit down on the bed behind me (and of course I cannot turn over to see). I've had them so often that I pretty much ignore them now. Hallucinations all.

When our dog suddenly gets out of bed and begins sniffing around the house, we say "oh he must have seen a ghost." For some reason the ghost is always in or near the kitchen.  
 
 
 
Miss_Kitt

Thanks for all that there. I appreciate you taking the time to offer some points to consider. Perhaps I'll mention that I'm now over 50 and I've had an interest in this stuff for a long time, so I'm aware of most of the things you mention. There are certain things that are easy to write off as an illusion or misperception and when I'm able to apply the kind of thinking you suggest, then I do. But in the instance where I observed this thing, whatever it was, I wasn't seeing things. I was young with perfect vision and in perfect health, wide awake, and I had never even tried drugs. I watched it for several seconds. Now that being said, I suppose maybe some kind of musically induced hypnotic state may have spontaneously arisen leading me to temporarily visualize this thing... but you'll have to forgive me for being skeptical about that. I've been playing for a long time and nothing like that has happened before or since. Then add to it all the other weird stuff that I haven't mentioned so far and well... something really strange was going on there. The only thing that would explain it sufficiently for me is a well planned illusion done on purpose without my ( our ) knowledge. But that really doesn't seem all that likely either. It was a small town and we had no resident magician with that kind of talent and/or technology lurking around waiting to scare unsuspecting teen agers. Lastly, I'm not a believer in the supernatural. I think that whatever these things are there is an explanation that would be rational and scientifically explainable if we only had sufficient information, knowledge and technology.

 
I remember at around nine years of age being in a small boat on a billabong (oxbow lake) fishing for barramundi (awesome Aussie fish) with my dad and possibly another of his friends. As dusk was approaching I saw an unknown figure dressed in all white on the bank do something very odd. He appeared to impossibly walk over the top of a vehicle and then walk onto the water, ala Jesus, for a short distance before returning to shore.

I remember being very shocked at what I saw and looking to my dad, who was suprisingly completely unperturbed. I said nothing about what appeared to me to have been an extraordinary scene but perhaps inquired who the figure may have been. I never spoke to him about what I saw afterwards but related it to friends.

I may have been a witness to sorcery, a divine apparition, a visitor from outer space, a ghost or demons, as suggested in the OP. Or I may have had some kind of hallucination or misperception. Do I chose from a smorgasbord of things not demonstrated to exist, yet fitting the myths of my culture and upbringing, or phenomena well demonstrated through repeated rigorous scientific experimentation, namely the various ways in which human perception, memory and cognition can fail us? I give a damn about the truth so I choose the latter.

I alluded to such a possibility, and at least your answer proposes something plausible and rational. I respect that even if I don't personally believe that is what happened. One thing I theorized is that it might have been an intentional hoax on me. Because I was in a basement setting with dimmed lights and there was a ground level window directly behind and above where I had been standing, someone might have been able to project some kind of image through that window. I also tried some variations on that idea, like some completely random and rare combination of reflections, possibly from passing cars onto the windows of the surrounding buildings and back down through the window behind me that gave an illusion of some freaky movement. It's just that I can't honestly convince myself that that is what I saw. I know what those things look like. I'd seen them plenty of times as a kid while laying in bed at night as cars would drive down the alley behind our house, their lights causing moving bands of light and shadows across the walls of my room. At least I presumed they were cars... most of the time I could hear the gravel in the alley crunching under their tires and the sound of the engine. A few times I didn't hear any sounds though and I thought it was pretty strange, but figured they must have just been really quiet cars (... flashback... I wonder if those silent cars had anything to do with my weird OOBEs?... now I'm spooking myself again. ) Anyway, I'd also been to Disney's Haunted House and seen the ghost illusions. But you still know those are illusions. By comparison, this thing was just too real. What it was exactly I don't know, but I can see how these incidents could give rise to and reinforce beliefs in an afterlife and all the rest of that stuff.

So what you've done is to take the most unlikely possibility and unsurprisingly, managed to convince yourself it's rather unpossible.

Great work.
 
 
Should we pretend to not notice that ufology's post is now different to the one we responded to because he went back and edited it after we'd done so?
 
 
I was once reading in bed when I heard a very loud thump from above. It sounded as if someone in the attic had dropped a bowling ball. Though the house I was renting had a tall roof, there was no access to the attic anywhere.
I looked around the house and saw nothing. My cat was still sleeping on the bed. I looked around outside and could see no sign of anything heavy having hit the house.

Based on the evidence that my cat had not woken up, I could only conclude I must have had a microdream.
 
 
 
(... flashback... I wonder if those silent cars had anything to do with my weird OOBEs?... now I'm spooking myself again. ).

 
That's a big part of it, don't you think?
 
 
 
I have fallen asleep during lectures, with a pen in hand, in contact with the paper, and when I woke up there was all kinds of incoherent scribbles on the paper. I was writing on the paper, and fully asleep.

 
People text in their sleep too. Not mumbo jumbo but coherent sentences. Well, as coherent as txt spk cn b.  
 
 
 
I alluded to such a possibility, and at least your answer proposes something plausible and rational.

 
I'd just like to add that you'll find that all of Miss Kitt's suggestions in her very informative post are also plausible and rational.

Why would someone take all that time and effort to do something like that to you, ufology?

This seems to have got to anecdote time; so here goes.

Fairly frequently I will hear a scratching at my bedroom door, so will get up to let the dog in. But there is nothing there; I look back and the dogs are already curled up or stretched out on my bed. Occasionally one will raise an eyelid as if to say 'what are you doing?'.

I will sometimes sleep in a certain way that puts my arm to sleep. (I expect there is a proper medical term for that). I will wake up thinking 'What the heck is that?' and try to throw it away before I realize it is attached to me.

My father came into my room for a chat recently. We had a lovely conversation, although I don't recall what we spoke about. The problem is, he died twenty years ago.

The sleeping/dreaming/waking process is quite complex.

My mother appeared in a dream to tell me that John Denver had died (he was her favorite artist). It wasn't until the next morning that I heard on the news that he had been killed in a plane crash. That one raised a few hairs on the back of my neck.

I would occasionally wake up with my arm completely asleep. Once I got to wondering whether the muscles were still working, so I twitched my bicep just as an experiment. And punched myself in the face, splitting my lip.

Of course, my upper arm wasn't asleep, so there wouldn't have been any question about whether my bicep was working.

I had a dream wherein I was sitting at the table, chatting with my father. But in the dream, I remembered that he'd died a few months earlier. And as I considered him further, it was obvious that he was in his 40s (he died at 79), so this couldn't possibly be happening. I was trying to figure it out - was it an hallucination? Had I unknowingly taken some drug? I was completely baffled. It never occurred to me that I was dreaming.

I did that once, too-ouch!

Right after I became an atheist, God spoke to me.   I was in bed, and suddenly outside my window was lit up like it was daytime. I looked out, clearly seeing my yard in the daylight, and heard this booming voice (though I have no recollection of what he said). Then suddenly, it was over-cause I woke up! Spooked me bad, my early days of deconversion were full of doubt-but once I thought about it rationally, I realized it was a dream (the curtains and shade on the window were drawn, so I could not have seen out the window, and without my contacts in, no way could I see anything clearly).

I also have an auditory hallucination that happens sometimes when I lay a certain way on my pillow. It sounds like a radio is playing-sometimes music, sometimes talk radio. It was so loud once that I thought my son was playing his radio, and I got up to tell him to turn it down-the music instantly disappeared. Again, just one of those weird things.

How can a sleep related hallucination affect someone who has been wide awake for hours and is in the middle of concentrating on something that requires considerable conscious attention and concentration? Please provide references.

 
Very easily. It is incredibly common for those who are driving to fall into "micro sleeps" for a few seconds at a time and not realise.

Or to suffer sleep relateds symptoms from a LACK of sleep.

But it need not be sleep related. If you are concentrating on something that requires you to stare at a set point (like driving where you are looking ahead all the time) with key features that don't change (like a horizon,or long straight freeway) you will hallucinate.

My reference for this is a practical experiment you should carry out today with a large group of friends or colleagues. Tell a small control group to stand in front of a mirror, alone in a bathroom, close their eyes and repeat the phrase "Sweeney Sweeney Monsoon" thirteen times, then open their eyes. Very few will report seeing anything.

Now get the test group to go alone to a bathroom and stare themseles in the eyes as they repeat the phrase the thirteen times. Because they are concentrating on a set point for a set time, some portion will report that their reflection seemed to change.

This should have been an early discovery in any serious research into hallucinations and their causes.

Highway hypnosis happens when there's not a lot to concentrate on but a long repetition of the same visual cues while sitting doing next to nothing in a warm comfy seat usually when you're tired. In my case I was standing playing an electric guitar and practicing precision finger positioning and riffs. If you've ever learned guitar you know there's a certain amount of pain involved and it's not something you can do in your sleep.

Also I wasn't looking directly at it when it caught my attention. It was in my peripheral vision and when I stopped playing and looked at it, it started to move across the room. My eyes followed it for several seconds. This was not a hallucination... however like I said it may have been some kind of illusion. I just can't honestly convince myself of that because my mind says "I know what I saw and it was real and it wasn't my imagination". So basically, if I've tried to accept that it was probably an illusion, but I really don't think it was, then I'm not going to be dishonest with myself about it, and there really isn't anything else to be said. I don't know what it was and I'm not claiming it was some spirit of the departed. But it was there.
 
 
 
The only thing that would explain it sufficiently for me is a well planned illusion done on purpose without my ( our ) knowledge. But that really doesn't seem all that likely either.

So tell me, ufology, was there any billowing black smoke involved in this conjuring trick?
 
 
 
My husband was in another room. He snores. The dog though is very jumpy and I have no doubt he'd have freaked out if something had actually been happening in real life. So I just went back to sleep.

Actually it could have been the cheese...

PS: C Felix, I am the wife.  

 
Jumping in here.

The idea that the bed is rocking or shaking can come as an illusion due to tiredness or other things that disturbs your sense of balance (e.g. alcohol). Usually, if you sit up the illusion stops.

I once exprienced a pal (in the military) holding on to his bed for dear life, calling for us to stop rocking it. We weren't even touching it. (Here, the cause was indeed alcohol   ).

Based on the evidence that my cat had not woken up, I could only conclude I must have had a microdream.

 
Or, the house made a noise. Houses, both old and new, shift, creak, or crack at times. I have worked in a house (night guard) which, when it cooled in the evening, made two or three loud bangs, as loud as a pistol shot. Really freaked people out the first few times they heard it.

If you look at the roof beams in an old house, you will notice that they have large cracks. Some of these open gradually, but others open suddenly and that will be heard.

It happens to me in work meetings. I fall asleep for a few seconds with my eyes wide open because I’ve been concentrating hard.

 
In my case I was standing playing an electric guitar and practicing precision finger positioning and riffs. If you've ever learned guitar you know there's a certain amount of pain involved and it's not something you can do in your sleep.

 
I can assure you there’s a certain amount of pain involved in sitting in boring work meetings too.

 
Also I wasn't looking directly at it when it caught my attention. It was in my peripheral vision and when I stopped playing and looked at it, it started to move across the room. My eyes followed it for several seconds. This was not a hallucination...

 
Like being fooled by a cloud, you have no way of knowing this. It is the nature of an hallucination that you don’t know when you’re having one. If there is no-one else in the room to verify whether or not the object is there, as was the case with your incident, then you can never know whether you were hallucinating or not. It’s the nature of being fooled that you don’t know you’re being fooled. Think about that for a moment.

 
however like I said it may have been some kind of illusion. I just can't honestly convince myself of that because my mind says "I know what I saw and it was real and it wasn't my imagination".

 
So you’ve managed to convince yourself that it wasn’t an hallucination, or any other product of your brain. However, you still entertain the possibility that it was a trick involving another person. What you’re doing here is rejecting the most likely hypothesis and then adding in additional, unsubstantiated assumptions that aren’t required in order to explain your experience. In this case, you are adding in another person being involved (apart from yourself) even though you have no grounds on which to do this. Each time you add an unnecessary assumption to a theory you decrease the theory’s level of plausibility. In other words, it makes it more unlikely and less credible.

This has been explained to you before, so I wonder if you are having problems following this logic?

 
So basically, if I've tried to accept that it was probably an illusion, but I really don't think it was, then I'm not going to be dishonest with myself about it, and there really isn't anything else to be said. I don't know what it was and I'm not claiming it was some spirit of the departed. But it was there... whatever it was.

 
As Yoda might say “there is no try”. If you understood how critical thinking works you’d realise that there’s no ‘trying’ involved. You don’t need to ‘try’ to accept anything because logic and reason, combined with knowledge, does the hard work for you.

I'm telling you I play guitar and have dozed off while doing so. It is something you can do in your sleep. Now what? Maybe you've never gotten into a groove.
 
 
So I describe the known phenomonas (plural) of micro-sleeps and hallucinations caused by optical effects of conentrating vision on a single point.

Ufology replies by not discussing this, but instead discusses Highway Hypnosis, an entirely different phenomona where people drive for long stretches and "switch off", completing their drive with whole chunks of it "missing".

Hyighway hypnosis is neither of the phenomona I describe, both of which can occur while concentrating on other tasks with out impairing those tasks.

It seems ufology does not acknowledge any natural phenomenon that might explain his "spooky" anecdotes. Even when they're as plain as a firefly through a picture window.
 
 
You know, I'm pretty sure this will be ignored, but what the heck.

There's a story I've shared here before, that's one of my favorite ghost stories. It happened after teh graveside service for my grandmother on my father's side. I was in my early teens at the time.

The service was held at a small church in the backwoods in Mississippi. After the service, the family stayed around talking and such, both inside and outside the church. As dusk came around, several people (including myself) saw a figure standing on a nearby hill, under a tree. She was a woman, with long hair, completely white (skin, clothing, everything). She would walk slowly back and forth under the tree, occassionally disappearing entirely. We watched for a good 15 minutes or so. Finally, I went over the fence to get a closer look.

So what was it?

Well, I can garauntee, if no one went to check, this would be one of those "unexplainable" ghost stories. It was clearly a woman, several people saw it, there were no drugs or alcohol involved, and so forth.

What it actually turned out to be was a cow.

It was a cow that was all black, except for a white stripe that ran across it's shoulders and both front legs. Due to the lessening light, and the shade of the tree, the black part of the cow was not easily seen. When it turned sideways, all you could see was the white stripe walking. When it turned towards or away from us, the "woman" disappeared. It wasn't until I got closer that I was able to see all of it.

I can also garauntee that I would never have thought of that explanation, no matter how long I lived...and wouldn't have believed it if it was suggested at a later time (assuming I hadn't gone to investigate).

So what's my point? Do I think a cow walked through your house?

No. My point is this: It's easy for our minds to be fooled. And when we recall our memories, the mind frequently embellishes it to ft with with our notions of what we think or expect. The brain "smooths out" the rough edges of the story of memory. And often times, these factors lead us to exclude things that are likely causes of what we remember.

And more importantly, just because we can't think of a rational explanation doesn't mean there isn't one. There are likely dozens of explanations that are perfectly rational, that don't call on unproven and unlikely supernatural explanations, that we haven't and likely never will think of.
 
 
 
I woke up in the middle of the night with my bed shaking, like Exorcist shaking. But my dog (in the bed) didn't wake up and neither did my husband, and the rest of the house wasn't shaking.

So I just figured it was all in my head. Or else it was demons.  

 
You were dreaming you were awake. There are no demons.

I hadn't been drinking, and it was in the middle of the night. I did take some Benadryl to help me fall asleep. When it happened l did sit up partially, but when I saw the dog still sleeping I knew it was just me.

Cainkane1 : I know; thus my smileyface.  
 
 
Speaking of which, I woke up last night and was convinced that there was a snake in the bed with me. I'm not overly afraid of snakes, per se, but I wasn't exactly thrilled to have one wrapped around my left hand and slithering down my left leg. I quickly threw off the covers and batted away at where the snake was... turned out it was just a dream.

But the sensation was incredibly real from sleeping/dreaming to waking. In the fifteen or so minutes it took me to go back to sleep, I would have sworn that an actual snake had been in the bed.
 
 
So, last night I heard a loud THUMP from husband's room. This time the dog alerted, so I figured, hey I better check this one out.

My husband had been dreaming and fallen out of the bed.

Actually, the conversation moved past where i thought it was. The story was actually directed towards ufology and his ghost that couldn't be explained by anything.

But, in a case of internet imitating life, my timing sucks, as usual  

And feel free to share the story freely. I think it intuitively illustrates the counterpoint to all the "well, there's no other possible explanation!" arguments out there.

Years ago, a friend and I were having a conversation about the supernatural. I can't recall the exact context, but he swore, "You know, I'm just never gonna believe any ghost story that starts out with 'I woke up and...'"

I certainly sympathize with the sentiment.
Sleep is weird. Our brains are weird.

For me, the state of light sleep seems to magnify many sensations. I used to fall asleep studying in the college library, and if someone coughed or sneezed or moved a chair down the hall, it sounded to me like a canon firing. People around me didn't even seem to notice it.

We had an earthquake here a few years ago (they are uncommon in Louisville), and I felt it shake my bed. I was partly awakened by the window rattling; when I felt the tremor, I thought someone had broken into our house and was shakingemy bed. I sat upright ready for fight! My wife said she heard it and never really felt it, even though she was right next to me.
 
 
 
Actually, the conversation moved past where i thought it was. The story was actually directed towards ufology and his ghost that couldn't be explained by anything.

But, in a case of internet imitating life, my timing sucks, as usual  

And feel free to share the story freely. I think it intuitively illustrates the counterpoint to all the "well, there's no other possible explanation!" arguments out there.

 
I had read your account previously but appreciated seeing it again in the context of this thread. Thanks for sharing.

Awww, shucks  

Thanks for that. It's my one "cool story" with skeptical application   I'm a bit (irrationally) proud of it  
 
 
Exchange from the 1973 film The Exorcist which is uncannily apropos here:

Chris MacNeil: "No, the whole bed was thumping up and down on the floor -- with me on it!"
Doctor: "Mrs. MacNeil, the problem isn't your daughter's bed -- it's her brain."

 
 
 
Awesome   And I'm usually the one randomly inserting movie quotes into otherwise normal posts.
 
 
I think it's important -- and from the comments, only some of the posters know this -- that saying something was an hallucination or a microdream or a visual interruption does NOT mean "you didn't see anything". You *did* see something; but you interpreted it to be something other than what was actually there.

For example, in the case of optical illusions, you can see that Line A is longer than Line B, and that is indeed how your brain assess it; but if you measure with a ruler, you will learn that the two lines are the same length. However, the automated mechanisms for processing clues from the context around an object distort your perception. When you see an illusion or an hallucination, you do SEE it. But you aren't observing the object or condition in the real world that you see.

The Pacific Science Center in Seattle (a great place to visit, btw) has an area on body stuff, and includes a number of interesting facts, experiments, and illusions. One, which just fascinates me, is a TACTILE illusion. There are two tubes wound together. You touch one tube, and it is cold; you touch the other, and it is warm, but not unpleasantly so. But when you grab the coil so that you are touching both, your hand immediately jerks away as your nerves scream that you have just grabbed something burning hot -- as hot as boiling water. No matter how many times you touch each tube separately and assure yourself that it's just an illusion, your brain combines those two inputs into HOT and automatically makes you release and jerk back.

So our brain's automatized processing does a lot before we get that input into our conscious realm of focus. So it is with hallucinations, dreams, and visual perception. By its nature, it cannot be discerned to be "unreal" -- from the mind's perspective, it IS real. But that's not to say that someone standing next to you would perceive the same thing.

As one in the health care field, I am deeply aware of the difference between something being "psychosomatic" and something being "imaginary". Someone with psychosomatic symptoms IS having those symptoms; they're not making them up; they're not voluntarily having them. It's just that the cause of those symptoms is not a physical problem, but a psychological one. (The recent fooferah about the schoolgirls with psychosomatic issues in New York was rife with this error. "I'm not making this up" protests a victim, and she's not: but she isn't a victim of environmental poisoning, either.) There are psychosomatic seizure illnesses, for example!

So, ufology and others, just because you recognize that your experience may have been brain generated (or altered, if it was an ocular floater that was perceived as an external object--an hypothesis strengthened by it appearing first in your peripheral vision) doesn't mean that you "didn't see anything". You did. It just didn't have the real world cause that you originally assigned to it.

I have seen a hellhound jump the back fence of a rental house I lived in; and I once saw spiders the size of my hand (yech) crawling on the wall of my bedroom. In both cases, that is damned well what I SAW; but it isn't, I think, what was actually present. The first one was a product of a sleep-related hallucination, and the spiders were caused by Influenza A (do get your flu shot! it's worth it just to avoid the big spiders).

I am perfectly happy with the knowledge that what I experienced was not what the actual cause was. I know, from research and experience, that such events are common aspects of our brain's amazing functioning, which includes a lot of filling in details and screening out what is assumed to be background noise. I find the hypothesis that such an event occured to me a lot more likely than that mankind's grasp of the fundamental nature of reality, physics, and thermodynamics are all deeply flawed.

In other words, I trust reason and evidence more than folklore; and I admit to being human. It's not such a difficult task.

I swear, I've never been near your house! And the binoculars were for...um...bird-watching! Yeah!

Oh, wait...

nevermind.

Oh, and  . Great post  
 
 
It sounds like  Hypnagogia  to me. When I had trouble with sleep paralysis, I would often experience what I thought was the bed shaking and it seemed as real as this keyboard I'm typing on right now.
 
 
Reminds me of my brother. When my brother and I were both kids, we shared a room. One day, he started hearing "footsteps" of people in the house at night. For a long time, he would sporadically wake up shortly after bedtime, scared and shouting about hearing the footsteps. This happened irregularly; but at least once every couple weeks or so.

At first, my parents just wrote it off as a bad dream, and sent him back to bed. After a dozen or so times, they started assuming he was just attention-seeking. They tried to punish him for it (fortunately mildly). The fact that it continued, that he was clearly frightened, his consistent refusal to go back to bed until someone had actually verified house was empty, disabused them of that notion fairly quickly. He was thoroughly convinced the house had been invaded by robbers or something of that sort (normal stuff, nothing supernatural or unreasonable like ghosts or aliens). He was so convinced that he started to frighten me, even though I could never hear the footsteps.

Someone they consulted (our pediatrician, if memory serves) instructed them to look for something that had changed recent, maybe some sort of stressor or other alteration to his previous life or habits. Nothing much had changed, there were no unusual school or life stresses that were out of the ordinary for us. The only significant change they found was his diet, which had been substantially altered shortly before the hypnogogic hallucinations started (he had stopped taking his lunch to school, and had started eating school food).

They put my brother through a food-allergy-elimination diet, and after a lot of trial and error, found when they removed a certain food from his diet (don't recall what it was), the hallucinations stopped. The tricky part was convincing both him and themselves that the food was the problem, because it was something he had been able to eat before without any negative repercussions. In an uncharacteristic application of the scientific method, my parents theorized that the problem wasn't just the food, but also the amount he was eating, which had increased dramatically about the same time as the hallucinations started. They let him eat larger amounts of the stuff again just to verify that it was the problem, and the hallucinations started up again. So his increase in consumption of the allergen had hit some threshold dose, and triggered the hypnogogic hallucinations. After that, he pretty much quit eating it entirely, and the hallucinations stopped.
 
 
 
When I was just out of high school, my father helped me get hired, literally, at the salt "mines" where he worked. I was the lowest man on the totem, working on the salt-bagging lines, stacking salt on pallets so that they could be shipped. I was hired onto a 10 hour shift, and because the production plant was behind, we worked six or seven days a week. I have never worked so hard and so long in my life. I even dreamed of "throwing salt" when I was asleep. My pillow happened to be about the same size as a 50lb bag of salt, which was the most common variety. I woke up a number of times believing that I had been throwing salt, and that my pillow was a bag that hadn't been sewn properly. I would toss it aside and yell, "Sew 'em up!" I would then think for some reasons the lights were out in the production plant, and it was insane for them to make us work in the dark.

 
 
Never bagged salt in my sleep but I've configured a few Exchange servers.

I've had a few rather unique jobs in my past.
 
 
You might want to read Paranormality, by Richard Wiseman. It covers experiences like this in considerable depth.
 
 
 
Are you sure it wasn't an earthquake? I've been in a few that felt exactly like that.

 
I have had this experience. My then wife and I lived on the fifth floor of an apartment building and once in bed I felt an earthquake. Not so much a tremor as a gentle almost soothing sway that continued of a few seconds. I woke up my wife (it was about 1:00 a.m.) to tell her I felt a quake and went back to sleep. She stayed awake the whole night
