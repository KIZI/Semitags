To all the Hilltop Yankee Fans (Box, Cliff, Michael O, Mike C., etc)

Congratulations on your 13th consecutive playoff appearance, and a truly great 2nd half comeback....Best of luck to the pinstripes in the post season....and best of luck to Paul Flieg and his long suffering Cubbies....Now, if you'd be kind enough to excuse me while I prepare to say Kaddish for the Mets, and then quietly adjourn to the kitchen where I will be placing my head firmly inside the oven.....

To all the Hilltop Yankee Fans (Box, Cliff, Michael O, Mike  C., etc)

Congratulations on your 13th consecutive playoff appearance,  and a truly
great 2nd half comeback....Best of luck to the pinstripes in the  post
season....and best of luck to Paul Flieg and his long suffering  Cubbies....Now, if
you'd be kind enough to excuse me while I prepare to say  Kaddish for the Mets,
and then quietly adjourn to the kitchen where I will be  placing my head firmly
inside the oven.....

THE PINSTRIPES DO DESERVE KUDOS THIS YEAR FOR SURE. AND PAUL- SO HAPPY FOR
YOU AND THOSE CUBBIES (MY PADRES ARE GOING TO CLINCH TODAY AND MEET THEM IN
POST SEASON) ) BUT WHAT IN THE WORLD HAS HAPPENED TO OUR METS?? HOW CAN THIS
BE??
