 
 
If you were asked "who controls the state?"..
 
 
What would your answer be, and why?
 
 
The media I'd say. shaping people's opinion and play a big part in the state's process and our society's culture.

By the way kashmir.noirI love the quotes on your signature.

"What state?"

Because it's very pertinent.
 
 
The banks?
 
 
The Queen in Parliament under God, presumably in a legal sense.

In reality, the political parties.
 
 
You could go as far to say the public, as they vote in who they want to run the country.
 
 
Me.

Because I'm just that good.

But do you really think the media controls the state? In some countries the media is completely a)funded by the political parties and b)shut the beep up!

No sign of the elite in your answer? You dont think campaign contributors inadvertently control the state to some extent?

And about the quotes,   thank you. When I first put them up I thought maybe they were a little too serious!

Thats the clincher, any state! I thought this was wierd for a university exam past paper question, but interesting nonetheless.

Some things you just take for granted not to be asked as an exam question.

Theoretically, that should be it.Yes, in practice they can limit the extent of control of the state. But in practice do you really think voters have that much control?

A pluralist view then. So theres no chance you believe that the government is controlled by a political elite (oxbridge or harvardyale educated) that make their agenda behind the scenes?

Ahh, ok.

Control in a liberal democracy rests ultimately with the people, so elitist forms of power manipulation are propaganda based, this is as true of corporate profiteering as it is of election campaigning. The degree to which an individual or institution is successful in manipulating public sentiment either in favour of its agenda or simply preventing the public awareness from engaging with it directly determines that individual or institutions ability to pursue it's economic or political goals.

The corporate media is explicitly active or more often merely complicit by aggregate of it's make up in this process, remembering always that the corporate media relies on advertisers for 75% of it's revenue, making it's primary commodity not news or information, but demographs and readerships which it sells to other companies for advertising.

There is no specific corporate elite meeting in darkened back rooms, it is entirely unneccessary for the educated and wealthy political and corporate elite to meet in order to set their agenda for manipulation and control, they share the same agenda by dint of their shared economic and political circumstance, and work together to protect that agenda through a kind of social osmosis.

Well, If I listened to the rumours I would be.

To be honest I don't see how it's possible for anybody on here to answer the question. Simply because we do not know enough. There is no scale upon which to 'rank' people. And for all us mere students know, there could be another world of power that's hidden. I mean it could even be the case that the most powerful person/people in the country is/are unknown to the majority, It might sound like something out of a movie, but until anybody on here reaches any height of power you may not even realise what else is out there.

That said though, if you consider the power of media, entrepreneurs, aristocracy, government, foreign influences, terrorists and internal corruption, there's no way of determining who controls what. At least in my opinion. Politics isn't my strong point, so my knowledge is limited.

Whilst I completely understand what you are saying and slightly agree with it too, it is not only the corporate elite, but the political elite too. I feel there is a line between them, although ultimately after the same end.

Even if the only answer one can give is overly simplistic (I mean with a 1500 word limit, any answer to any question would be basic) it doesn't mean the question is stupid.

Fair enough. There is such a disparity between what theoretically should be so and what actually is.

Her Royal Powers are not executed by the executive of this country; pardons given to Home Secretary, Declaration of War given to PM and so on. These are the basics of UK Politics.

She is indeed a figure head and more besides. Darwin's face is indeed on our money but only on one note. The Queen is on every coin and note. It does follow that she has power because the crown is sovereign over the land. She is the ruler and appointed by "God"; she has power - possibly more than you'll ever know.

I addressed the first part of your post in previous post, God knows why your brought it up. Her sovereignty is executed by the Executive which I also mentioned in the last one. Convention means that she has no substantive power, at all. Even when she uses her own Royal Perogatives, she does so because the PM tells her to.

Was that irony?

Look the queen has powers. Some say that these powers are limited. But what goes on behind closed doors is anyone guess. And my guess is that the queen is far more powerful than we are led to believe. For a start she has the power to block any laws, as she is required on her discretion and as she sees fit, to give assent to any law before it is passed. And we don't exactly know what goes on behind closed doors. I suspect Gordon Brown comes up with a law and the queen gives a yea or nay. Isn't that an example of supreme power??

Whatsmore is that every queen in the past has been powerfull. There is no difference with this queen now; it's just that certain "things" have been put in place to make people believe that the queen is "just a figure-head", and "nothing more" according to some.
 
 
I'd say - "The people who want to".

Those with the ambition eventually inherit the state, whether it is through politics, media, business, whatever. These are also the people who probably aren't best suited to the power. Those who don't sit back and watch the fireworks.

You mean the thing that hasn't been refused in 300 years? The thing that she makes the decision based on what Ministers tell her to do? Riigggggggght.

Are you basing your judgements on how the British Political system works based on speculation? And no laws, legislation can be presented be anyone, in fact I could do so. Am I going to have to ask the queen?

Her power is delegated to parliament and to her government. If she tried to exercise her constitutional power as sovereign, we'd become a republic faster than you can say 'revolution'.

Actually, he does. It's the responsibility of the sovereign to do what her government tell her (or, if it were the case, him) to. For example, the sovereign is the one who dissolves parliament and calls a general election, but does not do so without the prime minister 'advising' her to.

This is your response? I can't say I'm not surprised. You are aware of the weekly meetings they have, yes? And also note that I didn't say PM tells her what to do (although in some cases that might be so), I said Ministers inform her on decisions about giving Royal Assent - a clear distinction. Please quote me in future.

Example would include Tony Blair taking us to war with Iraq in 2001 without discussing it with the rest of Parliament or even letting it open to the public. The consolidating wasen't there. He just followed our brother America. The Queen is really there for Royal Consent and tradition.

The banks own the country. ‘Give me control of a nation’s currency, and I care not who makes its laws.’ The country runs on money. But this is all an illusion. Allow me to explain.

HOUSE OF LORDS
CITY COUNCIL (see your local city council)

Also: universities, schools, media etc.

Search for all of these at  www.dnb.com 

They are all corporations. We have corporate courts, corporate politics, corporate everything. These are structured into larger conglomerates also. For example, local police in Kent will be incorporated into KENT POLICE. Churches in the UK are incorporated into CHURCH OF ENGLAND.

So let’s look at international politics. There is the UNITED KINGDOM CORPORATION LTD. Are we its employees? When you vote for politicians, you are voting for new directors of a corporation, nothing more.
The economic sphere has merged into all of the ‘public’ sectors. They are trading for profit, and have bankers/banks investing in them. The Rothchilds have served on the Board of Directors for the Bank of England and so have dictated policy. If these are all businesses, there is someone invested in the business who wants paying back - as in the famous Rothschild quote: ‘Give me control of a nation’s currency, and I care not who makes its laws.’

Our whole society runs on money. So have a look at a note of money. At the top it reads ‘Bank of England’. The Bank of England is run by private bankers. On the note is says ‘I promise to pay’, not ‘I pay’ – therefore it is a DEBT. Money is in circulation, therefore it is recycled DEBT.

It also says ‘the sum of twenty pounds’. Think about that for a moment - twenty pounds of what?
Of course, it used to be gold or silver, but not anymore. Gold or silver had a value. But why was gold valuable? You could say, it is rare, un-reactive, whatever. But why does that make it valuable? It is only valuable because people attributed value to it. So let’s use the same argument for money. It is only valuable because people attribute value to it. BUT on first principles you cannot attribute value to a debt.

(Remember the currency is controlled by the Bank of England, which sets all its own interest rates and the amount of money in circulation. If you look above the watermark on a note, it also says 'copyright the governor and company of the bank of england')
It then says ‘on demand’ so you are promising whoever you give the note to that you will pay them twenty pounds ‘on demand’ – whenever they want it. However, the twenty pounds doesn’t exist – it is a legal fiction created by the Bank of England.

So now we have financial crises. This is due to fractional reserve lending by the banks. There is a larger debt created by this than could ever be paid back by all of the money in circulation. But what does the corporation THE LABOUR PARTY then do? They give billions away! Hopefully you are beginning to see why.

So society is based on a legal fiction which is a debt (money) and all of the so-called public services are trading for profit. The media wouldn’t give you such information though – because it is composed of corporations!!

 

The Queen is a 'constitutional monarch' who is basically a mascot for the people of the country. She is bound by her coronation oath. Parliament are bound by their oath of office, and they swear allegiance to the Queen (as a mascot for the people) to work under common law). Politicians cannot overwrite common law, they can only confirm it.
The law of the country is under common law (this covers harm, injury or loss)
Most (actually almost all) of the theatre in parliament in the past decades has been through passing statutes, which works under contract law, not common law.
 
 
for me it would have to be my sister
 
 
i would say that the rich and businesses control the state. it doesnt matter who is in government, the ppl who pull the strings are the same. thats why we have a tax system which makes the rich richer and the poor poorer - its very easy for rich ppl to avoid tax. but govt dont go for them, they go for those at the bottom of society. and thats why big businesses etc are allowed to pay very little corporation tax (or none at all). the govt is very much controlled by the rich and businesses. sometimes directly (through MPs and Lords being paid to vote one way or another on a particular bill or ammend a particular bill) and usually indiretly - thru the fear of them leaving. actually that is still pretty direct control cos they are threatening to leave,arent they?
anyways. i'll continue. the media has a lot of power but again that is controlled by the rich. i'd also say the EU has a lot of power over the state, but again the rich and businesses control that. infact there's more corruption with the EU.

when you think about it we have very little control over our own lives. its sad. but i promise you (and myself) that i will always have the interests of the working and the middle class ppl of britain at heart when i'm an MP.
