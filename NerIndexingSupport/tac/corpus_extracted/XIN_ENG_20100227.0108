Four Togolese opposition parties are united under the umbrella of a Coordination
for Change ahead of the March 4 presidential elections.

The newly formed Coordination for Change includes the West African country's
second largest party, the Action Committee for Renewal (CAR) led by its
candidate Yawovi Agboyibo.

It also comprises the Democratic Convention of the African People (CDPA) headed
by candidate Kafui Adjamagbo-Johnson, the Organization to Build Togo in Unity
and Solidarity (OBUTS) under candidate Agbeyome Kodjo and the Citizens' Movement
for Democracy (MCD) of Me Tchassona Traore.

In a declaration released on Friday, the four parties said they had agreed to
bring together their resources and experiences in order to ensure a transparent
electoral process which is on course and to culminate on March 4.

"They agreed to put their hands together, to exchange among themselves the
information coming from their representatives in the National Independent
Electoral Commission (CENI)," the declaration said.

"In case one of the candidates wants to pull out of the race, he does so in
favor of one of the signatories," it added.

They also agreed to "defend their victory and to govern together" in case one of
them wins the elections.

The formation of the Coordination for Change came only six days before the
presidential vote.

Meanwhile, the United Forces for Change (UFC), the largest opposition party, has
formed the Republican Front for Change (FRAC) with four other allies.

The grouping includes the association launched by former French deputy and
minister of Togo origin Kofi Yamgnane, the Democratic Alliance for Integral
Development (ADDI), the Alliance Party and the Socialist Pact for Renewal (PSR).

There are six opposition candidates campaigning for the country's top post in
the contest with outgoing President Faure Gnassingbe, who is seeking his second
term after elected in April 2005, following the death of his father and
predecessor Gnassingbe Eyadema on Feb. 5, 2005.
