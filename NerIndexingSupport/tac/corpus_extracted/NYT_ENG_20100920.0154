The Federal Communications Commission is expected
Thursday to approve an overhaul of the $2.25 billion E-Rate
program, which subsidizes Internet service for schools and public
libraries. The program would give schools more options for faster
Internet service, allow for community Internet service and to begin
pilot programs for digital textbooks.

The proposed E-Rate order would allow schools and libraries to
use federal funds to lease unused local communication lines -- known
as dark fiber -- to connect to the Internet, a potentially faster
and lower-cost connection than currently offered through many local
telecommunications companies.

Some schools still do not have broadband connections, the FCC
noted in its National Broadband Plan, released this year. The
company that administers E-Rate received at least 200 requests in
the 2009 fiscal year for money to pay for dial-up Internet
connections. The program mostly serves schools in poor and rural
communities. At its monthly meeting Thursday, the FCC also will
consider allowing schools to open the use of Internet resources
paid for with E-Rate funds to the local community after school
hours and when school is not in session, which is currently not
allowed under E-Rate regulations.

"For the good of our economy, we need all of our kids to be
digitally literate," Julius Genachowski, the FCC chairman, said in
an interview.

Job postings are increasingly available online only, he said,
while a growing percentage of jobs require basic digital skills as
a prerequisite.

The commission also is expected to approve a pilot program that
supports off-campus wireless Internet connections for use with
mobile learning devices, like digital textbooks. That would allow
schools to update their textbooks more frequently and save students
from having to carry back-breaking loads of textbooks home each
night.

The E-Rate program, which is financed by a fee collected from
all telephone users, came under fire from Congress in 2004 for
wasteful spending. Changes in accounting regulations and program
rules led to a temporary suspension of new grants that year.
