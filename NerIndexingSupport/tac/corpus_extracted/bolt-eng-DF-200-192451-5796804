Will Iran be attacked? - Yes. Will UK be active in that - Unsure.

Yes, Iran can not be trusted with WMD's.

Why should our people die protecting israel when they wont listen to us when we ask them to stop going too far in their treatment of palestine? Its about time our help came with the condition of them not exacerbating the situation with white phosphorus and the like.
 
 
Mark my words. No other country will attack Iran except for Israel, with perhaps military support in terms of intelligence from the US/UK. The UK does not have the means to carry out an attack on Iran. - Forget the fact that the US/UK/NATO would never get the support from the international community to carry out an attack. Israel? They can do what they want.

Why dont we? Theyre talking about missiles. We have missiles.

i like how this is from the 2nd of November?! 4 weeks late much?
 
 
i dread to think of the consequences if UK attacks Iran. So many countries with various allegiences a possible WW3?
 
 
i cant wait to be vaporised.

Although that particular missile hasn't yet been built or I should say, is not in service with the British military, we do have the capability to attack Iran with Tomahawk missiles.

I actually meant the political/international means/support. I don't think an attack on Iran would ever get pass a UN vote. Simple as that. Plus could you imagine the public uproar in the UK? It just won't happen. While it seems Israel would be able to get away with attacking Iran. (cite: Iraq and the Syrian nuclear centrifuges)

We don't have the means ?

I hope you aren't suggesting we don't have the military means...

Political means, I'd be surprised if we didn't have those too. Since when was a war not conducted without full support from the wider, international community?

I think the only deciding factor here would be whether or not a nuclear retaliation from Iran would be a genuine threat. Saying that, with current defenses against ICBMs, I'd say its likely the combined anti-ICBM systems could contain launches from Iranian soil, no matter where they may be.

I hope this is a situation that doesn't form. I wouldn't want to see a war with Iran, as it would be lead to a much higher loss of life then anything we saw in Iraq or Afghanistan. Unlike the Taliban, I don't think the Iranian Forces would be scared to meet NATO forces in open battle.

This. I would wager the UK has plans to accommodate any hostile military action from any force on the planet.

Plus you have to wonder what Russia and China's actions would be if so... That's the more worrying thing

Really? I know there is a lot of research down that way but I did't think there were good reliable systems in place yet

That's another point. I'm no expert on international relations to any high degree, and I certainly am not aware of what Russia and China think of Iran.

I would be willing to bet Russia had a few backdoor deals, though. Like any Nation, I agree, but ICBM carcasses and SCUD systems aren't the easiest things to get.

Russia's FROG is a prime example of a mobile ICBM system, if Iran bought any... Maybe I'm stabbing in the dark at Russia here, but I wouldn't be surprised if Russia had had anything to do with Iran's nuclear weapons program.

Back in regards to an actual attack on Iran, I wonder where Russia and China stand in regards to an Iran/America-UK War. Might be worth reading up on the history between the three of them, actually.

Russia would condemn the attack in the strongest possible terms. If they were gonna really do anything theyd have sold iran those missile defense systems. I dunno about china. Theres not much they could do military wise.

Interesting festive period ahead.

Seems china is talking tough on the issue. If they think they could fight ww3 with the us theyre delusional. They only just got an aircraft carrier and as I pointed out in another thread, in terms of force projection, cant compete with us let alone the us.
 
 
It shouldn't be as bad as Afghanistan. Fingers crossed it will just be a conventional war - go in, win, install a government that is friendlier, go home. Rather than having to stick around fighting those who can't take the fact they lost. Then again that is the Arab way, so who knows?!
 
 
 
Really? I know there is a lot of research down that way but I did't think there were good reliable systems in place yet

 

Ahh, admittedly if we had the same levels of anti-ICBM warfare kits that we're currently researching, it would be pointless to even think of launching one. If we'd had America's STAR-WARS system, we'd know about a launch as soon as the first coordinate was placed into the tracking system.

However, we still have two systems in operation that can quell a potential strike once the ICBM is airborne. One is the A35 ABS (Anti-Ballistic System) which was purchased off the Russians. And the second is the GMD (Ground-based Midcourse Defense) in America. Both could have up to a 70% success rate of destroying ICBMs launched against Europe and America, the respective systems are in the respective continents.

Furthermore, many Naval Vessels such as the USS Shiloh are equipped with RIM-161 ABS rockets. Now granted, these only have a 30% success rate, but fire enough of them, and the chances are that they will destroy an enemy ICBM.

Israel also has its own defense systems, and given its proximity could use these to a much greater effect. The Arrow Missile is an ABS and the " Iron Dome " are the two currently operational systems. A third system, " David's Sling " is currently still in development. But with this situation brewing, its production is likely to have been sped up.

The Royal Navy's Type-45 Destroyers are armed with Aster 15 and 30 missiles, as well as the Sea-Viper. And France is currently developing the Aster 30 MkII.

Finally, there's the modified Jumbo 747 (I forget its name) which uses a laser to destroy the tracking system. And there have also been confirmed tests in which fighter-aircraft have successfully tracked and destroyed in-flight dummy ICBMs. The rocket system that propels them still provides a huge heat-signature, easily enough to be acquirable to most of today's Air-to-Air missiles. The tests themselves used the Sparrow missile, and if this proves to be repeatedly successful event after more tests, we would have an anti-ICBM system capable of keeping pace and successfully being able to seek and destroy airborne ICBMs.

The main problem would be MIRVs, which separate into (usually) half a dozen different warheads. Granted, the aforementioned systems are designed to destroy the weapons before they reach the stage in which they separate, but there's currently only one even remotely working system on the planet designed to work against such threats: The LG1-118A Peacekeeper. Its test, had the nuclear warheads been live, would've successfully made 25 Hiroshima-style blasts up in the atmosphere to destroy a wave of incoming MIRV/ICBM systems. However, defense experts agree that the MIRV has made every ABS system currently in full time operation economically ineffective, and practically non-workable. Thankfully, the MIRV systems are hard to create, and I would highly doubt Iran possess the technology or parts to create even one system, let alone enough to force the invading forces into submission.
 
 
Should we start stockpiling?
 
 
How do these anti-ICBM systems work?  

Surely if the UK, US, India, ( maybe) Pakistan and other allies form together and target thier weapons at Iran (maybe China and Russia if they get involved) then we have wiped them out no?

I think I am wrong in thinking that you just send a bomb onto the nuclear facility, government building or military HQ right?
 
 
Could've seen this coming years ago, what do you expect from imperialist nations?

Hmm, thanks for the detailed response. Still it seems like a lot is left to chance. 70% is not an odd I want to play when there is a 30% chance of complete destruction.

I'm afraid you're wrong there.

Were China to fully begin military operations on a global scale, there is nothing that could hold them back. America's military might is beyond super-power, but technology doesn't win a battle. China's vast numbers and the ability to move vast amounts of equipment, supplies and ammunition behind the advancing forces would see a catastrophic war.

Throw a supportive Russia and Iran into the mix, and leave us with Israel, much of NATO and ourselves, we'd be walked over. America, as I said, is the dominant superpower in terms of military might on this planet. However, should China be pushed and prodded enough to initiate a full-blown war, in which it would certainly begin a state of drafting every able bodied person, and then use the rest to create vast droves of equipment, America just couldn't compete.

America's forces are by no means small. The USMC is the smallest of America's fighting forces, and they still outnumber our combined military force, but China could draft millions upon millions of men and would have the ability to arm them all. Remember, there's an AK47 for every 11 people on the planet. And considering the entirety of China's dedicate armed forces utilize the Type-95 Rifle among others, they could arm every single civilian they draft in with arguably the best assault rifle in the world, magazines aplenty, food and water and send them out.

It depends on the system. Most use a second explosion (so another rocket) to destroy the main body of the ICBM. You can't detonate a nuclear warhead with an explosion, it doesn't work that way, so they aren't concerned about throwing large explosions at it. Even if it doesn't fully destroy the whole ICBM, it certainly wont be flying anywhere, and thus its usefulness is simply non-existent afterwards.

Others use a solid round, such as the American GMD. It fires a large projectile at it and just blows a hole through it. Once again, the ICBM is no longer able to operate.

Finally, the American's 747 uses a laser to fry the targeting systems. It just drops from the sky after that.

Most systems can only acclaim to be around 30-40% effective at best. Which isn't ideal, but the principal of "fire-enough-at-it-and-hope-for-the-best" still works effectively here.

Iran can't stand against America and the UK in a conventional war. If we had the help of the nations you named, then we'd crush them even more so. But we'd have to go in and fully root out any lasting military forces.

Even without dedicated leadership, I would wager that NCOs and remaining Officers could still organize effective guerilla-war type actions against the invading forces. An ambush of anti-armour and anti-infantry weaponry would destroy a convoy, and that's something we can't be seen to lose. So we'd send in forces to dig out and destroy the remaining military-capable enemy combatants. Thankfully, we have the technology to do that, though I'd imagine it would return to an Afghan-like state of trying to get the enemy out of their holes, and that takes time, money, resources and most importantly, lives.
 
 
Depends on the US, Pakistan and China I think. China generally opposes the US influence in the east, if China agrees to help Iran by providing missiles and general weapons, then the west would have a hard time trying to invade Iran. The only viable option would be to cut off Iran completely from China, only after that can the west consider a successful attack.

The recent "accident" by Nato killing Pakistan troops, could have been to provoke a aggressive response against the US by Pakistan. If Pakistan retaliated, then the US would be able to secure strategic points in Pakistan, hence cutting off Iran from China. I think Pakistan chose the wise option by telling US to gtfo.

But it's just my theory

There is your problem though, China does not have the ability to move those men. And judging from their military expansion programs they are focusing on negating American advantages and keeping them out of certain areas but they are not gearing up for a direct confrontation with the US. China seems pretty focused on their own spheres of influence, rather than challenging America. I'd be shocked if we saw a direct war between them.

Your also assuming that the Chinese would be able to convince there people to fight. China's economy may well be heading for trouble and the state is becoming more and more jittery about dissent and what the masses think. Throw in the strain of a war and the whole thing may collapse.

I don't know about the numbers vs tech debate, I'm not really sure if thrown against a reasonable sized well equipped force numbers will win.
 
 
 
Hmm, thanks for the detailed response. Still it seems like a lot is left to chance. 70% is not an odd I want to play when there is a 30% chance of complete destruction.

 

Absolutely, and this is the issue. Those are the most effective systems, and sadly 70% is probably the best we're ever going to achieve.

Thankfully, though, these systems span in huge "webs" across America and much of Europe. And that's a 70% success rate from one ABS system within that web. Combine them together, and it raises to 140%, 230%, 300% etc.  

However, I agree. 70% is still far too much left to chance. These systems do cooperate, but they are too far apart for my liking. An effective AB system to me would utilize everything we have that could possibly damage or destroy an ICBM and I'd create a wall that would hopefully increase that percentage enough to ensure nothing could pass.

Unfortunately, they fly quite quickly. I'm not sure the response time of our aircraft or AB systems, but I'd bet that an ICBM from Iran would reach Europe a lot quicker.

Oh I see.  

Thanks.  

Hopefully it won't escalate into a war. I bet Dave is feeling pretty stupid for scrapping half of our missiles and armed forces?  

I wonder if they will introduce conscription etc..... if it gets really bad?   I say strike and destroy thier parliament/senate building and the president/PM house when **** seems to happen. Maybe a wave of assasinations on key people in Iran perhaps?

China doesn't have the ability to move all those men over to America. I was writing under the assumption that China would react to a war with Iran. In a world-wide situation, I'd still stand by a Chinese victory only if allied with Russia and Iran.

But yes, it was written in a completely hypothetical manner, assuming China had been pushed into the corner so much it had no other choice. The chances of it actually happening are remote, but it was just as a potential situation.

I'm afraid in the past numbers have often superseded tech. Sun Tzu famously wrote that with the right factors, a small force could defeat a large one. I'd agree, most of the time. However, look back to the Russian retaliation against Germany. Stalingrad was only one on the backs of the snipers and the fact that the Political Commissars were willing to throw thousands of men at German lines until they simply ran out of ammo or were overrun. The Germans had arguably the best tech of WWII, but look at how well that did them when they didn't have the numbers.  

Its essentially the same principal. Granted, the German's didn't have access to B-52 carpet bombing, or targeting systems that could pick out every armoured vehicle within a 20 mile radius and put a missile inside it. But with the numbers, I'd say it would still be quite the victory.

And its not to say China doesn't have its own tech.

But yes, moving such numbers across to America on its own would be the ultimate challenge. Against Europe, though, China has the ability to cross almost all of Asia to almost all of Europe and the Middle East between. And we have nothing on these continents that could stand against them, unless Russia took up arms against them alongside us.

Eventually, if China managed to control Europe, moving men across the Pacific/Atlantic would only take a few hundred large container ships. Given China's navy and air-force could keep a more-then-adequate watch over the forces as they crossed, and going by the impression much of America's main oversees force would've been on one of the three aforementioned continents during this little scenario, I doubt America could hold.

Again, this is entirely unlikely. And as you say, internal politics would restrict much of it. But under the impression that China simply had no other choice, well, you don't corner a tiger.

Im not convinced. Blokes with ak47's are nothing in the face of the unrestrained power of the us and allies. Technology does win a battle. And how exactly are they going to "send them out"? Send them fighting their way to iran in the style of germanys advance towards moscow?
 
 
Just thought I'd point out that...

Considering all UK diplomats are no longer in Iran then....
Kinda makes the whole process of going to war a bit easier

You cant just march an army across a continent. As soon as they were away from a civilian area theyd be blown to smithereens by missiles from submarines against which rifles would be no use.
 
 
 
What does everybody think about the possibility of going to war with Iran?The US are making moves encouraging a very likely chance of war!

Do you think it will happen?
Do you think it should happen?

Discuss...

 

Plans and attacks are not the same thing. Not even close. There were many a plans for war between the UK and USA pre ww2, none of which happened.
I plan for fire drills, doesn't mean someone is going to start a fire...
Better to plan that to not.

I dont think war is needed though, step up sanctions like we have done in North Korea, destroy their economy. Iran has enough issues with its own people, without getting into a fight with the rest of the world.
They have always been 'pissy' with the UK - Its just another war of words.

 
Mark my words. No other country will attack Iran except for Israel, with perhaps military support in terms of intelligence from the US/UK. The UK does not have the means to carry out an attack on Iran. - Forget the fact that the US/UK/NATO would never get the support from the international community to carry out an attack. Israel? They can do what they want.

 

I agree with you on Isreal.
Yet we most defiantly do have the means to carry out an attack on Iran. If we dont, what makes you think Isreal does?
 
 
 
 
 
I'll reiterate what many have said, it's a contingency plan...

Like the US apparently having a contingency plan against an alien invasion...

Might as well say if China allied with space aliens. Russia will not be fighting NATO because Putin's fortune derive from trade with the west. An extremely unlikely scenario, Russia uses NATO distraction to recapture its former satallites, but will not attack the west. A "greater Iran" is a serious threat to Moscow, it is the Chinese that are mostly pushing Iran to the finish line, Russia simply just wants to make life uncomfortable for the west not see their defeat.

 
But yes, it was written in a completely hypothetical manner, assuming China had been pushed into the corner so much it had no other choice. The chances of it actually happening are remote, but it was just as a potential situation.

 

The problem with your scenario is that China does not have many resources of its own. It is mostly imported and the high seas are where the allies dominate. In addition many of the nations that do export these resources are firmly in western clutches. Iron to China comes from Australia for example. The Imperial Japanese Navy could not defeat the Americans and they were much, much more evenly matched than the pathetic Chinese fleet is. A rusty 1970s hull used for its carrier? The USA has a dozen top of the range carriers with a new generation coming online.

Chinese shipping arrives through some very narrow straights that are easy for superior navies to control. Quite frankly, if China stuck its nose out the USA could just choke it to death. China will politically implode before any armies march over Asia. Also China cannot send armies into the regions you seem to think they can because they're shut in by bottlenecks in every direction west. There is a reason why China is the size it is today and why India is not chinese. You cannot march great armies through these passes and if China tried it would be a sitting duck for allied aerial forces.

 
I'm afraid in the past numbers have often superseded tech. Sun Tzu famously wrote that with the right factors, a small force could defeat a large one. I'd agree, most of the time. However, look back to the Russian retaliation against Germany. Stalingrad was only one on the backs of the snipers and the fact that the Political Commissars were willing to throw thousands of men at German lines until they simply ran out of ammo or were overrun. The Germans had arguably the best tech of WWII, but look at how well that did them when they didn't have the numbers.  

 

The Russian tanks were superior.

Most German armor losses were occuring due to attrition and weather. Russian tanks did not have this huge loss rate in the mud and winter because they were built with wider tracks etc. Russia had the better tanks, it's no good having a slightly bigger main gun if the other tank has a 10 times better chance of getting through the winter. Russian tech was actually superior in several areas, although German units were of higher quality.

 
Its essentially the same principal. Granted, the German's didn't have access to B-52 carpet bombing, or targeting systems that could pick out every armoured vehicle within a 20 mile radius and put a missile inside it. But with the numbers, I'd say it would still be quite the victory.

 

The difference was Russian units in WW II could close with the enemy. Germans might of had superior units overall but at least the Russians could get in range to fire back. I do not believe that men armed with AKs can even get within range of a modern army in a total war scenario. The only reason the Taliban can achieve it is because we're playing by strict legal restrictions and trying to build up Afghanistan.

 
But yes, moving such numbers across to America on its own would be the ultimate challenge. Against Europe, though, China has the ability to cross almost all of Asia to almost all of Europe and the Middle East between. And we have nothing on these continents that could stand against them, unless Russia took up arms against them alongside us.

 

Sorry simply not possible. Would also be better if Russia remained neutral so that Chinese units didn't enter Siberia.

 
Again, this is entirely unlikely. And as you say, internal politics would restrict much of it. But under the impression that China simply had no other choice, well, you don't corner a tiger.

 

China is a dangerous nation but you seriously over-state it. It has no power projection beyond its immediate neighbours and it will have to accept whatever happens in Iran happens in Iran. It is so economically dependent and the ruling party so dependent on the economy, that it cannot do what you seem to think it can.
 
 
War is always a great way of sorting the economic system out....

Iranians will pay for the west's greed.
 
 
Once again Keynesian economics will end up reliant on a war to rebuild economies. What a surprise.

Chances are though that Israel will do the main legwork in any assault on Iran.

Isn't all this a bit Cold War? I thought STAR-WARS was Reagan's space-based baby which was ill-conceived and never got off the ground? I know the US is working on its missile defence systems at the moment, but they're far from reliable and is it not still meeting resistance from Russia et al when it comes to placing these defences in Eastern Europe?

You won't be able to go on about "the West's greed" if Ahmadinejad decides that Allah told him to press the big red button. Call me an oil-grabbing neo-Con lunatic, but I'd say that nuclear weapons are a particularly dangerous thing when they are in the hands of the unelected head of an authoritarian theocracy.

I'd rather it didn't come to it, but a well-aimed missile strike at Iran's nuclear facilities would solve a lot of problems, at least in the short-run.

Oh, no no, I meant if it had been working, and had been advanced to modern standard. Not if it was the Cold War era of tech.  

But yes, they still haven't managed to set up missile-defenses on the European continent. As I said, the UK and other Nations within the EU have bought Russian AB Systems, which are in my opinion much more reliable then the GMD that Bush put forth along the America's coast-lines and central line.
 
 
 
Why should our people die protecting israel when they wont listen to us when we ask them to stop going too far in their treatment of palestine? Its about time our help came with the condition of them not exacerbating the situation with white phosphorus and the like.

 

Since when does morality and politics have anything to do with eachother?

So could the USA withstand a missile attack from Iran? Let's assume that it hasn't acquired MIRVs yet, and is just using ten, simultaneously launched, single-warhead missiles.
 
 
Oh God please no  
 
 
Nah. I've reassessed the possibilities. The US will cry wolf on China's ass and start something big with them. What's a man to do when he's got no money left?
 
 
Israel are like Milwall. Everyone hates them and they don't give a ****. Which is good for us, really - they're an alarm. They have the means to do anything we could do, and a lot more (thanks to their proximity). They also have the most to lose by Iran developing threats, and most likely the most... significant intelligence network in that area of the world. All that considered, if they haven't attacked Iran yet, I don't think we need to worry just yet.
 
 
As much as I'd enjoy seeing Iran's government being dismantled, I'm afraid I have the feeling that this isn't actually going to lead to another conflict in the near future.
The MoD's statement is just being used as a bit of a threat: a message for Iran to behave itself.
I doubt the UK, or any members of NATO including the US, will be willing to get involved in another conflict at the moment.

This, sadly, might be a sign that we'll soon need to find a solution to the situation in Afghanistan.
If, at any point, some conflict were to escalate in a matter of months, having a large portion of our military stuck in Afghanistan may lead to dissaster. Our involvement in Lybia, which wasn't much, was enough to put strain on the RAF. A situation with Iran would probably lead us to quickly withdrawing from Afghan, and effectively ****ing up the country.

I think it's comming towards the time to make a deal in the Taliban's favour.  
 
 
What this could lead to is a conflict between the powerful Iran and the NATO supported Israel.
Especially if Israel decides to pull off something similar to what they did to Iraq's nuclear facilities 30 years ago.
 
 
 
So could the USA withstand a missile attack from Iran? Let's assume that it hasn't acquired MIRVs yet, and is just using ten, simultaneously launched, single-warhead missiles.

 

Relying solely on the GMD system, I wouldn't say so, no. The tracking systems for the weapon is arguably the best in the world, but even it can't hit the target more then 70% of the time.

It fires a large projectile from a rocket system within a certain range. The rocket will put it up to a certain distance, then it'll fire it from the warhead nose. However, it requires direct conjunction between the targeting systems on the ground, and the systems within the missile itself.

As you can imagine, factors such as connectivity, windage, weather, atmospheric conditions, etc. all factor into the equation, and even with what equates to a 7,000mbs connectivity speed, it can't equalize all the time with 100% efficiency. That, and they stupidly decided to control the whole system from one location.

That presents two problems; a much larger chance of it being destroyed and the signal must reach from Washington DC to the GMD stations. The furthest being California/Texas way. Even the closest, which is housed just outside DC, the response time for targeting was still 10 seconds. That sounds quick, but if we assume the ICBM's are traveling at mach 2... Suddenly they are covering a couple of miles within ten seconds, and it must constantly adjust with conversation between the signal station and the GMD Station... The furthest took like three minutes to connect and acquire a target... It just isn't efficient.

So no, with ten targets, relying solely on the GMD stations alone more then a few would get through. I'd estimate six of the ten would get through the wall, especially if fired at the same place, or along a "line" across the USA. If they were spread for different cities (the most likely scenario), I'd still only put it at 7/10, maybe 8 at a push? Lose any City and suddenly the situation seems a lot bleaker.

However, they'd use all the assets available to them. And with that, I'd safely bet a 10 out of 10 success rate.

Stick one MIRV in that group, ensure a division of its warheads within the same proximity of another ICBM decoy, and you'll see a 100% success rate in the nuclear attack. They can't differentiate between a real and a decoy, and they need manually reloaded after each shot with a 20-foot missile. Its not a subtle system. It works, quite well, but against that American cities wouldn't come out well.

At the furthest distance, it would be almost impossible to

Seems china is talking tough on the issue. If they think they could fight ww3 with the us theyre delusional. They only just got an aircraft carrier and as I pointed out in another thread, in terms of force projection, cant compete with us let alone the us.

 

Yea, but throw Russia into that equation headed by Putin and UK will just be a no-mans land in an extremely hostile situation.

Could yo elaborate on how exactly a war of this sort, which would cost trillions of dollars will help sort the economy out? I'm a bit confused is all.  
 
 
 
We don't have the means ?

I hope you aren't suggesting we don't have the military means...

Political means, I'd be surprised if we didn't have those too. Since when was a war not conducted without full support from the wider, international community?

 

Pretty sure Libya had wide political support. But I don't think Iran would get the same treatment. Unless it actually launch a nuclear missile or ICBM at another country. However I don't think that is likely.

I'm sorry, but Israel looks to be the only country that wants to get involved militarily. The US doesn't want to get involved that much, so my guess would be is that they would only supply intelligence information. - Perhaps along with the British. So I really do doubt you'll see any British missiles being fired into Iran.

It's fairly obvious that the west would annihilate any and every opponent in such a conflict, but equally obvious that this would benefit nobody and that Iran really isn't that important. China are being frankly quite stupid considering given how much an Iranian nuclear weapon would destabilise other nations nearby that they also get oil from.

Have you ever wondered why China doesnt have a problem with Islamic terrorism?

It is as I have sort of wrote above, they stay out of conflicts with countries like that.

If tonight (not going to happen, but good for an example), Isreal and US missles pummled Iran, China would call for carm and thats about it.

Thefore from the view of the non western world it is not supporting the west (and people wont attack it), and from the view of the west, they are no threat. Everybody wins.

I wish some people would think before they start talking complete bull crap.
 
 
China and to a lesser extent russia have far too much to gain from the US/west to take take up arms with a nation as volatile as iran. The most they'll do is condem it and perhaps sneakily supply arms to the country (maybe).
 
 
 
It shouldn't be as bad as Afghanistan. Fingers crossed it will just be a conventional war - go in, win, install a government that is friendlier, go home. Rather than having to stick around fighting those who can't take the fact they lost. Then again that is the Arab way, so who knows?!

 

Iranians are not Arabs. Neither are Afghans. Get it right.
 
 
I think israel and the U.S can go it alone on this one. However, if they need us we can give another middle eastern ass whooping  

Hopefully we dont go to war though...atleast until im in the airforce

Believe me, you were better off before the edit.

There is more than a "slight" difference. Iranians are caucasians, and Indo-European in terms of language...in short we're more similar to Europeans than to Arabs. We speak Persian, not Arabic. Our customs, culture, religions, history and names are completely different to those found in Arab countries. We do not follow "Arab customs" at all. Similarly, Arabs are a semitic people being closer to Jews rather than Iranians.

Likewise, Afghans speak Dari or Pashto, not Arabic.

I am utterly astonished that someone as active as you on these forums can't grasp the simple concept that a) not everyone in the Middle East is an Arab and that b) a population's reaction to war has nothing to do with the "Arab way" anyway, like you contended.

 
That's like saying there is no hogeneity between Spain and Portugal... And you of course know that a reasonable amount of Iranians actually are Arabs.

 

Yes, that 2% make all the difference. Very reasonable  

There is no "homogeneity". I assume that's what you mean by "hogeneity" anyway. I'll be happy to prove you wrong (again), because unlike you, I'm aware of the racial make up of the Middle East, the Persian language and Middle Eastern history, all three of which aren't your forte.

I understand you're prone to stubborness and an inability to concede when you're wrong, but on this particular topic (i.e. Iran) it's really in your best interest to just let it go and accept you were wrong.

Thank you for correcting me with more depth, I honestly just thought Iranians were just a different sort of Arab, a bit like Yemini Jews.
 
 
 
Mark my words. No other country will attack Iran except for Israel, with perhaps military support in terms of intelligence from the US/UK. The UK does not have the means to carry out an attack on Iran. - Forget the fact that the US/UK/NATO would never get the support from the international community to carry out an attack. Israel? They can do what they want.

 

a) Most Western armies would flatten Iran due to tech and training.
b) Most of the World wants Iran to be attacked - Saudi Arabia was even found to have asked the USA to launch a full on invasion.
c) Israel will attack Iran and if left to their own devices, have a horribly bloody war thus it is in everyones interest to also invade in order to help Iran.

You're welcome, but no, we're totally different in terms of language, culture, etc. Glad you're clear on it now  
 
 
Everyone is creaming their panties about the possibility of WW3. Exciting as it would be, it ain't going to happen. Russia and the US didn't even have the balls to attack each other during the Cold War when they were openly enemies. Now that they at least pretend to be friends it's even more unlikely. It's all about mutually assured destruction.

Between who? Arabs & Persians? Arabs & Kurds?

There is a slight genetic difference between any population group.

No.

 
They also follow an Arab religion
 

Leaving aside the fact that Shi'ite Islam is a synthesis between Persian culture and Shi'ite Islam. Iranians have typically been much less devout than Arabs, and practice/practiced Islam in a very different manner. Many Iranians today are not hugely religious and amongst young Iranians Shi'ite Islam is in a bit of a crisis. I see you have ignored the indigenous Persian faith (Zoroastrianism) as well, and the fact that Islam entered Iran via conquest. The Arab invasion remains a huge issue for many Iranians today (I don't personally bear grudges for events that happened over 1,000 years ago - but a huge number of Persians are able to) and there is (unfortunately in my view) quite considerable animosity between Arabs and Persians.

 
, speak Arabic in a lot of cases
 

What the hell does this prove? Plenty of Chinese people speak English?

Young Iranians are more likely to be wanting to learn English anyway, not least because of having negative (unfair in my opinion) opinions of Arabs & Arabia.

 
and follow a lot of Arab customs.
 

Persian culture is totally, totally different. Anyone who knows a little about the dynamics of the ME knows this.

What Arab customs do Persians follow? Ferdowsi? Nowruz? The Persian language? Cyrus?

Since the 1979 Islamic Revolution the West and the theocratic regime in power has presented, with saddening consistency, a distorted image of Iran portraying it as a seething mass of Islamic lunacy and backwards fundamentalism. Those unaware of Iran 's history could be forgiven for believing that Iran knows nothing but Islam. The reality is far more complex and hopeful. Publicly many Iranians accept their Islamic identity, however, most are also aware and cherish deeply their pre-Islamic Persian identity. The tension between these competing identities has existed since the Arab-Islamic takeover of Iran in the seventh century.

I don't know why I didn't clock that it was you. I just lumped you in with your normal, get on my case to be pedantic, poster. Instead of putting you in my 'respect' group like I usually do. I also don't know what I was thinking writing Arabs, when I meant Middle Eastern any way. Sorry.

Obama doesn't want to involve himself in another war or attack on another country. I think he got a lot of bad press on Libya, even though he stayed very quiet on that issue.

 
a) Most Western armies would flatten Iran due to tech and training.
b) Most of the World wants Iran to be attacked - Saudi Arabia was even found to have asked the USA to launch a full on invasion.

 

Of course Saudi Arabia wants Iran to be attacked. Iran considers it to be an agent for the US and I don't think Saudi Arabia takes too kindly to that view. Especially with the recent assassination attempt on a Saudi diplomat which the US says was sponsored by Iran.

 
c) Israel will attack Iran and if left to their own devices, have a horribly bloody war thus it is in everyones interest to also invade in order to help Iran.

 

Israel will most likely attack the facility they believe that uranium is being enriched. But they won't have a conventional war with Iran. It will involve air power (Missiles, fighter-jets etc), which Israel has experience in and covert operations.

How do you win?

That's exactly what we thought when we went into Iraq and Afghanistan.
 
 
 
Do you think it will happen?
Do you think it should happen?

 

Yes.
Yes as long as there are plans in place for an exit that doesn't turn into Iraq.

I don't think that the UK should be involved however as this is a US/Israeli fight.
 
 
 
Obama doesn't want to involve himself in another war or attack on another country. I think he got a lot of bad press on Libya, even though he stayed very quiet on that issue.

Israel will most likely attack the facility they believe that uranium is being enriched. But they won't have a conventional war with Iran. It will involve air power (Missiles, fighter-jets etc), which Israel has experience in and covert operations.

 

Very true, but do you not think that if the facility in question just blew up that Iran wouldn't just declare war on Israel? I doubt that Iran could suffer such a humiliating and obvious blow without retaliating in some form.
 
 
 
Lol what's Britain's plan for a war with America?

 

Surrender.  

No, in seriousness, probably initiating small-unit action agaist key targets within the US. After eradicating what US forces there are based within the UK, of course. Fortifying the West Coast, placing the entire Royal Navy in the Atlantic and moving every combat aircraft over to Western-Based airfields.
Activate the secondary and tertiary reserves, increase the military fund and initiate much larger armament deployment. Concsription with the basic four-week course, increasing self-contained food production, oil production from the North Sea, divert all fuel supplies to military forces based along the Western Coast and deploy hundreds of land-to-sea and surface-to-air missile stations.

Bring back any forces from outside of the UK, beg for help from Ex-Empire forces and just fortify the entire Western Coast as best as possible whilst using small units to attempt to cripple key areas within the US. The Whitehouse, Pentagon, etc. Granted, incredibly difficult, but the only way to effectively cut off the head of American invading forces.

Oh, we'd try. But what can we do? America's forces outnumber us on every front. The Unite States Marines Corps is the smallest military force they have, and its still larger then our combined military forces.

Seaborne, Airborne and Groundborne forces are just far too numerous for us to contend with. We'd give the landing forces a huge black eye, but we'd never win.

Yes, quite.   In fairness, they'd try not to kill many of us. I would say we'd just become another State. We're much more use to them alive then we are completely eradicated. We'd just be annexed into American soil.

Would you rather leave a huge, pissed off force that will keep attacking you feebly afterwards, or give them some measure of freedom, install a Senetor (most States vastly outsize the UK anyway) and just call them Americans?

Yes not to mention America's crazy military technology. I wouldn't be surprised if they invaded with invisible flying saucers and rayguns lol

Wow, didn't know the US Marines was bigger than all our armed forces combined. I heard a story about the US Coast Guard being bigger than the Royal Navy but I dunno if that's true too lol

Ah well Britain had to end one day.

 
Would you rather leave a huge, pissed off force that will keep attacking you feebly afterwards, or give them some measure of freedom, install a Senator

 

Dejavu ?

 

Why does America never annex anywhere? It reminds me of the old Mali Empire which preferred to keep puppet states at it's peripheries rather than outright annexation. America has plenty. Pakistan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Britain

Tbh America has already taken over. they got fat military bases here, their companies run our economy, they get first dibs on our resources etc.

We've all seen what happens to countries that do not cooperate with America (Syria, Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan)
 
 
 
British officials consider contingency options to back up a possible US action as fears mount over Tehran's capability

Every country does this. The UK would be stupid not to plan for any eventuality

 

I just said its a possibility and the UK are planning for it, you just repeated what i said basically

I understand that our head of state could take over the government if she saw fit? Could she do that in other countries where shes head of state like canada and get them on the americans?
 
 
 
Deja vu.

&quot;Look, they got WMDs!! They must be stopped!&quot;
&lt;10 years later, rubble, millions dead&gt;

&quot;...maybe they haven't but that's not why we went in &lt;insert an unimaginative excuse, usually involving humanitarian aid (ignoring the ones killed, sorry 'bout those) and the need for democracy&gt;&quot;

 

This is incredibly different to Iraq. For one there is reliable evidence from neutral organisations saying that they are basically pursuing a bomb

Its possible, I suppose. But I'm afraid the Canadian Prime Minister would have to approve military action. And S/He'd never do that. Canada has a very strong helicopter combat force, its helicopter training is arguably the best in the world. But even that is paled in comparison to the American force, even with its lesser training.

Hypothetically, Canada could do a very good job distracting them, but ultimately I doubt most Nations would want to side against America. We haven't the means to invade America with any great effect, either. We have arguably the best special forces on the planet, as well as highly trained specialist forces like the Royal Marines who can operate effectively in all conditions. If we sent them over, America would have to concern itsself with eradicating the interior threats first.

Attacking targets of high value, attempting to capture the President and/or the other Joint Chiefs of Staff, Generals, etc. Sabotage, assassinations, ambushes. We'd be much more effective as a hit and run force, rather then a defensive one.
With Canada's help at the North, and if we managed to raise some support from the British Commonwealth, in the smallest of chances we may well be able to win. Not through direct destruction of all enemy forces, and I imagine that the American Forces and its people would have something very big to say about us capturing or killing their Leadership, but we technically could win via that method.

The Union Jack over the Whitehouse?

Its about time. Damn upstart colonials.
 
 
 
Would't be worth it tbh, America would be a bitch to occupy

 

Exactly. Every damn movement we make would be reported, convoys hit with greater effect, supplies restricted and huge coups from the American Military as well as mass riots in the streets. We simply don't have the man power to contain all of that. Unless we had help, I don't know how much Russia still resents the Americans, but I know there are no tensions between us and them. I doubt the Russian PM and President would be all that unhappy about taking over American assets, actually.

But yes, you're quite right. An occupation of America, even in the slimmest chance as it is, would simply be unholdable. One would be foolish to look past America's patriotism, and how most believe they are the rightful master country. They've tasted British occupation before, and it didn't taste nice.

 
Its about time. Damn upstart colonials.

 

Haha, quite.

I got a fantastic Email from my Dad a long time back about an Email from the Queen to President Bush, telling him how the British were going to take back over, they'd let the country be theirs long enough and they'd made a mess of both the English Language and International Affairs. I'll try and find it, because it is a great laugh.

TO MY AMERICAN SUBJECTS!:

THE QUEEN HAS SENT YOU AN EMAIL

To the citizens of the United States of America from Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.

In light of your immediate failure to financially manage yourselves and also in recent years your tendency to elect incompetent Presidents of the USA and therefore not able to govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your independence, effective immediately. (You should look up 'revocation' in the Oxford English Dictionary.)

Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchical duties over all states, commonwealths, and territories (except Kansas, which she does not fancy).

Your new Prime Minister, David Cameron, will appoint a Governor for America without the need for further elections.

Congress and the Senate will be disbanded. A questionnaire may be circulated sometime next year to determine whether any of you noticed.

To aid in the transition to a British Crown dependency, the following rules are introduced with immediate effect:

1. The letter 'U' will be reinstated in words such as 'colour,' 'favour,' 'labour' and 'neighbour.' Likewise, you will learn to spell 'doughnut' without skipping half the letters, and the suffix '-ize' will be replaced by the suffix '-ise.' Generally, you will be expected to raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels. (look up 'vocabulary').
------------------------
2. Using the same twenty-seven words interspersed with filler noises such as ''like' and 'you know' is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication. There is no such thing as U.S. English. We will let Microsoft know on your behalf. The Microsoft spell-checker will be adjusted to take into account the reinstated letter 'u'' and the elimination of '-ize.'
-------------------
3. July 4th will no longer be celebrated as a holiday.
-----------------
4. You will learn to resolve personal issues without using guns, lawyers, or therapists. The fact that you need so many lawyers and therapists shows that you're not quite ready to be independent. Guns should only be used for shooting grouse. If you can't sort things out without suing someone or speaking to a therapist, then you're not ready to shoot grouse.
----------------------
5. Therefore, you will no longer be allowed to own or carry anything more dangerous than a vegetable peeler. Although a permit will be required if you wish to carry a vegetable peeler in public.
----------------------
6. All intersections will be replaced with roundabouts, and you will start driving on the left side with immediate effect. At the same time, you will go metric with immediate effect and without the benefit of conversion tables. Both roundabouts and metrication will help you understand the British sense of humour.
--------------------
7. The former USA will adopt UK prices on petrol (which you have been calling gasoline) of roughly $10/US gallon. Get used to it.
-------------------
8. You will learn to make real chips. Those things you call French fries are not real chips, and those things you insist on calling potato chips are properly called crisps. Real chips are thick cut, fried in animal fat, and dressed not with catsup but with vinegar.
-------------------
9. The cold, tasteless stuff you insist on calling beer is not actually beer at all. Henceforth, only proper British Bitter will be referred to as beer, and European brews of known and accepted provenance will be referred to as Lager. New Zealand beer is also acceptable, as New Zealand is pound for pound the greatest sporting nation on earth and it can only be due to the beer. They are also part of the British Commonwealth - see what it did for them. American brands will be referred to as Near-Frozen Gnat's Urine, so that all can be sold without risk of further confusion.
---------------------
10. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as good guys. Hollywood will also be required to cast English actors to play English characters. Watching Andie Macdowell attempt English dialogue in Four Weddings and a Funeral was an experience akin to having one's ears removed with a cheese grater.
---------------------
11. You will cease playing American football. There are only two kinds of proper football; one you call soccer, and rugby (dominated by the New Zealanders). Those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to play rugby (which has some similarities to American football, but does not involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like a bunch of nancies).
---------------------
12. Further, you will stop playing baseball. It is not reasonable to host an event called the World Series for a game which is not played outside of America. Since only 2.1% of you are aware there is a world beyond your borders, your error is understandable. You will learn cricket, and we will let you face the Australians (World dominators) first to take the sting out of their deliveries.
--------------------
13. You must tell us who killed JFK. It's been driving us mad.
-----------------
14. An internal revenue agent (i.e. tax collector) from Her Majesty's Government will be with you shortly to ensure the acquisition of all monies due (backdated to 1776).
---------------
15. Daily Tea Time begins promptly at 4 p.m. with proper cups, with saucers, and never mugs, with high quality biscuits (cookies) and cakes; plus strawberries (with cream) when in season.

God Save the Queen!
 
 
 
They plan for everything and this is a contingency plan we are not about to invade Iran

 

When did i say we were about to invade Iran?
 
 
 
How do you win?

That's exactly what we thought when we went into Iraq and Afghanistan.

 

I believe we knew the score when we were going into Afghanistan and Iraq. We were going into countries where there would be lots of guerrilla warfare, and in Iraqs case sectarian violence that had been held back for decades. Iran actually has, in my opinion, got some semi-viable opposition to the current government, along with lots of the public who want that.
 
 
 
Why should our people die protecting israel when they wont listen to us when we ask them to stop going too far in their treatment of palestine? Its about time our help came with the condition of them not exacerbating the situation with white phosphorus and the like.

 

The Palestinians use them as well.

That's what we thought with iraq. We believed that the people wanted us. We were wrong. We're wrong here as well.

The first time they did. If we had stuck around to sort it out then, we would have been sorted. However, when we came back a second time - after they had been persecuted following supporting us before, they kept their heads down and didn't get involved.
 
 
 
Will Iran be attacked? - Yes. Will UK be active in that - Unsure.

Yes, Iran can not be trusted with WMD's.

 

I think you got brainwashed by the "western" media.
 
 
 
This is incredibly different to Iraq. For one there is reliable evidence from neutral organisations saying that they are basically pursuing a bomb

 

What evidence? they said the same with iraq and i didn't see any weps of mass destruction which were supposedly in iraq.

There is more evidence against Israel's WMDs, heck even North Korea. Perhaps there are other motives at play here? This is more about politics and resources.

Funny, Iran has never invaded a foreign country in recent history (it's normally the British and Americans doing that). I can see far more aggressive countries out there.

This is the culmination of years upon years of anti-Iran propaganda by our politicians and the media outlets. The political runnings of the country are none of our business. The nuclear issue stinks of double standards. Israel, India, Pakistan all helped by the West to develop these weapons under the radar. If it's an arms race, guess who triggered that?

in Iraq they did actually find   yellow cake uranium  as well as   nerve agents . Obviously this is nothing like the claims that Bush made and likely fabricated but to say they found nothing is false.

I'd much rather live with Western nuclear hypocrisy than a nuclear arms race in the Middle East that this will inevitable kick off, with the area flooded with nuclear material how long till terrorists get hold of it or there is some form of limited exchange? Oh and Pakistan practically stole their nuclear program they were not helped by the West

Well, hypocrites are in no position to tell other people how to live their lives nor would they listen.

The arms race in that region is due to Israel, who we unconditionally support. We couldn't list their crimes, far too long, and they are the epitome of aggression (invading neighbours, strangling Palestinians, land grabbing and stealing homes, building inhumane walls etc etc).

No its not. There is no arms race right now. The only country pursuing nukes is Iran, and if they manage it a whole load of other countries including Saudi Arabia will pursue nukes, others will likely ask for assurances from America that they have their protection.

The Middle East will be a far worse place with a nuclear armed Iran. I don't really think any nation in the area apart from Syria and Iran care much about the Israeli nuke. Pakistan only pursued nukes because India had them.

Pakistan got them because of india...now Iran wants them because of Israel. Makes sense. Supplying Israel with nukes is the main reason for this instability. What people in the West don't seem to fathom is that Israel gets away with murder on all fronts and there are no repercussions. Iran has a nuclear neighbour thanks to us.
 
 
 
Mark my words. No other country will attack Iran except for Israel, with perhaps military support in terms of intelligence from the US/UK. The UK does not have the means to carry out an attack on Iran. - Forget the fact that the US/UK/NATO would never get the support from the international community to carry out an attack. Israel? They can do what they want.

I don't think the girl in yo sig is that hot.

Iran can't be trusted. I don't think we will go to war with them any time soon. I don't think the US, or any of the countries surrounding it, will either.

And some of the **** in this thread is retarded.

Israel having nuclear weapons is, I'd argue, a large part of their not being overrun by countries led by ****ing maniacs that can't seem to realise that their ideas for fixing a 'problem' are essentially the same as all the stuff that created the very ****ing problem.

I'm not pro Jew or Arab, but the Arabs seem to have a ****ing monopoly on stupidity and bull****, butthurt reactionary nonsense when it comes down to it.

I pity the people of Iran that are educated/intelligent enough to realise how ****ed their country has and is becoming, and there seems to be a fair few of them.
 
 
Only time shall tell...
 
 
I hope no one attacks Iran, despite all the hype from Western governments and media it's one of the most progressive countries in Asia, and I'd argue one of the most progressive countries in the world if the Religious clerics didn't have a hold on the government given that Ahmadinejad holds probably the most liberal values of any Islamic country, with an example of that being that enrollment of women into some university subjects such as medicine (which is a predominantly male profession in the middle east) was so high that they had to reduce that number so there was a 50/50 gender split.

If we should invade anywhere then it should be Israel as they are a serious risk to the middle east combined with oppressing the people of Palestine, and they actually do have nukes, while Iran is only at the research stage of nuclear energy and there is no reason to suspect that they are making nuclear bombs other than to defend themselves after 40 years of oppression from the US and Israel despite either being on the same side or introverted during that time.
 
 
 
Us? Again no one gave Israel nukes they developed them themselves. At one point stealing uranium from the US. Iran has managed the last 40 or so years without nukes and has a big enough conventional army and missile capacity to ward off Israel, they have no need of nukes.

 

The US blatantly supplied them. They've practically equipped Israel's entire military. This is quite well known. No theft was involved, and even if it was, where were the repercussions? Double standards again.*

Who cares about double standards? Lets say a nuclear exchange occurs between Iran and Saudi Arabia or Israel, are you going to turn around and say oh well at least we weren't hypocrites? Or lets say Iran lets some terrorist cell get hold of a dirty bomb and they go and kill 10 thousand people then what?

This is hardly a game. Fact is some nations can be trusted with nukes and other can't and a bunch of religious fanatics who think God is on their side are not the people you want to have nukes. Yes Israel having nukes is not a good thing and they should't have been allowed to get them however that battle is long gone. The best we can do is stop any other countries getting nukes.

Oh and do some research into the Israeli nuclear program and you might see just how filled with deceit it is.

"The CIA believed that Israel's first bombs may have been made with highly enriched uranium stolen in the mid-1960s from the US Navy nuclear fuel plant operated by the Nuclear Materials and Equipment Corporation, where sloppy material accounting would have masked the theft.[47][48]

Israel's nuclear capability is phenomenal. They didn't get this far without state help. The French started it but you can call it US incompetence, either way they assisted the development. You say this battle is long gone but it was only within the last 50 years. The bottom line is they were allowed implicitly to develop nukes.

The double standards and hypocrisy issue matters. It signals the West has different, hidden motives. It has a secret club that gets preferential treatment. It also matters in getting support for a war, in confidence. Credibility and integrity matters in international relations and it's one of the main reasons why we find countries like Iran uncooperative.

Do you not find it odd how many of these conflicts are created by the West and then conveniently the West offer to fix them? The existence of Israel for one, Iraq...

You don't seem to understand - Iran is a much more difficult country to attack. They have a good military, probably nuclear capabilities, an ego-maniac of a leader and a very high population of supporters. We wouldn't be able to 'win' a war there. Only an idiot would invade it.

 Well said.

There are two sides to this statement. One is right, one is wrong.

Could military action lead by the US and the UK with a few other allies in there defeat and decimate the Iranian Armed Forces? Yes. It wouldn't be the easiest or quickest thing in the world, but yes, such a combined force definitely could. There are precious few places on earth that they couldn't reduce to smoking rubble, frankly.

However, a ground assault [+ occupation and long term rebuild without any real indigenous assistance in the political lanscape] would be nigh on impossible to achieve and you'd be right in saying it pretty much couldn't be done.
 
 
 
 

 

 

oops  
 
 
 
The US blatantly supplied them. They've practically equipped Israel's entire military. This is quite well known. No theft was involved, and even if it was, where were the repercussions? Double standards again.*

 

Ahh, well actually that's somewhat incorrect. Yes, America supplied Israel with much of its airforce and yes, many firearms were indeed sent to Israel from American arms industries. However, much of Israel's military was created off its own back.

The IDF have many of their own weapon, vehicle and ammuniton manufacturies, which are in no way associated with American Defence Armaments. The Tavor, for example, is one of Israel's most famous firearms. But it also constructed its own tanks (the Merkava, Magach, Sho't, Isherman and the Sabra), Armoured Personal Carriers (Nagmachon, Nakpadon, Achzarit, Namer, Wolf and Golan), SPAs (Ro'Em, Makmat, MAR-240, Sholef and the Rascal) and Aircraft.

They have armed a much higher percentage of their forces then the Americans have. I am not going to get involved in the Nuclear side, I would say that America has had some backdoor deals done with Israel over the Nuclear Arms, but for their conventional equipment, Israel has armed much of itself over its own back.
 
 
 
Us? Again no one gave Israel nukes they developed them themselves. At one point stealing uranium from the US. Iran has managed the last 40 or so years without nukes and has a big enough conventional army and missile capacity to ward off Israel, they have no need of nukes.

 

That'll all come in handy when Israel are firing their nukes Iran's way  

I don't trust any country, including my own. Some scare me more than others. Iran uneases me, but Israel - well they really scare me.

No one can be trusted with WMDs, and there are much worse countries than Iran which already have WMDs.

Or from another standpoint, thinking they have WMDs and look how Iraq turned out.

Of course some countries can be trusted.

Mainly countries that dont desire for another country to be wiped of the face of the earth.

In which case why would they need WMD's?

WMD's are either an offensive weapon, which is a topic you didn't include, or a defensive weapon, in which case it would be for defending its own country, not another one, which would be a good argument for Iran having WMDs.

they've been silent against US and Israeli harassment for 40 years combined with not being involved in any wars which didn't involve protecting their own land.

How is that no cause and how does that make them likely to use them?

I'm someone who has researched this issue considerably including doing an Extended Project on the matter so I'm fairly sure I'm more versed in it than you are, so how exactly am I stupid when you're the one dismissing basic evidence?
 
 
I would hope the UK MI5/6 counterintelligence would be preparing for an Iranian attack... here in the UK. Iran will try its damnedest now to launch a terrorist strike against UK interests; either here or abroad through some 3rd party. This is their modus operandi.

Lol, don't you worry about that, the only attacks that IRR orchestrates in this country are against Iranian dissidents and the past 32 years have shown that MI5 seem pretty good at turning a blind eye to it all  

Al Qaeda style 7/7 attacks are not IRR's style. Fighting covertly, by proxy is and with diversionary tactics is.

Here, thought you might appreciate this as well.  

TO MY AMERICAN SUBJECTS!:

THE QUEEN HAS SENT YOU AN EMAIL

To the citizens of the United States of America from Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.

In light of your immediate failure to financially manage yourselves and also in recent years your tendency to elect incompetent Presidents of the USA and therefore not able to govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your independence, effective immediately. (You should look up 'revocation' in the Oxford English Dictionary.)

Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchical duties over all states, commonwealths, and territories (except Kansas, which she does not fancy).

Your new Prime Minister, David Cameron, will appoint a Governor for America without the need for further elections.

Congress and the Senate will be disbanded. A questionnaire may be circulated sometime next year to determine whether any of you noticed.

To aid in the transition to a British Crown dependency, the following rules are introduced with immediate effect:

1. The letter 'U' will be reinstated in words such as 'colour,' 'favour,' 'labour' and 'neighbour.' Likewise, you will learn to spell 'doughnut' without skipping half the letters, and the suffix '-ize' will be replaced by the suffix '-ise.' Generally, you will be expected to raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels. (look up 'vocabulary').
------------------------
2. Using the same twenty-seven words interspersed with filler noises such as ''like' and 'you know' is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication. There is no such thing as U.S. English. We will let Microsoft know on your behalf. The Microsoft spell-checker will be adjusted to take into account the reinstated letter 'u'' and the elimination of '-ize.'
-------------------
3. July 4th will no longer be celebrated as a holiday.
-----------------
4. You will learn to resolve personal issues without using guns, lawyers, or therapists. The fact that you need so many lawyers and therapists shows that you're not quite ready to be independent. Guns should only be used for shooting grouse. If you can't sort things out without suing someone or speaking to a therapist, then you're not ready to shoot grouse.
----------------------
5. Therefore, you will no longer be allowed to own or carry anything more dangerous than a vegetable peeler. Although a permit will be required if you wish to carry a vegetable peeler in public.
----------------------
6. All intersections will be replaced with roundabouts, and you will start driving on the left side with immediate effect. At the same time, you will go metric with immediate effect and without the benefit of conversion tables. Both roundabouts and metrication will help you understand the British sense of humour.
--------------------
7. The former USA will adopt UK prices on petrol (which you have been calling gasoline) of roughly $10/US gallon. Get used to it.
-------------------
8. You will learn to make real chips. Those things you call French fries are not real chips, and those things you insist on calling potato chips are properly called crisps. Real chips are thick cut, fried in animal fat, and dressed not with catsup but with vinegar.
-------------------
9. The cold, tasteless stuff you insist on calling beer is not actually beer at all. Henceforth, only proper British Bitter will be referred to as beer, and European brews of known and accepted provenance will be referred to as Lager. New Zealand beer is also acceptable, as New Zealand is pound for pound the greatest sporting nation on earth and it can only be due to the beer. They are also part of the British Commonwealth - see what it did for them. American brands will be referred to as Near-Frozen Gnat's Urine, so that all can be sold without risk of further confusion.
---------------------
10. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as good guys. Hollywood will also be required to cast English actors to play English characters. Watching Andie Macdowell attempt English dialogue in Four Weddings and a Funeral was an experience akin to having one's ears removed with a cheese grater.
---------------------
11. You will cease playing American football. There are only two kinds of proper football; one you call soccer, and rugby (dominated by the New Zealanders). Those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to play rugby (which has some similarities to American football, but does not involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like a bunch of nancies).
---------------------
12. Further, you will stop playing baseball. It is not reasonable to host an event called the World Series for a game which is not played outside of America. Since only 2.1% of you are aware there is a world beyond your borders, your error is understandable. You will learn cricket, and we will let you face the Australians (World dominators) first to take the sting out of their deliveries.
--------------------
13. You must tell us who killed JFK. It's been driving us mad.
-----------------
14. An internal revenue agent (i.e. tax collector) from Her Majesty's Government will be with you shortly to ensure the acquisition of all monies due (backdated to 1776).
---------------
15. Daily Tea Time begins promptly at 4 p.m. with proper cups, with saucers, and never mugs, with high quality biscuits (cookies) and cakes; plus strawberries (with cream) when in season.

God Save the Queen!

Depends on the nature of the attacks, if its just one guy coming in killing someone then leaving its very difficult to stop it or even realize that its a political assassination not just a normal murder
 
 
 
They plan for everything and this is a contingency plan we are not about to invade Iran

They wouldnt. Theyd kill the Palestinians and totally destroy important islamic historical sites. They want them in order to remove the nuclear option from Israels table. The US told Israel that them having nukes would start a regional arms race and as usual they wouldnt listen.

 
During the 1960s, US inspectors visited Dimona several times but were unable to obtain an accurate picture of the activities carried out there.

GlobalSecurity.org says the Israelis went so far as to install false control room panels and to brick over elevators and hallways that accessed certain areas of the facility.

The inspectors were able to report that there was no clear scientific research or civilian nuclear power programme justifying such a large reactor - seen as circumstantial evidence of the Israeli bomb programme - but found no evidence of "weapons-related activities".

I read in a sunday paper that UK forces will not attack Iran.

I now know that I need to dig a bunker in my parents back garden and get myself a large slab of lead because quite frankly, this world is going to go tits up within 2 years at this rate.
 
 
i don know, is it really neccessory 4 iran to be attacked?
i mean, things are really messed up in here.quiet big scandals every day. people are not satisfied with the government. its like a dictatorship system.
so, U C people on one side, and the country leaders on another. BUT war will hurt all. a lot of damage, unneeded damage will be done. is it really necessory? AND, another thing. we have a LOT of wars in the world. libia, iraq, afqanistan, and if we add IRAN, then everything gets messed up.

I agree, it is strategic diplomatic tool rather than a potential military tool. Iran is much less militarily aggressive than the Western powers give it credit for. But it is extremely politically and diplomatically aggressive, but no more so than the Western powers. That's why it's seen as such a threat, because unlike other "enemy states", Iran is actually very effective in its efforts to influence events outside its borders. Can't really say the same for North Korea or Cuba.

Not only is it objectively unnecessary to adopt a military solution in Iran, but it would strategically be a very bad decision.

gud, iran guys insulted us so we shud attack em, i wud if i were PM, iran needs to keep its people under control!
 
 
 
It shouldn't be as bad as Afghanistan. Fingers crossed it will just be a conventional war - go in, win, install a government that is friendlier, go home. Rather than having to stick around fighting those who can't take the fact they lost. Then again that is the Arab way, so who knows?!

 

The UK would get owned in a conventional war with Iran.
 
 
Anyone who really thinks Iran so big of a threat that war is our only option needs to calm the **** down. Stop being so gullible, Ahmedijawhatever talks a load of bull. If his threats scare you enough to want to go to war you need a reality check (this goes to the US too)! Iran is a middle-level power with a very unpopular/dysfunctional government. The US already helped Iran by getting rid of saddam/taliban leaving Iran with no natural enemies. The Iranian "threat" is incredibly over-hyped... Iran's GPD is roughly that of the US state of Florida... so clearly Iran is not a dominant world power. Iran's defence expenditures (around 20 billion dollars) adds up to roughly 3 months budget of US's operations in Iraq. Most of Iran’s expenditures are spent on defence equipment even though they lack heavy lift; heavy amour and long ring strike aircraft. Looks like Iran can only operate through terrorism... but it doesn't seem likely.

The Iranian army is much much larger than Britains. They are also pretty well trained and not likely to run up the white flag at the first sign of trouble. Plus of course the British army is already stretched to a maximum so it's unlikely they could pull together much of a force.

Our population sizes are similar (although they have 10 million more people), and our spend on military is far higher. We have better trained troops, and better equipment. We would win hands down in a conventional war, let alone before Israel and America gets involved. I'm not saying it would be easy alone, but definitely doable.

Population size has nothing to do with it because 66 million Brits are not about to rise up and attack 77 million Iranians in hand to hand combat.

The Iranian army for proper has 465,000. The Revolutionary Guards have another 120,000 and there are also perhaps 3 million deployable irregulars in the form of the Basij. So, that's a total of 3,585,000.

The British Army has 110,000 regulars are 33,000 territorials, so a total of 143,000. About 41,000 are currently deployed overseas so that leaves 102,000. Take off 20% at any one time who are not fit for combat and lets keep 20,000 at home in case the frogs decide to invade and you are left with about 62,000 to embark on a war with Iran.

Technology and training are all well and good but I'd say the odds were well and truly stacked against Tommy Atkins. Plus of course Iran would be playing at home.

If we went to war with Iran on our own, our military would have to be expanded and we would probably have to start conscription all over again. I wasn't saying in our current condition we could win. But that's why we would always go in as a unified group. If we went in with Israel and America doing most of the heavy lifting it would be reasonable easy. I can't envisage a situation that would lead to the UK trying to do it solo really...

Sounds like you are backsliding drastically because you said

"We would win hands down in a conventional war, let alone before Israel and America gets involved" and expressed the opinion that going it alone was "definately doable"

You're now saying we'd need to reintroduce conscription and have America and Israel "do all the heavy lifting" Bit of a u turn non?
 
 
 
We are talking about conventional warfare here. Not guerrilla warfare. I am well aware that a band of around 1000 men can easily continue to fight in urban or hostile environments almost indefinitely, especially with Islam behind them as a unifying force.

 

Well, there would likely be a heavy mix of both conventional and guerrilla warfare, and Britain would fare badly on both fronts.

Am sure, hypothetically speaking, the Israelis would be thinking the exact same thing, just with Britain in its place doing the heavy lifting work.

You do seem to be acknowledging Britain's inability to really pull this off on its own.

I think we could mobilise far quicker than this... We would probably use a destroy everything of value to the enemy strategy and not need to expand that much any way. We could have all their infrastructure, signally, and weapony destroyed with relative ease, whilst they couldn't reach our soil.
 
 
Defo looks like theyre gearing up for war and it all depends who's side china Russia and DPRK take.
It's good to see the Iranians shot down a US drone anyway!

In this case in a conventional war, we have the technology to beat Iran's army without even taking fire. Unless we start fighting in close quarters, I don't see how the Iranian's are going to fire back. Their armoured force is obsolete, their air force is obsolete and you could probably say most of their equipment is dated. In conventional warfare Iran's military would be very easy to destroy, however of course inside cities or urban combat is another thing. But out in the terrain which Iran has, I'm pretty damn sure the UK military would dominate, if it focused its entire force on Iran.

Not only that, we could enforce a naval blockade on Iran, take out all its oil pumping capabilities and essentially sever the army communications via the use of tomahawk missiles.

While it wouldn't be easy, the UK military certainly would not get owned if it had the full force behind it.

They aren't any where near as rich as we are? They aren't as technologically competant. If it was a conventional war we've got enough firepower in the air, and from the sea, to totally destroy all their forces.
 
 
 
But "destroying" all this is not going to mean you'd win. This was the NATO strategy in Yugoslavia, and it didn't result in NATO "winning"

 

It increases the likelyhood dramatically though. Once the forces cannot communicate, and become bands of men just fighting for the sake of it, it soon starts to unravel. An army that isn't fighting in unison is a much weaker army.

And probably trigger a global economic crisis that would be certain to bring down many Western economies (who may go down he drain anyway without such an additional crisis). Not only will shutting down the 4th largest oil producer trigger massive increases in oil prices, but the knock-on instability into the oil producing nations westwards (from the action itself, but also direct Iranian incitement; they have extensive operations and intelligence networks through the Middle East) would be catastrophic.

Their economy is far more stable and secure than ours is, and it's stability and security that matters.
 
 
Iran just downed a U.S. drone using e-countermeasures. It uses the same stealth technology as the B2 Bomber so maybe they can bring one of those down too. Worrying stuff.

It's good to see the Iranians shot down a US drone anyway!

 

China, Russia and the DPRK will not get involved.

China is too focussed on its' economy to wade into costly, needless conflicts. It follows isolationist policies, and wouldn't consider Iran important enough to jeopardise relations with the West. They might be trading partners, and China might be more sympathetic than Israel and the US - but the Balance of Power would be irreparably damaged if they had a war-by-proxy with America.

Russia is still controlled by Putin. Putin is suffering in the pre-election polls and although it is almost certain will emerge victorious, he will not risk losing even more popularity. Secondly, as with China, Russia follows a relatively isolationist policy - although has closer military links with Iran. Its seat on the UN Security Council might taper its temper in this matter, and Russia doesn't need Iran's oil - it has enough of its own.

North Korea is just so ronery. China wouldn't allow it to get involved.

There's no evidence that the drone was shot down by the Iranians - you can't take the word of some "official" as gospel.  

This shouldn't escalate into some "all-in" conflict. Israel will not allow the Iranian nuclear sites to develop, and it will use its air power to deal with them. That said, the Iranian response is very unpredictable. Hopefully, a string of anti-Semitic rhetoric will be the worst that comes of it... but if the Ayatollah gets his turban in a twist, there may well be a more aggressive response. Both Israel and Iran have significant conventional military strength, but Israel's nuclear weapons might hopefully dissuade Iran from a retaliation.

Their economy appears stable to you, but it is heavily dependent on oil. Once we have made sure they don't have the means to export it, their economy would essentially collapse. Our economy is also over 4x the size of theirs. So in terms of economic might we would stomp all over them.

By the time we hit the ground many of their men would be dead, they'd have next to no artilary to speak of, and they would be in disarray. We don't have to wipe them out to cause the army to switch sides here. By the time we had any boots on the ground, it would just be a case of sweeping in and finishing the job.

Of course the Taliban can communicate... but they are 36,000 strong and communicate infrequently between cells. If we had all of them stood against us in a conventional battle, we would win in less than 3 days, and probably lose less than 100 men. If we reduced the Iranian armies communication capabilities down to those levels, it would be much much easier because they wouldn't have very direct command from above.

You are debating with someone who specialised in military strategy in their history degree by the way.

No one said anything about winning. I was actually responding to someone who stated that Britain's military would get "owned" in a military conflict with Iran. I'm just stating that the full force of Britain's military capabilities could wipe the floor of Iran who are still using F-14 Eagle's in their air force.  
 
 
Seriously. How are we going to attack Iran with a half built aircraft carrier and what's left of the army tied up in Afghanistan.

I just don't understand. Iran, legitimately, wants nuclear weapons to be able to defend itself against aggressive powers like Israel. As soon as they attempt to have them, which is well within their rights, we shout war, war, lets fight another war, lets help America, war, lets kill, kill, kill, all the time when we are wanting to fight a war on terror. It's so stupid.

On the China vs America debate - America only have to lose a tiny tiny amount to 'lose' the war. THe people with power in America simply aren't used to any sort of suffering. Chinese people are. Also the American and Chinese economies are completely interdependent.

On the how will it effect us (in Britain), imagine 7/7 most weeks all over the country.
 
 
 
Their economy appears stable to you, but it is heavily dependent on oil. Once we have made sure they don't have the means to export it, their economy would essentially collapse. Our economy is also over 4x the size of theirs. So in terms of economic might we would stomp all over them.

By the time we hit the ground many of their men would be dead, they'd have next to no artilary to speak of, and they would be in disarray. We don't have to wipe them out to cause the army to switch sides here. By the time we had any boots on the ground, it would just be a case of sweeping in and finishing the job.

Of course the Taliban can communicate... but they are 36,000 strong and communicate infrequently between cells. If we had all of them stood against us in a conventional battle, we would win in less than 3 days, and probably lose less than 100 men. If we reduced the Iranian armies communication capabilities down to those levels, it would be much much easier because they wouldn't have very direct command from above.

You are debating with someone who specialised in military strategy in their history degree by the way.

 

Do you really think that the Iranian's don't have hundreds of people specialising in military strategy who have worked exceptionally hard to make sure the situation is not like you've described lol :roll eyes:

Nuclear weapons are not a right. Iran is signed up to a treaty that says they will not develop nukes. They do not need nukes to defend themselves, their military and the proxies they control in the area is enough to deter any invader even the US.

They can theorise all the want, but we would dismantle any defence they could possible erect. Ah, the joys of superior military capability  
 
 
 
So is allowing an Iranian nuke. Stuck between a rock and a hard place

 

true, but not enough. isnt there any other ways? like, U know, north corea is always more dangerous than Iran. but we let them be free anytime.
AND, theres no ensurance that iranian government doesnt have the nuclar's right now, and no ensurace that they wouldnt use it while "defending" themselves!

 
Their economy is far more stable and secure than ours is, and it's stability and security that matters.

 

the stability?? iran? dude. everything is falling down about economy here. like i said; scandals, bankrupts, LOT of bankrupts. bad inflation; any governmental staff is dying with no money. THERE IS NO stability.

 
Iran just downed a U.S. drone using e-countermeasures. It uses the same stealth technology as the B2 Bomber so maybe they can bring one of those down too. Worrying stuff.

 

dont believe what you hear. most of the things that iranian government say's is fake. totally.

 
The Iranian army is much much larger than Britains. They are also pretty well trained and not likely to run up the white flag at the first sign of trouble. Plus of course the British army is already stretched to a maximum so it's unlikely they could pull together much of a force.

 

it IS larger. but we all know it. quality vs. quantity! you might have an army of 1 milion empty-handed soldiors, but 100 tanks can get over them. its easy. iranian army is not proffesional but UK's is- done.

North Korea is kept in line by China and is hardly free, it is pretty much barred from the entire international community, and they do whatever they want. Just look at the fact they bomb South Korea and sink their ships.

agreed. but, the part i meant they cannot do anything, was nuking - U know, they threat alot of times that they will, but they are controlled.
 
 
 
In this case in a conventional war, we have the technology to beat Iran's army without even taking fire. Unless we start fighting in close quarters, I don't see how the Iranian's are going to fire back. Their armoured force is obsolete, their air force is obsolete and you could probably say most of their equipment is dated. In conventional warfare Iran's military would be very easy to destroy, however of course inside cities or urban combat is another thing. But out in the terrain which Iran has, I'm pretty damn sure the UK military would dominate, if it focused its entire force on Iran.

Not only that, we could enforce a naval blockade on Iran, take out all its oil pumping capabilities and essentially sever the army communications via the use of tomahawk missiles.

While it wouldn't be easy, the UK military certainly would not get owned if it had the full force behind it.

 

Outdated equipment doesn't necessarily mean a definite "Rock-Paper-Scissors" loss. By that I mean just because one has equipment that is, by all intents and purposes, dated doesn't mean that it will inevitably fall to superior kit that, as you rightly say, we possess.

Look at the Taliban. AK-47s and RPGs as well as plastic tubs filled with explosives, and they still manage to kill hundreds of our Forces a year which utilise the most advanced vehicle hardware, light-weight body armour, firearms (even though the SA80 is just useless) and recon-units.

It doesn't matter if its a Challenger II or a Sherman. Destroy the tracks on a tank and it becomes a sitting duck. A duck with a 120mm rifled cannon, admitedly, but its immobile all the same.

Our airforce isn't that advanced. Flares and Chaff are still only 60% or so effective and we have nothing to protect against rapid fire, ground-based anti-air units.

Also, as for Tomohawks, this isn't necessarily a be all and end all either. The Iranians do have access to the Goalkeeper 20mm anti-missile system. Just like we use to protect our naval vessels and ground-based installations. The Dutch system is on par with America's Phalanx/Centurion systems, and more then capable of destroying a Tomohawk Cruise Missile.

We aren't completely certain to win a war like this on our own. A good chance, but that's why we call in aid from the rest of the Coalition.

But my point is, just because our spear is sharper then the Iranians, doesn't mean they aren't just as effective with theirs.

Iran's army is pretty professional actually. But putting that to one side, Britain's professional army has been well and truly caned several times before.
 
 
Basically if they attack Iran, I'll be 100ft underground eating cold baked beans if you want me. I doubt I'll get any signal so no point in texting/ emailing me xD

When?
 
 
 
When?

 

Got kicked out of the American colonies by a rag tag army and a bunch of farmers.
Got owned by a bunch of Boer farmers in South Africa
Afghanistan, 3 times (twice in the 19c and once in the 20c)
Caned by the Zulus in 1879
Beaten by Irish peasents at Castlebar

I am sure there are more but these spring instantly to mind.

Of course this is nothing to be ashamed of and not a reflection of a poor army. History is littered with examples of professional and technically advanced armies being routed by an unlikely opposition.

The British army beat the Continental Army in the majority of set peices. It was only when, you know, the French, the Spanish and the Dutch got involved and started raping the British supply lines accross the Atlanitc, that the tide began turning. The French, Spanish and Dutch were most certainly not a rag tag bunch of farmers.

 
Got owned by a bunch of Boer farmers in South Africa

 

Funny, I was under the distinct impression that Britain won, subjugated and conquered Orange and Transvaal.

 
Afghanistan, 3 times (twice in the 19c and once in the 20c)

 

The first war was a disaster yes, the second resulted in Afghanistan ceding it's foreign policy powers to the Raj, and the third war was Britain easily defeating an Afghan invasion of India.

 
Caned by the Zulus in 1879

 

Oh no, the British lost one single battle when they were outnumbered 20 to 1, heaven forbid  
It took the British just seven months to crush and conquer the Zulus. It was a decisive British victory with a casualty ratio of over 1:4, British:Zulu.

 
Beaten by Irish peasents at Castlebar

 

Yes, the French had absolutely nothing to do with that at all

I think Pol pot noodles dealt with all those quite well.

when you said the british had been defeated I thought you meant in living memory considering you were making comparison to the modern professional British army and the modern Iranian Army. Fact of the matter is we have experience, better hardware and superior training honed over hundreds of years (thats why armies around the world send officers to be trained at sandhurst). On our side.
 
 
 
China, Russia and the DPRK will not get involved.

China is too focussed on its' economy to wade into costly, needless conflicts. It follows isolationist policies, and wouldn't consider Iran important enough to jeopardise relations with the West.

 

China is isolationist as per it's self interest. China would only be too pleased to see the West embark on another crippling adventure in the Middle East, bringing forward the day it can be the assertive power in global geo-politics. You've got to admire China's patience.

I think they hold the same mentality as China, except Russia's leaders are deluded if they think they are ever going to be a global power again.

This is what the Iranian middle class think, because they are squeezed most by Ahmadhinejad's redistributive economic policies and punitive action against liberal contractors in the private sector, favouring conservative loyalists and firms connected with Pasdaran. The fact of the matter is that the Iranian economy continues to show very healthy growth in the face of the global downturn elsewhere. The existence of bankruptcies and inflation are not a symptom of economic downturn in themselves. Inflation of this level is actually very normal in thriving economies, and bankruptcies are a fact of life.
 
 
 
Their economy appears stable to you, but it is heavily dependent on oil. Once we have made sure they don't have the means to export it, their economy would essentially collapse.

 

You think this happens overnight? You think it can't all just go out through neutral Turkmenistan to China?

A war with Iran is far more likely to induce economic collapse here rather than there.

Ours is teetering on collapse as it is. Wonder what would happen with another war, especially with a relatively strong player like Iran

This is extraordinarily naive wishful thinking.

Firstly, the Taliban are able to perpetuate the menace in Afghanistan, in spite of 10 years of NATO presence. This is reality.

Secondly, there is no point hypothesising about "conventional warfare" with the Taliban, because this is never going to happen. Why would they agree to conventional warfare? It's hardly like Britain engages in conventional warfare either. It's like saying, if you gave the Taliban a parity in military technology, then they might engage in conventional warfare. Why would we? You judge success or failure in warfare by the reality and practicalities on the ground, not by unlikely hypothesis.

Lastly, our army has precious few in it with experience of conventional warfare (if you can count the Falklands as such warfare). Iran on the other hand does, with the last conventional war of our times being fought out for 8 years with the Iran-Iraq war. Ironically, this was a war that everybody in the West expected to be done and dusted in a matter of months, with the Western-backed and armed Iraq expecting a quick victory. Didn't happen. Iraq lost, the Islamic Republic got the rallying cause it needed to entrench and perpetuate itself, and the West looked very silly for underestimating Iran to such an astronomical degree.

bankrupts are the fact of life. BUT. country's first AND second car manufacturing companies (IRANKHODRO & SAIPA) were bankrupted. the biggest bank (MELLI bank) was almost too - and these are the basements in everyfield, considering that they are all governmental.

about the global downturn. well, it IS true, but why? because the country continue's very lonely, with no connection to most EU or american contries. but tjis caused the bad quality of stuff and country's low improvements.

Totally, I think that the economy system is really messed up - really dirty - in the country. i wonder if you've heard the 3 milion - and then 10milion - dollars defrauds BY THE GOVERNMENT PEOPLE. this shows how messed up everything is.

From what you write, the UK sounds a hell of a lot worse
 
 
 
A war with Iran is far more likely to induce economic collapse here rather than there.

 

How? The UK has a AAA credit rating, can afford to borrow, can step up exports and issue war bonds. It has the resources of the largest financial centre in the world through which to fund and resource any war.

 
Ours is teetering on collapse as it is. Wonder what would happen with another war, especially with a relatively strong player like Iran

 

The UK economy is not 'teetering' on the brink of collapse. It's, debatably, teetering on the brink of recession. It could be in recession for the next decade and would still be larger than Iran's.

What is the worst possible effect of this crisis? Economic collapse? I don't think so. Another recession? Maybe. That doesn't change the gact that the UK is and will always be wealthier than Iran. To suggest that Iran is in a more stable financial position than the UK is ridiculous. To suggest that Iran could in any way compete in a war against the UK is ridiculous.

A series of defaults in Europe could domino into the UK, and a trigger a collapsed banking system, and in effect a collapsed economy. People don't realise how indebted the economies are, and how a fine balance we are in at the moment.

Iran is already highly isolated with far less interdependence, which makes it more stable in some ways. It is oil dependent, which adds a specific type of instability, but oil prices tend to increase during crises (and the run up to them)
