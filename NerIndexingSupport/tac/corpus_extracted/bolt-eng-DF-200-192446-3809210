 
 
Would You Want to Work for MI6 (British Secret Intelligence Service) ?
 
 
Would you want to become James Bond (or a female equivalent if you're a girl)?  http://www.mi6.gov.uk/output/introduction.html 
Imagine the MI6 contacts you and says 'we think you'd be a perfect agent' and they'd want to post you to all sorts of countries and you'd get paid £20 k a month and your first mission would be to go to some Middle Eastern country to collect some vital intelligence while posing as an innocent uni student from Britain.
Would you take up this opportunity?

P.S. Remember what their website says about the criteria:

- You must be a British Citizen
- You will have to pass a medical and drugs test (haven't used Class A drugs (for example, Ecstasy, Cocaine etc) in the last 12 months and haven't used Class B/C drugs (for example, Amphetamines, Cannabis etc) in the last 6 months).
- You will need to be Security Cleared (PLEASE BE AWARE THAT IN ORDER TO OBTAIN DEVELOPED VETTING SECURITY CLEARANCE, YOU MUST BE OVER THE AGE OF 21 AT THE TIME OF ENTRY.)
- You will have to keep your identity secret from your family and friends and you understand that you will be made to "disappear" if you ever divulge to anyone that you're an agent for MI6 (lol!   the last 'criteria' is just a joke - take it easy! pheww!)
 
 
No I wouldn't want to. It sounds exciting, and the pay is amazing, but way too dangerous for me.

I'll just be content sitting at home and watching Chuck on telly  
 
 
Sure.
 
 
No, too dangerous for me!
 
 
Yes yes I sure would!
 
 
Didn't Aggie MacKenzie from "How Clean is your House" used to work for MI6?

I wouldn't fancy it myself. I'd rather be blissfully ignorant than be put under the stress of that sort of job.
 
 
Why not. It sounds good.
 
 
Not really. Not only would I be defending something I don't really believe in, but I also suspect that it's nowhere near as glamorous and interesting as popular culture would have use believe.
 
 
Umm it's more like £30k a year, you don't get to do anything like James Bond and it mainly involves a lot of paperwork (depending on what role you play)

Intelligence Officers for MI5 at least do a lot of paperwork and although get to venture outside, it mostly involves sitting in a van or an office tapping phones or driving around following someone. Fun for a while but I'd imagine the slightly naff pay and long hours would get to you...
 
 
Yeah, £20k a month sounds a bit steep though?!
 
 
Obviously it wouldn't be like James Bond. 20k a Month? Uhh - YES PLEASE!
 
 
What's the difference between MI5 and MI6?
 
 
you would have to blend in. A white man in the middle of the middle east is not the best of undercover work. Someone with good linguistic and intellegence is a plus

and 2 answer the question, then yes i am going to apply after career in the police/army
 
 
Are you sure they pay £20k a month?

I don't really know if I would or not. It'd be fascinating, no doubt about it, but I'd hate not to even be able to tell my mum anything. MI5 would probably be more my thing, although I may well change my mind later down the line.
 
 
It's not like being james bond.

But i'd love to work for 6 or 5.

Yes, with appropriate training, definitely.

Yeah and i think I would be good at the job since I can speak two languages, am asian so could fit in well with a 'black area' and wouldnt look too out of place in a 'white area'. I think i have some good qualities like i can lie quite well etc.
I really wanted to be part of mi6 after watching Spooks.

i would love to.. shame its in london. i applied to MI5, but never finished the application.

and MI5 is domestic, MI6 is international.

if you look on their site, there are vancancies for IT guys and admin staff mostly..
 
 
£20k a month? OP i think you are mistaken
 
 
i actually want to do this, im gonna go for it one day
 
 
No, it would be so much cooler to be a bad guy. Who wants to be boring and work for the gov

I think a lot of people in MI6 are ex-military. You have to pass loads of fitness tests if you're going to be a proper spy.

A WHOLE 2 LANGUAGES? **** YOU WERE BORN FOR THIS JOB!! and just so you know they probabaly dont give a toss about european languages as it is and want middle eastern/african dialect experts

I wasnt trying to brag or anything or say I should get it over someone else who only speaks one language.
And just so you know I speak bengali which isnt a european language last time I checked. I know they are looking for people who speak arabic, russian but hey atleast I speak another language.

Believe me, I am greatly lacking in general knowledge and common sense  

Spooks makes MI6 look really cool, but i'd be way to scared to do half of that stuff!
 
 
I would love it. My languages would let me down, and my driving, and I'd have to improve my fitness. I'd apply, but I'm probably too old now.
 
 
If you work with those hawt people form spooks,  
 
 
I assume you meant Intelligence officer, not Agent in your post. Agent's are basically contacts for the intelligence services, officers are the ones who do all the "James Bond" (or not...) stuff. And as for £20k a month, I do declare that you sir are making that up.  

phil.

I think they like people who speak Bengali as well. There's a list on the website I think

MI6 no longer exists, the name stopped being used years ago.

It is now the SIS (Secret Intelligence Service)

MI5 also ceased being an official name in 1929. The official name is the Security Service, and MI5 only ever appears as a sub-name.

MI5 is when you work for the intelligence INSIDE the UK (mainly to prevent any possible terrorist attacks or other threats to National Security)

MI6 - when they post you abroad to collect any intelligence for the British Intelligence Service
 
 
Maybe.

So it's called the SS now? Clever of them.
 
 
yes i think so

It means that they're responsible for espionage, subterfuge and counter-insurgency operations inside your house.

It was called the Security Service from 1931 onwards, so nothing sinister going on...

NOT mistaken! I had a friend, who told me he works for MI6 and gets 20k a month (he even showed me his bnk statments confirming his monthly income as we were kind of dating and hving casual sex); however, as soon as he told me that he works fo the Service.....he was killed in a car "accident" two says later   Isn't that weird?

Perhaps he meant 'you'd get paid [from a total budget of] £20k a month'.

Like any job, some of the work involved is boring and Greg wishes he got paid more, after taking a considerable wage cut to joinMI6. The entry pay scale depends on experience - Greg started on about £27,000.
 

 http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7112814.stm 

Fair enough, it says he started on £27k/year, but you are not going to go from that to £20k/month.

Maybe you get paid £20k/month. But you can't tell your family about it. Or your friends. Or acquaintances. Or, for that matter, strangers. And it doesn't go into your bank account, because that would cause suspicion. One simply visits one's approved purveyors of goods and/or services, giving them the secret handshake, then being supplied with equally 'imperceptible' goods/services.
 
 
yeah, sounds ace. my cousin works for MI6, or MI5..one of them. He lives in Paris now.

That'll be MI6 then.

But don't tell anyone...

Haha, I'm sure it's alright that I know (although, I don't think that it was alright for him to send back picture from North Korea, and then have my Uncle John show them to me at a family get together in Wigan...). He has the most amazing apartment, when I was going to take a gap year I was going to go and stay with him in Paris. Instead I came to rainy Manchester  
 
 
The pay is ****.

I should use that line next time I want to eject from casual sex. "I work for the secret service.. OH **** NOW I'VE TOLD YOU I'M GONNA DIE SORRY CYA LOL".

The end "lol" is for added sincerity.
 
 
I'd rather join the army tbh.

Sounds wonderful (aside from the leaking of official secrets, of course!   ).

I think, y'know, it rains in Paree sometimes too though.   (Mind, I'm sure that it's elegantly suave, exclusively sophisticated Parisian rain.   )

In fact, you don't get any money AT ALL. You only get the equivalent of 20k in goods and services. That way, MI6 can never be traced back to you, as they settle your debts through a middleman.

My friend hadto give them a list of the goods/services he needs every month in his last posting place (Miami....yes, yes! you heard it right! we even spy on the United States!). Anyway, his list was as follows:

-a new Ferrari (the full cost had been arranged by the MI6 to be paid in 10-month installments)
-30 visits to male-escorts in Miami (yes, dude! you got it right! my friend was visiting a new gorgeous, athletic escort EVERY single night....well, he had an unusually HIGH sex drive and MI6 was perfectly aware of this)
-groceries list for an entire month
-2 pairs of Prada shoes
-3 pairs of "D&G" jeans
-30 new pairs of "Calvin Klein" underwear
-A new "Sony" plasma TV
-3 new laptops
-60 entries to different clubs in Miami on 30 separate nights....ermm....and I think that was the end of his list.

Not to mention the 90 mobile phones complete with 90 new SIM cars he was getting for free (as part of his job) from MI6 to keep in touch with London + 30 Iridium satellite phones.

Impressive, huh!? It really pays working for MI6 !!!  

And don' make me laught (I'm adressing those who doubt th 20k every month "pay")! What is 20k to a Secret Intelligence Service!!?? Hell.....they are so powerful, they can set up theiw own "printing house" and print their own money in billions if they want to, without asking for Gordon Brown's approval!!!

Don't use this line unless MI6 really hires you! By the way, are you beautiful, lol????????????????????????????? ??????????????
Read my last post what perks you get*
 
 
I wouldn't, I enjoy the simple things in life too much.

This is a GENUINE story. Believe me!!!! That's what you get from MI6. No cash. Services and good only.

That's wonderful. I suppose they need people from all sections of society, especially because recruiting very narrowly would presumably allow 'enemies of the state' to infer who was working for whom more easily.

also because you don't need a university degree to be well qualified for the job.

Unfortunately for Duggie, MI6 don't make a habit of employing people whose transparency (or density) exceeds that of plate-glass. 'Bunk statements', indeed.

Of course! I was kind of having casual sex with him whenever he used to be back in London!
Oh! And I didn't tell you that IN BETWEEN his missions, he could book his tickets FIRST class with "British Airways" for a ridiculously low price.
Like, to fly from London to New Yrok First Class, you'd usually pay £6k, but he'd only pay £500 (or, rather, he'd instruct MI6 to pay for him out of his 20k allowance!). Isn't that beatiful!!?? Now I ALSO want to become an MI6 agent even though I'd have to die 3 months later as I can't keep my mouth shut. But I wonder what kin of death they'd arrange for me? Another car "accident", or a fall from a mountain while mounteneering in Nepal? Or maybe I'd "choke" on ice-cream!!!!???

Well, guys, if you ever read of a guy who chocked on ice-cream on the frontpage of "The Times", I beg you to persuade your MP to launch a Hutton-Hutton enquiry into the circumstances surrounding my death!

i would love to! but i obviously wouldnt get in!

love to work for the SAS as well. HA! but Hell would freeze over first then the LHC causing a major black hole then me getting into the sas
 
 
i would so do it! but im such a scatter brain that i think i'd let slip something really confidential by accident :P
 
 
Yes is the simple answer, not that the skills I do have would necessarily be the 'right' ones or of any use in a profession with the SIS. However, I do have a good enough concept of the fact that those employed in this field don't actually spend their lives pratting about with Ferraris and Prada sunglasses, in the same way that forensic science graduates never materialise at the Scene Of The Crime and just analyse a few decomposing toenails in a lab if it happens to be a particularly riveting day.
 
 
id love this job, only have 2 more years to wait till i reach the 21!
 
 
It amuses me because whatever languages they're particularly looking for at the time basically says which nation they're operating most in ><

I looked a few months ago and it was mandarin >< hehehe
 
 
Cool.
 
 
I think I would find the whole undercover thing too much pressure to be in MI6. So much responsibilty is on you not slipping up with the fine details in your story...

Maybe I have just been watching too much TV lol
 
 
i think the hardest part would remembering every bit of ur background story correctly. not sure how good i would be at that?

I know but it's not exactly a huge secret which countries pose the most 'threat' to us at the moment. Everyone knows there are loads of people over here spying for the china.
 
 
I'd love to, after watching Spooks it seems like a fun but dangerous job, knowing me though I'd probably be caught out and killed or something in my first mission.
 
 
One would suspect that people quite often have a very dramatic and unreflective outlook on what working for them is actually like. Personally, I have little doubt it could be - potentially - very challenging work from an intellectual perspective, but likewise I don't ignore the perhaps more rational attitude that it contains as many administrative, political, and satisfaction concerns largely typical elsewhere. I don't know about you, but I get the feeling it's the kind of job where we'd often go in with too many of our own layered, sociological conceptions and not enough hard realism.

I would suspect that to be a major plus point in any candidate looking to apply, besides acceptance that James Bond is very largely a figure of literature - you are not. Then there is the fact that the OSA doesn't exactly allow you to make multi million dollar movies about your work, which is not going to revolve around stopping deranged feline loving Belgians (therefore meaning any producer would laugh at you - films about endless surveillance duties, paperwork, run-ins with the various offices of state looking to shift you every which way but loose etc., are not going to sell as much without a little spice, at least). It's quite possible, however, that I have my own misconceptions - the ultimate point is I don't know, and why would anyone want a job based on conception alone?

I'd question them more than they would question me, but, at bottom, would do it if what I regarded to be enough information throughout the process told me, "yep, would be a decent job." No more, no less, to be dull about it. Common sense really, which is arguably more valuable in seeking to work for the services than most others, perhaps.
 
 
i would love to do the mission, life too short to be worried about health and safety. and it'll be fun!!
 
 
I would bloody love it!  

I've always wanted to me a female agent exploring the world and hunting people down.   Perfect excuse to blow off some steam and kill some people.
 
 
why not it won't be like james bond, your better of joining the army really, then trying for the SAS
 
 
yes i would absoltuely love to!
i know it seems stupid because my aspiration comes from a tv programme which clearly doesn't portray things wholly accurately but everytime i watch Spooks and James Bond etc i just wish it was me!
the jobs just seem really interesting and you'd feel as if you were doing something worthwhile and exciting!
 
 
it looks really interesting and intellectually challenging, includes a lot of traveling and you'd be on fore front of international politics, but I think it would be quite difficult, especially if you had a family.
 
 
First: ROFL at all the people who think the people in spooks are meant to work for MI6  
Secondly: MI5 are now called the Security Service, but shortening it call it BSS (British Security Service) for obvious reasons  .

Thirdly: Maybe, but I'd rather join  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special...sance_Regiment , sounds much more fun + you actually get to do stuff rather than just gather intelligence  . Supposedly those guys arrested in Iraq a while ago dressed as arabs were part of it.

first of all the warning was because i mispelled the f word (******) so it wasnt censored. secondly if you look at the picture closely you will realise that its not hitler at all, its actually george bush with black hair and a mustache, i chose it because the resemblance was unbelievable and ironic as they are both dictators.
 
 
I'm not sure.
Maybe if I knew what the infomation I was getting would be used for, instead of just being told to grab something like a robot.
Because let's be honest, our government is in the wrong sometimes.

I've no doubt it would be really interesting though.
 
 
Either you're a liar, or your 'boyfriend' is a liar.
 
 
I'd love to be able to use my degree (Arabic and also next year Persian) directly, but I don't know if I am patriotic enough to use it for countering cultures and regions that I am interested in. Also, the pay isn't that great, and if I am right, funding for the SIS is set to decrease.
 
 
I just applied.  
Oh you have to be over 21. Well that sucks.
 
 
Would i? DEFINITELY! That would be my dream job, working as a secret agent, think about the risk involved, WOW! I'm not academically gifted (although I try very hard) but I would love to have the type of job where i can work as a field agent or something similar. I'm very good with secrets. Did I mention that would be my dream job?
(P.S. IF SOMEONE FROM Mi6 OR SOMETHING SIMILAR, READS THIS, TRUST ME I'M YOUR MAN. RECRUIT ME!)
 
 
Epic bumpage.
 
 
I'm nowhere near intelligent enough to join MI61 (plus i'd fail the medical as i'm really not mentally stable).

I always wanted to be a CSI when i was younger.  
 
 
lmfao.
That application is for people wanting to listen to phone calls trying to find some intel.
The real 'spies' get recruited by a tap on the shoulder in an oxbridge common room or out of the army/police force.
 
 
I have to be honest some of the posts on here make me chuckle.

Anyone who thiks MI6 is like Spooks is someone they would never employ because if you can't follow the very simple plot point that SPooks is about MI5 NOT MI6 then you wouldn't be the most observant of people now would you?
 
 
lol thats not how they recruit spies. As has already been said you'll be approached in a uni common room, or in the Foreign Office and someone will ask you to keep an eye out, or from the police/army.

With secret service style things the general consensus is that if someone wants to be a spy they are not the right person for the job.
 
 
Id love too.
 
 
Seems interesting but aren't they racist?

Imagine the MI6 contacts you and says 'we think you'd be a perfect agent' and they'd want to post you to all sorts of countries and you'd get paid £20 k a month and your first mission would be to go to some Middle Eastern country to collect some vital intelligence while posing as an innocent uni student from Britain.
Would you take up this opportunity?

P.S. Remember what their website says about the criteria:

- You must be a British Citizen
- You will have to pass a medical and drugs test (haven't used Class A drugs (for example, Ecstasy, Cocaine etc) in the last 12 months and haven't used Class B/C drugs (for example, Amphetamines, Cannabis etc) in the last 6 months).
- You will need to be Security Cleared (PLEASE BE AWARE THAT IN ORDER TO OBTAIN DEVELOPED VETTING SECURITY CLEARANCE, YOU MUST BE OVER THE AGE OF 21 AT THE TIME OF ENTRY.)
- You will have to keep your identity secret from your family and friends and you understand that you will be made to "disappear" if you ever divulge to anyone that you're an agent for MI6 (lol!   the last 'criteria' is just a joke - take it easy! pheww!)

 

I would definitely consider it. I'm full of energy and enthusiasm. I get on with a wide range of different people and would be confident in blending into another culture.
It would be a very exciting opportunity.
 
 
No, I probably wouldn't be good at that sort of thing.
 
 
This thread does make me giggle. I think recruitment is highly centered on personality, it takes at lest 6 months to get through the interviewing stage. Typically they want quiet, introverted types with emotional stability, organization and common scene as well as a 2:1 at university with a fluency in another language and previous work experience; i doubt they'd employ anyone under 21, purely as someone that young i would doubt have enough experience.
Plus your job moves while your there, i think everyone moves around in the work there but entry jobs are either as an intelligence analyst or officer. Very hard to know what exactly they want or what their work pays as after all they are a secret service.
I personally would not want to work as a spy for example, as this i would imagine is incredibly dangerous work! Everything to do with this kind of work is incredibly over glamorized in movies and tv shows, i don't watch tv shows based on anything to do with this type of work or even forensics or detectives as i wouldn't want to have a distorted view on something so 'serious'.
As for oxbridge students only, i really don't believe in that. Personality and experience far out ways which university you went to.
 
 
Im studying Engineering and am going to do a few years in the royal engineers and get some field experience before i apply for MI6. Its been on my mind for some time whether i should do it or not.

Yes, if I had the relevant training.

But, I'm not that inconspicuous, and would probably be ****...
 
 
If I told you that I'd have to kill you

No I wouldn't want to. It sounds exciting, and the pay is amazing, but way too dangerous for me.

I'll just be content sitting at home and watching Chuck on telly  

 

same. You would have to deceive a whole lot of people, lie etc. I can't do that. I want a common job and lead an ignorant life.

Not really. Not only would I be defending something I don't really believe in, but I also suspect that it's nowhere near as glamorous and interesting as popular culture would have use believe.

 

I completely agree with this. Yet there is something alluring about working with them..
 
 
 
ftfy  

 

cheers
 
 
Wow, ths thread is full of stupidity.
 
 
tbf if i was going to work for the secret service i wouldnt be putting it on the internet
 
 
If I were a British citizen and has resided there would be, I'd have gone to work in MI-6. In general, a childhood dream to become some kind of secret agent. And has always been an ardent fan of James Bond.
And I would go there, despite the risks, dangers, and the wages I was not particularly interested in the least. The main thing that is very interesting, and it's a decent job.
But I am not a British citizen. I live in Ukraine. And we have to get a job in the intelligence service should have to pay a bribe. And the work of a very different - we have intelligence agencies generally do nothing - are used for repression of political opponents of the regime. Moreover, using silly.

Therefore, you are very lucky, but you still do not like something.

P.S. Sorry for bad English.
 
 
MI6 is a JOKE!

CIA > MI6
ASIS > MI6

M16 sucks, they continuously get killed by russian spys. (And the real reason of failure is never shown!) Not surprised MI6 sucked up to Gadaffi either. They were following Tony Blair and his public embrace of the tyrant. They even made cupcakes and disguised them as bombs - what a JOKE!  

EDIT: Funny how people compare working as a secret agent to being a BOND - NOTHING LIKE it! Haha, you people who say this are nothing but fools.

What an unmitigated twonk.
Aside from that last line. That bit's true.

What? youve never read about many complete failures of the CIA?
 
 
It's the same as the armed police or being a politician, from a moral sense. If you want to be one/work for them, you are wholly unsuitable to do so.
 
 
 
you would have to blend in. A white man in the middle of the middle east is not the best of undercover work. Someone with good linguistic and intellegence is a plus

and 2 answer the question, then yes i am going to apply after career in the police/army

 

How do you plan on doing that when you've just divulged your plan and IP to all the interwebs?
 
 
20k seems quite crap considering the kind of work you would be doing. Otherwise, pay aside....'... I wouldn't mind working forMI5/MI6 or GCHQ.
 
 
The green chipolatas are on the bus. i repeat:

The green chipolatas are on the bus

I call you the twonk for not even explaining why I am one. Keep believing in the rubbish the government sends your way.

Of course I have. But as funny as it may be, it never can quite compare to the failures and foolishness of MI6.

I'll believe it because I've been inside the circle and know the truth.

You'll not believe it because you're an uneducated goon who watches too much American tv and doesn't have the intellect to do anything for real.

Ever thought there might be a reason why the papers carry stories suggesting that the SIS might not be ruthlessly efficient? Never considered that having people underestimate you is a good thing? Or that not publishing successes because it exposes methods is a pretty sensible way of a secret service working? No, of course not. You know better...  
 
 
 
Yeah and i think I would be good at the job since I can speak two languages, am asian so could fit in well with a 'black area' and wouldnt look too out of place in a 'white area'. I think i have some good qualities like i can lie quite well etc.
I really wanted to be part of mi6 after watching Spooks.

 

Have you heard John le Carre's views on Spooks? Something like, "They run around shooting and killing each other, it's crazy"

MI6 is far more open than the CIA. Im sure we dont even hear about most of the failures in both organisations. I also find it very hard believing you can give a sound judgement on the issue unless you actually worked for MI6 or the CIA, if you did you wouldnt be on TSR

Wait a second while I ignore that bull****.

I am a goon doing an Electronic Engineering degree, and my father works in law enforcement. I don't watch ANY tv at all either. I don't even have a license.

Your argument here is worthless. For a start, NO paper EVER publishes detailed working methods of the secret service that will undermine national security. If that did happen, the company would go down in flames in an hours notice, and there would be a federal investigation on everybody behind the business.

People underestimating you is not necessarily a "GOOD Thing." Oh yes, lets just persuade those jihaddist terrorists living among our country to plan an attack. Lets keep making the secret service look useless and unprepared. NO. That is not how things work - both AUSTRALIA and the USA have an serious stance against terrorism and both countries try and advertise national security measures being taken in order to actively dis-encourage terrorism.
 
 
I can't think it would be that interesting. Britain is no longer an important country, and countries no longer really have wars anyway. You're essentially a secret policeman, spending exorbitant sums of money to possibly prevent a handful of terrorism deaths. You'd be better off driving an ambulance if you want to make a difference, and contrary to the hilarious salary estimate in the OP, it pays about the same.
 
 
 
Britain is no longer an important country,

 

You're such a moron.

Britain is one of the most important countries on the planet.
 
 
It's not really "secret" is it now?

Not rly. It's a me-too for the generally most powerful side, but not a lot more.

Don't get me wrong - I like Britain, and I'm sad that it has come to this, but it's just the demographic reality. You can't sustain being a world power with 1% of the world population, especially when most of the rest of the world is no longer so terribly backward.

Because we're not a superpower we're not an important country?

We are a major power in the world by ourselves. The EU is a potential superpower, has the highest GDP in the world and we are a leading part of that.

Britain is VERY important in the world. Stop being an imbecile.

Britain could very well become a province of a great power - in which case it wouldn't be a country at all, any more than Texas or California are countries.
