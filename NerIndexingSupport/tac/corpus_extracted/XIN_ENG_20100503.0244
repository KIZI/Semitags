Cuban leader Raul Castro met here with President of the Spanish Communist Party
(PCE) Jose Luis Centella, vowing to boost ties between the parties of the two
countries, the official daily Granma said on Monday.

The two exchanged views on current international situations, the cooperation
between the two parties and their impression about the massive demonstration on
May Day, when the Cuban people showed their support for the president's economic
reform.

The visit of the PCE delegation to Cuba coincided with a media campaign against
the nation promoted by the United States and echoed by its allies in the
European Union.

The Spanish Communist Party has always shown support for the Cuban revolution
during the U.S. media campaign, Granma said.
