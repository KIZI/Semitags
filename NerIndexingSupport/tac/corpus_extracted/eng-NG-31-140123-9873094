ASU wins again

Erickson has the Sun Devils on the march.  He's the coach the Devils
have been looking for since the days of Frank Kush.  ASU has two games
at home (Washington and Cal), two games on the road (Oregon and UCLA),
then two more games at home (USC and Arizona).

I'd guess that some in this group are too young to remember when the
Pac-10 was the Pac-8.  Arizona and ASU (my alma mater) were in the WAC.
But ASU upset Nebraska in the Fiesta Bowl and was invited, along with
Arizona, to join the Pac 8 (that's my recollection of it, anyway,
please correct me if I'm wrong).  That made it the Pac 10, and I reckon
they need two more teams and they can call it...*

There was talk in the media about adding Colorado and Texas.  No,
really, there was.  Does anyone remember?  In order to do that, they'd
have to use another meaning for "Pacific," like the NFL did when they
invented a new meaning for West.

Big game tomorrow.  Go Hawks!

*...two six pacs.

I had no doubts at all that he would turn ASU into a college
juggernaut when he was hired on.

I also have absolutely no doubts whatsoever that he'll parlay his
eventual success at ASU into a 3rd stint in the NFL. With the coaching
retreads that were hired in the last offseason, it's now hard for me
to still believe that Erickson has blown his final NFL opportunity.

Yeah, especially if he wins a national championship. Pete Carroll is
being wooed for his third stint in the NFL. Of course, Carroll twice
posted a winning record as HC of the Pats.

While I'm not keen on seeing Erickson as the Seahawks coach again, I
do think he's better than a handful of current NFL coaches, including
Norv Turner and Scott Linehan.
