Back at St James' Park this Saturday, ECFC face yet another (well, I suppose
all games are!) tough game. This

time against Cambridge United.

Cambridge have started well this season, and are currently third in the
table whilst ECFC occupy sixth place.

You can send your Cambridge prediction to: ph ... @pinhoe.plus.com,

which should arrive at the latest one hour before kick-off (ie by 2pm on
Saturday).

If, for some reason you forget and are not near an internet connection when
you remember, you can

text your prediction to 07899 932616.  I will, however, not take texts less
than 90 minutes prior

to kick-off so as not to give anybody in the ground an unfair advantage.

*** Please DO NOT send your predictions to the list ***

My own prediction for this game is:

ECFC 0  Cambridge United 1

Cheers,

Phil
