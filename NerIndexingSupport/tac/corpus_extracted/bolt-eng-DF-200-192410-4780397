 
 
Which celebrity body would you most like to have?
 
 
Who's figure would you want to have the most? I like figures that are slim, toned and curvy, like Jlo and Kelly Brook. What do you think?
 
 
Justin Timberlake.  
 
 
oh, Kelly Brook please!! I'm attempting to get my body into her shape for the beach...(not going to happen but i can dream)....i'm halfway there, just need longer legs now!! need longer legs!!! otherwise, love Beyonce and Salma Hayek...if I was a man....mmm  
 
 
Eva Longoria.

nuff said
 
 
Colleen McLoughlin (Don't know if that's how it's spelt..)
 
 
Adriana Lima definately.
But if i was smaller Eva Longoria.
 
 
I already have it.  

 
 
 
Eva Longoria. Curvy but petite, that's how I'd like to be. Now all I must do is steal it from her and everything will be fine.  
 
 
why do I need it? I'm already perfect      
 
 
Rik Waller  
 
 
 

Brad pitt in fight club..hell yeah.
 
 
Charlotte Church

 
 
 
Kelly Brooke or Eva Longoria!
 
 
Jessica Alba. Or Kelly Brook.
 
 
Gwenyth Paltrow. But I'd never wear her shoes.

I have that poster on my wall.   My boyfriend is shaped like that, except he has broader shoulders. Mmm...

Personally, there are a fair few things I'd change about myself - but all the same I can't actually think of a "celebrity" body I'd like.. I can't think of anyone with my frame who actually looks natural.  
 
 
Sarah Harding springs to mind.

I have the shape, just not enough time in the gym to get his tonation. By summer though  . Hence him being a realistic goal! Unfortunatly i doubt i'll be as rich as him  
 
 
She's been mentioned a few times but Kelly Brooke  
 
 
 

Denise Van Outen always gives me bikini body envy.
I wouldn't want Eva Longoria's as I think she's too thin. And too short.
 
 
Kiera knightley or christina millian

Ahh that's what I meant - he's well-toned as well as having the shape.   Good luck with toning up anyway (and on the money front, too, for that matter!)  
 
 
nicole richieee
 
 
This one please

 
 
 
Kelly Brook, as above. I think I could look like that if I was a little more toned  
 
 
My body with my penis replaced with Albert Einstein's penis. Its the smartest thing to ever come out of a womans mouth.
 
 
noone has mentioned this person, but i would love to have a body like Beyonce's
 
 
Definitely Beyonce's....anyday!
 
 
Jennifer Morrison

 
 
 
BRITNEY (in her Do Somethin vid)   & Beyonce.
 
 
Eva Longoria, even though she's been mentioned loads. She seems to be thinner now though - I preferred her a couple of months ago when she was curvier.

Vanessa Hudgens

Cute and petite with gorgeous legs and hips XD
 
 
Daniel Craig
 
 
Kelly Brooke or Myleene Klass  
 
 
Jessica Simpson... wouldn't mind her face either, she's absolutely stunning! Cheryl Cole too, she has a wicked figure. Coleen would be my more realistic goal (a distant one at that!) as she's got a very girl next door image but is toned and curvy in the right places and suits not being stick-thin.

 
 
 
Barry from Eastenders
 
 
Charlotte church or martine mccutcheon. Or tyra banks.   x x
 
 
Mike Tyson, so i can rape the next person that uses the word celebrity.
 
 
Brad Pitt please and thank you  
 
 
Jessica Alba!
Also, Cheryl Cole or Nicola Roberts
 
 
Arnold Swarchenegger.  

Nah, don't know really, maybe Patrick Dempsey.
 
 
Cutie Xx, I may be in Zante the same time as you  .

And I'd have Cheryl Cole's, just before she lost quite so much weight. And I'd like her face as well.

No...Jessica Alba's face. But not so much her body; I don't think she's got any hips.
 
 
I change my mind. I'll have Angelina Jolie's body in Tombraider.
 
 
i don't know.
the not-so-emaciated mary kate olsen or anna friel?
 
 
Adriana Lima  

Spoiler:

 

 

 

GOD she is gorgeous  

or Hayden Panettiere
Spoiler:

 

 

 

Britney Spears at her peak

Spoiler:
 
 
 
 

No seriously, i'm quite happy as i am thanks.
 
 
Josh Lewsey. Beast.

 
 
 
Martine McCutcheon.
 
 
 
EDIT: SCRAP THAT, ^ agree with above, Martine's got a hot body. But I do love Beyonce's arse. Phwoar.
&&&
Megan Fox's FACE!

I have to make do with myself though, so I don't think about this too often.
 
 
Hayden's body is wierd, she looks just strange I really cannot put my finger on what it is...

In those pictures above it looks like she doesn't have much of a waist...shes a bit straight up and down I think. Still wish I was that toned though!

Dawn French

I'd love those "babelicious baps"

She's only just 18 and quite a lot of 18 year olds haven't quite developed fully into their bodies. I looked like that until I put on a bit of weight and suddenly you could see a waist and proper curves. Or she could just be straight up and down and I'm thnking about it too much.
 
 
Adriana's...or Kelly's
 
 
I like Coleen Mcloughlins figure

To be fair, I think your face and body are perfect as they are.
 
 
leighton meester gorgeous XD
 
 
I agree with all of them except Charlotte Chuch and Coleen. Sharika has an amazing figure I think, so does Eva Mendes.
 
 
Myleene Class

Haha, thankyou, but I can assure you that I am not perfect.  .
 
 
kate moss pls.
 
 
Shakiraaaaa!!! or kelly brooke
 
 
Nicole Scherzinger
 
 
Mossy
N Richie pre preg
The ginger from Girls Aloud

nicole ritchie PRE preg? shes hardly put too much on now has she?  
 
 
Not really a celeb but Keeley Hazell seems to have an amazing figure!! I say seems to because i couldn't find any unphotoshopped pics!!

Spoiler:
   

failing that, i wouldn't complain too much if i had Scarlett Johanssons body!
Spoiler:
   
 
 
Mischa barton
 
 
JT PLLLLLLEEAASSEE ( hoping if I ask REALLY nicely it'll happen)
 
 
Yeah Justin does have one of the best male bodies.
 
 
Mylene Klass
...but considering I'm horrifically pale we'd pretty much have to work from scratch to get there  
 
 
I swear i'm like the only person who finds JT fugleh ~

Zac Braff *_*
 
 
I'd like to be a slightly musclier version of Brad Pitt, I think he is a bit bigger now, but in that posted photo of fight club he's a little skinny, he only has a 6 pack because he has no meat.

There was a guy on 'America's Most Smartest Model' (   ) that I wanted to look like.

It seems that girls generally want to be a little bigger than I initially expected.

Was it VJ? I wanted to be him too

Well I wouldn't mind, but no I actually meant Brett. There was a guy with longish curly hair with some facial hair and I liked that look, btw his really camp voice and huge mouth was annoying, hah!

I can't actually remember their bodies though, so I don't know which body out of VJ and Brett I wanted.

Do you think we're the only sad people on TSR that actually watched this crappy but surprisingly fun to watch/addictive show?

Oh hell no, that stuff was absolute gold. I lost track of when it was on tv though - was good while it lasted.

And this was VJ, having googled him I found out that he actually won the show   Good for him:

 

If I could look like anyone in the world right now it would be him.

Same here. She's thin, but not toned at all. No waist. Her tummy just looks like a 5 year old boy's.
 
 
As much as I hate Paris Hilton, I like her bikini body!

 
 
 
None, as I wouldn't be me   I may not be perfect, but I am who I am.
 
 
No contest - Beyonce  
 
 
If I found a guy that looked like this:

 

perfect amount of muscle and hair. ah, beautiful!
 
 
Scott Steiner. Okay i dont know if he counts as a celebrity? Hes a wrestler and hes like crazily muscley.
 
 
Adriana Lima!!!
Alessandra Ambrosio
Gisele Bundchen
Tyra Banks in her heyday (so basically any current/former Victoria's Secret angel lol)
Paris Hilton
Kimberly Walsh
Britney in her heyday
 
 
I'd want someone elegant looking like Milla Jovovich

 
 
 
^ she looks amazing

jamie dornan, hands down
 
 
Katie Price....minus the boobs, mines are big enough! lol
 
 
I wish I could look like rihanna or beyonce. Which ever is good. But if I could have a superpower it would be to transform into any body type that I desired. Oh well I just have to jump into toxic waste for that to happen.
 
 
I don't see the appeal of Eva Longoria's body... no hips!!!
