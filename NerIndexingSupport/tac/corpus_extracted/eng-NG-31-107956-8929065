OT: Ode to the Red Sox

There are choking noises coming from the northeast again...

Hello squander, my old friend,
I’ve come to talk with you again,
A little dribbler softly creeping,
Another groundout leaves me weeping,
And the horror that is planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the walls of Fenway.

In restless dreams I walk alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
‘Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of
the ballpark lights
That split the night
And touched the walls of Fenway.

And in the naked light I saw
Thirty thousand people, maybe more.
People watching without cheering,
People jeering without listening,
People chanting taunts that fans should never share
And no one cared
Within the walls of Fenway.

Fools said I, you do not know
Ineptness like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.
But my words like silent popups fell,
And echoed
In the halls of Fenway

And the people bowed and prayed
To the baseball God they made.
And the scoreboard flashed its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the signs said the calls of the umpires
Are written on the Monster’s walls
The division falls.
And whispered in the sounds of silence.

(with apologies to Paul Simon)

GO YANKEES !

Both the Red Sox and Yankees will need a prayer or two because the Tribe is
going to scalp them.

We shall see.   We have to go through the Yankees and then most likely the
Red Suxs before we take the ALS.   Should be a great ALCS.  National League
teams do not stand a chance this year.

Toronto had put a whuppin' on Boston yesterday?

With an almost unlimited budget the Yankees try to *buy* a championship
every year.  As a result they are a good team year after year.  On the other
hand, the BoSux, Tribe and Angels have also run the marathon race ahead of
the Yankees and may be better teams, despite their lower payrolls (although
the BoSux had a large enough budget to buy Manny and Coco away from the
Tribe).

As I said in previous posts.........this years World Series winner will be
from the American League.  All 4 AL teams that will be in the ALCS are
worthy contenders.

But then again..........we have to remember what happened last year.

We'll see.  You've got to admit that they've got a certain amount of
late season momentum going, and the pitching looks like it might
finally come together.

But it's too little too late.

For the short term, I would agree.  And teams do get hot this time of
year - 2004 Red Sox are probably the greatest example of that.

But their bullpen is still suspect and much like the Sox, their bats
can go cold in a New York minute.

If they take the division over the Sox, it's not like the end of the
world - two more games and they are locked into the playoffs.

That's a whole different season.
 
 
  Wayne.B <waynebatrecdotbo...@hothail.com>

But up until recently they weren't getting their money's worth.

:-)

And of course no one forced the other teams to sell.
