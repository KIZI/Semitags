Well I'm from El Salvador and most people when you mention Britain they think about the distinguished accent(cockney mostly) and try to do it. Oh also the teams of the Premiere league specially Liverpool, Manchester, Chelsea and Arsenal.
 
 
Imperialism.

The irony of you talking like that and her original post saying being polite/proper...

You don't get to choose what other people know you by, that's the way it works, numbnuts.
 
 
 
 
 
 
I mean what they are well-known for in the whole world?  

 

Bad Teeth.
 
 
Most people assume I'm posh, drink tea, have bad teeth, eat terrible food and know the queen.

Probably other I can't think about.
 
 
 
From France: Disgusting food.

 

You serious? the fry up is amazing... better Bacon than France too    

Well the fry up, queen, football, hooligans, british politeness, british snobbery, Hugh Grant, David Beckham, the empire and the NHS... although it isn't what it used to be... hello Cuba

Because the media in this country has changed the way we think about ourselves the same way bullies change the opinion of victims in schools so they consider themselves worthless etc.
 
 
slave trade,opium wars,colonialism (invasion of weak countries),tea,"poshness",compla ining,bad teeth etc.
 
 
FOOTBALL.

In the words of my Taiwanese friends: "Before we met you we thought that all British people are arrogant. Why else would you have put the word 'Great' in front of Britain?" Fair point.

Stop generalising, I'm from France and love it... even top chefs say that some british food is better than the French counter-parts    
 
 
 
Good-looking guys. :P :P :P

 

I found a website in my language that suggests England has the most good looking guys!   I am not posting it here because you guys won't understand it. Don't know how they measure that, probably just asking hundreds of women XD

But before coming to UK, I heard that England is very posh country! I didnt know about Scotland/Wales/Northern Ireland though.
 
 
I KNOW THAT THEY ARE Stereotypes :

Yellow teeth
Tea (with milk)
English breakfast : bacon, eggs and baked beans
Bad weather, "It rains everyday"
Don't speak foreign languages
Girls are easy and "dress inappropriately" (no offence)
Drink till they get drunk
Rude
Snobbish
Bad food
Cold people
Fat girls
Reserved people
 
 
Harry Potter.
 
 
moaning! the brits are great at it :P
 
 
Queuing.
 
 
Complaining, tea and the British accent.
Which is ridiculous, because most Brits don't have the stereotypical well-spoken accent, but there you go  
 
 
Fish and Chips and Bangers and Mash

Couple of things that I've learned living in the US that we're known for:

1) Bad teeth
2) BBC
3) Drinking tea
4) The Queen
5) Still banging on about the empire
6) Calling the colonials the colonials
7) Being stuck up
8) Boarding school

Unfortunately, I seem to compound all of these beliefs except bad teeth.
 
 
Here, almost all football fans you see would be saying "we shall win this weekend" and I would be like when the hell did league matches start in India but they would be talking about the ManUs, Chelseas and Arsenals etc  

For me, it would be (not in any order):
-Sherlock Holmes
-The Beatles
-Somerset Maugham & Shakespeare
-Football ofc, David Beckham being the major reason  
-Inventing Cricket, which is like a religion here now  
-In the film fraternity, as the homes of Jason Statham. Christian Bale..  
-And ofc, the atrocities committed during the 200 years of ruling...still alive in the History books and being passed onto generation after generation, but nobody seems to care so much these days
-Finally, the Oxford and the Cambridge..
 
 
many good things.

gorgeous accents. high tea. etiquette. stiff upper lip. black cabs.

and....the exorbitant pound. unfriendly londoners. rain. and i could never understand why people shun eye contact and stare into space on the tube?!  
 
 
 
Do you always quote Hugh Grant?

Actually, Hugh Grant! He's quite famous innit!

 

I think this is the first time!

 
The bit he's quoting was actually said by Hugh Grant...

 

I'm a girl  
 
 
 
But before coming to UK, I heard that England is very posh country! I didnt know about Scotland though.

 

Something to do with the fact that outside the UK Scotland is not recognised as a seperate country (nor is England)... Wales doesn't exist  

THough it would help if the countries marketed outside of the UK for holidays

The English language and being hugely ignorant of other cultures, an example of this being a joke I was told by an Argentinian I know:
"What do you call someone who speaks 3 languages?"
"I don't know"
"Trilingual! What do you call someone who speaks 2 languages?"
"I don't know"
"Bilingual! What do you call someone who only speaks one language?"
"..."
"ENGLISH!"

Is that supposed to be a joke ?

I bet your argie friend is a right laugh out on the piss  
 
 
Literature,
Technology,
Science,
Engineering,
Philosophy,
Art,
Television Media,
Britains rich historical past.

Britain has contributed immensly to the world
 
 
Facebook is making it blindingly clear that we are famous for being hated by everyone else.

I would be bothered, but I'm too busy smoking a pipe, stroking my moustache, and watching cricket whilst checking my pocket-watch with my monocle to see if it's time for tea yet.

There is a reason for that though
You can really get around just about everywhere with english because it is such a widely spoken language. English is all you really need in today's world.
Someone from Sweden, on the other hand, is going to find it far more valuable to learn english because swedish won't get him that far. So most swedes are probably going to know more than one language.
 
 
Fish and Chips

Burburry

Harrods

A love of Indian food

Beans on Toast

Baked Potatoes.
 
 
 
-World War 1
-World War 2

 

No that's Germany, please don't get the two countries mixed up.

Edit: What am I saying, of course Britain is famous for WW2, they are famous for saving Europe  
 
 
tutting...
 
 
slavery
 
 
 

 

 

 
 
 
Relentless colonisation and and extreme racism covered by a thin layer of tolerance.

and many of the world useful discoveries.

and the Queen

and the Beatles

and our diverse range of accents in such a small area

and our food

...I could go on...
 
 
Colonialism and slavery.
 
 
 
Colonialism and slavery.

 

Thats rich coming from a Chinese person.
 
 
^ We didn't enslave, whip, rape or lynch black people. We didn't invade so many countries.
 
 
 
^ We didn't enslave, whip, rape or lynch black people. We didn't invade so many countries.

 

The chinese enslaved tens of thousands of Koreans. And China invaded and colonised many countries. Just because you did not colonise as many as britain is not an excuse.
 
 
 
Colonialism and slavery.

 

Slavery....come off it. It was the Americans that loved slavery. The British Empire was the single greatest thing to happen on this planet. Maybe if the empire was still around, the rest of the world wouldn't be so ****.
 
 
The last great Empire.
 
 
When I think of British; the first few things that pop into my mind are tea, scones, stephen fry, cambridge, the queen, fun accents, skirt suits.

Oh, and binge drinking/pubs.
 
 
Tea and the queen apparently
 
 
creating soccer?
 
 
Driving on the "other" side of the road.  
 
 
Teen pregnancy and binge-drinking. Actually no. Not everywhere really knows about that, Russians seem to think that every Englishman will drink tea at 5 o'clock every day (they also know you like it with milk) and that they all dress like the Queen. It's entertaining  
 
 
Probably the Monarchy
 
 
Manchester United     and/or any other football clubs   For football  
 
 
in portugal we have a whole lot of british tourists (especially in algarve) so we joke with your pale skin and the way you turn lobster red after being in the sun x) And when you try to speak portuguese but can't help the accent! Of course these are all stereotypes we like to joke with but generally we have a good idea of the uk, mainly regarding the language (there's a lot of people speaking fluent english) and the culture (arts, music, celebrities etc). I'm a huge fan of a lot of bands from the uk and I can say for sure I'm not the only one. Oh, and cheryl cole. She's famous, maybe not as much as the american stars, but she is  
 
 
 
I mean what they are well-known for in the whole world?  

 

judging by my erasmus experience - Tea, drinking and fighting
 
 
yep we invented the pint
 
 
British contributions to the world -

Industralisation,
Technology and Science (huge number of nobel prize winners)
Philosophy,
literature,
The English Language,
worlds most popular sports,
 
 
The jokes about rotten teeth have been done to death but I always wondered if Lucas jokes were popular outside of north america? We had a lot of unreliable British cars shipped to the US during the 1970s and they became famous for their shoddy lucas electronics. Here is a humorous list of Lucas, Prince of darkness jokes:

 http://www.kitcar.com/articles-kitca...as-prince.html 
 
 
terrible teeth,their love for tea and the ability to form an orderly queue
 
 
 
 

 

  food porn
 
 
As a foreigner I guess I have a less partial perspective on this. Where I live Brits are known for the accent, tea (so far I haven't tasted anything extraordinay), driving on the wrong side of the road, a really strange sense of humour, some bands, some authors, Shakespeare, fat people, London, Oxbridge, the slave trade and a long history of invading other countries. (No judgement, I'm a descendant of vikings myself) I suspect the monarchy is famous too, just not in Sweden where I live, because we have one too.

Personally I think the UK should be famous for the desserts, they are absolutely fantastic.
 
 
"the British Empire was built on cups of tea"
 
 
The English Language maybe  

I'd put my neck out and say that this is what we're most famous for...
 
 
* for inventing football, but to never have won any meaningful cup on world stage ( always got thrown out of the WC and EC by mighty Germany)
* for not realizing they do not matter any longer as world power,the sun had already set on the empire
* for being the slave of the americans
* for massive larceny (go and visit the British museum when you get there)

*Guiness
 
 
 
^ We didn't enslave, whip, rape or lynch black people. We didn't invade so many countries.

 

Niether did the UK enslave black people, slave markets already existed in Africa and were a major part of the economy in many West African states, the British, Portuguese, French, Spainish and Dutch shamefully exploited these. And essentially you are right, they were treated appallingly and brutalised, much like your Korean and Tibetan slaves.
 
 
colonisation, war, and oppression quite frankly  
 
 
Music.
 
 
Fair play.
 
 
the rolling stones, the beatles and pink floyd  
makes me proud to be british!
