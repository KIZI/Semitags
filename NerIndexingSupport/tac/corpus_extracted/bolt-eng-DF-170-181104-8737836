Barack Hussein Obama is only in this presidential race because he is black.  
 
 
Not sure what being black has to do with it.

But I assume the Citizens of the world thing goes. I assume you said that because Obama called himself a Citizen of the world in Germany at his speech.

Now I do not care if he calls himself a citizen of the world, as long as if he is elected he does not forget he is the president of the united states   and he is there to server us not the world!
 
 
I'm still pondering how he has even made it this far, and the only thing i can come up with is because he is black.

  He is BLACK?   OMG!!! I did not know that! Thank you so much for letting me know!

Here! Take this!   Call me in the morning!

Again, I believe you fail to realize what im getting at. We all want "change" i just want "change" with some substance, not change because "he,she,you,me" are black(no im not voting for mccain). congratulations on your world citizenship by-the-way  
 
 
 
...... because "he,she,you,me" are black.....

 

I am BLACK, now??   This is getting better and better!!!   cause your are s-t-u-p-i-d!  
 
 
Again, you fail to understand the words i wrote. I question if you ever made it past the 8th grade?!

I think it's more a matter of her posts are over YOUR head. She's doing quite an excellent job of condesecendingly patronizing your baseless accusations.

You make the statement Obama is only in the race because he is black.

Where's your proof? Substantiate your allegation.
 
 
At least he didn't yell out, "I love youse all!"

Be thankful the man is a fine speaker

chapstic - Those are the typical responses from people who can't dispute what you say.   Get used to it.

I'm not sure if it's only because he's black...I think the left wing of the party realized that they could control him more than Hillary. The Democratic party has been totally taken over by the left wing extremists and they figured it would be easier to get Barrack to push their agenda.

Oh by the way, be prepared, you will be labled a racist for saying that... although it's probably pretty true.

Obama is not black, he's beige.
 
 
He's in the race because he panders to terrorists, which the left love.
 
 
I don't want a President who is 'citizen of the world'. I want a President who is the servant of the American people, who understands what is in their best interests, and who knows what qualities have made America great and what will make her stronger. I want a President who unequivocably loves his country and sees that it is fundamentally good and who cares that it be safe and protected from all enemies, foreign and domestic. I want a President who understands that a better world is best served by a strong and prosperous United States.

From all I have read, observed, and watched to this point, Obama isn't that President on any single one of those points.
 
 
Being a "citizen of the world" means he rejects US citizenship and thinks it's more important to be at the beck and call of others than of his own people.
 
 
Just like JFK?

Horsesh*t!

Obama understands that the go-it-alone strategy of George the Lesser has been a complete failure. Leadership is the ability to get others to support your goals and Obama has that ability. He will be a great president.

source for this somewhat absurd claim?

remember, he praised america in the same speech
 
 
 
Just like JFK?

 

JFK had his flaws, but as a President he had a great sense of propriety and common sense. As a candidate for the Presidency he would have been appalled at the speech Obama gave in Germany and, even though JFK was a member of the American aristocracy, he would have seen it as arrogant and presumptious as a candidate.

There is a huge difference between a US Senator, even one who is a candidate of the USA, presuming to be the new messiah and promising to be savior to the world, and a presentation from the lawfully elected President of the United States making a good will address in a country he is visiting.

Isn't it amazing that even as a Senator, Obama is inspiring people around the world. Imagine how much good he could do for America as president?

i didnt listen to the entire speech, so could you tell me how he promised to be the worlds savior?
 
 
 
Obama is not black, he's beige.

 

LOL.... I remember Harry Belafonte saying one time (in his younger years).... " I am a good looking white man that has been dipped in caramel"... or something like that!

I suggest you listen to or read the entire speech--hopefully an honest transcript of the speech he gave rather than one that might be 'cleaned up a bit' for the world newspapers.

And then consider this critique of the speech in Spiegel:
 Opinion: No. 44 Has Spoken - International - SPIEGEL ONLINE - News

I find it ridiculous that it's NOTWORTHY when a US presidential candidate is praised for "praising America". What a piece of filth.

Personally I think the Speech he gave in Germany had some good points, and some which pissed me off.

Namely, he talked about continuing to confront terrorism. Which I liked. However I noticed when he did this the Crowd grew silent, and did not applaud.

Then he pissed me off by talking about how we would Not torture, and we would stop being afraid of people "who don't look like us", To which the crowd exploded in applause.

That part pissed me off, because I feel the Idea that we are Torturing people, has been totally over blow, not to say we have not used some possibly improper tactics, and had some incidents of torture, But when Obama said it. it sounded like he was buying into the baseless World view that we are Torturing on mass, and at the same level of real Torturers in the world.

The not being afraid of people who do not look like us comment, IMO, was a jab at people back home who want to stop illegal immigration, and control out borders. As if to say they are afraid of and racist against Hispanics simply because they do not want them entering out country illegally.

Over all I think he took a very safe approach to the speech, and didn't really say much of anything new other than those points.

As far as him only being in the Race because he is black, that is a load of BS. He is in the Race because he ran a great campaign and defeated a HC. End of story. While I oppose him being president, it makes me proud of my nation that he is made it this far and could be president.

now to address the "citizen of the world comment" as I said earlyer I have no problem with it, as long as if he wins, he remembers he is an American first, elected to serve our interest, and a Citizen of the world second.

I agree with most of this, and I am also proud of a country that has grown and evolved so much that artificial barriers based on race, sex, etc. are virtually nonexistent at this time. But I don't buy that Obama 'loves and/or appreciates his country' or sees himself as an American first with a commitment to America. A careful reading of his books, a careful and thoughtful parsing of how he phrases his comments about America and certain people in it, the people he has surrounded himself with in his rise to wealth, power, and fame, and his unashamed pandering to whatever group he addresses does not give me confidence in either his honesty or his integrity.

George W. Bush has been a P.R. disaster and has made some serious errors in judgment coupled with downright incompetence on several fronts. But there is no question that he does love his country and puts its interests first before any other.

Obama is certainly winning the P.R. game, but I think with him we will have easily as much error in judgment and as much incompetence, and that coupled with a view that America is mostly flawed and bad and everybody else is better is a really dangerous combination for America.

Obama is good looking, personable, and mostly likable. I wish I could be more optiministic about him. But I can't.

George Bush has almost single handedly destroyed America. If he loved America he would have resigned long ago.

Obama understands how the world works. America cannot control the world, we need the help of other nations to attain our goals. The perfect example of this are Bush Sr. and Bush Jr. In the first Gulf War, Bush Sr. got on the phone and got the support of many nations around the world, and so the first Gulf War cost us very little. That is called leadership. Bush Jr. took a go-it-alone appoach, even to the point of making fun of our allies. This approach has cost us almost a trillion dollars so far.

Obama is already beloved around the world because he realizes that our allies are important, and the people in those countries are responding to his positiive message. That is also called leadership.
 
 
 
Barack Hussein Obama is only in this presidential race because he is black.  

 

Obama is as much white as he is black.
 
 
blah blah my post got eaten by people having an obamagazim over a speech that damn near calls the United States of America a failure. but oh, it's the "jesus of our time" delivering this speech so it sounds oh so pretty. how can it/he be wrong?

then again, being a "citizen of the world" is a great success. Quit making me jealous.

Ya' think?

The "topic" of your post was abandoned because it's devoid of anything much worth responding to.

You gave us your opinion...that Obama is a candidate because he is Black.

Some people said they don't agree.

Where else could your post possibly take us?

Do you really not understand that?

Where is there any room in your "topic" for an intelligent discussion?

At best this "topic" of yours is a platform for some people to talk about their race issues under the guise of they're doing so as a political discussion.
 
 
 
Obama is as much white as he is black.

 

It is true that he is technically, half-black.
 
 
Some of our society seems to think that there is something unseemly about having pride in one's country or thinking/feeling that it is the best place in the world to live. They consider it a badge of honor to accuse it, demean it, despise it. They see European nations as being purer and more noble and morally superior. And they have no qualms pandering and currying favor from those Europeans by suggesting that even when they don't say it in so many words. Such people think they demonstrate the highest form of patriotism and any other is evil and oppressive.

Some of our society knows that the world is a safer and better place because the United States exists. Some recognize those less commendable aspects of our past and present without dismissing all that is good and commendable. Some know that hundreds of millions if not billions of people would come here to live in a heartbeat and be Americans if they could. Some say the Pledge of Allegiance with gratitude in their heart and feel a rush of positive emotion when they see the flag raised and hear the National Anthem. Such people know that patriotism is appreciation for and determination to preserve a nation that is the best hope of the rest of the world to keep chaos and evil at bay.

Which group did Obama represent in Germany this week? I don't think it was the second.
 
 
 
Being a "citizen of the world" means he rejects US citizenship and thinks it's more important to be at the beck and call of others than of his own people.

 

Thanks for making me go back and read the entire transcript of the speech. It was a meaningful speech that reached out to the world rather than thumb his nose at it, as the president you voted for has been doing for 7 years.

You seems to be just another raving neocon who is reaching to find fault, ANY FAULTS, in Obama. He is not perfect and I don't agree with many of his policies but he does not deserve such biased and undeserved bashing. Come up with something better...

I was a McCain supporter until he became a Bush lapdog as of late, and for one reason. That is to gain the votes of neocons like you. Too little too late...
 
 
 
I don't want a President who is 'citizen of the world'....

There are two important differences. Ronald Reagan was speaking to the United Nations, a body representing a large chunk of the world, as a member of that body. Further he was speaking as President of the United States and by definition a person authorized to speak on behalf of the United States. Further the content of his speech did not demean, disparage, or discredit his country in any way.

Barack Obama is a junior senator from New York having served one year of his first term--the last two years he has been mostly away from the Senate campaigning--and he was not speaking with any authority to speak on behalf of the United States nor was he addressing the United Nations but he was addressing a crowd of hugely anti-Bush, anti-American Germans. And he pandered to their sentiments and earned rousing cheers by in effect putting down his country with little or nothing included to commend it.

Some of us can see the difference.

Some can't.

Or are you of that radical group who adopts messianic figures to worship and allows no criticism of such figures as well as tolerates no opinion other the doctrine they have adopted?

I admit nothing other than I put both speeches within their proper context and drew my conclusions accordingly. Perhaps you can show where Ronald Reagan EVER disparaged or demeaned his country when speaking abroad to anybody about anything? Perhaps you can name any but radical leftwingers of Obama's ilk who have done that?

And then perhaps you can make a case for why it was proper for Obama to do that?
 
 
 
You mean like the right's done with Reagan?

 

I don't know. The right has certainly admired Reagan for being tough with the Europeans and never putting down his country to impress them. Reagan's words have often been quoted to uplift, inspire, and encourage the American people because they always made us know and feel that we need to bow our heads in shame to nobody.

Do you think Obama does that? I don't think Obama does that, but hey, I'm open to be educated about anything. I don't consider ad hominem (not you but others) or red herrings or straw men or non sequiturs to be useful in such education, however.

Talk about turning reality upside down!

A world weary of George Bush diatribes is touched by Obama's optimism, and you say it's bad for America? Oh, please!

Obama got it exactly right when he said that having the world's help will save us billions of dollars that can better be spent at home. The John Wayne go-it-alone approach of the smirking chimp has been a disaster.

ahh, yeah telling a bunch of Germans basically that we Torture, and we fear people that do not look like us is not Disparaging America right. please.  

Obama is not a silver spooner? Didn't he go to a private school, an Ivy League Collage, and an Ivy League Law School. Get real bud.

yea, valuing all human life and not just american is freakin rediculous. everyone knows only american values matter. caring for others shows weekness and emboldens terrorists

you antiobamamanics really are something. you'll find any excuse you can to ridicule him. what was he supposed to say? "i'm an american, and dont really care about the rest of the world. only what is in my country's best interests. remember when we kicked your asses in WW 1 and 2? and by the way, volkswagons cant carry ford's muffler" youre taking an expression meant to reassure the rest of the world as to his views toward the rest of the world and trying to twist it to show he doesnt care about americans, even though the full phrase was "Tonight, I speak to you not as a candidate for President, but as a citizen  a proud citizen of the United States, and a fellow citizen of the world" you are the ones full of shit, and youre making yourself look at partisan hacks who cant think beyond your little elephants talkingpoints

"i'm an american, and dont really care about the rest of the world. only what is in my country's best interests. remember when we kicked your asses in WW 1 and 2? and by the way, volkswagons cant carry ford's muffler" youre taking an expression meant to reassure the rest of the world as to his views toward the rest of the world and trying to twist it to show he doesnt care about americans, even though the full phrase was "Tonight, I speak to you not as a candidate for President, but as a citizen  a proud citizen of the United States, and a fellow citizen of the world" you are the ones full of shit, and youre making yourself look at partisan hacks who cant think beyond your little elephants talkingpoints

 

Jesus, has the Republican party fallen on such hard times, that they have to resort to making shit up?

There was nothing remotely anti-american in Obama's speech. He never said one word about torture. It was a competent, and some would say uplifting speech. He admitted America makes mistakes, while going on to praise our country and our values. What the hell is wrong with saying we make mistakes? Are we so cowardly and child-like that we have to say our country is always perfect? We HAVE made mistakes, and the petulant, arrogant, child like foreign policy of the Bush adminstration has rubbed far too many allies the wrong way. Even Bush himself, in unscripted press conferences, has admitted mistakes publically.

As for the comments about the crowd being comprised of "anti-american" Germans - what a crock. Listent Republicans, the world hates your president. That doesn't mean they hate americans. Check out the american flags those "anti-american" germans were waving at Obama's speech.

I know it hurts, Bushies. Its never fun to be unpopular: the world hates Bush and his kool aid drunk 28% dead enders. That doesn't mean the world can't admire and respect competent americans like Barack Obama, and other enlightened americans.

Either you are a liar, or you did not listen to the speech. His comments about torture got the biggest applause of the speech.

And here they are.

 
Will we acknowledge that there is no more powerful example than the one each of our nations projects to the world? Will we reject torture and stand for the rule of law? Will we welcome immigrants from different lands, and shun discrimination against those who don't look like us or worship like we do, and keep the promise of equality and opportunity for all of our people?

 

Now can you tell me he was not playing on the popular perception in Europe that the US tortures people as a policy? Can you actually say that is not disparaging the US?

There is a difference between renouncing torture, and playing into a German crowds unfounded belief that we torture on mass Kirk, But I do not expect you to get it.

The unfounded belief that we don't mass torture? That's not the point. The point is we should not torture at all.

On this John McCain and I agree.

torture on mass? i dont get how asking 'will we reject torture' equates to saying we torture a ton of people.

if people think we do torture prisoners, should we just pretend we dont and keep denying? i dont think that will solve the problem. the perception will still be there, whether we are torturing or not. making a pledge to not torture, to set an example, would go a bit further to reparing our image than to keep denying

AS do I kirk as do I.

however with everything there is context, and Obama said that in front of a crowd of Germans who believe we do torture on Mass. All you have to do is note that that line got the most applause of the entire speech to know that.

I agree we should not deny it, I just do not think Obama should have said that in front of that crowd. If he wants to talk about the US and torture do it in the US, not in front of a crowd of people who think we torture as a policy.

I stand corrected. He did say the word "torture".

I agree 100% with his statement, don't you? I don't see anything wrong with this. What could possibly be wrong with this statement?

 
Now the world will watch and remember what we do here - what we do with this moment. Will we extend our hand to the people in the forgotten corners of this world who yearn for lives marked by dignity and opportunity; by security and justice? Will we lift the child in Bangladesh from poverty, shelter the refugee in Chad, and banish the scourge of AIDS in our time?

Will we stand for the human rights of the dissident in Burma, the blogger in Iran, or the voter in Zimbabwe? Will we give meaning to the words "never again" in Darfur?

Will we acknowledge that there is no more powerful example than the one each of our nations projects to the world? Will we reject torture and stand for the rule of law? Will we welcome immigrants from different lands, and shun discrimination against those who don't look like us or worship like we do, and keep the promise of equality and opportunity for all of our people?

yeah, he was really playing to the crowd there. saying one sentence that mentioned torture, but was primarily about obeying international law.
remember that it's not just germans who think we torture. many americans feel we do to, as do many people around the world. so would you really be happy if he said it in front of americans? i feel people would be saying the same things, that he is 'playing to the crowds.'

why do i have to be defending obama here? every day i change my mind about who i'm voting for. guess i'm just someone whose judgment isnt so clouded with emotions to find fault or love in everything the man does
 
 
"Will we reject torture and stand for the rule of law?"

Obama is saying what needs to be said, and I applaud him for it.
 
 
Charles, I don't understand your outrage about about Obama's statment about torture. The only way I can understand your outrage, is if I conclude it is a phony, partisan faux outrage.

Obama made a fairly benign statement on torture in front of 200 thousand citizens of a friendly, allied country. It wasn't even an apology. It was a general, benign statement about our values.

Bush, and his spokespersons went on Arab television and groveled and apologized on television to tens of millions of muslims for the abuse of iraqis at Abu Ghraib. If you're so concerned about the US being embarrassed overseas, why didn't that bother you?

Bush stood in front of the Israeli Parliament, and effectively called Obama an appeaser, equivalent to Neville Chamberlein. Where was your outrage then?

Yes, Bush said Obama was an appeaser because he said he would negotiate with Iran. Then Bush sent his own representative to Iran, and spokeschic Dana Perino refused to call it a negotiation. It was ridiculous.

it outrages me because Obama knew damn well who he was talking to when he said it. That comment got the most applause of the whole speech, for a reason. Because the crowd he was talking to was loaded with people who think we use torture as a policy. Obama knew damn well he was playing into that False perception when he said it. IMO anyways.

Did you know what waterboarding was before Bush was elected?

Look kirk, let me speak slow so you get it, I do not deny we have used water boarding and other questionable methods. What I am saying is I think that crowd believes we USE TORTURE all the time, and we USE MUCH worse methods of torture than Water boarding. That is the false perception that I am talking about, and it is the false perception I think Obama knew he was playing into when he said it. I use the massive applause it got as evidence to that effect.

And one of the most important thing our next president must do is change the perception of America around the world. That is how you gain support for our goals, by showing the world that our goals are lofty and worth supporting.

You know Kirk, I don't think Americans are a whole lot smarter than our 'global citizenry', though more pragmatic most of the time. However your premise that our next president can change the perception of America around the world is quite illustrative. If WE elect an inexperienced, charismatic, young, handsome, black man, their opinion will change. I think that says even less for the 'world' than for the US.
 
 
 
and what does obama need from the germans?

 

Their adoration, which he thinks in turns translates into some kind of foreign policy skill. For some reason some Americans think that it's really important for thousands of Europeans LIKE our president.
 
 
Me thinks the Germans were thrilled that we may be getting a President who can pronounce three syllable words.

im surprised it only takes 4 words to win the adoration of 82 million germans.

i dont think people care how other people feel about our president. they care how the rest of the world feels about us. why is that important? because they may support us if we need to take any large action. like, say invade iraq. if europeans hate us, why would they want their government supporting our governments actions?
the waving of american flags in germany sure seems to be a good start. or did they only bring those out once obama mentioned not torturing prisoners?
 
 
 
I think you are making an ass out of yourself by saying "me thinks". Wear in the hell do you live? Shakespeare's back yard ?

Your making a lot of assumptions, and your "outrage" over this type of thing seems to be all directed at (surprise!) a Democrat, and not at republicans. Were you outraged that Bush effectively called Obama an appeaser in front of the Israeli Parliament?

I think Germans are pretty sophisticated. I doubt everyone in that crowd thinks the American Government tortures every person that we detain. But, the fact is, that we have adopted abuse, humiliation, and torture as "enhanced interrogation" techniques, and the International Red Cross has determined that we do in fact abuse and torture detainees. Do we torture all of them? Of course not. But this nation is supposed to hold itself to a higher morality. We hold ourselves out to the world as a beacon of justice and morality. We shouldn't be torturing anyone. The fact that we do engage in torture and abuse, even on limited scales, is nothing short of appalling. And the rightwing in this country has been far too cavalier in justifying, excusing, or otherwise minimizing BushCo's use of torture. Its alarming frankly, that any american would be an apologist for torture and abuse.

I think Europeans are just glad to see a potential american leader who thinks we should honor justice and morality. I don't think they expect perfection. But, I think europeans would at least like to see us not making excuses for torture, or behaving like a rouge state
 
 
He made it this far because of the Hubris of Hillary. That is all.

it's grammar

just sayin'  
 
 
 
Me thinks the Germans were thrilled that we may be getting a President who can pronounce three syllable words.

 

Me thinks it has more to do with is standing for Socialist policies, and his stance on the war in Iraq than anything else, but thats just me.

Europeans hate the Idea the US as the world leader, and they Think Obama will make us less of one. Simple as that IMO.
 
 
 
Your making a lot of assumptions, and your "outrage" over this type of thing seems to be all directed at (surprise!) a Democrat, and not at republicans.

 

Last time I checked I was free to make assumptions and draw conclusions from what People said.

Oh and I have not seen any Republicans go before a crowd of 200k Germans and say something like that, believe me if they did I would be even more outraged. I expect it from a left wing person like Obama, I do not from Republicans. I Expect better than that from them.

I found it even more telling how silent the crowd grew when Obama talked about confronting Terror. You could have heard a pin drop.

Cheer loudly when he talks about torture, Grow dead silent when he talks about confronting Terrorism. I do not need much more than that to know where that crowd stood.

How about the time when Ronald "The Gipper" Regan laid the wreaths at the graves of Nazi S.S. soldiers in 1985? So in fact Ronnie went in front of Germans and laid a wreath on the graves of Nazi's.  Reagan Joins Kohl in Brief Memorial at Bitburg Graves

just sayin'  

 

haha, oops. thats why I never criticise spelling or grammar, and tell others to do the same

Not sure what that has to do with this, at that time I was a kid, and didn't even like Reagan. If I saw him, or another republican, do something like that today I would scream my head off about it.

but then you are not being entirely honest are you, considering only 49 of the 2000 graves were SS. The rest were just common German soldiers who died doing what they were told to do. No?

Then there is the fact that before that he did this.

 
Hours earlier, Mr. Reagan stood before an obelisk at the site of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where 50,000 victims of the Nazis are buried in mass graves under mounds of heather.

''Here they lie,'' Mr. Reagan said in a trembling voice. ''Never to hope. Never to pray. Never to love. Never to heal. Never to laugh. Never to cry.''

 

See I like to know the whole story, and not just focus on the one thing that fits my point of view.

See I think the rest of Obama's speech was well thought out and well spoken. I only take issue with the part about Torture.
 
 
Has anyone here been to Germany. I have. I lived in Belgum for almost 4 years and spent quite a bit of time across the border in Germany. I was also a NATO soldier working side by side with German soldiers. I know a bit about them and their general point of view. IN Europe, especially Germany, they censor violence with far more strictness than we censor sex. You know how we have show about foreign commercials? They have them too, and they include our commercials. They are amazed at how violent we are. They think most Americans carry guns and bully people around. This is from the country that cooked millions of Jews and almost took over Europe!

They are ignorant about their history in WW2. They basically have a black mark over it in the text books, because they are afraid that some people might still believe in Nazi propoganda. I have schooled more than a few Germans about WW2 because they are NOT taught it very extensively.

You might have an image of a Nazi wearing a trench coat wearing a helmet with a point on the top marching as I did before I met them. All I can say is my wake up call was to find that overall the German woman were far more manly than the men were.

These are the people that cheer when we say torture is bad, and grow silent when talking about confronting (violence is bad) terrorism.

Now, I do want to say that I do respect the German people and their culture. I have some German friends that I still keep in touch with. Yet, even they will admit what I just stated.

White House aides have acknowledged that the Bitburg visit is probably the biggest fiasco of Mr. Reagan's Presidency. The visit, which was made at the insistence of Mr. Kohl, was overwhelmingly opposed by both houses of Congress, Jewish organizations, veterans' groups and others.

Up to the last moment, White House officials sought to minimize the effect of the visit. As Mr. Reagan left Bonn this morning for Bergen-Belsen, officials disclosed that the President and Mr. Kohl would be joined at Bitburg by two prominent retired American and German military officers.

Why would we ever need to take any large action? There is no imminent danger. Remember? We can just disband our military and sing songs. If something comes up we can let Europe jump in and rescue us.
