Christopher Caldwell's "Reflections on the Revolution in
Europe: Immigration, Islam, and the West" is a hot book presented
under a cool, scholarly title. To observe that Caldwell's rhetoric
is "hot" is not to say that it is aggrieved or unruly. On the
contrary, Caldwell, a senior editor at The Weekly Standard and a
columnist for The Financial Times, compiles his arguments
patiently, twig by twig, and mostly with lucidity and intellectual
grace and even wit.

But they are arguments one is not used to hearing put so baldly,
at least from the West's leading political journalists. Primary
among them are these: Through decades of mass immigration to
Europe's hospitable cities and because of a strong disinclination
to assimilate, Muslims are changing the face of Europe, perhaps
decisively. These Muslim immigrants are not so much enhancing
European culture as they are supplanting it. The products of an
adversarial culture, these immigrants and their religion, Islam,
are "patiently conquering Europe's cities, street by street."

Caldwell is a vivid writer, and like an action-movie hero he
walks calmly away from his own detonations while fire swirls behind
him. "Imagine that the West, at the height of the Cold War, had
received a mass inflow of immigrants from Communist countries who
were ambivalent about which side they supported," he writes.
"Something similar is taking place now."

Muslim cultures "have historically been Europe's enemies, its
overlords, or its underlings," he deposes. "Europe is wagering
that attitudes handed down over the centuries, on both sides, have
disappeared, or can be made to disappear. That is probably not a
wise wager."

These kinds of ideas have been articulated before, of course, by
writers including the Princeton Islamic scholar Bernard Lewis -- who
has said that, by the end of this century, "Europe will be part of
the Arabic west, of the Maghreb" -- the Somali-born Dutch feminist
Ayaan Hirsi Ali ("Infidel"), Lee Harris ("The Suicide of
Reason"), Bruce Bawer ("While Europe Slept") and the combustible
journalist Oriana Fallaci.

But Caldwell's book is the most rigorous and plainspoken
examination of Muslim immigration in Europe to date, a sobering
book that walks right up to, if never quite crossing, the line
between being alarming and being alarmist.

There are many strains to Caldwell's argument, too many to fully
tease out here. Suffice it to say, up front, that Caldwell is not
anti-immigration. He traces the historical movements of various
peoples across continents and nationalities and notes both
successes and failures. But there has been nothing, he suggests,
quite like the recent influx of Muslims into Europe -- he refers to
it as "a rupture in its history."

"In the middle of the 20th century, there were virtually no
Muslims in Western Europe," Caldwell writes. "At the turn of the
21st, there were between 15 and 17 million Muslims in Western
Europe, including 5 million in France, 4 million in Germany, and 2
million in Britain."

These immigrants are further swamping Europe demographically, he
adds, because of their high fertility rates. He points to small
facts as well as large ones. In Brussels in 2006, the seven most
common given boys' names "were Mohamed, Adam, Rayan, Ayoub, Mehdi,
Amine, and Hamza."

The problem, in Caldwell's view, is less about sheer numbers
than cultural divergence. What's happening in Europe is not the
creation of an American-style melting pot, he writes, because
Muslims are not melting in. They are instead forming what he calls
"a parallel society." Newcomers to England now listen to Al
Jazeera, not the BBC. They are hesitant to serve in their adopted
country's militaries. (As of 2007, Caldwell notes, there were only
330 Muslims in Britain's armed forces.) Worse, these immigrants are
bringing anti-Semitism back to Europe.

Caldwell carefully observes the riots that spread in ethnic
neighborhoods across France in 2005, during which thousands of cars
were burned. "Who were these rioters?" he asks. "Were they
admirers of France's majority culture, frustrated at not being able
to join it on equal terms? Or did they simply aspire to burn to the
ground a society they despised, whether for its exclusivity, its
hypocrisy, or its weakness?"

The most chilling observation in Caldwell's book may be that the
debate over Muslim immigration in Europe is one that the continent
can't openly have, because anyone remotely critical of Islam is
branded as Islamophobic.

Europe's citizens -- as well as its leaders, its artists and,
crucially, its satirists -- are scared to speak ,because of a
demonstrated willingness by Islam's fanatics to commit violence
against their perceived opponents. There exists, Caldwell writes, a
kind of "standing fatwa" against Islam's critics.

Caldwell, who is also a contributing writer for The New York
Times Magazine, finds things to praise about Islamic society, but
he is unsparing about its deficiencies.

"The Islamic world is an economic and intellectual basket case,
the part of the potentially civilized world most left behind by
progress," he writes. He adds, devastatingly: "Spain translates
more foreign books in a year than all the Arab-speaking countries
have translated since the reign of Caliph Mamoun in the ninth
century."

"Reflections on the Revolution in Europe" is more descriptive
than proscriptive. Better intermediaries between East and West are
sorely needed, Caldwell implies during his thumping takedown of the
Swiss Muslim academic Tariq Ramadan, whom he accuses of placating
Western audiences while encouraging jihad through coded language.

Among Caldwell's few heroes is the French president, Nicolas
Sarkozy, who refers to himself as a "demanding friend" of Muslims
in France and who, as France's interior minister, reduced the
number of first-time residency permits the country offered.
Sarkozy, the author writes, is moving beyond "uncritical
multiculturalism."

Caldwell's book is well researched, fervently argued and morally
serious. It may serve as a dense, footnoted wake-up call to many of
Europe's liberal democracies. It is also a worst-case overview of
Muslim immigration into Europe, and it is possible that Caldwell
overstates his case.

On July 26, The Guardian newspaper in London published the
results of a new Gallup poll taken in the European Union, one whose
findings seemed to show that a mass radicalization of the
continent's Muslims is not taking place, as was feared from 2004 to
2006, in the wake of terrorist attacks in London and Madrid.

The Guardian also quoted Sarkozy's security adviser, Alain
Bauer, who took a sanguine view of Muslim immigration: "We
estimate about 10 percent of our Islamic population are in a
dynamic of rejection of the West and Europe, 10 percent are more
European than the Europeans, and about 80 percent are in the
middle, just trying to get by." Bauer added, "The concern is less
home-grown or imported terrorists, but states such as Iran."

That, Caldwell would say, may well be wishful thinking -- or yet
another example of a public figure afraid to say what he really
thinks. For Caldwell, the fundamental issue is also, more
centrally, about irrevocable societal transformation.

It is hard to argue with his ultimate observation about Europe
today: "When an insecure, malleable, relativistic culture"
(Europe's) "meets a culture that is anchored, confident, and
strengthened by common doctrines" (Islam's), "it is generally the
former that changes to suit the latter."
