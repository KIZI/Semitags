Forget about Dorsey. Chris Long is a freak and will be a dominant
force on d for years. Build around him.

Cowher will start with the d.

Because we all know how dominant those ACC offensive lines are.... Â while he
made a couple plays, he didn't do much else in the ACCCG, and the Hokies OL
is mediocre at best.
