Brady has revenge on his mind. My prediction for NJ.....PAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!
 
 
Who do I want to win? Let's see, which one is "my team"? Oh, neither one! I'll be rooting for both of them to lose!

 
 
 
Giants 23 New England 21.

And I predict the roof will remain closed for the duration.

Giants will kick a game winning FG with 13 seconds on the clock.
 
 
Washington Redskins - next year. You heard it here first. This year? Giants.
 
 
I think it will end up being Giants 41, Patriots 21. The Patriots have no answer for the Giants ground game. The only way the Patriots can win is if they are leading by a substantial margin early in the game and forces the Giants to become one dimensional. If the Giants can run the ball with their 2 big backs; forget about it. It's going to be a long, long....LONG day for the Patriots.
 
 
If the Patriots score more than 17 points, they will win.

If they score 17 or less, they will lose.
 
 
 
If the Patriots score more than 17 points, they will win.

If they score 17 or less, they will lose.

 

Here is the box score from Their last Meeting:

 
Source: NFL.com New York Giants New England Patriots
First downs 17 22
Third down efficiency 8/16 7/14
Fourth down efficiency 1-1 0-2
Total yards 338 274
Passing yards 247 229
Passing  completions/attempts 19/34 29/48
Rushing yards 91 45
Rushing attempts 26 16
Yards per rush 3.5 2.8
Penalties-yards 4-36 5-35
Sacks against-yards 3-8 5-37
Fumbles-lost 2-0 1-1
Interceptions thrown 1 0
Time of possession 30:27 29:33

 

If those red numbers are higher on Sunday than they were 4 years ago; the Giants will be victorious. There is no reason to think they won't be unless New England can put up some crooked numbers on the score board early in the game.

I beg to differ.

Looking at the regular season alone, the Pats gave up less rushing yards per game than the Giants (117 vs 121) and they were ranked 17th and 19th respectively.

Passing defense showed that both teams were miserable ranked 30th and 31st.

The Giants had more sacks and the Pats gave up more sacks, so that may be where the difference would lie.
 
 
Superbowl predictions

Barring localized disaster, the fall of the United States or global Armageddon I predict, with 100% certainty there will be a Superbowl this year, next year and for many years to follow.

If they score 17 or less, they will lose.

We'll see.

I think it will be one of those Super Bowls where Obama wants to call to congratulate the Giants on their win but has to wait because he doesn't want to interrupt the 2nd quarter.

They can't score if they aren't on the field so if the Giants can control theball, they will destroy the Patriots. Which is why the Patriots have to score early, score often, and force the Giants to up their tempo.

Your statistics? Well, the Pats got to play the Bills twice, the Dolphins twice, the Jets twice...quick...name any of the starting running backs on those teams. True for the NFC East as well by the way. I don't see where you can give the Pats any advantage in the category though.

The Giants running game is best up the middle which also happens to be the teeth of the Patriots defense. Running at Wilfork seems a lil' nutty, IMO. The Giants will run but not much. Coughlin is going to throw the ball, and throw it a lot.

On the other hand, expect a lot more draw plays to Woodhead than usual to neutralize the Giants pass rush and set up the play action.

If NE can run the ball effectively they got a chance Sunday.

Why are you two picking the Giants to score over 40 points, a feat which they were unable to accomplish all season, against the Patriots, who did not give up more than 34 points in a game?

This season, against the 1st ranked offense and against the 3rd ranked offense, the Giants gave up 49 and 38 points, respectively. Why do you think they will fair much better against the 2nd ranked offense?

Call it the Manning syndrome (Peyton, not Eli). Unless the Patriots get out to a big lead, the giants are going to run the hell out of the ball and control the clock. When Brady gets back onto the field, they'll roll coverage to Gronk and get 1 or 2 pick sixes. If I'm Belechik (sp?), I'm coming out with flea flickers, half-back passes, onside kicks, fake punts, etc...

The Patriots O-line and D-Line are good, not great. They needed a missed field goal to get past the Ravens and win by 3 points.

Eli is a more mobile QB - can extend plays.

Peyton is about as mobile as the Statue of Liberty.

So Tebow is better than Eli using that bizarre yardstick.

If they score 17 or less, they will lose.

I'm here, pained and hung over, depressed and disappointed, to admit that both my Superbowl predictions were wrong.

I'm not going to discuss the first one past this sentence because really... I just don't want to talk about it.

With that said, I really thought Madonna did a great job during the half-time show. I must say I was pleasantly surprised and entertained by her performance.

The company we held during the game was some of the best. The food we cooked and served was D-licious and the spirits we drank were a plenty. Even though we lost the big game, this Superbowl weekend was a lot of fun and I'm looking forward to next years.

Now... how many months until the start of the new season?

In what world are feild goals nonexistant?

Had Tommy gotten in FG range the drive prior to the Giants TD, made the FG, then it would have been 21-20 as a final...

Am I missing something?

Edit: In fact, that would have FORCED the giants to go for the TD that NE let them score instead of a just getting into FG range and running out the clock...
 
 
 
New Jersey 14 New England 56

MVP Brady

 

I did not see this thread saturday so just to prove that I did pick The Giants to win here is the proof and the reasons why. The only thing I was wrong on is that The Giants defense did not really cause Brady too many problems and I thought the crowd would be extremely loud when The Patriots had the ball but it was actually neautral crowd.

 Anyone pulling for NY in SuperBowl? 

hate the Cheatriots because Belecheck is so freaking over rated.Without Tom Brady he is nothing.Brady resurrected his career.His first year in New England when he had Drew Bledsoe as his starting quarterback he had a losing season,then Brady came on and the rest is history. Also being objective and getting past my hatred of the patriots,this is why I think the Giants will win as well.

I see The Giants winning this from the patriots again.This team is just like that team from 2007,coming on strong at the end of the season and playing well when it needed to to get into the playoffs.Their defense is looking great and that will be too much for tom brady to handle.Three other reasons I expect the giants to win.

1.they own the patriots beating them when they were previously unbeaten in the superbowl two years ago and this year on the road at foxboro and they did not have one of their first string receivers then or their featured running back either due to injurys.this time they have them both and that will be too much for the suspect pats defense to handle.

2.The patriots have not played a GOOD football team in the playoffs yet.The Broncos? what a joke.Teabow has been exposed that when he faces a GOOD team,he is a horrible quarterback. and come on the Ravens with Joe Flacco at quarterback? get serious.that team will never get to the superbowl with flacco at quarterback. Plus more than anything,The Patriots shouldnt be there in the superbowl.

People can blame the loss all they want on the ravens kicker but even if he makes that field goal all that does is send them into overtime which guaranteed them nothing.It never should have come down to that kick.That reciever in the end zone dropped a pass that was knocked out of his arms that a GOOD receiver would have hung on to so since the ravens are the team that should be there and really are the better team defensively,the pats have finally met their match.

3.this game is going to take place in Indianapolis.Colts fans have first shot at the tickets and you got to remember,this is the city that loves and worships Peyton Manning and not only do they hate Tom Brady and the patriots,Peytons little brother Eli is playing there so most fans will naturally be rooting for little brother Eli to win especialy since the Giants fan base travels extremely well much better than the patriots fan base does so it will seem like a home game for the giants and a road game for the patriots which is a big edge for the Giants.
__________________

Just think,if the patriots dont have those key penaltys and the Giants dont recover that key fumble,right now everybody in the world would be saying Belecheck is the greatest coach ever.Hopefully this superbowl losss will shut all that talk up for along time now.
