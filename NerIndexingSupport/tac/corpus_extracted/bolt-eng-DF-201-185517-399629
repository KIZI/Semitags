Now we know who's part of this murderous plot, what action should we take?
 
 
Send them a lovely fruitcake. And a shrubbery. Not too expensive.

It was particularly amusing to watch the Bollyn-Smith-Hufschmidt axis tear itself apart as each realized that both of the others were Secret Joo Agents.

And to think  they started out as the Only True Truthers  :
By the end of 2006, it became obvious that the "truth seekers" had separated into two distinct groups. The Zionist agents are completely avoiding Christopher Bollyn, Eric Hufschmid, and Daryl Bradford Smith.

They justify the avoidance of us by claiming we are "anti-Semites" or "Holocaust Deniers", but the real reason they avoid us is because we are exposing Zionism. They don't want people to hear what we have to say.

[...]

Now compare that to what comes from Alex Jones, Ted Gunderson, Anthony Hilder, Mark Lane, Mark Weber, Curt Maynard, Webster Tarpley, the antiwar groups, the veterans groups, the Institute for Historical Review, Don Harkins of The Idaho Observer, and all other investigators and truth seekers.

The three of us (Bollyn, Hufschmid, and Smith) are the newcomers. Yet in the span of a few years, we have produced more important material that all of the other people put together. And all of those other investigators try to ignore us.

There are not many ways to explain this. Either the other people are incredibly stupid, or they are Zionist agents.

A shrubbery?

You must be a Bush-lover.
 
 
As part of the Vast Rightwing Neo-Con Illuminati Skull and Bones KFC Directorate To Fabricate Evidence of A Large-Scale Terrorist Attack (or VRNCISnBKFCDtFEoALSTA,) I was presented, as we all were, with both a tasteful wooden plaque commemorating our efforts and a small miniature indoor ficus.

Working for the nWo has its perks, I'll tell ya - not the least of which is the nice timeshares in Boca Raton.
 
 
i didn't make the list? kee-rist what is this world coming to?

You can tell when a movement or Revolution is failing, be it a violent uprising or a political organization: They turn on themselves and attack parts of themselves.

Why? Because they desperately need a victory. Any victory. Attacking the thing you are actually rebelling against has proved futile so you attack what you know you can defeat.
 
 
Well, you know what they say about revolutionaries.

They have no idea what they want.
They can only agree on what they don't.

First he must find another shrubbery and when he hast found the shrubbery, place it beside the other shrubbery, but a bit higher with a nice path running down the centre. A path! A path! Then, cut down the biggest tree in the forest with a kipper.

Some quotations:

''If 9/11 is ever exposed, we must investigate all of the 9/11 Truth Seekers. Almost all of them seem to be working for the criminal network.'' -  Darryl Bradford Smith, Truther 

''All “leaders” in the “911truth” movement should be required to take the lie detector test.'' -  Rick Seigel, Truther 

''A truth movement filled with disinformation artists and FBI-funded infiltrators'' -  Greg Szymanski, Truther 

''99% of the 9-11 truth seekers are worthless.'' -  Eric Huffschmidt, Truther 

''Is it possible the “truth movement” has been run by the 9/11 perpetrators since day one?'' -  C B Brooklyn, Truther 

''9/11 Truth is a cesspit... There is not a shadow of a doubt that 9/11 “Truth” was planned simultaneously with 9/11 itself. That is why you have so many conflicting stories, points of view, arguments and discussions, etc. The Trolls were pre-ordained and planned. So were the major WebSites (e.g. 911Truth.org). It is a known fact that any grouping of five or more will be infiltrated.'' -  Veronic Chapman, Truther 

I think I shall Stundie the last one. " Any grouping of five or more "?

Priceless.
 
 
Don't forget to add Mike Carter to that list: "Jews, jews jews jews".

Hmm...tough call.
 
 
Captain Bob, Craig and Aldo won't be too happy about being left off this list! Their "any PR is good PR" approach to life just took a hit!
 
 
 
''99% of the 9-11 truth seekers are worthless.'' -  Eric Huffschmidt, Truther 

 

That's one statement we can mostly agree with.

Pretending for a second lie detectors work, that would be hilarious.

Mostly? There is a 1% margin error in Eric's quote.

Arabesque has called them all disinfo, and they have returned the favor.

Reminds me of the Benny Hill version of the French Revolution, with all of the truthers trying to be Robespierre.
 
 
More like a Spartacus kind of thing, I think.

"I'm the only real truther!" "No, I'm the only real truther!" "No, I'm the only real truther!"

(I don't think anyone's mentioned the Judean Popular Front yet. Maybe nobody will.)

''99% of the 9-11 truth seekers are worthless.'' -  Eric Huffschmidt, Truther 

 

This is the single most impressive statement ever made by a conspiracy liar. He is off by only 1%.
 
 
LOL

 
Introducing the producers:

Dylan Avery, Corey Rowe, Jason Bermas

-3 pot heads:

 
everytime I see Jason he as that Deliverance inbred make you squeal like a pig look on his face.
He really should try out for the Howard Stern show.

''If 9/11 is ever exposed, we must investigate all of the 9/11 Truth Seekers. Almost all of them seem to be working for the criminal network.'' - Darryl Bradford Smith, Truther

 
I wonder if DBS would investigate himself.  
 
 
It's amazing that they can spot the fallacies in other people's world but then totally miss it in their own. I mean can anyone name this fallacy?

 
As further evidence of the Hufschmid - Murdoch connection, consider that Hufschmid promotes the dubious "Apollo moon landings were a hoax" conspiracy theory on his websites, and Murdoch's Fox TV network ran a documentary entitled "Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land on the Moon?" in February and March of 2001. The plan was to discredit 9/11 skeptics as "crazy conspiracy theorists", establishing the groundwork in the months leading up to the attacks.

 
 
 
 
Pretending for a second lie detectors work, that would be hilarious.  

 
Ugh. I am NOT going down that road again.  
 
 
 
(I don't think anyone's mentioned the Judean Popular Front yet. Maybe nobody will.)

 
 Here's what 911review.com thinks of 911review.org .

Splitters!
 
 
"You can't be part of 911review.org."

"What?!? Why not?"

"You've gotta really hate the goverment."
 
 
I'm working on an article on it, because this is one aspect of the Truth phenomenon that's been insufficiently documented (because debunkers don't object to it, 'cos it's funny).

I have a theory, which seems to be borne out by Truther rhetoric.

Every Truther finds that his own ideas are luminously, beautifully obvious when he looks at the evidence. I think the technical term is idee fixe. You just have to look, and the pattern you get when you join the dots is utterly self-evident. This is why the classic Truther warcry is "do your own research!!!" Because you just have to look.

Hence, you can only be a mere sheeple by not looking at the evidence at all and getting all your information from Fox News. Anyone who looks at the evidence and says that he can't see what the Truther is seeing is a liar, ergo a shill.

Now this applies just as much to the quirks of the Truthers own particular version of the Truth as it does to the Truth in general.

Hence, for example, the line from Bollyn-Smith-Hufschmidt:
There are not many ways to explain this. Either the other people are incredibly stupid, or they are Zionist agents. In their world, the Sinister Jooish Plot is undeniable to anyone who's looked at the evidence and is not severely retarded. They have shown their fellow Truthers the evidence. They are not retarded (they aren't, lay off the jokes) ergo they are Zionist shills.

Here's Hufschmidt again:
Webster Tarpley denies that Israel plays any role in world corruption. Supposedly, the Bush family, and a few other mysterious people, are behind the world's corruption, and Israel is an innocent victim. Tarpley is too intelligent to not realize that he is lying. He must be a member of some criminal network. Of course, the same applies to their attitude to debunkers. So, for example, a couple of days ago on these forums:
Those who passionately attempt to protect the criminals actually responsible for this crime, like Mackey, are traitors who should be behind bars. He's far too intelligent to honestly believe the crap he's trying to sell. It's beyond ludicrous!

The CIA has numerous geeks like Mackey, extremely bright folks, who gladly compromise their integrity to serve their masters. (He means Ryan Mackay, of course.)

The reasoning is simple. Anyone who's not retarded agrees with me. You are not retarded, therefore you agree with me. Therefore, when you say you don't agree with me, you are lying. Ergo, you work for the CIA.

I fit ALL of those criteria!

Where's my coffee mug? Where's my company jet? Where's my parking space at the Farm? The level three keycard access to the secret mountain retreat known only as...The Meadows?

I feel so ripped off.
 
 
Dr Adequate would you be open to putting together an illustration of which truther groups hate which? That would sum things up and provide buckets of lols.

That would probably look like a Jackson Pollock painting.

It would be easier to do a diagram showing who's still on speaking terms with whom.

By now, that's probably down to Dylan Avery and Jason Bermas.
 
 
It's a lot like the Ku Klux Klan, with dozens of groups, (most of which have membership in the single digits) claiming to be the only true Klan.

That reminds me of R.Mackey's thread on  Irreducible Delusions .

I'm not speaking for anyone but myself, but in my CT days I didn't sleep a lot. By the third day of being awake a whole bunch of pieces suddenly start fitting together.

Eventually it started sinking in maybe it wasn't because I was so much MORE aware of reality at that point.

Thank you. Ah yes, wingtv.

Well, they're telling it like it is:
The first thing that is very apparent from these results is that nobody trusts anybody in this field! Quite so. You get that a lot with paranoid idiots.

Wingtv have of course been exposed as disinfo themselves,  along with practically everyone else .

The primary objectives of the CIA FAKES are:

-- To leverage the Fakes into position as the leadership/spokespersons
for the 9/11 skeptics movement.
-- To splinter and divide that movement.
-- To promote lame, tame and/or booby-trapped questions about 9/11.
-- To be sufficiently over-the-top as to prevent the 9/11 issue getting
any traction in the media or left-wing.
-- To ensure that the movement would not have a politically-active
leadership capable of turning it into an effective political lobby campaign.

 

Man we're some sooper smarties here at the NWO. Couldn't have played out better if someone had simply made up that list after the fact to explain away why their stupid movement has been such a dismal failure.

Oh, wait a tic...
 
 
Wow, this really is a game of "No Real Truther" execpt with the adition that any "Not a real Truther" is CIA, lol.

I thought it was bad when the Truthers were calling us debunkers CIA, it seems like they just call anyone that isn't them CIA. Drat, that really devalues the badge of Honor man....
