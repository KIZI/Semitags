Ad blitz credited for rise in tourism
      Comerica Mich. quarterly index gains 3 points

Michigan's tourism industry is holding its own in an economic
downturn that's forcing many travelers to cut back on discretionary
spending.

Comerica Bank's Michigan Tourism Index rose three points, to 91,
in the second quarter of 2009 following a one point gain in the
first quarter. Although the index has rebounded from its fourth
quarter low, the average for the first half of 2009 is still three
points below the average for all of 2008.

"The Michigan tourism industry definitely has outperformed the
overall state economy thus far this year, perhaps reflecting in
part Michigan's award-winning ad campaign that has been playing
across the county," Dana Johnson, chief economist at Comerica,
said in a statement.

The base for comparison was 2004, which was measured as 100.

Knowing this would be a difficult year for travelers, Michigan
tourism officials launched a $10 million national advertising
campaign in March, touting the state's attractions and amenities.
The national campaign, the first for Travel Michigan -- the state's
tourism advertising agency -- was broadcast on 15 cable channels,
including the Golf Channel, Travel Channel, Food Network and HGTV.
It ended in June.

Sales numbers won't be available until the end of the year, said
George Zimmermann, vice president of Travel Michigan, but July was
the best month ever, in terms of volume, for the state's tourism
Web site, www.michigan.org.

Of all states' tourism Web sites, Michigan's had a 14 percent
market share.

Tourism is considered one of Michigan's top three industries,
generating $18.1 billion each year. Tourism generates $874 million
in state taxes and employs 192,000 workers statewide. Zimmermann
said that every dollar Michigan spends on out-of-state advertising
generates $2.82 for state coffers.

Comerica's report was "encouraging" to Peter Fitzsimons,
executive director of the Petoskey Area Convention and Visitors
Bureau.

"It takes a while to get solid evidence that (the campaign) is
working, but we're definitely seeing more out-of-state license
plates," he said.
