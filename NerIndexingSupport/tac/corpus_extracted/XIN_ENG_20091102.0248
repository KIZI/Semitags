The number of crimes in San Salvador had been lowered in October with daily
victims being reduced from 16 to 14, the country's Civil National Police (PNC)
reported Monday.

The security improvement was attributed to the strengthened cooperation between
police and the army in fighting against crimes.

Mauricio Ramirez Landaverde, PNC assistant director, said the government planned
to consolidate police-military cooperation against crimes in the face of high
rates of violence in the country.

"If we have more support from the armed forces, it will be welcomed," Ramirez
said.

The PNC said both the number of extortion cases and daily crime victims were
slightly down in October.

Ramirez said violent crimes reached "very notable peaks in June and July." As
the police gave priority to combating crimes in the public security area, "the
situation began to change (for the better) from August."
