LOL!

It's like you little girls are looking for some idiot critic's blessing to
continue to live.
Would bad reviews make you cry and cower in some dark corner?

Who gives a fuck!

Van Halen put on a great show.
Who cares what some Britney Spears, newspaper writer, fan cares.
Oh wait ... apparently you Van Halen Hens do.

Pathetic.

The first show should've been free entry and they passed around a hat. That
red one (Didn't Tom Petty use that prop?)!

How convenient that fans AND critics alike didn't notice (and mindlessly
walked away happy) that Van Halen didn't offer up ONE ORIGINAL NEW SONG???

Watching VH live, expensive! Hearing the same old songs, boring. Watching the
tour DVD at home next year for $3.00, priceless!
