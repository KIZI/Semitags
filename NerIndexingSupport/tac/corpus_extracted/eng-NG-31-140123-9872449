Hawks by at least 14, it's good to play six games against three of the most
pathetic teams in the NFL.

Could say the same thing about the Patriots. They play in a weak division,
though the Jets did manage to beat the Steelers. Arizona did too I guess..
fear the pathetic.

The AFC West aint all that great either.  And while we're at it, take a
look at the NFC South.  Take away the leader in any division and the rest
pretty much suck.

The current system has definitely created a strong level mediocre parity.

i feel Holmgren has no game plan for Arizona, The Hollywood Seahawks
have been spending to much time enjoying the glory of there last win.
Arizona has a running game and we don`t.. Arizona will show up in
Seattle ready to play football and won`t... i believe we will start out
slow (like always) and will fall short at the end : (  Arizona wins
again!!!!!!.. .. i wont waste my time predicting the score because it
really doesn`t matter when you lose now does it????

Dude, you are soooooooooooooo wrong!

Holmgren for all the very few shortcomings he may have is a consummate
professional who is able to learn from his past mistakes. He mentioned in
his press conference that they had the same situation last year where they
were 8 - 4 and looked like they had a comfortable path to the division
championship and then lost 3 out of their last 4 to barely make the
playoffs. You seriously think he and his staff aren't making damned sure the
team doesn't repeat that mistake this year by overlooking Arizona? He's
acutely aware of the situation and the possibility that the team might have
a letdown. Take it to the bank that he's not going to let that happen again.
That's why he's one of the best ever and on his way to the hall of fame.
He'll have a great game plan, a fired up team, and the 12th man behind him
as Arizona comes into the loudest stadium and most devastating false start
hellhole in the league to try and stay alive down the stretch.

The Seahawks will play Arizona tough and play like there's no tomorrow.
Everyone said Philly had more to play for last week but I saw the team shake
off those early morning East coast blues and play a damned fine game like
they wanted to be champions. Tatupu couldn't practice all week because of
pain but came out and played like the best MLB in the league should play on
game day. Players take their cure from guys like him.

This year, Arizona is so screwed. This ain't the 2006 Seahawks.

Whatever you want to worry about, don't worry that Seattle won't show up
ready to play. Thats ludicrous! If Arizona does win, they'll have earned it
because Seattle isn't going to give the game away like you suggest.

You need to get real John Doe (pun intended)!

Yes Arizona has a running game, but its not *so* good as to keep up with the
Hawks offense facing an injury riddled secondary (24th in the league). Once
the Seahawks can establish a lead of more than 10 points (which I believe
will happen quick) Arizona wont be able to stick with that running game.
Then they will have to go to a passing game that is also seriously banged
up. I give Arizona a lot of credit, and I think they will be a major
contender next season, and possibly a wildcard this year. But its not how
good you are overall, its how good you are that day. The Cardinals will be
hurting as they enter Qwest this Sunday, and they aren't that good on the
road this year in the first place.

This is a really hard one to guess. I am concerned about how we've
come up short against AZ almost every year, so it worries me, but if
the D can come close to last week's effort it should be in the bag.
