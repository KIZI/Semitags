Circle May 18 on your calendar. What happens that day will tell us much about
the mood of the electorate heading into the November midterm elections.

That third Tuesday in May is the de facto Super Tuesday of the 2010 cycle, with
a slew of contested Senate primaries and special elections sure to be
interpreted ad nauseam for omens of the races this fall.

To wit:

-- Pennsylvania: Sen. Arlen Specter, D-Pa., faces voters for the first time
since switching from Republican to Democrat in the spring of 2009. He's opposed
in the primary by Rep. Joe Sestak, D-Pa., who has enough money to combat
Specter's always well-funded campaigns. To be seen is whether Specter's strong
support from the entirety of the state and national Democratic party _ up to and
including the White House _ will work in his favor or, in the anti-establishment
mood that appears to be at work nationally, whether it will be a net neutral or
even a negative.

House strategists will have their hands full, too _ particularly with the
special election to replace the late Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., in the state's
southwestern 12th district. Former Murtha district director Mark Critz will face
off against businessman Tim Burns, a Republican, in the only district in the
country that was carried by Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., in the 2004 presidential
race and by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., four years later.

-- Arkansas: Liberals nationwide have invested their hopes (and money) in Lt.
Gov. Bill Halter, who is challenging Sen. Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark., for the
Democratic nomination. Halter has attacked Lincoln for her moderation _
particularly on health care _ and his campaign has been financially fueled by a
seven-figure infusion from four liberal interest groups. Organized labor has
also pledged to spend millions of dollars to defeat Lincoln, whose poll numbers
over the past year have plummeted for both the primary and general election.
Liberals have revolted against their own before. Will Arkansas 2010 be a rerun
of the defeat of Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., at the hands of Ned Lamont, a
wealthy businessman, in the 2006 Connecticut Democratic primary?

-- Kentucky: In the Bluegrass State, the national focus is on the Republican
Senate primary, where businessman Rand Paul _ yes, he is the son of Texas
congressman and 2008 presidential candidate Ron Paul _ is running against Trey
Grayson, Kentucky's secretary of state. At the start of the race to replace
retiring Sen. Jim Bunning, R-Ky., Paul was seen as a sideshow, a small bump on
Grayson's road to the nomination. No longer. Paul, using the online fundraising
network pioneered by his father, is at financial parity with Grayson, and
polling suggests the two are running neck and neck.

A Paul victory would be the nascent "tea party" movement's first major
establishment scalping. Overshadowed _ although it shouldn't be _ by the Paul-
Grayson fight is the Democratic Senate primary, where Lt. Gov. Daniel Mongiardo
and state Attorney General Jack Conway are competing. Conway leads in the money
chase but Mongiardo has the edge in polling on the race.

Oregon: Far lower-profile than some other contests on May 18 but no less
important are the gubernatorial primaries in the Beaver State. On the Democratic
side, former governor John Kitzhaber is trying to reclaim the office he held for
eight years in the 1990s, but former secretary of state Bill Bradbury stands in
the way. (Kitzhaber isn't the only former governor trying to get back to his old
office; former four-term GOP governor Terry Branstad is re-running in Iowa).
National Republicans are hoping former NBA player _ and Yale grad _ Chris Dudley
emerges from a crowded primary field, thinking that his outsider profile could
give them a chance in the Democratic-tilting state. Dudley has to hope his
political eye is more accurate than his shooting eye _ he was a lifetime 46
percent free throw shooter.

Christmas is coming late (or is it early?) for political junkies.

On Wednesday, C-SPAN will launch a searchable video library that includes all of
its programming dating to 1987.

Which means that, if you were so inclined, you could watch every floor speech of
the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., or relive President Obama's speech at the
2007 Iowa Democratic Party Jefferson-Jackson Dinner.

Of the video library, C-SPAN co-president Susan Swain said: "Its extensive
holdings will allow the public to see how elected officials, politicians,
journalists, experts, authors and other opinion leaders present themselves on
the issues of the day and over time."
