This team is fun to watch.

I think Alex Smith came out of a similar
offense in Utah.  Why not run this crazy
crap ?  At least it would be fun.

p.s.  it is very possible TTU could be the sf 49ers.

Well, the run 'n shoot (which has some similarities to the spread) used to
be the rage in the NFL, until the defenses figured it out.  It still works
well in Hawaii with June Jones.

A lot of things that work well in college don't work as well in the pros.
Although I agree it would be a lot more interesting.

I watched both games and Texas Tech was fun to watch, but the
UH/Nevada game beats them all for drama.  Two years ago, the fans were
about ready the lynch the kicker and Friday, the kicker ices the game.
