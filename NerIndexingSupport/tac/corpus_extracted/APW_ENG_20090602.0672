Top-seeded Dinara Safina overcame her first test at this year's French Open, coming back to beat Victoria Azarenka of Belarus 1-6, 6-4, 6-2 Tuesday and reach the semifinals.

Safina had lost a total of five games through four entire matches at Roland Garros, the lowest total at any Grand Slam tournament since 1994.

But the ninth-seeded Azarenka broke Safina in the opening game and took the first set in only 23 minutes. Safina went ahead 2-1 in the second set by breaking serve for the first time, helped by two double-faults by Azarenka.

Safina is seeking her first Grand Slam title and plays Maria Sharapova or Dominika Cibulkova next.

Safina was the runner-up at the 2008 French Open and 2009 Australian Open.
