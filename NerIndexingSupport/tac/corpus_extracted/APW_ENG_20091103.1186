The International Softball Federation is seeking a new site for the world championships next year.

ISF president Don Porter announced on Tuesday that the worlds scheduled for next July in Oklahoma City would be moved to a different date and country due to a conflict with an international tournament in Puerto Rico.

Jakarta, Indonesia, was the only other site to submit a bid for the worlds, which were awarded to Oklahoma City in October.
