 
 
Remember When MEN Played Football?
 
 
The Metrodome ceiling collapsed. OMG! What SHALL we do?

Try acting like you live in Green Bay, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Buffalo, et al and take your asses down the road and play in the Golden Gophers OUTDOOR stadium?

But... but... it's cold and snowy.....  

Wah. Take your pussy little asses to Detroit and play in their comfy stadium then.

 
 
 
And if you're losing trip your opponent
 
 
I remember when they played in hard cllimates. They played for less money and loved the game...for the game
 
 
 
And if you're losing trip your opponent

 

I must've missed something.....  
 
 
Excuse Mr. Gunny sir.... you left out Foxboro.

 
 
 
 
And if you're losing trip your opponent

 

And don't forget getting 5th down!  
 
 
It was going to take nearly a week to get TCF stadium prepped.

Mid-life crisis he-man rant: FAIL!

Now, if you want to gripe about dressing NFL players up in pink for a month, you might get me aboard.

I don't see why it would take so long to plow the field.
 
 
i only had potato skins and old newspaper soup to eat, had to walk in blizzards uphill (both ways) 25 km to school. under enemy fire. with lasers. and sharks. mounted on bears. and nazis!

One, they are used to it. Two, if they built a bigger domed stadium with more seats, they would have even more fans than just the ones freezing their asses off.

And the plumbing: all the pipes have been flushed out and are filled with anti-freeze. Wiring the building for cameras and national broadcasting again. Getting all the electrical and heating infrastructure running again.

And it's probably more complicated than plowing snow off the field; that ground is like concrete right now having been under a foot of snow for weeks... they'd have to heat it so players' cleats would have a purpose, and so they wouldn't break wrists when being tackled to the ground.

That place was like a mausoleum. No point in spending all that money powering and heating it when it wasn't going to be used for half a year. I think the week estimate was on the high side, but they definitely didn't have enough time for this week's game.

It would be cool if the Vikings had their fiftieth anniversary celebration next week there.

1967 NFL Championship. The ICe Bowl!!!!

Back in the day when players played hurt and the QB was not pampered. The pit was a place not to be entered by the faint of heart and it was not unusal to see players with blood on the uniforms. The weather? What weather.

Right...And the players went back to bartending and banging nails in February...And the thought of year-round conditioning was laughable...And before teevee revenue sharing made millionaires out of third-string QBs...
 
 
My grandpa went to a couple games at the Metropolitan Stadium... back in the day with Tarkenton.

There's our international airport out by there now, so planes would fly about a hundred feet over the stadium if it was still there.  

I think the old stadium grounds are a parking lot and part of the Mall of America. They should just blow up the Metrodome.

You blaming that traitor Red McCombs? The same red McCombs that has owned half the car dealerships here since the 60's at least?

You best find someone else to argue with, young 'un. Not only is he a liar -- promising us he'd bring the Vikes here -- he made his fortune ripping people off on cars/trucks HERE.

I hope he wins about as much as I hope the Titans do.

Some forwards wear those thin shoulder pads and scrum caps, and it's possible they might be a requirement in the next fifty years. But I'm telling you, football players are not wimps. Rugby is a contact sport; football is a collision sport. The tackling isn't the same.
 
 
A modern day mid tier college football team would wipe the shit out of a 60s NFL team. Calling them wimps is ridiculous.

And you can guarantee that building domes to play sports in is about being able to sell seats, not about what the players want.

Actually, the days of Bud Grant and players shivering on the sidelines in sub zero temperatures are long gone

With modern clothing technology (Under Armor), neoprene gloves and the activity of running around on the field...the players are not suffering like they used to
 
 
I know there were some other posts in this thread and I'm sure they were really interesting... and maybe funny... but someone mentioned beer and I lost all ability to focus on anything other than that.
