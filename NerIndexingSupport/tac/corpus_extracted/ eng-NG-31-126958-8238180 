I know that obits of the rich and famous are done
years in advance. Presumably some of the authors
of these obits die BEFORE their famous subject
does. Has there been a case where an obit was
erroneously published (famous person was not dead)
by an obit author who WAS dead at the time of
publication? A dead man writing the "obit" of a live man!
Nice.

Are there any obit authors so famous enough that co-
authors at the same publisher keep a pre-obit on THEM?

Finally, do famous newspaper publishers/editors
edit their own pre-written obit? Or write it themselves
having a survivor fill in only the cause of death. Do they
"ghost-write" their own obits so to speak?
