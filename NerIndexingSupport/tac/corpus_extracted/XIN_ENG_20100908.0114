Mumbai Anti-Terrorism Squad ( ATS) arrested two persons from Marathawada region
of Maharashtra, western India, in connection with Pune's German Bakery blast in
February, said police on Wednesday.

One of the accused was arrested from Aurangabad and has been identified as
Himayat Baig. Baig is reportedly also wanted in a case related to the Students
Islamic Movement of India (SIMI).

The other person was arrested from Nasik and has been identified as Bilal.
Police also claim to have recovered some explosives from the duo.

ATS chief Rakesh Maria said that Baig was arrested in Pune and had been involved
in two other cases.

"The first arrest was made from Mahatma Gandhi bus stand in Pune. The person is
involved in two previous cases. The case took us to Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh,
Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, Gujarat, Daman and New Delhim," Maria told reporters
here.

"The second arrest was made from Nasik. Two kilograms of RDX seized from the two
accused along with wires, manuals for making bomb, pen drives, study material
and the U.S. and Indian currency," Maria added.

He also said that the two accused had been working for Pakistan- based terror
group Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT).

"They have carried out recce of some sights for LeT. Himayat Baig is very
important and is the LeT chief of Maharashtra, who brought Aurangabad module and
Indian Mujahedeen module together."

"The conspiracy was hatched in January at Udgir in Latur district. Himayat Baig
used to run Global Internet Cafe in Udgir where explosives were brought, bombs
made and some targets were decided. German Bakery was one of them," Maria added.

The ATS chief also claimed that two more people were involved in planning the
blast.

"On January 31, Himayat conducted a recce of German Bakery and was also involved
in planting the bomb with Mohmmad Ahmed Zarar Siddibappa alias Yasin. On
February 3, there was a meeting between Mohsin Choudhry, Yasin and Himayat at
Udgir. On February 7, Mohsin got explosives at the internet cafe where the bomb
was made," the ATS chief said.

"Mohsin and Yasin are wanted in the case. They were being controlled by somebody
in LeT. A pen drive has been seized and some photographs have also been found,"
he added.

Baig and Bilal reportedly provided only the logistical support for the February
13 blast in which at least 16 people were killed and 65 others injured.

Among those killed were an Italian, an Iranian and two Sudanese.
