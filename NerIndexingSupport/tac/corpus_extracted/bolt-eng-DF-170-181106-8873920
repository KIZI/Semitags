They really are going in the crapper fast! I used to watch Anderson Cooper pretty regularly and felt he was some what fair...not any more...he is just another in a long line of "tingly feelers". Make me ill.

Introduce him, get his comment, go to another on site, do the same. Why could she possibly think that i would care what she thought about this? Amazing. Is this what our jounalism has sunk to?

Bad jounalism is bad journalism. I studied this stuff in school and was amazed at the time that our jounalists had risen from a long line of biased, party line promoting rags. Sometime in the early days of reporting as we know it, Ethics took hold and we gained an appreciation for unbiased reporting.

Opinion pieces are different. When Charles Krauthammer puts a piece together, you get to see his rationale and deduction, but you can be assured that the conclusion will be more conservative than less. That's opinion, though, and there is a place for that.

When a reporter starts arguing with the person she selects to give a comment, she shows contempt for the person, ignorance of her trade, impudence of highest order and no respect for the intelligence of her audience. In this particular case, she also showed outright laziness in not having a counterpoint ready to go in a second interview and not having done her homework on the range of issues at point.

This little girl was playing in a grown up world and making an utter ass of herself. That CNN would put her on is an insult to CNN. If CNN does not know that this is unproffesional, they are idiots. If they know and put her on anyway, they are hacks. Either way, it's an embarrasment to anyone who respects the craft of journalism.

Actually it's pretty typical of CNN to impart their own bias into supposed journalism. They usually just aren't that blatant about it.
 
 
I have mixed feelings about this, when does the time come when stupid is called stupid. What the man was saying was like he was a recording of simpleminded slogans. He is allowed those slogans but others can counter. Where was he these past eight plus years? And they both argued, no where is it written that an interviewer in a public forum has to listen to loud BS without comment.

Much like Fox trying to make a great success out of an event that could not draw a fraction of the attendance of a gay pride parade in a right wing city like Houston.
 
 
You got 200k people to show up for what is essentially a big party that has nothing whatever to do with politics and you think this is a fair comparison exactly how?
 
 
Nothing to do with politics?

You dont know what a gay pride parade is then.
 
 
Oh for peat sake you've got a dozen political activist making speeches that 90% of the crowd couldn't repeat the next day and everyone else is partying down.
 
 
In case it has escaped observation, the general discontent that drove the Tea Parties and will probably continue to drive this movement, is a general discontent with government altogether. Political affiliation had nothing to do with it. I was directly involved in the Chicago event. Fox had nothing to do with it.
 
 
Gay pride is decades old the the entire reason it was invented is to show the community the numbers of people who amke up the gay community.

It all started with dressup so the people could diguise their identities to keep from being attacked or fired after the event.

YOu really dont understand that gay people still get killed in some communities?

Are you claiming that the folks at a tea party killed gays? Sort of like you claimed they killed two policemen? Sort of like you tried to blame the right for killing police because of a deranged individual? Specifically your kind of 'truth.'

I don't mean to imply that because a person becomes a journalist, that person forfeits the right to free speech. That right is guarenteed. The same is true of people who take up employment as train conducters, policemen or doctors.

In this particular case, though, this amateur injected her own political views where they had no right to be. A reporter is to report. If she wanted to present another view, she could have sought out various views. Lord knows there were plenty. "Sir, why did you come here today? Ma'am, why are YOU here today? Young man, you are only 5. Why are you here today?" That would have been a good series of questions and, by their answers, the people would have revealed themselves for better or worse.

By injecting her own passions into the mix, all that was revealed was a small minded, lazy, unproffessional wannabe who had no expertise in the execution of this very important proffession. This would be acceptable on the local college TV station, but not on CNN. When someone is on CNN, they are supposed to be a little more proffessional and the editors should be a little more also.

This was a sad day for journalism.
 
 
That journalist was harrassed by the crowd wehn she arrived for merely having CNN on her mike when she walked in.
 
 
You know....I used to watch CNN and all their shows for quite a while. However, when they started to get elitist, that's when I left them, and now watch several news channels to try to see where everyone is talking about the same thing.

Once you find the similarities, it's easier to separate the differences, thus helping you find your way to the truth.

However.......CNN's Susan Rosegen isn't the only one to do this.......remember Bill O'Reilly and Geraldo Rivera's attack journalism interviews?

Geraldo did it to Scumdog Million Hair Blow Job Bitch (Blagojavich).

O'Reilly sent in a team to attack interview a lady who called him on the carpet after he'd spoken at a rape victims gathering, after he'd said that some people were actually looking to be raped by the way they dress.

Nobody is innocent. They all do it.

The video would not play. The role of a commentator is to comment. I have a high regard for Krauthammer's line of logic. I don't know what Obama said in his speech to which Krauthammer refers or what Krauthammer said. Could you capsulize?
 
 
Midcan, I believe we all expect editorial writers to be biased. I have a pretty good idea what Krugman's take on a topic will be, when he surprises me, I say so.

Yeah, that's it, that's the story and you are sticking to it. That made her all of the sudden obviously biased in her false journalistic approach.

Fox news is 37% owned by the Saudis.

Gay pride events are out of control, they have turned into public displays of indecency. Open sexual acts and nudity. If the gay community does not act responsibly and legally when given the permission to parade than what can we expect if we change customs and traditions to appease the gay community.

I can post links making the point but I think its better if you do a search on something like "gay pride events turn into public orgy".

It may not be all gay people at these parades but much of what happens is illegal in every city and every state, the police turn a blind eye to these crimes.

Who "they all" are is the point in question, though. A reporter is to report the important facts and gain as much information for the viewer as possible. A commentator is to present the side of the story that he feels will attract a larger audience. Big difference.

There is a place for both in news media. When a commentator presents work as reporting, that amounts to lying. Opinion is opinion and facts are facts.

The people that you cite are usually commentators.

 The numbers are in... (Wizbang) 

 
The numbers are in...
Posted by Michael Laprarie
Published: April 17, 2009 - 7:54 AM

Several groups have now compiled total attendance numbers for the April 15th Tea Party. SurgeUSA.org estimates between 400,000 and 480,000 total attendance. RedState has compiled a total of 310,000 from 156 parties. The latest roundup from PajamasMedia puts the number at 551,000. And Chuck Simmins at North Shore Journal has compiled the various other compilations and put them all together in a nice chart.

I think the best way to keep this in perspective is to realize that just a few weeks ago, Organizing For America, the Obama Campaign's professional pitchfork brigade, worked over their list of 13 million registered Obama supporters and came up with a measly 114,000 signatures (less than 1%) in support of the Obama Administration's stimulus plan. And after an additional nationwide neighborhood canvassing effort by trained volunteers, only 100,000 additional signatures were collected.

Naturally liberals are branding the turnout of half a million Tea Party supporters on Wednesday as a "failure." But so far, the nascent Tea Party movement has either matched or exceeded the turnouts reported for the first liberal "meet-ups" that were the precursors to the Netroots phenomenon of 2004 - 2008.

Of course those meetings garnered massive nationwide press coverage by a news media desperate to report anything that might damage the Bush Administration. The April 16 New York Times, by contrast, failed to publish a single word about the Tea Parties.

For all of its alleged "failure" this week, Fox News ratings soared during its Tea Party coverage, while over on the other side, the New York Times just announced that it will eliminate several weekly sections of its newspaper in order to cut millions of dollars in operating costs. No further comment should be necessary.

__________________________________

One more noteworthy item: this interesting little discussion from Instapundit about "what's next" after the Tea Parties. Some great suggestions - hundreds or thousands of Tea Partiers start showing up at local political "meet and greet" or town hall events; regular protests outside of local ACORN offices alleging voter fraud; a sit-in at CNN headquarters in Atlanta. Looks like fun, plus I think Alinsky would be proud. The last time I checked, there was nothing in Rules for Radicals that said "liberals only."

 

BTW, quick google search shows TM didn't come up with the Houston story on her own. No surprise, as she's a tool. Funny thing, the rest of the spinners are also taking heat. LOL!
 
 
I don't trust any of the controlled media but i bet the fox team could kick the CNN teams ass in a fist fight....just sayin...

Good luck with that. Cooper and King would mop the floor with Beck and O'Reilly.

My party is the United States of America, maybe you have not been paying attention but I do not blindly post simply based on my feelings. I am glad you gave me the oppurtunity to point that out, noob.

I make mistakes, correct them when realized, apologize if I need to, I know the flaws of our political system. To me its more important to point out the corruption and policy of both parties.
 
 
 
This is some of the worst "journalism" I have ever seen.

I did laugh when a guy in the crowd yelled "Shut up!" to the reporter.

 

I took that to mean, "Shut up!" and let the man answer. She was supposed to be a reporter and not there to argue with the the man after she asked his reason for being there.

As a reporter she was unprofessional. It would've been fair to explore other people's views who were there at the same time, though.

And they both argued, no where is it written that an interviewer in a public forum has to listen to loud BS without comment.

 

what part of bad journalism don't you get?

reporters report, if they were supposed to interact, they'd call them interactors.

 

Interactors or the talking heads we see on T.V. that are suppose to make political comments--(that's what they're paid for). A reporter is a reporter. They are "supposed" to show no bias what-so-ever--& only ask the questions.

But let's face, the left wing media in the country meaning ABC, CBS, NBC & MSN PMS-- & all those "tingly feelings", have been very instrumental in getting Barack Obama elected. The positive comments about him during their reporting as to McCain were so out-weighted it was laughable.

NOTICE--how we hear no more bad news on Iraq from Charlie Gibson. In fact the last report he did on Iraq--made Bagdad look more like a vacation resort. When Bush was in office just 2-1/2 short months ago--all we heard about was the BAD NEWS coming out of Iraq.

These media stations are totally in the box--they have no way out--so the next solution is to hammer away at the Americans who are opposed to our wreckless--out-of-control big spending government. Why? Because the man they played a major role in getting elected is sitting in the oval office. It's nothing more than that--& it is to be expected in today's left wing journalism.

Journalist, Heal Thyself [Kevin D. Williamson]
From the Philadelphia Inquirer's March 19 editorial:
... corporate executives who run their companies into the ground should pay dearly for their greed, ineptness and incompetence. From the Philadelphia Inquirer's creditors, in bankruptcy proceedings:
Since the debtors acquisition in June 2006, the debtors have not produced a financial forecast that it has attained, much less exceeded.Specifically, despite revising its business plan twice during 2008, the debtors were not able to closely project 2008 annual results. Indeed, the forecasts produced in late December 2007 and March 2008 were so badly missed that they exceeded a negative variance of 40 percent. After the 2008 forecast completions were missed, the EBITDA for the immediate months following were also missed, demonstrating that management was incapable of projecting their businesses in the very short term. I don't know about greed, but I do think the Inquirer should pay for its ineptness, and should pay dearly indeed for incubating the career of that Marley & Me guy.

 Media Bias Is Real, Finds UCLA Political Scientist / UCLA Newsroom 

 
Media Bias Is Real, Finds UCLA Political Scientist
By Meg Sullivan | 12/14/2005 5:36:31 PM
While the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal is conservative, the newspaper's news pages are liberal, even more liberal than The New York Times. The Drudge Report may have a right-wing reputation, but it leans left. Coverage by public television and radio is conservative compared to the rest of the mainstream media. Meanwhile, almost all major media outlets tilt to the left.

These are just a few of the surprising findings from a UCLA-led study, which is believed to be the first successful attempt at objectively quantifying bias in a range of media outlets and ranking them accordingly....

...

Of the 20 major media outlets studied, 18 scored left of center, with CBS' "Evening News," The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times ranking second, third and fourth most liberal behind the news pages of The Wall Street Journal.

Only Fox News' "Special Report With Brit Hume" and The Washington Times scored right of the average U.S. voter.

The most centrist outlet proved to be the "NewsHour With Jim Lehrer." CNN's "NewsNight With Aaron Brown" and ABC's "Good Morning America" were a close second and third.

"Our estimates for these outlets, we feel, give particular credibility to our efforts, as three of the four moderators for the 2004 presidential and vice-presidential debates came from these three news outlets  Jim Lehrer, Charlie Gibson and Gwen Ifill," Groseclose said. "If these newscasters weren't centrist, staffers for one of the campaign teams would have objected and insisted on other moderators."

The fourth most centrist outlet was "Special Report With Brit Hume" on Fox News, which often is cited by liberals as an egregious example of a right-wing outlet. While this news program proved to be right of center, the study found ABC's "World News Tonight" and NBC's "Nightly News" to be left of center. All three outlets were approximately equidistant from the center, the report found.

"If viewers spent an equal amount of time watching Fox's 'Special Report' as ABC's 'World News' and NBC's 'Nightly News,' then they would receive a nearly perfectly balanced version of the news," said Milyo, an associate professor of economics and public affairs at the University of Missouri at Columbia.

Five news outlets  "NewsHour With Jim Lehrer," ABC's "Good Morning America," CNN's "NewsNight With Aaron Brown," Fox News' "Special Report With Brit Hume" and the Drudge Report  were in a statistical dead heat in the race for the most centrist news outlet. Of the print media, USA Today was the most centrist.....

I don't trust any of the controlled media but i bet the fox team could kick the CNN teams ass in a fist fight....just sayin...

 

Are you saying that Beck or O'Reilly could beat up Cooper and John King?

Good luck with that. Cooper and King would mop the floor with Beck and O'Reilly.

FAUX noise has a lot of old people who are fat and lazy. Only thing they've got is big mouths and no shame.

Kinda like to see a Celebrity Deatchmatch on MTV between those 4 though........

 

fox would dirty fight...throw sand in their eyes...groin kicks..I just think the killer instinct
and cunning of fox would be the advantage...

 

I might believe that were it not for the fact that O'Reilly and Beck are too fucking scared to go out on assignment.

Cooper and John King do it regularly, and not nice places either........both covered Katrina and Iraq in person.

Nope.......still gonna go with Cooper and King on this one.
 
 
Cooper is a homosexual.

Not that there is anything wrong with that, but something to consider if you wish to discuss the abilty to throw down...

As well as listening to Rush Limbaugh I am informed, any topic I choose to post in you can do nothing more than flame me and attempt to discredit me by applying labels.

I am at a bit of a disadvantage, I am traveling for work so I do not have my vast library at my disposal. So go ahead, show everyone on the boards how you can best krotchdog, take any of my posts and debate.

Isn't O'Reilly like 6'-7" or something? Beck looks like a wrestler. It might be fun to watch. Celebrity tag team wrestling. The real fight in wrestling always happens as the performers say what they will do to their opponents, so this may not be a real stretch for the wrestling genre.

no matter how much the left wing haters hate fox the truth remains constant. Fox has more viewers than CNN MSNBC combined and that's on the re-runs..  

 

They also probably have a more diverse audience. I used to watch both CNN and MSNBC,but can't tolerate them any longer. They were especially bad during the primaries and got worse during the general. The hatred they spewed toward Hillary,Palin and McCain did them in for me,they don't even try to be objective any longer.
 
 
the media thought people protesting the bush govt were patriots, the obama media despises people protesting the obama govt. this cnn reporter is no different from 90% of reporters. all part of the dem party.

Listen to Obama at minute mark 57.26, what a joke, what an embrassement.

You know.......saying there is only one place to get news is kinda misleading.

Also leads to single minded partisan hacks.

You don't believe God likes variety? Imagine what life would be like if there was only 1 floor plan for a house, everyone drove either a car or a truck, and everyone's family looked the same.

You're an idiot dude.
 
 
The problem is people actually think objective means showing both falsehood and truth.

Fox News is not objective, nor is CNN, or MSNBC.

But that's the devil's question, "is murder right or is adultery right?" The answer is not a debate between Murder and Adultery but that both are WRONG.

Which news agency has the right world view?

Fox News is right.

CNN and MSNBC are wrong.

Reporting the News cannot be done without a worldview exhibited, so you have to choose the correct one.

I watch a variety of news and listen to a variety of news sources. I rarely read newpapers anymore. No conscious plan there, just don't subscribe to the local paper. I will listen to Rush every now and then. I lean toward NPR a little more than him. I think I might have have watched Hannity once, but that was enough. He seems angry all the time.

Two shows that are interesting to me for comparisson purposes are Reliable Sources on CNN and Newswatch on FOX. Same basic premise and both are weekly. It's fun to see the nuance differences.

Yesterday, Newswatch opened with about 5 minutes on the CNN Reporter who yearns to be an commentator. Reliable Sources airs this morning at 10:00 am Eastern. I'll be interested to see how this is treated.

The actual news is just a part of the message. How it is packaged is probably a bigger part. This is why some salesmen are rich and some are looking for work.

Paul Harvey was viewed by some as a news man, by some as a humorist, by some as a social commetator and by just about everyone as a unique and honoable person. He viewed himself as a salesman. His stories were there simply to sell the radio or pill that was paying his salary that day or week.

I miss his common sense, long pause for emphasis delivery of ideas and events.

This is some of the worst "journalism" I have ever seen.

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv2jU4HexYo 

I did laugh when a guy in the crowd yelled "Shut up!" to the reporter.

 

Why is it with you people and "the worst"? Do you wake up every morning as from a coma? Every time someone sets you straight you act like its the first time you have been corrected.

This was not an attack. You tea baggers are idiots and major whiners.
 
 
You know...just heard on Reliable Sources an interview Mr. Kurtz did with another journalist, and I realized something from what he said.......

Over the past 10-15 years, politics has evolved to an "us versus them" mentality. Either you're full conservative, or you're full liberal, there is no middle ground.

But, if you think about it, it's not so much that one side is right and one side is wrong, it is that the issues have become so intertwined, that being a "pure conservative" or a "pure liberal" is no longer applicable.

I know conservatives who hold liberal ideals, as well as liberals who hold conservative ideals. I'm one of the latter.

Instead of saying "you're wrong because your view is different", why not ask where each person has similarities with the others, so that they've got common ground.

THEN work out the differences.

people like her diminish the message because she looks like an idiot...

as do you.

neither of you helps make MY side of the argument in any intelligent or convincing way.
 
 
Yep comprimise your principles, with a statist there is no comprimise, a conservative gives an inch and they will take a mile, Bush comprimised and look how they treat him, as weak, as a liar. Bush worked on an education bill with Kennedy, what did it get him nothing.

When the side that is right comprimises to meet those who are wrong, both sides are wrong, period. Conservative principles state my private property is mine, so I will meet halfway, give half to the government? That is insanity, what about homosexuality being taught to children, let meet halfway on that, whoops, thats something we cannot meet halfway on, I cannot teach me children that homosexuality is wrong, I must meet halfway which is to throw that moral right out the window. Lets see what else I can meet halfway on, christianinty, nope, no halfway point on that either. I wil think of more.

Halfway to hell is exactly that, you are halfway there.

Anti-war is typically a left position. I didn't see the word "extremist" that your "honest" media so loosely throws around, along with "racist" and a few others.

I haven't seen any war protests since Bush left office, where's Cindy Sheehan been ? Oh that's right, doing the same thing, but Bush isn't president anymore so the left has thrown her out like yesterday's garbage......

actually, being anti-war USED to be considered a "left" position because pacificm was synonomous with the left. However, now, b/c of WHERE the war is, you have all the rightwing, "the Zog is running the world" conspiracy nutcases who oppose the war just on the principal that they think it might benefit israel (even though it destabilized the entire region and empowered Iran... which was dangerous to Israel).

i always thought cindy sheehan was a jerk.

so i'm not sure of your definition of "left".

Anti-war is typically a left position.

 

And anti-tax is typically a right position. So why didn't FuaxNews put up "Rightists" when those people held the tea parties?

Btw - The Maoists and the Russian Communists destroying everything in their sight... yeah, they're just good old fashioned conservatives aren't they? And Stalin, he was very right-wing, huh?  

 
I didn't see the word "extremist" that your "honest" media so loosely throws around, along with "racist" and a few others.

 

That's because neither anti-war nor anti-tax protests are extremist or racist.

 
I haven't seen any war protests since Bush left office, where's Cindy Sheehan been?

 

Are you paying attention to the news? What were all the protests at the G20 about? Too much hairspray? Not enough fast food restaurants?

And Cindy Sheehan is a flaming moron.

When it's anti-war protests, it's "leftist." But when it's anti-tax protests, they're all great americans. WOW. How un-biased of Fox!

 

I listened to the story you inserted. Apparently, this was the "Recreate '68" demonstation at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. The people in this demonstration were left of the Democratic Party platform. Is it not accurate to call them Leftist?

The people in the march refused to talk to the reporter who was asking questions. The crowd chanted an obsenity. This looked and sounded very different than the CNN Reporter piece.

Is it your view that these were two identical, if mirror image, pieces?

Fox poll? Self serving?

Here are some numbers for you to ponder. Compare the numbers that turned out to see Obama in his campaigne to the stupid tea party turnout. At least a hundred to one without the benefit of a major television corporation organising it. That was a true grass roots movement. Your astro turf turnout was embarrssing for you.

Oh PLease! Even with your overestimation that is less than.o1% of the population(for you numerically challanged.01% is one in ten thousand) after a month and a half of constant egging on by neo-con television personalities. Just admit it was a big fat belly flop of a dismal failure.
 
 
Failure? Hardly. That talking point isn't working, even with MSM any longer:

 Tea Party protests - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 

311,000. I know you're trying to be condescending, but I won't sink to that level. 130 men participated in the original tea party, a much less number per capita than this week's parties, and look what they inspired then!

If you don't see that as pure fascism them you have no clue as to the actual meaning of a word that gets thrown around pretty loosly.

Yeah maybe by minimizing the protests people will forget about a 2 trillion dollar budget deficit that will have to be paid for either by the demise of this country or extremely high tax rates for all.

What are the names of the companies that did not bid.

How do you feel about Oxy Chemical, you know Al Gores company, remember when Clinton released the strategic oil reserves to Al's company, that sucked to, no bid, nothing.

Anyhow I am just curious, what were the names of those other companies.

Yo, Crotch Smoker.....ya wanna talk about Halliburton's no bid contracts (given to them by Bush Jr.), which resulted in the death of SEVERAL military personnel, as well as the shoddy work that was done to Walter Reed.

I'll wait.........

By the way douche......if you're gonna keep PM'ing me with your problems, you're gonna have to pay me for it.

Are you saying that Beck or O'Reilly could beat up Cooper and John King?

Good luck with that. Cooper and King would mop the floor with Beck and O'Reilly.

FAUX noise has a lot of old people who are fat and lazy. Only thing they've got is big mouths and no shame.

Kinda like to see a Celebrity Deatchmatch on MTV between those 4 though........

 

fox would dirty fight...throw sand in their eyes...groin kicks..I just think the killer instinct
and cunning of fox would be the advantage...

 

I might believe that were it not for the fact that O'Reilly and Beck are too fucking scared to go out on assignment.

Cooper and John King do it regularly, and not nice places either........both covered Katrina and Iraq in person.

Nope.......still gonna go with Cooper and King on this one.

 

You do understand that King and Cooper are supposed to be news anchors; O'Reilley and Beck are only commentators. I guess the confusion comes from the fact that King and Cooper sound so much like commentators because they do give opinions, and some of us prefer to think of O'Reilley and Beck as News anchors to make the comparison viable.

But O'Reilley and Beck are only representing themselves as commentators, and not news anchors. To comment is to give an opinion. To be a news anchor means to provide unbiased reporting of the news.

It's a sad thing that somehow we have lost the distinction between reporting news pieces and giving opinion pieces.

Did you really watch your video?
The FOX reporter did not criticize their message, he only asked if the wanted to articulate it for the mike. When they got rough with him and his presence he asked them if they did or did not believe in freedom. I presume he meant freedom of the press. It was an attempt to report.

Susan Roesegen did criticize the message, after asking a participant to explain the message she cut him off and gave her own version. This was not an attempt to report ; it was an attempt to slander.
 
 
 
 
 
At least 300,000 is not embarrassing at all. The founders of our country were initially small and number and mocked by the King and his supporters the same way you are mocking the modern day tea parties.

Much fewer come out than share the sentiments. Much less than 1% who have strong feelings about an issue are willing to go to the streets and protest about it. If there were were 100 people standing behind the sentiments of 311,000 protestors, that would be at least 31-million, which is fewer than the polls show. If the issue can be kept alive, in spite of all the criticism coming from the Kool-Aid drinkers, July 4th will be much larger, and we have next near to grow it right into the congressional elections. The House members are paying attention. Watch for defections from both House and Senate members who feel threatened.

What a horrible message Susan had, too. Liberty exists despite government, not because of it. The more the government spends, the less free you are. Do you people actually feel freer after Bush's huge deficits and the Iraq war? Why will the opposite result come from the same policies followed by Obama?

She got her own website devoted to her:

Real Americans don't worry about who's holiday is more important to them and just live their lives.

Real Americans don't whine about protests they disagree with but instead listen, participate, or ignore based on how it matches their needs or desires.

Real Americans don't attack someone for their lifestyle of religious choices no matter what they are, only should those pose a real and serious threat to their own country.

Sorry, but too many use the term "Real American" without even knowing what one is.

The question is, do they know why they are shooting off fireworks?

I guarantee you if someone was to take a poll on what the Fourth of July is, a shocking number of Americans could not tell you what the celebration really is all about.

Those people who not only understand Independence Day, but cherish it for what it symbolizes are those who are Real Americans.

The little kids run around wild with the sparklers. Then ya all settle in for the big show put on by the chamber of commerse. The whole shebang ends up in a huge never ending display with the Star Spangled Banner being played in the background. With the words "the rockets red glare" everybody gets it and they all smile upon one another and are glad to the bone they are Americans.

 

Anyone can shoot off fireworks and grill hamburgers.

The question is, do they know why they are shooting off fireworks?

I guarantee you if someone was to take a poll on what the Fourth of July is, a shocking number of Americans could not tell you what the celebration really is all about.

Those people who not only understand Independence Day, but cherish it for what it symbolizes are those who are Real Americans.

 

I think Huggy believes that "Leave it to Beaver" is what American life was suppose to be like... just sayin...

Gay pride is decades old the the entire reason it was invented is to show the community the numbers of people who amke up the gay community.

It all started with dressup so the people could diguise their identities to keep from being attacked or fired after the event.

YOu really dont understand that gay people still get killed in some communities?

 

You really don't understand that gay people kill people in some communities?

WTF does that have to do with anything? Are Gay Pride parades meant to show us how queens in drag (the ones wearing clothes) are really "just like us" and family friendly?

Give me a fucking break.
 
 
Real Americans, the forth of July, Christmas, carbon foot print. If you are a citizen you are a real american, if you are recent immigrant with a green card you are a real american.

Forth of July or Christmas, you cannot have one without the other, without religion the USA would not be here, the writing and education of the founders provide ample of evidence.

Carbon footprint, everything on earth is carbon, without carbon dioxide in the atmosphere all life dies, thank God liberal Statists know the exact amount that is good for us and they know how to get us there because as you can see the democrats did a fine job at the helm of the Financial Services Committee and the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs.

Guess that's true, without religion the US founders wouldn't have wanted to pull away from the Church of England...
 
 
 
You got 200k people to show up for what is essentially a big party that has nothing whatever to do with politics and you think this is a fair comparison exactly how?

 

If you think those rallys had nothing to do with politics you have not been paying attention. If you are happy just blindly letting the government take over this country and answering yes to every thing they do, I understand your comment. They work for us, and when the taxes become confiscatory, the power mad politicians gain more power and pass more bad legislation (Chris Dodd and Barney Frank), this country is in real trouble.

To be blinded by partisan politics is to be blinded by the real problems. They want us to argue over party lines that way we are less involved in their actual day to day corruption.
 
 
 
 
 
 Tea Party protests - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 

311,000. I know you're trying to be condescending, but I won't sink to that level. 130 men participated in the original tea party, a much less number per capita than this week's parties, and look what they inspired then!

 

Much fewer come out than share the sentiments. Much less than 1% who have strong feelings about an issue are willing to go to the streets and protest about it. If there were were 100 people standing behind the sentiments of 311,000 protestors, that would be at least 31-million, which is fewer than the polls show. If the issue can be kept alive, in spite of all the criticism coming from the Kool-Aid drinkers, July 4th will be much larger, and we have next near to grow it right into the congressional elections. The House members are paying attention. Watch for defections from both House and Senate members who feel threatened.

 

Agreed.

 

AGREED-- July 4th is going to be HUGE. Even at mine--on April 15th--we had hundreds of cars driving by honking horns, thumbs up, etc.

They're going to show up on the 4th of July. Most Americans are off that day.

DITTO--both sides of the isle love those that are ignorant as to what they're elected representatives are doing. They love to keep us fighting with one-another--democrats vs. republicans. They do anything they can to keep the focus off of them. That's why this country is in the mess it is today. No one has been watching them, (our elected representatives.)

It's high time we as Americans, democrats, republicans & independents fight with our politicians rather than each other.

Actually, a July 4th may seem like a good idea, but with so few holidays to spend time with family I doubt as many will show. I understand the connection completely but on a day with less tradition might be better. Perhaps a presidents birthday or some other federal holiday.

No - the symbolic gesture alone makes the 4th the perfect time for such an event.

I hope hundreds of thousands converge upon DC and shake the foundations of that swamp ridden political sideshow to its core.

Ok - I'm dreamin' a bit - but this is America, the government isn't taxing dreams yet are they? Then again...

Shhh... don't give them anymore ideas....

*hides all dreams*

The significance is great, as I said I understand it, but you would also have to hope that enough Americans would break their family traditions on the holiday to show. Doing it on a less tradition filled holiday might make a better choice because then you wouldn't have to break old and meaningful traditions to make the same impact. If I knew where my father was still, July 4th would be a time I would spend with him. He is the one that made me understand the American dream, the spirit of hard work and know how our country stood for, the spirit of freedom and willingness to fight for it, and if I knew where he was I know I would keep the tradition of watching the fireworks and BBQ with him, nothing would take me from that. Now i have a personal tradition of spending it with my best friend (the only family I have now), and I won't even stop that tradition though it's small and new. Most people have some family tradition, usually revolving around fireworks and BBQ, it's a reminder of the US spirit.

No way this could totally work...here's what it would be.

"Camp-out on the Mall".

Every patriotic 4th of July lover trucks over to Washington D.C. and camps out (permitted of course) on the Washington Mall, where the Inauguration was...and throws barbecues, and basically everyone just shares with everyone else and protests Obama and the Feds and Bush and whatever they want really.

It's about Populism against Politicians.

I bet you could get millions to show up to an event like that...a once in a life time amazing 4th of July.

Cable television news network CNN has attempted to block a video on YouTube.com that shows "tea party" protesters in Chicago confronting the network's reporter Susan Roesgen over her allegedly biased and "not fair" coverage of the event.

Members of Founding Bloggers.com were on hand to videotape the crowd's response to Roesgen's report. The reporter is seen badgering protesters on air and describing the tea party as "anti-government, anti-CNN, since this is highly promoted by the right-wing, conservative network Fox."

Roesgen's report included arguments with the tea partiers, tossing out contrary positions and demanding her subjects justify their positions, as well as an antagonistic interview with a protester whose sign read, "Obama is a fascist."

 

So many in the media continue to demonstrate their liberal bias. Now days it's hard to find an objective reporter. You would think the idiots would understand what they report becomes a permanent record.

How ironic that a news reporting agency would object to a citizen posting a video of the agency's reporter on assignment.
 
 
 
 
 
By real americans I mean the kind where you take the wife and kids to the park..make burgers and roast weenies and marshmellows...then when it gets dark ya set off the cheezy fireworks ya got at the indian reservation. The little kids run around wild with the sparklers. Then ya all settle in for the big show put on by the chamber of commerse. The whole shebang ends up in a huge never ending display with the Star Spangled Banner being played in the background. With the words "the rockets red glare" everybody gets it and they all smile upon one another and are glad to the bone they are Americans.

 

Anyone can shoot off fireworks and grill hamburgers.

The question is, do they know why they are shooting off fireworks?

I guarantee you if someone was to take a poll on what the Fourth of July is, a shocking number of Americans could not tell you what the celebration really is all about.

Those people who not only understand Independence Day, but cherish it for what it symbolizes are those who are Real Americans.

 

I think Huggy believes that "Leave it to Beaver" is what American life was suppose to be like... just sayin...  

 

Throw in a hooker and an eight ball and you are spot on.

If we depended on our MSM to report events like this one, who would know they happened April 29 at Arnold, Missouri.

Hundreds  Protest Obama  at Arnold, Missouri

 Obama's Response inside Fox High School  was the only press coverage it got.; Obama mocking Fox News and the Tea Bag protests in general.

If this had been Bush, his message would've been completely drowned out by the report of ordinary folks protesting. In this situation the exact opposite is the case.
 
 
I swear, that was BAD journalism.

Let say she was biased, does she not need some information to spin the debate to her own view point? Goebbels is rolling in his grave over the CNN propaganda machine!!

I did not catch what the Angry Dad was saying. He got to the Lincoln part of his statement and the Soro-head cut him off and start pushing her talking points.

Cover the news, damn CNN--or else I will start up my own news network channel that eliminates all bias.

Think about it, We film it, you make your own determination. ACNN(American Chaos New network)
 
 
 
 
 
Address the topic please.

 

Agreed, Jillian is trying to say a leftwing bigot should be with FOX, perhaps an inadvertent agreement that FOX is less biased, as proven by university studies?

 

no, as proven by Fox's overwhelming viewship..

 

Is "viewship" a word?
