Hi,

First off I'd like to establish that I'm kind of intelligent, I may not be a candidate for Oxbridge or anything, however I've always been in the top sets, put on the 'Gifted and Talented' register (which I think is pointless, but yeah) and quite academically bright.

However I've never really achieved the grades I've been predicted or want to achieve, not necessarily failing, mainly B's and a few A's, however I never really perform to my expectation or anyone else's expectation as I always have teachers asking me why I never performed as well as I 'should have'

It's something which as always annoyed me, especially as in class I generally 'set the pace' (that was taken from my school report) I'm possibly just venting, but it's really frustrating, I genuinely put in all the effort I can (although never really manage time too well, because of other activities, friends etc.) It's just rather annoying I guess.

I got diagnosed with anxiety from a young age, but I'm not going to allow that to be a excuse for under performing.
 
 
Grades are more about your ability to memorize the mark schemes  
 
 
I'm the opposite I'm not smart but seem to get good grades. I'm a MASTER crammer and my brain is like a sponge, I can memorise 6 full essays before and exam and in exam I usually carefully remember my answers. I got 4 A's last year in my A Levels and I'm going to UCL to study Law this September and I'm ****ting myself for when they find out I'm not actually intelligent just a MEGA crammer

EEKKKKKKK
 
 
A piece of advice, don't make a thread about it. Get off TSR and get the work done!
 
 
Grades aren't just about intelligence, people have to know how to answer the questions and have to actually put the effort in to do reading and stuff as well. You can be the smartest person in the world but if you don't know the **** you're meant to then you're going to get crap grades.
 
 
There's so many variables it's impossible to actually answer that. Grades can be achieved by robotically looking at material until it's remembered - note: not learned. There's a big difference between understanding something and remembering it. Unfortunately, grades are all about remembering.

Then there are obviously people that understand certain things and perform well and can get top grades in them.
 
 
Grades = intelligence on paper.
 
 
I negged you for wasting my time.
 
 
I've always got better grades than others who are as intelligent if not more so than me because of a lack of exam nerves and an ability to answer the question. I reckon good exam technique can add a grade or two.

Said the guy with near 6 thousand posts?
I'm hardly ever on here when I'm working, to be honest, the only reason I've been on lately is because I'm trying not to over do it, and grounded...
 
 
Yes and no. You're more like to find intelligent folks near the top grades of the spectrum, but just because you may have had low grades it does not mean you're not as smart as them.
 
 
I knew someone who got really high grades, but thought Iraq and Afghanistan were the same place.
 
 
Probably a correlation but I don't really know what intelligence means, or what you're referring to. Though I hate the clowns on here who strive to subtley show off about how intelligent they are because they "don't do much work but still get top marks   "
 
 
Intelligence has many factors.

Knowledge is but one of them.

Grades are how hard you work, and how well you can write down what you know, not necessarily how intelligent you are.
 
 
Nah I wouldn't say so. And another thing is, intelligence does not equal success.

However, A's are good grades, nothing to complain about there. You said you have time management problems, maybe that's what you might want to work on? You'll be surprised how much an extra 10 minutes of studying a day can do to your grades. Just go over the days notes or lessons and bam, better grades like that.

But you also sound like a busy person and that's good. I wouldn't give up extracurricular activities just to get better grades as I personally find it is harder to pick up extracurricular activities than to get better grades.

Btw, your teachers sound like pricks.

A-Levels are only a partial measure of intelligence.

A-Levels measure : intelligence, dedication to work, ability to manage a workload, motivation, memory, etc

If A-Levels were a measure of intelligence, and a measure of intelligence only, then they would be tests of pure raw intelligence.

Anyone can get an A with the right amount of work. Universities aren't necessarily looking for the most talented candidates, as A-Levels don't sort the most talented candidates from the rest. A-Levels sort those who can deal with the workload, nothing more.

If you can get an A, it might mean you're very intelligent. It may also mean that you can work hard, with dedication and learn the material.

I don't consider myself intelligent and I'm predicted A*A*B  
 
 
The majority of people who get good grades are intelligent, insofar as they realize their situation and that which may benefit them later in life.
The majority of people who get bad grades are not academically intelligent, though, as we all know, there are multiple areas of intelligence.
 
 
Not necessarily - nowadays with awarding bodies like AQA, you could memorise the mark schemes and get full marks / UMS, which doesn't not require a lot of effort or intelligence - just the ability to source the past papers and their mark schemes.
 
 
I'd say a lot of the time, intelligent people get good grades and less intelligent people don't. However, grades aren't a reliable indicator of intelligence at all. You can be as clever as you want but if you're bad at memorising stuff for exams, you let the pressure get to you or don't have great exam technique, you're f***ed.
 
 
A large majority of intelligent people have top grades. Likewise, a lot of people with top grades are very intelligent. But not all intelligent people have top grades, and not everyone with top grades is very intelligent. I normally see it as an indicator of intelligence, rather than anything that proves intelligence

How is knowing pointless facts intelligence? Surely you don't define intelligence as knowing a collection of stuff.

You set the pace probably means you are the person who thinks they know everything in the class, but is in fact very annoying. AAA is easy if you are intelligent. I managed to easily get three A's even in further maths that is meant to be one of the hardest you can get.

Maybe, you are pseudo intellectual.

Were those high grades in geography?
 
 
the thing is, if grades arent a measure of intelligence and mean nothing, why are the people who say that usually not the people who get straight A*s?

edit: im not saying that grades are the best indicator, but if you can get 5 A*s at a level without busting a gut and without memorising mark schemes, i dont think its fair to say that it counts for nothing..
 
 
Intelligence is somewhat of a broad subject. You could consider Andy Warhol an intelligent person, as you can with Einstein. Intelligence imo is a balance of creativity, reasoning, planning, problem solving, self-awareness, appreciation of the things you have, precision, accuracy, attention to detail etc... There are so many factors to balance in - while grades do test this somewhat, i don't think they test you as much as they should.

not with any ranking system based on logic
 
 
grades =/= intelligence by any stretch.
It is entirely possible to get top grades by just rote learning, which requires no intelligence.

However, since intelligence makes it EASIER to get top grades, there is some rough correlation.
 
 
At the risk of failing an intelligence test, I would like to know how to view signatures

So an art GCSE is based on logic? What about a design a level?

Let's rewind to the time when I said an art or design GCSE or A level was a logical intelligence rank system....
 
 
Definitely not! Grades =/= intelligence (but there is a weak positive correlation, with some anomalies).

There is a reason why Oxbridge interview (+ entrance tests and the like).
 
 
why are you on a health and relationships forum?! This is completely irrelevant...
 
 
I could be an interesting case in point for this question...up until GCSEs I got fairly mediocre grades (Bs and low As in the main throughout my school career, a smattering of Cs), 3A*s 5As and 3Bs at GCSE.

That changed at A Level purely because my attitude towards education changed. I got interested in the material I was studying, and interested in learning it properly, not just to the extent that I could spew it onto an exam page at the end of the year and be done with it.

That made me work not just harder but smarter, learning how I learnt and how I could utilize time more effectively. I also learnt to utilize assignments to help me remember things and learn techniques, rather than just doing them for the sake of meeting the deadline and not being "given a talking to".

Just my experience, but I would say the difference between getting mediocre grades and top grades for me was becoming interested in learning beyond grades. Imo it's less about intelligence (I didn't become any more intelligent, just utilized it differently), and more about motivation. There is obviously some degree of intelligence involved though.
 
 
It's not that linear but grades are a good measure of one's intelligence. Of course there are those cases of people that get low grades but are really intelligent. Those are, however, the exceptions, not the rule.
As an example, I think that on average, the intelligence of the people in my course matches the grades needed to get in.
 
 
Well a lot of people think that good grades = intelligence (which isn't completely untrue). However, I wouldn't consider myself not intelligent, not the brightest, but there are certain areas that I excel in.

I NEVER do good in exams. I find I'm giddy with happiness if I get a B and I rarely get any A's. I dunno what it is, but I've ALWAYS done better in coursework than actual exams. I get really high grades in essays for example (esp in anything Health and Social Care association) but then I do average in exams and nothing special or wow. Lucky for me I've been able to balance out the two for an overall grade (in 6th form subjects anyway).

Maybe it's down to my learning technique or the fact that when I study, the info I learn for exams never stays long in my head, Idk, it's just the way it is with me!
 
 
I'm not intelligent, just good at exams. To make it worse, I want to do medicine, where true intelligence is needed.

Thats not really true. I personally knew a few people in my year who had extra tuition in all subjects, did a LOT of work and only managed Cs and Ds, even with retakes. Unis look for people who are talented AND who can manage the workload.
 
 
It takes a stupid person to say that they are intelligent and show the world that they are stupid... but it takes the whole world to show that someone is intelligent.

Hawking, Fry or Rowling, for example, did not walk into firms starting off with "I'm clever, I got grades". They worked hard and proved themselves.

Intelligent people prove themselves. Stupid people work for a year, get grades then claim they've succeeded in life. Newsflash: nowhere close.
 
 
I'm intelligent (well, i think i am) but I never get the grades I wanted or expected.
I can't revise or cram information, it takes a lot of time to get in so I often have to study at home just to understand it. Waste of my time tbh, I wish I was like everyone else  

*And, as the previous post said. I want to do Medicine and this just makes it worse...  
 
 
grades ? intelligence

Really? :\

I find it hard to see how anyone gets Cs and Ds across the board.

I mean, fair enough, I had one C at AS, but I didn't put a lot of work into that subject. With enough work anyone can get at least a B.

I like your answer   it would be nice to achieve something though, just as reassurance.

 
I'm the opposite I'm not smart but seem to get good grades. I'm a MASTER crammer and my brain is like a sponge, I can memorise 6 full essays before and exam and in exam I usually carefully remember my answers. I got 4 A's last year in my A Levels and I'm going to UCL to study Law this September and I'm ****ting myself for when they find out I'm not actually intelligent just a MEGA crammer

NOOOOOOO fair, i'm supposed to be smart but i got mentally full of myself so only got 2 A's :'( :'(

Don't put that much pressure on yourself. You're young; you've still probably got your twenties to go.
 
 
Scores on tests of intelligence are the single best predictor of academic performance.

Academic performance is not a significant predictor of intelligence.

Meh, I've known people who are clearly intelligent but have awful organisation and **** themselves at exams. They normally win through by their mid 20's though, even if they will be crap at exams for perpetuity.

grades is simply a measurement of how well you can remember the text book
 
 
Sooner or later you will realise grades mean very little in the grand scheme of things. It's just a piece of paper and as long as you dont stay tied down to the notion that a bad grade can hold you back you will be fine.

In fact unless you want to be a Doctor/Lawyer/etc. grades mean practically nothing and you can achieve without them. My advice is dont be restricted by the idea of a job or a career. If you want lots of money, start your own business, no job can compare. If you want to travel, GO, nothing is stopping you. Whatever makes you happy is possible without getting good grades.
 
 
nah grades are not a very good measure of intelligence thats because a lot of variables fall into it such as
'slightly-less-intelligent' student could go to a generally better school than you, with better teachers and maybe more supportive parents
Getting good grades is also more about disciplining yourself to sit and spend your time REVISING rather than sitting an exam and being naturally intelligent about it. (especially when exam boards are so particular about what answer you give ):< and which keywords you use blahblah)

but hey, just my opinion - it is a measure of your knowledge, not intelligence. But i guess it stimulates your intelligence...?
 
 
I think that grades are more of a test for your memory, well for the most part; you do have to apply what you have memorised on paper, so there is a degree of 'learning.' Although, it's remarkable how you don't actually need to 'learn' and apply in most subjects, in order to get good grades. As for intelligence, that is just the capabilities of the mind; thus when someone says that you are 'intelligent' it means that you are exercising those capabilities at a rate which is above the norm. This could be seen as talent in academia for example. I like this quote from Arthur Schopenhauer, "Talent can hit a target no one else can hit; genius hits a target noone else can see." With enough effort, anyone can become talented, and exercise their capability in one field, genius, however, is very hard to find.

Good luck trying to do a PhD with a 3rd in your undergraduate degree!  

(Someone will probably quote me with an anecdote of that happening, but generally speaking?)
 
 
No. Not really.
 
 
An ape would be more intelligent then any A* student if they were stranded in the middle of a jungle.

Unless the A* student also lived in the jungle on a day to day basis.

I meant grades at GCSE/Alevel as that is what the OP was on about.

Degrees are different, thats generally something you want to do, most people feel pressured by there parents to do Alvls and I guarantee not everyone got subjects they enjoy and GCSE's, you dont really have a choice

Maybe because you've set yourself these aims which you feel like you HAVE to get, it causes you to actually underperform because of nervousness or something (it used to happen to me)

Just be patient and work hard, when studying for an exam try not to constantly think about what you wanna achieve (Eg.As). Consistently work at a good pace and no worries you'll get what you want.
 
 
theres a correlations, a fairly strong one as well? but its not perfect about 0.8 maybe
 
 
The whole grades = intelligence thing is much more socially constructed than a lot of people realise. You need to be clever enough to get good grades but not as clever as you might expect. On the other hand, a lot of really intelligent people don't do well at school/university for different reasons. School/university and academia in general suit some people better than others regardless of intelligence. A person with an iq of 105 as long as they have discipline and have been in education for enough time can get a first class honours from any uk institution (including Oxbridge) whereas someone with an IQ of 130 (98th percentile) who also tries really hard might not do as well. People have different learning styles and abilities and sometimes undiagnosed disabilities, which hinders them in a rigid education system which doesn't suit everybody's strengths.

I'm terrible at exams (and i mean really bad) but i do really well at coursework, and it averages out to an acceptable level, but i don't believe this is a true measure of how intelligent i am or how hard i work or how successful i will be.
 
 
An example

Me: Educated at a state school in east London, achieved mostly Cs in my GCSEs
Friend: Educated at a private school in north London, achieved mostly As/Bs in his GCSEs

We both are on the same course at university, so far in our modules I have two firsts and he has two lower second class honours.

One anecdote does not buck the trend.
 
 
I do not think your grades are a valid representation of your intelligence. It's 1/3 intelligence 2/3 effort (according to a study my history teacher was on about).

Your grade is down to the effort you put in, not necessarily your intelligence. I do not believe that people can get top marks (90%) in A levels/degrees, without revising and just listening in class.

youre very wrong about a levels, dont know about degrees
 
 
 
youre very wrong about a levels, dont know about degrees

 

Well I don't. You try doing loads of A levels and getting over 90% overall in all them. I bet you wont do it, unless you revise.

Your grade just shows how much effort you put in, which is why i back the idea of your grade being at least 2/3 effort.
 
 
No, not really.

Doesn't suprise me.. my head of sixth form gave an assembly on this (bizarre, i know) but he said that it's often the case that when private school students go to university their grades suffer because they have spend their whole school career being spoon fed and prepped excessively for every little thing that they become almost incapable of independent learning and have to adjust.

Well done on the firsts, by the way  
 
 
No they don't measure intelligence at all. Quality of teaching is, to my mind, a major issue. I'll use a personal example. On my English exam I got an E so I put in for a resit. A few nights before the exam (without revision as I don't know how to revise) a friends mother gave me an hours worth of advice and I got an A
 
 
I noticed this a little. I'm doing 2 advanced highers this year and i noticed that there is a huge difference between the level of difficulty and the way you are taught between highers and advanced highers. And infact i asked my lecturer about this and he confirmed that the advanced highers system (i.e the way it is taught and the way you have to learn) are the same as what the way you are taught in university (at least in the 2 subjects i'm doing). Essentially in advanced highers you are taught to find the answer, whereas in highers you are taught the answer. Therefore to get an A in higher you basically just have to memorise the answer. However in advanced highers you actually need to use your intelectual ability to find the answer, understand it, explain it and possibly critique it.

Which actually explains why there are some people in my advanced higher classes that have a higher A in the subject but seem to know absolutely nothing about the subject  , and are really struggling this year.

Yeh my lecturer said exactly what you said, the people that stuggle the most in his classes seem to be the ex private school pupils that have been spoon fed.

he actually said it infront of the class and a couple of the ex private school pupils got all uppity about it.
 
 
I hate that term, intelligence...I mean I hate the term of IQ.

Yea, because, years ago me and some friends did a IQ test online. I got something like 80, that's like just above vegetables. I'm turning 21 and in Uni and my friends still pick on me for having such a low IQ...bastards.

Doesn't it also depend on the course? I'm ex-private school kid, but I never did the A-Levels. I did the IB, its hard for its own stupid reasons.
 
 
Hmm I wouldn't say grades definitely mean you're intelligent. I would argue however that intelligent people would generally see the sense in that working hard could mean the A grade is easily manageable and unintelligent would find it harder to spot that they can get great grades even without being intelligent.

Probably yeah.
 
 
I think there would be a good correlation, but then of course, how hard you work has a massive impact on your grades.

It's possible to be intelligent but lazy, and hence not get good grades.
 
 
Not really, it just summed up what you've learned in that grading. As for me, I have 5 A+'s and 2 A's and 3 B's. Actually, I don't take grades seriously but I still have the highest grade in our class. Grades isn't about intelligence, it's like a test that modifies how far you can go. =)
 
 
Grades = Ability to communicate intelligence
 
 
Read Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell.
 
 
There's a slight correlation between the two but I don't think that it's an absolute causal link, there's a lot of factors that could play a part so I don't think good grades necessarily mean intelligence.
 
 
You can get A's without revising. I've always got A's in English without breaking a sweat. If I tried to do that with other subjects which I'm not nearly as good at...well that's what I did and my A levels were ACDE. If only I had a work ethic. lol
 
 
 
How is knowing pointless facts intelligence? Surely you don't define intelligence as knowing a collection of stuff.

 

An awareness of what's going on in the world isn't pointless. This person seen the news report that we'd left Iraq, and asked me why two years later there's still reports of the Army fighting there...
 
 
 
Intelligence has many factors.

Knowledge is but one of them.

 

Well said.
 
 
 
They're both in Helmand.

 

wtf luv just wtf.
 
 
You could write a piece of coursework that sounds brilliant but still get a C because you didn't follow the mark scheme. It's all about making sure you tick every box. In my eyes, that doesn't really make you intelligent.
 
 
 
Grades are more about your ability to memorize the mark schemes  

 

Ain't that true  
 
 
 
Scores on tests of intelligence are the single best predictor of academic performance.

Academic performance is not a significant predictor of intelligence.

Psychology student, signing out.

 

But if scores on intelligence tests predict academic performance

And academic performance does not predict intelligence

This post is a logical fail
 
 
I really don't think grades always = intelligence.

I was in the top sets at GCSE and predicted As and Bs, but I didn't achieve those grades for personal reasons which I don't want to discuss on an internet forum! My grades meant I then couldn't get into uni, which I seriously regret.

It makes for awkwardness in job interviews if they ask why my grades are low - I can't really tell them the real reason - real interview killer right there. Flashing red and blue lights to the employer!

Just because someone doesn't have the best GCSEs/A Levels doesn't mean they are stupid or not capable. I regret the way I handled situations as a teenager and not realising the value of GCSE and A Level grades. Now employers look at me as if I have the level of intelligence of a five year old.
 
 
grades are about work rate.
innate smarts only gets you so far.
 
 
 
Well I don't. You try doing loads of A levels and getting over 90% overall in all them. I bet you wont do it, unless you revise.

Your grade just shows how much effort you put in, which is why i back the idea of your grade being at least 2/3 effort.

 

Its definitely a lot of effort, I saw my Biology AS go from a C last year to a B this year (with 1 module going from a C to an A) and that was purely down to the hours and HOURS of revision I put in, not because I suddenly gained a huge amount of intelligence in 6 months.
 
 
No, my bird got bad grades at A-level (around 160 ucas points) where as i got 300ucas points but you can't tell the difference between us intelligence wise, she's far more clue up with what's going on in the world, it's quite hard to outwit her and she has a lot more common sense than a lot of people i know who go to uni.

Likewise i know people who went to much better universities than me but are thick as sh*t just cos they can store a lot of information for a short amount of time.
 
 
 
Hi,

First off I'd like to establish that I'm kind of intelligent, I may not be a candidate for Oxbridge or anything, however I've always been in the top sets, put on the 'Gifted and Talented' register (which I think is pointless, but yeah) and quite academically bright.

However I've never really achieved the grades I've been predicted or want to achieve, not necessarily failing, mainly B's and a few A's, however I never really perform to my expectation or anyone else's expectation as I always have teachers asking me why I never performed as well as I 'should have'

It's something which as always annoyed me, especially as in class I generally 'set the pace' (that was taken from my school report) I'm possibly just venting, but it's really frustrating, I genuinely put in all the effort I can (although never really manage time too well, because of other activities, friends etc.) It's just rather annoying I guess.

I got diagnosed with anxiety from a young age, but I'm not going to allow that to be a excuse for under performing.

 

I am quite the same.
 
 
 
You can get A's without revising. I've always got A's in English without breaking a sweat. If I tried to do that with other subjects which I'm not nearly as good at...well that's what I did and my A levels were ACDE. If only I had a work ethic. lol

 

Wow i'm jealous of you and well done! but to be fair English is an A level which you can pass without revising, you just need to be able to know how to structure the exam and remember brief things like poem names and a few quotes, (i'm not saying its an easy a level i think its one of the hardest).

And also, that's 1 A out of 4/3 a levels... Surely to get like 3 A grade A levels you would of had to done a considerable amount of revision.

Yeah, I agree. I'd have to say that I fall apart at exams but since I've always done well in English there's no real fear but always a danger nonetheless. Never bothered learning spelling tests earlier on in school either because I didn't need to.

Not saying much though. Maybe if I'd attained more than the one A. Done with exams for now anyway. Deliberately chose a university where the course didn't involve exams.

I think I just got cocky and assumed that because I did so well in one area that it would translate across which it didn't. That and I convinced myself that I was so terrible at exams revision wouldn't make a difference.
 
 
 
But if scores on intelligence tests predict academic performance

And academic performance does not predict intelligence

This post is a logical fail

 

No it's not. It's basic statistics. Just because looking at grass is a good predictor of seeing the colour green doesn't make seeing the colour green a good predictor of looking at grass.

You might be intelligent, but if you're lazy you won't get anywhere.

Besides, you're getting A's and B's even though you don't bother working. Shut up.

well your idea is a massive generalization but partly true in some cases.

i do maths, further maths, physics and chemistry, get 90 in exams and my homework completion is "cause for concern". i really dont do much revision. in some cases, revision will boost your grades significantly but honestly, some people can just do a levels because they guide you through questions (certainly in maths/science) meaning if you havent revised, you can easily figure out what you need to do. your grade doesnt always show how much effort you put in, some people can do a levels without revising because a levels dont stretch anywhere near as much as they should.

Just because my idea doesn't apply to you, doesn't make it a 'massive generalisation' as you count for a very small proportion of A level students.

I very much doubt the average A level student can achieve 3/4 A*/A grade A levels without put any effort into it, regarding outside of class learning, unless you have like x2 the amount of lessons the normal A level student has. Studies etc have all backed up this idea, because it's said that your brain remembers something like 10 - 20% of what you learn in class, and 10/20% of the course's knowledge, wont exactly get you top marks...

I'm sure there are cases where people (as amazing as yourself) have had luck in the exams or really good teachers, but they count as very small proportion of people who take A levels - as if this was the case, there would be a hell of a lot more people achieving top marks.
 
 
Common sense is as equal as academics.
