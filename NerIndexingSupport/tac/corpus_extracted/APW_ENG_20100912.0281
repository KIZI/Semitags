Highveld Lions captain Alviro Petersen won the toss and chose to bowl first in Sunday's Champions League Twenty20 Group B match against South Australia at SuperSport Park in Centurion, near Pretoria.

The Lions made one change to the team that surprised Mumbai Indians to win the tournament opener in Johannesburg on Friday. Bowler Werner Coetsee is in for Shane Burger, who has a back injury.

Jonathan Vandiar and Neil McKenzie, who both made half-centuries against Mumbai, are retained.

South Australia named Australia batsmen Graham Manou and Callum Ferguson and fast bowler Shaun Tait for its first match of the tournament.

There is no place for Tait's fellow paceman Peter George, who was recently called into the Australia squad.

South Australia is also missing international allrounders Shahid Afridi and Kieron Pollard.

Afridi is on tour with Pakistan in England, and Pollard is playing for South Australia's Group B rival Mumbai Indians in the Champions League. Indian Premier League sides, including the Indians, have the option of retaining players who have played for them in the IPL.
