 
 
Who Is A Real Jew? Disagreements among Jewish factions over the settlments.
 
 
Below is an  article printed in the NY Times , and underneath that a  commentary blog post  by a friend of mine, Adam David Segal, who also uses the internet moniker Rustee John.

 
LONDON  Ira Stup was raised in Philadelphia attending Jewish day school and camps. He found his home in the Jewish community and was intoxicated with Jewish democracy as framed in the ideals of Israels foundation. Now he has returned deeply troubled from a one-year fellowship based in Tel Aviv.

Damon Winter/The New York Times

The worst single incident occurred on Ben Yehuda Street in central Jerusalem. Stup, 24, a Columbia graduate, was returning from a rally with a couple of friends carrying a banner that said, Zionists are not settlers. A group of religious Jews wearing yarmulkes approached, spat on them and started punching.

About 20 people saw the whole thing and just watched. They were screaming, You are not real Jews. Most of them were American. It was one of the most disappointing moments of my life  you can disagree as much as you want with a banner but to allow violence and not react is outrageous. For me it was a turning point. Nobody previously had said I was not a real Jew.

The view that American Jews supportive of Israel but critical of its policies are not real Jews is, however, widespread. Israel-right-or-wrong continues to be the core approach of major U.S. Jewish organizations, from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) to the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations.

To oppose the continued expansion of settlements in the West Bank (Zionists are not settlers), or question growing anti-Arab bigotry as personified by Israels rightist foreign minister and illustrated by the loyalty oath debate, or ask whether the de-legitimization of Israel might not have something to do with its own actions is to incur these organizations steady ire.

Debate remains stifled, despite Peter Beinarts important piece this year in the New York Review of Books describing growing alienation among young American Jews asked to check their liberalism at Zionisms door. Oh, sure, you can find all sorts of opinions about Israel all over the place; America remains an open society. But Aipac has systematically shunned a debate with J Street, the upstart Jewish organization that supports Israel, opposes the settlements and attempts to reclaim the progressive ideals of Zionism by saying that the systematic oppression of the Palestinians undermines Israel.

These organizations view remains essentially that any time you engage in an activity critical of Israel you are trying to destroy the state of Israel, Jeremy Ben-Ami, the president of J Street, told me. Here are all these Jewish kids being raised on great liberal values at Hebrew schools  walks for the homeless, Darfur, AIDS  but God forbid we talk about whats happening in Israel! Its a dynamic that cuts off discourse.

The issues are worth debating at the highest level. Middle East talks have just broken down again, precisely over settlements. President Barack Obama had virtually no domestic constituency for his attempt to denounce the continued growth of settlements as unacceptable and as undermining a two-state peace at its core: land.

Obama was left dangling, more so after the midterms, and had to retreat. This is not merely a failure of the parties. It is a failure of U.S. politics and the way those politics are straitjacketed by an Israel-right-or-wrong mantra that leads inexorably, over time, to one state with more Arabs in it than Jews. What then will remain of the Zionist dream?

Stups research took him often to the West Bank. He would come back to Tel Aviv and talk about Palestinian humiliation hed seen and found that Israelis seemed unaware or unconcerned. He read in one newspaper that 53 percent of Israeli Jews would encourage Israeli Arabs to leave  and I saw and felt that anecdotally.

A painful question hardened: Seeing what the occupation looked like, and given the ideals of Jewish democracy I was raised on, I wondered: Could Israel be failing and could we American Jews be defending that failure?

Its time to think again and, above all, think openly. Last month, Ben-Ami was scheduled to speak at a Reform Jewish synagogue, Temple Beth Avodah, in Newton, near Boston. At the last minute the event got canceled because of what the rabbi described as strong opposition from a small, influential group within the congregation.

Jewish groups, or Hillel societies, on U.S. campuses sometimes discover they will lose their biggest donors if they allow a J Street youth group to form within them.

Last month, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, speaking to the Jewish Federations of North America in New Orleans, was heckled by protesters holding banners suggesting the occupation and loyalty oaths de-legitimize Israel. Their banners were ripped (with teeth) and the young Jews dragged out. Where an important conversation could be held, confrontation prevails.

Stup, moved to act, has joined J Street. This decision caused tremendous pressure on his family back in Philadelphia. One very close family friend came over to his mothers house recently and accused him of poisoning the minds of young Jews. The friendship has been strained to breaking point.

Why, Stup asked me, is it poisoning minds to encourage them to think critically about the actions of the Israeli government?
 

================================================== =====

 
response to the article, its quite intricate and there are several issues that should be discussed. The biggest problem is that these individual problems get merged into one big mess and it is impossible to distinguish the logical fallacies from the truth without scrutinizing the issue - something the average young adult does not have the attention-span to do.
I think it will be easier to address the article step by step and then I will give you my opinion on what the real issues are.

The first paragraph of this article is the perfect indication of two wrongs not making a right. I have a serious issue with any person who jumps on the bandwagon of an ideology without knowing what the true meaning behind that ideology is. I have seen some ridiculous things including protesters at a Greenpeace type event signing a petition against Dihydrogen Monoxide (H2O). What defines a Zionist? What defines a Settler? I find it ironic that the group of protesters attacked the ideological values of the settlers but get upset when they are faced with a similar attack on their own ideology. The protesters accused the settlers of not being real Zionists but are insulted when they are accused of not being real Jews. They cancel each other out. My only issue with this stalemate is the violence. We don't know what really happened but either way, violence is unacceptable. I wouldn't recommend instigating the violence either and so both parties are wrong.

It's one of the things I hate about this country, the unnecessary aggression and total disregard to the value of human life. I have a serious issue with the Haredi movements who attempt to physically harm or humiliate others because they do not share the same ideologies. Any person who spits on another or throws trash or gets violent has not right to call himself a devout Jew or a good human being.
The second issue is that of being critical of the Israeli government. With all due respect, unless someone is a tax-payer and/or lives here embedded in the cultural issues, they really are arguing out of ignorance. American Jews who feel this need to have a moral high-ground tend to speak out of turn. One cannot support Israel but not support Israel. Either you support Israel's right to exist and Israel's right to build on land that it owns, or you don't. There is no middle ground here. The idea of "I support Israel but not her policies" is akin to saying "I believe in the Torah but not all the bits that require me to put in effort".
Let's do a comparison to bring in some perspective. Israel occupies an area of land (about the size of New Jersey) which has grown due to strategic gain in wars from 1948 until today. Despite what the U.N. and Arab League might want you to believe, a lot of this land has either been legally won in war and signed over in cease-fire treaties or was ours to begin with in the original plans for the Israel-Transjordan splitting of the British Mandate of Palestine.

The United States currently "occupies" not only a land mass of approximately 10M KM^2 but has military forces in several countries (which Muslims consider an occupation) including Afghanistan and Iraq where two Wars have been ongoing for almost a decade and thousands of lives have been lost and countless lives destroyed.
Approximate distance between Washington D.C. and Kabul is 7000 Miles, approximate distance between Sderot and Gaza less than 1 mile. Rocket strikes on Israel this year from Gaza - 200; Attacks on Washington, none since 1812 (correct me if I am wrong).

Now that we have that out of the way, it leads me to a question. How can any American have a grasp of the reality of the situation when our cultural texts are so far apart that there could never be a clear and direct translation of the issue? The closest comparison we have is the WTC Attacks of 9/11 and if you take a look at the research done on public opinion at the time, there was a huge rise in patriotism, trust in government, and support for defense budget was the highest in 30 years. Research also shows that "Americans possess lingering resentment and reservations about Arab and Muslim Americans."
So again, to put that into perspective, A single attack on America which kills 3000 people leads to a drastic change in public opinion. Since 2000, Israel has lost 1200 people to Terrorism, a further 8300 people have been wounded (reality check: limbs lost, bodies burned and mutilated, faces scarred). That doesn't take into consideration the 2500 people killed in acts of terrorism in Israel from 1920-1999 and it doesn't include the wars. For more details, feel free to look at  Israeli casualties of war - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 

The result of almost 100 years of terror, is what we have today. If any of these so called Zionists did any homework at all on what has actually happened here in the last 100 years, they would not dare criticize settlement building or post-1967 borders. The reason they do is because they are ignorant of the truth and while I would love to blame this entirely on them, the blame lies squarely on the shoulders of Israeli governments who for years have ignored the concept of PR and agenda setting.

Several months ago, I got into a heated debate with the head of the IDF spokesperson unit. I argued with her that the difference between our media and Arab media is that ours is sterile. There are no pictures of corpses, no blood, no body parts, no women and children. On the contrary, a Palestinian camera crew will make sure to film the suffering and show it to the world. She told me that we are better than that, I told her that she was stupid and that she was fighting a losing battle because when people see our news footage of a whole in the ground, versus their news footage where women and children are covered in blood, it doesn't take a genius to figure out who the average non-player is going to feel worse for.

While Joe Shmoe for Kentucky has every reason to fall for the appeal to emotion, a Jewish American should know better. A Jewish American should be required to do his or her homework before criticizing the Israeli government. I criticize them every day but I like to think that I know what I am talking about. I have done the research and I have lived the life of an Israeli - maybe not in Sderot and maybe not serving in combat like some of my friends but I am still enveloped in the Arab-Israeli conflict.

When an American "Zionist" criticizes Israel for building in the settlements, do they actually know what they are talking about? Do they know that land for peace does not work? Do they know that since Gaza was given to the "Palestinians", over 4000 rockets have landed in Israel? Do they know that by ceding more land, we are bringing the rocket launchers closer to Tel Aviv - That cool place where liberal Jewish Americans go when they get their free ticket to Israel. Do they know that the liberation of the "Palestinians" is a ruse. There is NO SUCH THING as a Palestinian as they are currently defined. These Arabs in Israel are nothing more than a bunch of Jordanians who got lost in the shuffle when they bet on the wrong horse in 1948. The reason that Jordan revoked their citizenship is to prevent what Israel faces today - an intifada. Any person who does their homework will find that Jordanian news did not even broadcast the intifada. Surely they would want to show their brothers suffering? However, they were not prepared to take the risk that refugees in Jordan got the same idea. Of course your average liberal American has no idea of the inner-politics of the Middle East, he just has a big mouth and the First Amendment.

In my harsh opinion. American Jews who turn on their Israeli brethren are worse than the Kapos in the Holocaust. They knowingly choose to turn their backs on their people who are in a state of constant terror and war. In return, they get to pretend that they are Zionists while living their material lives far away from the reality that they so harshly criticize. The best of both worlds. In my opinion, any non-Israeli who criticizes Israel's need to build and defend itself is a traitor who want to have his cake and eat it too. If Israel succumbs to the pressure and is lost in war, who do these people think the Arabs will be after next?

As you may know, I am no fan of Arabs and I think Islam is a curse on this world. But of all the Arabs in the world, the ones I dislike the most are the "Israeli-Arabs" I see every day in the mall, in the cinema or at the beach. They drive nice cars, their wives are decked out with all the nicest jewelry and designer clothing. They live the most wonderful lives and yet they say nothing in support of Israel and the government who allows them to do so. Meanwhile, those in Gaza are being killed by Hamas for singing at weddings and despite that, there reason to hate me is more justified because they actually experience the pain we put them through, justified or not.

My point is simple, the Arabs stick together, they may kill each other but when it comes to us vs. them, they know to support their own. Jews on the other hand seem to like nothing more than to put their own down publicly. I don't care how much you disagree with Israeli politics, the world sees Israel as the land of the Jews and it is every Jew's responsibility to support Israel and its legitimacy in public. We are completely justified in our actions, we have a right to live on the land we own and we have a right to defend ourselves against a constant threat. Any Jew who disagrees is more than welcome to come to Israel and stay in Sderot while the rockets are falling. Let's see if they are willing to put their money where their mouth is.

I apologize if its not as smoothly flowing as intended but I hope you can put the pieces together as to my 2 shekels on the situation. I look forward to discussing it with you in more detail soon.

Mostly I thought it was an angry tirade. He openly hates israeli arabs. The above position would mean the entire region was Jordan pre Israel which of course it wasn't. The region was known as Palastine for more time in human history than it's been known as Israel. I think your friends pov is a step above the average Palestinians but only a small step. I'd say the average Israeli has no idea what he's talking about when speaking about the average liberal American. I wonder if your friend realizes many of his conservative chevangelical blind supporters of Israel do so to hurry the slaughter of the jews in the apocalypse....it needs a jewish state to occur where as many liberals wish for a stable safe israeli state.
 
 
I understood that the jews were the descendants of the tribes of Judah, Levi and Benjamin historically.
 
 
Edited the title, came to the thread expecting to see something antisemitic.

As a matter of fact, Adam is one of the smartest and most well informed people I've ever had the pleasure to meet. He's just graduated his Undergrad with distinctions, and is the kind of person to logically back up every single argument he makes with fact. I can agree with you that my opinion matter nothing when it comes to his arguments, but please respond to his arguments instead of attacking the person.
 
 
We've always had the notion of Jew as a religion and have had the oft debated notion of Jew as a race. Maybe it's time to look at the idea of Jew as a nationality as well....
 
 
The use of rocket attacks against civilian targets greatly weakens any positions held by the Palestinians, IMO, any retaliation is part of the situation, an effect, not the cause. The idea of not allowing the rockets to move closer to Israel's cities is a hard one to argue against.

Perhaps your freind should take your advice?

 
In my harsh opinion. American Jews who turn on their Israeli brethren are worse than the Kapos in the Holocaust.

In return, they get to pretend that they are Zionists while living their material lives far away from the reality that they so harshly criticize. The best of both worlds.

That paragraph is like asking a man when he stopped kicking his dog. It leaves no room for discussion.

never mind that he argues from a fallacious premise.

Do they know that since Gaza was given to the "Palestinians", over 4000 rockets have landed in Israel?

the part I bolded is an utter falshood since israel is not ceeding land. The settlements by thier very nature are in the midst of land already held by the Palestinians. But he would rather use ad hominems against those who dissagree with him.
 
 
When I was a very young boy I asked a coworker of my father and friend of the family (who is of jewish descend) if he considered himself jewish, after he mentioned that he is an Atheist. He answered that he believes that it is a religion and since he does not believe in god he is not jewish. His wife (religous & jewish) replied. "Darling, of course you are jewish..you are just not very good at it".
 
 
Who is the real Jew? That statement is such a laugh and a half that is not funny. Both articles are exercise in hyprocies. The first article assumes that anyone of Jewish blood, ie if you or your mother was f*cked by a Jew, then you have a say in Israeli politics. The 2nd article states that unless you're borned Jewish on the Holy Land, then you have no say. What a load of crock on both. As long as either side takes our money and our support, then we have a say whether either side likes it or not. Hell, even the Chinese, the most non-Arab and non-Judeo people you can get told both the Arabs and the Israelis to screw off.

Sir,

the second article is evern worse than you have written. While the author says that no one who doesn't live & pay taxes in Israel should have an opinion, he targets his vitriol exclusively at those he disagrees with. So what he is effectively saying is that no jew outside Israel who disagrees with his perspectve should have an opinion. In fact, if they disagree with the Israeli Govt. they are worse than concentration camp collaborators. Nasty stuff. personally I prefered they guys in the street spitting - at least they personally faced the people they insulted.
 
 
The obvious answer to that is that anyone pointing an AK47 at an Israeli, or anyone supplying that AK47 aiming at an Israeli, has a say whether the Israelis likes it or not.
 
 
Adam's attack on those who disagree with him prevents an honest discussion on the issues. I expect that for Jews, the term kapo is the equivalent of the fascist or racist attack.

If we presume that Israel has a right to exist, then where does that right derive from?

If it only derives from the strength of the Israeli military to protect it, then the Palestinians need only last one day longer than Israel to remove the right and they would be foolish to give up since they have nothing to lose that Israel has not already demonstrated they will take at will.

If however Israel's rights stem from the right of the Jewish people to self determination, then the same right exists for the Palestinians. Taking more and more land for settlements is thus theft of land via micro invasion and illegal. Again the Palestinians would be foolish to give up.

The settlements do not serve Israel unless the creation of a siege mentality is the goal. I fear Joshua's model for dealing with the natives is going to fail this time around. Israel is not willing to exterminate the Palestinians, and the Palestinians are out breeding the Jews. Until Israel stops playing the victim card and owns up to the mess it created by its micro invasions the standoff is going to continue.
 
 
adam's article in three sentences:

palestinians don't exist and their grievances are all fake. they're all terrorists or support terrorists anyway, so we jews need to stick together like they do and back our government in screwing them as hard as we can. if you don't agree with this, you're a kapo.

I'm also wondering if the corollary to 'jews who disagree with me are kapos' is 'gentiles who disagree with me are anti-semites'.

You asked what I thought I told you. I posted a small example and your friend was the one who stated he hates Israeli Arabs. What your friend misses that many American jews equate Israeli with Israel not American jews as Israelis. He also denied the existence of Palestinians instead calling them Jordanians and I pointed out the land was called Palestine all but 130 of the last 2000 years and had large christian then Muslim majorities till the last century. That is not in any way meant to mean I don't strongly support the rights of those living in israel today to live in peace which has been denied them it's just a factual truth he denied.
 
 
 
Israeli as a nationality not a race

 

Jews are a nation outside of Israel. Nation can mean a state or a people. In this context it is a people since race is to specific to a genetic group. Americans are also a nation in that we have a shared history, culture and language as one people despite the various races that comprise us.
 
 
zraver, et al,

I'm not Jewish. In fact, I'm not much of anything, other than an American. But I'll be damned if I can figure-out what the agenda is, what the intent is, of this question.

Legalities aside, you are what your heart tells you --- you are. Each person knows where their loyalties and allegiance rests. (Yes! It is really that simple.)

The first step to defeating a superior force, is to disassemble them and destroy them from the inside out. The first sign of decline is fighting amongst yourselves.

Whatever the "Israelis" (the nationality and object of allegiance) are doing, they need to be unified. They have to stop thinking like they are a scattered group of people that descend from the diaspora and ancient Hebrews. They have to know "who they are." OR, there will come a time when they are nothing.

Once they accomplish this, then they can decide as a collective and unified people, if they inside or outside the construct of international law.

 
Article 8: War crimes 2. For the purpose of this Statute, "war crimes" means: (b) Other serious violations of the laws and customs applicable in international armed conflict, within the established framework of international law, namely, any of the following acts: (viii) The transfer, directly or indirectly, by the Occupying Power of parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies, or the deportation or transfer of all or parts of the population of the occupied territory within or outside this territory;

 

The issue of the Settlements (a politically and emotionally charged topic) is mutually exclusive to your loyalty and allegiance. They either are - or are not - "Israelis." That is all that matters in the here and now.

Israelis don't necessarily have to be Jewish. And the Settlers don't necessarily have to be Israeli. But it seems to me that it is time for these people to declare their allegiance. They seem to be confused.

I gathered that the question was embedded in the thread. Who Is A Real Jew? Dissagrements among Jewish factions over the settlments. Your post just seemed to be a window of opportunity to comment.

While this is a valid strategic view in a conventional conflict; it is not necessarily the practical tactical view in an unconventional warfare scenario.

True. But before you can choose to fight for a cause, you have to pick a side.

Adam has perused the thread, at the moment he has neglected to join us here on WAB (I'm working on that). However, he has mailed me a response to a few posters at the same time:

@ Zraver - My reference to Kapos is to emphasize that while Jews who turn their backs on Israel today have 100% free choice to do so, Kapos were ordered to do many vile things in order to save their own lives. If Kapos have such a bad reputation in Jewish culture, why should these people be any different when they actively seek to deligitimize and harm their brothers.

@Zraver - How can the settlements be on land that belongs to the PA when the land was captured in War and consequent truces were made. Go look into the Armistice agreement between Jordan and Israel. Furthermore, take a look at the 6-Day War, despite the fact that we won the land in war, we offered it back in exchange for peace. Egypt ultimately signed a ceasefire and got Sinai back, we're still waiting to hear from Syria and 40 years later, I would say the deal is off the table.

By giving back strategic positions we won in war we are 100% CEDING land! In fact, we ceded the Gaza strip to the PA who lost it to a terrorist organization which resulted in thousands of rocket attacks. "Fool me once..."

@Office of Egineers: Not sure what he read, I never said if you weren't born in Israel you don't have an opinion. My point is don't claim to be a Zionist while simultaneously bashing Israel. Its easy to tour Tel Aviv, living in Sderot is a different issue.

@Bigfella - Its easy to make a statement about me not facing you. Please come to Israel, I will welcome you into my home and we can discuss over water-pipe until the sun comes up.

@Astralis - My argument in three sentences:

The modern day nationalism of the Palestinian people is a farce; nowhere in history were Palestinians only Arab/Muslim. Jews, Christians and Muslims living in the territory known as Palestine were Palestinians. If they can't share the entire Middle East with one country of Jews the size of New Jersey, thats their problem.
 
 
BR,

It is difficult to have a conversation by proxy, but I would make a couple of brief responses:

 
@Bigfella - Its easy to make a statement about me not facing you. Please come to Israel, I will welcome you into my home and we can discuss over water-pipe until the sun comes up.

 

It is even easier to make blanket statements about hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of people you know you will never personally have to address. I didn't personalize the statement because it appeared to be directed at American Jews rather than gentiles. While you may very well be prepared to say the same to them in person, the very nature of that piece allowed you to make a blanket stsement that will never have to be defended one on one with everyone you defamed.

The guys on the street spitting on people they had decided were not Jews at least had to face the immediate consequences of their actions. The fact that you used a well written article rather than saliva doesn't make what your behaviour any more commendable to me.

 
@Astralis - My argument in three sentences:

The modern day nationalism of the Palestinian people is a farce; nowhere in history were Palestinians only Arab/Muslim. Jews, Christians and Muslims living in the territory known as Palestine were Palestinians. If they can't share the entire Middle East with one country of Jews the size of New Jersey, thats their problem.
 

Last time I checked there were Christian Palestinians & since when does not wanting to be occupied by a foreign nation qualify as 'not wanting to share'. Last I checked the basic Palestinian demand is to have what Jews inside Israel & out can claim as their birthright - their own nation.

Using rhetorical devices to erase Palestinians from the past or present won't work any better than calling Macedonians 'slavophone Greeks' made them unexist.

Okay, no need for proxy then.

One can't talk about a nation, religion, sect etc without using blanket terms. To argue that point might be intellectually or aesthetically pleasing but it shies away from the issue at hand.

You seem to misunderstand the point that I am making. The Palestinian people who claim sovereignty today are not the same Palestinians who lived in the Biblical land of Palestine. If 53000 Mexicans decided to call themselves Native Americans whose home land has been occupied by the U.S., how far do you think they would get?

What about the aborigines? Does any caucasian have the right to call themselves Australian?

Why the double standard?

I have no qualms about calling people out on their hypocrisy but due to the insufficient time and resources available to me, I cannot address each person individually so my defamation will have to remain as such.

In any case, I would rather talk about the issue at hand.
 
 
adam,

 
The Palestinian people who claim sovereignty today are not the same Palestinians who lived in the Biblical land of Palestine.
 

so...are the israeli people who claim sovereignty today the same as the jews whom lived in the Biblical land of Judaea?
 
 
Not at all. We have just as much claim for why the land belongs to us based on historical heritage but it is what it is. I'll settle for what we have today as opposed to what we had before just because its only reasonable to do so.

The term Palestinian as it exists today has only been around since 1948. There was no Palestinian language, culture, literature, art or anything else which denotes a societal affiliation. They were mainly Muslims under the Ottoman empire. On the other hand, the Israelites lived in the land of Canaan/Palestine/Israel, we have Israeli/Jewish culture, language, literature, art and history. Furthermore, all 3 Semitic religions describe Israel as the land of the Israelites:

THE QUR'AN SAYS:

"To Moses We [Allah] gave nine clear signs. Ask the Israelites how he [Moses] first appeared amongst them. Pharoah said to him: 'Moses, I can see that you are bewitched.' 'You know full well,' he [Moses] replied, 'that none but the Lord of the heavens and the earth has revealed these visible signs. Pharoah, you are doomed.'"

"Pharoah sought to scare them [the Israelites] out of the land [of Israel]: but We [Allah] drowned him [Pharoah] together with all who were with him. Then We [Allah] said to the Israelites: 'Dwell in this land [the Land of Israel]. When the promise of the hereafter [End of Days] comes to be fulfilled, We [Allah] shall assemble you [the Israelites] all together [in the Land of Israel]."

"We [Allah] have revealed the Qur'an with the truth, and with the truth it has come down. We have sent you [Muhammed] forth only to proclaim good news and to give warning."

[Qur'an, "Night Journey," chapter 17:100-104]

Thus the Palestinians do not have a nationalist claim to the land, nor do they have a religious claim to the land as denoted by their own religious text.

You might argue that an Israeli is not the same as an Israelite but when one uses the word Palestinian today, the connotation is not the same as a person who lived in the historical land of Palestine. Why? United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181 - The Jews begrudgingly accepted the resolution while the Arabs rejected it and declared war on the state of Israel. The Arabs lost the war and this resulted in the displacement of almost a million Arabs.

Those Arabs would later become known as Palestinians whose ideology was to remove the Zionists from power in the region. Take a look at the history of the PLO or the Hamas charter and the true agenda rears its ugly head. This issue will not be resolved by ceding land, not even giving up Jerusalem. The law of Islam forbids land that was once ruled by Islam to be ruled by kufar and that is the reality of the Israeli-Arab conflict.
 
 
Adam, glad you could make it. Do me a favor and post an intro thread, and read the  http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/mem...val-guide.html  as well.

Cheers, mate!
 
 
adam,

 
They were mainly Muslims under the Ottoman empire. On the other hand, the Israelites lived in the land of Canaan/Palestine/Israel,
 

that's a poor way of comparison; if you look at the same time period, one could say "they were mainly jews under the ottoman empire", with no previous existing jewish state since the destruction of judah in 586 BCE. if you are going to limit legitimacy to those whom have cultural/historical ties to the land, then will you call for the deportation of ethiopian jews, russian jews, german jews, etc? all of whom have far closer historical ties to their various ancestral lands than the kingdom of judah.

in any case, i find it quite amusing that you're trying to tell palestinians that they're not...palestinians. it is as if a british imperialist circa early 1948 told david ben-gurion that he wasn't israeli and never would be israeli because there was no land of israel either now or in the past. it's not up to -you- to determine if a people have national consciousness or not....it's up to the people in question. they disagree with your analysis.

You are confusing the issue. Any Jew that is not a convert or descendant of a convert necessarily has a hereditary line that traces back to those who dwelled on the land. The same as black people born in the United States are considered more African than I am despite my being born in South Africa 25 odd years ago while their last African ancestor left Africa over 250 years ago.

Again, if a group of Mexicans declared themselves as Native American nationalists, would that give them a right to call the United States the occupied North American territories? We have evidence that Jews/Israelites lived in the land thousands of years before the British decided to colonize the planet and hand it out as candy to whom they deemed fit. Its so simple to understand with Darfur and Rwanda but with Israel its complicated?

Why the double standard?
 
 
 
. The law of Islam forbids land that was once ruled by Islam to be ruled by kufar and that is the reality of the Israeli-Arab conflict.

 

The Islamic law says many things and they have applications for any case.It's up to the interpretations.Otherwise Southern Spain,Crimeea and the Balkans would be in the same situations as Israel.There may be in a future,but right now no Islamic country has the strength to claim anything.It's about realpolitik,not whatever gibberish passage from Quran(or any other Holy Book,for that matter).

Like I said to BR a while back,I'm completely neutral in this conflict.Neutral in the sense that if the Israeli or the Palestinians will vanish tomorrow nothing will change for me,for better or worse.That being said,I understand that your mindset is a war mindset.Fine with me.But since you are at war you,the Israelis also tend to do your cause a great disservice by not understanding the nature of both the conflict and of your opponent.You are not in 1948 or even in 1967 and no Islamic country can throw you into the sea by force(we're not talking Iranian nukes,since they're not the issue here).Yet you continue to claim that the Palestinians (we'll use this term for convenience) are an existential threat.Meanwhile you choose to ignore both the sensibilities and the wider strategic interests of both the Western Europe and US.You're trying your best to grab defeat from the jaws of victory in the image war with the Palestinians.Your approach lacks any subtetly and even if what you say is true,you forgot that truth doesn't matter,perception is everything.By ignoring this you allow your enemies to drive a wedge between you and those that guaranteed your nation survival in the past.If you fail to see the long term risks of that,you're free to do so.

You could give the Palestinians anything they want and more.You could turn this into your greatest propaganda victory and make sure everyone in any English pub or French boutique understands what you have done and your terms.If you achieve this you will also turn any future hostile action by your enemies against the perpetrators.
 
 
Are you forgetting the Madrid bombing, the Chechnya Separatists, the Kosovo Liberation Army? The fact of the matter is that every inch of soil that a Muslim has put foot on has seen the blood of innocents taken by terrorists.

What you misunderstand (mainly due to my lack of inclusion) is that I desire peace. Not a day goes by that I wish we could live side by side with people who wish us well as we wish them well. I have seen it happen with my own eyes in South Africa and its a beautiful thing. The problem is that both sides need to want it. The difference between Nelson Mandela and Yassir Arafat is that Mandela used progress for peace while Arafat and his successors used progress to claim victory against the enemy.

How much does the world expect us to give before they realize that land for peace does not work? Rabin and Barak both offered to give vast amounts of land to the Palestinians in exchange for peace. Barak offered an initial 73% of the disputed territory, eventually leading to 95% of the West Bank being handed over - all we wanted in exchange was peace and the Jewish quarter of the old city of Jerusalem. The Palestinians rejected the deal.

We unilaterally left Gaza and instead of getting peace, we got a terrorist uprising and thousands of rockets fired into Israel. When is enough enough and how much do we actually have to sacrifice before the rest of the world wakes up? I am sorry but your point of view is fantastic on paper but it is not applied in reality. The world holds Israel to a different standard and this is unacceptable.

The Palestinians are not an existential threat because they are here, they are an existential threat because their entire ideology is based on gaining land and power to slowly uproot and eradicate the Jewish state. Hamas, a terrorist organization that was democratically elected by the people in 2006, openly refuses to recognize Israel's right to exist and calls for her destruction in their charter:

""Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it, just as it obliterated others before it." (The Martyr, Imam Hassan al-Banna, of blessed memory)."

The fact that you say that the truth doesn't matter sums up the entire conflict. The facts are irrelevant, the world thinks Israel is in the wrong and nothing that we do or say will change that. When we cease to exist, that's when the world will shrug and go "oops, maybe they had a point"
 
 
 
Who is the real Jew? That statement is such a laugh and a half that is not funny. Both articles are exercise in hyprocies. The first article assumes that anyone of Jewish blood, ie if you or your mother was f*cked by a Jew, then you have a say in Israeli politics.

 

Now i could be wrong on this but my understanding was one becomes a Jew if the mother is a jew and not the other way around assuming the other partner isn't a jew. I was told the reason for this is in historical times when Israel fell the women were taken as slaves and this way the people would not die out.

The same friend who told me this also narrated another story when he was in the IDF, its kinda the opposite of what Ben posted. He said when American Jews came over to serve in Israel they were all gung ho and wanted to kick some Pal-Ass. In many ways there were even more radical than those that had grown up in Israel.

So there's two kinds of American Jews isn't there. I'm guessing these would be the real 'holier than thou' variety  
 
 
Actually as far as I know, the Jewish descent used to be patriarchal but was changed somewhere along the way. There is no doubt that you get all types of Jews but the initial response to the article was that of the growing hypocrisy of Jews who consider themselves Zionists yet criticize the Israel government for building in the settlements.
 
 
1. Mate,I don't know about the ''inclusion'' and the triumph of ''diversity'' and ''the rainbow nation'' in South Africa  ,but the Afrikaners lost more people during 16years of ''peace'' than Israel lost during 60 years of war.

2.Your response is what I expected,frankly and it shows the lack of flexibility I'm accusing your country.My point was the national strategy equivalent of stepping back to better prepare your jump.I know about those percents,etc...,but I also did not heard a word about a national strategy to change the world public opinion.You know very well that no matter what you give up at the negociations table you'll still have a country and an army.And nobody could ever force you to ''integrate'' like it happened in SA.You know damn well that if you mobilize tonight you'll be in Cairo and Damascus in 10 days,nevermind Ramallah or Gaza,so your point about ceasing to exist due to Arab actions is a bit disingenous,IMO.They may have whatever ideology they want,you'll have the ability to defeat them in battle and wipe them out.

3. We could talk about the double standard till next month,but it's a reality and is a factor in the conflict.Complaining about it doesn't help your cause.Don't like it,start responding to the propaganda campaign.Start influencing the academics,the journos and the common folk,particularly those on the right side of the spectrum in the Western nations,the only nations that can offer you support if your existence will be truly at risk.

I'm not asking you to commit suicide,to leave the country you build or anything like that.Our positions are in a way resembling the positions of the Ramatkal vs the Prime Minister in the eve of the Yom Kippur war.I say let them strike in a way that is guaranteed to bring your allies to act on your side.Even if they score a minor victory,you'll score the bigger one in the long term.
 
 
And I am entirely in agreement with you.

I did a degree in communications and we had several high profile Israeli officials come talk to us. I ripped each one of them a new arsehole about the fact that our PR is up to shit, we don't have a unified message and despite our military prowess, when it comes to the media war, the Arabs beat us all ends up.

Just look at the news - you will see dead women and children on the Arab side and pictures of holes in the ground and tanks on our side. When the flotilla incident occurred last year, the Information Minister was touring Canada with his phone off and a Hebrew vm message.

I cannot agree more that our propaganda machine needs work. However, the fact that we have a great military is necessitated by the fact that if we didn't that existential threat would be looming. So saying that there is no existential threat because we have a great military is like saying there is no risk of fire because we have fire extinguishers. Its a completely moot point.
 
 
Every nation that doesn't have an army faces an existential threat(we may exclude countries like Iceland).The only thing particular to the Israeli case is that the degree of risk is indeed higher than most others.Yet it remains your national decision if it's enough to ensure your perpetual survival in the absence of foreign partners.You cannot rely 100% on either foreigners,nor own forces in this world we face today,yet you seem to be inclined more heavily to the latter.To an unhealthy degree,IMHO,but it's not my mission to decide in others business.
 
 
adam,

 
Any Jew that is not a convert or descendant of a convert necessarily has a hereditary line that traces back to those who dwelled on the land.
 

i'm not confusing the issue at all. recall that the invitation for jews to come to israel did not say "if it can be proven that your hereditary origins came from jews in the holy land". moreover, in the case of the ethiopian, german, and russian jews i used as an example above, the palestinians are most certainly genetically closer to the original jewish inhabitants than the immigrants listed above.

 
Again, if a group of Mexicans declared themselves as Native American nationalists, would that give them a right to call the United States the occupied North American territories?
 

they have the right to call themselves anything they like, and in fact, there is quite a vocal subset whom do voice that. we don't pretend that such a thing doesn't exist.

but whether or not that thinking reflects reality is another thing altogether. that depends on what national power (a part of which is military) they can wield.

in short, i'm not saying that you or israelis in general cannot oppose palestinian nationalism; i just deny that you have the power to will away national consciousness on part of others. whom are you to tell other people what their core identity is?
 
 
 
@ Zraver - My reference to Kapos is to emphasize that while Jews who turn their backs on Israel today have 100% free choice to do so, Kapos were ordered to do many vile things in order to save their own lives. If Kapos have such a bad reputation in Jewish culture, why should these people be any different when they actively seek to deligitimize and harm their brothers.

 

He starts from the premise that anyone who dissagrees with him is seeking to deligitimize Israel. I don;t think the facts support this. using terms like Kapo and traitor make discussion difficult since it strips the other side of legitmacy via a strawman proxy.

 
@Zraver - How can the settlements be on land that belongs to the PA when the land was captured in War and consequent truces were made. Go look into the Armistice agreement between Jordan and Israel. Furthermore, take a look at the 6-Day War, despite the fact that we won the land in war, we offered it back in exchange for peace. Egypt ultimately signed a ceasefire and got Sinai back, we're still waiting to hear from Syria and 40 years later, I would say the deal is off the table.
 

Israel did not eject the population at that time. They left the Palestinians there and de facto ceeded it to them when they decided to hold talks with the PLA vice PA. What we have now are micro invasions where Israel is taking the land a chunck at a time in ways that meet the legal defintion of genocide. The Palestinians have been carved up, isolated and impoverished. The best farm land is gone, water is scarce and economic prospects are about nil.

Israel is engaged in a policy that actively breeds hopelessness among the Palestinians and thus encourages conflict. The rise of Hamas is at least in part a reaction to two Israeli polices- economic blockade and a failure to work diligently to build up robust civil institutions.

If Israel has a right to exist in Israel based on ancenstral claims, then so do the Palestinians. You cannot serpate the two and claim legitmacy for one side and not the other. That works both ways. Why does a Palestinian born in the West Bank or Gaza have less right to land and water than a brand new arrival from Africa?

zraver, I would love to know where you get your information from because it is slightly removed from reality. Israel did not eject anybody because the Arabs had already instructed their brethren to leave while the bombarded us. The fact that Israel won both the 48 and 67 wars is incredible and what should have been a simple sweep for the Arabs turned into a "nakba".

I think it is highly irresponsible to throw the word genocide around. That comment is completely baseless and exposes your views as being overly judgmental while completely disregarding the facts. There are currently 14 Arab members of parliament, street signs and other informational signs are required to be in Arabic, there are mosques spread across the country and Israeli-Arabs flock to the malls, cinemas and beaches on a daily basis. Find me one Arab country where a Jew has a prominent position in government.

I reiterate, the settlements are being built upon land which is either owned by Israel or not owned by anyone at all since Jordan relinquished its hold of the West Bank. If the Palestinians were to agree to a peace deal that benefited both sides, they would receive that land to build a nation. There has not been any Palestinian leader to date who has been willing to make the right choices to move forward. Take a look at every round of negotiations we have had. Israel comes in and listens, PA comes in and demands. In a negotiation there is an element of give and take on both sides.

In terms of land and water, you are in error yet again. Israel is located in a desert, one which despite its lack of resources has been transformed into an oasis by hard-working Israelis. The entire region is facing a water crisis, we are rationed according to number of people per household. When Israel left Gaza it was teeming with farms, orchards and infrastructure which was subsequently destroyed by the people of Gaza in an act of pure stupidity and wanton destruction.

You keep saying that Palestinians have an ancestral claim to the land but can you find evidence pre1948 that shows any indication of such a people ever existing in the region?

Again the world holds Israel to a different standard. All of these expectations from the Jews to give up everything while the Arabs have shown no indication of wanting to coexist. Had the ceding of Gaza resulted in a peaceful coexistence, the argument might be different but the facts are the facts whether you like them or not.
 
 
 
And I am entirely in agreement with you.

How would you influence the western news channels though ?

The gaza flottilla incident is a case in point. I heard what BBC & CNN said and then came here to read what Ben had to say and then interpolate in between to determine the objective reality.

The term 'running a blockade' is all that i needed to understand what really happened and the aftermath. But all i heard & read in the media was ONLY about the aftermath. I think this is the general pattern, what you do in response gets more airtime than what happened prior to make you do it. There is only talk about 'effect' and very little about 'cause'. Of course in this case you will find more opinion stacked up against you.

I do as well/

 
That comment is completely baseless and exposes your views as being overly judgmental while completely disregarding the facts.
 

 The international legal definition of genocide - Prevent Genocide International 

We will use that description of genocide under international law as the rubric.

Deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to destroy a group includes the deliberate deprivation of resources needed for the group’s physical survival, such as clean water, food, clothing, shelter or medical services. Deprivation of the means to sustain life can be imposed through confiscation of harvests, blockade of foodstuffs, detention in camps, forcible relocation or expulsion into deserts.

Israel as the superior authority has certain obligations. Israel has seized farm land, does allot water via a biased scheme, does blockade foodstuffs and basic items, has targeted red crescent ambulances and denied Palestiniasn entry for life savign medical procideures. The Israeli onl roads have forced many Palestinian communites into isoaltion that can only honestly be described as camps. Israle has also acted to prevent the establishment of robust civil institutions among the Palestinians.

 
Killing members of the group includes direct killing and actions causing death.
 

Extra judicial killings and assassinations have been committed.

 
There are currently 14 Arab members of parliament, street signs and other informational signs are required to be in Arabic, there are mosques spread across the country and Israeli-Arabs flock to the malls, cinemas and beaches on a daily basis. Find me one Arab country where a Jew has a prominent position in government.
 

completely immaterial to the discussion. I am talking about Palestinians, not Israeli Arabs or other Arabs.

 
I reiterate, the settlements are being built upon land which is either owned by Israel or not owned by anyone at all since Jordan relinquished its hold of the West Bank.
 

A change of government does not invalidate property deeds or allow the displacement of people already occupying or utlizing the land.

 
If the Palestinians were to agree to a peace deal that benefited both sides, they would receive that land to build a nation. There has not been any Palestinian leader to date who has been willing to make the right choices to move forward. Take a look at every round of negotiations we have had.

Israel's recent policies WRT the settlements are a very effective and deliberate block to peace. Israel does not come in and listen, they come in with bulldozers and settlers.

 
In terms of land and water, you are in error yet again. Israel is located in a desert, one which despite its lack of resources has been transformed into an oasis by hard-working Israelis. The entire region is facing a water crisis, we are rationed according to number of people per household. When Israel left Gaza it was teeming with farms, orchards and infrastructure which was subsequently destroyed by the people of Gaza in an act of pure stupidity and wanton destruction.
 

The PA claims the average water allotment is about 70 liters a day well shy of the 100 liters per day the WHO advises. This compares to 350 liters per day per settler. Thats from the Jersualem Post.

 HRW critique that doesn 

 
You keep saying that Palestinians have an ancestral claim to the land but can you find evidence pre1948 that shows any indication of such a people ever existing in the region?
 

Absolutely, We can trace the Samaritan people back to at least the writing of the Talmud. Likewise genetic tests that proved modern jews do have ancestral links to the levant also proved kinship with the many of those now called Palestinians- the result of conversion to Hellenism, Christianity and Islam. Finally we have Ottoman and British census records.

 
Again the world holds Israel to a different standard. All of these expectations from the Jews to give up everything while the Arabs have shown no indication of wanting to coexist. Had the ceding of Gaza resulted in a peaceful coexistence, the argument might be different but the facts are the facts whether you like them or not.
 

All I expect of Israel is to obey international law and to remember that the best way for the Jews to be the "Light of Mankind" is to lead by example. The God of Moses set up the Jubliee and made the land owners make circles through square feilds to provide for the poor irregardless of religion. The Jews, African Americans, ad other oppressed groups are the very best defense the world has against a repeat. But when one of those groups adopts the model of oppressor we are all left wanting. I've gone out of my way to make sure I got to listen to a Holocaust survivor speak. She knew first hand what dehumanizing does. would you call her a Kapo?

Nesse Godin

As you know I was a prisoner from the age of 13 to 17. I lived through a ghetto, concentration camp, four labor camps and a death march. I was not strong, I was not smart, I was a little girl. I think that I survived the Holocaust by the grace of the Lord above and by the kindness of Jewish women that gave me a bite of bread, wrapped my body in straw to keep me warm, held me up when I was hurt by the guards, gave me hope, but also asked me to promise them that if I survived I would not let them be forgotten. Remember and tell the world what hatred can do. I feel that the USHMM is fulfilling my promise that I made to those women that did not survive. I am proud to be a devoted volunteer in our most wonderful institution of education as I call our USHMM.

Your arguments may work in an enviroment that does not prize discourse, but it won't fly here. I wish Israel peace and prosperity, but I wish the same for the Palestinians

Well ultimately, you have to fight fire with fire. I think Israel are completely stupid for not embedding journalists. There should be cameras present in every operation to get the live footage from our side. We need better English speakers who focus on the human side of issues. When Arabs show women and children covered in blood and we show tanks and soldiers, its a no-brainer that pathos will win.

There should have been a press conference before the flotilla incident speaking about Israel's rights with regard to Maritime law. We also should have waited for the ship to be in Israeli waters. It was a mess but a good PR machine could have lessened the damage. This is why I am working on launching a PR website for Israel that will deal with the holes in our game-plan by exposing the facts regarding issues.
 
 
Let's say that media is not the white clad knight riding to save the innocents.They can be bought,forced,manipulated,influenced to present a picture.What can be done can be also undone.
 
 
 
If the people left, where did the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza come from?

 

The region did not have a separate existence until 1948–1949, when it was conquered by Jordan's Arab Legion. The name "West Bank" is a translation of the Arabic term ad-difa’a al-gharbiya coined by the Jordanians. Until that point, the names Judea and Samaria were the English names of these regions.

Basically, the Palestinian people are Arabs from the Levant who got lost in the shuffle when the Arabs refused to agree to UN Resolution 181. Today the word Palestinian refers to something very different than an Arab resident of the mandate of Palestine. If the Arabs left their homes at the order of an Arab authority, surely it is the Arabs' responsibility to ensure that they are taken care of and given freedom to live as equal citizens in Arab states.

Except for Jordan, ironically, Israel is the only middle eastern country where Palestinians have citizenship and enjoy full civic rights. This coupled with the fact that a majority of Israeli Arabs consider themselves to be Palestinian means that of all the countries in the Middle East, Israel treats the Palestinians most humanely.

Considering that the Palestinians are descendants of Levant Arabs, the Palestinian problem should be a joint responsibility for Israel, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. This does not seem to be the case when it comes to world opinion. Palestinians are refugees in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Israel - they refuse to accept citizenship when granted and so create a problem for themselves.

 
We will use that description of genocide under international law as the rubric.

Deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to destroy a group includes the deliberate deprivation of resources needed for the group’s physical survival, such as clean water, food, clothing, shelter or medical services. Deprivation of the means to sustain life can be imposed through confiscation of harvests, blockade of foodstuffs, detention in camps, forcible relocation or expulsion into deserts.

Israel as the superior authority has certain obligations. Israel has seized farm land, does allot water via a biased scheme, does blockade foodstuffs and basic items, has targeted red crescent ambulances and denied Palestiniasn entry for life savign medical procideures. The Israeli onl roads have forced many Palestinian communites into isoaltion that can only honestly be described as camps. Israle has also acted to prevent the establishment of robust civil institutions among the Palestinians.

Extra judicial killings and assassinations have been committed.

[QUOTE=zraver;778009]completely immaterial to the discussion. I am talking about Palestinians, not Israeli Arabs or other Arabs.

Absolutely material to the discussion when a majority of these Arabs identify themselves as Palestinian. In fact, two prominent MKs, Ahmad Tibi and Haneen Zoabi identify themselves as Palestinian.

 
Your arguments may work in an enviroment that does not prize discourse, but it won't fly here. I wish Israel peace and prosperity, but I wish the same for the Palestinians

 

Discourse works both ways my friend, when the facts are presented to you, it does not help to try and refute them with pointless rhetoric about Holocaust survivors. You wish Israel and the Palestinians peace and that is wonderful, but do you honestly think that the Arab nations feel the same way? Money talks, bullshit walks - With all of their power, their resources and their money, not one Arab nation can treat the Palestinians like human beings. They also refuse to recognize Israel while violating human rights on a daily basis. Its very easy to point a finger at Israel but that light unto the nations crap does not excuse the fact that the Palestinian issue is a world issue and not just Israel's.

As I mentioned in my original piece, please come to Israel, stay in Sderot while the rockets are falling and then tell me that we have partners for peace.

And until 1948 it was not known as Israel either. Arguing over names is pedantic, we are talking about millions of people who live in the West Bank and Gaza who are slowly but surely being robbed of their land and future.

No, they did not leave or the West Bank and Gaza would be empty.

Palestinians do not have full civil rights. Even Israeli Arabs do not enjoy full rights.

Israel is the power holding the West Bank and Gaza and so it falls to Israel under international law. Israel admitted it is an occupying power when it declared a blockade of Gaza.

My comments are not heresay, if the hints provided by the reference to the Samaritans, genetic testing and water issues did not clue you in, your not nearly as smart as Ben gave you credit for. I am well versed on the issues.

For now before I go down the list point by point.

I provided an admission by the Jerusalem Post on the water issues. You ignored it and then accused me of heresay, you are very close to trolling.

You need to answer the water issue. From the website you provided current deliveries are about 22,000 tons a week. This is nearly double from what it was prior to the blockade fiasco. The Gaza Strip has an estimated population of 1.6 million people not counting settlers. That means current deliveries are 72 pounds per person. This is adequate if most of the supplies are consumables. However from 2007 until the incident at sea the historic norm was closer to forty pounds per person. This as compared to the Berlin Airlift where allied forces delivered 54 pounds per person by air on what was considered a subsistence diet. This why the ICRC asserts there is chronic malnutrition in the Gaza Strip.

 
You say extrajudicial killing, I say killing terrorists.
 

earlier in your post you imply they are citizens- which is it?

 
Absolutely material to the discussion when a majority of these Arabs identify themselves as Palestinian. In fact, two prominent MKs, Ahmad Tibi and Haneen Zoabi identify themselves as Palestinian.
 

Not material, we are talking about those who enjoy the legal status as Palestinian who live in the West Bank and Gaza not Israeli Arabs.

It was not pointless, your blog post equated anyone who did not take a hard line with Kapos.

 
You wish Israel and the Palestinians peace and that is wonderful, but do you honestly think that the Arab nations feel the same way?
 

It does not matter what the Arab world thinks, Israel as a sovereign state and member of the family of nations has certain obligations irrespective of what others say or feel.

 
Money talks, bullshit walks - With all of their power, their resources and their money, not one Arab nation can treat the Palestinians like human beings. They also refuse to recognize Israel while violating human rights on a daily basis. Its very easy to point a finger at Israel but that light unto the nations crap does not excuse the fact that the Palestinian issue is a world issue and not just Israel's.
 

You don't get to brush off responsibility like that. The Arab states are not doing micro invasions to seize land to give to people who just got off a jet and who now enjoy a preferred legal status over the people living and working on the land illegally taken. land illegally taken under existing Israeli legal precedent BTW.

 
As I mentioned in my original piece, please come to Israel, stay in Sderot while the rockets are falling and then tell me that we have partners for peace.
 

To have a partner, one must be a partner. The settlements are prima facia evidence than Israel is not interested in peace other than a piece of this and a piece of that.

This is absolutely fascinating to watch, since Adam can aruge the case much better than I can, and I know that you, Zraver, definitely know what you are talking about.

I have one question though: If the settlements are the main bar to peace, how is it that until President Obama took the stage in 2009, the settlements were never seen as a requisite to negotiations? Nixon, Carter, Reagen, Bush, Clinton, Bush Jr, et al. Stopping the settlement building was never seen as the main obstacle to peace, but rather yet another thing to be negotiated.

If Israel need be forced to stop buildingjust to get an invite to the negotiation table, what are the Palestinian requisites for negotiations? Stop running arms in ambulances? Stop launching indiscriminate rockets at innocent civilians?

Obama had the supposed promise of beign AIPAC free and the settlements have now reached the level where they endanger any hope of a Palestinian state in the West Bank.

Does the PA control Hamas? How many rocket attacks from the West Bank have thier been?

The PA is obviously not pro-Israeli but they are not wagign war either. What purpose (towards a lasting peace) do the settlements serve? How important is a slice of historically (from 1973) Arab East Jerusalem, why do settler kids get pools and Palestinian kids get barely enough water to survive. The hostility of the population of the West Bank towards Israel is very understandable. The only reason I have found that makes any sense for these issues is the Knesset is filled with cowards who won;t stand up to the more extreme elements who DO WANT an Israel from the sea to the Jordan for Jews only. Your founding fathers and mothers disarmed the Irgun, but your current leaders don't even have the spine to stand up to the most religious as the violate the very core tennets of your faith.

In the West Bank Israel has the more and more recent mud on its face.

In Gaza both sides should be ashamed. Hamas needs to move from zealotry to governing for the people. The useless war and rockets are not doing anything worthwhile. Sur ethey scare the pants off israeli school kids and cost israel some money to ahrden shelters. But the cost in Palestinian lives wrecked is not worth it. However Israel's responce is not proportionate- the blockade fails under international law since it only provided below subistince levels of aid to arrive. Israel also tried to play both sides of the fence- declaring and excercising sovergien rights over Gaza, denying the citizens there of citizenship and then claiming to not be an occupying power.

Target discrimination has also been spotty at best and possibly illegal. While the school strike was likely legit- the firing of WP into the courtyard of a apatment complex courtyard was not. Plus Hamas' election victory is Israel's fault. When the Palestinians were granted autonomy Israel gave a bunch of murdering thugs tons of moeny and weapons and then walked away. There should have been a staged and deliberate process that built up robust social instatutions, massive investment to create jobs for young men and and endless supply of loaded trucks to provide for material needs to give people a taste of what peace looked like. If someone gives a three year old a book of matches- whose fault is the resulting fire?
 
 
Let us not forget that until one side or the other gains control of Gaza, all talk of peace is an entirely moot and academic point. The PA/PLO can't control Hamas in Gaza, so a peace with the PA/PLO is irrelevant unless they regain control of Gaza. If Hamas gains control of the West Bank, their charter is no negotiations with Israel and to wipe Israel off the map. If you can convince me Israel has a partner in peace with Hamas, I'll truly be interested in seeing that happen

No its not, a real peace with the West Bank that produces a Palestinian state that can offer its people a secure future is a powerful weapon against Hamas. Also final peace talks/treaty can ban certain politcal idelogies on both sides by requring as a matter of law that the right of the other to exist is definate and not an issue.

Hence get peace now so that the politcal situation that propelled Hamas cannot be duplicated. If that fails and Hamas takes over you at least had some peace which is a PR benefit at the minimum.

My idea- ask the UNSCR (minus the US), BRIC, G8 and EU member states indiviaully what they think a real peace looks like. Use the responces to create a matrix- more overlap- do it unilaterally and the more they overlap without being universal be the more ready to give durign peace talks. Take the plan to Suadia Arabia, Egypt and Turkey- get them to sign off on it with the promise from them that a final peace treaty beign signed includes them signing as signatories recognizing Israel as a nation-state at the same time they do so for the West Bank. Then take this internationally vetted and supported plan to the West Bank and sell it- sell it hard. First with the unilateral moves- you know what the world demands so just do it. Once the Palestinians sign on- and after they make thier unilateral moves the international community demands- talk to them as equals.
 
 
Z, your entire premise suggests that instead of a two-state solution that no one really wants (since it's not feasible) the new peace treaty should be a three state solution. Israel and the West Bank, and then eventually hope that Gaza buys into the deal.

A big IF, if you ask me.

And what happens if Gaza does buy into the deal? How do you propose meshing the West bank and Gaza into the aforementioned unfeasible solution?

Here's another question: Does Israel's unilateral withdrawal in 2005 count towards anything, or is that water under the bridge and even though Israel has already taken steps, both sides start from zero? At what hypothetical point do you see Israel not being the only party making unilateral moves and slowly bleeding itself dry to appease someone that doesn't want to be appeased?

Ah, now i see the consistency of your 'shaping' ideas from India/Pakistan to Israel/Palestine  

See, the way you phrase it makes me suspect the concerned players are not interested in peace in the first place. That there are too many vested interests in the status quo. After all the situation has endured for so long now and its shaped the reality of things around. Literally your ideas are poison to hardliners of both sides. Harder they push against them worse them come out or look. These parties are putting their own selfish narrow agendas ahead of the nation they're supposed to serve.

That whenever there are 'peace talks' its just a charade, that there is no real expectation of results from both sides. The only bankable result is their failure, saving face and then both parties can return to their people and say they tried but the other side was unwilling to compromise. And both can get back to doing what they do best  

Is that too cynical a way to look at it ?

Make peace with the West Bank, small states can do well. Gaza will sort it self out WRT to that peace in time.

 
And what happens if Gaza does buy into the deal? How do you propose meshing the West Bank and Gaza into the aforementioned unfeasible solution?
 

Slowly or not at all, 3 states is probalby prefferable at this point. Hamas has been in power long enough to imprint increased religious fundamentalism in Gaza.

 
Here's another question: Does Israel's unilateral withdrawal in 2005 count towards anything,
 

No, it did then but the shelf life has expired.

 
or is that water under the bridge and even though Israel has already taken steps, both sides start from zero? At what hypothetical point do you see Israel not being the only party making unilateral moves and slowly bleeding itself dry to appease someone that doesn't want to be appeased?
 

All sides start from zero. The reason I suggested such a wide intenrational group to create the matrix is that it creates less chance that minor issues get traced as a must and identifies those issues the international community sees as a must. Israle can then see what the IR community demands and would like. Then with international support go to the leading Islamic powers willing to talk to you and offer them what you already know the world expects in trade for thier support and recognition when a final peace is signed. Then with IR and Arab support make the unilateral moves you know have to be made eventually anyway and offer up the rest of the identified points including those IR identified demands that apply to the Palestinians. Let them know real talks start when the Palestinians reciprocate with the requiredunilateral moves. If they refuse all you have lost s the stuff the world is not going to let you keep anyway and you've kicked the legs out from under the Palestinians.

Also use soft power via media and other means to sell the IR/Arab backed peace plan. Talk about young men starting familes they can return after a hard days work and smile as thier kids eat good meals and thier wife is talking about future grand babies. Talk about joint efforts to insure quality ater for all on a true per captia basis, joint education ventures, trade deals, economic aid etc. Point to all those fancy abandoned and repaired settlements and thier value as gifts to the Palestinian people. Highlight the struggles and possible bloodshed against the hard right Israelis. Portray it as Jews fighting back against the people who corrupted Zionism.

Long term the West Bank can only directly trade with Jordan and Israel- who has the ports? As West Bank prosperity increases guess what the birth rate does? That helps fight that long term bomb. Also the more successful the West bank the less viable Hamas is, extemism finds little root in soil planted with hope and employment.

No thats real politik. One side or the other needs transformative leader willing to take the first step. Remember- the PA can create the same matix and act first. Its the same with any two party standoff- the entrenched postions ar eonly entrenched until someone changes the rules of the game.
 
 
Personally I find your idea of a three-state solution interesting, if not very viable, but interesting, nonetheless. I'm gonna try and float it past some of the folks learning poli-sci and Middle Eastern studies at Uni, see what they think about it.

If you would present in the context I provided- using soft power, shaping and intitiative to achieve what Israel really needs and wants- secure borders with neighbors who have embassies to Israel in Jerusalem. That is the core of the issue for Israel and is why the Sinai was given back and the Golan is on the table. If those two strategic areas can be given up then a non-ancient judaic part of Jeruslame and some small patches of land along the Jordan River and Med coast are nothing.
 
 
Speaking of core issues- what is the core issue for the West Bank? The obvious answer is securing the continued power of the PA. However this is actually only part of it. The real core issue is future prosperity and hope for its residents. This is why selling is so important- enlist the Palestinian people to support the cause. Not directly, but indirectly by getting them to dare to dream. When they turn on the radio they hear about piles of investment money set aside by rich arabs for development, joint ventures by Israel and Microsoft to set up a chip production plant, billboards showing Palestinian farmers, home owners, and kids standing under an Image of Ishmael who is hand in hand with Issac both with Abraham behind them with a banner- one family. make them stop and wait while a joint Israeli-Palestinian ambulance rushes an expectant mother to a hospital or an emergency C section.... No force on earth can stop an inspired people. Once the Palestinian people begin speaking about local issues- jobs, homes, water, hope etc and pointing out that its all there waiting to be had- the PA will fall in line in order to preserve its power. Political positions are never absolute when it comes to staying in power.
 
 
BR,

 
Personally I find your idea of a three-state solution interesting, if not very viable, but interesting, nonetheless.
 

i don't think anyone would advertise it as a three-state solution. PA and hamas wouldn't accept either's legitimacy. at best, it's a two-state solution with gaza unaccounted for.

So, coming back to the topic question of who a real Jew is or who a real Palestinian is or who a real <insert whatever nationality> is...

The answer is one that keeps an eye on long term interests, stabilty & prosperity of their nation. Not the ones that only look at short term gains that inevitably worsen and even diminish the long term gain.

If you support the hardliners you are not a real 'anybody', you're just getting off on emotions, you think you're doing your bit but you're just being played by a narrow manipulative few with more to gain in the short term than yourself. Forget the long term, you'll be screwed and they'll be long gone.

In these particular contexts, whenever talks fail that's a sure sign to demand more from our leaders or blame them instead of blaming the other side. If both leaders of opposing sides feel the pressure to deliver instead of just going through the motions, real and enduring results are indeed possible.
 
 
 
BR,

Thats how I read it. If the PA could control Gaza it would be doing so. making any deal on the West Bank contingent on events in Gaza gives hamas a veto for as long as they are in power. Settle the West Bank, quarantine Gaza & let Gazans see & hear all about a more peaceful & prosperous life under the PA. That won't dislodge Hamas all by itself, but it will weaken them.

To have a partner, one must be a partner. The settlements are prima facia evidence than Israel is not interested in peace other than a piece of this and a piece of that.

 

I apologize for delay in my response, I have been quite ill the last few days.

I think this is the last post I am going to have on this subject, at least in conversation with you zraver as you have clearly that this is just another web forum where the facts and intelligent discussion are replaced with internet arguments. I can assure you I am not trolling at all. The fact that you have chosen to ignore all of my clear cut factual points only to produce counter-arguments from news-media assures me that your view of reality is based on your couch with a newspaper/remote control.

Quoting Jpost to a right-wing Israeli is the equivalent of quoting Fox News to a liberal American. It might look pretty but its warped on focused on profit, nothing else. In general, I would advise you not to believe everything you see or read in the news - see Wikileaks for more info.

My answer to your jpost article is simple: Israel has no more responsibility to the people in West Bank and Gaza than the 21 Arab nations that promote the Palestinian Struggle as part of their daily anti-Semitic hate speech. We have a water crisis in Israel, we are doing our best to alleviate the situation but that does not mean that I as a tax payer should have equal availability to water as a person who pays no taxes and burns Israeli flags.

Israel does more for the Palestinians and Israeli Arabs (THE MAJORITY OF WHOM CONSIDER THEMSELVES PALESTINIAN!) than any other country in this world. Not only do we provide as best as we can, short of destroying our own economy, but we grant citizenship to refugees from Ethiopia, Darfur, Eritrea etc. Israel is always one of the first countries to respond to international crises. We provide field hospitals and search and rescue missions and we are met with conspiracy theories about organ harvesting and blood libels.

With all due respect my friend, I do not need you to preach to me about what is right and wrong in this world. Israel is in a crap situation and we can only do the best that we can do. We do not have the natural resources (land, fertile soil, oil, gold, etc.), we do not have friendly borders and we sure as hell do not have the luxury of freedom within our own state without the fear of dreadful attacks.

Despite all of this, we remain focused on seeing out this situation, despite Samir Khuntar, despite Balck September, Hamas, Hizbalah, Iran and every other Muslim faction that threatens us with eventual destruction on a daily basis. However, we will not sit with our hands behind our backs while rockets are shot into our territory by a terrorist group that took over the land we gave to the Palestinians in an effort to get to peace. Of course in your eyes, that wasn't good enough but please find me one real sacrifice a Palestinian/Jordanian/Syrian/Lebanese government has made to ensure lasting peace in the region. Not during war, not because of international pressure, a pure attempt to do everything in their power for peace. Good luck.

Your idea for a 3 state solution might sound glorious but it makes little sense and is completely impractical. You might also find that two states already exist, one is called Israel, the other is called Jordan. That's what was decided by the mighty British Empire and since they "owned" the land back then, maybe the Arabs should have listened. But of course when it comes to Islam, everyone is a little less strict, less they get Jihad in their back yard. Its wonderful to sit and point fingers at Israel when her "partners for peace" are some of the most brutal, inhumane people on this planet -  YouTube - Hamas terrorists kill innocent Palestinian in Gaza (Rare Video) (Must See) 

In any other society, honor killings, female circumcision, suicide bombing, slavery are absolutely unacceptable but the Arabs/Muslims can do whatever they want. There is no accountability for Arabs while there is amplified accountability for Israelis. This is a double standard that is completely and utterly unacceptable. You can bring me all of the articles you want from the corrupt HRW, Betselem etc. the point is this: Until we have equal partners who are treated equally by the world and are scrutinized equally for their actions and inactions, until we have partners who value the flourishing of their people over the destruction of ours we will NEVER have peace in the region. I am sorry but this is the reality of the situation and if you can't accept it, you are better off continuing to read the nonsense spouted by the liberal news media in order to get your money.

And one more thing - Israel may have not been called Israel in 1948 but the "land of Israel" as it was called in Hebrew has existed since the first book of Genesis. The name Israel or variations of it have been found in languages that are now extinct. The name Palestine also originates from Hebrew and was used before Arabic or Islam even existed, this is not opinion it is fact. It is also fact that the Israelites living in the land were exiled several times throughout history allowing for others to come in and take what belongs to the Jews. Despite all of this and despite the perils that the Jews faced through thousands of years to get back to their own home country, a majority of people here would happily give up parts of it in order to live in peace. Unfortunately, this is an unattainable goal since every time we have given land for peace, we have been burned. The following 22 UN member states do not recognize Israel as a state: Afghanistan, Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Brunei, Chad, Cuba, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Malaysia, North Korea, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, United Arab Emirates and Yemen. Notice a trend? Furthermore, both the PA and Hamas will not recognize Israel as a sovereign state so please explain to me, if we don't exist, who the hell are they supposed to negotiate with.

I find it quite sad that people of intelligence can be confounded by the mis-truths, lies and propaganda that exists in this world. Just remember Hitler's "Big Lie" theory (Worded wonderfully by Richard Belzer: "If you tell a lie that's big enough, and you tell it often enough, people will believe you are telling the truth, even when what you are saying is total crap."
 
 
OK Adam, you've made your speech, I have a few questions:

1) What is your solution to the current situation? In Adamworld what happens to the West Bank & Gaza & the people living there?

2) In the blog piece that brought you here you made it clear that diasporan jews who disagree with your opinion are 'worse than kapos'. Does that apply to supporters of the 'Olmert Plan'?

3) If diasporan Jews you disagree with are 'worse than Kapos', what about gentiles? What is the appropriate term?

3) If diasporan Jews you disagree with are 'worse than Kapos', what about gentiles? What is the appropriate term?

 

1)My perfect world depends on how many years back we go. If its 1948, we stick with the original plan. Jews get their own state, Arabs get their own state, each respects each other and there is no need for countless lives lost.

Given the situation we have today, if we choose not to go back and change anything. All Arab nations must immediately recognize the state of Israel, outlaw antiSemitic propaganda (like in Germany) and work towards achieving normalized ties with Israel. Gaza should be established as the first stronghold for the dispersed people. Arab nations should have monitors in the area to ensure that there is no chance of terrorist organizations seizing power. Egypt should open her borders fully and allow aid in. Once this happens and it can be seen that it is sustainable, Israeli could open trade routes and move towards a similar model in the West Bank.

In regards to your second question. Nowhere in my blog did I write that "diasporan jews who disagree with your opinion are 'worse than kapos'". I did however say that American Jews who call themselves Zionists, benefit from free trips to Israel on programs such as Nefesh b Nefesh and the like and claim to love Israel are hypocrites if they then turn around and bash Israeli foreign policy because its en vogue. One either supports Israel's right to exist or they do not, it cannot be both ways.

My usage of the word kapo is to contrast that while kapos were forced to turn on their people to save their own lives, these so called Zionists have no such life threatening situation - my words were taken completely out of context.

Any non-Israeli Jew who completely rejects Israel and takes the side of the Arabs may be a traitor in my eyes, but at least they have integrity and are not hypocrites.

3) I have no qualms with gentiles. In fact, I think we get more support from gentiles than we do from diaspora Jews. This is not a battle for gentiles (not on a micro-level at least) and so I don't think they owe me a damned thing. If a gentile wants to hate me or love me, that is great, I owe them nothing and vice-versa. The point made in the blog was that the Arabs have such a powerful message because as much as they might kill each other, they will never delegitimize the cause of their brothers against a common perceived enemy.

At the end of the day, my "speech" was about sticking together as a nation, like the Arabs do. If you claim to be a Zionist, act like a Zionist to the end, don;t take the best bits while trying to establish some "holier-than-thou" aura in order to appease those around you with a different opinion. And don't walk into Zionisms back yard and start preaching what it is to be a true Zionist.

Unfortunately the discussion was hijacked, as usual, and turned into "Israel bad, Arabs, poor sad lonely Arabs". When I get told I am trolling because I have a difference of opinion, that kind of thing just pisses me off. You can't have a logical discussion when the truth is immaterial to the conversation.

When I get told I am trolling because I have a difference of opinion, that kind of thing just pisses me off. You can't have a logical discussion when the truth is immaterial to the conversation.

 

You got told you were trolling because your not interested in conversation. You claim you've laid out clear cut factual points, so have I, ones that say different things from yours. Then you finish your conversation with a claim of victim hood. You go out of your way to deny the fact that the Palestinians are people who live in intolerable conditions enforced by Israel. When BF asked you what your solution is, you picked Gaza the basket case where there is no chance of success and then ignored the West Bank unless Gaza succeeds. This is strange since you like to claim the Palestinians are Jordanian- unless you want yet more land.

In fact you refuse to admit that the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza are distinct from Jordanians or Israeli Arabs as a political unit. You won't even grant them the lightest bit of humanity. You claim woe is me over rockets, what about F-16's dropping 500lb bombs on cars in crowded streets? What about firing WP rounds into apartment court yards?

You also keep trying to widen the issue- the issue is not the Arabs in Israel, or outside of Israel- it is how the Jews and Palestinians treat each other. Disgusting is about the only word for it. How can you expect something other than war when you seize land and then build settlements with swimming pools for the incoming Jews from other parts of the world while relegating the natives to water levels the WHO says are inadequate? How do you justify massive malnutrition?

More importantly, how do you justify the settlements which are in defiance of Israel's own legal tradition in dealing with property deeds and successor states. When Israel was birthed Jews and Arabs ( who stayed put) did not lose their deeds. yet Israel now takes land at will and then links them by Jewish only roads that in turn isolate the Palestinians, locking them into virtual ghettos.

Israel's policy is as racist as Hamas, pretending its not is dishonest. Thankfully, like the males reserved by God during the time of Elijah, there are Jews who see the truth and standing up the idol of Baal called Zionism. Zionism=Racism just as much ans antisemitism, both are blights on the face of humanity.

finally, your style of debate centers around ad hominems and simple dismissals- not point by point discussion. I don't know how you hoodwinked Ben, he is a good guy. Even when we disagree he is solid. Had you bothered to ask him, you would not be trying to insinuate that I am an anti-Semite. He could have directed you to my defense of Israel during the Mamarra incident, or of Israel's cassus beli in 2006 and 2007.
 
 
''One either supports Israel's right to exist or they do not, it cannot be both ways.''- Adam,this was either poor phrasing or blatant BS(no offense).I've yet to hear of any Jew wanting to destroy Israel on purpose(a few sectarians aside).Would you like to clarify how exactly those Jews and the foreign policy they support can modify the balance of power in the area.Because that's what we are talking about wrt Israel's survival.IDF vs the rest of ME armies.Simple as that.

''Zionism=Racism just as much ans antisemitism, both are blights on the face of humanity.'' -
Z,I guess you ended your argument with Adam.What's there to talk anymore.You actually told him he's a blight on the face of humanity.Let' me get this straight-for you any nationalism is racism?

p.s Finally-reason 300 of what makes one a racist.Yesss.

Well, he said our discussion was done, and then began a stream of ad hominems....

No not any nationalism, Zionism as it exists today. Zionism is not nationalism, its racism pure and simple. It might have started as a national movement, but it has moved so far from that course its not even recognizable. Israel is both a nation and a state, the original reason for zionism is gone. The Israeli hard right won't give the Palestinians even basic human rights. Look at his comment that Israel doesn't owe the Palestinians an equal share of the water. He couches it as Israeli taxpayers but the fact is Israel has just about drained the Jordan river dry. Thats not a tax payer resource, its a life issue. Every Settler brought in gets about 350-400 liters of water a day- enough for pools and water parks- even though many were not born in the land of Israel and have only nebulous links to the region. Yet he is ok with this, and if the amount of water a Palestinian gets drops to 50 liters a day he would be fine with that- if they don't like it they can leave- thats what he wants.

What is happening to the Palestinians is aparthied, Jim Crow and the Ghettos. Thats why so many Jews are starting to rebel against Zionism. Zionist are also one of two prime reasons the region is engulfed with endless war. Don't get me wrong, the palestinians are equally at fault. Both sides have decided on murder as policy. However it is the Israeli hard right that is pushing Israel to enact ever more provocations of the Palestinians. The roads and checkpoints that prevent travel, chronic malnutrition, water theft, land theft, denial of medical care, enforced unemployment, deliberately undermining the PA in the eyes of the Palestinian people... The Israeli hard right wants war every bit as much or more than Hamas.

How long has it been since a terrorist attack was carried out from the West Bank? Compare this to how long its been since a Palestinian in the West Bank was killed by Israel.
 
 
In the Israeli hard right, yes, war might be the preferable option, but I am far from the hard right, and I take some issue with your comparison of Zionism to Racism.

At it's core, Zionism is another word for Israeli Patriotism, at least as far as I'm concerned and how I see it. If someone were to say that the American Jingoism following 9/11 (absent a couple aberrations) was Racism, would you agree?

There is a very distinct line between the positive aspects of patriotism towards one's country and the negative aspects of racism of people that live in the same country. Israel is a Nation-State, with everything that accompanies that title, which includes the law that anyone that can prove they are Jewish is more than welcome to emigrate.

In this limited case I agree with Adam: The Palestinians and everyone else could have got what they wanted in 1947/48. They chose to gamble, and lost. They should not be allowed to cry do-over just because they are not happy with the results.

No but I do call Jim Crow from 1870-1970 racism. it would be fine if the emigres were settled in Israel inside of the borders she chieved following the end of the 1973 War and later treaties. I have zero problem with that, my problem is the fact that following 1973 the Gaza and West Bank were Palestinian not Jewish areas.

I have no problem with emigration, my problem is taking Palestinian land, water and hope to do it.

I am not talking about the wars, the Arabs and Palestinians chose wrong and lost. Israel epxanded via defensive wars IMO and I have no problem with that. I am talking about the West Bank and Gaza, following 1973 these areas were Palestinian. Now Israel is doing micro invasions taking more and more of the West Bank and turning the remaining parts into isolated access controlled ghettos.

That poor guy that got shot, he is only dead becuase Israel wants two different systems of justice. I remember a 10 year old boy being shot in the top of the head with a rubber bullet by the IDF several years ago. Does the PA have the legal authority to second guess Israeli's legal system and launch commando raids to retrieve the shooter for trial? The Hamas militants who were freed had been in confinement and were freed as part of legitmate diplomatic efforts. Yes they are terrorist, but they had less blood on thier hands than a single F-16 pilot who was part of the bombing of Tyre. Israel should have sat on its hands at least openly and worked to strengthen the PA. Now the Palestinians have yet another reason to choose war.
 
 
Ben,

I want to affirm to you that Israel IS a member of the family of nations and DOES have a right to exist in peace with secure borders. That Judaism is a gift to humanity with Mosaic Laws like Jubilee, requiring witnesses for rape and gleaning serving as humanitarian examples to the entire world.

However, no matter how much some want to deny it, some of those Palestinians have roots in the land going back to when it was called Caanan. All but the new born have been there longer that emigre Jews. The West Bank, Arab parts of East Jerusalem and Gaza belong to them.

I want a just peace for both peoples based on the borders established by the end of the Yom Kippur War and any relevant treaties Israel is signatory to.
 
 
 
Zionism=Racism

 

Well you have exposed how one-sided your ideology is in terms of how one looks at Israel.

I grew up in South Africa and live in Israel, I have experienced apartheid and antiSemitism and I am a Zionist. The fact that you think that all 3 are interchangeable means that you have been completely mislead by "Facts" presented to you. There is absolutely no comparison. Again, the invitation stands. COME HERE! See what the Arabs are really exposed to on a daily basis. Go look at the high class restaurants and malls in Gaza. Go see what cars their politicians drive and how the higher up members of Hamas live and tell me that we are the oppressors.

The reason this argument is pointless is that in order to have a logical argument, there needs to be a common point at which the two parties can meet and discuss their differences. Your perception of Zionism = Apartheid is so far from my perception of Palestinian = Antisemitism that we will probably never agree.
 
 
Adam,I don't doubt Arab chiefs live the good life in Gaza,Z's problem was that commoners live like sh!t.Granted I saw at TV the dumb horde tearing apart the symbols of oppression,like orchards,irrigation system or houses.Dumb herds are the same everywhere.

Thats a class system reality rebadged as a conspiracy theory. I.E The Rich are oppressing us. The Economic separation imposed upon the state Zraver mentions is real. The Class system is a result of exploiting opportunities present. Limit the opportunities and you limit the opportunities/growth. Limit the opportunities for development and you get stagnation.

Im not sure what connotations of Apartheid/Antisemitism you think are not interchangeable because you havn't specified - unless your flatly denying or refusing to consider economic realities as a basis of discontentment.

In which case, it doesn't matter if you cant agree with him, or discuss your differences - which has already been alluded to earlier.

There are obviously viewpoints in regards to Apartheid, but the outcome is always the same for those existing within systems that have enforced economic situations on people under their influence, IE Mao, North Korea, Burma, Cuba. Regardless of one likes a label or not. There being any amount of people that can see just what a shit hole what remains of Palestine is will ensure you will probably be having this argument till the day proverbial.
 
 
Yes and while Israel has a part to play in resolving the situation, we are nowhere near solely responsible for their plight or the resolution of it. I keep mentioning this double standard. If a group of Mexicans decided that they wanted Texas back because they were uprooted and removed, how far do you think they would get?

If a group of Aborigines decided they wanted Australia back, how far would they get? During Operation Cast Lead, a very similar situation was occurring in the Tamil region of Sri Lanka - The Sri Lankans went in and mowed down men, women and children in order to purge the terrorists from the region, and no outcry from the international community. Israel has an operation to neutralize rocket fire, remains as humane as possible, given the circumstances (THIS IS A WAR) and the world shits on us.

I have no issue with Z wanting to live in a perfect world where everyone can hold hands and be happy but that isn't reality and it is absolutely irresponsible to spread lies like "Israel commits genocide", "Zionism = Apartheid" or insinuating that Israel's use of WP is in any way illegal. Not once in his entire character assassination of the country did he ever place any onus on the Arab Nations, Hamas or the Palestinian people. Its all Israel's fault, there is no room for argument. That's BS!

No there are two separate issues, one is Zionism, the other is security. Two make them into the same ideal is irresponsible. Nobody ever said that other races or religions were unwelcome in Israel but the country was established on a certain founding principle: "This is the Jewish state, you may live here in peace and have all the freedoms to do as you please but you will not usurp authority with a majority vote". Israel is not a democracy, that does not mean it is not free and it certainly does not mean it is an apartheid state.

Those who choose to live here in peace receive all the benefits of doing so, those who oppose and make themselves unwelcome are very quickly shown the door. Is Australia an apartheid state for refusing to let in refugees seeking asylum? How about not allowing refugees access to their court systems?

On a security front, we have sworn enemies who call for our destruction on a daily basis. They have proven time and again that, given the opportunity, they will attack and kill our civilians. Thus we have a need for a strong military presence because unlike the U.S. that is fighting wars far away from their people, we are fighting in our own back yard and we really feel the terrorist threat on a daily basis. Your bogeyman is our reality.

Despite this fact, Israel still maintains one of, if not the most moral and ethical army in the world. We provide our enemy with intelligence that has a direct impact on the success of our operations in order to protect their civilians - this despite the fact that Geneva Convention holds Hamas responsible for any Palestinian causalities in the conflict. We try our best to make our strikes as pin-point accurate as possible so that civilians will not be harmed, this despite the fact that those civilians should not be anywhere near the militarized zones to begin with.

We are in a situation where the wool has been pulled over the eyes of the world and the international community is convinced that Israel are the bad guys. There is no outcry against Hamas, Hizbalah, Izz ad-Din al-Qassamor any of the other various terrorist organizations in the region that give absolute legitimacy to Israel's military campaigns. There are no outcries against the Human Rights violations committed by these organizations on a daily basis. The blame lies squarely in Israel's hands.

I don't have time for a longer reply at the moment, but if you really believe the bit I highlighted then your thinking is even narrower than I feared.
 
 
BF: This might not be the best of indicators, but it certainly is an indicator:

Below are two Wikipedia pages, the first one of the Mavi Marmara incident where 9 civilians were killed, the second of the decimation of the Tamil Tigers, with an estimated 7,000 civilian deaths. Glaringly absent from the latter page is the section on public reaction towards the event. The Mavi Marmara incident, on the other hand, his it's own page dedicated solely to the reactions to the flotilla. A quick check will show that the page dedicated to public reaction is bigger than the page dedicated to the event itself

Being that Wikipedia is an open source, free encyclopedia written by the people, what does this say to you about the difference in public perception of the two incidents?

Ben,

In reading the first link I found this

 
Harvard Law School Professor Alan Dershowitz, Chicago Law School Professor Eric Posner, and Johns Hopkins international law Professor Ruth Wedgwood, said that the naval blockade and the boarding in international waters were in accord with long-standing international law, and comparable to other blockades in unrelated, historical conflicts.[263][264][265] Dershowitz and Posner also defended the specific use of force as legal.
 

I agree with this assessment, don't think the majority of people disagree, just some vocal individuals. I beleive that if the USN were attacked in this maner while boarding a ship, the attackers wouldn't have made it.

Whiskey, thankx for pointing out the double standard, though we beat that dead horse ad Nauseum in the thread on the Marmara incident itself. You don't think the majority of people disagree, but look at the third page, the public reactions to the incident. If you've got time, read through them, count how many times they use words like illegal, massacre, international waters, etc...

Hell, searching for "Mavi Marmara Incident" on Wikipedia won't have a direct link to the page, but "Mavi Marmara Massacre" will directly link
 
 
 
I don't have time for a longer reply at the moment, but if you really believe the bit I highlighted then your thinking is even narrower than I feared.

 

Well I would love for you to elaborate because this is more or less how I see it (as presented by the Tamil Center for Human Rights):

 http://www.tchr.net/rights_to_self_d...son_Tamils.pdf 

Please also take into consideration that this document was released in 2007, before the Sri Lankan Army decimated the Tamils and before Cast Lead.

Some highlights:

Palestine Tamils

Colonised areas About : 4800km2 8000km2

Civilians killed: Over thousand?? More than 100,000

Houses destroyed: 8500 500,000

UN H/R Special sessions: Several None

UN Resolutions: Several None

Countries in support OIC Countries: (57) None

This article describes the situation in contrast to Cast Lead:

 What the Tamils and Palestinians have in common | GlobalPost 

The last line of the first page sums it up perfectly: While nobody can decide who is the good/bad guy in Sri Lanka, Israel is already condemned to be the bad.

So is my thinking really that narrow?

I stand corrected, there were many protesters - many distorting the events, including many countries. But many others condemned the violence, which I interpreted as the initiation of violence by the people on the ship. And offered sympathy to the victims, which I interpreted to include the injured soldiers. I am in agreement with you on this, just pointing out that not all the responses are negative, there were pro-Israeli demonstrations in the US. I wonder how many of these protesters would feel if their countries and homes were rocketed.

In that page I also found
 Gaza flotilla raid - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia  -redirected from Mavi_Marmara_Massacre

 
In addition, the flotilla was found to be carrying ballistic vests, gas masks, night-vision goggles, clubs, and slingshots.[52] Two-thirds of the medicines delivered by the flotilla expired between six and fifteen months prior to the raid,[53] and were found to be useless.[54] Some other medicines found on the flotilla were due to expire soon. Additionally, Israel said that much of the cargo, including sensitive medical equipment, was found to have been scattered in the ship's holds, and put in piles rather than packed properly for transport, and consequently damaged.[43] Operating theater equipment, which was supposed to be kept sterile, was carelessly wrapped.
 

 
Two of the activists (Ali Haydar Bengi and Ibrahim Bilgen) who died during the MV Mavi Marmara clash had previously said that they wished for martydom.[78] On 29 May, Aljazeera broadcast footage of Mavi Marmara activists participating in a chant calling for battle against Jews.[78][79]

This is exactly correct.

If you compare the military operations of the Sri Lankans against the Tamil that took place almost simultaneously with Cast Lead, it turns out that the former took the lives of at least 7000 civilians, that is, a similar number to the total of dead Palestinians (combatants and civilians) since 1967 in all of their attacks and wars against Israel - and let's remember "Palestinians" didn't exist as such before 1967.

Just one point: the United Islamo-Terrorist Front...oops, sorry.... the United Nations Human Rights Council, the same UNHRC that has been busy trying to equate Cast Lead with the Mongol raids with such amusing documents as the Goldstone "report", did in fact pass a resolution to address the Sri Lankan military operations in winter-spring 2008/9: it was to PRAISE Sri Lanka.

Well you have exposed how one-sided your ideology is in terms of how one looks at Israel.

 

Yup, you have confirmed you're troll. This statement is placed directly a post where I say,

Ben,

I want to affirm to you that Israel IS a member of the family of nations and DOES have a right to exist in peace with secure borders. That Judaism is a gift to humanity with Mosaic Laws like Jubilee, requiring witnesses for rape and gleaning serving as humanitarian examples to the entire world.

I want a just peace for both peoples based on the borders established by the end of the Yom Kippur War and any relevant treaties Israel is signatory to.

So how are my views onesided with regsrd to Israel. I said Zionism= racism, not Jewishness or Israel= racism.

 
I grew up in South Africa and live in Israel, I have experienced apartheid and antiSemitism and I am a Zionist.
 

The demonstrable facts based on your own writings is you do not consider the Palestinians human. You do not recognize thir right to own peoprty, be secure in thier homes, enjoy nutritious meals or freedom from violence. How exactly do your views differ from apaprthied in practice?

 
The fact that you think that all 3 are interchangeable means that you have been completely mislead by "Facts" presented to you. There is absolutely no comparison.
 

As I predicted you have now accused me of antismeitism- this after I have professed nothing but admiration for Jewish contributions in history, humantirainism and affirmed Israel's right to exist.

 
Again, the invitation stands. COME HERE! See what the Arabs are really exposed to on a daily basis. Go look at the high class restaurants and malls in Gaza. Go see what cars their politicians drive and how the higher up members of Hamas live and tell me that we are the oppressors.
 

Once again you set up a fale standard- who contorls what supplies get in? Who has built roads and walls to isolate communities in the West Bank, who has been seizing land from average people. Who is restricting water to make sure emigres have rude plenty. It does not matter what the upper crust lives like in Gaza, compare like v like- Settlers in the West Bank veses West Bank Palestinians.

 
The reason this argument is pointless is that in order to have a logical argument, there needs to be a common point at which the two parties can meet and discuss their differences. Your perception of Zionism = Apartheid is so far from my perception of Palestinian = Antisemitism that we will probably never agree.
 

Your right, since you have equated anyone who wants the same peace, security and prosperity you want for you to also apply to the Palestinians has been labled by you as an antisemite. Never mind the fact that most Palestinian Arabs are semites, while many Jews are not....

If you want to talk logic

If racism is the beleif that two different people can be treated differently based on nothing more than race or ethnic identity.

And zionism as epxressed by you (a self admitted zionist) and other members of the Israeli right think its ok to seize land, enforce malnutrition, limit water, deny medical care, restrict travel and isolate communites of Palestinians to make it possible to epxand West Bank settlements.

Then Zionism= racism.
 
 
This ''racist'' stuff really is an obsession.   Of course he bloody demonizes them,they are his mortal foes.Whether you or I thinks he is correct in that matter is irrelevant.

Adam,I got it from your first post that you're at war.I've already expressed my views on the nature of the conflict and how it might be won by the Jewish side.Now would you mind telling how do you plan to achieve victory and how do you define that victory.

See I dissagree that they are his mortal foes, not in the West Bank at least. Enemies yes, mortal foes no. If he had to atually describe the differences between aparthied and the Jewish Ghettos compared to the West Bank he would fail, and fall back on false justifications or comparisons.

I call him and zionism racism based on a simple listing of the facts nothign more. if it was racism under Jim Crow, Ghettos, or aparthied then the same policies are racism in Palestine, Bahrain or anywhere else where the people in power exploit those not of their own kind and not in power.

He doesn't know me, or the fact I speak out agaisnt racism where ever I find it. I've done so about areas of America, in the West Bank, and in Bahrain and other gulf states. He would rather lable me an antisemite and then forget about me.
 
 
Adam, open challenge You defend Israel's policy in the West Bank from the points I bring up. We will go point by point.

Rules- no logical fallacies.
 
 
Adam, should you accept.

Point one- Israeli policy following the creation of the state of Israel in 1947 as applied to both Jews and Arabs has held that those persons who did not flee their property retained the title to it even if those deeds had been acquired in either the Ottoman or Mandate Period. The national flag was not held to effect private property ownership.

How do you justify seizing land from Palestinians in the West Bank without consent or just compensation given Israel's own established legal tradition of private property ownership as applied to both Arabs and Jews.

With all due respect, I have played this game before and all it will result in is the appearance of my struggling for credibility while you throw loaded questions at me. We have polar opposite beliefs and ideologies but we have equal standing so neither of us should be on the back-foot to answer such questions. Either way, when I have answered questions you have either ignored my responses or disregarded them by throwing rhetoric packed statements back at me.

You have accused me of trolling, being an accomplice to genocide and a racist. You have implied that I think Palestinians are sub-human and that I called you antiSemitic. I am not sure we have that kind of trust between us just yet. Maybe in time.

 
Adam,I got it from your first post that you're at war.I've already expressed my views on the nature of the conflict and how it might be won by the Jewish side.Now would you mind telling how do you plan to achieve victory and how do you define that victory.

 

Victory? No, that is a word that Islamic Terrorists use. I don't want victory, I want peace. Plain and pure peace. This can only be achieved with a partner for peace. I know that Z keeps disregarding the Gaza issue but the fact of the matter is that we have tried peace for land, it does not work. I already detailed how I think things should go down based on the current situation:

Gaza should be established as the first stronghold for the dispersed people. Arab nations should have monitors in the area to ensure that there is no chance of terrorist organizations seizing power. Egypt should open her borders fully and allow aid in. Once this happens and it can be seen that it is sustainable, Israeli could open trade routes and move towards a similar model in the West Bank.

The Palestinians have Gaza already, contrary to what some believe, they have aid flowing in and despite being ruled by a terrorist organization that refused the flotilla aid being delivered from Israel, and the fact that Egypt's blockade is similar to Israel's, we are the ones who are permanently vilified.

If Gaza were to be disarmed, a non-terrorist government elected and Israel were to be recognized - by all Arab/Muslim nations - as a sovereign state that has a right to exist and protect herself, I would consider that a great start.
 
 
 
BF: This might not be the best of indicators, but it certainly is an indicator:

 

You are right & wrong BR. Yes, it is a poor indicator, no it does not indicate that Adam was right.

I'm not going to get sidetracked into yet another 'only Israel' discourse, there are too many other issues on this thread to deal with. I responded to this statement:

 
The Sri Lankans went in and mowed down men, women and children in order to purge the terrorists from the region, and no outcry from the international community.
 

note the highlighted portion. Had you followed your wiki link to 'the end of the Sri Lankan Civil War' you would have seen that various nations & organisations did express concern. In fact, I didn't waste time reading the whole thing, as one example suffices to disprove the contention. I know from my own reading & from watching TV news at the time that not only were protests issued at the time, but there were also concerns raised about detention camps after the war. Maybe the news didn't make it to Israel, but it happened. I could waste time digging up more links, but I don't need to.

Adam made a foolishly exaggerated statement that he apparently thinks is true.

 Sri Lankan Civil War - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 

 
Well I would love for you to elaborate because this is more or less how I see it (as presented by the Tamil Center for Human Rights):

 

That this is 'more or less' how you see it was my concern. You made a statement of absoulutes that I think says more about how you conceptualize these issues than it does about what has happened. I have elaborated above. You have provided a list that doesn't even cover the events you referred to.

 
 http://www.tchr.net/rights_to_self_d...son_Tamils.pdf 

Please also take into consideration that this document was released in 2007, before the Sri Lankan Army decimated the Tamils and before Cast Lead.
 

Oh, and you used a pro-LTTE website AND reproduce questionable figures to supportyour argument. I suspect that this is the sort of thing you berate people for when they link to pro-HAMAS websites (you already dismissed one of Z's links because the website was too liberal). Simple fact checking would have revealed that 100,000 is the high end figure for ALL deaths for the ENTIRE war - that includes an estimated 50,000 combatants on both sides & Sinhalese civillians too.

 
United Nations, 07 September, (Asiantribune.com): The United Nations has admitted it made an "error" in permitting three representatives of the Tamil Centre for Human Rights (TCHR), a pro-LTTE organization, to participate in a major conference of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Paris last week
 

 UN Admits Mistake in Pro-LTTE Presence at Human Rights Meeting in Paris | Asian Tribune 

 
This article describes the situation in contrast to Cast Lead:

 What the Tamils and Palestinians have in common | GlobalPost 

The last line of the first page sums it up perfectly: While nobody can decide who is the good/bad guy in Sri Lanka, Israel is already condemned to be the bad.
 

And again you are addressing a different issue. If you wanted to point out that the two situations were treated differently then you should have said so. Instead you chose to make exaggerated claims that you still can't admit were incorrect. I'm not just nitpicking here, I think that statement was emblematic of the way you filter the world.

 
So is my thinking really that narrow?
 

Hell yes.

I've got a few more point to make tommorrow on other things you've written. I've spent enough time on this. If you don't want to be misunderstood then be clear. if you want people to give you the benefit of the doubt then don't argue so hard in support of absurd premises (such as denying Palestinians a national identity or calling other jews 'worse than Kapos').
 
 
 
Adam, should you accept.

Point one- Israeli policy following the creation of the state of Israel in 1947 as applied to both Jews and Arabs has held that those persons who did not flee their property retained the title to it even if those deeds had been acquired in either the Ottoman or Mandate Period. The national flag was not held to effect private property ownership.

How do you justify seizing land from Palestinians in the West Bank without consent or just compensation given Israel's own established legal tradition of private property ownership as applied to both Arabs and Jews.

 

Well, its called war. When nations go to war, they are gambling with their people's lives and resources. The 1948 Arab-Israeli War ended with Israel capturing territory. This led to the establishing of Armistice lines in the 1949 Armistice Agreement between Israel and the Arab Nations (Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria). Furthermore, the Tripartite declaration gave added credibility to the Armistice agreements by which the U.S., U.K. and France pledged to do all in their power to prevent violations of the agreement. So we can already see that there is an agreed upon change in territory control from 1947 to 1949.

In 1967, Israel was again at war with her neighbors, again we won and took territory. Israel offered the territory back in exchange for recognition and peace. This deal was rejected. The majority of Palestinians fled to Jordan, some remained in the territory captured by Israel and were offered citizenship which most of them declined. Egypt and Syria would later try to go to war again in 1973 and would lose again.

Ultimately, Jordan and Egypt made peace with Israel and both nations resolved territorial disputes with Israel. Since this time relations between Israel and these two nations have been beneficial to all parties involved.

It should also be noted that UN Resolution 242 was also rejected by the PLO. So your question is loaded. It automatically assumes Israel to be solely responsible for the displacement of Palestinians. This is false. Not only has Israel tried countless times to settle the issue, but all involved Arab nations and the PLO have, at one time or another, completely rejected peace treaties, UN resolutions and armistice agreements with Israel. So please explain to me how Israel is the only responsible party in this situation and why there is no pressure on the Arab party to resolve this issue.
 
 
BF: Sri Lanka claimed a propaganda victory last night after the United Nations Human Rights Council passed a resolution praising its defeat of the Tamil Tigers and condemning the rebels for using civilians as human shields.

China, India, Egypt and Cuba were among the 29 developing countries that backed a Sri Lankan-proposed resolution describing the conflict as a “domestic matter that doesn’t warrant outside interference”. The resolution also supported Colombo’s insistence on allowing aid group access to 270,000 civilians detained in camps only “as may be appropriate”.

You have quite clearly missed the entire point that I am making. You have two similar situations involving an "occupied people" and an "occupier". However the one is met with condemnation and the other is praised despite the fact that more civilians have died in the Tamil issue than in the Palestinian one.

There is a double-standard and you can choose to ignore it to suit your argument all you want, that does not make the issue disappear. Occupied land and people, military action against them, multiple thousands of dead civilians and targeted assassination of leaders. This all happened in Sri Lanka. Keep in mind I used the word OUTCRY. Expressing concern is not condemnation.

So let me get this straight. When it comes to "facts" about Israel, it is okay to use biased organizations' data that has questionable figures but with Sri Lanka its a no-go.

The issue is that of a supposedly oppressed nation and their oppressors, the timeline of events or individual comparisons of certain wars is inconsequential. You still cannot answer to the fact that there is a double standard when it comes to the treatment of Israel in the international community.

Why are my premises absurd? Because you disagree with them? I still stand by my argument - U.S. Jews who claim to be Zionists but stab their Israeli brethren in the back by delegitimizing their right to build freely in their own state are worse than kapos. You can call a group of people what ever you want but that does not make it the truth. The same as there are no longer Gauls, Saxons, Visigoths etc., the term Palestinian no longer makes any sense and is only a device to ultimately conquer the land in which Israel rests. Not just the West Bank, not just Gaza, everywhere from Kiryat Shmona to Eilat, Jerusalem and Tel Aviv included.

Well, its called war. When nations go to war, they are gambling with their people's lives and resources.

 

I am not talking about war between states, but the seizure of Palestinian Land in the West Bank inside of the 1973 borders controlled by Israel.
 
 
Please elaborate
 
 
 
and let's remember "Palestinians" didn't exist as such before 1967.

 

Care to explain ?

What were they called between '48 & '67.
 
 
 
Please elaborate

 

Following the conclusion of the 1973 Yom Kippur War, and the peace with Egypt and the Jordan, Israel is the sole national power of the West Bank. Under International Law and the laws and customs of war, the people who lived in the West Bank are solely Israel's respsonability- either to incorproate them into Israel, or failing that to help them achieve national self detemrination.

The Palestinians who live in the West Bank did not lose deed to thier lands in 1973 with the change of the flag. *Under established Israeli legal precedent those who do not flee war, retain title, as do those who occupy the lands of those who fled. This precendent held true through multiple changes of national flag.

Yet now, Israel sends seizes Palestinian land in the West Bank at will to create settlements for people who have no legal right to the land. Emigres may be Jewish, and Israel as a state has the right to collect in her diaspora. However, she does not have the right to seize land from captive populations to provide for them. The areas left to the Palestinians with the 1973 ceasefire are Palestinian and may not be legally taken from them.

Several clauses establish without reservation the fact that the West Bank is Palestinian.
4th CG, section III/47

Protected persons who are in occupied territory shall not be deprived, in any case or in any manner whatsoever, of the benefits of the present Convention by any change introduced, as the result of the occupation of a territory, into the institutions or government of the said territory, nor by any agreement concluded between the authorities of the occupied territories and the Occupying Power, nor by any annexation by the latter of the whole or part of the occupied territory. (as it applies to section II/46)

4th GC, section III/49.

Individual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of the Occupying Power or to that of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of their motive.

Nevertheless, the Occupying Power may undertake total or partial evacuation of a given area if the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand. Such evacuations may not involve the displacement of protected persons outside the bounds of the occupied territory except when for material reasons it is impossible to avoid such displacement. Persons thus evacuated shall be transferred back to their homes as soon as hostilities in the area in question have ceased....

The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.

 International Humanitarian Law - Fourth 1949 Geneva Convention 

zraver- Israel added no reservation to this clause when it signed in 1949 or when she ratified it in 1951

 Geneva Conventions 1949 - Israel reservation text 

As a signatory to the 4th GC Israel is bound by its provisions specifically, and its effects generally.

No, I got your point. You missed mine (well, ignored) - you are prone to exaggeration & selective interpetation.

Now this I like, you are actually bothering to defend the use of data from an organisation that supports mass-murdering terrorists. You just can't admit when you get it wrong, can you?

 
The issue is that of a supposedly oppressed nation and their oppressors, the timeline of events or individual comparisons of certain wars is inconsequential. You still cannot answer to the fact that there is a double standard when it comes to the treatment of Israel in the international community.

(COMMENT)

Although I am not sure, I do not believe that the Palestinians, or any government acting on behalf of the Palestinians, have reffered a case to the Prosecutor who then receives a referral, and pursuant to Article 53 initiates an investigation unless the Prosecutor determines that there is no reasonable basis to proceed under the "Rome Statute" of the International Criminal Court.

(POINT)

The code you are looking for is:

 
Article 8: War crimes
2. For the purpose of this Statute, "war crimes" means:
(b) Other serious violations of the laws and customs applicable in international armed conflict, within the established framework of international law, namely, any of the following acts:
(viii) The transfer, directly or indirectly, by the Occupying Power of parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies, or the deportation or transfer of all or parts of the population of the occupied territory within or outside this territory; Source:  Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court 
 
 

(QUESTION)
Who is acting on behalf of the Palestinians?
Why haven't they filed a complaint to the ICC? SEE:  ICC - Communications and Referrals  I can think of a number of reasons the Palestinians or supporting Arab Neighbors might not have made or referral or criminal complaint. But what is the reasoning that they don't attempt some formal redress? Why do they choose insurgent tactics and terrorism?

Is it possible that the Palestinians, or their Arab Mentors and caretakers/advocates, actually think that their is no reasonable cause to believe the Israelis are in violation? Or that the Israelis have a reasonable "self protection" interest?

Jews have the right of self detemrination.

Look at Adam's statement.

U.S. Jews who claim to be Zionists but stab their Israeli brethren in the back by delegitimizing their right to build freely in their own state are worse than kapos.

Adam is a self admitted zionist.

As far as I know no one is saying boo about Israeli's building in Israel. The West Bank and Gaza however are either not part of Israel (per intenrational law)- in which case Israel has no rights to the land. Or if it is part of Israel (Israel's claimed annexation), in which case the unlawful seizure of land and imposed ghettos the Palestinians have to live under create an aparthied state. Take your pick- the policies are beign pushed by the factions calling themselves zionist.

People can sugar coat it all they want, but look at the policies for the truth.

No they weren't, the land seized by Jordan and Egypt via agressive war is no more lega than Germany's annexation of Poland. The group was called Palestinians by the UN as part of the partition plan. That remains thier legal title.

Yes but Adam's article relates how there are many people who define themselves as zionist but do not support expansionist settlements or any such takeover of Muslim land.Are those self professed Zionists also racists? I really don't see how you can make a blanket statement that Zionism=Racism.

Yes, part of this is correct. Neither the US or Israel are current signatories to the Rome Statue.

 
Israel is not a party to the International Criminal Court. The ICC is not a worthwhile venue as a result.

 

(OBSERVATION)

Actually, both the US and Israel "unsigned" the ICC statue over the inclusion of this very section, even though the same agreement language exists in the GC.

 
The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.

 
2. For the purpose of this Statute, "war crimes" means: (b) Other serious violations of the laws and customs applicable in international armed conflict, within the established framework of international law, namely, any of the following acts: (viii) The transfer, directly or indirectly, by the Occupying Power of parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies, or the deportation or transfer of all or parts of the population of the occupied territory within or outside this territory;

 

 

(COMMENT)

IMO, this is a legal maneuver to avoid prosecution, and to act above the law (outside the Rule of Law), the concept used by the US as reasoning in a number of International Military Engagements.

In effect, it is an admission of guilt (on the part of the Israelis), as far as, the Occupied Territories are concerned. It is also a reason many hold the US as an accessory after the fact.

But there is a second part of the equation. Recognition of "statehood." It doesn't really matter if Israel is a signatory, as long as one of the parties to the complaint is. The problem here, is the recognition of the existence or the non‐existence of a State called Palestine, or some recognized government over part (or all) of Palestine. The people of the occupied territories cannot grant or remand the ICC jurisdiction of an issue - if they do not exercise authority over the occupied population.

If the "Occupied Territories" are not under the governance of some recognized body, then it is not a War Crime to establish settlements in a political wilderness (absent governance) that has no government that can actually exercise some control over its populations general welfare.

Most Respectfully,
R

However Palestine is not a politcal wilderness. The Palestinians have observer status at the UN and per the 4th GC Israel and the Palestinians have worked through recognized nuetral third parties like the UN and ICRC. The Palestinian People are a nation and almost a de facto state in some areas. Furthermore the UNSC 338 fixed Israel's borders pursuant to UNSCR 242. Although the Arabs like to claim clause 1 of 242 sets Israel's borders to what they were prior to the 1967 war, established legal precedent says otherwise. The gaining of territory through defensive war is legal. In fact the UN has allowed as much several times. Not just my earlier exmaples, but also the reduction of Germany, the attmept to re-unify Korea and other acts.

This is something entirely different. Now we are in the claim of military conquest over the occupied territories and annexation. It cannot be the case the "Occupied Territories" can hold both status as a "state" and "annexed" at the same time.

The head of state is that person who has executive powers unless otherwise defined.

Few states have completely settled bounderies. For example, the US, Russia, Canada, Denmark and Norway are invovled in a boundery dispute. The UK and Spain have a dispute, India, China and Pakistan have a three sided dispute.

There is wide international recognition inside and outside the UN that the West Bank and Gaza form the bounderies of the future Palestinian state(s).

 
This is something entirely different. Now we are in the claim of military conquest over the occupied territories and annexation. It cannot be the case the "Occupied Territories" can hold both status as a "state" and "annexed" at the same time.
 

Actually it can. We have several examples from history- Czechlovakia, Poland and parts of France were all annexed by Germany, yet they remained states. More recently, iraq annexed Kuwait, yet Kuwait remained a state.

Likewise Israel bounces back and forth between claiming the territories are occupied, autonomous or annexed based on which set of legal norms best serves them at the moment. For exmaple, when it comes to preventing official Palestinian statehood, Israel claims the rights of an occupying power, when it comes to meeting the needs of the Palestinian people, she claims they are autonmous and its the Palestinian or some other groups problem, when it comes to seizing land she claims the territories are part of Israel.

I reiterate, the settlements are being built upon land which is either owned by Israel or not owned by anyone at all since Jordan relinquished its hold of the West Bank.
 

see my earlier post on title/deed in israeli legal tradition.

 
You keep saying that Palestinians have an ancestral claim to the land but can you find evidence pre1948 that shows any indication of such a people ever existing in the region?
 

This is central to the charge, if you can de-legitimize the Palestinians as a recognized people, then obvious no genocide.

 
My answer to your jpost article is simple: Israel has no more responsibility to the people in West Bank and Gaza than the 21 Arab nations that promote the Palestinian Struggle as part of their daily anti-Semitic hate speech. We have a water crisis in Israel, we are doing our best to alleviate the situation but that does not mean that I as a tax payer should have equal availability to water as a person who pays no taxes and burns Israeli flags.
 

under international law, no matter what status Israel claims for the territories the biased water division leaving one group with less than survival amounts qualifies as a genocidal act.

racist-

 
While Joe Shmoe for Kentucky has every reason to fall for the appeal to emotion, a Jewish American should know better.
 

 
There is NO SUCH THING as a Palestinian as they are currently defined. These Arabs in Israel are nothing more than a bunch of Jordanians who got lost in the shuffle when they bet on the wrong horse in 1948.
 

 
As you may know, I am no fan of Arabs and I think Islam is a curse on this world. But of all the Arabs in the world, the ones I dislike the most are the "Israeli-Arabs"
 

 
My point is simple, the Arabs stick together, they may kill each other but when it comes to us vs. them, they know to support their own.
 

 
Thus the Palestinians do not have a nationalist claim to the land, nor do they have a religious claim to the land as denoted by their own religious text.
 

calling me an antisemite

I said in an earlier post, "finally, your style of debate centers around ad hominems and simple dismissals- not point by point discussion. I don't know how you hoodwinked Ben, he is a good guy. Even when we disagree he is solid. Had you bothered to ask him, you would not be trying to insinuate that I am an anti-Semite. He could have directed you to my defense of Israel during the Mamarra incident, or of Israel's cassus beli in 2006 and 2007." <--- thats the prediction

 
Well you have exposed how one-sided your ideology is in terms of how one looks at Israel.
 

You strongly imply that I favor the palestinians. In the same post at the end you say this,
 
Your perception of Zionism = Apartheid is so far from my perception of Palestinian = Antisemitism that we will probably never agree.
 

Ergo you call me and anyone else who doesn't choose Israel over the Palestinians an antisemite.

BTW, I said Zionism=racism not apartheid.
 
 
 
Care to explain ?

What were they called between '48 & '67.

 

The same thing as they were called before 48. Arabs.

Walid Shoebat, a former PLO activist has this to say about the situation:

Why is it that on June 4th 1967 I was a Jordanian and overnight I became a Palestinian?
We did not particularly mind Jordanian rule. The teaching of the destruction of Israel was a definite part of the curriculum, but we considered ourselves Jordanian until the Jews returned to Jerusalem. Then all of the sudden we were Palestinians - they removed the star from the Jordanian flag and all at once we had a Palestinian flag.
When I finally realized the lies and myths I was taught, it is my duty as a righteous person to speak out.

"There is no such country as Palestine. 'Palestine' is a term the Zionists invented. There is no Palestine in the Bible. Our country was for centuries part of Syria. 'Palestine' is alien to us. It is the Zionists who introduced it".

- Auni Bey Abdul-Hadi, Syrian Arab leader to British Peel Commission, 1937 -

"There is no such thing as Palestine in history, absolutely not".

- Professor Philip Hitti, Arab historian, 1946 -

"It is common knowledge that Palestine is nothing but Southern Syria".

- Representant of Saudi Arabia at the United Nations, 1956 -

"There are no differences between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese. We are all part of one nation. It is only for political reasons that we carefully underline our Palestinian identity... yes, the existence of a separate Palestinian identity serves only tactical purposes. The founding of a Palestinian state is a new tool in the continuing battle against Israel".

- Zuhair Muhsin, military commander of the PLO and member of the PLO Executive Council -

As pertaining to an Arab Islamic group of people, before this time there was never a Palestinian people, no Palestinian culture, language or currency. The word Palestine is not Arabic it is Latin and was used by Hadrian to rename the region of Judah after the defeat of the Jews on Masada. He chose to call it Palestina after the Philistines, the hated enemies of the Jewish People.

So while the term Palestinian may have existed, it certainly did not denote what it does today.
 
 
 
No, I got your point. You missed mine (well, ignored) - you are prone to exaggeration & selective interpetation.

I'm not ignoring any double standards, I'm paying attention to how you filter information.

Now this I like, you are actually bothering to defend the use of data from an organisation that supports mass-murdering terrorists. You just can't admit when you get it wrong, can you?

As I said, I'm not going to waste yet more time down this rabbit hole. I've been there before & my arguments are as good as yours.

You seem to be determined to prove my point. Every time you try to explain why you are right you make it clear just how absurd your ideas are. The fact that you clearly believe them doesn't make tham any less so.

 

Not a single logical argument in your entire post. Sorry but I don't buy it.
 
 
 
I can support the statements I make. However, if you want, after you answer a question, ask one. Heck ask the first one if you promise to answer in the same depth I do.

Again, I can support everyone one of those claims. If your not those things, perhaps change your writing style to reflect who you are.

This is not meant as an attack.

Trolling-

Z, the argument ad hominem crap can go back and forth ad nauseum. Trolling: Posting derogatory messages about sensitive subjects on newsgroups and chat rooms to bait users into responding. I did not do that, I was lured into the argument by crafty Ben who has been trying to get me to join for a while. So while I might offend you, I am certainly not trolling.

Your genocide argument is based on a poor definition of who owns the land. Keep in mind that the British Mandate of Palestine was entrusted to the United Kingdom by the League of Nations after World War I. The terms of the Mandate called for the creation in Palestine of a Jewish national home without prejudicing the civil and religious rights of the non-Jewish population of Palestine. The fact that Jordan annexed the land and then decided to give it to the PLO is inconsequential to the original agreement.

This goes back to your 1973 question. Israel never stole land, the land was not owned by anybody. Jordan decided to illegally take the land and then illegally assign it to the Palestinians. One cannot make laws based on step 5 of the historical process, it has to go back to step one.
So if your broad definition of genocide is based on Israel stealing land, then the genocide you speak of is clearly Jordan's fault.

I still cannot believe that, despite the facts, you still believe there is genocide on the part of Israel and not on the part of Syria, Jordan or Egypt which is why I stand by my claim that you have a one-sided view of Israel.

If denying the credibility of Arabs who claim to be a mythical nation makes me a racist, then color me racist. It means absolutely nothing because it is completely untrue. The same as they have a right to claim that they are Palestinian, I have a right to deny it. Bring me the proof. What is the Palestinian national anthem, currency, staple food. Where is the Palestinian nation mentioned in history before the 20th century. If they were once the indigenous people of the land, where are the ruins of their cities, where are the artifacts? Who were they conquered by and in what year?

One can identify with whatever nation they want, this does not give them a right to 3 sovereign states at the expense of one. Israel constitutes 0.1% of the ME in terms of landmass. Can't their state be established somewhere else in the 99.9% Arab owned ME? Why has Jordan rescinded the citizenship of Palestinians? And why do Palestinians still live in refugee camps in Jordan if they are provided with equal rights over there?

Why did the Palestinians remaining in Israel after the wars refuse to be absorbed into Israel as you suggested? Why is it that those who have are benefiting from doing so?

Israelis have learned the wrong lessons from the wars of the last decade. Although defensible borders would preserve Israel's latitude to act independently in the short run, it would undermine, rather than promote, its long-term security.

OK, sorry here it is :

Summary: A standing army in the West Bank will not keep Israelis safe. But a multilateral security agreement could.

OMAR M. DAJANI is Professor of Law at Pacific McGeorge School of Law and was a legal adviser to the Palestinian negotiating team during peace talks with Israel. EZZEDINE C. FISHERE is Professor of Politics at the American University in Cairo and a former adviser to the United Nations and the Egyptian foreign minister.

In her December 10 Middle East policy speech, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reiterated the United States' commitment to a negotiated peace between Israelis and Palestinians, calling for an agreement that would enable Palestinian leaders "to show their people that the occupation will be over" while allowing Israeli leaders to "demonstrate to their people that the compromises needed to make peace will not leave Israel vulnerable."

Although Clinton suggested that these aims are compatible, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has expressed a different view. Demanding the establishment of what Israeli officials call "defensible borders," Netanyahu's government seeks to annex or exercise security control over large blocs of West Bank territory -- along the Jordan River in the east and along Israel's border in the west, from the north-central settlement of Ariel to the Gush Etzion settlements south of Bethlehem.

In addition, it seeks to operate early-warning stations on high ground near the Palestinian cities of Nablus, Ramallah, and Hebron and maintain a military presence in the Jordan Valley for decades to come. This package of arrangements would create, in the words of Israeli negotiators, a "protection envelope" surrounding the new Palestinian state.

Such arrangements, however, will do little to respond to the real security challenges faced by Israelis, the Palestinians, and others in the region. As WikiLeaks recently revealed, other governments in the region are no less concerned than Israel about nuclear proliferation, the destabilizing role of nonstate actors, and the threat of cross-border missile attacks.
A U.S. peace plan built on the notion of defensible borders will neither address the threats perceived by Israel's neighbors nor win the support of their domestic constituencies, who demand faithful implementation of the Arab Peace Initiative. A different approach is needed, one that situates Israeli-Palestinian security arrangements within a regional security framework -- involving the Arab states, Turkey, and eventually Iran -- that can facilitate durable responses to the threats faced by the peoples of the Middle East.

Israeli security orthodoxy has long been built on two related premises: first, that Arab and Muslim hostility toward Israel is both inexorable and irrational -- so neither withdrawal nor peace is likely to offer Israelis major security dividends -- and second, that foreign powers and international institutions cannot be trusted to protect Israel.

To be sure, Israel's leaders have at times questioned the continuing relevance of these premises. Indeed, when seeking the Knesset's support for the Oslo agreement in 1993, the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin declared, "No longer are we necessarily 'a people that dwells alone,' and no longer is it true that 'the whole world is against us.'"

Over the last decade, however, widespread disillusionment with the Oslo process, and the sense that their unilateral withdrawal from southern Lebanon and the Gaza Strip served to embolden, rather than placate, enemies such as Hezbollah and Hamas, have led many Israelis to conclude that genuine peace is an elusive dream. Moreover, they cite the perceived failure of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon and the European Union Border Assistance Mission in Gaza to prevent rocket attacks on Israel as evidence that when the going gets tough, Israelis can rely only on themselves for security. Presented with this bleak security picture, many Israelis see the retention of West Bank territory -- i.e., the concept of defensible borders -- as not only politically desirable but also a strategic necessity.

Israelis have learned the wrong lessons from the wars of the last decade. Although defensible borders would preserve Israel's latitude to act independently in the short run, it would undermine, rather than promote, its long-term security. Israel's refusal to relinquish territory occupied in 1967 would give its enemies increased motivation to attack -- and bolster the perceived legitimacy of violence among Arabs disillusioned with the international community's failure to make good on the promise to deliver land for peace. And it would only marginally limit the capacity of Israel's enemies to inflict damage: Israel's efforts to shift its population away from its crowded coastline, along with steady advances in the range of missiles and rockets possessed by militant groups and nearby states, will leave Israelis vulnerable regardless of where the state's borders are drawn. And as the international community presses further toward accountability for war crimes, Israel will find it increasingly costly, legally and politically, to use overwhelming military force to deter attacks.

A policy of defensible borders would also perpetuate the current sources of Palestinian insecurity, further delegitimizing an agreement in the public's eyes. Israel would retain the discretion to impose arbitrary and crippling constraints on the movement of people and goods, and Palestinians would remain vulnerable to harassment by Israeli extremists and attacks by the Israel Defense Forces, whether unprovoked or in retaliation for the acts of Palestinian militants. For these reasons, Palestinians are likely to regard defensible borders as little more than occupation by another name.

If the Obama administration is genuinely committed to achieving a Middle East peace agreement that provides effective and durable responses to the risks and threats confronting both Israelis and Palestinians, it should pursue peace within a regional security framework that is built upon four pillars: the establishment of a regional security apparatus; the deployment of a multinational peace-implementation mission in Palestine; the integration of Hamas into Palestine's national political and security institutions; and Israel's full withdrawal behind the 1967 line, as revised pursuant to equitable, mutually agreed-upon land exchanges.

The first pillar -- a new regional security apparatus coordinated initially by the United States -- could integrate existing early-warning and missile-defense infrastructure in Israel and the Gulf and link it with future systems in eastern Turkey and Jordan, permitting more effective detection, tracking, and disabling of long-range missiles from the east. In addition, such an apparatus could provide a vehicle for intelligence sharing among the governments in the region. It could also help deter Iranian nuclear ambitions and provide a forum for arms control negotiations, allowing contentious nuclear proliferation issues to be addressed in tandem with conventional arms reductions.

Israel's participation in such a regime would enable it to strengthen its cooperation with Egypt and Jordan, rebuild its relationship with Turkey, and develop formal security relations with the Gulf states, rather than the tenuous and unofficial contacts it currently maintains. Embedding Israeli-Palestinian security relations within a regional framework could also help resolve issues that have divided the parties in the past. Israel could achieve far greater strategic depth by partnering with Jordan, Turkey, and the Gulf states in the realms of air security, early warning, and missile defense than it ever could by installing radar stations and a standing force in the West Bank
Second, a multinational peace-implementation mission could be deployed to continue the process of training Palestinian security forces, supervise the withdrawal of Israeli forces, mobilize rapid-reaction forces in areas of strategic importance, and monitor and verify compliance with security provisions of a peace agreement. An international mission would complement the regional security apparatus by bolstering the Palestinians' growing capacity to prevent smuggling, infiltration, and short-range rocket fire.

Several features would differentiate such a mission from the failed efforts of the past. It would be charged with reinforcing and facilitating the implementation of a peace agreement, rather than stabilizing the situation in the absence of one; it would have the authority and capacity to use force to implement its mandate, which would expire only with the consent of both Israel and Palestine; and it would operate under U.S. leadership while also drawing on the assistance of other nations. The unblemished record of the Multinational Force and Observers in the Sinai makes clear that international missions can be successful even in the Middle East if they have the proper mandate, the right force composition, and the support of both sides.

Third, integrating Hamas into Palestine's political and security institutions would bolster the durability of a peace agreement, reduce the risk of conflict, and substantially strengthen Israel's security. Israeli analysts have acknowledged that it is far easier to deter governments than militant groups -- a lesson that Israel recently learned in both Gaza and Lebanon -- while the continuing isolation of Hamas would give it every incentive to undermine political progress, making reaching a peace agreement difficult and implementing one impossible.

Hamas officials have dismissed the Quartet's call to recognize Israel. But Hamas has demonstrated that it will not be forced off the scene by either Israel or the Palestinian Authority government in the West Bank. And in a series of recent statements, the movement's Gaza leadership has made clear that it would accept an agreement embraced by the Palestinian public. If Hamas leaders are convinced that a peace agreement establishing a Palestinian state on the territory occupied by Israel since 1967 is imminent, they are more likely to seek a role in implementing it than to risk estranging public opinion by standing in its way.

Fourth, Israel's full withdrawal of its armed forces behind the 1967 line -- with minor and mutually agreed upon territorial exchanges -- would establish the political legitimacy of a peace deal across the Arab world, ensuring that the agreement can actually be implemented.

Securing the agreement of all relevant stakeholders to a framework of this kind will obviously present many challenges. However, the fragility of the current situation and the proven inadequacy of piecemeal approaches suggest that a regional approach is vital. The foundation for such a regime is already in place. The United States is pursuing a missile shield in eastern Turkey under the auspices of NATO and has invested heavily in early-warning and missile-defense systems in the Gulf states, and its allies in the area are seeking both to upgrade their own systems with U.S. technology and establish stronger cooperation. The United States can also draw on the important lessons learned by peacekeeping missions over the last decade by immediately convening a planning forum to ensure that an international mission can be operational the day after a peace agreement is signed.

Discarding the dead-end concept of defensible borders and pursuing a regional security strategy would give the next phase of the Obama administration's Israeli-Palestinian peace effort much-needed focus and credibility. And it would give the United States a leadership role in erecting a security framework that is good not only for Israel but also for the Palestinians and other U.S. allies in the Middle East.

The fact that Jordan annexed the land and then decided to give it to the PLO is inconsequential to the original agreement.

 

two things, please stop ignoring my what I actually right. I already illustrated using Israel's own legal precedents that private property ownership does not change when the national flag changes. This is not a poor understanding of the definition of land ownership.
Secondly, if you want to use the Balfour Declaration, then use all of it. The declration called for a home not a state, as a Jewish controlled state would be its very nature predijuice the civil rights of locals.

 
This goes back to your 1973 question. Israel never stole land, the land was not owned by anybody. Jordan decided to illegally take the land and then illegally assign it to the Palestinians. One cannot make laws based on step 5 of the historical process, it has to go back to step one.
 

The UN not Jordan assigned the land as part of the partition plan.The remnants of that area- Gaza and the West Bank are Palestinian not Jordanian.

 
So if your broad definition of genocide is based on Israel stealing land, then the genocide you speak of is clearly Jordan's fault.
 

Jordan's annexation attempt changed the flag, it did not displace the locals or lock them into water and reosurce deprived ghettos to make room for non-native emigres.

 
I still cannot believe that, despite the facts, you still believe there is genocide on the part of Israel and not on the part of Syria, Jordan or Egypt which is why I stand by my claim that you have a one-sided view of Israel.
 

Israel isn't a kindergarten kid, she is a nation, she alone is responsible for her actions taken in violation of binding international agreements she is party to.

 
If denying the credibility of Arabs who claim to be a mythical nation makes me a racist, then color me racist. It means absolutely nothing because it is completely untrue. The same as they have a right to claim that they are Palestinian, I have a right to deny it. Bring me the proof. What is the Palestinian national anthem, currency, staple food. Where is the Palestinian nation mentioned in history before the 20th century. If they were once the indigenous people of the land, where are the ruins of their cities, where are the artifacts? Who were they conquered by and in what year?
 

Some of that proof has already been offered and ignored by you. Again in case you missed it- the Samaritans and genetic testing to which we can also add the Christian communities (including those who later converted). There is a documented non-Jewish presence in Palestine going back before the writing of the Talmud in some cases.

 
One can identify with whatever nation they want, this does not give them a right to 3 sovereign states at the expense of one. Israel constitutes 0.1% of the ME in terms of landmass. Can't their state be established somewhere else in the 99.9% Arab owned ME? Why has Jordan rescinded the citizenship of Palestinians? And why do Palestinians still live in refugee camps in Jordan if they are provided with equal rights over there?
 

The 99% of the ME doesn't matter. What Jordan does is not material etc. Israel is in violation of international law as regards the West Bank and Gaza.

 
Why did the Palestinians remaining in Israel after the wars refuse to be absorbed into Israel as you suggested? Why is it that those who have are benefiting from doing so?
 

Israeli Arabs are not the question- how Israel treats Palestinians in the west bank and Gaza are.

You claim to use logic, but I don't see it. Israel has commitments under international law- commitments she is failing. The proper use of logic requires a lack of percetion bias. What I see in your arguments is a reliance on logical fallacies. Until and unless you are able to admit and accept that Israel is responsible for the actions of Israel your arguments looks childish. Would you acept your kids saying some bad behaviour was suddenly Ok if they balemd someone else for "making them"? Jordan did not make Israel build Jewish only roads across the West Bank. Roads that have since locked the Palestinians in to virtual ghettos. Jordan did not make Israel seize land in violation of Israel's own legal tradition, Jordan did not make Israel employ an unfair water scheme, Jordan did not make Israel violate the 4th Geneva Convetions.
 
 
 
so, adam, would israel accept a one-state solution encorporating palestinians/arabs/whomever into its polity as israeli citizens?

 

Well I can't speak for Israel, but for myself. Ideally, I think that the answer lies with the original plan for the mandate. A Jewish state, run by the Jewish people where Arabs have full rights apart from the right to vote in an Arab leadership. Other than the right to vote, Arabs would enjoy the same rights that every other Israeli citizen has including healthcare, freedom of speech, freedom of movement, religious freedom, etc. This is no different to the Sharia law of Islam.

On a side-note, I do not believe democracy to be the best system. I agree with John Stuart Mills concept of the tyranny of the masses and another philosopher (whose name eludes me right now, not Plato) who said that only educated people should have the power to change government. In my opinion, a person should only be granted the right to vote after they have completed their education in government affairs and civics and have passed a test on the matter. We give far too much power to those whose best interests come before society's.

ie a state that legally discriminates along the basis of religion and race.

 
This is no different to the Sharia law of Islam.
 

going for the highest denominator, i see. so israel should implement something along the basis of "jewish" sharia.

 
On a side-note, I do not believe democracy to be the best system.
 

well, it's pretty clear that you don't, although i wonder how the technocratic sentiments that you profess fare in comparison to the religious and racial aspects that you mentioned above. ie let us wave a wand and assume that the israeli arabs suddenly all became educated in government affairs and civics and passed that test; would you still prohibit them the right to vote in an arab/non-jewish leadership?
 
 
 
ie a state that legally discriminates along the basis of religion and race.

 

In the same manner that a person who was not born in the U.S. cannot become the president. I don't see a problem with discrimination in certain circumstances. I am not liberal, I profusely apologize.

 
going for the highest denominator, i see. so israel should implement something along the basis of "jewish" sharia.

 

Its more like a relative comparison. I would still rather live comfortably in a country where I have every right except the vote than live in a country where I can vote but I am treated like complete shit either way. Why do the Muslims get the highest denominator? Not fair!

Why only Israeli-Arabs? Every person on this planet regardless of race, religion, creed should have to pass such a test in their respective countries before having the right to vote. So much so that I would rather have an educated Arab vote than an uneducated Israeli. This is why I said ON A SIDE NOTE - it is not directly related to the discussion at hand but sure, misconstrue what I am saying.

This is no different to the Sharia law of Islam.
 

So you will support the Islamic fundementalists also, if you want to copy them?

A cop out methinks to support your "POV"

Enjoying the debate though.
 
 
I don't support Islamic fundamentalists. I am trying to make a comparison that Muslims would be able to relate to. I do not agree with Sharia law but in this case, we have a similar ideal - "you can live in my country freely but you can't make decisions that affect the basic foundations of it". Any country that employs a constitution technically employs the same method - regardless of democratic vote, certain basic tenets stand.
 
 
 
There is a documented Jewish presence in the land since the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 A.D.

 

Ben, we know the Jews have had a presence in the land, a presence that was never fully extinquished. However, other groups have as well. Some of them are decedents of Caananites, others are coverted Jewsish stock, some wer emoved in by the Babylonians, Greeks and Romans and many trace to sometime after the rise of Islam.

However, not all jews have ancient ties to the land. The Ethipioan Jews and Khazaars for example are converts not decendents. The only link they have is religion and that religion gives them more rights than Palestinians genetically proven to be traced to ancient Jewish racial stock.
 
 
I could say that 12 years ago your nation did not gave a crap about that argument.I'm not saying you're wrong,just adding some perspective.

So would a Jew who covnerted lose thier vote? Does a Moslem who converts gain the vote?
 
 
Don't see why not.
 
 
 
Don't see why not.

 

The danger lies in who decides who is a Jew. Do secular Jews lose the right to vote? If they don't, how do you defend deciding the vote based on religion?

More importantly, what happens if the breeding trends don't change? Israel has a brewing demographic problem. What do you do when the majority cannot vote?

Finally, none of that solves the problem of what to do about the West Bank and Gaza. There are millions of people there living in conditions you would not accept for Jews. Where do they go an dhow do they get there? Are you willing to do what it would take to solve that problem- could Israel live with herself if she did? Would the world let Israel live if she did?

The West Bank and Gaza are a stain, a cancer on Israel. The whole reason the world acted and created Israel was to prevent another holocaust. So far Israel has not been willing to take that ultimate step. But I invite you to compare the Ghettos Jews lived in, the lack of property rights, the discrimination based on religion and false histories trumped up to explude the jews from the body politic and compare that to Israel's policy towards the Palestinians.

Israeli policy towards the Palestinians is treason to every good thing the Jews have brought the world. Your kids and grand kids deserve better than to grow up in a nation despised for not honoring treaties and willful disregard for basic human rights.

If one arrived from Mars today, one might agree with you. But if one arrived on May 15th, 1948, one would not.

Doubtful, Israeli policy towards the Palestinians is not justifiable. In 1947 the local Arabs rejected a partition plan that was not equitable to start with. In fact the partition plan was in violation of the UN Charter.(1) In 1947 Jews owned less than 20% of the land in Palestine, the remainder was Arab owned. Yet the partition plan drawn up without local input awarded 56% of the land to the Jews. It is no wonder the Palestinians chose war, you would have to in their shoes.

They lost a series of war and as a result Israel expanded, there is no real issue there. However, following the 1973 war, the wars for Israel's survival ended. From the end of that war to today is the time period that matters. 47-73= 26 years vs 67-11= 42 years for the West Bank and Gaza. Israel never formally annexed these lands, as to do so would give the residents citizenship.

Yet since 1967, the area slowly taken by Israel to build settlements, barriers, roads, military bases and nature reserves has gobbled up 40% of the region. (2) This 40% is set up as to divide the remaining 60% into over 200 enclaves, of which more than 190 are less than 2 square kilometers. That massively divided 60% has to support 1.5 million people, while the remaining 40% has less than half a million. 70% of that 1.5 million are native to the area to before 1948.

That is not just no matter how you slice it. The conflict between Israel and the Palestinians is as much Israel's fault as anyone's'.

Lets take Hamas, absolutely a despicable terrorist group. One of Israel's responses to Hamas terror is to cut food to Gaza. In 2007, 70% of Palestinians in Gaza suffer from malnutrition caused by a lack of nutrients. Yet despite this Israel bans most things related to agriculture. Incubators for chicken eggs, parts to repair irrigation systems, live stock, greenhouse components, planters are or were banned. This is one reason the blockade is seen by so many as illegal collective punishment.

However, to Israel all armed Palestinian action is terrorism. While we agree that rocket attacks on schools, suicide bombings of eateries and shooting up buses are terror. Israel also includes attacks on members of the IDF as terror. In effect, Israel denies the right of the Palestinians to defend themselves.(3)

The situation is even worse in the West Bank. Jewish only roads and checkpoints, barrier walls and settlements have divided the West Bank into a series of small ghettos where Palestinians are living in over crowded slums. On the other side of these walls, emigres get about 450 liters of water a day- enough for swimming pools. Palestinians may get as little as 50 liters a day- half what the WHO says is needed.

This population transfer is illegal no matter what status Israel tries to claim. If the land is Israel's then the Palestinians are citizens denied and she is an apartheid state. If its not Israeli land, then the 4th GC is being violated.(4)

How would you feel if a government showed up with tanks, built roads across your land cutting you off from your fields, your extended family, your friends and your community. Then they took much of your land to give away to outsiders who they then set up in facilities whose features and access you could only dream about experiencing. The when you complained about it, they told you that you didn't really own land despite the government's own established legal precedent.(5)(6) Then imagine having to watch soldiers grab your child and force him to act as a human shield. Or imagine you have a 20 year old kid who needs medical treatment dying at a border crossing-denied entry and access to life saving medical care the government is treaty bound to provide. Now compare those acts to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights- to which Israel did not vote no to when given the chance in December of 1949. (7)

As an occupying power Israel has legal obligations to treaties she signed. She is in blatant defiance of those obligations. She is open defiance of the UN Security Council and other international agreements she is party to.

So would a Jew who covnerted lose thier vote? Does a Moslem who converts gain the vote?

 

If that were possible, it would certainly be up for discussion. However, according to Judaism and Islam, apostasy is religious treason. While in Israel, not much will happen if a Jew converts, in Islamic countries, apostasy is pretty much a death sentence.

The solution to such a problem would be a pledge of allegiance to the flag of Israel and a counter-law of death penalty for espionage/treason. So that if all citizens of Israels must pledge allegiance and anybody found guilty of treason would be sentenced to death, I would have no issue with any individual becoming a citizen. The United States currently has a pledge of allegiance and the death penalty for treason.

In response to an earlier comment you made - do you know of anybody today who has definitive proof that they descend from Canaanites? The only people who are definitively Canaanites are the descendants of Phoenicians who are now mistakenly referred to as Lebanese Arabs. The ancient Phoenicians however were more similar to the Hebrews then they were to the Arabs who arrived in the Levant centuries after the Phoenicians and the Israelites had established themselves. By the time the first Proto-Arab had arrived in the region, the Philistines had long been assimilated into the surrounding peoples, primarily the Hasmoneans who happened to be Jews.

March 2003, 7(1): 67-71. doi:10.1089/109065703321560976.

One Y-specific DNA polymorphism (p49/Taq I) was studied in 54 Lebanese and 69 Palestinian males, and compared with the results found in 693 Jews from three communities (Oriental, Sephardic, and Ashkenazic). Lebanese, Palestinian, and Sephardic Jews seem to be similar in their Y-haplotype patterns, both with regard to the haplotype distributions and the ancestral haplotype VIII frequencies. The haplotype distribution in Oriental Jews is characterized by a significantly higher frequency of haplotype VIII. These results confirm similarities in the Y-haplotype frequencies in Lebanese, Palestinian, and Sephardic Jewish men, three Near-Eastern populations sharing a common geographic origin.

Unfortunately, the sources for you facts are notoriously anti-Israel. The UNSC has more resolutions regarding Israel (251) than those regarding Iraq (87), Rwanda (25), Sudan (39) and Yugoslavia (83) combined.

Considering 800,000 people died in the Rwanda genocide and Sudan's figures stand at 20,000 - 400,000 depending on who you believe. Iraq has seen 100,000 deaths since 2003 while the Kosovo War resulted in over 15,000 civilian deaths, a third of which were caused by NATO.

Sudan is just one of the countries that still has ongoing genocide and yet the focus is on Israel. The United Nations defines genocide as "a denial of the right of existence of entire human groups, as homicide is the denial of the right to live of individual human beings; such denial of the right of existence shocks the conscience of mankind, results in great losses to humanity in the form of cultural and other contributions represented by these human groups, and is contrary to moral law and to the spirit and aims of the United Nations". This occurs in several countries in the world but not in Israel.

The UN has allowed memberships of the People's Republic of China, Zimbabwe, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan, and the past memberships of Algeria, Syria, Libya, and Vietnam on the Commission on Human Rights - I would not consider them a balanced or reliable source of information when it comes to such issues.

The Red Cross society only accepted Magen David Adom in 2006 and the emblem of the red star of David was replaced by a red crystal so as not to upset the Muslims. The ICRC often gets involved in criticizing Israeli policies while harboring members of Hamas - a terrorist organization.

Of course the argument leads back to whether the territories are occupied or disputed. Palestinians are free to buy land in Israel while the death penalty has been threatened against those who sell land to Israelis. Again, since both Egypt and Jordan gave up their claim to the land, Israel had taken the territory in war. According to Alan Dowty "the West Bank was not part of a sovereign country before occupation—thus, in legal terms, there is no "reversioner" for the West Bank. This means that sovereignty of the West Bank is currently suspended, and, according to some, Israel, as the only successor state to the Palestine Mandate, has a status that "goes beyond that of military occupier alone."

The way I see it, you have a group of people who claim they deserve sovereignty. Israel will not give them citizenship, Jordan is taking their citizenship away. It is quite clear that one of two things needs to happen:

1)Either they get their own state an idea I brought up in my first scenario in which we start with Gaza and move on from there provided there is peace and recognition of Israel.

2)My second scenario in which Israel adopts a pledge of allegiance and capital punishment for treason.
 
 
 
So you would go down the Islamist path and kill those who do not worship as you do?

 

Another loaded question... Did you read the second part where I wrote "The solution to the problem"

Also your links misconstrue what I asked. We know that Oriental Jews and Arabs share common ancestors. We also know that at some stage Jews left Israel and mixed with other races in the world thus creating Sephardi and Ashkenazi Jews as well. I am asking for an Arab descendant of a Phoenician.

Yes I do glad you asked. Here are three links covering 4 seperate genetic studies.

 Israel, The Good Enemy 

Israels relationship to the Palestinians has always been globally approached with standardized heavy criticism made to Israel. The main charges waved in Israels face have always been the Disapropriate use of force and discrimination.

Israels critics, either willingly or out of ignorance, choose to overlook the way many Arab countries mistreat Palestinians. Some Arab countries are almost never blamed for what they have been doing to the Palestinians for decades. Such selective recognition of facts by Israels critics is bizarre when weighed by truth instead of myths.

In December of 2008, Israel launched operation cast lead against Hamas which was launching rockets on Southern Israel on a daily basis. This operation has resulted in the death of more than 1,400 Palestinians, many said to be civilians; an absolute tragedy, nonetheless, those criticizing Israel fail to recognize that the number of causalities is small comparing to Gazas population of 1.5 million, considering the high density of Gazas population per square kilometre, the number suggests the Israeli forces were very cautious in carrying out their attacks, despite the fact that they were chasing a moving target, Hamas militants. If Israeli forces were targeting Palestinian civilians, the number of the dead would have reached tens of thousands.

On comparison; in 1976, Lebanese militiamen butchered 2,000 Palestinians; almost wiping out the entire population of Tell al-Zaatar refugee camp within days. This was revisited again in 1982 in Sabra and Shatelah massacre; where, in less than four days, Lebanese militiamen killed thousands of women and children who posed no threat as most Palestinian fighters had left then to Tunisia. Two years ago, al-Jazeera satellite network aired rare footage of Palestinians running to Israeli soldiers for refuge from the massacre.

Furthermore, most Arab atrocities against Palestinians have included documented rape cases, even of children, while not a single rape case has been reported against Israeli forces in more than sixty years of operations.

Arab governments oppression of the Palestinians does not stop at bloodshed and wholesale slaughters, in fact the more troubling aspects of the way they treat Palestinians is in the systematic long-range exclusion and discrimination. In Arab countries where Palestinians make up a good percentage of the population; they are depraved of all basic necessities, starting with education, down to basic healthcare. Even at countries that have granted the Palestinians citizenships; the Palestinians stand helpless and banned from every potential to improve their livelihoods.

Israel, on the other hand, has always allowed Palestinians to work there and to get paid in Western standards, and even had allowed them generous access to healthcare. In fact, Israel has also welcomed Palestinians as visitors, patients and even as investors, this generosity was only limited when Hamas started bombing Israeli civilians with no signs of an end in sight.

The complexity Israel has with Palestinians revolves around security rather than ideological issues; Israel does not have an aim to enslave the Palestinians for life or purposely degrade their humanity. While many Arab countries have designed their systems to discriminate and humiliate the Palestinians, squeezing them into illiteracy and poverty while milking them for tax money.

This has become most visible recently with calls in some Arab countries to revoke citizenships of all Palestinians there and actually to force them to seek local guarantors to obtain residency, thus enslaving them for life.

This comes as a deeper shock for Palestinians when they see Israeli Arabs, with many of them describing themselves as Palestinians in Israel; those are full citizens of Israel with access to all privileges. Israeli Arabs are fully represented inside the Knesset while Palestinians, in their Arab homeland, are allowed only symbolic presence in parliaments, even at countries where they are the majority. And while some Arab countries selectively withdraw citizenships from Palestinians, many Arab Knesset members do not hesitate to speak against Israel with no fear of losing their citizenships or entitlements.

Still, while the world is most vocal about Israeli military operations, it fails to recognize that Israel has been dealing with non-stop unrest on its soil since the breakout of the Intifada in 1987. Has that Intifada taken place in any Arab country; it would have ended within the first couple of weeks with an Arab army killing more than ten thousands Palestinians, most being civilians. Examples of this are countless and in all Arab countries hosting Palestinians; yet the world seems to think this reality is too overrated to recognize.

Today, with peace negotiations up and running, some Arab governments seem to want to butcher the Palestinians again on the altar of dictatorship by worsening their living conditions and making their lives more miserable, just to secure a better negotiating position or merely a seat at the negotiations table. Not to mention that many of those actually would rather see the negotiations fail in order to keep more international aid money flowing to them for hosting the Palestinians.

Quoting a commentator on one of my articles; the Palestinians, do obviously need a break from their sworn Arab friends, and perhaps they can reconnect to them when they have learned a lesson or two from their Israeli enemies.

Meanwhile, the world will remain silent about the Palestinians suffering at the hands of some of their brothers, as its too occupied with Israel.

Strange it appears sometimes the links work others not.................oh well here is the article.......

The Times Wednesday, January 12

The European Union is pushing for concrete steps to force Israel to relinquish its hold over east Jerusalem and allow the disputed area  conquered by the Jewish state in 1967  to one day become the capital of a Palestinian state.

In a sign of the growing differences between Israel and Europe, an internal EU report called on diplomats not to allow Israeli security personnel to accompany them in east Jerusalem, to mark their national days only in the east, to push for a representative Palestinian office there and to prevent European investment linked to Jewish settlements.

It also recommended barring Jewish settlers with a record of violence from entering EU countries, and using diplomats as monitors when Jerusalems council sends in bulldozers to destroy Palestinian property or evict families.

The tough new guidelines will concern Israel, which recently clashed with Washington, its main ally, over its refusal to stop building settlements. Israel says that it is facing an international campaign to delegitimise it and has suffered increasing diplomatic isolation since its right-wing Government came to power two years ago.

The EU made clear its anger in a statement delivered by Baroness Ashton of Upholland, its foreign policy chief, after Jerusalem City Council gave permission for the demolition of an abandoned hotel in east Jerusalem to make way for new Jewish homes.

I strongly condemn [the] demolition of the Shepherd Hotel and planned construction of a new illegal settlement. I reiterate that settlements are illegal under international law, undermine trust between parties and constitute an obstacle to peace, she said. We recall that east Jerusalem is part of occupied Palestinian territory; the EU does not recognise the annexation by Israel.

Yesterday, a spokesman for Ban Ki Moon, the UN Secretary-General, said: Such actions seriously prejudice the possibility of a negotiated solution.

The Shepherd Hotel once belonged to the wartime Palestinian leader Haj Mohammed Amin al-Husseini, who sided with Nazi Germany against the British Mandate. It was seized after the 1967 war under Israels absentee property law, which took over buildings vacated by fleeing Arabs. The hotel was later sold to Irving Moskowitz, the American Jewish millionaire.

The EU report, compiled by Brussels for the 25 heads of mission in east Jerusalem who are effectively ambassadors to the Palestinian territories, said: If current trends are not stopped... the prospect of east Jerusalem as the future capital of a Palestinian state becomes increasingly unworkable. This seriously endangers the chances of a sustainable peace on the basis of two states, with Jerusalem as their future capital.

Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister, insisted that the building was legal and added: Just as Jerusalems Arab citizens are allowed to buy or rent assets in Jerusalems neighbourhoods that have a Jewish majority, Jews are allowed to rent property in a Jerusalem neighbourhood with an Arab majority.
 
 
 
Unfortunately, the sources for you facts are notoriously anti-Israel. The UNSC has more resolutions regarding Israel (251) than those regarding Iraq (87), Rwanda (25), Sudan (39) and Yugoslavia (83) combined.

 

Iraq was a problem from 1981 to 2003- 22 years orl 3.95 resolutions per year or. Israel and Palestine have been on the world stage since 1948- 63 years or 3.98 per year. The Sudan (until recently) and Rwanda were sadly not importnat to the global economy or the major powers. Yet your claiming a 100 day event in Rwanda generated 25 resoltions which would be over 80 per year. Yugoslavia was a problem 92-99- 7 years or 11.85 per year. Over the length of the issue the bias you claim is not evident based on like v like sitiuations where a conflict affected the global order.

 
Considering 800,000 people died in the Rwanda genocide and Sudan's figures stand at 20,000 - 400,000 depending on who you believe. Iraq has seen 100,000 deaths since 2003 while the Kosovo War resulted in over 15,000 civilian deaths, a third of which were caused by NATO.
 

Since 2000- 4226 Palestinian cicilians have been killed by Israeli kilitary action. This according to Jewish sources.
 Israelis and Palestinians Killed since 9/29/2000 

More importantly the legal defintion of genocide does not require killing and is not defined by the death count.

 
Sudan is just one of the countries that still has ongoing genocide and yet the focus is on Israel. The United Nations defines genocide as "a denial of the right of existence of entire human groups, as homicide is the denial of the right to live of individual human beings; such denial of the right of existence shocks the conscience of mankind, results in great losses to humanity in the form of cultural and other contributions represented by these human groups, and is contrary to moral law and to the spirit and aims of the United Nations". This occurs in several countries in the world but not in Israel.
 

A UN document may say that, but the UN and the world define genocide per the 1948 Convention On Genocide
 Convention on Genocide 

 
The UN has allowed memberships of the People's Republic of China, Zimbabwe, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan, and the past memberships of Algeria, Syria, Libya, and Vietnam on the Commission on Human Rights - I would not consider them a balanced or reliable source of information when it comes to such issues.
 

Strawman, I haven't used information from the human rights commission.

 
The Red Cross society only accepted Magen David Adom in 2006 and the emblem of the red star of David was replaced by a red crystal so as not to upset the Muslims. The ICRC often gets involved in criticizing Israeli policies while harboring members of Hamas - a terrorist organization.
 

The ICRC was empowered by the UN to critize national policies on behalf of protected persons. They are doing what they were empowered to do. I would like some proof that the ICRC is hiding terrorists. How exactly are a bunch of extraterritorial unarmed medical and aid workers going to stop either Hamas or the IDF?

 
Of course the argument leads back to whether the territories are occupied or disputed. Palestinians are free to buy land in Israel while the death penalty has been threatened against those who sell land to Israelis.
 

No one including Palestinians and Israeli-arabs can buy land is Israel from the 93.5% considered Israeli or state lands. To claim freedom to buy land when only 6.5% of the land is private property is misleading.

 Can Arabs Buy Land in Israel? :: Middle East Quarterly 

 
Again, since both Egypt and Jordan gave up their claim to the land, Israel had taken the territory in war. According to Alan Dowty "the West Bank was not part of a sovereign country before occupation—thus, in legal terms, there is no "reversioner" for the West Bank. This means that sovereignty of the West Bank is currently suspended, and, according to some, Israel, as the only successor state to the Palestine Mandate, has a status that "goes beyond that of military occupier alone."
 

It may go beyond that of occupier alone, in fact it does as I explained in my post and refrenced with the UN Charter Chapter XI and 4th CG III/49. Th area however was not a politcal wilderness nor was it lacking a population like some remote island. In fact the rights of the Palestinian people were specifically mentioned in the Balfour Declration.

 The Balfour Declaration 

Nor did the partition plan award the areas now called the West Bank and Gaza to Jordan and Egypt respectively. Thier annexation was illegal under international law 4GC III/47. Egypt and Jordan did not have the legal right to cede the territory. This is re-enforced by the decision of the UN Security Council in 1976 to grant the PLO de-facto national authority status to represent the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. Furthermore at the 1974 Arab League Summit (Rabat Summit) Jordan offically renounced all claims to the region in an International Forum.

Hussein bin Talal, King of Jordan, in his address to the 1974 Rabat Summit in Morocco, stated:

"If our Arab brethren at this exalted conference are of the view that the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan does not have the legitimacy of speaking in the name of the Palestinians who live in its midst, who carry its citizenship and who have become part of its institutions, or of defending the right of this people, or of striving to regain their usurped land, or of lifting occupation and doing away with aggression, and if they deem this legitimate aspect to be restricted to the Palestine Liberation Organization alone, then in the name of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, I place on their shoulders alone the responsibility of their decision and all the consequences it entails. I consider it to be a release of our current political responsibilities. We leave the verdict on this decision, if taken, to history."

 What was the 1974 Rabat Summit and what was its significance for the PLO? - Israeli-Palestinian Conflict - ProCon.org 

The Jordanian position was affirmed again in 1986 and 1988. Later in 1988 the PLO as the recongized politcal head of the Palestinian People declared independence and recognized Israel's right to exist.

 Encyclopedia of the United Nations... - Google Books 

Offically and legally the territories are occupied and not subject to annexation.

 
The way I see it, you have a group of people who claim they deserve sovereignty. Israel will not give them citizenship, Jordan is taking their citizenship away. It is quite clear that one of two things needs to happen:
 

You start from an incorrect premis- they do not claim the deserve, they do deserve.

1)Either they get their own state an idea I brought up in my first scenario in which we start with Gaza and move on from there provided there is peace and recognition of Israel.[/quote]

Start in the West Bank, remove the settlements and share the water on a equitable per capita basis. Gaza is a basket case and not ready for effective self government.

 
2)My second scenario in which Israel adopts a pledge of allegiance and capital punishment for treason.
 

If you deny them the vote but give it to Jews (I assume you disenfranchise Israeli-Arabs) you set up an apathied regime in violation of intenrational law.

 Israel, The Good Enemy 

Israel’s relationship to the Palestinians has always been globally approached with standardized heavy criticism made to Israel. The main charges waved in Israel’s face have always been “the Disapropriate use of force” and “discrimination”.....

 

Ben, the way Arabs treat Palestinians can be shameful. However, as far as I know, refugees do not gain and are not entitled to citizenship in the land of refuge under international law but retain the nationality of the land they fled. This creates a problem for Lebanon in particular since there is no right of return no matter how much Hezzbollah claims it. However the situation outsoide the occupied territories probably deserves its own thread since the issues and players are so different. In Jordan there are nearly 2 million Palestinians but less than 200K do not have citizenship. The yellow carders are post war emigres not refugees. In regards to Syria, I have no idea how they are treated, buts its Syria so I have no illusions.

Also, Amnesty International has spoken up about Lebanon's refugees.

No they weren't, the land seized by Jordan and Egypt via agressive war is no more lega than Germany's annexation of Poland. The group was called Palestinians by the UN as part of the partition plan. That remains thier legal title.

 

You mean the resolution 181 that they rejected?

The partition plan called "Palestinians" to any inhabitants of the British Mandate who met certain conditions irrespective of whether they were Arabs, Jews or whatever - thus it didn't define any particular "group", and certainly did not define a national denomination, which was the original point.

That should be sufficient. I'll just add that whatever is referred to as their "legal title" is just an invention. If any such thing existed, then resolution 242, which is the resolution that followed the so called "occupation", would have mentioned it, but funny, the word "Palestinians" does not appear anywhere in 242.
 
 
I'll just point out that on my aunt's US birth certificate it says she was born in "Jerusalem, Palestine", since she was born pre-'67. She's about as Arab as I am
 
 
 
"It is common knowledge that Palestine is nothing but Southern Syria".

- Representant of Saudi Arabia at the United Nations, 1956 -.

 

The quote is accurate, but the guy who said it was Ahmad al-Shukeiri, who at the time he said it before the UN, March 31st 1956, was I believe the Secretary General for the Arab League - in any case, the extremely interesting bit is that this very guy later became the first Chairman of the PLO in 1964.

For every anti-Israel report you give, I can give a pro-Israel version. There is an omission of the fact that according to the Geneva Conventions, many of those civilian deaths are the responsibility of Hamas/PA. It is a requirement of the Geneva Convention to wear a uniform and segregate your fighters from the civilian population.

The genocide argument is getting old. One cannot commit genocide and not commit genocide simultaneously. Israel does not actively try to kill or prevent birth. We give the Palestinians aid, food, medicine and funds -  Behind the Headlines: The Israeli humanitarian lifeline to Gaza .

So either we are trying to destroy the Palestinians or we aren't. It can't be both.

Yes but that is the prerogative of the state. Its not a perfect situation and I believe that land should be available to all as long as the best interests of the country are at heart. Israel is not perfect and I can see why one would view this negatively.

The fact remains that 20% of Israel is privately owned and the JNF who own 13% of the land will not sell to non-Jews. This is not purely directed at Arabs but at all non-Jews. Keep in mind your article is from 1997 - the high court have been fighting this law for a while now.

War changes things - It is still a multiple party responsibility and once a deal is taken off the table and the parties go to war, the terms change. This is reality. We cannot go back to what once was because agreements were made despite the bleeding heart desire for Utopia. Many people have been displaced in wars that should not have affected them to begin with. The fact that after over 60 years, the Palestinians are still refugees is absurd. It is another political device to heap unfair pressure on Israel.

 
The Jordanian position was affirmed again in 1986 and 1988. Later in 1988 the PLO as the recongized politcal head of the Palestinian People declared independence and recognized Israel's right to exist.

 

Not exactly, 1988 was the Great Compromise. The PLO only officially recognized Israel in 1993. The fact that Israel wasn't represented shows how much of a compromise it was. The Arabs decided that the Jewish capital was their capital and we were just supposed to accept it?

In truth, they know we never will which allows them to continue their struggle for liberation. Even if we give them the West Bank and Gaza, they will still be occupied until they have every inch of the land of Israel.

 
Offically and legally the territories are occupied and not subject to annexation.

 

Land that is not owned cannot be occupied. The same as an object that is not owned cannot be stolen and a person who is not alive cannot be killed.

 
You start from an incorrect premis- they do not claim the deserve, they do deserve.

 

Based on what grounds? They have never had a state at any time in history, why now? Do I deserve a state of my own just because I say I do? Do I have a legitimate claim against the blacks in South Africa who forced me to flee the targeted attacks of white people post 1994? Can I claim refugee status?

 
Start in the West Bank, remove the settlements and share the water on a equitable per capita basis. Gaza is a basket case and not ready for effective self government.

 

NO! You are ignoring the elephant in the room! We have tried giving them land and autonomous rule in Gaza. They need to fix their problems there before they can demand more! We offered land for peace - they got land, what did we get? Sort out Gaza then we can talk about the West Bank.

 
If you deny them the vote but give it to Jews (I assume you disenfranchise Israeli-Arabs) you set up an apathied regime in violation of intenrational law.

 

You quoted my idea of a pledge of allegiance for all so I am not sure how that is relevant. Either way, I have serious issue with this liberal nonsense of creating such open interpretations for genocide and apartheid.

While it would be wonderful to live in a world where we all hold hands and laugh heartily, that is not reality but to slap heinous labels on relatively innocent people is to discredit the whole of humanity while allowing those who are really committing horrible crimes to get away with it.

Fortunately for you and unfortunately for me, we live in a liberal bleeding heart world where everyone who wants to be a victim can just sign up for some stupid poorly thought out cause and have the whole world stand behind them because they fit 1 out of 65 rules.

Srawman and utterly false. War does not change treaty obligations relating to the laws and customs of war (4GC).

Do I have a legitimate claim against the blacks in South Africa who forced me to flee the targeted attacks of white people post 1994? Can I claim refugee status?
 

The possession of a state is not grounds for political legitimacy. The Jews had not had a state in over 2000 years- why do they get one now? As genetic testing shows, the Palestinians have the same ancient roots to the land as the Shepardik Jews and stronger ties than the two other main Jewish groups.

 
NO! You are ignoring the elephant in the room! We have tried giving them land and autonomous rule in Gaza. They need to fix their problems there before they can demand more! We offered land for peace - they got land, what did we get? Sort out Gaza then we can talk about the West Bank.
 

Gaza is not under PA control and is not subject to an illegal occupation and enforced ghettos- the West Bank is. Nor does fixing their own problems absolve israel since the settlements are illegal and Israel has treaty obligations to the Palestinian people as an occupying power.

 
You quoted my idea of a pledge of allegiance for all so I am not sure how that is relevant. Either way, I have serious issue with this liberal nonsense of creating such open interpretations for genocide and apartheid.

The fact remains that the people in position of power made decisions. Those who wanted power did too. They miscalculated their chances of victory and lost. Israel need not apologize for this.

Your ability to tag my arguments as logical fallacies makes you a fine rhetorician. However, it does not change the facts. Your argument sounds like a broken record. What you can avoid answering, you avoid, what you can't avoid, you slap with a logical fallacy label or quote some slanted "facts".

Let's say that Israel gives up the West Bank and a Palestinian state is formed tomorrow. Then what? You expect peace to suddenly arrive? What were your thoughts at the time of the disengagement from Gaza? And what makes you think the exact same situation won't occur tomorrow.

I can see the West Bank from my window. If the same forces who shoot rockets from Gaza move into the West Bank, they will be able to hit my home. Its very easy for you to play diplomacy from the U.S. when your life is not on the line my friend. When was the last time your house was in range of a rocket attack?

The fact remains that the people in position of power made decisions. Those who wanted power did too. They miscalculated their chances of victory and lost. Israel need not apologize for this.
 

Again strawman. No one is talking about land lawfully won through defensive war. The Palestinians were willing and active participants in the partition war. They choose aggressive war as a solution to what they felt was an unjust partition plan and they lost. That is not a matter of debate. However the Palestinians were not actors in 1967 and Jordan did not have legal rights to the West Bank and Egypt did not have legal rights to Gaza. The West Bank and Gaza are thus occupied territories and Israel has obligations to them as a result of treaties she signed. These are absolute, they do not depend on what others do since the 4th CG and UN Charter are not reciprocal in nature. Likewise Israel's liability under international law and norms even when not a signatory either through the obligations incurred by successor states or treaties/customs being so wide spread as to assume a universal character do not depend on what others do.

 
Your ability to tag my arguments as logical fallacies makes you a fine rhetorician. However, it does not change the facts. Your argument sounds like a broken record. What you can avoid answering, you avoid, what you can't avoid, you slap with a logical fallacy label or quote some slanted "facts".
 

That would be an ad hominem. I dare you to show where I have avoid anything. Or where I have posted slanted facts? The sources I use are either Israeli, neutral in character or international agreements.

You seem to be the one who is avoiding.

 
Let's say that Israel gives up the West Bank and a Palestinian state is formed tomorrow. Then what? You expect peace to suddenly arrive?
 

if it occurred tommorrow chaos would result. This would accurately reflect Israel's failings as an occupying power to build the robust social institutions the West Bank needs to secure peace for both people. The withdrawal needs to be vigorous but staged. The settlers need to go first and go now. Then as Palestinian social institutions, economic prospects and political stability increase the Israeli military could begin a phased pull out until either fully removed or a SOFA was reached that was mutually acceptable to both parties.

 
What were your thoughts at the time of the disengagement from Gaza? And what makes you think the exact same situation won't occur tomorrow.
 

I think the violence was predictable given the lack of robust social institutions, poor economic prospects and the lack of real autonomy acted as incentives for groups like Hamas to pursue violence.

 
I can see the West Bank from my window. If the same forces who shoot rockets from Gaza move into the West Bank, they will be able to hit my home. Its very easy for you to play diplomacy from the U.S. when your life is not on the line my friend. When was the last time your house was in range of a rocket attack?
 

That depends.

If we go by where I was then offically 1994 when Russia and the US agreed to stop targeting each other. Washington's which is located Puget Sound is a major nuclear target- Bangor, Bremerton, Whidbey Island, Vancouver Island and Everett naval bases/areas. Ft Lewis army bases and McCord AFB.

If you mean where my home is now, 1987 when the Titan II missile was pulled from the ground less than a mile from my house.

If you mean terrorism not rockets, the threat is on going. An Islamist is currently on trial here for a terror attack on an Army recruiting station 25 miles from where I live.
 
 
 
 

Here is a picture of a strawman. I am sure it will help your argument.

 

When did you stop treating Palestianean baby girls as real human beings?

No, scratch that. I don't want to know your answer. Your answer is obvious enough. I don't want to spend my remaining days to show you your errors. I rather now leave that to higher powers (and I do not mean your Parliment nor your Courts).

Colonel, how did you come to that conclusion from a picture that at worst is out of place in this debate?

Adam:

They say a picture is worth a thousand words, but sometime they can be ambiguous. I doubt you meant to offend anyone, but if you can see how you might have, then nothing more needs to be said...

NB We have a lot of threads relevant to your part of the world. Give them a visit sometime. Always good to get a new perspective.

I really cannot see how it is offensive. I just wanted to lighten up the somber mood of the argument. Not sure how its related to my not treating Palestinian baby girls as real human beings (whatever the hell that means?)
 
 
Adam,

For how long can Israel continue with the current status quo ?

By status quo i mean, either continuing to build more settlements or initiating a freeze but without reconciling with the Palestinians.

Do you believe in the demographics argument, that there will be increasing pressure for Israel to act or otherwise become a minority in the land. I'm not sure how Israel is under a threat even in this case so long as they hold onto power. The power to protect and uphold present Israeli law & aspirations.

Another way of putting it is what incentive does Israel have to make any concessions whatsoever in the present scenario.

 
NB We have a lot of threads relevant to your part of the world. Give them a visit sometime. Always good to get a new perspective.

 

Yeah, i wish there were more Israeli's here.

*hint* hint**nudge nudge* *wink wink* Ben  

You do an outstanding job all by yourself.
 
 
I meant to get back to this a while ago. I'll try to avoid duplicating stuff dealt with subsequently

 
1)My perfect world depends on how many years back we go. If its 1948, we stick with the original plan. Jews get their own state, Arabs get their own state, each respects each other and there is no need for countless lives lost.

Given the situation we have today, if we choose not to go back and change anything. All Arab nations must immediately recognize the state of Israel, outlaw antiSemitic propaganda (like in Germany) and work towards achieving normalized ties with Israel. Gaza should be established as the first stronghold for the dispersed people. Arab nations should have monitors in the area to ensure that there is no chance of terrorist organizations seizing power. Egypt should open her borders fully and allow aid in. Once this happens and it can be seen that it is sustainable, Israeli could open trade routes and move towards a similar model in the West Bank.

 

....and ?

For someone who clearly has no trouble expressing himself, this seems curiously opaque. In fact, it seems to avoid most of the major issues I would expect such a response to deal with. Does the land remain under Israeli occupation? Do the settlements keep expanding? When (if ever) do they stop? Do the Palestineans (they think they exist, and since they've mostly been there longer than you I'll take thier word for it) get a state? Does the terrotiry become part of an Israeli state?

 
In regards to your second question. Nowhere in my blog did I write that "diasporan jews who disagree with your opinion are 'worse than kapos'". I did however say that American Jews who call themselves Zionists, benefit from free trips to Israel on programs such as Nefesh b Nefesh and the like and claim to love Israel are hypocrites if they then turn around and bash Israeli foreign policy because its en vogue. One either supports Israel's right to exist or they do not, it cannot be both ways.
 

few points:

* What about non-American Zionists elsewhere in the diaspora? Can they criticize Israeli foreign policy (or other policies) without being 'worse than kapos'?
* Is it necessary to support settlements in order to be a Zionist?
* Is it necessary to support anti-Arab racism to be a Zionist?
* Which particular Israeli policies can be criticized without being 'worse than a kapo'? Can you criticize the Barak or Olmert peace plans?
* Why do you equate opposition to settlements to opposing Israel's right to exist?

 
My usage of the word kapo is to contrast that while kapos were forced to turn on their people to save their own lives, these so called Zionists have no such life threatening situation - my words were taken completely out of context.
 

The context of your words was very clear, despite subsequent attempts to rationalize it. You have chosen to compare Zionists who oppose expanding settlements to people who directy assisted the physical extermination of other Jews. You are plenty bright enough to have found a less offensive comparison had you chosen to. The fact that your instinct was to equate opposition to settlements to the holocaust is telling.

 
Any non-Israeli Jew who completely rejects Israel and takes the side of the Arabs may be a traitor in my eyes, but at least they have integrity and are not hypocrites.
 

...and how does this relate to opposing settlements or anti-Arab racism ?

 
3) I have no qualms with gentiles. In fact, I think we get more support from gentiles than we do from diaspora Jews. This is not a battle for gentiles (not on a micro-level at least) and so I don't think they owe me a damned thing. If a gentile wants to hate me or love me, that is great, I owe them nothing and vice-versa. The point made in the blog was that the Arabs have such a powerful message because as much as they might kill each other, they will never delegitimize the cause of their brothers against a common perceived enemy.
 

....um...OK.

 
At the end of the day, my "speech" was about sticking together as a nation, like the Arabs do. If you claim to be a Zionist, act like a Zionist to the end, don;t take the best bits while trying to establish some "holier-than-thou" aura in order to appease those around you with a different opinion. And don't walk into Zionisms back yard and start preaching what it is to be a true Zionist.
 

'the Arabs' stick together? Don't Israelis delight in pointing out how badly Arabs treat each other & how they use Palestineans (sorry...they still exist) for their own ends but really don't care about them?

 
Unfortunately the discussion was hijacked, as usual, and turned into "Israel bad, Arabs, poor sad lonely Arabs". When I get told I am trolling because I have a difference of opinion, that kind of thing just pisses me off. You can't have a logical discussion when the truth is immaterial to the conversation.
 

Sorry Adam, but your committment to 'logic' and 'truth' is occasional, self-serving & transparently tactical. If it weren't then you wouldn't defend your right to quote demonstrably inaccurate figures from a pro-LTTE group & then spin around & refuse to accept anything with 'UN attached to it.

To be honest, your arguments remind me of nothing so much as the clever philosophy student who proves that the world doesn't really exist - cleverly constructed, but ultimately empty. You want to de-legitimize those best placed to undermine your view of the world. Thats fine, but lets call it for what it is, rather than pretend it is about 'logic' or 'truth'.

Again, you can use the Strawman argument as much as you want, its completely irrelevant because I am not attacking your position, I am purely discrediting your facts with others.

Yes the Palestinians were willing and active participants because they were the Jews who were living in the area at the time. Palestinians and Arab/Muslim are not mutually exclusive so if anything it was a civil war which one side won.

Who, in your opinion, owns the land? Does Gaza belong to The Ottomans? The British? The West Bank which was known as Judea and Samaria before 1948, sounds pretty Jewish to me... Well who owns that land? Do the Aborigines own Australia? Do the Native Americans own the United States? Do the Inuit own Alaska? Do the Polynesians own Hawaii?

Not Ad Hominem - You asked me to show you where it was written that ICRC were harboring terrorists. I sent you an article that indicates that several Hamas legislators have pitched tent in the ICRC headquarters in Jerusalem. Hamas is a known terrorist organization. The 3 legislators have been in prison in Israel before and are believed to have been involved in or have knowledge of the Gilad Shalit situation. You chose to ignore this argument.

The internet allows you to find whatever you want - you are looking for proof that Israel is in the wrong, you will find it. But your sources are biased. I am not sure if experimenter's bias is a logical fallacy but you will find that the research in question often misconstrues data in order to comply with the research hypothesis.

If Israel were actively trying to wipe out the Palestinians, we would not be stupid enough to spend billions trying to make it look like we aren't. Again, if you look at how the IDF operates, we have one of the most humane armies in the world. We are trying our best to deal with the situation that has been dumped on us. Nobody seems to have expectations from the surrounding Arab nations who are just as responsible for the situation. Egypt has blockaded Gaza as well and there hasn't been a peep.

Please explain why it is Israel's responsibility alone to build social institution. How can we even begin to start talking peace with them if they can't even make peace with each other. They are in the middle of a civil war which needs to be sorted out before any external issues are resolved.

How much time, money and resources do you expect Israel to give for the formation of a state in the West Bank and what are the Arab responsibilities in this situation. Does the Khartoum Resolution stand and why is "Palestinian" only used in reference to the people and not the land? If the land belongs to the Arabs who are allowing the Palestinians their own country there, we have a completely different argument.

So the violence in Gaza was predictable? You're telling me that you think that all the world leaders who had influence on this situation knew that the rockets would be fired the second that Gaza was "freed"? They knew that the Palestinians would vote Hamas in? I am sorry if this comes across as ad hominem but if you know so much better, why are you not the head of a think tank that's saving the world one occupation at a time?

With all due respect, hindsight is always 20/20. You can say it was predictable but given the circumstances at the time, Gaza was a step towards peace. It was a unilateral decision, it was done at the expense of the Israeli people, Israeli citizens, (some of whom were Palestinians, meaning they had every right to be there) were evicted from their homes resulting in what almost became a civil war. We did this as a gesture to show that we meant business. We left an oasis with orchards, infrastructure, running water. The international reaction was positive (  Israel's unilateral disengagement plan - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia  ).

The Palestinians moved in, burned down synagogues, ripped the infrastructure to pieces and voted in a terrorist organization who proceeded to kill members of Fatah. They enforced Sharia law and de facto state sponsored terrorism arose in a de facto state. This is not speculation, this happened and it happened because the Palestinians are not ready to live in peace with Israel - they have proven this with their actions and their vote. They need to sort their own civil issues out, get rid of Hamas and dissolve the PA to create a new unified movement and a true partner for peace. Once that happens we can talk.

Your argument for being close to enemy rocket attack is great if its 1994 or 1987 but its not. It is 2011 and there was a rocket attack on Israeli homes 9 days ago.
 
 
 
Again, you can use the Strawman argument as much as you want, its completely irrelevant because I am not attacking your position, I am purely discrediting your facts with others.

 

You have not presented facts.

 
Yes the Palestinians were willing and active participants because they were the Jews who were living in the area at the time. Palestinians and Arab/Muslim are not mutually exclusive so if anything it was a civil war which one side won.
 

In 1967 the Palestinians were not party to the war.

 
Who, in your opinion, owns the land? Does Gaza belong to The Ottomans? The British? The West Bank which was known as Judea and Samaria before 1948, sounds pretty Jewish to me... Well who owns that land? Do the Aborigines own Australia? Do the Native Americans own the United States? Do the Inuit own Alaska? Do the Polynesians own Hawaii?
 

The Palestinians own the West Bank and Gaza per treaty Isreal is party to.

 
Not Ad Hominem - You asked me to show you where it was written that ICRC were harboring terrorists. I sent you an article that indicates that several Hamas legislators have pitched tent in the ICRC headquarters in Jerusalem. Hamas is a known terrorist organization. The 3 legislators have been in prison in Israel before and are believed to have been involved in or have knowledge of the Gilad Shalit situation. You chose to ignore this argument.
 

They have been in prison and accused of knowing where Gilad Shalit is. The world is supposed to ignore the fact that Gilad Shalit was captured in Gaza and the 3 legislators are in Jresusalem. Nor is the ICRC harboeign them, they notified Israel and Israel could arrest them at any time.

 
The internet allows you to find whatever you want - you are looking for proof that Israel is in the wrong, you will find it. But your sources are biased. I am not sure if experimenter's bias is a logical fallacy but you will find that the research in question often misconstrues data in order to comply with the research hypothesis.
 

I am using credible sources often your sources.

If you refuse to admit that the behavior of Israel is a violation of her treaty obligations there is no point in wasting more bandwidth.

 
Please explain why it is Israel's responsibility alone to build social institution. How can we even begin to start talking peace with them if they can't even make peace with each other. They are in the middle of a civil war which needs to be sorted out before any external issues are resolved.
 

It is Israel's responsability by treaty and international law. The civil war is a result of Israeli action as well.

 
How much time, money and resources do you expect Israel to give for the formation of a state in the West Bank and what are the Arab responsibilities in this situation. Does the Khartoum Resolution stand and why is "Palestinian" only used in reference to the people and not the land? If the land belongs to the Arabs who are allowing the Palestinians their own country there, we have a completely different argument.
 

The law which Israel is boud to by her own free will signature to international treaties makes it her responsability.

You're telling me that you think that all the world leaders who had influence on this situation knew that the rockets would be fired the second that Gaza was "freed"?

I am sorry if this comes across as ad hominem but if you know so much better, why are you not the head of a think tank that's saving the world one occupation at a time?
 

Yes the violence was predictable, violence is a natural outgrowth of economic deprivation and a loss of political hope in the midst of a power vacuum.

 
With all due respect, hindsight is always 20/20. You can say it was predictable but given the circumstances at the time, Gaza was a step towards peace. It was a unilateral decision, it was done at the expense of the Israeli people, Israeli citizens, (some of whom were Palestinians, meaning they had every right to be there) were evicted from their homes resulting in what almost became a civil war.

No Israeli had a right to be there- it was occupied territory. The pull out did not cost the Israeli people one shekel's worth of stuff they had a legal right to.

 
The Palestinians moved in, burned down synagogues, ripped the infrastructure to pieces and voted in a terrorist organization who proceeded to kill members of Fatah. They enforced Sharia law and de facto state sponsored terrorism arose in a de facto state. This is not speculation, this happened and it happened because the Palestinians are not ready to live in peace with Israel - they have proven this with their actions and their vote. They need to sort their own civil issues out, get rid of Hamas and dissolve the PA to create a new unified movement and a true partner for peace. Once that happens we can talk.
 

No they don't, Israel is the least trust worthy peace partner in the world. Israel demands things from others she is not willing to give in return, violates international laws on war, peace and humanity and then has the chutzpah to call herself the victim.

 
Your argument for being close to enemy rocket attack is great if its 1994 or 1987 but its not. It is 2011 and there was a rocket attack on Israeli homes 9 days ago.
 

I know of at least 3 Palestinians who died durign that time due to Israeli action.
 
 
 
Yes it did define national denominations- Jew and Arab.

 

I see, now is "Arab". Only before you stated that "The group was called Palestinians by the UN as part of the partition plan."

So which is it?

I said is that the word "Palestinians" did not define a national denomination in Res. 181 - and I stand by my assertion.

 
The Jews settled on the name Israel, the Arabs on Palestine.
 

To make a longer story short: the Arabs did not such thing.

 
The area now known as Israel has had many names- Caanan, Israel, Judeah, Samaria, Palestine....
 

I'd like to point out that quite a few posts in this thread confuse and conflate geographical denominations (ie. Palestine) with political denominations (ie. Israel) - an elemental error that then leads to even more errors.

For example, and to touch on a contentious issue to which I may come back later: There has never been an independent Arab Palestinian State. I mean never. Ever. Therefore, and by definition, there cannot be "Palestinian land", since there never was "Palestinian" sovereignty. "Occupied" or not "occupied" - such a thing simply doesn't exist.

 
The name of the projected state was left up to the people themselves.
 

You contradict yourself again, this time in the same paragraph. Just a moment ago you said that "it did define national denominations- Jew and Arab". Now the name "was left up to the people themselves"

 
242 deals with a war between states, the Palestinian people as an occupied party were not parties to the war or its conclusion.
 

In other words, despite all the facts arguing to the contrary, "Palestinians" were a nation before 1967 because you say so, right?

Actually, the reason the "Palestinians" don't appear in 242, is because Arabs had not yet concluded that the creation of a "Palestinian" identity was the best way to oppose the political independence of the Jewish people.

That's why.

That's why the father of Arab-Palestinian nationalism, Amin al-Husseiny, was first pan-Syrian and then "Palestinian". That's why there wasn't any serious independence movement among what we today call "Palestinians" when Jordan annexed the West Bank. That explains why the PLO was created as recently as 1964, why no less than its first Chairman had declared just a few years before that "Palestine" was Syria, and explains the Article 24 of the PLO's original Covenant, which states:

this Organization (the PLO) does not exercise any regional sovereignty over the West Bank in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, in the Gaza Strip or the Himmah area.
 
 
 
Adam,

For how long can Israel continue with the current status quo ?

By status quo i mean, either continuing to build more settlements or initiating a freeze but without reconciling with the Palestinians.

Do you believe in the demographics argument, that there will be increasing pressure for Israel to act or otherwise become a minority in the land. I'm not sure how Israel is under a threat even in this case so long as they hold onto power. The power to protect and uphold present Israeli law & aspirations.

Another way of putting it is what incentive does Israel have to make any concessions whatsoever in the present scenario.

Yeah, i wish there were more Israeli's here.

*hint* hint**nudge nudge* *wink wink* Ben  

You do an outstanding job all by yourself.

 

Thanks for the backup! I wish there were more pro-Israel voices too. Ben is being surprisingly quiet considering we normally have to beg him to shut up  

The demographics argument shouldn't really be an issue. The fact is that the British Mandate of Palestine was to be partitioned into two - One part for Jews, the other part for Arabs. This did indeed happen - Jordan was founded in 1946 and Israel in 1948. That is the two-state solution.

I believe that the world should recognize that this is indeed the case and that there is no need for a third Arab state in the area that the mandate covered. If you look at the Palestinian flag and coat of arms, they are remarkably similar to that of the Jordanian flag and coat of arms. Given the examples of quotes from prominent Arab leaders about the legitimacy of the Palestinians people. The Palestinians are nothing but a Red Herring that diverts attention from the real intentions of the Arab nations, to weaken and ultimately destroy the state of Israel.

Be that as it may, we are facing a different situation today. I do not believe Israel has any incentive to give an inch of land away. The international community has not provided incentive, nor have the Arab nations, nor have the Palestinians. Unfortunately, this situation will continue in to spiral out of control until a true partner for peace emerges. I don't want to live in the West Bank, I don't want to live in Gaza and I am sure I am not in the minority. They can have the land for all I care but I want to know that I will be safe to live in peace without worrying about rocket fire, abductions and suicide bombings.

Israel's military campaigns, for the most part, work. Our "apartheid fence" has stopped the suicide bombings, our campaigns in Southern Lebanon and Gaza have limited the rocket fire. When we give the Palestinians any amount of leeway, they use it for violence against us instead of constructively for their people.

The settlements are built on land that Israel either owns, or has been acquired through war and armistice agreements. They also provide an extended buffer zone and front line for battle. They risk their lives to protect the people in the center. We have no reason to freeze our natural growth, we get nothing in return and we set a precedent for pointless dead-end negotiations. The Arabs walk in and expect us to give 100% before they consider a peace deal, how about a 1:1 ratio of land for peace? Let's start with Gaza, we'll move on from there but until we see an improved relationship based on those concessions, we don't need to give another thing.

Ultimately, as the Arab populations in Israel grow, something will have to be done to preserve the Jewish identity of the state. As I recommended, Arabs should have full rights short of being able to majorly influence government. That's not a bad trade off compared to what they are currently subjected to by their own people. Thus the reason Jordan is rescinding citizenship.
 
 
Adam, I'm still here, I'm staying more on the sidelines for this one, since you're doing a better job than I could, anyway. I'd have agreed to disagree ages ago...  

However, since you asked: (Courtesy of Isaac)

 Poll: Jerusalem Arabs Prefer Israel 

 
Poll: Jerusalem Arabs prefer Israel

US poll: 39% of east Jerusalem Arabs prefer to live under Israeli sovereignty; 30% didn't answer

Yitzhak Benhorin
Published: 01.13.11, 00:31 / Israel News

WASHINGTON – The future of Jerusalem is considered one of the core issues in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and one of the most significant obstacles to a permanent agreement between the two sides. However, it appears that on the Palestinian side, those who live in Jerusalem have already made their decision on the matter – and the Palestinian Authority leadership in Ramallah may not like it.

A public opinion poll carried out by American Pechter Middle East Polls for the Council on Foreign Relations together with the head of the Palestinian Center for Public Opinion, Dr. Nabil Kukali, showed that if Jerusalem were divided as part of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, east Jerusalem Arabs would prefer to live under Israeli sovereignty.

The poll, which comprised the residents of east Jerusalem's 19 Arab neighborhoods, also pointed out that their opposition to Jerusalem's division is so intense that they would rather move to a new home within Israel's borders rather than live under the authority of a Palestinian state.

The study also showed that Jerusalem's Palestinian residents were interested in keeping their Israeli Identity cards and enjoying the State's health and social benefits. Some 35% of them said that Israeli citizenship is their preferred citizenship and only 30% chose to be citizens of the future Palestinian state. An additional 30% said that they didn't know, or preferred not to answer the question.

And what would the neighbors say? When asked "if most people in your neighborhood” would prefer to become citizens of Palestine or of Israel: 31% estimated that most people prefer Palestinian citizenship; 39% estimated that most people prefer Israeli citizenship; and 30% declined to answer or said they didn’t know.

It would seem that the residents of east Jerusalem are willing to pay a high price in order to carry the blue Israeli identity card: 40% said they would move in order to remain Israeli citizens if their neighborhood was transferred to Palestinian sovereignty. In contrast, only 29% said that if the opposite were to occur, and their neighborhood remained under Israel's authority they would move to an area under Palestinian authority.

In addition to the social benefits, those who chose Israeli citizenship most often mentioned freedom of movement in Israel, higher income and better job opportunities. Those who chose Palestinian citizenship overwhelmingly cited nationalism and patriotic reasons as their primary motivation.
 
 
 
 
I really cannot see how it is offensive. I just wanted to lighten up the somber mood of the argument. Not sure how its related to my not treating Palestinian baby girls as real human beings (whatever the hell that means?)

 

Good you meant no offense. But keep in mind that lightening up the mood of a discussion can also have the effect of making light of it.

Let's all respect Voltaire's maxim: "Think for yourselves and let others enjoy the privilege to do so too.''
 
 
Adam, thank you for this post, finally something meaty I can sink my teeth into.

 
The demographics argument shouldn't really be an issue. The fact is that the British Mandate of Palestine was to be partitioned into two - One part for Jews, the other part for Arabs.

 

This is truth

 
This did indeed happen - Jordan was founded in 1946 and Israel in 1948. That is the two-state solution.
 

This is untruth.

Transjordan was excised from Palestine in 1921. The land of transjordan became the kingdom of Jordan in 1946 a year before the partition plan. Thus the discussion of dividing Palestine can only refer to the area known as Mandate Palestine from 1921-47

 
I believe that the world should recognize that this is indeed the case and that there is no need for a third Arab state in the area that the mandate covered.
 

You would prefer the world recognize an untruth?

 
If you look at the Palestinian flag and coat of arms, they are remarkably similar to that of the Jordanian flag and coat of arms.
 

Lots of flags and coats or arms are simialr, simialr is not the same as "the same".

 
Given the examples of quotes from prominent Arab leaders about the legitimacy of the Palestinians people. The Palestinians are nothing but a Red Herring that diverts attention from the real intentions of the Arab nations, to weaken and ultimately destroy the state of Israel.
 

Given that the last Arab invasion was in 1973 and the fact that Israel operates in violation of treaties she entered into of her own free will both before and after these invasions. How are the arabs trying to destry Israel? Since the last Arab invasion, Israel has invaded a neghobring country/region on a massive scale 4 times if I am not mistaken. Israel has invaded more than she has been invaded.

 
Be that as it may, we are facing a different situation today. I do not believe Israel has any incentive to give an inch of land away. The international community has not provided incentive, nor have the Arab nations, nor have the Palestinians.
 

So absolute obligations to numerous international agreements and treaties, billions in forgien aid and promises of peace are no incentive?

Do you Adam think Israel should honor her treaty commitments and abide by International Law?

 
Unfortunately, this situation will continue in to spiral out of control until a true partner for peace emerges. I don't want to live in the West Bank, I don't want to live in Gaza and I am sure I am not in the minority. They can have the land for all I care but I want to know that I will be safe to live in peace without worrying about rocket fire, abductions and suicide bombings.
 

Then pull the settlers out, unblock the roads, share the water, and spend the next ten years buildign robust social instatutions and palestinian economic prospects.

Hopwever, continue to deny them and deny Israel's legal obligations and you will continue to get strife. Its funny you claim fear of rockets which have killed what 30 people, yet have no problem with 500lbs and WP shells landing in crowded Palestinian areas. Just yesterday, Israel agreed to provide permament care for a young girl who lost her borther snad mother and was left on a ventilator from an Israeli bomb. When was the last time a Jewish family suffered tragedy of that scale?

 
Israel's military campaigns, for the most part, work. Our "apartheid fence" has stopped the suicide bombings, our campaigns in Southern Lebanon and Gaza have limited the rocket fire. When we give the Palestinians any amount of leeway, they use it for violence against us instead of constructively for their people.
 

Bottling things does not "work" it stores and in some cases magnifies. Once the cork pops and it will the result will be worse. Israel would be much better served both short and long term by embracign international law and undertaking real efforts to shape the future peace by creatign the conditions that lead to peace.

 
The settlements are built on land that Israel either owns, or has been acquired through war and armistice agreements.
 

No they are not. As I already showed you using Israeli and international law, the land remains with the people who live there despite changes of national flag (legitimately or illegtimately flown above them).

 
They also provide an extended buffer zone and front line for battle.
 

Untruth, Gaza borders Egypt and the West Bank borders Jordan and Israel has a formal peace agreement with both.

 
They risk their lives to protect the people in the center. We have no reason to freeze our natural growth,
 

That sounds dangerously like lebensraum.

 
we get nothing in return and we set a precedent for pointless dead-end negotiations. The Arabs walk in and expect us to give 100% before they consider a peace deal, how about a 1:1 ratio of land for peace? Let's start with Gaza, we'll move on from there but until we see an improved relationship based on those concessions, we don't need to give another thing.
 

Why should the Arabs give up the tiny bit of land left to them? Israel's occupation is illegal and she has no right to it. Nor can Israel say she gets nothing in return. What she gets does not matter the obligations she willingly assumed with full knowledge of the treaties in use at the time she undertook those obligations.

Nor should Israel be rewarded for violating international law as regards war and human rights.

 
Ultimately, as the Arab populations in Israel grow, something will have to be done to preserve the Jewish identity of the state. As I recommended, Arabs should have full rights short of being able to majorly influence government. That's not a bad trade off compared to what they are currently subjected to by their own people. Thus the reason Jordan is rescinding citizenship.
 

Full citizenship without the right to take part in government is not full ctizenship. What are you going to do if they press for those rights you would deny them. Earlier you mentioned the death penalty, you already deny them access to military training. I hear chilling echoes of "Töten die Schmutzigen Juden"

Also, Jordan revoked in 1986, it is not revoking now. In fact of 2 million Palestnian refugees in Jordan, less than 200,000 do not hold Jordanian citizenship and that group in post 67 war emigres who hold yellow cards.

You need to wake up Adam, your walking down the path of hatered. A path that very nearly exterminated your people in Europe.
 
 
Well, if there was any doubt until now, Godwin's law has now definitely been fulfilled.

Z, what I see as the main underlying problem in this discussion is the point of view you and Adam came in with. You are a self-admitted Social Crusader and as such see the world through a certain lens. Adam is a right wing person that is very patriotic towards his country and with good cause.

However, please don't stop this conversation because of me, I'm lovin' the back and forth, I'm learning plenty

Its been borderline for awhile now Br, and I cannot help but think that if this had been a thread where the "debate" had not been predominantly moved by "mods" then it would have been locked a long time ago............. Just my POV.

The thread started with Godwin's Law being broken- kapo.

Nor did I call him a Nazi, I am trying to warn him he is on a very dangerous slope. How many different peoples have told the Jews, "you can't live among us" and kicked them out or shoved them into ghettos? Then the Christians came along and said, "you can't live among us as Jews", finally Hitler arrived and said, "You can't live".

The underlying problems as I see it. Adam feel free to correct me if I am wrong.

Adam does not believe in International Law
Adam does not believe in Israeli legal precedent
Adam does not believe Israel is beholden to treaties and obligations she willing entered into.
Adam does not believe the Palestinians are a real people deserving of rights.
Adam does not believe Israel shares any of the blame
Adam DOES believe Israel has a right to keep ill gotten gains.
Adam believes Israel is a victim
Adam does not believe in historical fact or science where it applies to the Palestinians.

In short Adam beleives only in might makes right, but only as it applies to Israel being the mighty.

I believe in international law
I believe in treaty obligations
I believe in legal precedent
I believe both the Jews and Palestinians are real people with real rights.
I believe both sides have blame
I DO NOT believe that anyone should keep ill gotten gains.
I believe Israel's historical victim hood is outweighed by her current victimization of Palestinians.
I believe in historical fact and science give both sides equal claim.

In short, I believe in the right of self determination. I would and have defended Israel when the shoe was on the other foot.

 
However, please don't stop this conversation because of me, I'm lovin' the back and forth, I'm learning plenty
 

Not a whole lot of back and forth. He won't answer the most basic of questions- are treaties willingly entered into binding?
 
 
 
Well, if there was any doubt until now, Godwin's law has now definitely been fulfilled.
 

Cases like this the comparison fits very well.

I'll ignor the inference. But FYI, no mods heavy into the discussion here have the delegated responsibility to lock it under the new scheme of things. I could, but that would be to take sides and deny those following the thread the opportunity to understand and weigh the opposing arguments, POVs etc. I have no interest in running a sterile discussion site. A little heat is ok. We're all friends here. We cool down; we go on until there's nothing left to add and no chance of changing minds.

A POV, nothing more.
No one is asking for a sterile discussion site. But when it becomes obvious that 2 parties will not back down nor even acknowledge the other POV, and "inferences" ignored, and not even addressed or pointed out, within the thread over a period of time.
Just hoping that presidents are not being set, and objectivity will prevail which has always been the case with this site.
 
 
They've talked each other out. There's been a lot of heat, a little light, and for the internet an astounding amount of civility. The rest of us can re-read it at our leisure. Personally speaking I'd only close it if some newbie troll came in and messed it up. BTW, nice to see you back posting Wayne, all the best to her indoors.

Isn't that a weakness ?

All it takes is one newbie troll to shut down a thread ! Any thread too.

...that they did not even take the trouble to contribute to and everyone that did loses

Not to worry. Pari or I would more than likely "shut down" the troll as long as the thread is still moving along.
