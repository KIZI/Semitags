This has been needed to be done since the beginning of this fiasco. A prominent Law Firm in Hawaii will assist with the subpoena of the 50 year old document if it exists. Two prominent document experts (Paul Irsay & Doug Vogt) will be there to do a attestation of the original long form. If the Hawaii Dept of Health refuses to abide by the subpoena signed by the clerk of the U.S. Federal District Court in Hawaii then we've got a problem. The document Obama released back on March 27th has been gone over and deemed a forgery by many computer document experts and also it wasn't a 50 year old piece of paper either. So by noon tomorrow on Aug 8th we should have a report how the event went. I say let's put this to rest once and for all. Come on Hawaii, open the documents for examination.

So now a federal subpoena being served is considered a conspiracy in your mind. Hmmm, did you know that a Emu is considered the dumbest bird in the world? Google it.
 
 
Soooooooo.......

Did they see it? Is it real? Are you satisfied yet?

Waiting for some kind of update from you. Oddly a quick google search didn't provide me any information about this.

Come on, USAR, show us how this conspiracy has now been proven!  
 
 
Something Republicans can do better than "Jobs Jobs Jobs".

He isn't going to like this. Somebody on Orly's side didn't show up, so she ran to court to try to get a new subpoena for tomorrow. The judge refused, and set a new hearing for 9/14/11 to see if he'll issue a new one.

I found this on another board, so I can't post a link.
 
 
So how did it go usar? You are the ulitmate troll, you reallly are.
 
 
you cementheads are making this about orly. what's the president afraid of ??

too transparent to put "i'm scared to show it" in the election brouchure ??

that's ok i will. so will hillary...

i noticed the idiot obot moderators come down here to check out their great political censorship work and gloat, nervous it might make it back to the front page ?.... it will, maybe not here.

Update on Birth Certificate court case

As promised, the lawyer who filed suit to see the original birth certificate showed up at the HI Department of Health yesterday. Predictably, she was handed a note from the HI Attorney General explaining that the records are sealed and by law cannot be released to the public. Her argument that Obama already made the document public, and thereby waived his right to privacy, fell on deaf ears.

So, lawyer Tait marched down to the federal district court and filed a motion to have the head of the Department of Health show up in court with the original birth certificate on September 14th to explain why the court should not order the document to be disclosed.

The DOH will argue that the information is private, the lawyer will offer affidavits from experts averring that the certificate released by Obama to the public is fake. The lawyer is demanding to see the original because no one can figure out how Obama obtained a Connecticut Social Security Number with a Hawaiian birth certificate. The lawyer will also reasonably argue that there is no right to privacy over a document that has been issue to the public, and that privacy cannot be used as an excuse to avoid disclosing the document pursuant to a subpoana for evidence in her Freedom of Information Act case.

Hopefully the judge in the case will compel the state to obey.

no one can figure out how Obama obtained a Connecticut Social Security Number with a Hawaiian birth certificate.

 

Why couldn't he? My birth certificate and SSN are from different states. And there doesn't have to be a correlation between the two. While usually, the first three digits correspond to the state of residence (not birth, residence) that's never been hard and fast.

Actually the first three digit corresponded to site of issuance - not birth or residence. My kids were born in Guam and we filed for them while back in the States on leave. Their numbers correspond to the SSA Office that issued them which of course was neither their place of birth nor their residence.

What about the fact that obama worked at a Baskin Robins in Oahu in 1975? He would have had to have a Hawaiian SS#...right???? It's been proven he NEVER lived in Connecticut, so how he got one from there nobody knows! If he'd been born in Hawaii, THEN moved to Connecticut, that might answer the questions....but he didn't!

Indeed, and obama started his working career working at a Baskin and Robins in Hawaii when he was a teenager, and wouldn't ya know, they can't seem to find the SS# he used... hmmm... what a coincidence. They can't find anything else about where he's from either, that isn't a cheap forgery.

Again, BC is irrelevant to the issuing of an SSN. So where his BC is from doesn't matter. But even residence does NOT mean that the 1st three digits have to match the state of residence. They usually do, but they don't have to. There's no reason why you couldn't be issued an SSN with the first 3 of another state. It's unusual, but it happens.
 
The Area Number is assigned by the geographical region. Prior to 1972, cards were issued in local Social Security offices around the country and the Area Number represented the State in which the card was issued. This did not necessarily have to be the State where the applicant lived, since a person could apply for their card in any Social Security office. Since 1972, when SSA began assigning SSNs and issuing cards centrally from Baltimore, the area number assigned has been based on the ZIP code in the mailing address provided on the application for the original Social Security card. The applicant's mailing address does not have to be the same as their place of residence. Thus, the Area Number does not necessarily represent the State of residence of the applicant, either prior to 1972 or since.

 

Source:  Social Security Administration 

And it could just have been an error: Hawaii zip codes start with a 9, Connecticut zips start with a 0. Completely plausible that someone hit the wrong button or misread and he was assigned a CT number. That's more believable than intentionally falsifying a SSN for a stete never resided in.

Wow...you obama supporters sure can come up with alot of excuses for him! What would you say if we gave you this same lame excuse if it was a conservative/republican that was having these issues??? You say it's unusual but it happens....EVERYTHING about obama is unusual!! And why would obama have a mailing address in Connecticut while living in Hawaii?

Social security did not issue that number to Obama, so a clerical error does not explain it. The number in question was issued in the mid 1970s to an elderly woman who resided in CT. Obama began using it in 1980, presumably after the rightful owner had died.

The SSA does not re-use social security numbers:

"The Social Security Administration does not reuse social security numbers. It has issued over 450 million since the start of the program, and at a use rate of about 5.5 million per year says it has enough to last several generations without reuse or changing the number of digits.[24]" Source: Social Security Administration

The most plausible explanation is that Obama converted someone else's number to his own use, and that is a criminal act for which he should be held accountable.

LMAO. Orly Taitz is handling this? I predict that this will go well..........

So, let me get this straight, she lost her motion and is now going to harass the DOH over the matter?

How long until she gets another fine? She's a shitty lawyer.

The number in question was issued in the mid 1970s to an elderly woman who resided in CT. Obama began using it in 1980, presumably after the rightful owner had died.

 

It's an elderly woman now? There was a (proven false) claim that it was a man born in 1890. What was the woman's name?

 
The most plausible explanation is that Obama converted someone else's number to his own use, and that is a criminal act for which he should be held accountable.

 

Why on earth is that the most plausible?
 
 
So where is it?

No, she was not denied, she served a subpoena on the DOH which they refused to honor.

She must be doing something right, no other lawyer has gotten this far in the quest to view the original certificate. There is a hearing in the matter on the court docket scheduled for 10AM on Sep 14th before judge Puglosi in the Hawaii federal district court.

Why would the court fine her, for what? She is not doing anything wrong.

You say it was proven false?

 

The claim that 042-68-4425 was issued to one Jean Paul Ludwig (born 1890) has been proven false, yes. That was a common claim on the internet (though I do not believe Taitz ever made that particular claim). Now you're saying it was issued to an elderly woman. What was her name?

 
Where is your proof of that the SSA issued this number to Obama? A detective hired by Taitz says different.

 

I browsed through Taitz's site and found her questioning the ssn, and claiming she had evidence from the SSA that they never issued the number to Obama, but I cannot find any such letter or evidence on her site.

ETA: ok, I found a failed computer search from the SSN Verification Service. A site that explicitly states that a failure to match name and ssn etc is not by itself grounds for adverse action against an employee (the main purpose of the site).

thats what the Obama apologists afraid of the truth always come back with.the truth scares you so much you could care less that forgery experts have concluded its a forgery or that his own grandmother swore he was born in kenya.

Let me get this straight:

Taitz served a subpoena that was endorsed by a judge to government officials which they ignored?

No other lawyer is as crazy as Taitz. Other then all the sanctions she's had against her and all the clients she's gotten into legal trouble (Connie Rhodes) and all the motions shes lost (every single one of them), you are right, she must be doing something right.
 
 
 
This has been needed to be done since the beginning of this fiasco. A prominent Law Firm in Hawaii will assist with the subpoena of the 50 year old document if it exists.

If the Hawaii Dept of Health refuses to abide by the subpoena signed by the clerk of the U.S. Federal District Court in Hawaii then we've got a problem. The document Obama released back on March 27th has been gone over and deemed a forgery by many computer document experts and also it wasn't a 50 year old piece of paper either. So by noon tomorrow on Aug 8th we should have a report how the event went. I say let's put this to rest once and for all. Come on Hawaii, open the documents for examination.

 

This is not an issue except for sick heads.
 
 
Orly (Orly?!) Taitz, the gift that keeps on giving.
 
 
 
Let me get this straight:

brilliant misdirection i will concede. imagine obama cosponsered the bill so mccain could be eligible. do you think the national security folks would allow nixon to send out the plummers then cover it up, then keep carrying the football for another two years... whoops...

 

Are you a birther, Wash? FYI: things have changed quite a bit since 1972 (that's 39 years ago for you Army guys who can't count over 30 rounds/magazine). You may want to catch up on your reading and current events.
 
 
 
 
 
Again, BC is irrelevant to the issuing of an SSN. So where his BC is from doesn't matter. But even residence does NOT mean that the 1st three digits have to match the state of residence. They usually do, but they don't have to. There's no reason why you couldn't be issued an SSN with the first 3 of another state. It's unusual, but it happens. Source:  Social Security Administration 

And it could just have been an error: Hawaii zip codes start with a 9, Connecticut zips start with a 0. Completely plausible that someone hit the wrong button or misread and he was assigned a CT number. That's more believable than intentionally falsifying a SSN for a stete never resided in.

 

Wow...you obama supporters sure can come up with alot of excuses for him! What would you say if we gave you this same lame excuse if it was a conservative/republican that was having these issues??? You say it's unusual but it happens....EVERYTHING about obama is unusual!! And why would obama have a mailing address in Connecticut while living in Hawaii?

 

you're right cj

 

The dems would care less. Only the far right lamestream so-called pubs act this stupidly.
 
 
 
 
 
Oh? and your evidence is what?

It's an elderly woman now? There was a (proven false) claim that it was a man born in 1890. What was the woman's name?

Why on earth is that the most plausible?

 

You say it was proven false?

 

The claim that 042-68-4425 was issued to one Jean Paul Ludwig (born 1890) has been proven false, yes. That was a common claim on the internet (though I do not believe Taitz ever made that particular claim). Now you're saying it was issued to an elderly woman. What was her name?

 
Where is your proof of that the SSA issued this number to Obama? A detective hired by Taitz says different.

 

I browsed through Taitz's site and found her questioning the ssn, and claiming she had evidence from the SSA that they never issued the number to Obama, but I cannot find any such letter or evidence on her site.

ETA: ok, I found a failed computer search from the SSN Verification Service. A site that explicitly states that a failure to match name and ssn etc is not by itself grounds for adverse action against an employee (the main purpose of the site).

 

The Jean Paul Ludwig story is a straw man. The detective does not say that Obama's number belonged to Ludwig. In fact, she does not know who previously had that number but she asserts that it was not origianally issued to Obama. The number was issued in March of 1977 when Obama was attending high school in Hawaii, so there is no reason why he would have received a CT SSN at the time. It's obviously not a clerical error, a HI SSN should start with 575-576 which is not even close to the first three digits of a CT number.

If you can provide a reasonable explanation how he would legitimately have a CT number Im all ears, but I can't think of any.

I do know his friend the terrorist Bill Ayers used to brag about how easily he could obtain false social security numbers for his radical friends.
 
 
Now Ayres is now being associated with this plot. Next it will be Soros and then Alinsky, then Karl Marx after that Rev. Wright then,,, The Shadow?
 
 
Is this shit still going on?

Since there is no plausible explanation why Obama would legitimately have a CT SSN one has to assume he obtained it fraudulently. I don't think its a coincidence that he is close friends with a man who was adept at obtaining fraudulent SSNs to construct false identities for his revolutionary associates. Of course this is conjecture, but when someone is perpetrating a ruse you are allowed to speculate on where the truth lies. If you have an alternate theory to explain how an individual is using a CT SSN that was issued in March of 1977 when he was residing in Hawaii and attending high school please share.
 
 
 
 
 
Update on Birth Certificate court case

As promised, the lawyer who filed suit to see the original birth certificate showed up at the HI Department of Health yesterday. Predictably, she was handed a note from the HI Attorney General explaining that the records are sealed and by law cannot be released to the public. Her argument that Obama already made the document public, and thereby waived his right to privacy, fell on deaf ears.

So, lawyer Tait marched down to the federal district court and filed a motion to have the head of the Department of Health show up in court with the original birth certificate on September 14th to explain why the court should not order the document to be disclosed.

The DOH will argue that the information is private, the lawyer will offer affidavits from experts averring that the certificate released by Obama to the public is fake. The lawyer is demanding to see the original because no one can figure out how Obama obtained a Connecticut Social Security Number with a Hawaiian birth certificate. The lawyer will also reasonably argue that there is no right to privacy over a document that has been issue to the public, and that privacy cannot be used as an excuse to avoid disclosing the document pursuant to a subpoana for evidence in her Freedom of Information Act case.

Hopefully the judge in the case will compel the state to obey.

 

LMAO. Orly Taitz is handling this? I predict that this will go well..........

So, let me get this straight, she lost her motion and is now going to harass the DOH over the matter?

How long until she gets another fine? She's a shitty lawyer.

 

No, she was not denied, she served a subpoena on the DOH which they refused to honor.

She must be doing something right, no other lawyer has gotten this far in the quest to view the original certificate. There is a hearing in the matter on the court docket scheduled for 10AM on Sep 14th before judge Puglosi in the Hawaii federal district court.

Why would the court fine her, for what? She is not doing anything wrong.

Yes. You'll need to find them a new bone to worry before they'll be willing to let go of this one.

It's obviously not a clerical error, a HI SSN should start with 575-576 which is not even close to the first three digits of a CT number.

 

But as I already pointed out, Hawaii ZIP codes start with a 9 and CT ZIP codes start with a 0. Very easy to get those confused.

In her FOIA complaint Taitz asserts that the SSN was issued to someone other than Obama, not that the SSN was never issued.

So you believe that at age 15 Obama went down to his local social security office in person (which by SSA policy he would have been required to do after the age of 12), submitted an application for a new number, and then someone at SSA headquarters who processed his request mistook his Hawaiian zip code for a Connecticut one? They would have had to mistake more than the zip code, they would also have missed the fact that his address was in Hawaii! And then compounded their incompetency by mailing out the card with the Connecticut social security number to a Hawaian address even though the number and the address to which the card is mailed are supposed to match. Sounds a little farfetched to me because I believe the SSA would have safeguards in place to prevent such an error being made.

You might hold out a little bit of room for doubt that possibly Obama - a man with left wing ties to individuals of unsavory character - may have obtained the social security number in an illegal manner. Even Birtherphobics like yourself must admit there's some grounds for suspicion. This is what the lawsuit is attempting to resolve. The suit is asking the Social Security administration to produce Obama's signed form SS-5 Request For Social Security Number. Seems like a fairly simple request and, like Obama says, people who have nothing to hide don't hide things. So stop making such a fuss and let the public take a peak just to make sure everything is on the up and up.
 
 
So let me get this right...the president has a bogus ss number and that birth announcement in Hawaiii was just a lucky guess on their part?

Really? This is what you have? Oily Taint is a goddess!
 
 
Oily taint?

What does a birth announcement in the local Honolulu paper have to do with a Connecticut social security number?  

We don't have any definitive proof until the original documents are turned over. As of right now it's hypothesis, driven by a puzzling intransigence on the part of officials to show the public what they want to see. I am not predicting that anything earthshaking will ultimately come of this, but since Tait is determined to see the original birth certificate and SSN application and pursue it legally, it is certainly worthwhile following the story. Besides, think how much you antibirthers will be able to gloat once the originals are turned over and it turns out to be much ado about nothing.

Really?  Taitz v Astrue 
 
1. AGENCY PROFFERED A FRAUDULENT STATEMENT, CLAIMING THAT SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER 042-68-4425 BELONGS TO A LIVE PERSON, WHILE IT’S OWN RECORDS SHOW, THAT THIS NUMBER WAS NEVER ASSIGNED.
The main point of dispute between the Plaintiff, Dr. Orly Taitz, ESQ and the defendant commissioner of the Social Security administration, Michael Astrue, and the Department of Justice, representing him, is refusal by the defendant to release a redacted application for the above social security number, claiming, that it is used by a live person. In the motion for summary judgment Defendant is claiming that the social security number in question belongs to a live person and the interest of privacy of this person supersedes the right of the public to know.

In her complaint and multiple subsequent motions Plaintiff provided Exhibit #2, a letter from the Social Security Verifications systems, stating that this number was never assigned. So, how can it belong to a live person, if it was never assigned?

 

I just find it funny that you're saying your own source is saying something completely different than she's saying.
 
 
Sorry bout that,

1. I always thought, from the very first day, what Obama supplied as an original BC, was indeed nothing but a fake.
2. The fact that it wasn't on old paper, was the killer.
3. And not from an old type writer.
4. Those two killed it for me, nothing gets past me folks.

No sir, she never said that. She said the SSA said issued a letter stating that Obama's SSN is an unassigned number. In the complaint in Taitz v Astrue she specifically and unequivocally alleges that the number was assigned to someone else

4. Plaintiff received a report and an affidavit from a licensed investigator and former EliteAnti Communist proliferation and Anti Organized Crime unit Scotland Yard officer NeilSankey. (Exhibit 2 A and B)Mr. Sankey¶s report and an affidavit, showed that Barack Hussein Obama, the President of the United States (hereinafter ³Obama´) is linked in the National databases to some 39 Social Security numbers and multiple addresses. Thenumber he used most often since around 1980 is 042-68-4425. According to Lexis Nexisand Choice Point this number originally was assigned to an elderly individual born in1890, who resided in CT, but was assumed by Obama from around 1980-1981.

In the motion to dismiss that you cite, she alleges the letter that the SSA issued stating that Obama's number is unassigned contradicts its response to her lawsuit wherein they allege that the number belongs to a live person, presumably Baraq Obama, and therefore the SS-5 form associated with the number can't be released.

Its a little curious how the SSA can say the number was never issued on the one hand, and on the other say that it belongs to a live person. Perhaps another clerical error?

Can't you see? It's all so fucking simple. Ayers actually knew Obama in High School and planned this whole thing. He knew that Obama would be president one day, but that he lacked a real birth certificate or a real Social Security Number. So he forged both of them. But he made a fatal error! Despite being smart enough to look 30 years down the road, he wasn't smart enough to know that if he was going to forge a social security number, he should probably forge one from the state the usurper actually lived in!

It all makes so much sense!

You are correct, birthers should have stfu when the White House issued posted a copy of his short form Certificate of Live Birth back in 2008. All that talk of fake documents and conspiracies was just nuts.  

Except the guy who provided the short form now admits IT'S A FAKE !

 'I created Obama's certification of birth' 

Phd Ron Polland manufactured the short form out of thin air. Snopes used the fake document to debunk claims that Obama was not born in the U. S. And the White House linked to it to prove the same.

When birthers maintained from the start that the short form was a fraud, they were mocked mercilessly; now that the truth is being told we come to find that their doubts and suspicions have been proven to have been absolutely 100% correct.

Now that we know the White House perpetrated a fraud with the short form, I think this seriously calls into question the long form that they have provided. It is time for Birtherphobes to stop shrieking. More than ever, we need to see the original document.

Your link doesn't work, but no matter. Those of us familiar with this subject are familiar with the cast and crew behind the BC issue.

First off, Ron Polland aka Ron Polarick is a fraud. He also is a hard core birther. So if you assumed he forged a document to help the President, you assumed wrong. This isn't a confession.

 Barackryphal: Meet Ronald Jay Polland 

It shouldn't be surprising that someone who claims they fraudulently forged a government document would be a fraud, but you birthers never cease to amaze me with your stupidity. In fact, from Corsi, to Taitz, to Polland, your deck is stacked with unsavory characters of dubious distinction. Yet, we are to believe that Obama is the criminal here (BTW, did Corsi ever explain what happened in Kenya)?

If you compare Polarik, her I mean Polland's claimed forgery with the document the White House actually released, you can find errors (check out the difference in slope in the "prima facie" line on the two). I'll leave the rest of the detective work to you (not that I have confidence you will do it.

This won't be the first time Polland has been caught in a forgery and deception. He isn't even given much credibility among the hard core birthers.

Have fun, you who build their houses upon sand.

It all makes so much sense!

 

You are correct, birthers should have stfu when the White House issued posted a copy of his short form Certificate of Live Birth back in 2008. All that talk of fake documents and conspiracies was just nuts.  

Except the guy who provided the short form now admits IT'S A FAKE !

 'I created Obama's certification of birth' 

Phd Ron Polland manufactured the short form out of thin air. Snopes used the fake document to debunk claims that Obama was not born in the U. S. And the White House linked to it to prove the same.

When birthers maintained from the start that the short form was a fraud, they were mocked mercilessly; now that the truth is being told we come to find that their doubts and suspicions have been proven to have been absolutely 100% correct.

Now that we know the White House perpetrated a fraud with the short form, I think this seriously calls into question the long form that they have provided. It is time for Birtherphobes to stop shrieking. More than ever, we need to see the original document.

 

You should try reading the article again, it does not say that Polland created the COLB released in 2008.

>>>>

 

But he created a forgery which automatically means every document is a forgery!

Or something like that.
 
 
Phew!
 
 
 
This has been needed to be done since the beginning of this fiasco.

 

NO IT HASN'T. You're a stupid fucking moron.
 
 
Sorry bout that,

 
 
Sorry bout that,

1. I always thought, from the very first day, what Obama supplied as an original BC, was indeed nothing but a fake.
2. The fact that it wasn't on old paper, was the killer.
3. And not from an old type writer.
4. Those two killed it for me, nothing gets past me folks.

Yep, a person posting on the internet, nothing gets past you.

Of course the idea that records are now stored digitally, and have been for years, and that when new copies are requested that they are printed on demand on new paper using laser printers is a fact of life.

Yep, nothing gets past you.

 

>>>>

 

1. Yes, nothing gets past me.  
2. You see, a copy is a copy, the probelm with his copy, its not typed with an old type writer, of that era.

Can't you see? It's all so fucking simple. Ayers actually knew Obama in High School and planned this whole thing. He knew that Obama would be president one day, but that he lacked a real birth certificate or a real Social Security Number. So he forged both of them. But he made a fatal error! Despite being smart enough to look 30 years down the road, he wasn't smart enough to know that if he was going to forge a social security number, he should probably forge one from the state the usurper actually lived in!

Your link doesn't work, but no matter. Those of us familiar with this subject are familiar with the cast and crew behind the BC issue.

First off, Ron Polland aka Ron Polarick is a fraud. He also is a hard core birther. So if you assumed he forged a document to help the President, you assumed wrong. This isn't a confession.

 Barackryphal: Meet Ronald Jay Polland 

It shouldn't be surprising that someone who claims they fraudulently forged a government document would be a fraud, but you birthers never cease to amaze me with your stupidity. In fact, from Corsi, to Taitz, to Polland, your deck is stacked with unsavory characters of dubious distinction. Yet, we are to believe that Obama is the criminal here (BTW, did Corsi ever explain what happened in Kenya)?

If you compare Polarik, her I mean Polland's claimed forgery with the document the White House actually released, you can find errors (check out the difference in slope in the "prima facie" line on the two). I'll leave the rest of the detective work to you (not that I have confidence you will do it.

This won't be the first time Polland has been caught in a forgery and deception. He isn't even given much credibility among the hard core birthers.

Have fun, you who build their houses upon sand.

 

Good catch GTH. Pollard is certainly a questionable character and his story must be regarded with suspicion. As of this time we cannot assume the COLB is not genuine, while still keeping an open mind. One must be careful these days about information on the Internet, as it is about as trustworthy as the left wing media propaganda machine. Henceforth, Corsi and stories on WND must be also be regarded with healthy skepticism unless cross checked against multiple sources. Lesson learned.

I do have a little more faith in the judiciary, as even in this period of decline, there are some safeguards against judicial corruption and duplicity. Ive marked my calendar for the 14th of the next month, three days beyond the 10th anniversary of the day of infamy the nation will never forget. Judge Puglosi will decide whether or not to force DOH to reveal the original birth certificate, the American people will be watching, and so will I. We can only hope the judge will do right by the public and finally help us overcome this aspect of Obamas Presidency. In these troubling times, theres more important things to worry about right now than birth certificates, Im sure youll agree.

No catch involved. I known Polland is a fraud for at least a year.

As for the hearing, is Taitz the attorney?

My advice for you, after watching this for a few years, don't hold your breath.
 
 
There is nothing to the OP here.
 
 
Hey USArmyR-tard, what happened in court yesterday??

Inquiring minds want to know.
 
 
 
 
Something Republicans can do better than "Jobs Jobs Jobs".

 

And what exactly has obama done for jobs?

 

We GOP ran on that platform in 2010, bigrebnc, and the House has failed in offering anything worthwhile. Obama is a failure as well, huh?

So time to vote against every incumbent, I am beginning to think. Sarah is a light weight, but her crony capitalism populist call to attention is exactly right.
 
 
Come on, USAR, tell us what happened in court yesterday.

Did the judge order the State of Hawaii to turn over the original birth certificate or did Orly's quest for the Holy Grail come to an end??
 
 
When is Rick Perry (born Ricardo Perez) going to show his birth certificate?
 
 
Come on, ASAR, man up and tell us what happened with Oily Taints lawsuit in Hawaii on 9/14/11.

Or are you ashamed that her Don Quixote effort fell apart, and that Mr Obama is in fact a Natural Born Citizen of the United States?

It's put up or shut up time, USArmyR-tard.

This has been needed to be done since the beginning of this fiasco. A prominent Law Firm in Hawaii will assist with the subpoena of the 50 year old document if it exists. Two prominent document experts (Paul Irsay & Doug Vogt) will be there to do a attestation of the original long form. If the Hawaii Dept of Health refuses to abide by the subpoena signed by the clerk of the U.S. Federal District Court in Hawaii then we've got a problem. The document Obama released back on March 27th has been gone over and deemed a forgery by many computer document experts and also it wasn't a 50 year old piece of paper either. So by noon tomorrow on Aug 8th we should have a report how the event went. I say let's put this to rest once and for all. Come on Hawaii, open the documents for examination.
