First lets start off by admiting the obvious.......... Cain actually has a plan. For better or for worse he has a plan. What do the others have?

Obama has a nifty slogan, Hate the.... er I mean tax the rich.
Romney has a plan, or as many could say a maze of confusion.
Perry to my knowledge still thinks he is in first place and doesnt need a plan beyond drilling for oil.
Bachmann hate Obamacare (great plan) but very shallow
Huntsman is a lib pretending to be a Republican.
Paul has crazy followers that think he is Obiwan Kenobi
Newt has lots of ideas that will never be heard.
Santorum just wants everyone to join the angry bus.

Now back to Cains plan....

First of all I believe it is a pretty solid plan and even if you dont believe it is, it could easily be tweaked to work. Of course we would need a Senate that actually does their job and not just table ideas they disagree with rather than debating them and offering counter solutions.

1. A limit or trigger point, if you will, could be instituted on income levels to protect the poorest among us.

2. Food could be exempt from the sales tax portion.

3. Money made in the black market would eventually produce taxes when it was eventually spent on non black market goods. Thus taxing money that otherwise slips below the radar.

4. The actual tax amount could and would be debated to what is deemed a fair amount.

5. Perscription medication could be exempt.

6. Corperations that currently dodge taxes would pay just like the rest of us.

7. The class envy war would be nullified because other than the poor everyone would pay based on their ability not their status.

People once insisted the Earth was flat and their were others that believed the sun orbited the Earth. When someone opposed those ideas they were laughed at. Who gets the last laugh now?

Our tax system is fucked beyond complicated. Why not work with ideas when they are presented? Simply raising taxes solves nothing other than to raise anymosity to new levels.

I dont have any idea if his plan is worked to the point that it is as good as it can be and neither do any of you. He has stated that in the next couple of weeks he will be releasing more information on the breadth of his plan. Point is lets try to make the system better rather than just look for the next partisan talking point.
 
 
I like it.
 
 
Analysts and media are tearing up Cain's 9-9-9 Plan. It's an expensive joke that will sink him.
 
 
I don't 'hate it,' I just think it's a joke.
 
 
 
I don't 'hate it,' I just think it's a joke.

 

Cain thinks he can sell the population a pizza that costs more equality. Only the morons are willing to buy.

Probably the same folks who believed that Herman Cain's tax plans were revenue neutral.
 
 
Really. What's there to hate? If it gets dummies to go on record in support of it......it is worth the few minutes it takes to understand that it is folly. Too bad the dummies will NEVER come back here and admit that they were wrong to buy into it. The heels are dug in already.

BTW.....President Obama has a plan......he's been working the plan for a few years now.

While it may or may not be, it is a starting point. Its not like Congress ever does anything revenue neutral. Has Obama been revenue neutral?

I've already said what I don't like about Cain's plan on other threads, but

"First lets start off by admiting the obvious.......... Cain actually has a plan."

I think there's actually a very strong case to be made that Cain does not have a plan:

- Cain says he has a plan, but that's not evidence in and of itself. Nixon said he had a plan to end the war in Vietnam.

- Cain has suggested that his 9-9-9 plan is not only a complete overhaul of the tax system, but an intermediate step towards a larger overhaul. Completely overhauling the federal tax system not once but twice is an extraordinarily inefficient action plan.

- Most distressingly, Cain's description of his plan keeps changing. There have been conflicting reports about the fate of deductions, excise taxes, and charitable giving under Cain's plan.

So I would say that Cain probably does not have a plan yet. Even if he does, I can't imagine that it is in a form that could be implemented (even if Cain were given total control over the federal government).

well you know this isnt true. There has been plenty of talking by both sides on the issue.

If you are going to make stuff up at least make it entertaining.
 
 
Holy shit! EVERY analysis I have seen by economists is clear. What has been released by Cain as a 999 plan is unworkable and favors the wealthy.

It is DOA.

Wouldn't that just enable them....make them have no incentive to go out and work harder? Wouldn't it mean that they are not paying their fair share? Cain's entire bullshit is that he wants the rate to be the same for everyone.

Let's see the articulation is that his plan is just plain simpleton, marketing slogans. I haven't seen an economist that thinks it is feasible yet.
 
 
9-9-9 is universally scorned and ridiculed. It would not have a prayer of passing
 
 
Oh! You require that the rebuttal be in new, formerly unwritten words! I get it.

Nobody cares enough to write it out for you........the plan is a joke. Read the links.
 
 
 FactCheck.org : Cains Fiscal Hocus Pocus 
 
 
 
So here we are 3 pages in and not one of you can articulate a position against his plan.

 

Here is what their opposition boils down to.

Under a flat tax as described by Herman Cain, Congress would lose control of the people of this nation and K street would become a ghost town. Both of those things are in direct opposition to what the big government types want. They will fight tooth and nail against any threat regardless of from whom it comes.

It really doesn't matter if it is 9-9-9 or 3-3-3 or 12-12-12 their hatred of such an attempt stems from the fact that a flat tax removes the games (many would call it corruption) that Congress plays with our taxes. They will never ever agree to losing that.

Edit: And for the record, my taxes would go up, significantly under the Cain proposal. Not only would I no longer have the itemized deductions and exemptions, but I've paid an effective rate of just under 6% for many years. Changing to Cain's plan would make it 9% of gross wages and my tax rate would obviously increase.

So you're gonna tell me... Wait, let me poise for this shit...

You're gonna tell me that you believe a guy, who has a background in retail, has really done extensive, honest research and determined that the exact correct answer is to cast aside 100+ years of tax law and replace it with "9-9-9?"

Really, is that what you think? Occums razor, doesn't it seem much more likely that it's just a 'brand,' designed to get people's attention?

I could pick apart the individual problems with this proposal, eg it would be the most regressive tax in history; It wouldn't raise enough revenue; He has not the slightest fucking clue how he would even begin to implement it... et al, et al.. But what's the point?

It's a joke!

And it will never, EVER happen! Even if he somehow wins the nomination and beats Obama, mark my words, you will NEVER see anything approaching this '9-9-9.' In fact, one of his first priorities as POTUS will be to figure out how he can RUN AWAY from the fact that he ever proposed something so patently ridiculous!
 
 
 
I don't 'hate it,' I just think it's a joke.

 

but it's simplistic and simple minded... so the "base" loves it.

do you think they'll figure out that it unfairly taxes working people. nah... it would require thought.

9-9-9 the $5 footlong of the political world.  
 
 
 
Even if he somehow wins the nomination and beats Obama

 

Which will never happen  independents, moderates, and weak democrats will never vote for Cain; and theyre the voters who elect presidents.

From something I posted earlier today on another thread:
====================================

The less money a family/individual makes, the higher the tax burden, thanks to the 9% Sales Tax. More and more Middle Class families/individuals are living check-to-check, thanks to flat wages that haven't kept up with inflation for the last three decades. Much of their expendable goes to necessities and many of those necessities would be taxable under Cain's tax plan.
According to the Department of Labor, a "typical average family" uses over 12% of their income for food. Now for simplicity, let's say their household income is the national average of $50,000. So, this family spends $6,000 on food in a year. With the 9% Sales Tax, they'll pay $540 in taxes on their food, that's a little over 1% of their income or now a total tax rate of 10%. A family whose household income of $250,000 also spends $6,000 for food and also pays out an extra $540 in taxes. That translates into.002% of their income, or now a total tax rate of 9.002% That purchase of a basic necessity translated into a full 1% increase in the Middle Class's tax rate. But the wealthy family who is five times richer realized a.002% increase in their tax rate. Equality?
Now typically a family making $250,000 probably spends more on food than the family making $50,000. But to equal the sales tax's effect on their income, the wealthier family would have to spend the unrealistic total of $30,000 on food annually. Unless everyone in the family weighs 400 pounds, that's a whole lot of food.
The wealthy come no where near the spending totals of the Middle Class, when comes to spending as a percentage of their expendable income. Necessities spending makes up a higher percentage of a Middle Classes expendable income than it does for the wealthy.
========================================

And that is what I don't like about 9-9-9! THe Middle Class's total tax rate would be higher than the uber-wealthy's. We actually have Middle Class righties still defending the wealthy, calling on Main Street America to buy cheaper foods,,,like frozen dinners! Yum? And that's healthy? Next, the Middle Class will be asked to eat out of garbage cans!

The plan would provide stability lower taxes for the job producers c-corps, small business owners and s-corps. The incentive to go over seas would one. WE WILL SEE ABOOM IN THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR! I guarantee unemployment drops into the 3s during after Cain's 2nd year in office.

The loophole closure does allow corps to post billions in profits and pay $0. Yes I mean you Obama's economic czar GE!

The middle class like me will see a GINORMOUS tax break. Even lowest income level is better since they no longer have payroll tax to pay.

This economic plan along with drill baby drill will put the US economy back on top!
 
 
Nice misrepresentation! The middle classes tax burden would significantly reduce! Does matter at all to u that this plan would create an economic boom? Or that it's really a ore precursor to the fair tax?

Well Grampa, I've posted the same post on two boards and asked for someone who is from the far right to dispute my post. And in 24 hours, no takers.
You can't label me as being from the left because I agree with various points from the right, (as well the left). I am a moderate Independent, I represent Main Street America more than anything. And like Main Street America, I'm very, very disappointed with Obama, The Dems and the GOP. I might vote for Romney if he's the GOP nominee but I prefer Huntsman because he comes very close to my beliefs.
The problem you have with this thread is, you got what you asked for and you were set to disagree with the answers anyway. Exactly, what was your point of starting this thread anyway?

it would be the most regressive tax in history; It wouldn't raise enough revenue; He has not the slightest fucking clue how he would even begin to implement it... et al, et al..

 

But I'm telling you, it would be much more productive to show you that it's a pathetic, gimmicky joke that's not really worthy of debate.

 

So because someone says it won't work and then tops it off with Cain is an idiot that's clueless I'm suddenly supposed to change my mind?

Fail hard friend.

I gave you circumstances under which the tax could be adjusted to protect the indigent. Try again?

Well Grampa, I've posted the same post on two boards and asked for someone who is from the far right to dispute my post. And in 24 hours, no takers.
You can't label me as being from the left because I agree with various points from the right, (as well the left). I am a moderate Independent, I represent Main Street America more than anything. And like Main Street America, I'm very, very disappointed with Obama, The Dems and the GOP. I might vote for Romney if he's the GOP nominee but I prefer Huntsman because he comes very close to my beliefs.
The problem you have with this thread is, you got what you asked for and you were set to disagree with the answers anyway. Exactly, what was your point of starting this thread anyway?

 

The point of this thread was to show that partisan talking points don't equate to facts and that his plan could be made to work.

I thought I made that pretty obvious in the very first post.

I may have missed your answer:

If you accept the GOP narrative that 47% of Americans pay no federal income tax, wouldn't this 9-9-9 plan then represent a tax increase on the 150,000,000+ Americans who currently supposedly are getting a free ride from Uncle Sam?

Don't mean to be redundant...but I didn't see where you answered that question from
 Herman Cains plan? 9-9-9 For those that hate it

Yes it would be technically. Finally everyone would contribute to the support of our nation rather than reaping the rewards paid for by the other half. And yes I did answer a question similar to yours earlier.

How about one from the right?

1. The idea of having both a sales tax and an income tax simultaneously at a federal level should be anethema to conservatives. Unless of course the idea of instituting new taxes is now in vogue.

2. Regardless of whether or not its "fair" which is a strictly liberal argument about taxes it will increase the tax burden on just about everyone from the middle of the middle class and below. It won't have much effect on those up to about upper middle class level and will be a major tax cut for those above that. I don't want to increase taxes on ANYBODY, which is what I thought being "conservative" entailed.

3. The "Flat business tax" may as well be called the small business destruction act, as excluding COL from allowable deductions from revenue will result in a MAJOR tax increase for small business' that have most of their revenue invested in labor.

4. How is charging people in detroit (empowerment zones) less in federal taxes than people in charlotte a "good thing"? By what constitutional mechanism does the federal government have any power to change the tax rates for people based on thier geography?

5. Since the courts have found that for business' income=profit, how does excluding costs like COL from the deductable computation from revenue to figure profit, and therefor income, square constitutionally?

9-9-9 is 9-9-nonsence. It is not well thought out, it is not a good plan, and it is not "conservative" in any way. I do support reform for broader, flatter and lower tax rates, I will not support any "change" and "hope" for the best because I don't like the current system, thats what happened in 2008 and so far... it ain't worked out real well.

1. 9+9 is far less than I'm taxed now with only the income tax.

2. Of course its an increase on the lower half that currently pay no taxes. And I'm not sure how you consider yourself a conservative if you don't think everyone should bare the responsibility of contributing to our society.

3. I own a small business and would welcome the stability of a tax plan like this. A flat rate is something that can easily be incorporated into the cost of doing business.

4. What does this shit have to do with 9-9-9?

5. Couldn't care less what some court says. Congress passes laws not our courts. A judgement based on previous tax law would be null.

My op is based in reality. The possibility of compromise. I fail to see partisanship.
 
 
 
1. 9+9 is far less than I'm taxed now with only the income tax.

 

Congrats. Does this include the tax increase of the new 9.1% sales tax?

 
2. Of course its an increase on the lower half that currently pay no taxes. And I'm not sure how you consider yourself a conservative if you don't think everyone should bare the responsibility of contributing to our society.

 

But surely you don't think people should have to pay taxes to the point of starvation? If you make less than $20K a year, should you pay 9% income tax + 9% sales tax?

 
3. I own a small business and would welcome the stability of a tax plan like this. A flat rate is something that can easily be incorporated into the cost of doing business.

 

How much would you be paying under the 9-9-9 plan? Keep in mind that you can't deduct the expense of labor or for purchases of any products made outside the United States. There's no word yet whether gasoline costs will be deductible since it's impossible to tell where the oil came from. Let's just say they're not. If you have a supplier, let's assume that supplier will pass the cost of transportation on to you.

I'm not sure what you do, so I don't want to assume too much. I don't know if you provide goods or services. I apologize if it's too personal to ask what your business takes in. On a side note, how many more people will you hire if your tax rate was 9% off the income minus the few deductions?

Edit: There's also a risk of a trade war igniting over Cain's plan. At the very least, it would violate WTO rules.

As far as my business goes I sell and install home remodeling products. At this point without all the details of its implimentation its hard to say exactly how the outcome will turn out. But I for one will not jump the gun and make broad based assumptions beyond the fact that this is a good starting point for "REAL" change.
 
 
Pimp Daddy's 999 plan will put more money in the hands of Cains Government and in the hand of Fat Cats. Designed to give tax breaks to Fat Cats and hurt the elderly, poor and minorities. Elderly who has paid their dues will have to once again pay taxes. Back door raising taxes.

as opposed to voting for change and hoping it's good?

yeah, i got this whole issue with that hopey changey thing.

The plan is not good, it is in fact worse than what we now have. If it is complete as cain claims, it is not well thought out as he asserts. If it is not complete, then it can't be well thought out. Either way this plan is crap.

Beheading the patient won't do them any good.

I apologize.

So there is a tax increase on the poor who currently, if you believe the rhetoric, pay zero dollars of federal income tax.

Next question. This tax increase is in addition to any state and local sales taxes that are being paid right? The new federal sales tax is not going to replace local and state sales taxes, are they? What about State income taxes...will the 9-9-9 plan replace State income taxes?
 
 
 
YOU need to get out of the box of thinking of the OLD system. I know it's hard for some of you...but at least try?

 

The system isn't different enough that the old rules don't apply. Especially the international rules, which won't be changed.

 
Read the op before you blindly attack. I clearly said their should be a trigger point to protect the indigent.

But I for one will not jump the gun and make broad based assumptions beyond the fact that this is a good starting point for "REAL" change.

 

I wasn't attacking. I did read the opening post; I just wanted to ask you some questions about Cain's plan as it is written now because you said you were a small business owner.

On the opening post:
1) What would a good trigger point be? Cain also talks about his plan being revenue neutral, so would it have to be a 9.5/10-10-10 plan if you keep some kind of minimum deduction.
2) Exempting food from sales tax makes sense, but there are quite a lot of other living expenses. I guess poor people don't need new clothes, but poor kids do need school supplies, etc.
3) Wouldn't that be better if there was no black market in the first place?
4) OK.
5) Makes sense. What about other meds? A lot of it is tax free (depending on the state).
6) That would be good. But some deductions are a lot more worthy than others--primarily the cost of labor.
7) A flat 9% isn't asking for payment on ability or status. It's fairer in the sense that it's flatter, but it doesn't ask for money based on ability to pay.

OK, I think I addressed that. Now, I'll go into my primary criticism of Cain's 9-9-9 plan. It would be a disaster for many companies. It would be a disaster in that businesses that lose money would have to pay 9% tax (minus the cost of purchases). It would absolutely increase layoffs in all but the biggest companies. Most small businesses would see their income tax rate go down, but their actual taxes paid go up since they couldn't deduct most of the cost of doing business. It would be a disaster for American manufacturers that either buy raw materials/technology from overseas or sell products overseas.

I agree with the idea of completely overhauling the tax code. I just don't like 9-9-9 how it is presently constructed. Here's a fact to partially support Cain's plan in a different form--the U.S. has one of the highest corporate tax rates nominally, but collects one of the smallest amounts of revenue as a percentage of GDP since most of the corporate taxes can be deducted. Clearly that means that there are distortionary taxes and tax breaks in the code that need to be removed. General Electric, oil companies and many more exploit breaks that smaller companies cannot.

Are your home remodeling products made in the U.S. or overseas? (I keep hammering this one aspect of Cain's plan because I find it to be a shallow appeal to "buy American" populism that's just plain dumb. What scares me more about the dumb aspects of Cain's plan is that everything I know about the guy makes me think that he isn't dumb.)
 
 
Can we start a discussion on what we're getting for 9-9-9? I'm really trying to understand it from the gut level. The website, of course, says it solves a lot of problems--what do you expect.

What are WE getting for 9-9-9? The status quo of services? Increased services? Decreased services? If so, what are going to be the additions/cutbacks under 9-9-9. If we're talking massive cuts in Military R&D and shelving new weapons systems, I'm all ears.

I'd like to hear from Cain supporters especially so I'm not getting the warts-only assessment.

LOL AS if you have any credibility, Especially being democrat.
 
 
 
First lets start off by admiting the obvious.......... Cain actually has a plan. For better or for worse he has a plan. What do the others have?

 

If I had a plan to enslave your entire family would you praise it and say; "At least HE has a plan! "

Military R&D creates some impressive technological leaps and bounds. It just needs better oversight to scrap out-of-date or way-over-budget projects (unless we can sell all of those to Israel).

As for the services, it's supposed to be status quo since Cain says his plan is revenue neutral at 9.1/9.1/9.1. Others say the math doesn't add up, but I'm sure we can tinker with the rates a bit to get a revenue neutral proposal (10/10/10? 10.5/10.5/9?)

First lets start off by admiting the obvious.......... Cain actually has a plan. For better or for worse he has a plan. What do the others have?

 

If I had a plan to enslave your entire family would you praise it and say; "At least HE has a plan! "  

 

Enslave? Still paying too much?
 
 
 
 
 
5 pages and still no coherent dissent from the left beyond its too simple and can't work. You guys are lookin pretty sad.

Form a real argument and hit me with it.

 

How about one from the right?

1. The idea of having both a sales tax and an income tax simultaneously at a federal level should be anethema to conservatives. Unless of course the idea of instituting new taxes is now in vogue.

2. Regardless of whether or not its "fair" which is a strictly liberal argument about taxes it will increase the tax burden on just about everyone from the middle of the middle class and below. It won't have much effect on those up to about upper middle class level and will be a major tax cut for those above that. I don't want to increase taxes on ANYBODY, which is what I thought being "conservative" entailed.

3. The "Flat business tax" may as well be called the small business destruction act, as excluding COL from allowable deductions from revenue will result in a MAJOR tax increase for small business' that have most of their revenue invested in labor.

4. How is charging people in detroit (empowerment zones) less in federal taxes than people in charlotte a "good thing"? By what constitutional mechanism does the federal government have any power to change the tax rates for people based on thier geography?

5. Since the courts have found that for business' income=profit, how does excluding costs like COL from the deductable computation from revenue to figure profit, and therefor income, square constitutionally?

9-9-9 is 9-9-nonsence. It is not well thought out, it is not a good plan, and it is not "conservative" in any way. I do support reform for broader, flatter and lower tax rates, I will not support any "change" and "hope" for the best because I don't like the current system, thats what happened in 2008 and so far... it ain't worked out real well.

 

1. 9+9 is far less than I'm taxed now with only the income tax.

 

this is about the nation, not about you.

family of 4 earning 40K standard deductions.

pays in about 3K in payroll taxes and after exemptions, and deductions pays taxes on an AGI of about 20K resulting in aproximately 2.5K in taxes owed for a total tax bill of around 5.5K. After credits that total is likely in the 2K to 3K range. They are tax payors.

family of 4 under 9-9-9 earning 40K

total flat tax of 3.6K bringing the net down to around 36K and then a 9% sales tax when they purchase items which at 40K would likely make them paycheck to paycheck and they would spend at minimum 90% of thier net resulting in an additional tax burden of around 2.7K for a total tax bill of 6.3K. An increase in totatl taxes for thm of right arond 100%.

This sounds like a good p0lan to you?

Average small business has a net of around 10%, so on 1M in revenue they net out 10% or 100K. Since most of these business' are LLC's, subs, proprietorships or partnerships they pay their taxes at the personal level, meaning a family of 4 pays thier tax on an AGI of about 80K after deductions and credits. This results in a tax bill of around 20K

same company and family under the business flat tax (and personal flat tax)

1M in revenue resulting in a 10% real net but you are taxed on that plus the COL (which is not deductable under the 9-9-9 plan) which for most small business is about 60% of revenue. That of course includes current payroll taxes so you can subtract that portion of payroll and say COL is 52% (we'll make it 50% for simplicity) So your taxable income is no longer 100K, but 600K. Your 9% flat tax on that 700K is 54K, thats a 34K tax increase on your revenue. (still sound good?). Now lets convert the business' revenue into you personal income when you pay yourself. You got 44K left (instead of the 100K you had before) and the tax on that is about 4K. You are now as much paycheck to paycheck as your employees so your going to be paying a 9% sales tax on most of the remaining ammount making your total personal tax bill another 6.5K on top of the 54K your business allready paid.

 
2. Of course its an increase on the lower half that currently pay no taxes. And I'm not sure how you consider yourself a conservative if you don't think everyone should bare the responsibility of contributing to our society.

 

a simple flat tax or graduated flat tax on all income above poverty level would be much better. maybe it would have to be 14or 15%, but that would be very much better than this 9-9-nonsence.

 
3. I own a small business and would welcome the stability of a tax plan like this. A flat rate is something that can easily be incorporated into the cost of doing business.

 

when you figure out how to incorporate paying a 9% incometax on the COL into your profit let me know.

 
4. What does this shit have to do with 9-9-9?

 

you apparently haven't read it. You may want to go to Cain's website and actually do that... look at empowerment zones, cause that where the COL for your business will be able to be deducted from revenue.

 
5. Couldn't care less what some court says. Congress passes laws not our courts. A judgement based on previous tax law would be null.

 

LOL... too funny. No dude, has nothing to do with any previous law, for business profit=income. You deduct costs (like COL) from your revenue to figure tyour profit. 9-9-9 disallows COL as a deduction, it taxes it, it therefor is taxing something other than "profit" which according to the SCOTUS would be unconstitutional under the 16th amendment..
 
 
It's over, you crazy shallow Cain supporters better get used to it. Cain's rabid angry supporters are making Republicans looks truly stupid.

1. 9+9 is far less than I'm taxed now with only the income tax.

 

Congrats. Does this include the tax increase of the new 9.1% sales tax?

But surely you don't think people should have to pay taxes to the point of starvation? If you make less than $20K a year, should you pay 9% income tax + 9% sales tax?

 
3. I own a small business and would welcome the stability of a tax plan like this. A flat rate is something that can easily be incorporated into the cost of doing business.

 

How much would you be paying under the 9-9-9 plan? Keep in mind that you can't deduct the expense of labor or for purchases of any products made outside the United States. There's no word yet whether gasoline costs will be deductible since it's impossible to tell where the oil came from. Let's just say they're not. If you have a supplier, let's assume that supplier will pass the cost of transportation on to you.

I'm not sure what you do, so I don't want to assume too much. I don't know if you provide goods or services. I apologize if it's too personal to ask what your business takes in. On a side note, how many more people will you hire if your tax rate was 9% off the income minus the few deductions?

Edit: There's also a risk of a trade war igniting over Cain's plan. At the very least, it would violate WTO rules.

 

YOU need to get out of the box of thinking of the OLD system. I know it's hard for some of you...but at least try?

 

Oh. I'm way, way out of the box buddy. What i suggest is that you actually research the plan, it's on Cains website, and then actually DO SOME THINKING about what the ramifications of this simplistic marketting scam would be on taxes.
 
 
 
It's over, you crazy shallow Cain supporters better get used to it. Cain's rabid angry supporters are making Republicans looks truly stupid.

Read the op before you blindly attack. I clearly said their should be a trigger point to protect the indigent.

As far as my business goes I sell and install home remodeling products. At this point without all the details of its implimentation its hard to say exactly how the outcome will turn out. But I for one will not jump the gun and make broad based assumptions beyond the fact that this is a good starting point for "REAL" change.

 

Gramps... you have all the details. cain has said it complete and well thought out. All you have to do is go to his website and see the plan. Shouldn't take long, it's just a couple paragraphs.

Yeah, while being ceo of godfathers it want from 5th to 11th between him becoming ceo and stepping down. Yeah, sitting on the fed of Kansan...The very thing that 2/3rds of the people of this country opposes and hates within the Tea party and OWS. Cain sucks.

Gramps thread on these boards.

Hell Gramps even admits he does not know if it is a good or bad thing (the 999 coupon), but if you don't agree with it he attacks you.

Fact is Gramps is supporting a guy that is using the Political stage of running for President to sell books.

He also attacks everyone else on the stage with an outright lie claiming they don't have plans when reality is they all have far better plans than Cain. Cain literally has no plan then of top of that he has zero backup plan. Cain's super simplistic 9 9 9 plan already has to have deductions added here and there and the loopholes are already being created because Cain never thought it through because he has no intention of being President.

oh... I don't know, with a few tweaks I think the libs will love it.

it will be no harder to change than any other tax system, all it will take is a vote of the congress and the presidents signature. Progressivity and regressivity are meaningless to the congress' ability to manipulate the tax code... it's the power they have. And which tax code you have is irrelevant to thier ability to do it. Do anyone honestly think that just because 9-9-9 passed as 9-9-9 the congress couldn't tomorow say

"well, we're going to keep it 9-9-9 but were going to exempt all income below poverty level from the income tax, and to make up for it we're going to tax B2B purchases 9%... after all, why should they escape the sales tax when people have to pay it"?

Then the next day

"Ok, we need to make another adjustment, capital gains, dividends and interest are income, so they will be subject to the 9% income tax, and since that will bring in additional revenue we're going to use it to give a 9% sales tax exclusion credit (refundable) for those people living at up to 150% of the poverty level when they file their flat tax... still 9-9-9!!!!"

then the next day

"you know, it's just not fair that the only deduction people have is for charitable donations while business' get to deduct costs, it cost money for people to live too! So we're going to get rid of the business deductions and make thier tax as flat as anyone elses... Revenue-charitable donations!" 9-9-9 baby!!!!!!!!!!!!

then again!

"it is absolutely unfair that the poor who must by food and medicine have to pay the same tax on them as the rich do when they purchase furs and yachts, we're going to exempt food and medicine from the tax as it's to onerous on theose who are not wealthy, and were going to pay for it with a 9% wholesale tax on luxury items! after all, if you have to pay the tax at retail, why shouldn't big business have to pay it wholesale!" 9-9-9 all the way!!!!!!!!

all while maintining the 9-9-9ness!!!!
 
 
It's a better plan than I've heard out of any other republican, including Ryan.

I don't like his idea for SS though. He knows better than to advocate a plan that gives the government the authority to manage citizens' retirements.

He's not a good enough conservative though as far as I'm concerned.

Thank you for your thoughts. But I dont buy into the no intention thing. I personally chuckle at these arguments because if anyone stopped for two seconds and took their favorite pacifiers out of their mouths they would realize there isnt a plan out there that would make it through congress without revisions. I am looking for someone who will kick the table over. Our cozy compromises have us 15 trillion in debt and counting.......................
 
 
 
Holy shit! EVERY analysis I have seen by economists is clear. What has been released by Cain as a 999 plan is unworkable and favors the wealthy.

It is DOA.

 

Those Marxist propagandists you read are not "economists." What is unworkable about it?

Liberal Dictionary:

Favors the wealthy - doesn't loot the wealthy.

no not really. you are forgetting all the other taxes out there as well.oh and Cain wants to get rid of state taxes..So much for state rights, right?You realize this is giving the Feds MORE power right?

Some how i doubt you guys even thought of it this way

 

Cain has never said he wants to get rid of state taxes. There's plenty to criticize about Cain's plan without making stuff up.

Indeed. Bandaids on a patient in a full body cast. Time to get the patient on the mend. Century-old punative taxation doesn't cut it any longer.
 
 
 
Herman Cains plan? 9-9-9 For those that hate it

It ain't a matter of hate. It is just that marketing slogans does not leadership make.

 

You mean like "hope and change?"
 
 
 
 
The other taxes exist no matter what our federal tax rate is. And I have not heard Cain mention aboloshing state taxes. He cant and that would be an obsurd position

 

I thought we were beyond the days of acid trips and euphoria.

 

How does that prove Cain wants to abolish state taxes? Are you capable of a coherent argument?

I am at the site,  999 | Herman Cain for President 

But I am not seeing the boogeyman. Are you making ASSumptions?

 

well then here's the plan budy, please, take a look and tell me where I'm wrong.

 
9% Business Flat Tax
◦Gross income less all purchases from other U.S. located businesses, all capital investment, and net exports.
◦Empowerment Zones will offer deductions for the payroll of those employed in the zone
9% Individual Flat Tax.
◦Gross income less charitable deductions.
◦Empowerment Zones will offer additional deductions for those living and/or working in the zone.
9% National Sales Tax.
◦Unlike a state sales tax, which is an add-on tax that increases the price of goods and services, this is a replacement tax. It replaces taxes that are already embedded in selling prices. By replacing higher marginal rates in the production process with lower marginal rates, marginal production costs actually decline, which will lead to prices being the same or lower, not higher.

 

you seeing COL in there anywhere? Do you sell Makita saws? Sorry, not deductable--not made in the US of A!! Is the lumber you sell shipped down from Canada? So sorry man, give up the 9% you paid for it, it's just regular income not an expense. Do you have employees who cost you money? Dude, just pay the 9% labor is not deductable.

I don't have to assume anything, the plan is right there in black and white. On the other hand for you to believe that stuff does matter you have to assume a lot!!!! But hey, it's your money and you can assume any amount of it you want away.

 999 | Herman Cain for President 

This plan should be called "The small business destruction and illegal alien employment assurity act." Cause after it goes into effect unless you dealing strictly in cash from your customers and paying cash... you ain't gonna have much left.
 
 
 
and Cain would be better, how?

 

A dead carp would be better than Obama.
 
 
 
 
 
The other taxes exist no matter what our federal tax rate is. And I have not heard Cain mention aboloshing state taxes. He cant and that would be an obsurd position

 

I thought we were beyond the days of acid trips and euphoria.

 

How does that prove Cain wants to abolish state taxes? Are you capable of a coherent argument?

 

Help me out here...the Federal Sales Tax will be on top of any state and local sales taxes...right?

The Federal Income Tax of 9% across the board will be on top of any State Income taxes then, right?
 
 
 
yeah i cant find it either, so grain of salt there.
But Cains plan is nothing more than a slightly different Ryan plan that increases taxes on the poor.

 

Ryan's plan mostly addresses the spending side. Cain hasn't ever mentioned any plans to address that.
 
 
 
Wouldn't that just enable them....make them have no incentive to go out and work harder? Wouldn't it mean that they are not paying their fair share? Cain's entire bullshit is that he wants the rate to be the same for everyone.

 

Why is that bullshit? Why shouldn't everyone pay the same percentage? Don't you think everyone should have "some skin in the game?"
 
 
 
 
So here we are 3 pages in and not one of you can articulate a position against his plan.

 

Let's see the articulation is that his plan is just plain simpleton, marketing slogans. I haven't seen an economist that thinks it is feasible yet.

 

We can't help it if you're an economic ignoramus who only reads Marxist propaganda.

What's "infeasible" about it? I've read economists who have objections to it, but not on the grounds that it's "infeasible."
 
 
 
 
 
It doesn't matter, Cain win or lose, this plan will NEVER see the light of day.

I can't believe there's actually pseudo-intellectuals here who give genuine credence to such a shameless gimmick.

 

oh... I don't know, with a few tweaks I think the libs will love it.

Then the next day

"Ok, we need to make another adjustment, capital gains, dividends and interest are income, so they will be subject to the 9% income tax, and since that will bring in additional revenue we're going to use it to give a 9% sales tax exclusion credit (refundable) for those people living at up to 150% of the poverty level when they file their flat tax... still 9-9-9!!!!"

then the next day

"you know, it's just not fair that the only deduction people have is for charitable donations while business' get to deduct costs, it cost money for people to live too! So we're going to get rid of the business deductions and make thier tax as flat as anyone elses... Revenue-charitable donations!" 9-9-9 baby!!!!!!!!!!!!

then again!

"it is absolutely unfair that the poor who must by food and medicine have to pay the same tax on them as the rich do when they purchase furs and yachts, we're going to exempt food and medicine from the tax as it's to onerous on theose who are not wealthy, and were going to pay for it with a 9% wholesale tax on luxury items! after all, if you have to pay the tax at retail, why shouldn't big business have to pay it wholesale!" 9-9-9 all the way!!!!!!!!

all while maintining the 9-9-9ness!!!!

 

I'll take "What is the bridge to the FAIRTAX for $1,000 Alex..."

16th A? Buh Bye. Gubmint tyranny? Buh Bye.

 

the fairtax is the stupidest tax scheme ever devised. Please enlighten me as to why a conservative would support a tax that has to be set 10 point artificially high so the government has the power to send EVERY FUCKING ADULT a check every month. Does that sound remotely like "shrinking the size and scope" of the federal government and getting them "out of our lives"? Getting a freakin EITC for everyone welfare check every month deisguised as a "prebate" is NOT a good idea?
 
 
 
 
 
Gramps... you have all the details. cain has said it complete and well thought out. All you have to do is go to his website and see the plan. Shouldn't take long, it's just a couple paragraphs.

 

I am at the site,  999 | for President 

But I am not seeing the boogeyman. Are you making ASSumptions?

 

well then here's the plan budy, please, take a look and tell me where I'm wrong.

 
9% Business Flat Tax
◦Gross income less all purchases from other U.S. located businesses, all capital investment, and net exports.
◦Empowerment Zones will offer deductions for the payroll of those employed in the zone
9% Individual Flat Tax.
◦Gross income less charitable deductions.
◦Empowerment Zones will offer additional deductions for those living and/or working in the zone.
9% National Sales Tax.
◦Unlike a state sales tax, which is an add-on tax that increases the price of goods and services, this is a replacement tax. It replaces taxes that are already embedded in selling prices. By replacing higher marginal rates in the production process with lower marginal rates, marginal production costs actually decline, which will lead to prices being the same or lower, not higher.

 

you seeing COL in there anywhere? Do you sell Makita saws? Sorry, not deductable--not made in the US of A!! Is the lumber you sell shipped down from Canada? So sorry man, give up the 9% you paid for it, it's just regular income not an expense. Do you have employees who cost you money? Dude, just pay the 9% labor is not deductable.

I don't have to assume anything, the plan is right there in black and white. On the other hand for you to believe that stuff does matter you have to assume a lot!!!! But hey, it's your money and you can assume any amount of it you want away.

 999 | Herman Cain for President 

This plan should be called "The small business destruction and illegal alien employment assurity act." Cause after it goes into effect unless you dealing strictly in cash from your customers and paying cash... you ain't gonna have much left.

 

First Makita saws suck. Skill Baby, second lumber form Canada is a result of the lefts policy of eliminating logging for milling at home, then lined up to sell the raw logs to china.

You are going to get to a down side arent you.

oh... I don't know, with a few tweaks I think the libs will love it.

it will be no harder to change than any other tax system, all it will take is a vote of the congress and the presidents signature. Progressivity and regressivity are meaningless to the congress' ability to manipulate the tax code... it's the power they have. And which tax code you have is irrelevant to thier ability to do it. Do anyone honestly think that just because 9-9-9 passed as 9-9-9 the congress couldn't tomorow say

"well, we're going to keep it 9-9-9 but were going to exempt all income below poverty level from the income tax, and to make up for it we're going to tax B2B purchases 9%... after all, why should they escape the sales tax when people have to pay it"?

Cain is "virtually" correct.

Now real world economists see a problem here. So as long as we stay "virtual" we'll be all right.

 

You haven't managed to quote any "real world economists" who see a problem with the plan.
 
 
 
5 pages and still no coherent dissent from the left beyond its too simple and can't work. You guys are lookin pretty sad.

Form a real argument and hit me with it.

 

In typical libturd fashion, all they can do is hurl insults.

You didn't actually believe they were capable of rational coherent thought, did you?
 
 
 
But I'm telling you, it would be much more productive to show you that it's a pathetic, gimmicky joke that's not really worthy of debate.

Well Grampa, I've posted the same post on two boards and asked for someone who is from the far right to dispute my post. And in 24 hours, no takers.
You can't label me as being from the left because I agree with various points from the right, (as well the left). I am a moderate Independent, I represent Main Street America more than anything. And like Main Street America, I'm very, very disappointed with Obama, The Dems and the GOP. I might vote for Romney if he's the GOP nominee but I prefer Huntsman because he comes very close to my beliefs.
The problem you have with this thread is, you got what you asked for and you were set to disagree with the answers anyway. Exactly, what was your point of starting this thread anyway?

 

You're about as "moderate" as Pol Pot.

Not a single libturd in here has offered up anything aside from ad hominems and unsupported accusations.

I'm sorry, but I don't buy into the false dichotomy of a choice between what we have now and the EVEN WORSE fairtax. Didn't we do change for change sake in 2008? I support reform, I do not support insanity. I would like to see the federal government shrunk in size and scope down to about 6 cabinet departments. i would like to see the budgets of those departments divided into capital and opperations budgets and would like to see 1/2 of the opperations budgets (those that have an absolute constituional underpinning) apportioned to the states, with the capital budgets voted on on a per project basis by the congress with accompanying graduated bond issues (like the states do now). I would like to see the rest of the departments operational budgets funded with an APT as it is clearly the most free market tax there is and at that level of spending would likely be no more than.1 or.2%. I would like to see administration of these programs turned over to the states over time and the funding block granted (as apportionments) to the states to pay for them. Eventually the funding could be taken over too and the tax coiuld be completely eliminated except what is needed to fund the capital budgets of the federal departments (might get down to about.02% then)
 
 
I don't understand. Of course the 9-9-9 plan is a plan.

But its terrible and regressive and yet another demonstration that Cain's White House run is presumptuous.
 
 
 
 
 
Could you post a link to these rabid cain supporters please.

 

Gramps thread on these boards.

Hell Gramps even admits he does not know if it is a good or bad thing (the 999 coupon), but if you don't agree with it he attacks you.

Fact is Gramps is supporting a guy that is using the Political stage of running for President to sell books.

He also attacks everyone else on the stage with an outright lie claiming they don't have plans when reality is they all have far better plans than Cain. Cain literally has no plan then of top of that he has zero backup plan. Cain's super simplistic 9 9 9 plan already has to have deductions added here and there and the loopholes are already being created because Cain never thought it through because he has no intention of being President.

 

Thank you for your thoughts. But I dont buy into the no intention thing. I personally chuckle at these arguments because if anyone stopped for two seconds and took their favorite pacifiers out of their mouths they would realize there isnt a plan out there that would make it through congress without revisions. I am looking for someone who will kick the table over. Our cozy compromises have us 15 trillion in debt and counting.......................

 

That's fine but kicking the table over still won't pass meaning it ain't a fix. After President Cain's 9 9 9 plan goes nowhere what other reasons should he be president? Maybe it's his love for the Fed or zero foreign policy position.

Cains 999 plan is getting destroyed not because its bad so much as its un-passable leaving the question, what then? Cain just repeats 9. 9. 9.! That is why Cain is an idiot, he even said he does not care about foreign policy. Do you really wana find out where he stands on major issues as they come up?

Cain is going to destroy the Republican Party if he gets the nod, and thats fine with me to be honest. Many simply dont like 999 and will not accept his lack of interest on near every other issue out there, then the fanboyz like Gramps will freak out and call people that dont like Cain traitors or some dumb shit causing another breakdown in the Republican party all because they nomination a shallow EX Fed Chairman who cares more about selling books than reading to understand foreign policy.
 
 
Anyways good luck guys, Cain's plan is simply starting the landslide of rejection comming from both sides, you will find yourselves in a very small minority soon enough.

Fail hard friend.

I gave you circumstances under which the tax could be adjusted to protect the indigent. Try again?

 

I may have missed your answer:

If you accept the GOP narrative that 47% of Americans pay no federal income tax, wouldn't this 9-9-9 plan then represent a tax increase on the 150,000,000+ Americans who currently supposedly are getting a free ride from Uncle Sam?

Don't mean to be redundant...but I didn't see where you answered that question from
 Herman Cains plan? 9-9-9 For those that hate it 

 

The questions I want to ask people that are making similar arguments to yours is, do you love this country? If so, why do you feel that you have the right to live here free of charge? Why do you feel that other people must pay your way?

Now, before you think I am slamming you, don't! I believe you do love this country. What I can't understand is since you do, why do you think that you are entitled to a free ride but everyone that makes more money than you do should have to pay your way?

Immie
 
 
 
 
What's to elaborate? It's another thoughtless bumper-sticker slogan.

 

You mean like "no blood for oil" and "people before profits?"

 

Well... Yes, like those.
 
 
 
 
 
I thought we were beyond the days of acid trips and euphoria.

 

How does that prove Cain wants to abolish state taxes? Are you capable of a coherent argument?

 

Help me out here...the Federal Sales Tax will be on top of any state and local sales taxes...right?

The Federal Income Tax of 9% across the board will be on top of any State Income taxes then, right?

 

Yep.....and the problem being on the federal sales tax of 9% It could be 9% for a year or two, but then raise it higher if futrue years as they did in other countries that have adopted this. It would take a constitutional amendment to freeze it at 9%....like that would happen.
 
 
 
The questions I want to ask people that are making similar arguments to yours is, do you love this country? If so, why do you feel that you have the right to live here free of charge? Why do you feel that other people must pay your way?

 

The only people in this country who pay no taxes are people who don't work and don't buy anything/live in a state without sales tax. True story.

Who says I get the free ride so therefore why do you assume "I think that way"?

Just wanting to be clear what we're getting for 9-9-9; since answers aren't forthcoming over 2 and 3 pages, it would seem as though the answers, when they do eventually come, will not be ones that are popular. What is popular isn't always right and what is right...isn't always popular of course.

Do you love this Country?

They are talking strictly about Federal Income Taxes. I would hope that those who harp on this time and again would acknowledge that even illegal aliens contribute to the tax base by their shopping at Wal*Mart or where ever.

Does 9-9-9 abolish state and local sales taxes or State income taxes as well? If not, it looks like this is a turkey for the GOP. If you're going to say, on one hand, that 1/2 of you aren't paying federal income taxes; thats a shit load of votes you're flushing down the proverbial toilet when you explain that another 9 percent of the income is going to be taken away because that same 1/2 of people think they are taxed too high already; regardless of their Federal Income Tax status.

Yet you're saying Cain/Paul 2012 in another thread?
 
 
 
First lets start off by admiting the obvious.......... Cain actually has a plan. For better or for worse he has a plan. What do the others have?

Obama has a nifty slogan, Hate the.... er I mean tax the rich.
Romney has a plan, or as many could say a maze of confusion.
Perry to my knowledge still thinks he is in first place and doesnt need a plan beyond drilling for oil.
Bachmann hate Obamacare (great plan) but very shallow
Huntsman is a lib pretending to be a Republican.
Paul has crazy followers that think he is Obiwan Kenobi
Newt has lots of ideas that will never be heard.
Santorum just wants everyone to join the angry bus.

Now back to Cains plan....

First of all I believe it is a pretty solid plan and even if you dont believe it is, it could easily be tweaked to work. Of course we would need a Senate that actually does their job and not just table ideas they disagree with rather than debating them and offering counter solutions.

1. A limit or trigger point, if you will, could be instituted on income levels to protect the poorest among us.

2. Food could be exempt from the sales tax portion.

3. Money made in the black market would eventually produce taxes when it was eventually spent on non black market goods. Thus taxing money that otherwise slips below the radar.

4. The actual tax amount could and would be debated to what is deemed a fair amount.

5. Perscription medication could be exempt.

6. Corperations that currently dodge taxes would pay just like the rest of us.

7. The class envy war would be nullified because other than the poor everyone would pay based on their ability not their status.

People once insisted the Earth was flat and their were others that believed the sun orbited the Earth. When someone opposed those ideas they were laughed at. Who gets the last laugh now?

Our tax system is fucked beyond complicated. Why not work with ideas when they are presented? Simply raising taxes solves nothing other than to raise anymosity to new levels.

I dont have any idea if his plan is worked to the point that it is as good as it can be and neither do any of you. He has stated that in the next couple of weeks he will be releasing more information on the breadth of his plan. Point is lets try to make the system better rather than just look for the next partisan talking point.

 

This plan works in much the same way as most state taxation plans. And in most states, the lowest income earners pay the largest portion of their income in taxes. In Texas, the lowest income earners pay four times more, as a percentage of income, than the highest income earners. States have regressive tax systems, and now Herman Cain wants to bring these regressive taxes to the federal level.

I'm just curious why you believe it would be a good idea to have the lowest income earners paying the most in taxes and the highest income earners paying the least. I suppose if nothing else, it would be a good way to lay the groundwork for another revolution.

I had a change of heart over the electric fence and ground troop idea of his. I have a right to change my mind.  
 
 
^^I know just wondering...
 
 
Consumption drives 70% of the American economy.

So the former Federal Reserve guy Cain wants to tax consumption and lower taxes for the rich.

Which puts a burden on the working poor.

Shifting the tax burden from the rich to the working poor.

Republicans....it's what they do.

It does appear that way. Its a tax increase on the Federal income tax side and a tax decrease I guess since the rich will be doing 9% as well. They pay more than that now in most cases I assume.

But if the poor can't afford to buy things due to the increased tax rate, the consumption will go down to a market determined level. I don't see anything inherently wrong about that.

It would appear to be a turkey of an idea because if they are relying on the poor to continue to consume at the same rate when goods are 9% higher (minimum), it's poor planning because anybody can tell you consumption will go down in this case. Maybe the other 9%'s will make up for decreased tax revenue from the public?
 
 
 
 
 
 
First lets start off by admiting the obvious.......... Cain actually has a plan.

 

No he doesn't. He has a slogan. I could just as well have said 3-3-3 and you'd have eaten that one up, too.

A national sales tax isn't even Constitutional.

Listen you stupid fucking communist! The price of goods isn't going to increase. First, taxes on business get passed onto the consumer. Therefore, you get hit with the taxes either way. Second, getting rid of the loopholes and bring the corporate tax down to 9% (lowest in industrialized world), will great a boom of onshoring. The poor as you call them, will have a great selection of jobs to pick from.

In regards to income tax, every one wins, esp the middle class. Not only does their income tax go down, but it replaces their payroll tax!

Getting rid of capital gains tax is beyond smart. Capital gains taxes are 401k, mutual fund investment, pension fund investment, IRA, education IRA killer. It puts a barrier between companies requiring capital/investment and the investor seeking to invest!

This plan WILL create an economy and job creation boom for the middle class!
 
 
Congress has the ability to lay and collect taxes. It FULLY constitutional! The 9-9-9 tax is revenue neutral and a 3-3-3 isn't!

Dude, have you even read the damn thing? Answer:NO

 
No Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion to the Census or enumeration herein before directed to be taken.

 

Only exception is the 16th amendment, which only allows for tax on INCOME.

You can't have a 9% national sales tax. The only national sales tax you can Constitutionally have is one that is guaranteed to be apportioned amongst the states based on population. In other words - if your state has twice as many people as my state, the Congress must tax your state exactly twice as much - even if the people in your state had less sales per capita than in mine.

Really? Because property taxes went up twice in the 4 years I lived in my last apartment - and my landlady didn't raise my rent the whole time. She must have forgotten to pass me the difference. Then again, maybe she isn't the easily predictable robot you seem to think businesses are and was willing to take the hit herself to retain me as a renter. Maybe the question of who pays if taxes are raised is actually not a simple one that sophomoric brains can easily can answer to feel good about themselves - maybe its a little more complex.
 
 
Well, I commend Cain for following the Simple City Plan. Good for him...

Maybe the question of who pays if taxes are raised is actually not a simple one that sophomoric brains can easily can answer to feel good about themselves - maybe its a little more complex.

 

Running a business and renting a shack are not the same thing. I do run a business and taxes are figured into my overhead as well as my pricing. But don't let me stop you from counting sheep before bedtime.

Ps. You should change your name to iamshit. Same meaning.

The questions I want to ask people that are making similar arguments to yours is, do you love this country? If so, why do you feel that you have the right to live here free of charge? Why do you feel that other people must pay your way?

 

The only people in this country who pay no taxes are people who don't work and don't buy anything/live in a state without sales tax. True story.

 

However, those of the OWS variety ARE looking for a free ride. They are the ones that I want to ask those questions of.

I may have missed your answer:

If you accept the GOP narrative that 47% of Americans pay no federal income tax, wouldn't this 9-9-9 plan then represent a tax increase on the 150,000,000+ Americans who currently supposedly are getting a free ride from Uncle Sam?

Don't mean to be redundant...but I didn't see where you answered that question from
 Herman Cains plan? 9-9-9 For those that hate it 

 

The questions I want to ask people that are making similar arguments to yours is, do you love this country? If so, why do you feel that you have the right to live here free of charge? Why do you feel that other people must pay your way?

Now, before you think I am slamming you, don't! I believe you do love this country. What I can't understand is since you do, why do you think that you are entitled to a free ride but everyone that makes more money than you do should have to pay your way?

Immie

 

Who says I get the free ride so therefore why do you assume "I think that way"?

Just wanting to be clear what we're getting for 9-9-9; since answers aren't forthcoming over 2 and 3 pages, it would seem as though the answers, when they do eventually come, will not be ones that are popular. What is popular isn't always right and what is right...isn't always popular of course.

Do you love this Country?

 

Where did I say I assumed you did? Maybe you should try reading my post.

Yes, I do love this country and I am more than happy to pay to keep it alive and well. Nor do I blame those who have more than me for, well, for having more than me.

What is popular today is socialism. It is what the OWS crowd are fighting for. Socialism is not what this country was built upon. You're right, what is popular isn't always right.

I do not believe that the socialists who are occupying Wall Street today have any love for this nation. They seem to know nothing about what has made this nation great. They seem to want to turn us into a second Soviet experiment.

Where the hell did we as parents go wrong? We have taught our children to be exactly what our parents despised... communists.

Cains 9% sales tax would be on top of whatever sales tax you currently pay. For me it would mean a 16% sales tax.

Consumption drives 70% of the American economy.

So the former Federal Reserve guy Cain wants to tax consumption and lower taxes for the rich.

Which puts a burden on the working poor.

Shifting the tax burden from the rich to the working poor.

Republicans....it's what they do.

 

Listen you stupid fucking communist! The price of goods isn't going to increase. First, taxes on business get passed onto the consumer. Therefore, you get hit with the taxes either way. Second, getting rid of the loopholes and bring the corporate tax down to 9% (lowest in industrialized world), will great a boom of onshoring. The poor as you call them, will have a great selection of jobs to pick from.

In regards to income tax, every one wins, esp the middle class. Not only does their income tax go down, but it replaces their payroll tax!

Getting rid of capital gains tax is beyond smart. Capital gains taxes are 401k, mutual fund investment, pension fund investment, IRA, education IRA killer. It puts a barrier between companies requiring capital/investment and the investor seeking to invest!

This plan WILL create an economy and job creation boom for the middle class!

 

Here is a webpage I found that pretty much sums up the real world scenario:

 
Effective June 1, 2010 the Arizona sales tax rate for retail purchases is 6.6%. Maricopa County adds on.7% sales tax to support roads and jails. That's a total of 7.3%.

 

Author's Note: If you buy a dollar's worth of a taxable product, you pay $1.08 at this point. Right out of the box.

It continues on.

 
Then, each city may add sales tax. If you add the total of the Arizona sales tax and Maricopa County sales tax, 7.3%, to the city sales tax rate, you'll get the total retail sales tax that you'll pay when purchasing merchandise in that city.
City Sales Tax Rates in Maricopa County, Arizona Apache Junction sales tax: 2.2%
Avondale sales tax: 2.5%
Buckeye sales tax: 3.0%
Carefree sales tax: 3.0%
Cave Creek sales tax: 3.0%
Chandler sales tax: 1.5%
El Mirage sales tax: 3.0%
Fountain Hills sales tax: 2.6%
Gila Bend sales tax: 3.0%
Gilbert sales tax: 1.5%
Glendale sales tax: 2.2%
Goodyear sales tax: 2.5%
Guadalupe sales tax: 3.0%
Litchfield Park sales tax: 2.8%
Maricopa sales tax: 2.0%
Mesa sales tax: 1.75%
Paradise Valley sales tax: 1.65%
Peoria sales tax: 1.8%
Phoenix sales tax: 2.0%
Queen Creek sales tax: 2.25%
Scottsdale sales tax: 1.65%
Surprise sales tax: 2.2%
Tempe sales tax: 2.0%
Tolleson sales tax: 2.5%
Wickenburg sales tax: 2.2%
Youngtown sales tax: 3.0%

 

So take the $0.073 cents sales tax then add in whatever city you live in's tax rate and you get addition. If you live in PHX you are adding $0.093 or ten cents when you take in the local, county, and state sales taxes.

Apparently, 9-9-9 if I understand it correctly will add nine cents to every dollar spent. Making the tax rate in PHX $0.19. If I don't have that right, please tell me what the sales tax rate in Phoenix will be if 9-9-9 were in place.

Thanks.

The only way to understand something is to discuss it; so far it sounds like a turkey. I'm willing to listen to the supporters of 9-9-9 before I embrace or dismiss it.

I don't dismiss a consumption tax out of hand. It could be seen as a regulatory tool of sorts. But I doubt the consumption taxes would be tolerable when levied on top of the state and local taxes. The costs of goods will skyrocket; it takes no great financial acumen to see that. Most sales taxes will double at least. I pay about 9 cents on the dollar. It will be 18 if 9-9-9 were in place. If I buy a laptop for $2000, that is 18 cents on the dollar making the cost $2,360, right?

Now lets get real. The real cost to me will remain $2,000 because I will go on-line and buy it. I'll go on-line and buy the new I-Phone if I wish or the next I-Pad, or the new leather sofa I want. What does Cain think that will do to the local economy? I'm not going to go to Best Buy and add $360 to my bill; I'll go to  Best Buy - Computers, Video Games, TVs, Cameras, Appliances, Phones  and save that $360. True only half of that goes to the City, County or State but the other half will go to the Feds. Meanwhile my assistant's mom who works at Best Buy to make ends meet becomes jeopardized by my decision based on 9-9-9's impact.

Look for your internet purchases to become more expensive. Then guess what happens. Welcome to  Wholesale Electronics - China Wholesale - Dropship From China 

I hope I'm wrong and that the local taxes would be reduced with the encroachment of the Feds. From the silence of the 9-9-9 supporters, I'm afraid I'm right.
 
 
Will Best Buy be able to deduct their expenses because their products are not made in the United States?

I'm guessing that restaurant owners won't support his national sales tax. Ironically.
 
 
 
 
Congress has the ability to lay and collect taxes. It FULLY constitutional! The 9-9-9 tax is revenue neutral and a 3-3-3 isn't!

 
No he doesn't. He has a slogan. I could just as well have said 3-3-3 and you'd have eaten that one up, too.

A national sales tax isn't even Constitutional.

 

 

Dude, have you even read the damn thing? Answer:NO

 
No Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion to the Census or enumeration herein before directed to be taken.

 

Only exception is the 16th amendment, which only allows for tax on INCOME.

You can't have a 9% national sales tax. The only national sales tax you can Constitutionally have is one that is guaranteed to be apportioned amongst the states based on population. In other words - if your state has twice as many people as my state, the Congress must tax your state exactly twice as much - even if the people in your state had less sales per capita than in mine.

 

A sales tax is not a direct tax, it is an excize, and the congress is empowered to set excize taxes. The plan sucks, but your argument sucks more.
 
 
 
 
 
The point of this thread was to show that partisan talking points don't equate to facts and that his plan could be made to work.

I thought I made that pretty obvious in the very first post.

 

What isn't factual about my initial post? It's very simple scenario displayed math in conjunction with Cain's plan as described by him and statistics from the Department of Labor. I have only seen financial experts concur with my statements and yet to see an opposing position by an economist from the right.

 

 Father of Supply Side Economics Supports Cain's '9-9-9' Plan - HUMAN EVENTS 

 

Here's Arthur Laffer's statement to Human Events:
================================

The famed economist told HUMAN EVENTS that the proposal was pro-growth and would create the proper conditions for Americas economy to expand and thrive again.

Herman Cains 9-9-9 plan would be a vast improvement over the current tax system and a boon to the U.S. economy, Laffer told HUMAN EVENTS in a statement. The goal of supply-side tax reform is always a broadening of the tax base and lowering of marginal tax rates.

Added Laffer: Mr. Cains plan is simple, transparent, neutral with respect to capital and labor, and savings and consumption, and also greatly decreases the hidden costs of tax compliance. There is no doubt that economic growth would surge upon implementation of 9-9-9.

Laffer also said that such a system provides the least avenues to avoid paying taxes, yet also maintains the strongest incentives for work effort, production, and investment.

 http://hermancainpac.com/2011/10/art...ns-9-9-9-plan 

=================================
Please note that Laffer doesn't address the fact that the Middle Class and the poor will end up paying out a larger percentage of their income that the more wealthy class with the National Sales Tax portion of 9-9-9.
Why would he do that? Probably because he's a strong Supply Side economist, in other words he strongly pro-business. And for business, 9-9-9 is a wet dream! Laffer clearly ignores the fact that 9-9-9 would be a nightmare for the Middle Class and poor. Laffer also ignores that the other half of "supply and demand" is demand ! Businesses are saying that they aren't hiring because the consumer class isn't buying so there is low demand. The National Sales Tax will probably lower demand more because it pinches the consumer class's expendable income.

Why so dense? You know that money that's always missing when you get your paycheck? Yea the taxes. Well under Cain, that missing money will return to your check. Essentially offsetting the 9% sales tax. In fact you will most likely come out ahead by far with the exception of new car or new home purchases. And how many poor people buy NEW houses or cars?

Your outrage is completely comical.

If you are working poor, your tax rate drops from 14% down to 9% and you now have to pay a whopping 16% on EVERYTHING you buy

Your math is a crock of shit. Your already paying 7 to 9% sales tax. So its an increase of 9% not 16%

And who the Fuck currently has 14% with held from their checks? If your going to attempt to do math at least get the base figures correct would ya.....

They are socialists, there is no two ways to put it. They want the government to make everything equal so that they don't have to work. They want to be spoon fed. They want a frigging "living wage" for sitting on their damned asses in a park crapping on police cars. What the hell else can they be?

Correct, that would be 16 percent for me as well.

 

Perhaps you have not read their "list of demands"?

They are socialists, there is no two ways to put it. They want the government to make everything equal so that they don't have to work. They want to be spoon fed. They want a frigging "living wage" for sitting on their damned asses in a park crapping on police cars. What the hell else can they be?

They want more than this...But of course, I'm not going into it as grampa murked u will get angery.  
 
 
 
 
 
Why so dense? You know that money that's always missing when you get your paycheck? Yea the taxes. Well under Cain, that missing money will return to your check. Essentially offsetting the 9% sales tax. In fact you will most likely come out ahead by far with the exception of new car or new home purchases. And how many poor people buy NEW houses or cars?

Your outrage is completely comical.

 

No taxes are charged for used car or used house purchases? Interesting.

 

NO USED PRODUCTS have taxes assessed on them. Only new.

 

Just saw that on Meet the Press. Gotcha.

Yes, I do love this country and I am more than happy to pay to keep it alive and well. Nor do I blame those who have more than me for, well, for having more than me.

What is popular today is socialism. It is what the OWS crowd are fighting for. Socialism is not what this country was built upon. You're right, what is popular isn't always right.

I do not believe that the socialists who are occupying Wall Street today have any love for this nation. They seem to know nothing about what has made this nation great. They seem to want to turn us into a second Soviet experiment.

Where the hell did we as parents go wrong? We have taught our children to be exactly what our parents despised... communists.

The train tracks are well behind you. Getting back to 9-9-9....does it replace the state and local taxes or is it another tax on top? I'm guessing it is does since most Cain supporters won't come on out and say it.

 

Maybe it is you that needs to take the remedial English course?

I addressed those questions to other people. I specifically said I wanted to ask those questions of people who made statements such as yours. I never asked you.

Employment is not a prerequisite for exercising ones First Amendment rights.

You make a number of assumptions without providing any evidence  indeed: what evidence do you have that members of OWS are looking for a free ride or are socialists.

Why? Whats the point of discussing idiocy?

To wit:

Correct, that would be 16 percent for me as well.

You hate it because its Cains plan and he is black. You've made your hatred for everything black quite clear.
 
 
 
 
 
Cain has never said anything about changing state taxes.

Do try to keep your hate based in reality will you. Less you enjoy being looked upon with the same admiration as TM.

I don't think it will be either. The effective tax rate on the lower and middle class would go up significantly not only in regards to "income tax" (the first 9%) but also by adding the National Sales Tax.

This plan would place a huge burden on low income people and the middle class. The total amounts that they pay would still not come close to that paid by the upper class, but the effective rate would be an outrageous burden on the lower classes.

I suspect there could be items that were not taxed such as food and clothing, but that won't alleviate the problem and once again you will open the doors for Congress to insert loopholes that benefit certain people.

So....if you are wealthy your tax rate drops from 36% down to 9%
If you are working poor, your tax rate drops from 14% down to 9% and you now have to pay a whopping 16% on EVERYTHING you buy

What a crock of shit

 

Your math is a crock of shit. Your already paying 7 to 9% sales tax. So its an increase of 9% not 16%

And who the Fuck currently has 14% with held from their checks? If your going to attempt to do math at least get the base figures correct would ya.....

 

The working poor are paying that right now, even less with deductions. Now they give up the standard deduction, dependent deductions, mortgage deductions all so they can drop a few percentage points? Meanwhile the wealthy, including Cain, get their tax rate slashed 24%?

Can Cain be any more obvious he is raping the poor?

Good point;

I got this off of Wikipedia:

 
The United States federal  excise tax  on gasoline, as of February 2011, is 18.4 cents per gallon (4.86 ¢/L) and 24.4 cents per gallon (6.45 ¢/L) for  diesel fuel .

 

Will that go down to 9 cents under 9-9-9?

While I will admit without certain triggers in place it would be harder on the poor than the rich. But it would be fair from the aspect that everyone pays based on their ability not their worth.
It no more unfair than our current system that punishes success. You guys have screamed about everyone paying their fair share for some time. Now that there is a proposal that is fair in its truest form your crying foul. Ironic eh?
 
 
If you make less than $17,400 you currently pay 10% Federal tax. You get to deduct dependents and your mortgage.

Cain is going to offer these people a 1% reduction in taxes with NO deductions and then charge them 9% on everything they purchase

Meanwhile he offers wealthy Americans a 24% reduction in their tax rate

Not really.

First those rates are marginal rates. The rich don't pay 36% with all the loopholes. Nor do the poor pay 14%, because they also get at least the standard deduction and exemptions.

The upper class would, in fact, see a significant decrease in their tax rate and the poor would see the reverse. Under the fair tax, the bill is written that it does not take effect UNTIL the 16th amendment is repealed and income taxes are eliminated. That would switch us to a consumption tax basis.

Under the 9-9-9 plan it would establish both an income tax and a national sales tax and there would be little, if anything, to keep Congress from raising the tax rate at anytime that they wanted.

Not sure on the 9-9-9 plan, but "The Fair Tax" was written so that the tax was only charged on purchases of new products so that the purchase of a used car or second hand home would not have paid taxes except for on the commission i.e. the charge to the real estate broker.

I can't answer that as I don't think Cain's 9-9-9 has actually been written.

The way "The Fair Tax" was written, it would have gone away as ALL federal taxes; income, social security, medicare, excise etc, were replaced by the Fair Tax.

Just on the face of it; doesn't it seem like there would be this giant incubator of shenanigans? I mean, I can see where your realtor/buyer or car dealer would have someone spend 1 night in the house prior to your buying it so it would be used or put 50 miles on the car so you can save what will be an outrageous amount ($27,000 on a new house listing for $300,000 and $2700 on a $30,000 car).

Are you deliberately being one sided in this?

You are correct in the first part of your analysis. However, you seem to forget that the rich have many loopholes all to themselves and all of the "loopholes" that are available to the poor to reduce their tax rates as well. The "rich" would not get a 24% reduction in their taxes as they don't pay the full rate on all of their income and their effective rates are significantly below the top marginal rates.

Come on, your argument holds water WITHOUT skewing your data.

No, it wouldn't work that way. The way it is written is such that the tax would only be charged on the first sale of the item not on whether or not the item was used.

I suppose you might find someone selling the house for one night, but I truly doubt they could get away with that and if you actually hand over the deed "for one night" you would likely find out that the "buyer" won't sign it back over to you the next morning. Also, renting it for one night or renting out a car for one day would not effect a sale. The buyer would simply have to pay the tax on the cost of the rental.

Of course, I wouldn't have thought that my bank would sell my mortgage to an investment bank who would then take it and bundle it with other mortgages and sell them to other investors....then pay their rating agency to have these bundles of mortgages rated AAA so they could sell the financial instruments to pension programs.

Somehow, I would imagine that this built-in penalty to buying a big ticket item as new will be an easier nut to crack.

It's now 5% and it matters not as that 5% isn't enough to do jack shit. Nothing will come of a 5% increase except for congresses ability to waste even more of our money.

A large cut however could and in my opinion would spur growth in both the economy and job growth.

Still trying to sell that trickle down snake oil?
 
 
 
First lets start off by admiting the obvious.......... Cain actually has a plan. For better or for worse he has a plan. What do the others have?

Obama has a nifty slogan, Hate the.... er I mean tax the rich.
Romney has a plan, or as many could say a maze of confusion.
Perry to my knowledge still thinks he is in first place and doesnt need a plan beyond drilling for oil.
Bachmann hate Obamacare (great plan) but very shallow
Huntsman is a lib pretending to be a Republican.
Paul has crazy followers that think he is Obiwan Kenobi
Newt has lots of ideas that will never be heard.
Santorum just wants everyone to join the angry bus.

Now back to Cains plan....

First of all I believe it is a pretty solid plan and even if you dont believe it is, it could easily be tweaked to work. Of course we would need a Senate that actually does their job and not just table ideas they disagree with rather than debating them and offering counter solutions.

1. A limit or trigger point, if you will, could be instituted on income levels to protect the poorest among us.

2. Food could be exempt from the sales tax portion.

3. Money made in the black market would eventually produce taxes when it was eventually spent on non black market goods. Thus taxing money that otherwise slips below the radar.

4. The actual tax amount could and would be debated to what is deemed a fair amount.

5. Perscription medication could be exempt.

6. Corperations that currently dodge taxes would pay just like the rest of us.

7. The class envy war would be nullified because other than the poor everyone would pay based on their ability not their status.

People once insisted the Earth was flat and their were others that believed the sun orbited the Earth. When someone opposed those ideas they were laughed at. Who gets the last laugh now?

Our tax system is fucked beyond complicated. Why not work with ideas when they are presented? Simply raising taxes solves nothing other than to raise anymosity to new levels.

I dont have any idea if his plan is worked to the point that it is as good as it can be and neither do any of you. He has stated that in the next couple of weeks he will be releasing more information on the breadth of his plan. Point is lets try to make the system better rather than just look for the next partisan talking point.

 

I am all for tax reform, but the one question that I have is the 9% consumption tax, would that be on top of state and local taxes? My state sales tax is at 7.4% would that mean that total sales taxes would be at 15.4 %? Some states don't have a sales tax, but others do. I like the idea, but want more information on it. I have always supported a flat tax, if you make a dollar you pay 10% if you make a million you pay 10%.

5% will accomplish NOTHING, except of course to single out one group of people. That's not an economic plan, its a joke.
 
 
 
 
3%

Remember that? A measly 3%

That is what Obama wanted to raise the tax rate on those making over $1 million a year. The Republicans locked up government and threatened to default on our loans......all over 3 lousy percent

Now they have the gall to offer millionaires a 24% tax cut while raising taxes on the poorest Americans?

 

It's now 5% and it matters not as that 5% isn't enough to do jack shit. Nothing will come of a 5% increase except for congresses ability to waste even more of our money.

A large cut however could and in my opinion would spur growth in both the economy and job growth.

So..... Yea.....

 

This is going to get me in trouble with conservatives, but do you have any data to prove that lowering taxes on the rich will spark economic growth, more specifically job growth?

This mantra has been used by Republicans and conservatives since at least the days of Reagan, but it seems to me to be a broken record and worse yet, unproven.

Now, don't get me wrong, I don't think Obama's "Flood the Basement" economics works either, but I must say when taxes are as low as they are for the rich, I don't think lowering their taxes more will do a damned thing.

Quite frankly, I don't think it is so much the tax rate that is the problem as it is the anti-corporate environment of this country.

First lets start off by admiting the obvious.......... Cain actually has a plan. For better or for worse he has a plan. What do the others have?

Obama has a nifty slogan, Hate the.... er I mean tax the rich.
Romney has a plan, or as many could say a maze of confusion.
Perry to my knowledge still thinks he is in first place and doesnt need a plan beyond drilling for oil.
Bachmann hate Obamacare (great plan) but very shallow
Huntsman is a lib pretending to be a Republican.
Paul has crazy followers that think he is Obiwan Kenobi
Newt has lots of ideas that will never be heard.
Santorum just wants everyone to join the angry bus.

Now back to Cains plan....

First of all I believe it is a pretty solid plan and even if you dont believe it is, it could easily be tweaked to work. Of course we would need a Senate that actually does their job and not just table ideas they disagree with rather than debating them and offering counter solutions.

1. A limit or trigger point, if you will, could be instituted on income levels to protect the poorest among us.

2. Food could be exempt from the sales tax portion.

3. Money made in the black market would eventually produce taxes when it was eventually spent on non black market goods. Thus taxing money that otherwise slips below the radar.

4. The actual tax amount could and would be debated to what is deemed a fair amount.

5. Perscription medication could be exempt.

6. Corperations that currently dodge taxes would pay just like the rest of us.

7. The class envy war would be nullified because other than the poor everyone would pay based on their ability not their status.

People once insisted the Earth was flat and their were others that believed the sun orbited the Earth. When someone opposed those ideas they were laughed at. Who gets the last laugh now?

Our tax system is fucked beyond complicated. Why not work with ideas when they are presented? Simply raising taxes solves nothing other than to raise anymosity to new levels.

I dont have any idea if his plan is worked to the point that it is as good as it can be and neither do any of you. He has stated that in the next couple of weeks he will be releasing more information on the breadth of his plan. Point is lets try to make the system better rather than just look for the next partisan talking point.

 

I am all for tax reform, but the one question that I have is the 9% consumption tax, would that be on top of state and local taxes? My state sales tax is at 7.4% would that mean that total sales taxes would be at 15.4 %? Some states don't have a sales tax, but others do. I like the idea, but want more information on it. I have always supported a flat tax, if you make a dollar you pay 10% if you make a million you pay 10%.

 

Yes, it would be an addition to any local taxes collected.
 
 
 
 
 
If you make less than $17,400 you currently pay 10% Federal tax. You get to deduct dependents and your mortgage.

Cain is going to offer these people a 1% reduction in taxes with NO deductions and then charge them 9% on everything they purchase

Meanwhile he offers wealthy Americans a 24% reduction in their tax rate

What a screw job...You call that FAIR?

 

Do I consider it fair? Actually yes, I do. However, I would not support the plan in its purest form. As I stated in my op I believe we MUST institute triggers to protect the truly poor from falling into abject poverty.

But as usual most of the left ignores my thoughts about how it could work and just jumps on the hate bandwagon.

 

With all due respect...who cares what you propose?

It is not on the table now. Cains 9-9-9 is on the table and the rightwing is fawning over it. At a time when the poorest Americans are struggling for jobs and losing the American dream, Conservatives are threatening to raise their taxes.

Meanwhile, the wealthiest Americans who have seen their percentage of wealth grow significantly over the last 30 years receive a 24% tax cut

 

You don't help the poor by destroying the rich.

Cain's comments about creating "empowerment" zones with a 3-3-3 standard for them sounds like a closet liberal or typical black politician looking out for "his people."

After he talked up a 3-3-3 standard for the inner city, he needs to get lost. Just another typical black politician putting black people above every other American....

lowering taxes by a large amount will leave money in the pockets of many. What do people do with extra money? They invest it to make more. That investment grows the economy.

Anyone who believes the rich bury their money in tin cans in their back yard, thus removing it from the economic cycle, doesn't belong in a debate about taxes.

Money doesn't just sit in a bank vault doing nothing. Investments trickle all through the system. Just this weekend someone invested in an unnecessary upgrade in their kitchen. I then took that investment and bought some new work equipment. That's small potatoes of course but its the same principle.
 
 
What doesn't surprise?

That Cain said a stupid thing with the 3-3-3 bullshit?

So black people in the inner city get a 3% tax rate but us "rich" middle class white folk get the 9% tax based on our zip code?

HE IS TOAST NOW. I would've voted for him until he showed his "true color."

Current system

Family of 4 earning 50K using standard deductions would pay taxes on aproximately 24K, the tax on that is around 2.7K. They would also have a 7.65% payroll tax amounting to an additional aproximately 3.8K making thier entire tax bill around 6.5K after the child tax credit and additional child tax credit they would owe less than 4.5K This is with no other deductions and no other credits.

Under Cains 9-9-9 plan

pay 4.5K up front, and then they pay another 9% on what they spend, suppose they spend 20K on taxable items thats an additional 1.8K making thier total tax bill 6.3K a $1800 tax increase under 9-9-9 for a family of four earning 50K.

This plan sucks.

However, where your analysis fails is in what do they do with their money. For the most part they are not going out and hiring people. They are buying stocks and bonds and purchasing other investments with their money because our government is not making it profitable for them to hire Americans. If they buy stocks with their money, then then only employment that provides is for the broker and the market-maker.

As long as this continues, and it is likely to last at least as long as our current POTUS holds the Oval Office, we the lower classes of America are just plain SCREWED.

You forgetting one other factor.

When people invest in paper and not tangibles that investment doesn't just stop there. Just like the housing collapse shows, the money from those initial investments is then invested in other investments. Eventually it will make its way into tangibles which requires products to be made, sold or improved.

The money doesn't just sit in one account forever. It trickles through the entire system until someone pulls it out or cashes in.

Well you are correct in that the person who sells the stock will then buy something with the money he receives... most likely gold or other stocks. The stockbroker will also buy something with their profits... most likely stocks and bonds. And those who receive those funds from them will most likely purchase something with their profits... most likely stocks and bonds.

Under today's conditions what they are not purchasing is employees, at least not American employees. What must be done in order to fix your analysis is that today's conditions have to be corrected and that is going to take putting a new person in the Oval Office (preferably not someone from the Washington establishment) and until we do that things are not going to change.

Quite frankly, it would be foolish for the rich to "invest" their capital in employing Americans today.

the current system is from the IRS calculator and uses only the standard deduction, child tax credit and additional child tax credit. No other deductions or credits are employed, if they were the current tax bill would be even lower.

Cains tax bill is from his formulae

9% of the gross minus charitable contributions (considering none, as I did in the currrent evaluation) and 9% of what a typical family of foiur earning 50K might spend in a year on taxable purchases, which under Cain's plan is everything thats not used.

The numbers don't lie.

That implies that every time the economy needs a boost we need to further cut taxes, and thus at some point taxes reach zero,

the government is bankrupt, chaos reigns, and worst of all,

what do you do the next time the economy needs a boost?  
 
 
 
Really. What's there to hate? If it gets dummies to go on record in support of it......it is worth the few minutes it takes to understand that it is folly. Too bad the dummies will NEVER come back here and admit that they were wrong to buy into it. The heels are dug in already.

BTW.....President Obama has a plan......he's been working the plan for a few years now.

 

What PLAN is THAT?
He's bamboozled the public twqice to the tune of nearly one trillion dollars. Now he wants a third bite at the apple. His is message is "trust me. It will work THIS TIME. I promise".
If that is what you refer to as a "plan", that is frightening.
 
 
 
 
 
Well, we still have the Bush tax cuts in place; wheres the jobs and prosperity?

 

from the time they were enacted to the time the bubble burst in 2007 they produced 8M jobs. Once Obama signed them into law to continue them as is the job hemoraging from the bubble bursting stopped. As it is tax cuts have a shelf life on effecting the economy and it ended once they became the norm.

 

That implies that every time the economy needs a boost we need to further cut taxes, and thus at some point taxes reach zero,

the government is bankrupt, chaos reigns, and worst of all,

what do you do the next time the economy needs a boost?  

 

The tax code needs serious revision. The government needs reorganization.

Just raising taxes is suicide.

That Cain said a stupid thing with the 3-3-3 bullshit?

So black people in the inner city get a 3% tax rate but us "rich" middle class white folk get the 9% tax based on our zip code?

 

Hell, I'd move to the inner city if I get a 6% cut in income and sales tax. Especially if it was a place like Brooklyn where I'd at least have a good transit system.

That makes sense. So if we were to get to zero taxes, just for the sake of argument, it would only have an effect for so long then, right?

 

notionally yes. Tax cuts only spur growth when they're cuts. When they become the norm they are just "normal" and spur no growth, they just don't impede it. Thats why since Obama signed the extension of the Bush tax cuts the economy has stabalized but not been spurred. Bush's cuts in the 4 years after they were enacted helped in the creation of 8M jobs, how long would you consider a tax cut is a tax cut instead of just being the tax rate? Taxes have been the same for about 9 years now, when your tax rate is the same for nine years in a row keeping them the same is not a cut and will spur no growth.
 
 
going back to a company like wal mart.

Consider Cains formula.

Gross income - (purchases from US business' + investments) = taxable income.

for simplicity purposes we'll say they have revenue of 1B

Currently wal mart operates on about a 10% net meaning they pay at most 35% of the 100M net or around 25M plus they pay 7.65% of payroll which for wal mart considering economies of scale is only about 50% of revenue (this would include the payroll taxes), meaning they currently pay something in the area of 40M in payroll taxes for a total tax bill of roughly 75M.

under 9-9-9

1B in revenue minus purchases from US companies (which for walmart is close to ZERO) call it 5% to be charitable to the plan = 950M in revenue - investments. Investments for wal mart are tricky since the vast majority of any investment they make is going to be in building new stores, which of course means they will be subject to the 9% sales tax in doing so, so in effect they will be paying the 9%, just not in incometaxes-- it is a wash. For all practicle purposes wall mart will be taxed on virtually thier entire revenue, thats a 9% tax on 950B or around 85M in taxes a 10M tax INCREASE.

So tell me again Herman how embedded taxes will "go away"?

Normal business expenses like COL and opperations are not deductable from revenue under Cain's plan, only purchases made from US companies and investments are. So a retailor who sells mostly foriegn goods is going to have to pay a 9% tax on the revenue they use to purchase foriegn goods and a 9% tax on the revenue they use to pay thier employees. Then you get to pay a 9% sales tax when you buy it on top of the "embedded taxes" that under Cain's plan aren't going anywhere despite his claims.
 
 
 
 
 
You need to ask harry Reid and Obama not me.

 

You said this:

 
A large cut however could and in my opinion would spur growth in both the economy and job growth.

 

We did that. I'm asking you.

 

Your asking me a clearly partisan question. I gave you a partisan response. Seems fair to me.

Or did you actually expect tax cuts from nearly a decade ago to create jobs today?  

 

Wasn't a partisan question; it was a very fair question and you, as always, took it to an "us against them" place. You went so far to state that the GOP doesn't care if its a good or bad thing for the nation; only that it is a political football. You should expect more from your party.

As for what I expected, gee, if tax cuts were such a silver bullet, how did we end up here? I mean, we had the tax cuts, there should be more money in the economy than ever--in the hands of the rich who supposedly create jobs and expand the economy. What happened? I'm your response will in no way mention funding 2 major wars while cutting taxes; will it?

That may be so, I'm not sure, but I do know that all of the stuff they buy from other countries, which is the majority of thier product will not be deductable from revenue, so it will have a 9% embedded tax on it before the sales tax ever gets applied.

Not even close. When tax cuts first take effect they people and business' have more money than they did before they take effect, over time that additional money gets incorporated into thier normal spending habits and becomes the new norm. after 4 or 5 years the stimulative effect is gone as to stimulate the economy you have to pump something new into it and the same taxes you had last year for 5 years is nothing new. It is a matter of norming, not psychology.

Considering that the US's economy is 70% driven by Consumer Spending. Cain's plan very likely hurt the economy of this country.

=====================================

Cain’s Sales Tax Would Hurt Consumer Spending

Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain’s plan to create a national sales tax would hurt retailers, threaten economic growth and shift the tax burden onto the middle class and poor, tax experts and business groups said.

<snip>

Tax experts and business groups interviewed yesterday don’t like his tax plan as much as voters. They said it would shift the burden to middle-income and poor families and would hurt sales across the economy, at least in the short term.

“There will be a noticeable decline in consumer spending for some years,” said Rachelle Bernstein, vice president of the National Retail Federation, based in Washington, in an interview. “We know that that has an impact on consumer spending and GDP.”

Consumer spending accounts for about 70 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product.

 Cain 
================================

Considering Cain is in retail, one would think he had a clue about the effects of his 9-9-9's plan of the middle class and the poor, but even more so on the US's consumer driven economy. His knowledge of basic economics is very suspect.
 
 
The implementation of a national sales tax without a repeal of the 16th Amendment is a bad idea and I won't support it. End required analysis of 9-9-9.

There was no capital gains tax cut in 1995. Nice try though.

So, the jobs created between 1993 and 1997, what caused them?

You conservatarians sure believe an awful lot in the benevolent power of government.

I think you're half right. I think the Capital Gains tax cut (in 1997, btw) helped spur job creation, but I don't think the fiscal sanity (which includes Clinton's tax increases) did anything except help the bonds market. If there's anything that gets forgotten about the '90s is OPEC kept oil prices artificially low. Forget anything American politicians did during the '90s as the primary catalyst for economic growth.

In my opinion (and I believe studies agree with me), fiscal sanity is an investment for the future, not for the economy of today. There is some fear of a debt overhang slowing investments (particularly long-term investments), but there are tons of other factors that are much more important.

I'm cautiously a Keynsian (with some conservative ideas sprinkled in). I believe the U.S. should run a budget surplus during the good years so it can build up a rainy day fund. Then, I believe the U.S. should engage in deficit spending during the lean years (spend money or cut taxes, it doesn't make that much of a difference). The '90s had a budget surplus and it should have (it honestly wasn't high enough, but it's tough to cut government spending). I believe the middle years of the Bush Administration should have been running a surplus (some of that is the Republican's fault and much is the Democratic Congress's fault). But right now, there is almost no way to run a surplus. The economy is depressed (lower revenues) and cutting spending will depress it further.

I apologize for the disorganized (and rambling) nature of this post. I didn't eat lunch yet, so my brain is frazzled.

But are those products "made in the USA"?

Cain hasn't decided yet if his plan lets businesses deduct computers designed in the USA with parts from California, Japan and Korea and assembled in Thailand.

Yeah, I had to go back, there was however a 91B tax cut in 96, and there were small business and some individual tax cuts in 1994. The CG tax cut was in 97 and spurred growth further.

Further as I have stated in other posts, tax cuts CONTRIBUTE to job creation, by they are not the only thing that does so, it's a package. Tax increases are also a drag on the economy and thats the reason why the GOP won in 1994 to begin with (and why Clinton poassed his "targetted tax cuts" in 1994 in an attempt to own the politics of tax cuts.. Clintons high tax policies were slowing down the recovery which started under GHWB and which he benefitted from greatly. One thing you have to remember also, until Obama took office and the democratics held the budget hostage until Bush was gone every Presidents first year in office is a continuation of his predecessors policies. You do remember that right after the 92 election and before Clinton had even taken office he was already taking credit for the recovery that was already under way don't you?
 
 
Another hilarity is that less than a year ago, when he thought it was a Democrat idea,

Cain said that a national sales tax was 'the worst idea proposed'.

no part of my response eluded to us vs them. And what do the wars have to do with our current tax debate? Moving the goalposts doesn't change the core part of our discussion.

You people want government control because you are incapable of managing your own finances. You people also believe that compassion begins in the bank accounts of other people and should be managed by bureaucrats.
Clinton was no economic scholar. What he did was listen to much smarter people than he.
Clinton was convinced he needed to increase taxes because as a liberal, that is what they do. What actually happened is Clinton at the advice of his advisors, let the economy run itself. The result was one of the biggest economic booms in US history. Also one of the longest periods of economic prosperity.
Your notion that only high taxes can drive an economy is a FAIL.

He unlike most politicians is attempting to be honest on all fronts of the debate. It's refreshing to see someone who doesn't mislead the public in an attempt to garner more votes. Is he or his plan perfect? Hell no, but to his credit he isn't hiding the facts.

Any other candidate besides maybe Paul would have dodged that question or changed the subject all together.
 
 
 
 
Consumption drives 70% of the American economy.

So the former Federal Reserve guy Cain wants to tax consumption and lower taxes for the rich.
Which puts a burden on the working poor.
Shifting the tax burden from the rich to the working poor.
Republicans....it's what they do.

 

Here is a webpage I found that pretty much sums up the real world scenario:

 
Effective June 1, 2010 the Arizona sales tax rate for retail purchases is 6.6%. Maricopa County adds on.7% sales tax to support roads and jails. That's a total of 7.3%.

 

Author's Note: If you buy a dollar's worth of a taxable product, you pay $1.08 at this point. Right out of the box.

It continues on.

Then, each city may add sales tax. If you add the total of the Arizona sales tax and Maricopa County sales tax, 7.3%, to the city sales tax rate, you'll get the total retail sales tax that you'll pay when purchasing merchandise in that city.

Apparently, 9-9-9 if I understand it correctly will add nine cents to every dollar spent. Making the tax rate in PHX $0.19. If I don't have that right, please tell me what the sales tax rate in Phoenix will be if 9-9-9 were in place.

Thanks.

 

People would still be paying State, County, Property, City etc sales tax ANYHOW.
Does the 9% Federal Sales Tax equate to what one pays now in federal taxes? (And I don't mean 'pay', then get it all refunded)
Some will answer yes, some no.
999 is merely an idea at this point and has not been thoroughly analyzed.
So, to me, having an opinion without having all the details is pointless.
 
 
 
 
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain acknowledged on Sunday his "9-9-9" tax reform plan would raise taxes on some Americans but denied criticism it would help the rich while hurting the poor.

"Some people will pay more. But most people will pay less," Cain, a former chief executive of Godfather's Pizza who has never held elected office, said on NBC's "Meet the Press."

He unlike most politicians is attempting to be honest on all fronts of the debate. It's refreshing to see someone who doesn't mislead the public in an attempt to garner more votes. Is he or his plan perfect? Hell no, but to his credit he isn't hiding the facts.

Any other candidate besides maybe Paul would have dodged that question or changed the subject all together.

 

The left loves being lied to. It's the only way they ever win.

Your asking me a clearly partisan question. I gave you a partisan response. Seems fair to me.

Or did you actually expect tax cuts from nearly a decade ago to create jobs today?  

 

Wasn't a partisan question; it was a very fair question and you, as always, took it to an "us against them" place. You went so far to state that the GOP doesn't care if its a good or bad thing for the nation; only that it is a political football. You should expect more from your party.

As for what I expected, gee, if tax cuts were such a silver bullet, how did we end up here? I mean, we had the tax cuts, there should be more money in the economy than ever--in the hands of the rich who supposedly create jobs and expand the economy. What happened? I'm your response will in no way mention funding 2 major wars while cutting taxes; will it?

 

no part of my response eluded to us vs them. And what do the wars have to do with our current tax debate? Moving the goalposts doesn't change the core part of our discussion. Besides did Obama raise taxes to pay for the wars? Yea, its a moot point. Were talking about the effects of taxes on jobs not the wars. Nice try though.

 

Didn't think you'd admit it was the seeds of financial disaster.
 
 
 
 
I'm not sure if it is part of the equation above but Wal Mart buys a shitload from American companies. It may not be in the taxable category so it may not be applicable.

 

But are those products "made in the USA"?

Cain hasn't decided yet if his plan lets businesses deduct computers designed in the USA with parts from California, Japan and Korea and assembled in Thailand.

 

s

Yes, they are made in the USA. For all of the guff Wal*Mart gets for featuring a lot of stuff made from overseas, almost all of the food in Wal*Mart (there are some exceptions) is produced in this country. Wal*Mart is the #1 grocer in the US. As I said though, I know food isn't taxed when we buy it but I don't know about the wholesale level. I doubt it.

But Wal*Mart does buy a shitload of domestically produced goods.
 
 
 
 
 
notionally yes. Tax cuts only spur growth when they're cuts. When they become the norm they are just "normal" and spur no growth, they just don't impede it. Thats why since Obama signed the extension of the Bush tax cuts the economy has stabalized but not been spurred. Bush's cuts in the 4 years after they were enacted helped in the creation of 8M jobs, how long would you consider a tax cut is a tax cut instead of just being the tax rate? Taxes have been the same for about 9 years now, when your tax rate is the same for nine years in a row keeping them the same is not a cut and will spur no growth.

 

Sounds as though you're making an argument that it is a psychological effect.

 

Not even close. When tax cuts first take effect they people and business' have more money than they did before they take effect, over time that additional money gets incorporated into thier normal spending habits and becomes the new norm. after 4 or 5 years the stimulative effect is gone as to stimulate the economy you have to pump something new into it and the same taxes you had last year for 5 years is nothing new. It is a matter of norming, not psychology.

 

So after one budget cycle, there should be no effect if taxes are cut on businesses?

Why the hell would I admit that when our tax code had NOTHING to do with the housing bubble collapse that caused our downfall?

who said that? Obviously if the cut is big enough it takes time for the adjustment to take root and become the new normal. Think about how long it would take to spend a million bucks if you were trying not to spend it anywhere that wouldn't return more than you spent and you'll get the idea. If the kitty's big enough and being replenished as it's spent it's gonna take a while and the stimulative effect will last longer. At some point however all the growth that can be financed by it is purchased and things settle out in a bigger pie returning to normal except the pie is bigger. At that point the cut stops having a stimulating effect because it takes more money to fill the pie. I mean if you want to have an adult conversation fine. But if what you're doing is attempting to catch me in some imagined and exagerated inconsistancy by asking stupid and leading questions then I'll pass.
 
 
 
Eh, he passed the second largest tax hike as a % of GDP since WW2.

 

Clinton likes to say he passed the largest tax cut as well, referring to his cuts on tariffs and trade barriers (one of the issues he came into the Presidency seeking).

OK. I did know that Wal-Mart's food tends to be US-grown. Not every Wal-Mart has food, though, and I'm guessing as a percentage of Wal-Mart's total expenses, labor and merchandise from overseas dwarfs it. I can't be sure, though.

I don't have any problem with Wal-Mart, though. I think the issue is whether Cain's plan would increase Wal-Mart's taxes enough to cause layoffs (being that it is America's largest employer).

WASHINGTON  Herman Cain's 9-9-9 tax plan would raise taxes on 84 percent of U.S. households, according to an independent analysis released Tuesday, contradicting claims by the Republican presidential candidate that most Americans would see a tax cut.

The Tax Policy Center, a Washington think tank, says low- and middle-income families would be hit hardest, with households making between $10,000 and $20,000 seeing their taxes increase by nearly 950 percent.

"You're talking a $2,700 tax increase for people with incomes between $10,000 and $20,000," said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center. "That's huge."

Households with the highest incomes, however, would get big tax cuts. Those making more than $1 million a year would see their taxes cut nearly in half, on average, according to the analysis.

I made it clear in my op that I was not wed to the plan in its purest form. I know it needs work. I also know its a good base to start from.

Who are you guys trying to convince that its bad in its current form?

Every idea or piece of legislation that matters goes through changes.
 
 
 
First lets start off by admiting the obvious.......... Cain actually has a plan. For better or for worse he has a plan. What do the others have?

Obama has a nifty slogan, Hate the.... er I mean tax the rich.
Romney has a plan, or as many could say a maze of confusion.
Perry to my knowledge still thinks he is in first place and doesnt need a plan beyond drilling for oil.
Bachmann hate Obamacare (great plan) but very shallow
Huntsman is a lib pretending to be a Republican.
Paul has crazy followers that think he is Obiwan Kenobi
Newt has lots of ideas that will never be heard.
Santorum just wants everyone to join the angry bus.

Now back to Cains plan....

First of all I believe it is a pretty solid plan and even if you dont believe it is, it could easily be tweaked to work. Of course we would need a Senate that actually does their job and not just table ideas they disagree with rather than debating them and offering counter solutions.

1. A limit or trigger point, if you will, could be instituted on income levels to protect the poorest among us.

2. Food could be exempt from the sales tax portion.

3. Money made in the black market would eventually produce taxes when it was eventually spent on non black market goods. Thus taxing money that otherwise slips below the radar.

4. The actual tax amount could and would be debated to what is deemed a fair amount.

5. Perscription medication could be exempt.

6. Corperations that currently dodge taxes would pay just like the rest of us.

7. The class envy war would be nullified because other than the poor everyone would pay based on their ability not their status.

People once insisted the Earth was flat and their were others that believed the sun orbited the Earth. When someone opposed those ideas they were laughed at. Who gets the last laugh now?

Our tax system is fucked beyond complicated. Why not work with ideas when they are presented? Simply raising taxes solves nothing other than to raise anymosity to new levels.

I dont have any idea if his plan is worked to the point that it is as good as it can be and neither do any of you. He has stated that in the next couple of weeks he will be releasing more information on the breadth of his plan. Point is lets try to make the system better rather than just look for the next partisan talking point.

 

Gramps.. corporations would pass their tax bills onto the consumer by raising their prices, then we the consumer would have to pay taxes on a commodity twice.. unless prices are frozen of course. I dunno.
 
 
Hitler also had a plan...

Your right, but who's to say that they currently don't do that at the higher tax rate? I do in my business so why wouldn't they? Then with a lower tax would that not help prices hold steady?

Just a thought.
 
 
 
Hitler also had a plan...

 

His economic idea's took Germany from a depression that made ours look like a walk in the park(1932) to the most powerful nation by 1938. What has Obama done or Even FDR, which took clear into the 1950's to get back to the 1920 levels?

Who are you guys trying to convince that its bad in its current form?

Every idea or piece of legislation that matters goes through changes.

 

One of my biggest problems with the plan is the National Sales tax. When combined with State Sales Taxes, it is steep. The problem with that is that it opens the door to Black Market competition. It will increase the criminal element in Retail Sales, driving out honest competition. It does it now already. Local Authorities are very poor at weeding this element out. Add in the Illegal Alien factor and it destroys quality of life, unreported Sales, Unreported Income.

But if what you're doing is attempting to catch me in some imagined and exagerated inconsistancy by asking stupid and leading questions then I'll pass.

 

Dude, I'm sorry, I'm not trying to catch you in anything; just asking a question. I hope you accept my sincerity. I say this with sincerity too; it continues to sound like psychological at least in part. I mean, if your plan for 5 years was to have X amount of money and a tax cut comes along and you have an extra $10,000 at the end year one, I don't know about others but I don't bank on getting that extra $10K every year.

Opinions vary and I appreciate you sharing yours. Again, that is sincere.

The dichotomy I see is that nearly every Republican swears that tax cuts grow the economy. Nearly every Republican nowadays swears that our economy is in trouble. So I'm curious why the Republicans are not pounding the drum for a tax cut right now when we arguably need it most.

I just find that to be strange. The only explanation I've heard so far is that it would be politically dis-advantageous for them to do so which I reject on 2 fronts; the fact that tax cuts are politically popular and the fact that I doubt Republicans in Congress are that craven a group. I'm sure about the first part, not so sure about the second.

In my state I have seen the sales tax creep from 4% to 5% to 6% to finally 7%. Each step was painful.

To slap on an additional 9% at the federal level is brutal
 
 
One thing that I don't think has been mentioned in this thread is if the 9% (income tax) includes Social Security and Medicare taxes. If it does then the 9% would not be much if any of an increase at all for even the lowest wage earners.

That does not, however, change the fact that the sales tax portion would, in fact, hit the lowest wage earners hardest.

Keep in mind though, in theory, it replaces the deductions from your pay stub. I say in theory because in the end it's just a new form of taxation that will be increased by one Congress or another as soon as they can get away with it.

Bottom line, Nobody needs to be Budgeting in the Trillions, that needs to stop now. A Flat Tax that we could agree on for the most part, is fair, throwing away the deductions and loop holes. Government needs to stop punishing Small Enterprise while creating special privilege for the Big Conglomerates.

Why not Reward Savings, Impartially, up to a certain amount per Citizen? How about an Interest Rate above the Rate of Inflation?

I disagree. Sales taxes are paid only when someone buys something. Because lower income people have less to spend, obviously the less of the sales tax they will pay.
On the other hand, the lower 48% of of wage earners will not have a stake in the nation. Currently, these people bear no federal tax liability.

On the other hand, the lower 48% of of wage earners will not have a stake in the nation. Currently, these people bear no federal tax liability.

 

While I agree with you about sales taxes being more easy to manipulate for the poor, I do think that sales tax hits them harder than the rich.

If we were talking about only a sales tax and not a sales tax in addition to the income tax, I would be more inclined to support the sales tax over the income tax. On the other hand, this plan does nothing to lower income/FICA taxes for the poor AND it adds the additional burden of a federal sales tax.

The 9-9-9 plan would be heavy handed on the poor. That is not to say that I don't think that the poor should be paying taxes too, but I think this plan is doomed to failure partly because it obviously lowers the tax burden of the rich and it increases the burden on the poor.

Getting that passed would require one hell of a sales job.

Hitler also had a plan...

 

Still haven't learned, have you, dolt?
 
 
So, have our resident conservatives and liberals figured out yet that this is NOT a tax cut for business? Thats Cain's claim of "removing embedded taxes" is false? That it's a tax increase on just about every household that earns less than 50K (considering family of 4)? That it actually taxes labor at 18% (once as revenue for the business and once as income for the earner)? That there are more questions with this idiotic scheme than there are answers? That foriegn goods will be taxed at 18% (once at the point of sale and once as revenue)? That slapping a 9% tax on new homes and new cars is a pretty stupid thing to do when homebuilding and auto sales are already depressed? That it will drive service industries underground and encourage the hiring of more illegal aliens? That given all of that it isn't going to herald any "econiomic boom" and the claims that it will are bullshit. That companies will still have to keep records and do tax assurance and the cost of compliance will not go down appreciably?

The plan sucks.
 
 
 
 
 
One thing that I don't think has been mentioned in this thread is if the 9% (income tax) includes Social Security and Medicare taxes. If it does then the 9% would not be much if any of an increase at all for even the lowest wage earners.

That does not, however, change the fact that the sales tax portion would, in fact, hit the lowest wage earners hardest.

Cain's plan virtually eliminates the US Tax Code. Along with it,the IRS.
The idea of placing a new tax on top of all other existing taxes is not a smart idea for conservative candidates.
I for one would like nothing better than to see the IRS and it's hundreds of thousands of otherwise untouchable federal workers take their expertise into the private sector.

Cain's plan does nothing to the IRS, thier will still be an IRS, their will still be audits, there will still be incometaxes.
