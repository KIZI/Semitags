The Riyadh-based Islamic Solidarity Federation on Sunday called off the athletic
games planned for Tehran in April because of Iran's use of the term "Persian
Gulf" on winners' medals.

The ISF, headed by Saudi Olympic Federation president Prince Sultan bin Fahd,
said after an emergency board meeting that Iran's local organising committee
"unilaterally took some decisions without asking the federation by writing some
slogans on the medals and pamphlets of the games."

Iran "did not abide by the rules of the Islamic Solidarity Sports Federation
(ISSF)" and "did not follow the decisions taken by the general assembly of the
federation at a previous meeting in Riyadh," it said in a statement.

The games were being called off because of the dispute, the ISF said.

Iran's committee for the games criticised the decision through its website.

"In spite of convincing arguments made to the ISSF executive committee (by
Iran's committee), regrettably and without presenting any logical reasons, the
ISSF committee decided not to hold the games with Iran as the host," it said.

Swine flu worries and the dispute over Tehran's insistence on using "Persian
Gulf" for the waters between Iran and the Arabian peninsula had already caused
the games to be postponed since an initial planned date of last October.

The Arab countries of the oil-rich region insist on the term "Arabian Gulf" or
simply the "Gulf."

It would have been the second time the games were held after a first tournament
was held in the Saudi Red Sea city of Jeddah in 2005.
