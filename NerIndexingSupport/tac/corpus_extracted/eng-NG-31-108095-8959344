All good things must come to an end, and so it is with ASU's winning streak.

After Michigan, does it really matter?  :-)

From here, it wasn't a bad day: Maryland won, and PSU and ND lost.  Can't
complain.

OHOWIHATE OHIOSTATE !!

Just FYI, the Fighting Illini were alone atop the Big10
standings for a couple of hours this afternoon. ;-)

And I'm wondering, what was the spread on that 37-10
spanking the Tar Heels took down in South Florida ?

Well we were hoping for an undefeated season, but I guess we'll have to
setttle for an almost undefeated season?

Op  --Oh yeah, congrats to the Maryland Turtles!  My Wolfpack also lost to
Clemson :~^ (  Of course it could have been a worse day--Carolina could have
won--

Might even make it through the little 10 undefeated if they can handle
Purdue and MSU, but don't get too excited, they don't get to play their bowl
game against a little 10 school.

Geaux Tigers!

Shows ya how closely I follow the Terps.  Must have misread the
crawl.  Or did they pull defeat from the jaws of victory?  Coming from
a school with no significant football presence, I only note the
Maryland teams as being from my home state.

Well, wayno calls North Carolina alma mater and I'm
an alum of the University of Illinois, so that makes
three of us. ;-)

I damn near SPLORK VANG MUed on my morning paper this
morning when I looked at the Harris college football
poll. Illinois at 3-1 got 4 votes in the Harris poll
and there they were down at the very bottom of the
'also receiving votes'. Sounds to me like there's four
voters in the Harris poll who are voting while stoned.

BTW - that other ASU is now in the top 25. Go Sun Devils. Trivia question:
when you put www.asu.edu in the browser window, where does it go?

at 3-1, you might have more victories that Wayno's alma mater will acquire
in it's first year guided by Butch "By God, this is worse than I imagined!"
