I keep hearing that we will win in Iraq... so.... when the dust settles what will we have won? Peace? Does anyone really believe that? Has there ever been a time in the recorded history of the world that there wasn't a war going on somewhere?

What will we have to hold in our hands as proof of victory?

Any ideas?
 
 
I think that when we have built a fort around the oil fields, with nobody allowed to approach but soldiers and workers, we will have won. Then we can take off our Robin Hood tights and get back to the business of McDonalds hamburgers and Walmart's neat Chinese goods.
 
 
You forgot Coca-Cola.

We will know conclusively, not as a good guess, that there is not a mad dictator in Iraq secretly amassing doomsday weapons.
 
 
We will know that I-rack is temporarily a democratic nation with more opporunities and freedoms....

However how that affects me and my family/community/state/country I don't know. But it's for a good cause. I think.
 
 
We will probably end up with another Yugoslavia.
 
 
More like Saudi Arabia or Iran, I think.
 
 
What do you consider winning??

May statement is unquestionably true as stated. Before we went in, we could only guess what Hussein was or wasn't doing with WMD. Now we know that there is neither a dictator nor WMD programs there. These facts are in the public domain and not open to debate.

I am assuming that you mean that there will soon be another mad dictator in Iraq who will resume the quest for WMD. Can you offer some evidence to support this prediction?

Even were that true, it in no way supports the idea that there will be a new dictator, potentially hostile to the US, in Iraq, who will resume the search for WMD, which is apparently your thesis. My original answer stands, since you cannot support your position. We have accomplished certainty that there is not a mad dictator in Iraq pursuing doomsday weapons whereas before we could only speculate as to whether he had destroyed them and stopped research. We went from guessing to knowing. Nothing you have said negates this. That is quite a lot to accomplish.
 
 
The USA traditionally creates most of the dictators that come to rage in its nightmares.
 
 
uhhh, "mad dictator" gone, and WMD myth debunked.
Please elaborate on the concept of "victory" to this simpleton, because with these two issues already settled, has victory not already been reached....by your definition?
 
 
A better evaluation of the Iraq debacle is a cost benefit analysis as it relates independently to the following:
1. The US as a nation
2. Joe or Mary American
3. The American ruling elite
4. The American military

I think you will find excessive costs that are left unbalanced by marginal (if any) benefit.

As you wish, simpleton. The question asked was not whether there is more that ought to be done. The question was what will have been achieved, and I gave an example of something significant, thus answering the question asked.
 
 
On the contrary. What was asked was "What will we have to hold in our hands as proof of victory?"
To which you predictably cut and pasted from your "response to the Iraq war" template.
What BVT was asking is since the administration continually prods the American people to support this conflict, and has once prematurely announced that the war was over, qualitatively or quantitatively, subjectively or objectively, what constitutes a "victory".
If you respond again from said template, let me put this in in advance; Saddam is gone and WMD myths have been debunked. Does this constitute an American victory? If so, why is there still an occupational American military presence in Iraq?

and the thread title is "What Will We Have Won."

I answered this question clearly, and unambiguously, whether you choose to acknowledge my words or not. What we will have won is a transition from uncertainty about whether an evil dictator in Iraq still has doomsday weapons and development programs to certainty that that is not the case. That is the primary thing we will have won. Stating it's from a template is irrelevant. The only relevant analysis is whether I'm correct or incorrect. He asked what we will have won and I mentioned something significant and worthwhile.

You want to discuss certainty vs. uncertainty in a thread about what was "won" in Iraq. You can't possibly believe that certainty or stability has become the status quo since the US led invasion.

 
Stating it's from a template is irrelevant. The only relevant analysis is whether I'm correct or incorrect. He asked what we will have won and I mentioned something significant and worthwhile.
 

....and I believe that you are incorrect due to the fact that you refer to your response template rather than referring to anything rational, logical, factual, measurable, empirical or otherwise.
That we can predict with 100% accuracy what your respose will be vis a vis the Iraq conflict is not (as Bush and his handlers would defend) a virtue, it's illustrative of selective acceptance of current events and inticates severe philosophical impediment.

My personal merits or demerits are irrelevant and can't be used to discredit my ideas, no matter how much you wish to avoid debating my ideas themselves. My assertion is that prior to the invasion, there was a very real possibility that Hussein had not destroyed all WMD or WMD development programs, and now there is no possibility of that. It is a very significant benefit to know that one dictator/country at least will not be amassing doomsday weapons. Now either debate the idea itself or concede defeat.
 
 
There was no possibility of WMDs in Iraq at the time of the attack. This was becoming more and more apparent in the weeks before Bush charged ahead. Iraq was cooperating with the inspectors until Bush told them to get out so he could shock and awe the nation into submission. Bush and his supporters were the only ones on Earth unable to see how stupid that was.
 
 
Here is an Atlantic Monthly article on the thread's subject.
 http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200512/iraq-withdrawal 
 
 
 
There was no possibility of WMDs in Iraq at the time of the attack.
 

I absolutely dispute this, since he had had these things and had a long history of non-cooperation with inspectors. Please support your assertion with an argument, not a link.
 
 
The link is not in reply to you, but blueveinedthingamabob.

Anybody watching the news during the months preceding the attack had ample opportunity to see that what I said is true. If the Bush people said, the WMDs are in such and such place in Iraq, the inspectors were allowed to go there and search to their hearts content, until Bush said get those inspectors out of there. It was on all the news channels. Surprised you didn't notice.
 
 
 
My personal merits or demerits are irrelevant and can't be used to discredit my ideas, no matter how much you wish to avoid debating my ideas themselves.
 

But my dear firend, it is you precious "ideas" (or, "idea") that I am attmpting to discredit.
That you and this current administration believe that there was a real possibility that Hussein had WMD was based on a prejudiced and biased response to any such questions he could have come up with vis a vis WMD.
A flawed premise simply can not result in a valid conclusion.

 
Now either debate the idea itself or concede defeat.
 

This is not a thread in which I am attempting to emerge victorious Brandon. It is aparent to me and everyone on this board that your mantra has been well rehersed and propaganda has become true belief.
The loser is not going to be me, for it is you who fails on every occasion to be bothered by any facts on the matter.
I do not lose anything when that happens.

I certainly do assert that he might have still had WMD and development programs at the time of the invasion. If you believe that this is false, then please give a reason, or, indeed, no matter what rationalization you use, you will have lost the argument, whether you think you are competing or not.
 
 
Brandon, you are out of it. I have nothing more to say directly to you.
 
 
 
Brandon, you are out of it. I have nothing more to say directly to you.
 

Of course you don't. I'm not surprised. You make a clear and simple assertion:

 
There was no possibility of WMDs in Iraq at the time of the attack.
 

...and when asked to support it with an argument, storm off in a huff, declaring that your debating opponent is not worth answering. Odd behavior for someone "in the right" on a forum where debate is the norm. If you post a challenge to my idea, but refuse to support it with evidence or an argument, then you lose.
 
 
I didn't storm off in a huff. I see the rigidity of your statements to others. You leave no room for discussion. I will always be here, just not going to wrangle endlessly while you say the same thing over and over and then accuse others of not wanting a discussion.

You wonder why no one wants to debate anything with you.
You claim that they storm off in huff, yet leave no room for rational debate.
You're so hung up on emerging victorious and are so steadfast in maintaining the validity of proven falshoods that no amount of logic and no mountain of facts will suffice.
I too have no time to discuss any such matters with any such individual.

Edgar, check your pm.

The pipleline is nearly complete is it not?
 
 
 
I said that by invading we gained certainty that Iraq had no WMD.
 

So, what did that get us? Because we invaded we got assurance of something? When the whole time Iraq was never a threat to us even if they did have WMDs... It just makes no sense... The average Joe on the street knew Iraq wasn't a threat to the United States. Even if they did have WMD's, they could never have delivered, and that was common knowledge before the war.

Then why do you begin a conversation with me by answering my posts and asking me to answer your questions?

 
uhhh, "mad dictator" gone, and WMD myth debunked.
Please elaborate on the concept of "victory" to this simpleton, because with these two issues already settled, has victory not already been reached....by your definition?
 

On the contrary, you answer my posts here, alright, and request that I answer your challenge to my logic, and then, when asked to support your view, state that I am beneath response. You have not merely lost the argument, but done so in a dishonest way.

As I said, what we have won by invading is certainty that Hussein is not amassing WMD and trying to perfect them. Anyone who challenges this assertion should be prepared to give evidence for what he says.
 
 
 
 
I said that by invading we gained certainty that Iraq had no WMD.
 

... Even if they did have WMD's, they could never have delivered, and that was common knowledge before the war.
 

They could have delivered them. All they had to do was take them apart, smuggle the pieces into an American city, and re-assemble them.

What makes you think they would have done that? This is a country that has never even threatened us. Iraq has been more friendly to us that some countries we call allies, should we invade them next. Just having weapons isn't an international crime. Every country has the rite to defend themselves. And is always amazes me that the very weapons that we were concerned about we have in our own arsenal and more! Hell, we gave them to Iraq... We have used them too! Should someone be justified in coming in to disarm us? Why not, because we are special?

I am first of all pointing out that your statement that they have no capability to deliver is incorrect. It is incorrect because of the suitcase bomb scenario I mentioned.

Your other questions certainly deserve an answer, but I simply lack the time at this moment.
 
 
 
I didn't storm off in a huff. I see the rigidity of your statements to others. You leave no room for discussion. I will always be here, just not going to wrangle endlessly while you say the same thing over and over and then accuse others of not wanting a discussion.
 

To state that you don't want to engage a particular individual in debate is your right. However, to claim the right to answer an individual's posts, and tell him that he's wrong, but the freedom from having to support any of your statements is merely dishonest.
 
 
 
We will know that I-rack is temporarily a democratic nation with more opporunities and freedoms....

However how that affects me and my family/community/state/country I don't know. But it's for a good cause. I think.
 

It probably is a good cause. But wasn't Vietnam also a good cause? The US was trying to prevent communism in that country-and failed. And today, tourists go to Vietnam on holidays. Vietnamese people go overseas on holidays- I know because I've met them. They also emigrate from Vietnam to other countries- I know because I've met alot of them. Those that emigrate go back to visit their families-I know because I know some that do it now. So what exactly did over a million people die for in that war.
 
 
Anyone that doubts the preponderance of evidence of WMD's prior to the invasion of Iraq is doing nothing more than ignoring the evidence. It doesn't matter that it has been proven right or wrong now. Using what we know now and applying it to what we knew then is a pointless tactic with no merit.

The US was right to invade then, and we are right to stay now. Anti-war people will continue to be anti-war people and no amount of discussion or debate will ever change that.
 
 
But you're asking us to heed evidence that was created and propagandized by this administration.
That's like asking Germans for proof of the inherent evil in the Jews. They have no other authority to appeal to other than that which is provided by a "trusting" government agency.
If there truly was overwhelming evidence of a successful and threatening WMD program, it does not explain why so many past American allies were hesitant to hop on the back of the coalition's bus.
Just like so many intellectuals on this board are skeptical of statements such as "reports of..." and "allegations about...." and "allegedly....", and "intelligence gathered by anonymous sources...", many leader of free nations had more faith in the (and say all you want about the organization) UN than they did in the Shrub's blatent bias toward Iraq.

When faced with a clear, present and imminent threat, rational and logical mi ds make sound decisions. When faced with hypothetical scenarios (like "suitcase bombs being imported from Iraq/Saddam to destroy America) and hysterical conjecture, irrational individuals will accept at face value any facts that support their prejudice or philosophy.

Upon seeing the satellite images of "portable biological WMD labs", many of us called bullshit immediately...and every time the terror alert was raised, some of us didn't allow our puppet strings to knee jerk us into hysteria.

Brandon makes an appeal to the mountains of "evidence" in favor of an invasion, yet fails to acknowledge that all the intelligence he still maintains was legitimate has in all instances turned out false. You simply can not expect to gain any respect from rational individuals when you continually appeal to invalid premises to support an equally invalid conclusion.
 
 
You tell 'em Wilso.

I dispute your claim that the WMD myths have been "debunked." The legitimate question that remains is "what happened to the WMD." Beyond that, there is still an American military presence in Iraq because the military force of the new Iraqi goverment is not yet up to the task of maintaining control without the assistance of the US military.

A flawed premise simply can not result in a valid conclusion.
 

In response to any and all inferences that the belief that Saddam had WMD (a question which I do not think has been settled conclusively, particularly since we know he did have them, and there is a good chance he spirited WMD away to Syria), was solely held by the Bush Administration, I remind you of the joint resolution of Congress, Public Law 102-1:

 
Joint Resolution to Authorize the Use of United States Armed Forces Against Iraq

Whereas in 1990 in response to Iraq's war of aggression against and illegal occupation of Kuwait, the United States forged a coalition of nations to liberate Kuwait and its people in order to defend the national security of the United States and enforce United Nations Security Council resolutions relating to Iraq;

Whereas after the liberation of Kuwait in 1991, Iraq entered into a United Nations sponsored cease-fire agreement pursuant to which Iraq unequivocally agreed, among other things, to eliminate its nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons programs and the means to deliver and develop them, and to end its support for international terrorism;

Whereas the efforts of international weapons inspectors, United States intelligence agencies, and Iraqi defectors led to the discovery that Iraq had large stockpiles of chemical weapons and a large scale biological weapons program, and that Iraq had an advanced nuclear weapons development program that was much closer to producing a nuclear weapon than intelligence reporting had previously indicated;

Whereas Iraq, in direct and flagrant violation of the cease-fire, attempted to thwart the efforts of weapons inspectors to identify and destroy Iraq's weapons of mass destruction stockpiles and development capabilities, which finally resulted in the withdrawal of inspectors from Iraq on October 31, 1998;

Whereas in 1998 Congress concluded that Iraq's continuing weapons of mass destruction programs threatened vital United States interests and international peace and security, declared Iraq to be in "material and unacceptable breach of its international obligations" and urged the President "to take appropriate action, in accordance with the Constitution and relevant laws of the United States, to bring Iraq into compliance with its international obligations" (Public Law 107-243);

Whereas Iraq both poses a continuing threat to the national security of the United States and international peace and security in the Persian Gulf region and remains in material and unacceptable breach of its international obligations by, among other things, continuing to possess and develop a significant chemical and biological weapons capability, actively seeking a nuclear weapons capability, and supporting and harboring terrorist organizations;

Whereas Iraq persists in violating resolutions of the United Nations Security Council by continuing to engage in brutal repression of its civilian population thereby threatening international peace and security in the region, by refusing to release, repatriate, or account for non-Iraqi citizens wrongfully detained by Iraq, including an American serviceman, and by failing to return property wrongfully seized by Iraq from Kuwait;

Whereas the current Iraqi regime has demonstrated its capability and willingness to use weapons of mass destruction against other nations and its own people;

Whereas the current Iraqi regime has demonstrated its continuing hostility toward, and willingness to attack, the United States, including by attempting in 1993 to assassinate former President Bush and by firing on many thousands of occasions on United States and Coalition Armed Forces engaged in enforcing the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council;

Whereas members of al Qaida, an organization bearing responsibility for attacks on the United States, its citizens, and interests, including the attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, are known to be in Iraq;

Whereas Iraq continues to aid and harbor other international terrorist organizations, including organizations that threaten the lives and safety of American citizens;

Whereas the attacks on the United States of September 11, 2001 underscored the gravity of the threat posed by the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction by international terrorist organizations;

Whereas Iraq's demonstrated capability and willingness to use weapons of mass destruction, the risk that the current Iraqi regime will either employ those weapons to launch a surprise attack against the United States or its Armed Forces or provide them to international terrorists who would do so, and the extreme magnitude of harm that would result to the United States and its citizens from such an attack, combine to justify action by the United States to defend itself;

Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 678 authorizes the use of all necessary means to enforce United Nations Security Council Resolution 660 and subsequent relevant resolutions and to compel Iraq to cease certain activities that threaten international peace and security, including the development of weapons of mass destruction and refusal or obstruction of United Nations weapons inspections in violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 687, repression of its civilian population in violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 688, and threatening its neighbors or United Nations operations in Iraq in violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 949;

Whereas Congress in the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution (Public Law 102-1) has authorized the President "to use United States Armed Forces pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 678 (1990) in order to achieve implementation of Security Council Resolutions 660, 661, 662, 664, 665, 666, 667, 669, 670, 674, and 677";

Whereas in December 1991, Congress expressed its sense that it "supports the use of all necessary means to achieve the goals of United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 as being consistent with the Authorization of Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution (Public Law 102-1)," that Iraq's repression of its civilian population violates United Nations Security Council Resolution 688 and "constitutes a continuing threat to the peace, security, and stability of the Persian Gulf region," and that Congress, "supports the use of all necessary means to achieve the goals of United Nations Security Council Resolution 688";

Whereas the Iraq Liberation Act (Public Law 105-338) expressed the sense of Congress that it should be the policy of the United States to support efforts to remove from power the current Iraqi regime and promote the emergence of a democratic government to replace that regime;

Whereas on September 12, 2002, President Bush committed the United States to "work with the United Nations Security Council to meet our common challenge" posed by Iraq and to "work for the necessary resolutions," while also making clear that "the Security Council resolutions will be enforced, and the just demands of peace and security will be met, or action will be unavoidable";

Whereas the United States is determined to prosecute the war on terrorism and Iraq's ongoing support for international terrorist groups combined with its development of weapons of mass destruction in direct violation of its obligations under the 1991 cease-fire and other United Nations Security Council resolutions make clear that it is in the national security interests of the United States and in furtherance of the war on terrorism that all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions be enforced, including through the use of force if necessary;

Whereas Congress has taken steps to pursue vigorously the war on terrorism through the provision of authorities and funding requested by the President to take the necessary actions against international terrorists and terrorist organizations, including those nations, organizations or persons who planned, authorized, committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001 or harbored such persons or organizations;

Whereas the President and Congress are determined to continue to take all appropriate actions against international terrorists and terrorist organizations, including those nations, organizations or persons who planned, authorized, committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such persons or organizations;

Whereas the President has authority under the Constitution to take action in order to deter and prevent acts of international terrorism against the United States, as Congress recognized in the joint resolution on Authorization for Use of Military Force (Public Law 107-40); and

Whereas it is in the national security of the United States to restore international peace and security to the Persian Gulf region;

Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This joint resolution may be cited as the "Authorization for the Use of Military Force Against Iraq".

SEC. 2. SUPPORT FOR UNITED STATES DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS

The Congress of the United States supports the efforts by the President to--

(a) strictly enforce through the United Nations Security Council all relevant Security Council resolutions applicable to Iraq and encourages him in those efforts; and

(b) obtain prompt and decisive action by the Security Council to ensure that Iraq abandons its strategy of delay, evasion and noncompliance and promptly and strictly complies with all relevant Security Council resolutions.

SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES.

(a) AUTHORIZATION. The President is authorized to use the Armed Forces of the United States as he determines to be necessary and appropriate in order to

(1) defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq; and

(2) enforce all relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions regarding Iraq.

(b) PRESIDENTIAL DETERMINATION.

In connection with the exercise of the authority granted in subsection (a) to use force the President shall, prior to such exercise or as soon there after as may be feasible, but no later than 48 hours after exercising such authority, make available to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate his determination that

(1) reliance by the United States on further diplomatic or other peaceful means alone either (A) will not adequately protect the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq or (B) is not likely to lead to enforcement of all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq, and

(2) acting pursuant to this resolution is consistent with the United States and other countries continuing to take the necessary actions against international terrorists and terrorist organizations, including those nations, organizations or persons who planned, authorized, committed or aided the terrorists attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001.

(c) WAR POWERS RESOLUTION REQUIREMENTS. --

(1) SPECIFIC STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION. -- Consistent with section 8(a)(1) of the War Powers Resolution, the Congress declares that this section is intended to constitute specific statutory authorization within the meaning of section 5(b) of the War Powers Resolution.

(2) APPLICABILITY OF OTHER REQUIREMENTS. -- Nothing in this resolution supersedes any requirement of the War Powers Resolution.

SEC. 4. REPORTS TO CONGRESS

(a) The President shall, at least once every 60 days, submit to the Congress a report on matters relevant to this joint resolution, including actions taken pursuant to the exercise of authority granted in section 2 and the status of planning for efforts that are expected to be required after such actions are completed, including those actions described in section 7 of Public Law 105-338 (the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998).

(b) To the extent that the submission of any report described in subsection (a) coincides with the submission of any other report on matters relevant to this joint resolution otherwise required to be submitted to Congress pursuant to the reporting requirements of Public Law 93-148 (the War Powers Resolution), all such reports may be submitted as a single consolidated report to the Congress.

(c) To the extent that the information required by section 3 of Public Law 102-1 is included in the report required by this section, such report shall be considered as meeting the requirements of section 3 of Public Law 102-1.

Do you need to be reminded of the beliefs of all of the Democrats in the United States that also held that belief? I can provide you with those. Just let me know.

 
 
Now either debate the idea itself or concede defeat.
 

This is not a thread in which I am attempting to emerge victorious Brandon. It is aparent to me and everyone on this board that your mantra has been well rehersed and propaganda has become true belief.
The loser is not going to be me, for it is you who fails on every occasion to be bothered by any facts on the matter.
I do not lose anything when that happens.
 

It is apparent to me and everyone on this board that Brandon's previous responses in this thread are spot on, and your stubborn refusal to admit even the most obvious facts is telling.
 
 
 
 
I said that by invading we gained certainty that Iraq had no WMD.
 

So, what did that get us? Because we invaded we got assurance of something? When the whole time Iraq was never a threat to us even if they did have WMDs... It just makes no sense... The average Joe on the street knew Iraq wasn't a threat to the United States. Even if they did have WMD's, they could never have delivered, and that was common knowledge before the war.
 

What makes sense to you? Sitting back and taking the word of madman Saddam that he's in compliance? Sitting on our hands and trusting that he's not continuing to play the same games with the UN inspectors he'd played for a decade? That didn't make any sense then, and still doesn't.
 
 
 
 
They could have delivered them. All they had to do was take them apart, smuggle the pieces into an American city, and re-assemble them.
 

What makes you think they would have done that? This is a country that has never even threatened us. Iraq has been more friendly to us that some countries we call allies, should we invade them next. Just having weapons isn't an international crime. Every country has the rite to defend themselves. And is always amazes me that the very weapons that we were concerned about we have in our own arsenal and more! Hell, we gave them to Iraq... We have used them too! Should someone be justified in coming in to disarm us? Why not, because we are special?
 

This is a country that tried to assassinate our president. This is a country that had repeatedly violated the no fly zones, and fired upon our military aircraft in violation of the terms of the Gulf War 1 treaty. Iraq having certain weapons absolutely was a crime.
 
 
 
But you're asking us to heed evidence that was created and propagandized by this administration.
That's like asking Germans for proof of the inherent evil in the Jews. They have no other authority to appeal to other than that which is provided by a "trusting" government agency.
If there truly was overwhelming evidence of a successful and threatening WMD program, it does not explain why so many past American allies were hesitant to hop on the back of the coalition's bus.
Just like so many intellectuals on this board are skeptical of statements such as "reports of..." and "allegations about...." and "allegedly....", and "intelligence gathered by anonymous sources...", many leader of free nations had more faith in the (and say all you want about the organization) UN than they did in the Shrub's blatent bias toward Iraq.

When faced with a clear, present and imminent threat, rational and logical mi ds make sound decisions. When faced with hypothetical scenarios (like "suitcase bombs being imported from Iraq/Saddam to destroy America) and hysterical conjecture, irrational individuals will accept at face value any facts that support their prejudice or philosophy.

Upon seeing the satellite images of "portable biological WMD labs", many of us called bullshit immediately...and every time the terror alert was raised, some of us didn't allow our puppet strings to knee jerk us into hysteria.

Brandon makes an appeal to the mountains of "evidence" in favor of an invasion, yet fails to acknowledge that all the intelligence he still maintains was legitimate has in all instances turned out false. You simply can not expect to gain any respect from rational individuals when you continually appeal to invalid premises to support an equally invalid conclusion.
 

Created and propagandized by this administration? That's BS. You are once again using current intelligence and applying it to past intelligence. It was wrong (although the missing WMD's are still missing). That's it. The reason we know that now is DIRECTLY a result of the invasion.

The pre-war intelligence from so many governments, not just the US, is the reason why the UN had so many resolutions about WMD's in Iraq. The pre-war intelligence, past uncooperation by Saddam, missing WMD's and the threat posed by terrorism were too great to leave alone. No amount of anti-war rhetoric will change that.

The intelligence WAS legitimate. At the time.
 
 
 
It was wrong (although the missing WMD's are still missing).
 

I will have my cake, i will... and i shall eat it, too... so there...
 
 
 
It was wrong (although the missing WMD's are still missing).
 

The other day, upon the stair
I met a man who wasn't there
He wasn't there again to day
Oh how i wish he would go away.

Oh Lord, you are a veritable fund of unintended hilarity...
 
 
Ticomaya, those no fly zones were on their home soil by the way. They were defending themselves from us... As far as them trying to assassinate our president, well we tried to assassinate their president, so we still were never provoked.
 
 
 
Created and propagandized by this administration? That's BS.
 

Then where did the mountain of evidence come from? If, as you say,

 
The intelligence WAS legitimate. At the time.
 

then it never was in fact legitimate.
You are in a clear contradiction.
That I once believed in Santa Claus and saw him in the malls, had my parents tell me about him, and saw telltale signs of cookie crumbs on the fireplace does not make the belief true at the time.
It is a true belief, but empirically speaking, it was and always will be a false and invalid belief.
 
 
Keep making excuses for Saddam. Maybe you will a nice cozy place in the next life as a result.

It makes a hell of a lot more sence than going to war!
 
 
 
Maybe you will a nice cozy place in the next life as a result.
 

A little more coherence, if you please.
 
 
 
Keep making excuses for Saddam. Maybe you will a nice cozy place in the next life as a result.
 

What the hell does that mean? I'm going to hell if I speak the truth? Hey, Saddam was no angel, but Bush got us into this war, not him!

Saddam's WMD's and WMD programs are hardly equatible to Santa Claus. There is NO DOUBT he had them. The only doubt was what did he do with them. He failed to comply with UN resolutions, he failed to account for the WMD's, he failed to accomodate UN inspectors.

Accept that and move on.
 
 
 
 
Keep making excuses for Saddam. Maybe you will a nice cozy place in the next life as a result.

That's right by gum, he failed to account for what no one has ever proven existed, so he deserved to be taken down, and goddamn the tens of thousands of Iraqis who were stupid enough to get in the way.

The lunacy grows apace...

The liberals on A2K, for the most part, have a strong aversion to posting simple, on point arguments. They much prefer, for instance, explaining why supporting their positions is beneath them or their opponent is undeserving of it.

What's left? I've stated that I find your positions baffling. When more evidence appears that the intelligence was manipulated and ya'll keep saying " at the time... at the time.... "

Brandon, I find your continuous "probability/possibility" argument to be fataly flawed. We've debated the point in the past, yet you keep brining it up despite the fact that you're the only one that thinks it has any relevance. You're conducting a Schrodinger's Cat thought experiment, but the whole point of Schrodinger's Cat is that the cat always dies in the real world. In Brandon's WMD experiment, Iraq never has WMD. And the other fatal flaw to your argument is that there were options other than invading. For God's sake, drop it.
 
 
Don't hold your breath waiting for that to happen, he's been peddling that tripe for years, literally...
 
 
I know. Then when you don't agree, he just claims one either doesn't understand or, alternately, is incapable of understanding.

Simple name calling, not accompanied by an actual argument of any sort. If you're going to call your opponent names, at least make a rational argument too. Even an argument that is simple or simple minded, as you assert mine is, can be correct, and your insult does nothing whatever to challenge the truth of my position. I can only conclude that your position is so indefensible that you must avoid actual on point argument and evidence.

I answered the question posed in this thread by asserting that one thing accomplished by the War is to resolve the possibility that a dangerous dictator still maintained doomsday weapons. Which part of that do you disagree with? If you decline to argue rationally, then the only sensible conclusion is that you lose the debate.

We know that Iraq no longer has WMD precisely because we invaded. Had we not invaded, that would still be only speculation. In view of the extreme danger of these weapons, that is a large gain. The thread asks what we have gained by invading.

I don't think that you should be very proud of an absolute unwillingness to present rational arguments to support your position.

A rational debater would, in the face of evidence and facts released by the administration in question, concede defeat and not continually appeal to ex post facto justifications for their current, and inherently flawed, position of the war.
The concept of debate if to provide pillars in support of your main thesis. You have so far illuminated one, and that pillar has in fact, by all standards and by others of your ilk, been proven false.
That I, and millions of other individuals and dozens of nations, knew in advance what it took hundreds of billions of dollars and tens of thousands of lives for you to realize is only strengthens the anti-war analysis of the conflict.
But, again, you can repeat that I just don't get it, or that I haven't provided any fact on the matter....but you can google "pre-war intelligence", or "iraq intel flawed" and find out that your initial suspicions were invalid from their inception....and until the neo-cons can provide us with something tangible, other than conjecture, with respect to the transfer of a massive and elaborate WMD program, then you hold nothing more than a belief or suspicion without a factual basis erecting it.

There comes a time to admit that certain people are unwilling to engage in debate. These folks tend to apply different standards to their own posts than they do to others' posts. They tend to ignore inconvenient questions. They are interested in attacking other, rather than persuading. They tend to retreat into pedantry when called on their crap.
 
 
Brandon, you can pout all you want--i did not call you any names, i described the position you have articulated, ad nauseum, for years as simple-minded. I frankly don't care if you like. Tico and McG and you can get on your high horses all you like--those of us who don't buy your causus belli nonsense are tired of the same faded, shop-worn and bankrupt arguments--so we call them silly, which they are, and don't bother to hash them out with you for the umpteenth time, because it obviously doesn't sink in. Get over it.

Yes. "Obviouolsy." Care to define it or me?

OK, that was a cheap shot. We all make typos.

I find it incomprehensible that a nation with such an extensive "weapons program" could hide such a massive military infrastructure.
 Iraq's Continuing Programs for Weapons of Mass Destruction 

Old beliefs have been demystified:
 Report: Iraq intelligence 'dead wrong' 

But, you're probably right. They probably just trucked it off to Syria unnoticed, or just "buried them in the desert". That is definately a reasoned response.

Brandon, you can pout all you want--i did not call you any names, i described the position you have articulated, ad nauseum, for years as simple-minded. I frankly don't care if you like. Tico and McG and you can get on your high horses all you like--those of us who don't buy your causus belli nonsense are tired of the same faded, shop-worn and bankrupt arguments--so we call them silly, which they are, and don't bother to hash them out with you for the umpteenth time, because it obviously doesn't sink in. Get over it.
 

If that's the case, why did you wade into this thread?

Oh, that's right... to criticize, demean, and flame.
 
 
No, just to amuse myself. You folks demean yourselves every time you put fingers to keyboard--you don't need any help from me.
 
 
 
 
 
That is not a rational argument. Do you understand the concept of debate?
 

...and that is the point we are here making Brandon. Your appeal to rational debate is but an empty call, another expectation that you hold others to but are unwilling to adhere to yourself.
A rational debater would, in the face of evidence and facts released by the administration in question, concede defeat and not continually appeal to ex post facto justifications for their current, and inherently flawed, position of the war.
The concept of debate if to provide pillars in support of your main thesis. You have so far illuminated one, and that pillar has in fact, by all standards and by others of your ilk, been proven false.
That I, and millions of other individuals and dozens of nations, knew in advance what it took hundreds of billions of dollars and tens of thousands of lives for you to realize is only strengthens the anti-war analysis of the conflict.
But, again, you can repeat that I just don't get it, or that I haven't provided any fact on the matter....but you can google "pre-war intelligence", or "iraq intel flawed" and find out that your initial suspicions were invalid from their inception....and until the neo-cons can provide us with something tangible, other than conjecture, with respect to the transfer of a massive and elaborate WMD program, then you hold nothing more than a belief or suspicion without a factual basis erecting it.
 

You must not have read my post....  HERE. 
 

No need to double post Tico. I saw it.
The fact remains that the document you have here cited twice is illegitimate as it hinges much of its advice on faulty intel.
We are here talking about the fact that old evidence has become invalid, and therefore, rendering them a flase belief, based on facts that have been released by the same administration who released the ones you have just cited.
If Bush peddled himself as a heterosexual male during his presidential campaign but later weds Joaquim Phoenix, he is no longer a heterosexual male regardless of what you believed prior to the tying of the knot.
You can't see what you're not willing to see, and no mountain of facts seems to be able to convince you, Brandon or McG.

I understand that you initially believed the intel and you are not being condemned for that. It just defies common sense to not take advantage of hindsight and say that your previous beliefs were false, and are therefore false from that time in history to this point in time and onward.
 
 
 
Tico, if you believe the car salesman but the car ends up being a lemon, do you simply shrug and say, "well, I made a deal" or do you think the car salesman shouldn't have lied?
 

When you have your own mechanic check out the car before you bought it, and it turns out to be a lemon, why do you refuse to acknowledge that your mechanic was wrong too?

But you are not willing to just claim the intel was faulty, you claim it was manipulated, or worse that Bush lied. Prove it. Right now. Put up or shut up.
 
 
But back to what will have been won?
...since the responses for this question have not been pouring in from the war loving right, I'll assume that victory is a nebulous concept for this conflict and that victory is a negligible result of this war.

I know what will be lost.

Faith in the United States of America as a beacon of freedom
Faith in the American military
American lives
Enlistment
Money
Iraqi lives
Presidential support
The democratic process in America
International support for American endeavors.

Have I missed anything?

It's pretty clear that they continued to use certain items of "intelligence" long after they were known to be faulty. I call that manipulation; what would you call it?

Let's talk about faulty intelligence. I haven't been here that long, so I need to know the official Able2Know conservative response to the situation about Wilson and his report about Niger. What I know about it is that Wilson said the report was bogus and a forgery. What I think also happened is that even armed with that knowledge, Bush held that it was in fact true and included it in his State of the Union.

Do I have my facts right?

The mechanic did.
 
 
So, the "mechanic" is the Bush administration? and "I" am the American citizen?
If I have this analogy right, then Tico is claiming that the "Mechanic" has taken a look at the car right?...and what did he find?

If the "Mechanic" is the Bush administration, then why is there a difference in what they claimed upon the first inspection, and what we are now knowing about the car after having put it in our garage?

It's a lemon, and the whole block now smells it's rank odor and hears it's squealing brakes. I would be going after the salesman and the mechanic with tooth and nail for thier deception, or professional ignorance.
I mean, there were telltale signs that this auto could have been a lemon, but I had professionals to aid me in my decision making, and they failed me. Now I'm out a few hundred billion dollars.

If the "mechanic" was Bush, who is the salesman?

No, the "mechanic" is the US Congress. The mechanic looked at the car, and did not find anything wrong with the car. The mechanic recommended that you buy the car. The mechanic signed the purchase agreement. Now, all you want to do is blame the salesman.

No need, it's already been reported under "attack on a member".
I don't tell people to shut up, nor do I employ ad hominem debate tactics. I expect the same in return.
 
 
You think "put up or shut up" is an attack on a member?

...and that is the point we are here making Brandon. Your appeal to rational debate is but an empty call, another expectation that you hold others to but are unwilling to adhere to yourself. A rational debater would, in the face of evidence and facts released by the administration in question, concede defeat...
 

It is invalid and, frankly, odd to try to counter someone's argument by suggesting that they shouldn't have made it in the first place, rather than by referring to the substance of it. You refer to a mountain of logic and evidence supporting your position, yet you never actually mention any of these arguments, but merely suggest that they are well known - once again an invalid argument.

 
...and not continually appeal to ex post facto justifications for their current, and inherently flawed, position of the war.
 

On the contrary, it is you who appeal to ex post facto justifications, since you assert that we need not have invaded, since after invading it became known that there were no WMD.

 
The concept of debate if to provide pillars in support of your main thesis. You have so far illuminated one, and that pillar has in fact, by all standards and by others of your ilk, been proven false...
 

You merely state that it is generally known that it has been proven false, but never reiterate any of this alleged proof. This is not acceptable debating logic.

 
But, again, you can repeat that I just don't get it, or that I haven't provided any fact on the matter....but you can google "pre-war intelligence", or "iraq intel flawed" and find out that your initial suspicions were invalid from their inception....
 

My God, aren't you ashamed to put forth a defense of your position that if I use Google, I will eventually see that you were right? You are supposed to justify your position, not tell me that Google exists.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It certainly cannot be denied that Brandon has a simple argument... simple, almost simple-minded...
 

Simple name calling, not accompanied by an actual argument of any sort. If you're going to call your opponent names, at least make a rational argument too. Even an argument that is simple or simple minded, as you assert mine is, can be correct, and your insult does nothing whatever to challenge the truth of my position. I can only conclude that your position is so indefensible that you must avoid actual on point argument and evidence.

I answered the question posed in this thread by asserting that one thing accomplished by the War is to resolve the possibility that a dangerous dictator still maintained doomsday weapons. Which part of that do you disagree with? If you decline to argue rationally, then the only sensible conclusion is that you lose the debate.
 
 
 

That is not a rational argument. Do you understand the concept of debate?
 

Better than you, I suspect.

 
 

Were that true, you would spend most of your energy defending your ideas, rather than insulting or evading.
 

There comes a time to admit that certain people are unwilling to engage in debate. These folks tend to apply different standards to their own posts than they do to others' posts. They tend to ignore inconvenient questions. They are interested in attacking other, rather than persuading. They tend to retreat into pedantry when called on their crap.
 

Your argument here seems to be that were I rational, I would know that you were right. This is invalid debating logic.
 
 
 
Brandon, you can pout all you want--i did not call you any names, i described the position you have articulated, ad nauseum, for years as simple-minded. I frankly don't care if you like.

OMG, Since I went to bed AT 9:00 the Republicans on this site took over this thread with their drivel and personal atacks and made it a totaly useless.

Well, here's my personal atack. I guess since only 30% of our population support Bush and this war, this represents the bottom feeders of our society. The ones that you just can't reach. The ones that get some kind of sick pleasure out of seing people suffer, unless they are "Their own kind". The Republicans...

Oh man, I can't wait for 2006 congressional elections. Their party is in so much trouble.

This is horsie poop because you're displaying a selective memory. All of us here have provided solid refutation for your paranoid arguments again and again. To come in here each time with the same idiotic argument, and act as if it had not been refuted and laughed to ridicule years gone by is exactly the same tactic the Creationists use when they wait a few dozen pages in a thread and introduce the same specious, invalid arguments against evolution. That is your tactic here, and it is your position which is therefore specious.

Your crapola has been shown to be crapola long ago.
 
 
I feel an obligation to report what seems like inappropriate language directed toward me.

You want to define "put or shut up" and I simply ask to not be told to shut up, regardless of the means by which you intend justify it.

It is not a binary situation where one has certainty or "only guesswork."

The weapons inspectors on the ground reported that Iraq did not have WMD ready to deploy. Saddam Hussein was allowing inspections under threat of invasion.

Do I think we needed a credible threat of invasion to make Saddam knuckle under? Yes.
I do not believe that an actual invasion was necessary to assure that he was unable to attack the US.

So there was not "only guesswork." There was solid information that Hussein did not have WMD. So I do not see that information regarding WMD is a benefit of the war.

You lose... as usual...
 
 
let's just fsay for the sake of argument say that Brandon is right in his assumptions. Balance that against the loss of lives, loss of respect in the world, stretched thin military, bitterly divided citizenry and a due bill that will burden our grandchildren and great grandchildren.

It is not a binary situation where one has certainty or "only guesswork."

The weapons inspectors on the ground reported that Iraq did not have WMD ready to deploy. Saddam Hussein was allowing inspections under threat of invasion.

Do I think we needed a credible threat of invasion to make Saddam knuckle under? Yes.
I do not believe that an actual invasion was necessary to assure that he was unable to attack the US.

So there was not "only guesswork." There was solid information that Hussein did not have WMD. So I do not see that information regarding WMD is a benefit of the war.
 

I believe they reported they could not find any WMD's, not that he had none. Imagine, Saddam Hussein being devious... what were the odds?
 
 
 
 
 
That is not a rational argument. Do you understand the concept of debate?
 

...and that is the point we are here making Brandon. Your appeal to rational debate is but an empty call, another expectation that you hold others to but are unwilling to adhere to yourself. A rational debater would, in the face of evidence and facts released by the administration in question, concede defeat...
 

 
It is invalid and, frankly, odd to try to counter someone's argument by suggesting that they shouldn't have made it in the first place, rather than by referring to the substance of it.
 

NO, you should reexamine your position rather than maintain that invalid past beliefs should still be relevent to discussion.
If I claim "that A" and A turns out to be false, there is little requisite need to continue defending position A.
When the substance of your argument (re: pre-war WMD intel) has no merit, and has been discussed, as Set mentioned, ad nauseum within these fora, then I fail to see the need to continue in this useless banter.
I still recal your initial statement:

 
If you believe that this is false, then please give a reason, or, indeed, no matter what rationalization you use, you will have lost the argument
 

Explicitly stating in advance that "no mater what the rationalization, you will have lost the argument" succintly defines your lack of flexibility and your commitment to denying anything put forth without qualification.

 
You refer to a mountain of logic and evidence supporting your position, yet you never actually mention any of these arguments, but merely suggest that they are well known - once again an invalid argument.
 

I needn't bring up the discussions or links from threads or conversations that I know you personally participated in. Like I said earlier, you can't see what you're not willing to see.

 
 
...and not continually appeal to ex post facto justifications for their current, and inherently flawed, position of the war.
 

On the contrary, it is you who appeal to ex post facto justifications, since you assert that we need not have invaded, since after invading it became known that there were no WMD.
 

No, ex post facto means "after the fact". I had a belief prior to the invasion and that belief is as valid now as it was then. There were other means of determining whether or not Saddam had a flourishing WMD program, but this was not explored, nor does it seem like it was a veritable option.

 
 
The concept of debate if to provide pillars in support of your main thesis. You have so far illuminated one, and that pillar has in fact, by all standards and by others of your ilk, been proven false...
 

You merely state that it is generally known that it has been proven false, but never reiterate any of this alleged proof. This is not acceptable debating logic.
 

We are not here "debating logic", we are debating your illogical and continued support for an invalid premise for war.

 
 
But, again, you can repeat that I just don't get it, or that I haven't provided any fact on the matter....but you can google "pre-war intelligence", or "iraq intel flawed" and find out that your initial suspicions were invalid from their inception....
 

My God, aren't you ashamed to put forth a defense of your position that if I use Google, I will eventually see that you were right? You are supposed to justify your position, not tell me that Google exists.
 

Not in the least. You often tacitly claim debate and intellectual superiority over others and I have faith in your intellectual capacities to find that which you have seen in the recent past as arguments supporting my thesis, to the detriment of your own.
 
 
 
 
I believe they reported they could not find any WMD's, not that he had none. Imagine, Saddam Hussein being devious... what were the odds?
 

  This is akin to requiring accused criminals to prove their innocence, instead of the prosecutor having to prove them guilty.

Usual counter arguments:
1. "Saddam's a murderer, bad guy, blah blah blah." Not good enough. He was a murder, bad guy, blah blah blah before the WMD charges.

2. "We didn't really invade because of the WMD issue." Not good enough. These other reasons existed before Bush & Co. started talking up the WMD issue. The WMD issue is how the war was sold to the public.
 
 
 
OMG, Since I went to bed AT 9:00 the Republicans on this site took over this thread with their drivel and personal atacks and made it a totaly useless.
 

You wanna check the number of personal attacks by leftists compared to conservatives in this thread? Go ahead... you can even count "put up or shut up" as a "personal attack," but you must count Set's calling someone's post as "horsie poop" as a personal attack as well.

Let us know what you find out.
 
 
 
You want to define "put or shut up" and I simply ask to not be told to shut up, regardless of the means by which you intend justify it.
 

Then "put up."

How 'bout, "Put your money where your mouth is." You like that better?
 
 
 
let's just fsay for the sake of argument say that Brandon is right in his assumptions. Balance that against the loss of lives, loss of respect in the world, stretched thin military, bitterly divided citizenry and a due bill that will burden our grandchildren and great grandchildren.

Again I ask, what have we won?
 

You have won the same thing. The question you may want to ask is "has the price been too high?"
 
 
Tico is making sense now.
Care to elaborate on that question?

It is much more congenial, and I would have appreciated that over the former, yes.

It's BPB/BVT's question... I'll let him elaborate on it.

if the price is higher than the gain then we have a net loss. couldn't be simpler.

Your argument here seems to be that were I rational, I would know that you were right. This is invalid debating logic.
 

No, my assertion is that you do not debate; you attempt to brow-beat any opposition to your ideas.
 

Hey, here's an idea. Why don't you stop talking about your assessment of my personal qualities and address the substance of my position? You won't, of course, because you can't.

Here is my position:

What will have been gained is certainty that there will not be a terrible dictator in Iraq amassing doomsday weapons and operating programs to perfect them. Before there was only guesswork.
 

Of course, Brandon is correct. I'm surprised these jokers are still trying to act as though Blix didn't say more than once that Saddam was only behaving because he was under threat--and that Saddam would likely get right back in WMD/terrorist financing soon after the heat was off.

They act as though Saddam and OBL hadn't established a connection. They act as though Salman Pak never existed.

Don't waste your time. They're in denial.

There is a co-worker in the office, who was crest-fallen the other day, when as she was in mid-tirade about how Saddam and OBL would have never worked together--and I simply askled her what made her doubt the 911 Report.

<deer in headlights moment for ignorant Democrat>

She hadn't read it.

She hasn't brought up politics since.

Just face the truth.

Saddam Hussien was a WMD, and he is no longer. He had access to millions. He does no longer.

He had the entire state of Iraq to do with as he pleased--and he pleased to support terrorists--he won't again.

He was a dangerous wildcard with a history of terrorist alliances and a big motive to help terrorists against the US. He will not be a potent threat to anyone again.

That in itself is of immeasurable value.

If we are successful in Iraq, despite the Democrat's wishes, the exponential distribution of human rights, women's rights (of young women and girls, who are treated like animals) and freedom (yeah, I said it) WILL be worth the sacrifices our finest men and women volunteered for. It will continue to change the world--in the same way that recent sweep of democracy did recently. Freedom pays dividends to humanity.

You haters of Christianity should be psyched about wrestling these poor people out of a fundamentalist nightmare and educating them. The double standard re fundy Islam and Christianity is appalling!

Grow a conscience.

Watch and learn.
 
 
 
That in itself is of immeasurable value.
 

And that, in itself, makes the cost "worth it."
 
 
horseshit.
 
 
A nuke suitcase in Manhattan, because of liberal politics, would be horseshit.

taking the time to worry about whether a nuke suitcase was the result of liberal or conservative politics is horseshit and you're busted honey.
 
 
Not busted at all.

The current administration say the threat and addressed it--and continues to address it, over the screaming, hair pulling and unhelpful distraction of the liberals.

The work continues despite them.

Had we left Iraq under pressure of the liberals, their stamp would be on the nuke suitcase. My opinion, anyway.

I'm busted for speaking clearly.
 
 
Taking the fight to the terrorists, addressing the growing threat of islamic fundamentalism in the middle east, sending the clear message to the countries of the world that the US won't tolerate the support of terrorism, ridding the world of a ruthless, maniacal despot in Iraq, chasing down the financial network that supports the terrorists, and taking out the al Qaeda leadership one by one ----> Priceless.

Fiddling while waiting for the next terrorist attack on US soil ----> Horseshit.
 
 
well-rotted horse shit is pretty low in nitrogen so it takes heaps of the shit to make a decent garden, sheep shit is better and chicken shit tends to burn. Democrats shit won't grow shit and republican shit is too expensive for the common working man.
 
 
For really good shit, you need to follow a liberal like Kucinich around for a few days, your flowers and maters will love you.
 
 
Just curious what ever came of Salmen Pak following the invasion?
...and from what I've read about it, this administration maintained that the artifacts from the site had been moved to the Al Hakam BW facility.
Why have we not seen the "proof" of this site splattered all over FoxNews vindicating the initial premise regarding WMD labs?

I still find it difficult to believe that with the surveillance technology available to the United States army and CIA, the mass mobility of such a supposedly large program was done completely undetected.
It must have all been carted into Syria in suitcases.
Louis Vuitton I would presume.
 
 
That's some shit.
 
 
Smoke and mirrors and something about a tiger. Oh wait, that was in Vegas, don't know about eyerak.

The assumption that Gore would have fiddled around while waiting..... unbelievable partisan horseshit.

and I thought bin laden was in afghanistan or has that been successfully rewritten?
 
 
BVT, why do you argue with the crazy people. You know it only encourages them.

Kicky! You entered this thread and didn't even make use of the word "shit." And you had the perfect opportunity. What's the matter with you boy?
 
 
I know...I'm trying to cut down. Hope it didn't throw you off too much.
 
 
kicky--

Did you decide to relocate...? I am looking in to moving to Athens!
 
 
Lash, you speak greek?
 
 
I wish. No, I spoke Georgian.
 
 
well if you're moving to athens perhaps you will learn to roll feta into a grape leaf with your tongue. that would be awesome.

Naaah...I love NYC too much. I cancelled the moving truck the day before I was supposed to leave. It was quite the dramatic moment...wish you could have been here for it.

I did have to move though. Ended up in Queens for the time being. There really is nothing like NYC.

So now I'm thinking Buenos Aires...someday.
