The Celtics are not going to lose 4 straight, sorry. They are going to play the Lakers in the finals, and then collapse!!  
 
 
Lakers in 6......We've got a score to settle.

I'd find myself slapping the Coach of the Bruins that very night after Game 7..

How can you go 3-0 in a Series and then just drop it?
 
 
The Celtics are the only team I like in Mass, because of Indiana's own Larry Bird. Ya all had him for while, but he's ours for life now!  

Plus, if it's one thing Pacer fans hate, are the Lakers. Just like Colts fans hate the Pats.

So, my vote is

GO CELTICS!

I don't know anyone who's fighting about who the Lakers play in the finals> The Lakers will beat ANY team in the Eastern Conference in a 7 game series. The Celtics make it that much better......

Good luck! (you're gonna need it this time!)

Anyone that cares about basketball wants this match-up. The Celtics have won 17 championships and the Lakers have 15. These teams have met 11 times in the finals, this will be the 12th.

Yes Sports Fans - It's gonna be "Showtime" versus "Gang Green" again.....it doesn't get any better than that!!

This year. we've got the equalizer that was missing two years ago, that would be Ron Artest!....As much as I loved Trevor A., Artest brings that certain defensive prowess that was missing in their last series.

No matter what, this will be another classic series for the record books!

Celtics in five. Rondo is too good. He's playing with three sure fire first ballot hall of famers and yet he is the acknowledged leader of the team. The way he played last night redefines how the position of point guard ought to be played.

Rondo is coming into his own, most definitely. But he won't be penetetrating at will on the Lakers bigs the way he is with Orlando. Plus, he's got a cagey veteran in Fisher to deal with, who's been through the wars. Just look at what the great Steve Nash is going through right now.

Plus, we have the best player in the game, Kobe Bryant. Kobe's been waiting two years for this. He won't be denied.

Garnett is the only sure fire first ballot hall of famer on that team. You don't just walk into the HOF.

Pierce flashing gang signs wil be remembered by the voters. Low class moves do not bode well in voting.

It's going to be a great series.....Lakers in six.
 
 
Phoenix giving Lakers all they have right now...

Whoever wins the Western Conference. If Orlando somehow came back, they'd be exhausted. Difference between Bruins and Celtics though is that the Bruins had came back from two down in two games of the three they won to win. Celtics have just been simply dominating.
 
 
Lakers are a bunch of goddamn robots and they have a Zen master for a coach.

no. I get a paycheck from YOU every month. thanks. I proposed a simple friendly wager. so do you want to put any money on the lakers-celtics series or do you just want to sit around and bullshit?

To BOTH of you, there will be no betting of money on the board. You can bet avatars and sigs, but not real $$. Thank you. -EZ

Sure!......But I don't bet money with lib's. Lib's don't pay their bills, let alone bets.

If the celtics win, i'll come up here and give them the props they would deserve. Same goes for you if the Lakers win.

absolutely. I will give them their props now... the Lakers are a hell of a good team. Kobe is, I think, the most talented athlete in the entire league. I happen to believe that the celtics have pulled it all together in an unbelievable way since the middle of the Cleveland series and Rondo is playing at a level I would not have imagined possible. If they lose to the Lakers, it will be because LA executed better and found a way to limit Rondo's effectiveness, IMO.

Cool!.....Same goes for the Celts!....I've been saying all year they are the best in the east. I'm not buying into the Lebron hype......The best two teams will playing in the finals, and that is the way it should be......Although, the Lakers are still in a series. The Suns did a good job last night. As a life long NBA fan, I know it isn't over until it's over. That's why they play seven games. The Suns aren't the Magic. They aren't just going to lay down and Die. The Magic, and especially Van Gundy should be ashamed. Never have I seen a coach give up on his team at halftime in GAME 1......Never have I seen a team completely give up the way the Magic did on saturday......Howard's Superman?..........LMAO!
 
 
Lakers will finally have something to prove if they play the Celtics
 
 
Orlando last year was nothing but a breeze

well, I expected the suns to have more heart than the lakers, since they were down 2-0. which is why I am so disgusted with the Orlando Magic.

Yep.

Yep.

 

i doubt it will be over 20 points

you're assuming orlando has heart. it'll be fun to watch.
 
 
I'm not a great big basketball fan. I liked the Celtics when Larry Bird was playing. Now, not so much. I figure the Lakers will take it all.
 
 
 
 
 
Yep.

 

i doubt it will be over 20 points

i just think it will be a closer game tonight
and so far, it is

I keep hearing them remark about how well Orlando is doing. Considering how they played the first three games, doesn't take much to play better.  
 
 
The Lakers will make their adjustments. That's what a seven game series is all about. There's a reason why Jackson has never lost a seven game series after going ahead 2-0.....He's a great coach, with a great staff!

But like I said, the Suns aren't going to just lay down and die. Unlike Orlando, they've got heart!
 
 
Christopher with the Tequila commercial. Sweet.
 
 
bad move by howard hitting garnett in the face. the momentum seems to be shifting.

orlando... bunch of sandbagging motherfuckers.
 
 
Orlando is not going to get every call under the sun next game. Garnett and Rondo are not going to do nothing, again. Orlando is not going to hit every single three.

This series is done in five, six at best.
 
 
Kiss of death for lakers....

 
President Barack Obama is projecting a Los Angeles Lakers win in the NBA finals.

Obama told TNT in an interview that he’s been surprised by Boston, but believes Kobe Bryant(notes), Pau Gasol(notes) and coach Phil Jackson would be too much for the Celtics.

“I’ve got to go with the Lakers again,” Obama said. “I think Gasol may be the best big man in the league right now. He’s different from Dwight Howard(notes), but he’s (got) unbelievable footwork, speed, savvy, he’s playing magnificently.

 

Everything the Unicorn Rainbow King touches turns to shit........

it'd be great if the suns won the next two games, then.

They do, but don't count on a comeback.

It took Orlando:

Overtime
32 points from Howard
Rondo not showing up
Garnett not showing up
Celtics turning over the ball for no reason
And the bench not showing up.

It's done, tomorrow night.

Of course if they do lose, it won't be Obama's fault....

it will be because of BOOOOOOOSH!!!!!!!!!!!        
 
 
  That would work out nicely, except Obama did pick the NCAA Men's Basketball Champion correctly last year.

I do hope the Suns win though. Easier opponent for Boston.

Really? I have family all over Boston. They'd like nothing better than a chance to beat the best team in the league. Beating the Suns would be like winning by forfeit.....fuck that shit! Bring on the Lake Show!!!!

Celtics/Lakers = Old School Classic - ratings blockbuster.
Celtics/Suns = ratings disaster- Charles Barkley bloviating....bleck!!.

I agree. I've never liked the "easier opponent" deal. When I followed the NBA as a Bulls fan back in the day, I always wanted the Knicks. wouldn't have been right any other way. it'd have been almost like cheating.
plus, Boston vs the lakers is a tradition.
 
 
Missing: Celtics Defense.

Please return to the Lost & Found ASAP.
 
 
Here's hoping Boston can finish it out in Boston for Game 6.  
 
 
Looks like Orlando and Phoenix both decided to make it a series.........

The Lakers DOMINATED the Celtics in game 1. It wasn't even close either. The Celtics never showed up, they fell behind early and never caught up.

Phil Jackson's record in playoff series after winning game 1.... 47-0
OUCH!!! Deal with it.

Good Luck Sunday - I will be there!! WooHoo!!!!
 
 
 
who ya takin?

 

i meant to post this before the series started;

lakers in 5

I'm a celtics fan but I think;

a. kobe REALLY WANTS IT more than the celtics do

b. the lakers REALLY WANT IT more than the celtics do

c. pierce, allen and garnett are a little too old and inconsistant

d. the backup role players are too inconsistant

if the celts, as a team, play their absolute best in 4 games then they could pull it out.

but I don't see that happening.

they could win 1
they might win 2...

but that's it.

I agree with you that the lakers will win it...

however

1 game does not a series make.

MANY times we've seen team A dominate team B in 1 game and then turn around and be dominated in the next.

who ya takin?

 

i meant to post this before the series started;

lakers in 5

I'm a celtics fan but I think;

a. kobe REALLY WANTS IT more than the celtics do

b. the lakers REALLY WANT IT more than the celtics do

c. pierce, allen and garnett are a little too old and inconsistant

d. the backup role players are too inconsistant

if the celts, as a team, play their absolute best in 4 games then they could pull it out.

but I don't see that happening.

they could win 1
they might win 2...

but that's it.

 

Impressive   why not wait until the series is over, THEN post your pick?

If you were truly sure of that, you wouldn't watch. You wouldn't get a little anxious when the Lakers are down 6 at the half on Sunday. You wouldn't have gotten excited when Ron Artest made that game winning shot. In fact, if you and the Lakers were sure, the games wouldn't be close like they are. Hell, Bynum could go down and the Celtics could win the next 3. It isn't impossible. Rasheed Wallace might step up. He's done it before. Rondo might turn back into Robin from Batman & Robin. If he turns into that guy, it could spell trouble. But Gasol is playing well. I liked him better when he was soft. Odom isn't playing well. But I'm sure he will. I'm happy for Artest. He needs a ring. I think he's crazy and maybe a championship will help his confidence and give him a sense of pride and accomplishment. I can't help root for Artest. But Ray Allen and Paul Pierce aren't stepping up. And Boston's bigs aren't hanging with the Lakers Bigs.

But Kobe Bryant has finally hit the point in his career where he can absolutely be compared to Michael Jordan. Just the last 3 years alone he has reached the Finals. I used to hate on Kobe but no longer. Sure I hope the Lakers lose, just like I rooted against the Bulls. But that didn't mean I didn't appreciate watching Jordan. I just like rooting for the underdog. But Kobe, I am now truly a fan. You have proved yourself beyond a shadow of a doubt. Big shots at the end of the game? You or Jordan? I would gladly pick either of you. And you did it without Shaq.
 
 
what is it with Laker fans leaving early. Don't they know anything can happen? What a bunch of shit. I bet Echo remembers this....

WRONG! But the Lakers will probably take one in Boston. If not, IT'S OVER for the Lakers!!! I don't want Kobe to pass Shaq with rings. He needs this one more. LOL.

i hope you didnt bet the farm on that one  
 
 
Here's some recaps on the first 2 games of the series. All leading up to tonigh'ts inevitably tie breaking game 3.

 Game 1- NBA.com 
 
Game 2 - NBA.com 
I'm writing this on behalf of NBA.com, enjoy the vids, It's going to be a great series no matter who wins.

Anyway, I still see the Lakers winning the Series in LA in game 6 or 7, they are simply the better team. We'll know later tonight!! I'll be back to talk smack (or get smacked!!) later....good luck Celtic fans, you'll need it !!

This series is freakin' awesome!!  

Game 5 ought to be a classic. Anyone who is not enjoying these matchups is not a fan........

Prognostication.....
Lakers take game 5 in Boston and win it all back in LA in game 6 or 7. Sorry Celtics fans, the Lakers are simply better than your Celtics this year........

Yep. The Celtics are good but the Lakers are just a little bit better, and the Lakers have the last two games at home. So yeah, I like our odds.

Either way, this is a great series!!

Phenomenal series!

The Celtics haven't played a complete game yet. Granted, the Lakers have a lot to do with that but it's been pretty clear that the Big 3 haven't all shown up for the same game.

What I do know is that the refs swallowed their whistles last night and when they were allowed to play the Celts came out on top.

Bynum is D-O-N-E done.

With him out lanes to the hoop are going to open up and more second chance opportunities will present themselves. Phil will have no choice but play Gasol big, big minutes and pay the price when he fades in the 4th and gets outworked.

The dynamic of the series has changed and Boston has already proven they can win on the road.

All of the momentum shifted to Boston last night.
 
 
If Boston wins two in a row...it's over.

Screw Kobe Bryant. He sucks some serious ass.

He's not the same without Shack.
 
 
When the Laker's win tonight...it's all over!!
 
 
 
When the Laker's win tonight...it's all over!!

No, he's not the problem. Its Gasol, Bynum, odom, artest, walton, sasha,

Boston's bench showed up. Pierce showed up. Ray Allen isn't shining but its not hurting the team. He isn't the focus. Rondo's doing his job. KG did well tonight.

Now they gotta win one in LA.

First, I am a huge KG fan. A Chicago product and a class act.
Second, although I gained a lot of respect for Kobe in representing the US so well and bring home the gold. It's still hard to love the guy, since the MJ comparison are too hard to take! MJ is God in Chicago and I hate the MJ comparison (even if they are warranted in Kobe's case).
Third, I fucking hate Ron Artest, he doesn't deserve a ring.

Of course you are right, but I love talking smack - the outcome is secondary!!  

I hope the Lakers win, but if they don't- I won't lose a second of sleep worrying about it or anything I have said. The games have been exciting and fun to watch, that is all I expect. If these games were blowouts, what fun would that be?

PS: Anyone who thinks that guessing the outcome of an athletic event is some sort of "skill" is mark, just waiting to be fleeced. Anything can happen!

Final Prognostication: Lakers win game 6 and game 7 in front of these gals....

The anticipation is killing me. I don't know how I am getting to bed today.

Personally. after the World Champion Lakers crush the Celtics tonight, I'll sleep like a freakin' baby.    

You (and the other fans of the underdog Celtics) just might have the worst couple of nights of your life waiting for the fourth seeded Celtics to lose game 7! Especially after the momentum dramatically shifts back to the World Champion Lakers. Home court baby!!- they call it an "ADVANTAGE" for a reason.  

Good Luck!!!
 
 
I hate basketball; but don't put money on the Lakers as the Celtics are 11-0 when they have a 3-2 lead in a playoff series.
If u already bet on the Lakers, kiss it good-bye.
Stats like these usually hold up.

Last time I checked, basketball players don't wear hockey skates.
But I do understand your EMO post.
I have no dog in this fight.
I only bet the horses and football, not necessarily in that order.
Being an Eagles fan (hey Philly!), when the Eagles are the dog, at home, against Detroit, it is a 74% chance that the Eags will cover the bet.

Watch da' game, be aware of the stats, and rub it in my face if Lakers win.

The Lakers are the better team and you are seeing it tonight.

I hate the Lakers in the same way I hate the Yankees and especially the clown-bitch Cowboys. I can't stand any team where the locals feel they're "Supposed to win." Meanwhile, there's a peppering of POSERS throughout the country that root for these teams, and rock their hats and jerseys because they think it's cool.

But whaddya gonna do. The Yanks knocked off my Phillies last year and the clown-bitch-homo Cowboys knocked off my Eagles. Hard to stomach but I deal with it.

Me too, and I hate Ron Artest too, for what he did to my Pacers.  

 

I hate the Lakers in the same way I hate the Yankees and especially the clown-bitch Cowboys. I can't stand any team where the locals feel they're "Supposed to win." Meanwhile, there's a peppering of POSERS throughout the country that root for these teams, and rock their hats and jerseys because they think it's cool.

Wow! Sounds like sour grapes from juvenile.  

Keep in mind as you do your "hatin".....it's only a game.

I know, right! Why do I get so worked up over something that really has ZERO effect on my actual life.....   Then go off on a rant and people think I'm a lunatic!
 
 
Hooray!! It is over.

Damn! Doesn't the 2010-2011 season start up in like three weeks?

Why can't the NFL be as long as the NBA season?

Yeah, at least my team (the Colts) always do well, unlike my Pacers,,,,they have sucked ever since Ron Artest ruined them.
 
 
 
Fuck the Lakers and fuck Kobe, the rapist.

 

Just like Ben Roethlistberger, the rapist.

And Peyton Manning, the child molestor.

Always do well?

I don't want to spend time looking up team records, but if I remember correctly there have been years where the Colts were laughingstocks in the NFL, just as my Raiders have been for... well, seems like forever now.  

Remember all players get old and all great teams fall sooner or later. Manning won't be a Colt forever just as Favre is no longer a Packer.

Who the heck is Ron Artest?

But, I do know one good thing about the NBA. Care to know what it is? Hell, I'll tell you anyway... there is no better cure for insomnia than a televised NBA game.

How gracious of you.  
 
 
Game 7 was EPIC!!! It was physical, ugly, intense basketball. It was a cross between a rugby game and a boxing match. Brutal but brilliant. In the end it came down to which team wanted it more -that team was the Lakers. The Lakers dominated the boards and matched the physicality of the Celtics throughout. They never gave up even though they were missing shots left and right. In the end, the better team won.

Celtics fans have nothing to be ashamed of! They should be proud of their team - the Celtics pushed the series to 7 games and they played with a lot of intensity and heart. They were impressive. Ray Allen, Paul Pierce, Rajon Rondo, Kevin Garnet, and the rest of the team can all hold their heads up high. They beat Cleveland and the beat Orlando decisively to get there - two teams with better records - two teams that were "supposed" to beat them. They lost to the best team in Basketball - after 7 great GAMES - and they COVERED THE SPREAD!! They have nothing to be ashamed of, they played with Honor!

PS - to all you Kobe and Laker haters : Face it, you only hate them because they are great. Think about it....... Nobody "hates" the LA Clippers (except for their fans!). Nobody "hates" the Charlotte Bobcats.....Nobody "hates" the Memphis Grizzlies (nobody even knows who they hell they are!) You "hate" the Lakers (and Kobe) because they are FREAKIN' GREAT!!! You "hate" them because your own teams lose to them consistently.

PPS -- Laker and Kobe haters, you're in for a world of hurt - the World Champions Lakers are favorites to THREE-PEAT next year.

Good, can we just cancel the season and give them the trophy? I like my late nights. Doesn't it start in like three weeks?

i agree about Kobe...but hey Art....there is always next year....  
 
 
 
I can't stand any team where the locals feel they're "Supposed to win."

 

well when your team is one of 3-4 that always seem to win it....how are you supposed to feel?....AND Cuy.....when you see fans holding signs saying "BEAT LA"....it just spurs everyone on more....especially the team.....who else gets that kind of honor?....
 
 
Still waiting for Maineman to cover his end of the bet!

Where ya' at, buddy?

LMAO!
 
 
 
 
 
Rondo is coming into his own, most definitely. But he won't be penetetrating at will on the Lakers bigs the way he is with Orlando. Plus, he's got a cagey veteran in Fisher to deal with, who's been through the wars. Just look at what the great Steve Nash is going through right now.

Plus, we have the best player in the game, Kobe Bryant. Kobe's been waiting two years for this. He won't be denied.

Garnett is the only sure fire first ballot hall of famer on that team. You don't just walk into the HOF.

Pierce flashing gang signs wil be remembered by the voters. Low class moves do not bode well in voting.

It's going to be a great series.....Lakers in six.

 

wanna bet?

 

Sure!......But I don't bet money with lib's. Lib's don't pay their bills, let alone bets.

If the celtics win, i'll come up here and give them the props they would deserve. Same goes for you if the Lakers win.

Eh?

 

The Lakers were, without a doubt, the better team in the finals this year. Losing Perkins spread us too thin to compete with Kobe and the gang. The won it fair and square.

Sorry it took so long to pay this bet off... I quite honestly forgot all about it. I am glad you reminded me.

We'll see if we can make the same bet next June.......I'm not sold on the Heat whatsoever. The Celt's are still the team to beat in the east.....It should be quite interesting.

Thanks for holding up your end of the bet. I respect that!

The answer to my prayer would be the cancellation of the next 45 NBA seasons. I figure in 45 years I will be 94 and not really care anyway so they can start back up then.
