PNC Financial Services Group Inc. on Tuesday said it will pay back $7.6 billion in bailout funds to the U.S. Treasury, a sign of confidence in the financial system.

The Pittsburgh-based financial services company received approval to redeem the preferred shares held by the government under the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP.

To fund the repayment, PNC plans to offer $3 billion of its common stock and senior notes totaling $1.5 billion to $2 billion.

PNC will also use cash raised through a $2.3 billion sale of its investment servicing business to Bank of New York Mellon, which was announced earlier in the day.
