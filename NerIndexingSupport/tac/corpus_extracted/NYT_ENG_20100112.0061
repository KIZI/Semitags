Hearst Newspapers Washington bureau has been
previewing this year's midterm elections. Today, we look at the 10
seats in the House and Senate most likely to change party hands.

      The Most Endangered Senate Seats

      NV-Senate Harry Reid (D), incumbent

Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid has reached the top of the
list of endangered incumbents the old-fashioned way: He earned it.

The controversy over his racially insensitive comments about
Barack Obama is just the latest embarrassment to the longtime
incumbent. Polls show his popularity ratings back home in Nevada at
an all-time low. He is trailing three potential Republican
opponents, none of whom are close to Reid in campaign cash or name
recognition. It may not matter. The most powerful Democrat on
Capitol Hill could become the second consecutive Senate Democratic
leader to lose a re-election race.

ND-Senate Byron Dorgan (D), retiring

The popular Democratic senator is retiring and the popular
Republican governor is moving toward becoming a Senate candidate.
Gov. John Hoeven would become a prohibitive favorite, making this
the most likely open Senate seat to change hands.

AR-Senate Blanche Lincoln (D), incumbent

Arkansas has trended very Republican since the Clinton era. Its
senior senator, Blanche Lincoln, could fall victim to changing
times, as well as a voting record that, while moderate, is to the
left of most Arkansans. Her vote for the Senate Democrats'
health-reform plan could be a tough sell.

DE-Senate Ted Kaufman (D), interim senator

Delaware is a very Democratic state, but moderate Mike Castle is
the one and only Republican who can win statewide. He's a popular
former governor and he's about as nonpartisan as is permissible
within the Republican Party. If Attorney General Beau Biden, son of
the VP and former senator, decides to run, Castle would be a slight
favorite. If Biden opts out, Castle is close to a shoo in for the
seat that Kaufman was appointed to following his predecessor's
election as vice president. At the time, Kaufman agreed not to seek
election in 2010.

      The Most Endangered House Seats

      LA-02 Anh "Joseph" Cao (R), incumbent

There's a reason Joseph Cao was the only House Republican to
vote for the Democratic health-care reform plan: His district is
overwhelmingly Democratic. Cao's election in 2008 was a fluke -- he
was running against a convicted felon. Assuming the Democrats don't
end up with a convicted felon again (or engage in a fratricidal
primary between state Reps. Juan LaFonta and Cedric Richmond), Cao
could be a one-term wonder.

TN-06 Bart Gordon (D), retiring

Republican presidential candidate John McCain carried this
Middle Tennessee district by 25 percentage points in 2008 and
incumbent Democrat Bart Gordon saw the handwriting on the wall. He
opted for retirement rather than a very tough re-election contest.
GOP state senator Jim Tracy, who represents much of the district in
the Tennessee legislature, is the instant frontrunner, though other
contenders could include a local party chairman, a military veteran
and a wealthy businessman.

DE-AL Mike Castle (R), running for Senate

If Democrats are going to hold their own in 2010, they must
capture Republican House seats like Delaware's at-large district
being vacated by GOP Senate candidate Mike Castle. This state is
deep blue and former Lt. Gov. John Carney is a strong Democratic
candidate. But Republicans have some respectable options and Castle
might just have some coattails.

NY-23 Bill Owens (D), incumbent

Was Democrat Bill Owens' special House election victory last
year a fluke? Was it the result of a Tea Party rebellion against
moderate Republican Assemblywoman Dede Scozzafava or a sign of the
Democratic trend in upstate New York? Owens is the first Democrat
to represent this upstate New York district in a century. Can he
hold it? The district is moderate and not very partisan (much like
its former representative, Republican John McHugh). If the centrist
freshman can hang on, it'll signal that Democratic setbacks could
be confined to red states.

LA-03 Charlie Melancon (D), running for Senate

Rep. Charlie Melancon's decision to challenge Republican Sen.
David Vitter -- he of D.C. Madam infamy -- gives the GOP a prime
chance to take back a House seat in Cajun country. The colorful
Billy Tauzin, a conservative Democrat-turned-Republican represented
this district for decades. His son was defeated narrowly by
conservative Democrat Melancon. Louisiana is trending red, but
everybody who's thinking of running in this district is a
conservative, so it could end up a conservative "R" or a
conservative "D."

IL-10 Mark Kirk (R), running for Senate

In a normal election year, Democrats should be heavily favored
to take this suburban Chicago House district that has remained in
the GOP column only because its moderate incumbent appealed to
independents and Democratic centrists. This year is shaping up as
an abnormal year, however, and the GOP frontrunners, state Rep.
Beth Coulson and entrepreneur Dick Greenis, might be moderate
enough to hang on -- though Democrats are counting on a takeover
here.
