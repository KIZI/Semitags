The protesters are just a bunch of idiots though, right?
 
 
Another great informative Truthmatters post...          
 
 
from the link in post #6;
"Protesters swelled in front of the Capitol as people converged to rally against Senate Bill 1070 during the day. Some came from as far away as California.

The size of the crowd grew over the course of the afternoon, and estimates by Phoenix police and media varied between 1,500 and about 2,000. By about 5 p.m., most of the crowd had dispersed, but a new wave of about 50 to 100 protesters arrived from Carl Hayden Community High School.

During the day, some of the protesters marched around the building, chanting, "Si se puede," or "We can do it." They were joined by 56 members of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, who arrived by bus."

Does anyone besides me see a problem with people from another state meddling in a state's political process? I would think that the governor might simply dismiss the entire crowd thinking they are all from California and do not represent registered voters of the state.

As an aside, the only people that have been out in the little mountain town I live in are a few local residents that do vote here urging other registered Az voters to call the governor in support of the bill.

Hahaha,

Are you all getting the impression that TM agrees with this protest? Yet she condemns those who protest tax policy in the Tea Party?

Maybe I am wrong, but I get the impression that since this bill is supposedly a conservative bill she thinks the world of these protesters.

TM here is a little bit of information I have picked up over the last few years. Now this is my impression so you have to go off of my statements and I can't prove it or link to it, but people are angry in the following states:

* Alabama
* Alaska
* Arizona
* Arkansas
* California
* Colorado
* Connecticut

* Florida

ACORN Astroturfy Protest

 
 
 
 
Is this an ESP test?
 
Yes--it's another TM classic----if you cannot read her mind you are stupid

and--there is ho hidden agenda in it anywhere

I was just in Arizona for a sales conference! I can say, that the people were estatic about it. However, they are the ones that work, not the ones that have time all day to bitch and complaint.

See when people work, they can't just take off to beat drums and bitch. But when people don't work they can complain as much as they want.

I also went to school in Arizona, believe it or not illegal immigration has led to an insane amount of crime. Not one person I know didn't have their bike ripped off. Too many of my friends had their car stole and broken into. At my frat house I had to fight a few wetbacks breaking into our house to steal shit and we were right on campus.

A few of my friends from Tucson had parents with family farms. Exact words, "we couldn't get a dog, because they always killed it." They consistently cut the wire on their fences so all the livestock escaped. It was dangerous to go outside at night, especially if you're female. Lastly garabage and trash is EVERYWHERE!"

The Southern part of Arizona is a war zone brought on specifically by illegal immigrants. Hospitals in Tucson BLOW and are overly expense because of the free healthcare they must give to illegal immigrants.

Enough is enough with this SHIT!!! Being anti-illegal immigration is SO MUCH different than anti-immigrations! Small minded people like you lump them together because you have no argument, so you rely on the race card!!!
 
 
They live in the desert, how happy can they be?
 
 
Damn!!

I went back and counted that list of states and I can only count 50. Since President Obama stated there were 57 states, I'm missing seven frigging states!

Can y'all help me figure out which ones I'm missing.

I had no say when Ca passed laws about having to wash your vehicle to make it through their port of entry if your car has been in certain areas, or the split speed limit for big trucks on CA freeways, or having to use their 'special blend' of fuel when I drive through CA, yet i am subject to the laws of the state as well.

I support states rights. that means i support the right of the people of each state to govern themselves as they see fit. That also means that if I choose to visit a state, i agree to abide by the laws of that state.

I can always choose not to visit a state a do not live in. I have never been forced to visit California, or any other state.

Does that go for the Freedom Riders of the 1960s, or do you think students at the University of Mississippi helped organize the effort?

In this case, the brilliant, compassionate and liberty loving statesmen of Arizona are taking jurisdiction of the federal border. They want basically a "pass law" enacted after other repressive regimes have tried it and ultimately failed. But, they must be Conservatives. They simply don't learn from their own mistakes because they fail to learn history.

Taking jurisdiction from the INS.

Doesn't that make this case a national one by default?

It is a national problem, once they leave mexico and come through Az they go everywhere.
This law will be challenged in court, federal court. We all know and expect it. That will likely bring to light the fact this law addresses a federal responsibility that the federal government is not living up to. maybe it will force the federal government to act. That is the hope here anyway.

However; bringing in protesters from another state to try to influence a governor to sign or not sign a state bill into law is detrimental in a way that the protesters and the organizers of the out of state protesters probobly did not plan on.

It allows to governor to totally dismiss ALL the protesters as being from out of state. She doesn't have to worry about them at all, because they have no vote in the state.
Those that do live in the state, and are part of the protest then become as minimized as the out of state protesters. That was what i was pointing out.

I live in a very rural area of the state in a small town and have not met anyone that opposes the bill. Butthen last year we had one of our deputies killed by illegals. We are not guessing, they were caught, we know they were illegals and were smuggling drugs and people and were armed.

I agree with you on this. We saw with Prop H8 how outsiders can influence lawmaking in our own state.

Let AZ decide for themselves.
 
 
 
It seems that this law is not making people in Arizona happy.
 
So, since a couple of thousand in AZ is worth paying attention to. What about the hundreds of thousands that have turned out ACROSS A WHOLE COUNTRY? We can ignore those?

Look up the following word: hypocrite.
 
 
 
These people protesting are americans and have a right to protest.
 
no one said they couldn't, asshat.

These people protesting are americans and have a right to protest.

Let AZ decide for themselves.
 
For the record I stayed home and did not go to CA to protest when prop H8 was in play. In addition, I made the same type of statements about "home rule' and let the locals decide their own rules, in person and even on here.
I didn't have a different opinion then either.
 
 
The only problem is not only Arizonans will be subject to these laws, everyone who visits the state will be too.

Weak! If your trying to justify these protests by the commerce clause then you should thank the state assembly in AZ for enacting this law as the illegals influence interstate commerce as well.

Should the governor dismiss all protests out of hand because there are out of state people involved, the governor would be showing the short-sightedness endemic to Conservative governors. If Wallace dismissed all Civil Rights protests because not every marcher was from Alabama, he would be seeking shallow comfort and showing incredibly myopic leadership.

The Arizona law as proposed is basically Jim Crow for the Brown rather than the Black. All Americans should protest this bit of bigotry.

Does that go for the Freedom Riders of the 1960s, or do you think students at the University of Mississippi helped organize the effort?

In this case, the brilliant, compassionate and liberty loving statesmen of Arizona are taking jurisdiction of the federal border. They want basically a "pass law" enacted after other repressive regimes have tried it and ultimately failed. But, they must be Conservatives. They simply don't learn from their own mistakes because they fail to learn history.

Taking jurisdiction from the INS.

Doesn't that make this case a national one by default?
 
It is a national problem, once they leave mexico and come through Az they go everywhere.
This law will be challenged in court, federal court. We all know and expect it. That will likely bring to light the fact this law addresses a federal responsibility that the federal government is not living up to. maybe it will force the federal government to act. That is the hope here anyway.

However; bringing in protesters from another state to try to influence a governor to sign or not sign a state bill into law is detrimental in a way that the protesters and the organizers of the out of state protesters probobly did not plan on.

It allows to governor to totally dismiss ALL the protesters as being from out of state. She doesn't have to worry about them at all, because they have no vote in the state.
Those that do live in the state, and are part of the protest then become as minimized as the out of state protesters. That was what i was pointing out.

I live in a very rural area of the state in a small town and have not met anyone that opposes the bill. Butthen last year we had one of our deputies killed by illegals. We are not guessing, they were caught, we know they were illegals and were smuggling drugs and people and were armed.
 
Should the governor dismiss all protests out of hand because there are out of state people involved, the governor would be showing the short-sightedness endemic to Conservative governors. If Wallace dismissed all Civil Rights protests because not every marcher was from Alabama, he would be seeking shallow comfort and showing incredibly myopic leadership.

The Arizona law as proposed is basically Jim Crow for the Brown rather than the Black. All Americans should protest this bit of bigotry.
 
As always, I respect your opinion, yet I strongly disagree.

This law was created in response to the tremendous amount of crime in our state, capped off by the recent cold blooded murder of a popular rancher who's killers were traced to the border. Yet, none of the officials in mexico would do anything except admit that, yes, the killer fled south accross the border.

This state used to be mexico. There are a lot of hispanic people here. My wife for one, my grandkids for 3 more. My son in law came LEGALLY from Oaxaca. Most of us that live here have connections to hispanics.

Yes there are bigots, they exist everywhere. But this law was not "basically Jim Crow for the Brown rather than the Black". That is just the wrong assumption to make.

As far as the governor being a short-sighted conservative, I am not a fan of her. She became gov when dammit janet left to head up the DHS. We have an election in NOV.
I will say that the risk of all the protesters being minimized because of out of state protesters is real. That's all I was pointing out in previous posts. If she thinks that the protesters are not voters, and thatthe people that have been calling to support the bill are voters, who do you think she will listen to?

She is running for reelection this year.

Don't whine when others treat a protest you support with the same contempt that the left treat TEA Parties.
 
I got used to it during the 1960s. Conservatives then were far more dismissive of protests then than any Liberal is today.
 
 
 
 
How many of these protestors are not Arizonans?
 
A good chunk, many are Illegal Immigrants!
 
i don't know how many are not Arizonans. Since it was reported in the link given, there must be some. I would say again that 'importing' protesters from out of state in an attempt to influence a state governor could end up with all the protesters, rsidents or not, being minimized.

The article doesn't say so, but for the past week there has been a campaign accross the state to get people to call the governor and express support for the bill. My understanding is that it has been pretty successful. With the recent murder on the border, and the murders and kidnappings that have happened in just the past year, I would be surprised to find that the phone in campaign has not been successful.

This law is nothing more than the repressive "Pass Laws" of South Africa reborn in the Arizona desert. Under this law, any local Arizona cop can stop any Latino and ask for his papers. As you know, Latinos are the largest minority in the country. Many Latinos are here legally or are American citizens.

Enforcement of the immigration laws falls to federal authorities at the border and at the employer. Not to the local constabulary on the streets of Arizona.

This solution is Jim Crow for the Brown rather than the Black. You're not gaining liberty with these Gestapo tactics, you're erasing it.

Justice for the victims of crimes committed by illegal immigrants cannot be found by harassing everyone who looks Latino.

If it is that important to you I suggest a second home in Tucson. We let "partial year" residents vote in state elections. Everyone that owns property can register and vote in state elections as well. You too could have a vote in Arizona.

Tuscon is a lot nicer than Phoenix.

When you fly you have to comply with certain regulations. There is an implied contract. Show my ID at the airport? Fine. You are assuring our safety. The same goes for buying alcohol. Show my ID? Fine. I'm buying a regulated substance and I should have to prove my age.

Under this law, all you have to do is look Latino in order to get stopped and asked for papers. Are there any other circumstances when you can walk peacefully down a street and get stopped by a cop? Is this harassment? Absolutely! That's the definition of harassment.

Driving while Black. Looking Latino. Excuses for Conservatives to lean on minorities.

And then you must reap the whirlwind.

Ever wonder how that "Stop Snitchin"" attitude began? Cops harassing young Black folks simply for being Black. And now the levels of mistrust between the Black community and the law enforcement community have rendered both to ruin.

Try it with the nation's largest minority and in ten years time you will have a dysfunctional Latino community which mistrusts the police.

Why can't Conservatives learn from their own mistakes and the lessons of history?

 Arizona immigration bill: H.S. students leave school to join Capitol protest 
 
So 1000-2000 people out of the 5.1 million or so who live here protest, and "the people" aren't happy? Try "SOME people" aren't happy. I'd say most of us are pretty damned content.
 
 
 
Meddling?????

they are allowed to protest their treatment as travelers to Arizona.

You see if this passes anyone who visits Arizona will be subjecct to the fucked up law.
 
They're allowed to protest. They probably shouldn't flatter themselves that much of anyone here gives a rat's ass what they think, though. Californians are not highly thought-of by Arizonans as a rule, and many of us would be just as happy if they stayed in their own smucked-up state.

It's not making EVERYONE happy. No law does. On the other hand, there's no reason for those of us who like it to do anything but stay home and smile, since we already got what we wanted. So please don't sit there in whatever liberal pesthole you live in and presume to decide what Arizonans as a whole do and don't think based on a comparative handful of protestors, many of whom apparently don't even live here, simply because you like what they're saying.

Okay? So? I hadn't seen it.

Nor do I know who it is that is holding that sign.

Nor am I certain that is AT a tea party rally.

I suspect as you do, that the guy IS a tea party protester, but, that does not make it so.

I said weeks ago, that if the Tea Party wants to improve their image they have to edit: publicly denounce any such behavior including the use of the N-word to Congressmen.

I am not a tea party protester. I have never been to one of their events. I have no intention of attending one. I have only once heard a speech from a tea party rally and that was the other day when I clicked on a link here on site.

I commented then that I didn't like the rhetoric.

What do you want me to do or say? Do you want me to behave like the rest of the left wing and scream that everyone who attends a tea party rally is a racist? Ain't gonna happen as I have not been to one of their events.

from the link in post #6;
"Protesters swelled in front of the Capitol as people converged to rally against Senate Bill 1070 during the day. Some came from as far away as California.

The size of the crowd grew over the course of the afternoon, and estimates by Phoenix police and media varied between 1,500 and about 2,000. By about 5 p.m., most of the crowd had dispersed, but a new wave of about 50 to 100 protesters arrived from Carl Hayden Community High School.

During the day, some of the protesters marched around the building, chanting, "Si se puede," or "We can do it." They were joined by 56 members of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, who arrived by bus."

Does anyone besides me see a problem with people from another state meddling in a state's political process? I would think that the governor might simply dismiss the entire crowd thinking they are all from California and do not represent registered voters of the state.

As an aside, the only people that have been out in the little mountain town I live in are a few local residents that do vote here urging other registered Az voters to call the governor in support of the bill.
 
As they should. It's a great thing that Arizona is asserting itself, and it has every right to.

Napolitano is as clueless as ever. Just saw her interview on "gasp" Fox News.. "our borders are more secure now than they have ever been." sheesh..
 
 
 
 
from the link in post #6;
"Protesters swelled in front of the Capitol as people converged to rally against Senate Bill 1070 during the day. Some came from as far away as California.

The size of the crowd grew over the course of the afternoon, and estimates by Phoenix police and media varied between 1,500 and about 2,000. By about 5 p.m., most of the crowd had dispersed, but a new wave of about 50 to 100 protesters arrived from Carl Hayden Community High School.

During the day, some of the protesters marched around the building, chanting, "Si se puede," or "We can do it." They were joined by 56 members of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, who arrived by bus."

Does anyone besides me see a problem with people from another state meddling in a state's political process? I would think that the governor might simply dismiss the entire crowd thinking they are all from California and do not represent registered voters of the state.

As an aside, the only people that have been out in the little mountain town I live in are a few local residents that do vote here urging other registered Az voters to call the governor in support of the bill.
 
As they should. It's a great thing that Arizona is asserting itself, and it has every right to.

And that's a rather large lie. Arizona knows it and thus this new Law. Kudos to Arizona.

By the way, how do YOU know if they're Americans or not? Did YOU check their papers?

Funny, I don't recall seeing these protesters walking around with "I am an illegal immigrant" signs.
 
I don't recall seeing tea party protesters walking around with "I am a white supremacist" signs either.

I've seen a lot of signs posted on this site that allegedly come from Tea Party events but not one ounce of actual proof that those signs came from such an event or that the person holding them are actual Tea Party protesters.

Immie
 
Yeah, because there is nothing at all racist about the "Robbin for the Hood" and African witch doctor signs.
 
Every fucking time, we have the same stupid comments. One/two signs among tens of thousands and you single those out.

Are the left are suffering from the same learning disability?

This is where the hammer needs to be applied, Willow. The Obama administration should introduce a modified McCain bill on Monday that: secures the border tightly, begins reform to put the illegals on a path at the end of the citizenship line that is moving forward, and makes business accountable and discplined about who it hires for its work force.

I don't disagree. I'm not in favor of sending everyone home. I am in favor of them building a doggone fence and bringing all our troops home from Afghanistan and Iraq and putting them on the border. This is ridiculous. but don't put McCain's name on anything.. that asswipe has looked the other way for years.

OK...That issue...

March 18 2010...

 Texas senators urge Obama to beef up border security 

(Of course Rick perry did ask for it...but I see no real action on it other than)...

"Perry is seeking 1,000 National Guard troops and unmanned aircraft to help bolster border security in Texas."

And..."The Homeland Security Department currently operates predator drone aircraft along the southern and northern borders. The department is looking at placing a drone in Texas and basing it in Corpus Christi. "

____________________

I wouldn't blame Texas legislators if they adopted a law similiar to that of Arizona, and take matters into their own hands since the FED is lacking doing their job.

Of course we have Governor Perry's own website that addresses this issue...

OK, we are in basic agreement. But let's get it introduced as a GOP bill if Obama is going to drag feet. In fact, that is a superb idea.

Yea, let's pull the troops out BEFORE we finish the job.... again.... cuz that worked real well last time didn't it? oh wait.... no, we had to go back to Iraq. Simplistic answers are never simple. And, since my family are directly affected, I'd quite like for them not to have to go back.

How dare President Obama persecute businesses would be the beginning, then they would complain he was interfering with trade with Mexico and who knows where that would lead.

Does that go for the Freedom Riders of the 1960s, or do you think students at the University of Mississippi helped organize the effort?

In this case, the brilliant, compassionate and liberty loving statesmen of Arizona are taking jurisdiction of the federal border. They want basically a "pass law" enacted after other repressive regimes have tried it and ultimately failed. But, they must be Conservatives. They simply don't learn from their own mistakes because they fail to learn history.

Taking jurisdiction from the INS.

Doesn't that make this case a national one by default?
 
It is a national problem, once they leave mexico and come through Az they go everywhere.
This law will be challenged in court, federal court. We all know and expect it. That will likely bring to light the fact this law addresses a federal responsibility that the federal government is not living up to. maybe it will force the federal government to act. That is the hope here anyway.

However; bringing in protesters from another state to try to influence a governor to sign or not sign a state bill into law is detrimental in a way that the protesters and the organizers of the out of state protesters probobly did not plan on.

It allows to governor to totally dismiss ALL the protesters as being from out of state. She doesn't have to worry about them at all, because they have no vote in the state.
Those that do live in the state, and are part of the protest then become as minimized as the out of state protesters. That was what i was pointing out.

I live in a very rural area of the state in a small town and have not met anyone that opposes the bill. Butthen last year we had one of our deputies killed by illegals. We are not guessing, they were caught, we know they were illegals and were smuggling drugs and people and were armed.
 
Should the governor dismiss all protests out of hand because there are out of state people involved, the governor would be showing the short-sightedness endemic to Conservative governors. If Wallace dismissed all Civil Rights protests because not every marcher was from Alabama, he would be seeking shallow comfort and showing incredibly myopic leadership.

The Arizona law as proposed is basically Jim Crow for the Brown rather than the Black. All Americans should protest this bit of bigotry.
 
Easy for you to get on your high leftist horse and make lofty pronouncements about Jim Crow from your position just about as frigging far from the tidal wave of illegal immigrants as you can possibly get. From my position one hour from the Mexican border, may I cordially invite you to bite me? It's not YOUR city with an astronomically high crime rate, YOUR police force being overwhelmed, YOUR hospitals being run out of business, YOUR school districts being crippled, and YOUR taxes being affected, now is it?

Meanwhile, perhaps you could spare us the conveniently vague moral posturing and be just a hair more specific about how this constitutes "Jim Crow for the Brown" (and isn't THAT a rather racist-sounding designation?). I know I'm waiting with baited breath for your wisdom on this, oh Armchair Border Warrior.
 
 
 
 
 
this law is nothing more than the repressive "pass laws" of south africa reborn in the arizona desert. Under this law, any local arizona cop can stop any latino and ask for his papers. As you know, latinos are the largest minority in the country. Many latinos are here legally or are american citizens. then they should appreciate what is being done for them. I'm an american and i have to show my papers, and my feet, and my whole body is scanned when the authorities deem it necessary and before you give me "it saves lives" bs i dare you to tell me how many americans die at the hands of illegals vs how many die on a plane because of terrorists..

enforcement of the immigration laws falls to federal authorities at the border and at the employer. how is the federal government doing in your opinion??? not to the local constabulary on the streets of arizona.

This solution is jim crow for the brown rather than the black. You're not gaining liberty with these gestapo tactics, you're erasing it. how is proving you have a right to be in the country gestapo.. Name one country who doesn't enforce immigration laws.

justice for the victims of crimes committed by illegal immigrants cannot be found by harassing everyone who looks latino.
 
how is proving citizenship harassment? I have to show my papers and my feet and my whole body when boarding an airplane. If i fly to france or canada or mexico i must have papers to prove citizenship do i not/ so cry us a fucking river.
 
When you fly you have to comply with certain regulations. There is an implied contract. Show my ID at the airport? Fine. You are assuring our safety. The same goes for buying alcohol. Show my ID? Fine. I'm buying a regulated substance and I should have to prove my age.

Under this law, all you have to do is look Latino in order to get stopped and asked for papers. Are there any other circumstances when you can walk peacefully down a street and get stopped by a cop? Is this harassment? Absolutely! That's the definition of harassment.

Driving while Black. Looking Latino. Excuses for Conservatives to lean on minorities.

And then you must reap the whirlwind.

Ever wonder how that "Stop Snitchin"" attitude began? Cops harassing young Black folks simply for being Black. And now the levels of mistrust between the Black community and the law enforcement community have rendered both to ruin.

Try it with the nation's largest minority and in ten years time you will have a dysfunctional Latino community which mistrusts the police.

Why can't Conservatives learn from their own mistakes and the lessons of history?
 
Why can't leftists learn to stop lying?

Either show me the exact place in this law that calls for the police to stop people for "looking Latino" or shut the smuck up with your disingenuous fear-mongering.

My understanding of Brewer is that she's fairly moderate. At least conservatives don't seem to like her much. Her political career hasn't been doing so great as it is anyway. Not sure if this will matter or not.
 
 
Anybody see any bottle throwing going on at the Tea-party rallies?

Did anyone see any violence like we witnessed today in Arizona from these people?

All of the nastiness the Tea-party was accused of and then some was on display by the left and Illegal Immigration supporters....and that lousy fuck Obama was on their side.

Anyone catch what he had to say about the new law? It was fucken disgraceful.

I think it has solidified her own political position well in Arizona, and she certainly provides a politically attractive alternative to Mad Michelle and Sad Sarah.

The downside is that the law will drive the largest ethnic minority in America, excluding females, completely into the Democratic camps.

That argument would be a lot more credible if it was a one-shot occurrence. Noting there are hundreds of similar signs, one of two things are true:
1. The number of opponents showing up at the rallies to make them look stupid is larger than the movement itself.
2. The tea party is filled with idiots.

Option two is the far more likely occurrence.

this law opens up for racist, civil rights violtions etc... this law is as fucked up as it can be but only in the south would this happen. and other state have all the right to say something like this.

cause it will effect there state. there so much wrong with this. how do you find someone illegal immgration? color of skin=yes = stop= racist. = voiton of civil rights

Story (0) Comments Posted: Friday, April 23, 2010 11:02 pm | Comments

 Bars governments and agencies from limiting or restricting their employees from enforcing immigration laws "to less than the full extent permitted by federal law."

 Requires police, where there is "reasonable suspicion" the person is an illegal immigrant, to make a "reasonable attempt... when practicable" to determine that person's legal status.

 Contains an exception if pursuing that inquiry "may hinder or obstruct an investigation."

 Prohibits race, color or national origin from being the sole factor used in determining whether to pursue investigating someone's immigration status.

 Says governments cannot prohibit their employees from sending, receiving or maintaining information about someone's immigration status to determine whether they are eligible for public benefits or services.

 Permits any legal resident to sue if a government agency adopts any policy or practice that restricts the ability of its workers to enforce immigration laws, with judges required to impose penalties of up to $5,000 a day.

Wasted money on your education I see.

obie wan messiah said much the same thing.. poor illegals will be mistweated.. boo hoooo,, nary a word for the legal citizens of Arizona. Nary a word.
 
 
 
 
Anybody see any bottle throwing going on at the Tea-party rallies?

Did anyone see any violence like we witnessed today in Arizona from these people?

All of the nastiness the Tea-party was accused of and then some was on display by the left and Illegal Immigration supporters....and that lousy fuck Obama was on their side.

Anyone catch what he had to say about the new law? It was fucken disgraceful.
 
BHO was correct, irresponsible non-action at the federal level leads to worse action at the state level. Absolutely correct, whistle.
 
I'm sure Mud will be thrilled with your "A" for him. Maybe he'll bring you an apple.

Damn, you are an ass. Every post of yours reminds me what is wrong with the GOP.

Explain to me how it's okay to break the law?

Why does Obama seem to support breaking the law?

After all being critical of anyone who dares to enforce the law is encouraging law-breaking.

In what way does fairness equate to entering this country illegally?
 
 
I'm not an illegal so I have nothing to fear in Arizona.

Oh except the drug cartels that this law is meant to diminish.

Obama, of course, does not get a pass and the Congress does not get a pass, anymore than the Bush era gets a pass.

Breaking the law is governed by federal law in this issue, not state.

To suggest Obama condones breaking the law is shallow and insipid thinking.

I hope you would have been critical of the Germans who enforced illegal and immoral police codes in Hitler's Germany.

The issue of "fairness" about illegal immigration is not the issue: what is the issue is that the federal legislature has to act and act now.

Good. I hope they swept the protest for illegals, arrested and deported. Simplifies the whole damn process.

 Arizona immigration bill: H.S. students leave school to join Capitol protest 

The size of the crowd grew over the course of the afternoon, and estimates by Phoenix police and media varied between 1,500 and about 2,000. By about 5 p.m., most of the crowd had dispersed, but a new wave of about 50 to 100 protesters arrived from Carl Hayden Community High School
.

During the day, some of the protesters marched around the building, chanting, "Si se puede," or "We can do it." They were joined by 56 members of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, who arrived by bus................

Apparently some La Raza terrorists, illegals and their communist enablers are displeased......BUT the AMERICAN People of Arizona are quite happy that their Governement is fighting the invasion.
 
 
When students left classes to protest in the 2006 'marcha' in CA, the parents were told they would be charged by the school for it for any ADA lost. Next day, most all students returned to class.
 
 
 
The people are not happy in Arizona.
 
Care to revise that statement?

 Bars governments and agencies from limiting or restricting their employees from enforcing immigration laws "to less than the full extent permitted by federal law."

 Requires police, where there is "reasonable suspicion" the person is an illegal immigrant, to make a "reasonable attempt... when practicable" to determine that person's legal status.

 Contains an exception if pursuing that inquiry "may hinder or obstruct an investigation."

 Prohibits race, color or national origin from being the sole factor used in determining whether to pursue investigating someone's immigration status.

 Says governments cannot prohibit their employees from sending, receiving or maintaining information about someone's immigration status to determine whether they are eligible for public benefits or services.

 Permits any legal resident to sue if a government agency adopts any policy or practice that restricts the ability of its workers to enforce immigration laws, with judges required to impose penalties of up to $5,000 a day.

 Makes it a violation of state law to be in this country illegally, linking it to the failure to have the requisite "alien registration document."

The law says it prohibits using race, but you'd have to be a fool to believe that's actually going to occur.
 
 
Dood. There are plenty of laws on the books already. If a cop is going to harass someone based on race, he doesn't need this law as a pretext.
 
 
 
What does this law allow law enforcement to do that they couldn't do before under existing law?

Specifically.
 
One most notable is the requirement to carry proof of citizenship.

Can't have that going on....according to Obama.

Reminds me of the voter registration ID that was proposed.

Can't have one with an actual picture of the voter on it. How the heck are they going to vote multiple times or in more then one district if they keep better control of exactly where folks are voting.
 
 
 
What does this law allow law enforcement to do that they couldn't do before under existing law?

Specifically law enforcement officers in this state are 'state certified' officers. State certified officers are given the jurisdiction of enforcing state laws. In order to enforce federal laws, such as even asking about citizenship staus, law enforcement officers needed to have 'federal certification'. They needed federal law enforcement certification simply to ask if the person they pulled over for a speeding violation. The dual certifications were held by relativley few officers.
With the new law, officers possessing a state certification are now allowed to ask about citizenship status. If it is found that they are illegal, they still have to be turned over to ICE, just like always. The law specifically says that people can't be stopped simply to check their status.
Now as far as some of the people that claim the police here will use this law to harrass latinos, please consider;
We have a lot of Latinos in the state, some are even police officers. Our county sherrif is a Navajo man.
I have lived here most of my life. You have to be doing something stupid even to get pulled over in a car. the police behave like that old dylan song and they just don't need you.
I have visited eastern states, especially NY, MA and PA. The police there are miserable.A close 4th is CA. I remember driving across I86 in Ny and seeing a cop every 10 miles or so just waiting for someone to go 56mph. The cops here dont do that, at least I never saw it.
The police here are actually about safety, and not there just to collect revenue for the state.
 
 
I also must comment that while watching the phoenix news last nite, I saw a guy with a tshirt that said 'tea party racist' on it getting dragged away by the cops for throwing something at one of them. The news says there were several arrests.
WTF?
How is that justified? What purpose does it serve?
 
 
 
The law specifically says that people can't be stopped simply to check their status.
 
If that was the case, why would immigrants need to have their papers on them at all times to produce on demand?

Are you asking why would someone be arrested for assualting a police officer?

nope, why was it not a peaceful protest?

and

In case you didn't know, immigrants have been required to carry their papers for a long time. Just like you need your passport in Mexico or france.

It is not required to carry ID for citizens, but I would advise it. Here's why;
I have been involved with search and rescue several times and have found a couple of bodies that had no id. I also know of a family that had a man in his 20's go missing. They don't know what happened to him, he left his id home.
 
 
 
 
 
I don't need to suspect it. It's a picture from their protest last fall.
 
And you jump to the conclusion, that the person who is holding that sign is actually a protester who agrees with the tea party.

I suspect he is, but that does not make it so... politics cause people to do dishonest things including showing up at events of the opponent and making them look like imbeciles and/or racists.

Immie
 
That argument would be a lot more credible if it was a one-shot occurrence. Noting there are hundreds of similar signs, one of two things are true:
1. The number of opponents showing up at the rallies to make them look stupid is larger than the movement itself.
2. The tea party is filled with idiots.

Option two is the far more likely occurrence.
 
Damn, we agree on something three times in one week!

I'm not saying that some of the tea party protesters are not racist. I'm also not saying that those signs do not belong to them.

What I am saying is that until I have proof that they do, I am going to hold open the thought that there is a possibility that some of those signs are being held by people that simply want to make tea party protesters look like frigging racists and idiots. Which ones those signs are, if any are, I have no idea, but I don't put it past the left wing to try such a maneuver. Before you ask, neither would I put it past some right wingers either.

Immie
 
 
 
So how do the people against "big gubmint" square that belief with their support for the Papers Please law?
 
If you were asking me... I didn't know that I supported the "Papers Please" law.  

In fact, from the little bit I have read here about it, I don't support it.

These people protesting are americans and have a right to protest.
 
oh they are?.....all of them?......more "Truth" from "TRUTHMATTERS"....geezus you are clueless....
 
this is land is our land this land is your land whatever happen to that? we share lands we love when people come here.

there abosultying fuck up law here.
 
just because you are "here"....does not mean you are an American....and Woody Guthrie wrote that song in reference to AMERICANS.....he was tired of hearing Kate Smith sing "God Bless America"....so he wrote his own America song which he originally called..."God Blessed America for Me".....

sure it will....but when you live among countless illegals for a period of time.... you usually can get pretty accurate in knowing who is and who isnt....ESPECIALLY if you talk to them....dead giveaway....

"Countless"? The illegals compose about 3% of our population. When "you talk to them"?

Have you lived in rural Mississippi? They sound like the early 18th century. Have you listed to Sarah? She sounds like a descendent of a Scandanavian immigrant from the midwest who was repatriated to Alaska farmlng valleys during and after the Great Depression.

You sound, simply, silly.

These people protesting are americans and have a right to protest.
 
How do you know? Did someone checked their papers?

In order to enforce the law, you must be able to identify who's breaking the law. Feds were not doing it. Someone has.

Since AZ has no jurisdiction to do it under federal laws, they exercised their right to set up a state law and do what feds are not doing under federal law.

Americano is known to use faulty logic often and awfully.

Extend his logic: Individual A commits what Americano considers to be an intentional murder of one of Americano's friends, and said accused murderer is found innocent. Thus, Americano, knowing the accused is guilty, executes him.

You cannot assume the duties of the state. Arizona cannot illegally take upon itself the duties of the federal government. Thus a federal court will slap this down before the end of the week.

Outstanding rebuttal, Americano. Your logic remains awful.
 
 
Your example would be OK if reassemble anything I am talking about.

The law says it prohibits using race, but you'd have to be a fool to believe that's actually going to occur.
 
You'd have to be a fool living in a nearly all-white state to think it would. Do you KNOW how many citizens of Mexican heritage live in this state? There aren't enough hours in the day for the cops to card every Hispanic in Arizona just because. They'd about HAVE to have some other process of elimination at work.

Besides, as much as this might shock you, Arizonans actually allow the "little brown brothers" to join the police force. Think they're likely to do a lot of racial profiling against others of the same ethnicity?
 
 
 
Dood. There are plenty of laws on the books already. If a cop is going to harass someone based on race, he doesn't need this law as a pretext.
 
I'd love to know where people got the idea that all the cops in Arizona are white.

I don't know anyone in Arizona over a certain age who leaves the house without ID, anyway. Our public transportation SUCKS, and our cities are very spread out, which means most people over 16 drive everywhere... which means you're carrying a driver's license. I would think most adults carry ID, anyway, for purposes of purchasing with checks or credits cards, buying restricted items, all manner of reasons. And if you have a green card, I think you're supposed to carry it with you.
 
 
 
 
The only problem is not only Arizonans will be subject to these laws, everyone who visits the state will be too.
 
And what's exactly wrong with that?
 
Why the holy hell would one be wandering around a strange state with no ID, anyway? How do you go on vacation without driving a car at any point in time?
 
 
 
 
 
Same as the health care bill I suppose
 
Apples and oranges, herring and smelt, goats and sheep... you get it, whistle.

T he health care bill, just like Medicaid and Medicadre and Social Security, are all legal under the Constitution. Just as immigration policy and control is federal, not state, business.

A federal court will place the AZ law under injuction by the end of the coming week.
 
Nope.....apples and oranges. Medicare, Social Security, and forced health care insurance are totally different.

Don't hold your breath on the injunction by the way. How does it feel to have the shoe on the other foot? For once Republicans are the first to make a move instead of a bunch of sneaky fucken Democrats.
 
You brought up health care, whistle, and I competently answered your non sequitur. Nope, the injunction will be in place by Thursday. Watch and see.
 
 
If so Arizona should enforce its Laws anyway. Piss on the Feds.

And we'll see what effect...if any...it has on Arizona's rights.

What really seems to burn your ass is somebody dared to do something about a growing problem.

Obama and the Dems ignored all of the murders and all of the money being lost. So they decided after yet another rancher was killed in cold blood that it was time to do something. Something I'm sure Obama would have done himself had that rancher had been...dare I say... Black. Never let an opportunity to patronize a large voting block pass by they always say.

In the words of Obama...why can't we use a "Novel Idea" and require Visas....like they used to in Europe. That would solve the problem or at least make it harder for illegals to roam the country.

NOPE..I'm sure you would scream bloody murder if we started doing something that resembled Europe. But that is essentially what we're talking about here. Right?

They're using the health care bill to computorize all of our health records.....why not have everyone apply for Visas and when a cop stops someone or a border guard checks IDs at state border crossings all they have to do is swipe the card and it tells the officer exactly where that person has been. Obama wants to check up on us....we should be able to check up on illegals or anyone traveling the country. Obama wants to monitor our bank accounts now so we should be able to monitor folks that are roaming the country.

The hypocrisy of you people is simply amazing.
 
 
 
Explain to ME why he is utterly unembarrassed - as any rational person would be - that states are being forced to pass laws to do the job HE should be doing and isn't.
 
I'd agree with you except that I have to say he has only been in office for about 15 months it isn't like this problem has only been a problem under his watch and the solution is not something that will come about as quickly as say the total salvation (I'm puking while typing that) of our Health Care System. He's not to blame for the current situation. Yes, I think he should be working on a solution, but I don't think he is to blame for it.

Yup. That old worn out excuse is not really flying anymore.

The Immigration issue was a problem long before Obama and the Dems decided to rig health care to suit them. Doing something rather then nothing would be better then what they've chose to do. The problem is simple yet becomes complicated because Democrats are so afraid of pissing off Hispanics.

True. It's not like he just woke up last week and discovered that we have porous borders, murders by drug-runners, and money is being lost left and right due the flood of illegals into this country.

Nope.....the illegal immigration problem serves them well so they are less inclined to deal with it then say.....going after "Fat-Cat" bankers.

I agree, but I don't think he should be embarrassed by the fact that the borders are porous. He didn't cause the problem. The fact that you and others believe that it should be priority #1 (something that I am not convinced of, but then I don't live in Arizona either and have not suffered the crime issue that they have mentioned) does not mean that I think it should be. I think the National Debt is much more important than hunting down poor immigrant workers who come to this country illegally. I think the tax structure of this country is more important than the hunting down of illegals as well, and corruption in Washington, Abortion, the wars in the Middle East, yes, even the health care crisis although I don't agree with the solution he and his cohorts came up with.

Illegal immigration is not my top priority in this country today. Partly because I believe "we" as citizens of the U.S.A. encourage and want those illegals here. I don't believe they would be here if we didn't pay them to come here, and I use the term pay quite loosely.

National Debt is simple....quit spending so much. What did they do? Spend even more. How's that for their solution?

The illegal immigrant problem is ruining our health care industry. So what do the Dems do? They take it over.

They like things the way they are. Face it.
 
 
So now democrats are the conservatives huh?

what a huge lack of logic.

Obama is provinding the change he promised and you call it staying the same?

The republicans left a huge mess and now you complain about spending to clean up they mess they made.

Seems you have a way of seeing everything ass-backwards.

When it came to illegals Democrats were the party of no. That's why the problem persists.
 
 
So what the fuck are you trying to blame the democrats for now, You didnt make it very clear.

whistle's ability to express herself clearly is diminishing.

Every poster here has said that the feds have to do something. Obama has said the feds have to act.

Those who understand constitutional American government know that AZ has acted unconstitutionally and will be slapped back into place.

Accountability for this problem is that of Congress, and each of us should base our votes this fall on what our national legislators have done or failed to do about immigration reform and border security.

I don't see that "not to blame" applies here. It's his job NOW, and if he managed to ram healthcare down our throats in 15 months, he certainly had enough time to at least PROPOSE something to help the illegal immigration problem. But oh no, enforcing our borders wasn't the priority taking over the healthcare system was, was it? As the current office holder and representative of the federal government, he should be ashamed, not superciliously criticizing Arizona for deciding to protect itself when he won't. Oh, and let us not forget that while he couldn't be bothered to address the problem of illegal immigration, he's certainly RIGHT on the spot to address the problem of obstructing Arizona's attempt to do his job for him.
 
 
Cecilie1200 is correct, of course, that something needs to be done. Now that health care reform is fact and that BHO can kick the opposition in the nuts with impunity, I suggest he move forward on immigration. Force the Republican Party to either work for him or be weak on this issue going into the fall elections. Now is the time to get this done!

I agree with almost everything you say.

The one area I disagree with is in the part that he should be embarrassed about the issue. He didn't cause the problem. Sure, he should have at least started to work on solving it... by the way, I don't expect him to actually do anything about it during his term as President even if he is here for two terms.

I'm very unhappy with the outcome of Health Care Reform. He has screwed America over and I don't believe he is finished screwing us about it yet.

Don't expect him to work on a solution to illegal immigration unless it is in reference to giving amnesty and voting privileges to illegal immigrants.

The protesters are just a bunch of idiots though, right?
 
Not only that they are seditious, security threat, linked to extremist groups, probably instigated a recent terrorist acts, and just plain racist because they happen to be composed of one single ethnic group.

We should definately do a raid on one of their compounds in order to show how tough the government is in putting these people down.

You are very foolish if you think otherwise. The Dems now know the GOP will not work with them. Therefore, the Dem congress now will beat the Republican minority down: immigration, foreign policy, cap and trade, etc. The Republicans had their chance and blew it.

BHO walks the walk, talks the talk, and stalks the stalk. I have no doubt that the GOP is going to regret its position for the first sixteen months on this administration. Bunch of idiots.

But then I have been around the border since I was a kid.
 
 
 
I saw them. the kids are pissed. I can wait to see a republican try to say the hispanics like republicans. I cant wait until 2012.

Here is a hint righty's. You will not win an election with one demographic.....white males. You will lose again, probably just as bad as the last time.

There is something I have not seen mentioned about the border problem, and citizens.

Here in Arizona, the governor called for the minutemen to come back and help on the border. In the town where i live, there are several members of that group and the citizens militia. Since that high profile murder on the border a few weeks ago, the talk among them has not been sounding real humanitarian.
I work a couple nights a week at a small bar in the back of a restaurant in town, so I hear things.
The talk was a little calmer last night after word of the new law made the rounds. Last week I heard several of the local 'cowboys', hispanic americans included among them, actually talk about what guns and what quads to take to the border with them. There is one guy around here that is a little scarier than the rest anyway, who is talking about how easy it is to kill illegals and not get caught.

I believe that if the government at the federal level doesn't do something soon, there will be more dead mexicans in the desert than normal.

You sound, simply, silly.
 
there is upwards of 5 million in my area of the Globe Jake.....my neighborhood is about 60% illegal and semi-Illegals....and i know this because i have lived here since 83....and the Mexicans associated with me and my wife have said as much...they live here too.....and yea Jake when you talk to one you can usually tell...." he ain't from these parts".....and S.Cal. and Arizona ain't "Rural Mississippi" Jake....hate to break that to ya........what sounds silly is you....have you ever met a real live Mexican from Mexico Jake?.....the way your responding i take it you haven't met many.....and who the hell is Sarah?......

how do you figure out who is legal or not illegal? how... people born in usa are part of and part of usa. your another moron in this world we need... like we need more racist assholes in this land.

We already have a law here called e-verify, yet this state wont enforce it. Why not?
 
 
Arizona has an estimated 460,000 illegal immigrants, and its harsh, remote desert serves as the corridor for the majority of illegal immigrants and drugs moving north into the U.S. from Mexico.

How many Americans want this to continue?

yup.
The new law in AZ does increase penalties and fines for hiring illegals. It remains to be seen if the state will actually enforce it. I hope they do. The reason that they might have to is that it is also in the new law that any law enforcement agency can now enforce it, and because there is a provision in the bill that allows municipalities and citizens recourse if they observe that the law is not being enforced.

let's take my town for example. There is a house in town that is a safe house, it's easy to observe, and everyone in town knows it. Several times in the past citizens have reported this to the town cops, who had no jurisdiction, so they called DPS, who also said they have no jurisdiction,, who then called ICE, who TWO DIFFERENT TIMES NOW said "Yes, they are illegal,but they are breaking any laws, we have no reason to arrest them."( I know, we all said the same thing, illegals are already breaking the law)

With this new law, I, or the town can now file a complaint against the police for not enforcing the law.

I think having actual citizen involvement and giving municipalities a tool to force the law to be enforced will result in more enforcement.

I still say the best thing about the new law in Az is the fact that illegal immigration is getting national attention because of it.

As I said before, if the federal government doesn't live up to it's responsibility soon, I think we are going to see a tragic increase in the number of dead (murdered) mexicans in our southern deserts.
 
 
While they have such a large group of folks there in Arizona protesting, they should begin to check their credentials and go ahead and bus the illegal aliens there back to Mexico. Look at all the money they could save on the round up!

One of our state reps was on the radio station today saying that the illegals are afraid to go and protest, and insisted that several that are protesting are the illegal's "anchor babies".

Personally, i don't know.

Just have them do the "ICE" Test. This involves sending an individual into the mist of the crowd and yell out "ICE". Those that turn and run are most likely illegal aliens.
 
 
This kind of action should have been in effect years ago, now we need to take it one step further, any politician not supporting this should be convicted of treason.

ICE? Is that I. C. E. or is it ICE? I'm not an illegal nor border patrol. I'm not picking up the allusion here.

Clue me in please, but when you do, I am certain, I will feel stupid for not having recognized it right away.

Anyone who gives speeches at their protest should be charged with inciting violence and charged with sedition.

That includes that fat-fuck Al Sharpton.

you guys are fucking morons. how do you know who is illegal? tell me.... it does not say in the bill. the only way its SKIN COLOR. so stop being fucking dicks and look at the facts.

second without illegal allines where would this country be? excatly now go shut up.

this land is for everyone. this is the american dream. stop being hogs and share the land. we were not the first on this land and we won't be the last.

you really want to know who owns this land was native Americans which we stole it from them.

so accodring to you all everyone should be shiped out. cause we are all illegal
 
 
 
 
really how is that? how are they illegal base of color of skin? how tell me.... tell think you so smart.

how do you figure out who is legal or not illegal? how... people born in usa are part of and part of usa. your another moron in this world we need... like we need more racist assholes in this land.

color of skin is not the reason someone illegal. nice try. a better question is who would pass a moron like you.

all states should follow suit, if people don't like it they should go back to their own country.

 New immigration law fuels protests in Arizona Naples Daily News 
 
are you this dense? just cause someone does not like the bill does not make them illegal. there millions of diffent color skin who are and were born in America and you telling to leave?

why you hating people base off the law who disagree which is racial profiling end of story.
 
 
 
 
 
Explain to ME why he is utterly unembarrassed - as any rational person would be - that states are being forced to pass laws to do the job HE should be doing and isn't.
 
I'd agree with you except that I have to say he has only been in office for about 15 months it isn't like this problem has only been a problem under his watch and the solution is not something that will come about as quickly as say the total salvation (I'm puking while typing that) of our Health Care System. He's not to blame for the current situation. Yes, I think he should be working on a solution, but I don't think he is to blame for it.

Immie
 
Yup. That old worn out excuse is not really flying anymore.

The Immigration issue was a problem long before Obama and the Dems decided to rig health care to suit them. Doing something rather then nothing would be better then what they've chose to do. The problem is simple yet becomes complicated because Democrats are so afraid of pissing off Hispanics.

True. It's not like he just woke up last week and discovered that we have porous borders, murders by drug-runners, and money is being lost left and right due the flood of illegals into this country.

Nope.....the illegal immigration problem serves them well so they are less inclined to deal with it then say.....going after "Fat-Cat" bankers.
 
just another moron gop who wants the contury to go to hell... to make a point. as a persident you have more than one thing. and it took bush more than 7+ years just to add a damn wall which does not work.

The law is not unconstitutional. The asking for identification is a secondary enforcement after there is a legal reason to stop someone.

For example, if a guy runs a red light he will be stopped and asked for a license. No license he gets arrested if he then can't prove his citizenship or legal status, his ass gets deported.

Simple, effective, just.

You must have your drivers license on your person if you wish to drive a car. It's not enforced worth a damn, but it is a crime. I believe you are also required to produce ID if requested by an officer of the law... so I guess yes, you must carry ID.
 
 
No, there is no requirement to carry ID, only licenses for particular privileges, such as driving a vehicle. I can't believe other moderates and conservatives aren't screaming about this, BUT this will undermine any legitiamte argument from the far right that a national ID is somehow wrong. The right has forever given its approval to a national ID.

your right Jake....this question was asked to a Criminal defence attorney in an on-line legal advice forum....he answered thus....

A person CANNOT be arrested just for failing to identify himself or failing to have ID, even with a lawful detention. It is NOT interfering with an officer. The only effect of not having ID occurs if a police officer has probable cause to believe an arrestee has committed a criminal offense. A police officer who could otherwise give an arrestee a citation to appear would instead take the person into custody to appear before a magistrate. But this is ONLY if the officer has probable cause to believe the person has committed a crime--NOT just because the person did not have ID.

Of course, one must have identification in his or her possession when driving, and a police officer obviously can demand to see a drivers license from any driver lawfully detained.

"If you [are stopped by police] one too many times it's very burdensome. It's the sort of thing like if you are followed in a store because of the way you look," Hernandez said.

Okay, so two people walk into your store. One is a white guy in nice shorts and a polo shirt, with a nice haircut. The other is black wearing a jacket with lots of pockets...which one are YOU going to keep your eye on, and why is that or isn't it racist?

Yeah, getting stopped by the police is burdensome. It was a burden for me to have to go to court with my proof of insurance when I was caught with out it, but I did it. Big deal. There are laws, I object to cops just walking up to a person on the street and demanding ID, but I have no problems with them arresting someone when they were speeding and didn't have prof they were here legally.
 
 
Still waiting on an answer as to why people think that an Hispanic soldier with relatives here illegally deserves more rights than my brother and his mother in law......I'm beginning to think that Hispanics actually have MORE rights in this country be they legal or illegal, than the rest of us. This just isn't right.

If I go to Arizona, I will be sure to bring my citizenship papers. When states give licenses to illegal immigrants and they steal social security numbers from Americans, a driver's license isn't enough proof anymore, is it?

Heck, do you have any idea what I had to go through to get my son an id in this state, and we allow illegals to get driver's licenses. His birth certificate and ss# weren't enough. Nor was his name on our insurance card, our ids, etc. We had to show his picture id from school, his medicaid card AND his special needs bus pass with his picture on it and even then they didn't want to give him an id, until the manager told the clerk to. Apparently they were mad at me for asking what I'd have to provide if he were illegal.

If we didn't allow illegals to get driver's licenses, I'll bet his birth certificate, social security number and the word of his parents would have been enough. It was sure enough when I got my driver's license, before we became a sanctuary state.
 
 
 
this law opens up for racist, civil rights violtions etc... this law is as fucked up as it can be but only in the south would this happen. and other state have all the right to say something like this.

cause it will effect there state. there so much wrong with this. how do you find someone illegal immgration? color of skin=yes = stop= racist. = voiton of civil rights
 
Well, maybe in New Hampshire, you folks are racist enough to believe anyone you see with a different skin color is a possible illegal. Here in Arizona, somewhere around half of our population is non-white, and fully 30%+ are Hispanic, so we don't consider that particularly suspicious. To us, suspicious behavior is having ten people living in a two-room house, or trying to get a cab in the middle of nowhere with all your worldly possessions on you, stuff like that.

Perhaps you ought to try getting out of your provincial little bubble once in a while and see how the rest of the world lives before you start projecting onto us.
 
 
 
 
The law specifically says that people can't be stopped simply to check their status.
 
If that was the case, why would immigrants need to have their papers on them at all times to produce on demand?
 
Because INS did have the right to check up on people's immigration status, and the immigrants had to be prepared to pony up if INS asked.

I'm not sure about "required" if asked by an officer, but if they're asking, there's a reason, so you stand a good chance of being detained until you can prove who you are.

For example: a friend of my husband's was walking down the street near his house, not doing anything in particular. The cops stopped him and asked who he was as part of a canvas for a suspect in a crime in that area who met the same basic description Joe's friend did. Had he not had his ID on him, they would - quite reasonably - have detained him until he could prove his identity, on the possibility that he was the suspected criminal they were searching for.

Moral of the story: it's always a good idea to leave the house with ID. You never know what's going to happen.
