Two things were certain about the Indiana Pacers' signing of
former Denver Nuggets guard Dahntay Jones on Thursday.

First, the Pacers really wanted the defensive stalwart, who was
an unrestricted free agent.

Second, Jones didn't necessarily want to leave the Mile High
City.

"We were talking pretty much since Day One of free agency,"
Jones' agent, Mark Bartelstein, said of the Pacers. "They were
very interested. They had a role that they thought he could really
add to their team, so it was a lot of interest. (Pacers general
manager) David Morway and (president of basketball operations)
Larry Bird put a lot of time and energy into recruiting Dahntay,
and ultimately he made a decision that this is the best fit for
him."

The result was a four-year contract worth $11 million for Jones
to reprise his hard-nosed defensive role in Indiana. The Nuggets
now officially have an opening at the starting shooting guard slot,
which will almost certainly be filled by J.R. Smith.

"I think ideally he would have loved to have stayed in Denver
and continued building on what the team did last year,"
Bartelstein said. "But, for financial (reasons), it just didn't
make sense. And it's a little bittersweet. He would have loved to
have stayed with the Nuggets.

"The fans were great to him; he really enjoyed playing for
George Karl and with his teammates. But, you know, it's also a
business. The Pacers present a great opportunity for him, a big
role on their team. After weighing everything, he thought it was
the right decision to make."

Meanwhile, there is no shortage of teams interested in
restricted free-agent forward Linas Kleiza's services, yet
unrestricted free-agent guard Anthony Carter's options appear more
limited. The Nuggets can match any offer for Kleiza, and that might
scare away some teams. The Nuggets also have interest in Portland
forward Channing Frye, but Phoenix appears to be the current
frontrunner.
