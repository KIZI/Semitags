A wave of gun violence in the New York City borough of Bronx has resulted in 14
gunshot victims and left two dead, local officials said on Saturday.

A 19-year-old man hosting a party in his apartment in the Bronx was fatally
shot, and three more teenagers wounded after someone opened fire from a hallway
into the apartment early Saturday, police said.

Investigators said they believed several shots were fired, by one or more
people, around the doorway to the sixth-floor apartment, at 1454 Grand
Concourse, in Morrisania.

The shooting was one of several across the city overnight on Saturday, according
to the police.

In a second deadly incident that took place a little after 3 a. m. on Saturday,
a 16-year-old boy was fatally shot in the back in front of 1160 Cromwell Avenue.
He was brought to Lincoln Hospital and declared dead, the police said.

Authorities are still investigating both incidents.

Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. said in a statement that nine shootings
took place in his borough last night, resulting in 14 victims.

Neither Diaz nor the police said whether any of the nine incidents were related.

Diaz said he will meet with both the Bronx's commanding officer of patrol and
the borough's district attorney to discuss ways to combat gun violence.

Violent crime is up in every category in the Bronx, with more than 70 murders
this year, according to the police.
