Liberal dims demonstrate a miserable failure to lead

That's because they don't know HOW to lead.  They are a party of hate
and dissention and that's all they will EVER be.

When the goal is failure, the wise choose not to lead or follow.

Better that than corrupt, greedy Republican carpetbaggers.  Democrats
have never marched like goose-stepping Republicans.  Life is complicated
so there is room to dissent.  Give a bone-headed idea to a Republican
and they'll all think it's the best thing since sliced bread.

It's a sign that the Democrats are doing well when Karl "It Was My
Treasonous Idea to Out Plame" Rove takes the time to put them  down using
his own name in a piece that could only be published in an extreme right
wing hate web site.

Karl, your president has a rating worse than Nixon's.  Heckuva job, Turd
Blossom.
