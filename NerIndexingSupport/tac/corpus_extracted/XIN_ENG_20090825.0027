Speaker of the Palestinian National Council (PNC) announced Monday that he has
invited 500 PNC members for a two-day unusual session in the West Bank city of
Ramallah on Aug. 26.

Salim al-Za'noon, speaker of the PNC, or parliament of the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO), told a news conference here that the invited PNC members
include 73 Islamic Hamas lawmakers.

"The 500 PNC members are living in 30 countries, half of them are in the Gaza
Strip," said al-Za'noon, hoping that Hamas rulers of the enclave will not ban
their travel to the West Bank to join the PNC meetings.

On Aug. 4, Hamas, which seized the Gaza Strip by force in June 2007, banned the
travel of some 400 Gaza congress members to go to Bethlehem to join the sixth
general conference of Fatah, the first in 20 years.

"The (PNC) meeting will be unusual and special only to choose candidates for the
vacant posts in the executive committee of PLO, after six of the committee
members had died," said al- Za'noon.

Among the 500 invitees, there are 73 Hamas lawmakers from the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, who are also PNC members according to the law, said al-Za'noon. According
to the PNC law, all the 132 PLC members are members of the PNC.

Hamas, which is not yet member of the PLO, won the last legislative elections
held in the Palestinian territories in January 2006. Hamas dominated the
parliament with 73 seats out of 132, while its rival Fatah only won 43 seats.

Hamas movement, which rules the Gaza Strip, and is not yet a PLO member,
announced that it decided to boycott the PNC convention due on Wednesday. Hamas
considered the session as " illegal and against previous understandings."

"Hamas should read carefully chapter (14) in the PNC charter. There are three
kinds of PNC meetings. The absence of Hamas members doesn't mean to leave the
PLO a hostage in the hands of anybody,"  said al-Za'noon.

He added that after 6 of the 18 members of the PLO executive committee had died
during the past 20 years, and one member still cannot attend the committee's
sessions, the committee would loose its legal quorum.

"Therefore, and according to the law, the PNC has to hold an emergency meeting
to elect members in the PLO executive committee that replace those who died in
order to have the legal quorum that enables the executive committee to meet in
the future and make decisions," said al-Za'noon.
