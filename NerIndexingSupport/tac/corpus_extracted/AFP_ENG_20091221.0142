British rock star Peter Doherty was arrested as he left court Monday, moments
after escaping a prison sentence after admitting drink-driving.

Doherty, 30, was held on suspicion of possessing a controlled drug following an
appearance at Gloucester Crown Court in southwest England.

He was earlier fined 2,050 pounds (2,300 euros, 3,300 dollars) and banned from
driving for 18 months.

It is only the latest run-in with the law for the Babyshambles and former
Libertines singer -- he has 21 previous drug offences and six previous motoring
offences to his name.

And earlier this month, he apologised for singing the Nazi anthem "Deutschland,
Deutschland ueber alles" during a concert in Munich, Germany, saying he was
unaware it would cause offence.
