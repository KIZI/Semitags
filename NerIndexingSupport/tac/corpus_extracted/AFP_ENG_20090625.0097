England, just days after winning the women's World Twenty20 title, went down to
a 34-run Twenty20 loss to Australia in Derby on Thursday.

England had defeated their arch-rivals in a dramatic World Twenty20 semi-final
run chase at the Oval last week, with Claire Taylor and Beth Morgan scoring 122
off 78 balls, before going on to beat New Zealand comprehensively in the final.

But it was a different story on Thursday with Taylor's 31 the top score in a
total of 117 for six made in reply to Australia's 151 for three.

Former Australia captain Karen Rolton made 43 not out while Shelley Nitschke was
named player of the match for her 32 and one wicket for 21 runs.
