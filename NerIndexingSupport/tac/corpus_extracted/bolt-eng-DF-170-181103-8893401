"Our blacks are so much better than their blacks," she said, speaking of Democrats. "To become a black Republican, you don't just roll into it. You're not going with the flow...and that's why we have very impressive blacks in the Republican party."

 

Well, in that context, she is correct.

It was funny how the title misleads from the context.

Obviously she meant it takes strong conviction and a lot of courage, to go against the grain, by being a black republican, but feel free to turn this into a pro kkk comment.

In her opinion it is harder to be a black conservative than a black liberal in the american culture.

Why does she think this......let me have a black conservative explain it to you by telling you his own experiences as a black conservative.

They must let her, she is evidently a "strong", GOP woman, and the others follow her words. But itsn't that the black mans dream? An employed blonde white woman, that likes her black mens.  
 
 
huh.

And Cain thinks most blacks are brainwashed.

Pretty amusing.

You are asking us if we defend the SPIN of the situation.

No...the way you spun what she said....we dont defend that sentiment.

However, the context of what she said, without the spin? We agree 100%.

Hannity, the whacko Savage and so many others.. yes they are entertainers... even when they have entertainment talk shows on news stations.. and Fox is not the only one.. CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS, MSNBC, etc ALL hire entertainers disguised as news commentators..

Now.. the news channels, Fox, CNN, etc are not inherently entertainment in their actual news reporting... but as stated, all add in the entertainment 'talk show' crapola
 
 
What's wrong with her statement is that taking the "Harder" position (in her opinion) somehow makes them "better."

You see, you opt to take it out of context and run with it.
You have every opportunity to hear the context it was said...and every opportunity to read on this site exactly WHY it was said..

But to you, that would be no fun.

So, instead, you continue to take it out of context.

So it is one of two things...

Either you are too dense to understand what Coulter meant by it...

or...

You are very insecure about the positions you hold so you feel the NEED to intentionally take things out of context so you can feel better about your personal sentiments.

So tell me...which one is it?

To clarify coulter's position a conservative position is what is better in the situation. In Coulter's opinoin, being a black conservative is harder than being a black liberal in our culture and being a conervative is better than being a liberal anytime. That is her view.

it does.

With anyone of any race of any trade and any intelligence.

The harder it is to acheive success the better a person you become.

If one is fed with a silver spoon, they lack many attributes....and have no reason to build up those attributes.

"Our** blacks are better than their blacks" by itself is the same context as adding a "because such and such a reason."

Adding her reasoning doesn't change the meaning of the original clause, it just shows her attempt to justify her conclusion. It's pig headed. Is anyone "better than me" because they are Conservative? Does going against the grain make someone "better" than someone else? No, it doesn't.

I'm going to try to get you to think here by presenting 2 questions.

Do you think those with liberal veiwpoints are better than those with conservative viewpoints? I have many posts by you to refer back to so I already know the answer.

Does coulter think those with conservative viewpoints are better than those with liberal viewpoints? I have many statments by her which show that she does.

Do I have to connect the rest of the dots?

I did not need to add her reasoning. I listened to the enitre conversation. If you did with an ipen mind, yuou would not even enter this thread.

Funny thing.....I was told by you and many that Wrights sermons were taken out of context.

SO I listened to the one about "Americans Chickens were coming back to roost".....and I gotta tell you.....that was a blatant attack on US policy.....not out opf context whatsoever....

You're wrong about your first question. No, I don't judge people by their political leanings and never have. I only razz internet Conservatives more b/c the internet ones have alotta douche in the group. For proof that I don't, I have a song in the music room making fun of many liberals.

So, faulty premise.

Question #2. Her thinking that is pig-headed.

You can be Conservative and one day risk your life to save another.
You can be Conservative and refuse to risk your life for anyone but yourself.

I'd much rather judge one's character by their selflessness than their political ideaology, and to me: it's pigheaded to judge someone based solely one 1 aspect of life anyways. It's pigheaded and closed-minded, like I said.

I'll take your word for it even though your past posts on the forum say something else.

That being said I would like to know what someone who is open minded like you claim you are thinks was horrendous about what she said in its full context. I'm curious and would like to know.

Umm, no.

The statement can't be taken out of context because the added context keeps the statement the same, it doesn't paint it in a different light at all.

When she says "our blacks" she's clearly pointing to "our side" as-in, Conservative. Thus, without her added context, shes saying they're better because theyre conservative.

If you add her context, she's saying they're better because they're conservative.

There was no change of context in calling her statement pig headed - it's pig headed with or without her justification. You don't judge a person solely on their Politics.
 
 
 
 
 
"Are blacks are better than their blacks" by itself is the same context as adding a "because such and such a reason."

Adding her reasoning doesn't change the meaning of the original clause, it just shows her attempt to justify her conclusion. It's pig headed. Is anyone "better than me" because they are Conservative? Does going against the grain make someone "better" than someone else? No, it doesn't.

 

I heard the interview.

I did not need to add her reasoning. I listened to the enitre conversation. If you did with an ipen mind, yuou would not even enter this thread.

Funny thing.....I was told by you and many that Wrights sermons were taken out of context.

SO I listened to the one about "Americans Chickens were coming back to roost".....and I gotta tell you.....that was a blatant attack on US policy.....not out opf context whatsoever....

And here you are....arguing the other side.

 

Umm, no.

The statement can't be taken out of context because the added context keeps the statement the same, it doesn't paint it in a different light at all.

When she says "our blacks" she's clearly pointing to "our side" as-in, Conservative. Thus, without her added context, shes saying they're better because theyre conservative.

Forget my last post, you just answered my question.

If that is your opinion on the issue then I don't take issue with your opinion at all.
 
 
 
 
 
I'm going to try to get you to think here by presenting 2 questions.

Do you think those with liberal veiwpoints are better than those with conservative viewpoints? I have many posts by you to refer back to so I already know the answer.

Does coulter think those with conservative viewpoints are better than those with liberal viewpoints? I have many statments by her which show that she does.

Do I have to connect the rest of the dots?

 

You're wrong about your first question. No, I don't judge people by their political leanings and never have. I only razz internet Conservatives more b/c the internet ones have alotta douche in the group. For proof that I don't, I have a song in the music room making fun of many liberals.

So, faulty premise.

Question #2. Her thinking that is pig-headed.

You can be Conservative and one day risk your life to save another.
You can be Conservative and refuse to risk your life for anyone but yourself.

I'd much rather judge one's character by their selflessness than their political ideaology, and to me: it's pigheaded to judge someone based solely one 1 aspect of life anyways. It's pigheaded and closed-minded, like I said.

 

I'll take your word for it even though your past posts on the forum say something else.

That being said I would like to know what someone who is open minded like you claim you are thinks was horrendous about what she said in its full context. I'm curious and would like to know.

 

I explained why - in the post you quoted here. Jesus

To clarify coulter's position a conservative position is what is better in the situation. In Coulter's opinoin, being a black conservative is harder than being a black liberal in our culture and being a conervative is better than being a liberal anytime. That is her view.

 

It's also her opinion that the superior "Drill Baby Drill" CON$ do not have slogans.  

June 9, 2011
RUSH: Ann, do you mean...? In "mob," do you mean physical, literal mob-like behavior, or do you mean intellectual mob-like? What kind of mob behavior do you mean here?

COULTER: That's a great question, because it's both, actually. The first quarter of the book is on how liberals are a psychological mob. It has to do with their slogans, how they formulate arguments. They get a lot of slogans, whereas conservatives just don't speak in slogans and we don't understand slogans, and for good reason: It's always sort of glib and superficially appealing, but if you stop and actually think about it for five seconds, slogans never make sense.

Well, let me explain it to you. She is saying that CON$ are better than Libs because CON$ don't have slogans. But obviously "Drill Baby Drill" CON$ DO have slogans so her rationalizations of CON$ervative superiority are pure bullshit from a delusional mind.
Get It???

If you've ever read any of her writings, she's the poster child for the insecure projectionist. Everything she writes of her "leftist boogymen" can be ascribed to her, personally.

She gets her theories about what they are, and do, by thinking "what would I do."

A narcissistic cynic.

In this post alone you are indirectly admitting that you not only did not watch the Coulter discussion but worse, you are taking little snippets from others posts to determine what was said and the context it was siad in.

For if you watched it you would have heard how the term "our" came into play as it was a discussion about blacks opn the libneral side and blacks on the conservative side....so in context, she used the term "our" to let it be known who she was referring to.

And if you had watched it you would have saw how the conversation trended to discussing how conservative blacks are treated differetnly than liberal blacks, be they in politics or not....by the media and by their peers

And if you had watched it you would have understood how, as the conversation evolved, she explained how conservative blacks are forced to overcome larger hurdles as they are deeemed as "out of the norm" and thus, when they acheive success, they are better people for it.

But you obviously didnt watch it so I am wasting my tyime right now.
 
 
 
Coulter tries each black man out personaly

 

Now, what the Hell is the point of stupid comments like that? You got a problem with Coulter? Fine, I can't stand the bitch either. But where the fuck do you get off sticking your nose into her alleged sex life as if it somehow has anything to do with anything here? Do you mean to imply that a white woman who has sex with black men can't possibly have any credibility? Great, so now you're racist AND sexist. Which means we all know EXACTLY how much credibility to give anything you say on this board ever again.
 
 
Imagine this.

Rachel Maddow says "our blacks are better than your blacks."

Republican heads around the country explode and charges of racism are never ending.

works for me, cause that's the way it is now for Conservatives. I think we've all been called racists at least 480 times.. I think it's cool beans..

Hmmm...

You seem to forget that Cain was painted by Maddow and other liberal pundits as a "plant" by the GOP.

You seem to have forgotten how the black conservative that was interviewed at a tea party ralley was painted by Maddow and other liberal pundits as a plant by the GOP.

Now...if THOSE two items in themselves dont SUPPORT what Coulter said...then you just refuse to accept the truth.

You STILL don't get it!

So let me get this straight...

You dont think that a man who is seen by the majority of his own race as INFERIOR to them based on his ideology, strives to get to the top of the polls regardless isnt as better man for it?

So you do not see him as better than people who judged him based on his ideology?

I do.

I agree, there's certainly a hypocritical element in condoning one of "their own" to say something that the "others" would not be tolerated to say. But as someone said earlier, context is key in these things. Coulter's entire purpose is to enrage people with inflammatory comments that are carefully crafted to preempt criticism. Here, she's invoking racial sensitivities purposely, and wrapping it up as if a compliment. But in truth she's doing three things:

1) She's crying for attention in the same kind of way that Howard Stern and Glenn Beck do.

2) She's subtly insulting a group of people based on race.

3) She's avoiding any meaningful political discourse in favor of exchanging high-fives with people who already sit on her side of the spectrum.

OK...go for it.
Bottom line...if you had watched the conversation you would not have even entered this thread...
It was that obvious that there was nothing wrong with what she said.

And by the way...I followed your advice...you told me I took the "chickens home to roost" sermon out of context a while back...and yoiu suggested I listen to the sermon before making a judgement call.

I did.

And I realized....YOU DIDNT.

That sermon alone....NOTHING was taken out of context. It was a very negative US policy sermon with very disturbing moments of "it serrves you right" presnted by Wirght as it pertianed to terrorism on our homeland.

It was quite distrubbing to listen to...I suggest you do it.

I do.

 

No, I don't see how.

There's a difference between him being a better man...than he was before....through adversity.

And saying he's better than someone else just because they're Politically not the same and don't share that same particular adversity.

It's denying the fact that: life outside of politics happens.

Some liberal could have overcome 12X a Conservative's struggles, but a closed minded pighead would assume that a black conservative's "struggle" makes him a better man than any black liberal could be based solely on his idealogical struggle. It's beyond ridiculous, which is much what any Ann Coulter statement is.

again...you did nmot listen to the conversation.

She was not just discussing politics. She discussed his success in business as well.

Do what you suggested to me..

Listen to the dialogue...THEN debate it.]

Just wsihed you practiced what you preached with Wrights sermon.....I was disgusted by what he said...and you would have been too if you had listened to it.

One thing for sure...you NEVER would have said I took his sermon out of context.

And saying he's better than someone else just because they're Politically not the same and don't share that same particular adversity.

It's denying the fact that: life outside of politics happens.

Some liberal could have overcome 12X a Conservative's struggles, but a closed minded pighead would assume that a black conservative's "struggle" makes him a better man than any black liberal could be based solely on his idealogical struggle. It's beyond ridiculous, which is much what any Ann Coulter statement is.

 

again...you did nmot listen to the conversation.

She was not just discussing politics. She discussed his success in business as well.

Do what you suggested to me..

Listen to the dialogue...THEN debate it.]

Just wsihed you practiced what you preached with Wrights sermon.....I was disgusted by what he said...and you would have been too if you had listened to it.

One thing for sure...you NEVER would have said I took his sermon out of context.

 

I did listen, dipshit.

Discussing Cain's Business success is discussing CAIN
Discussing "our blacks," is discussing Conservative Blacks, as a group.
You *did* take his sermon out of Context.
 
 
 
Even if this is scrpted by the right wing power it is fun to watch. It's like watching "Dumb and Dumber".

 

What's really funny is that you don't grasp that you are "dumber."
 
 
"My only regret with Timothy McVeigh is he did not go to the New York Times Building."

Funny how the left don't get the whole 'context' thing. Makes me laugh... and makes it really easy to hang them with their own rope.

 

Do you think Coulter realizes just how stupid leftists are? That they simply don't grasp sarcasm and irony?

Regardless, she is damned funny, razor sharp wit.

I must have hit a nerve.

No GT...you did not listen to it.

Every post you put up on here regarding what COulter said makes it quite clear you did not hear the entire dialogue.

Nor did you listen to Wrights sermon. Other sermons may have been taken ouyt of context...but the chickens home to roost one? That sermon was all about US Policy and how it serves the US right now that the terrorism is on our shores.

And by the way...dipshit rolls off my shoulder...but I did not know you and I had that kind of relationship on here. I guess you live and learn.
 
 
 
 
Imagine this.

Rachel Maddow says "our blacks are better than your blacks."

Republican heads around the country explode and charges of racism are never ending.

 

I agree, there's certainly a hypocritical element in condoning one of "their own" to say something that the "others" would not be tolerated to say. But as someone said earlier, context is key in these things. Coulter's entire purpose is to enrage people with inflammatory comments that are carefully crafted to preempt criticism. Here, she's invoking racial sensitivities purposely, and wrapping it up as if a compliment. But in truth she's doing three things:

1) She's crying for attention in the same kind of way that Howard Stern and Glenn Beck do.

2) She's subtly insulting a group of people based on race.

3) She's avoiding any meaningful political discourse in favor of exchanging high-fives with people who already sit on her side of the spectrum.

 

Good post. I'd also say she is engaging in race baiting.

Since you stated it as a quote, I will assume it is legit.

In context or out of context...that was a heartless, chilish immature thing she said.

But then again, I never liked Coulter....nor do I like Hannity or Rush...only becuase I am not one for the "sensationalism" on what are supposed to be news discussions.

Albeit, it is being used as a race thing....but it was not meant to be such.

Yes, but you have an IQ of what, 12, Rati?
 
 
Look...lets be real here.

Conservative blacks are successful. clean and articulate.
Liberal blacks are hoods, dropouts and lazy good for nothings.

Of course conservative blacks are better.

There....does that make all of you feel better?
 
 
 
 Ann Coulter On Herman Cain: 'Our Blacks Are So Much Better Than Their Blacks' (VIDEO) 

The Allegations against him are false. Just because they say so.   Mann Coulter takes the cake with this one.

 

Unspecified accusations by unnamed sources reported by a liberal rag. And to NOT believe that is sheep. Wow, you are sheep.
 
 
 
 
 
wrong....

You are asking us if we defend the SPIN of the situation.

No...the way you spun what she said....we dont defend that sentiment.

However, the context of what she said, without the spin? We agree 100%.

 

Ok I get it, saying "our blacks are better than yours" is acceptable. Thanks for the info  

 

Well you were being honest up until this point. Did you realize you had no legitimate comeback to diminish the facts of the situation that you tried to avoid in the first post and decide to take this route instead of a real discussion?

 

Says the guy who defended Coulter while saying you're not defending anything. You expect what? An honest debate? On what? You wont take a position on it, I've asked many times are you defending her comment? Are you?

True or false: she says "our blacks" are better because it's a struggle to be a Conservative because it's not accepted by your families, neighbors, etc.

Which is what I've been using as her judtification all along in my points, only to be followed up by you trying to tell me that it's taking her out of context? Either you're pretty dumb, or forgot English today.

exact quote: "all liberals see are "conservative black man." look at how they go after allen west. look at how they go after michael steele. i mean all of them with wonderful qualities, i mean, that's why our blacks are so much better than their blacks. to become a black republican, you dont just rollll into it. you're not just going with the flow. you have fought against probably your family members,......etc et.c etc..........."

True or false: I did not deny that was her "reasoning."

True or false: I laid out why I disagree, wholeheartedly, with her reasoning.

Three true or falses. dipshit.

That's what she said? Worse than I thought....no one went after West and Steele because they are black. They went after them because they are stupid. I'm mean, seriously stupid.

Oh yeah, she's a race baiter.

And since you listened to his entire Sermon and still don't get the point of the sermon which is painfully obvious, here is someone who summarizes it WAY better for you then I ever could. It would help if you don't go judging shit you don't even understand.

 The full story behind Wright 

I do consider you a dipshit, because you ignore what people actually say, and read what you want to read, and comment on what you think they said but didn't actually say.

Like here, for instance: I'm saying that being a black conservative doesn't make you "Better" than being a black liberal, because of it being "against the grain" which is the premise of her argument.

And you're saying that's not her argument, and I didn't watch it, etc. when it's by ALL MEANS her argument. I think you're on another planet of dipshit.

no...YOU may have gone after them becuase of their ideas...I dont doubt that....yours dilike of them are not based on race....

But MANY said they were GOP shills...plants......and THAT was what she was referring to.
 
 
Liberals have started a race/class war and now they don't quite know what to do with it.

Hilarious.
 
 
 
Oh yeah, she's a race baiter.

 

This is my issue with Ann Coulter as well. I want to be bigger then liberals, not like them.

Tell Cain to have the Board release the information. The women cant be revealed because of a confidentiality agreement. Politico is a right leaning rag.

All that has nothing to do with this simple fact: Without proof, you believe him. Without proof, I dont believe him. You believe him because of where the source comes from which has nothing to do with fact or fiction. I dont believe him because he's told 5 different stories one contridicting the other.

The one constant in America is that leftists hate.

Who and what y'all hate is variable, but hate is the foundation of the left.

Ever was it so.
 
 
Blacks make up roughly 12-13% of population, yet we may two running against each other in the Presidential election, if Republicans think their black man can beat the Democrat's black man. Talk about placing party ahead of everything else. Sheesh. However, Cain does not have the organization yet to really run a competitive Presidential campaign against Obama, so this entire discussion is moot. Republicans would be foolish to nominate him. Right now, their only legitimate chance to beat Obama is with Romney. Clear thinking members in the GOP should prevail over the Tea Party Rightwingnuts in the state primaries, and this will come down to what we all knew from the beginning: Romney v. Obama - and a very close race in 2012. The rest of it is just entertainment.

WHAT THE FUCK DOES OBAMA HAVE TO DO WITH THIS?? I dont want Cain to release anything. You said they were "unspecified allegations". Cain can help give you specifics since you require it to be believed. He can keep them secret for all I care.

I told you why I dont believe him, he's changed his story. You have to feel some sorta way about it or else you wouldnt be human. So stop pretending.

Cain isn't running as a "Black Man," but as a conservative. Cain appeals to those the GOP has abandoned, those who work hard and play by the rules. They know the democrats hate them, but have little support from the Republicans either. Cain offers them a voice.

Barack Obama represents the values of Wall Street Shitters, Herman Cain represents the values of Main Street Americans.

whoa...wait a minute...

The discussion last night was about the attacks on Cain....including blacks calling him an Uncle Tom, a sell out, and a GOP plant.

It was not a discussion of "our black candidate is better than their black candidate".

And I agree that Cain is not a good call for the nomination. He needs some exposure to washington.

However, I disagree with Romney as the only viabnle candidate. I think Newt is by far the brightest and the most knowledgable as it pertains to dealing with the childish anitcs of congress.

Obama is suffering right now becuase he did not know what to expect. I believe Newt knows.
 
 
The wheels have come off again  
 
 
 
 
 
Well, let me explain it to you. She is saying that CON$ are better than Libs because CON$ don't have slogans. But obviously "Drill Baby Drill" CON$ DO have slogans so her rationalizations of CON$ervative superiority are pure bullshit from a delusional mind.
Get It???

 

 

Oh I got it before you entered the thread, we alreay said Coulter thinks Conservatives are better than Liberals....keep up dude!

 

 

You STILL don't get it!  
The point is her rationalizations of CON$ervative superiority are not only moronic, they are dead wrong! As wrong as saying "Drill Baby Drill" CON$ do not have slogans.
IOW, no amount of "context" will ever make her rationalizations any less ridiculous!
Get it now?

 

No I got it before. I didn't, as you do, claim she was right or wrong I just stated that she thinks conservatives are better than liberals because they are conservative.

Let me guess....your rebuttle will say I worship rush limbaugh or something next  

For the record I'm not a coulter, hannity, or limbaugh fan...i dislike all of them for the same reason I hold a negative opinion of you, they are political hacks who view everything based on their own ideology and are incapable of seeing past said ideology.
 
 
The part where Ann Coulter says that those voting against the 1964 Civil Rights act weren't all southerners but they were all Democrats? She doesn't know what the hell she's talking about. It WAS all southeners that voted against it and all northerners voted for it. There were some southerners that voted for it but not much and EVERY SINGLE ONE was a Democrat
 
 
Ok, my numbers were slightly off but it was still southeners, not Democrats

By party and region
Note: "Southern", as used in this section, refers to members of Congress from the eleven states that made up the Confederate States of America in the American Civil War. "Northern" refers to members from the other 39 states, regardless of the geographic location of those states.
The original House version:
Southern Democrats: 787 (7%93%)

 Ann Coulter On Herman Cain: 'Our Blacks Are So Much Better Than Their Blacks' (VIDEO) 

The Allegations against him are false. Just because they say so.   Mann Coulter takes the cake with this one.

 

 
"Our blacks are so much better than their blacks," she said, speaking of Democrats. "To become a black Republican, you don't just roll into it. You're not going with the flow...and that's why we have very impressive blacks in the Republican party."

 

Well, in that context, she is correct.

It was funny how the title misleads from the context.

 

 
 
 
 

Oh I got it before you entered the thread, we alreay said Coulter thinks Conservatives are better than Liberals....keep up dude!

 

 

You STILL don't get it!  
The point is her rationalizations of CON$ervative superiority are not only moronic, they are dead wrong! As wrong as saying "Drill Baby Drill" CON$ do not have slogans.
IOW, no amount of "context" will ever make her rationalizations any less ridiculous!
Get it now?

 

No I got it before. I didn't, as you do, claim she was right or wrong I just stated that she thinks conservatives are better than liberals because they are conservative.

Let me guess....your rebuttle will say I worship rush limbaugh or something next  

For the record I'm not a coulter, hannity, or limbaugh fan...i dislike all of them for the same reason I hold a negative opinion of you, they are political hacks who view everything based on their own ideology and are incapable of seeing past said ideology.

 

Care to spin how saying she is "correct" is not saying she is "right?"  
 
 
 
Ok, my numbers were slightly off but it was still southeners, not Democrats

By party and region
Note: "Southern", as used in this section, refers to members of Congress from the eleven states that made up the Confederate States of America in the American Civil War. "Northern" refers to members from the other 39 states, regardless of the geographic location of those states.
The original House version:
Southern Democrats: 787 (7%93%)
Southern Republicans: 010 (0%100%)
Northern Democrats: 145-9 (94%6%)
Northern Republicans: 138-24 (85%15%)
The Senate version:
Southern Democrats: 120 (5%95%)
Southern Republicans: 01 (0%100%)
Northern Democrats: 45-1 (98%2%)
Northern Republicans: 27-5 (84%16%)

A better way to put it is:

15% Northern Republicans against
6% Northern Democrats against

SENATE

95% Southern Democrats against

Funny how the left don't get the whole 'context' thing. Makes me laugh... and makes it really easy to hang them with their own rope.

 

Context? You think that context makes her sound any better?       She could come up with a 200 page thesis on why, in her opinion, conservative blacks are better than liberal blacks, and she would still sound like a clueless partisan nut. That's what you guys don't get: the entire argument is asinine. Imagine if Chris Matthews said that liberal whites are better than conservative whites - or Hispanics or blacks for that matter. You would be on here calling him an ass in a second - and for good reason, because that type of rhetoric DOES make you sound like an ass.
 
 
 
 
 
Do you claim she is something more?? Because I certainly don't and never have

 

Hannity too? How about Fox News? Thats just entertainment too?

 

Hannity is an opinion show not a hard news show. The opinion shows ARE there for entertainment.

 

The entire Fox "News" organization is an "opinion show"... and a tasteless one at that... Coulter is a sensational hate monger; and entertainer or no, she is always in poor taste  
 
 
 
 
 
Ahhh, the ol non defense defense. You agree she knows what it takes to be black and conservative, right?

 

In her opinion it is harder to be a black conservative than a black liberal in the american culture.

Why does she think this......let me have a black conservative explain it to you by telling you his own experiences as a black conservative.

What's wrong with her statement is that taking the "Harder" position (in her opinion) somehow makes them "better."

 

To clarify coulter's position a conservative position is what is better in the situation. In Coulter's opinoin, being a black conservative is harder than being a black liberal in our culture and being a conervative is better than being a liberal anytime. That is her view.

 

I already explained it guys...here.

She is correct, black conservatives do have more pushback from our culture for their positions. Her opinion is that to put up with that and stay a conservative, plus just being a conservative, makes black conservatives "better" than black liberals.

Do you want examples of this pushback for black conservatives?

these are just what one black man has had to deal with, i can give you dozens of videos like this.

  is that your only comeback to my proof that blacks who are conservative have to deal with a lot of pushback that blacks who are liberal do not face?

Thanks for proving that the point being made this whole time was correct...if it wasn't you would have had a substantial counter-point by now.

Yeah, that's Right! CON$ never accuse Liberal blacks of getting everything they have from affirmative action. Yeah, CON$ never accuse Liberal blacks of always looking for a hand out.

No, CON$ are the sweetest kindest people on Earth with never a negative word about anyone, but who are constantly picked on by everyone because they are just too nice for their own good.

I said she was correct that blacks face greater scruitny of their political views for being conservative than they do if they are liberal.

I didn't claim that her saying that this scruitny makes conservatives blacks "better" than liberal blacks was right or wrong.

2 different aspects of the discussion....do you understand the difference in what each statement was talking about now?

One more time...she is correct that conservative blacks face greater scruitny for their political positions but I don't know if that really makes black conservatives "better" than black liberals even though it is her opinion that it does.

I didn't edit anything I directly quoted your cut ups of my posts.

Once again.....since you don't understand the difference

I said she was correct that blacks face greater scruitny of their political views for being conservative than they do if they are liberal.

I didn't claim that her saying that this scruitny makes conservatives blacks "better" than liberal blacks was right or wrong.

I know that the hate sites tell to you scream "Nazi" at the infidels who have not accepted Barack as their personal lord and savior; but tell us sparky, what SPECIFICALLY makes me a "Nazi?"
 
 
 
You have to feel some sorta way about it or else you wouldnt be human. So stop pretending.

 

In general, I'm not sure I have to have some opinion on every subject in which I know nothing about it.

But in this case that every time a non-liberal black man starts to go somewhere he's lynched by the liberal media does in fact start to make me skeptical of all these stories. Particularly one for which they can produce no evidence and the story is told by a clearly left agenda source. Though I did already say it was the media, sorry for being redundant on that...

oh look you are talking out of your hole again and not the one on your face.

We have the context and its still quite stupid of her to say, even though she is trying for shock value and attention...Ann is an attention Whore. Like Al Sharpton. The only reason her words have any power is because you give it to her.
