Both of these developments are perfectly logical, refreshingly practical
and entirely consistent with the Obama administration's promise to close
Gitmo by the end of the year. For years, remember, the closure of the base
has been a bipartisan goal, opposed only by the worst ideologues in both
parties.

But now that we're actually facing the tough moral and political choices
necessary to closing Guantanamo, politicians are running for cover. Take
Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan. The senior senator from the Sunflower State was
cheering along with all the rest of us when President George W. Bush told us
in late 2001 that we'd need to sacrifice in the name of winning the war on
terror. Now, however, Brownback has gone into full Chicken Little mode,
warning anyone who will listen that Gitmo should not be emptied and closed
after all because it's too dangerous to have prisoners at Ft. Leavenworth.
"We don't want them here," he said on Monday. "They should be treated with
dignity and humanely, but it shouldn't be here."

This is the terror-law equivalent of a "not in my backyard" mentality
that has thwarted the resolution of thorny issues in America for centuries.
Except that the problem of what to do with the detainees is not like the
problem of what to do with the nuclear waste bound for Yucca Mountain. The
prisoners are men, mortals, and they won't be around for a half-life. They
aren't even the "worst of the worst," a grossly unfair label that men such
as former Attorneys General Alberto R. Gonzales and John Ashcroft placed on
them despite strong evidence to the contrary.

A great many terrorists have been successfully prosecuted and sentenced
under federal criminal law -- both before and after Sept. 11, 2001. The
roster of current maximum-security federal inmates reads like a Who's Who of
Terrorism: Zacarias Moussaoui, Richard Reid, Jose Padilla, Ramzi Yousef, 
Ahmed Ressam (not to mention home-grown lovelies such as  Terry Nichols and
Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber).

If Gitmo detainees are transferred to Kansas, it will not become a
battlefield for terrorists any more than Colorado has become a scene of
carnage in the years since terror-convicts have been sent to the federal 
"supermax" facility there. The prisoners incarcerated in Kansas, before or
after trial, would be part of a system that is as safe as the world has ever
known. I have toured the  supermax facility, and I defy anyone who also has
done so to suggest that it, or a new, similar prison, could not safely house
the prisoners until they die, are transferred elsewhere or are
released.

Brownback's got the scare tactics down, but what tangible proof does he
have that bringing detainees to Kansas (or anywhere else in America, for
that matter) will make Americans less safe? More pointedly, why does he
think that keeping Gitmo a working prison for terror suspects is a better
alternative than trying to disperse them in groups to the States for
processing? We aren't talking about Khalid Sheikh Mohammed or Ramzi
Binalshibh, remember, we are talking mostly about men who are used to being
led, not to leading or planning.

It's time for Brownback to become a statesman in the old-fashioned sense
of that word, putting aside parochialism for the sake of the country. The
senator shouldn't be worrying his constituents that the sky will fall on
them if more prisoners come there -- there already are more dangerous men in
prison in Kansas than exist at Gitmo. Instead, he should be using his
considerable rhetorical skills to sell his fellow Kansans on the idea that
if the men are to be placed somewhere, it ought to be right there in the
heartland, with its long tradition of housing dangerous prisoners safely and
securely.

Like the Bush administration before it, the Obama White House is
doggedly trying to fix the mess caused by Guantanamo's status as an
international symbol of American excess. The White House and the departments
of Defense and Justice should push these measures through, and lawmakers who
oppose them should get out of the way.
