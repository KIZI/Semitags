The Season opener is Tuesday and the mighty celtics have the deepest team since the 1986 super team. We can put 5 hall of famers on the floor at the same time. Our bench could be a better than.500 team by themselves. Garnett isn't dragging the leg around anymore and looks more like the Garnett of the 2008 championship team. Pierce and Ray Allen look to be in top shape. Rondo, already arguably the best PG in the league, continues to improve. Even the deep bench with the likes of Semih Erden and Luke Harangody looks like they could give us productive minutes.

It will not be a perfect season. Because our team is old, expect injuries thoughout the season. Look for the coaching staff to use the old timers sparingly so as to have all the horses healthy come playoff time.

Banner 18 gets raised this year.

 
 
 
Oh haven't you heard? The Miami Heat are gonna' pass the Bulls single season win record and win the NBA title for the next decade or two!

There might as well not even be any other NBA teams.  
 
 
Heat Schmeat. They'll have a bunch of regular season wins but just you wait and see, the Celts will take them in 6 or less come playoff time. They are thin in the middle and at the point. They have two gunners on the wings that need the ball constantly to be effective and really what is only a decent power forward. No bench to speak of.

They're goin' down.
 
 
watch out for my knicks!!!!

no really, stop laughing
 
 
The Miami Schmeat didn't look so hot, did they? Even though we played pretty sloppy, we still beat them didn't we? Toward the end of the game, it looked a whole lot like the Cleveland team of the last few years, give it to Lebron and get out of the way, didn't it?

Green 18 baby!
