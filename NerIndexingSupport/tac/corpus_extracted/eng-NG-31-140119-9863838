Its a boon and a bane to have Dubai interested in LFC!  The Sheikh is
a long time Liverpool supporter and will do everything he believes to
be right for LFC.

At the same time, the people pf Liverpool will have no say in any
matter.

Everton may move to Kirkby, but if this happens then Liverpool will
essentially be moving to the middle-east.

If you thought Romanov and Abramovich was ????, wait till this hits
you.

Again, its too hard to say whether its a good or bad.  Only time will
tell.

G'luck!

Aye mate. I remember you giving the heads up and certain members of the
Gobshite fraternity took the piss out of you.
