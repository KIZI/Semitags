 
 
How much of your success was because of Government?....
 
 
It looks like the President is now using the same rhetoric that the fully clothed Marxist Elizabeth Warren is using, "no one made it on their own, including Steve Jobs". I'm just curious to know on a percentage basis, how much did Government have to do with your success?

I'll be generous and say maybe 15% for me, what say you?

You're joking RIGHT---       How much of my success is attributed to Government--I would be a lot more successful--if government would just get the hell out of the way.

after 9-11 my industry died. To make matters worse, our mayor offered tax breaks to companies who hired people through the city....completely putting my recruiting business to a stand still.

Furthermore, my application for a small business loan was never accepted or denied. To the contrary, they kept on asking me for more and more information to the point where I had to have my accountant deal with it. He cost me a lot of money for his time...and we STILL never got an answer.....here it is 10 years later and if I send them an email they will respond the same way they did for the first 3 years....we are reviewing your information and will get back to you in a timely manner. After 3 years of that, I stopped writing/emailing them.

SO as I see it...other than paving the roads so I can get to work...the government has actually hampered my ability to be successful.

So your success is your own imo, i wish they'd get off their high horses about roads, protection and all that nonsense, we already overpay for those "services". Where would these government hypocrites be without us?.....
 
 
My successes have been in working for government. Does that count?

Depends, do you think you would be successful without working for the government?
 
 
I give the government a little bit of credit. As a corporate turnaround guy, with one of the businesses we approached the DoD and convinced them to buy our consumer product vs. the standard issue crap they'd been buying on government contracts for a similar but utterly outdated version of that type product that dated back to WW II days.
 
 
Well now lets see.

I grew up healthy thanks to Government's intervention in food and water and preventing companies from poisoning me (accidentally of course). I attended and graduated a public school (thanks taxpayers!) which allowed me to get into a University. I was able to pay that tuition through working and Pell Grants and guaranteed loans (thanks again taxpayers!). I then moved across the country (nice highways) and was able to start working in an industry I love.

Since then, it's been all me. But I think it's fair to say I would not be where I am today without our government.

Sounds like the government should be thanking you......

Well let's see.

Did the governmet provide all those things out of the kindness of their hearts or were these things paid for by tax payers working in the private sector?
 
 
Government has made much of life more convenient with the services provided and likely overpaid for at my expense and the expense of those that came before me.
Convenience is nice.
Waste is not.
 
 
I would have to say alot, I served 7 years in the Air Force and I work for the Feds now as a civilian employee.
 
 
Well, for the hubby he was in the navy but he was successful because his parents put a good work ethic on him and he advanced. I do not give the government to much of the credit. I think he would have succeeded on which ever career he chose.
 
 
Lets see...

Government schools, government funded medical research, safe food, safe drugs, safe water, no toxic chemicals in the air, roads, bridges, infrastructure, water systems, sewerage systems, the internet, safe communities, free comerce

No...I don't think the government helped me at all. I did it all on my own

They were paid for by taxes from the private sector, obviously. That changes nothing though. The private sector never would have provided me with all those opportunities. The government did.
 
 
The Government is a success because of both of you!
 
 
 
I would have to say alot, I served 7 years in the Air Force and I work for the Feds now as a civilian employee.

 

An honorable path indeed, but i'll venture to say you could have still been successful had you chosen a different path that was unrelated to the government.

Well I attended state funded schools for 12 years then 2 years at a state funded votech school.

I would think that the govt was very helpful in getting me started for the job market.
Plus I had govt funded polio and other immunizations at school.

Its probably true, although the Military really helped me figure out alot of stuff about life in general especially in my first enlistment which was my best time in the service.

Did the navy train him? Pay him? Pay for your medical care?

Did he work for a private Navy?

I see. Your parents sent you to a private school. You have never used public roads for your business. You are immune to cholera and the other water borne diseases that the public water systems eliminated. You have never used any of the anti-biotics whose discovery the government helped fund.

 Day in the Life of Joe Middle-Class Republican 

Joe gets up at 6:00am to prepare his morning coffee. He fills his pot full of good clean drinking water because some liberal fought for minimum water quality standards. He takes his daily medication with his first swallow of coffee. His medications are safe to take because some liberal fought to insure their safety and work as advertised.

All but $10.00 of his medications are paid for by his employers medical plan because some liberal union workers fought their employers for paid medical insurance, now Joe gets it too. He prepares his morning breakfast, bacon and eggs this day. Joes bacon is safe to eat because some liberal fought for laws to regulate the meat packing industry.

Joe takes his morning shower reaching for his shampoo; His bottle is properly labeled with every ingredient and the amount of its contents because some liberal fought for his right to know what he was putting on his body and how much it contained. Joe dresses, walks outside and takes a deep breath. The air he breathes is clean because some tree hugging liberal fought for laws to stop industries from polluting our air. He walks to the subway station for his government subsidized ride to work; it saves him considerable money in parking and transportation fees. You see, some liberal fought for affordable public transportation, which gives everyone the opportunity to be a contributor.

Joe begins his work day; he has a good job with excellent pay, medicals benefits, retirement, paid holidays and vacation because some liberal union members fought and died for these working standards. Joes employer pays these standards because Joes employer doesnt want his employees to call the union. If Joe is hurt on the job or becomes unemployed hell get a worker compensation or unemployment check because some liberal didnt think he should loose his home because of his temporary misfortune.

Its noon time, Joe needs to make a Bank Deposit so he can pay some bills. Joes deposit is federally insured by the FSLIC because some liberal wanted to protect Joes money from unscrupulous bankers who ruined the banking system before the depression.

Joe has to pay his Fannie Mae underwritten Mortgage and his below market federal student loan because some stupid liberal decided that Joe and the government would be better off if he was educated and earned more money over his life-time.

Joe is home from work, he plans to visit his father this evening at his farm home in the country. He gets in his car for the drive to dads; his car is among the safest in the world because some liberal fought for car safety standards. He arrives at his boyhood home. He was the third generation to live in the house financed by Farmers Home Administration because bankers didnt want to make rural loans. The house didnt have electric until some big government liberal stuck his nose where it didnt belong and demanded rural electrification. (Those rural Republicans would still be sitting in the dark)

He is happy to see his dad who is now retired. His dad lives on Social Security and his union pension because some liberal made sure he could take care of himself so Joe wouldnt have to. After his visit with dad he gets back in his car for the ride home.

He turns on a radio talk show, the hosts keeps saying that liberals are bad and conservatives are good. (He doesnt tell Joe that his beloved Republicans have fought against every protection and benefit Joe enjoys throughout his day) Joe agrees, We dont need those big government liberals ruining our lives; after all, Im a self made man who believes everyone should take care of themselves, just like I have.

All of the above applies to me too. I went to a State University (The Ohio State University, to be exact). Got my degree in engineering. I went to work for a firm with contracts with the United States Navy. I visited every Naval Station in the Northern Command and investigated, abated, remediated and solved many environmental problems the Navy had with their bases. Asbestos, Lead Based paint, PCBs, defective waste water collection and treatment systems, I handled it all.

I now work as the county building inspector (thanks for the paycheck, county tax payers!). I maintain my home well including some pricey renovations (I am a job provider to roofers, contractors and building materials suppliers and manufacturers).

Jarhead, my industry died about 20 years ago. So I switched to another one and made more money. Seems to me that you are blaming the government for you lack of ability to find employment. So why are you not going out and getting real job instead sitting back and whining? Isn't this what you say 'Liberals' do?
 
 
To be fair if Obama wants to claim your success is due to Government he needs to look at 2 things. First most taxes are paid by the people that have been successful, not the poor or 50%ish of the people out there. So Obama got his way, the successful do pay their fair share, it's the poor that are not based on their own logic.

Secondly how if Obama wants to take credit for the success then he must also take credit for the failures, something Obama has yet to do. So the question could also be how much of your failure was because of the Government, and this is where we see how undefined and overly general Obama's definition of Government being a part of someones success.

Obama is literally one of the more stupid politicians I have ever known of. He plays for political points and not even for the long term win, short term political points.
 
 
 
 
Well, for the hubby he was in the navy but he was successful because his parents put a good work ethic on him and he advanced. I do not give the government to much of the credit. I think he would have succeeded on which ever career he chose.

 

Did the navy train him? Pay him? Pay for your medical care?

Did he work for a private Navy?

 

How does the Navy exist ? Who funds the Navy to pay for the things you stated?....

Instead of picking a number out of your hat, the way to figure this out is to look at how much of what you do now to make money would be possible if the government did not exist at all. Try that and get back to us.
 
 
What about the poor, unsuccessful, homeless, etc.... ?

If the government is responsible for every successful person, are they also responsible for the failures?....

We live in a social environment in which we all depend on people whom we never see or converse with. From the food we eat, to the planes we travel in, government rules and regulations protect us. The education that is government funded is absolutely essential to our businesses, government, and military. To state that we are so many percentages independent of government and the present social network is to ignore reality. But then, so many here are professionals at that.

I think you need to take a step back and re read what he said.

Government fucking you out of a business is hardly the same as competition, it's more like a monopoly that rapes a whole industry, who can compete? You dont invest years into your work only to just roll over into something else, if it were that easy no one would work for others.

Past all that the point I think he was making was the same as I did, how does the Government or Obama in this case claim you owe us for helping you but then just shrug off the tens of millions of people they fucked along the way.

Exccuse me?

I answered a question and rationalized why my answer was what it was.

I was not whining...I explained how the beauracracy of government actually COST me money with no return where, if they did not exist at all, would have cost me nothing

I had a choice at the time, and I chose to push oforward, loan or no loan. I succeeded and sold the company within 4 years. I took a little time off, and then started what I have now....another company with two separate divisions.

And sure, we are struggling now....but we continue to push forward.

I dont whine......I am only guilty of explaining my answer to the question.

LMFAO...and that unemployed loser "dontbestupid" actually thanked you for your post.

My successes have been in working for government. Does that count?

 

And your inflated government salary TAKES from those who don't work for the government and hinders their ability to spend or invest which fucks this economy.

I don't know what is it you do (I'm sure nothing) but I'm certain a person with your job title in the private sector works 99% harder, is 99% more efficient (due to competition) but makes about 60% of what you make...

Then you have the fucking audacity to have a 99% avatar and talk about how the middle class is dying??

The same assholes that bailed out your labor union bailed out the banks and stuck the private sector with the bill...

Your taxes pay your own salary - hence you don't pay any taxes if you work for the government..
 
 
 
I'd keep more of my money, how many government crooks would have the resources to get their grubby hands on money that isn't theirs without me?.....

 

If there were no government, there would be no government crooks, and you would have no money, so the question doesn't arise.
 
 
You know what, all you Government lovers need to just tell us all again how a business owes it’s success to the Government for “educating” our citizens, for building our roads, for protecting them with the military and so on…

Then, you can turn around and tell us all…

We need more Government because our country is on the verge of collapse due to our education system sucking, our military (wars) sucks, politicians suck, our roads and infrastructure is falling apart, waste of money here, waste there

Yes, tell us all how America owes it's success to ever growing Government then turn around, on your own and make the perfect case as to why America is falling apart despite the massive government growth we have had. I love watching you argue with yourselves.

So what is it, do the poor that does not pay taxes, the poor that you don’t want to pay any taxes pay for all the stuff the “successful” use or do the middle class and successful people pay for it, then use it? You already got your way but not shocking you’re not happy with it.

Gee, why wouldn't a private company build a state or federal highway on their own?....  

If there is a problem with inflated government contracts, and this may come as a shock, but maybe some government flunkie is either crooked or not doing their job.......
 
 
I thank God every day for the IRS, the US Postal Service, and the DMV

Fantastic!!!

Also, just today - tried contacting the Social Security Administration and was disconnected only FOUR times! This is down two. Last time I tried to call - disconnected six times.

And who could forget Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid.

Thank you, thank you, thank you! I LOVE the Government!!

Well to do that the Government would have to stop taxeing people that actually pay taxes, then you might see it happen. In fact I think many companies do pay for their own roads in many places when they build out in the middle of nowhere.

Does time in the military count?

A very large part of my success is thanks to my good decision to join the Navy.

Navy led to college, which led to a good job, which encouraged me to go to more schooling which led me to an even better job.

Because they wouldn't own it, the government would own it......

Do you think when someone drives over a bridge to get to work that they are thinking about who owns that bridge? No. They're just happy it's there.
 
 
 
 
If there were no taxpayers to fund it, there would be no government.......

 

Also true. And then you would have no money.

 

I'd still prosper, the government wouldn't.......
 
 
 
Does time in the military count?

A very large part of my success is thanks to my good decision to join the Navy.

Navy led to college, which led to a good job, which encouraged me to go to more schooling which led me to an even better job.

 

Happy Birthday <S>
And thanks for your service.
 
 
 
 
My successes have been in working for government. Does that count?

 

And your inflated government salary TAKES from those who don't work for the government and hinders their ability to spend or invest which fucks this economy.

I don't know what is it you do (I'm sure nothing) but I'm certain a person with your job title in the private sector works 99% harder, is 99% more efficient (due to competition) but makes about 60% of what you make...

Then you have the fucking audacity to have a 99% avatar and talk about how the middle class is dying??

The same assholes that bailed out your labor union bailed out the banks and stuck the private sector with the bill...

Your taxes pay your own salary - hence you don't pay any taxes if you work for the government..

 

I see these useless government worker "fucks" every morning taking the commuter train to DC in the morning. They sleep/snore all the way up, arrive at their desks - do absolutely JACK SHIT for the economy all day except create red tape - log off, ride home, and call it a day.

Unproductive fucks.

Many join the military for its perks, rather than their patriotism (I'm not saying you)..

I remember before Iraq people were joining the military in droves just for the free shit, then we went to war and many of those cowards that wanted something for nothing refused to deploy or went AWOL...

Bingo, and they get away with it because they're protected by a) unions and b) lack of competition since the government has no competition they can be just as lazy as they want. It's not like you can tell the government to go fuck off and choose one of your liking that serves you better..

Also, have you noticed government employees treat people like shit?? ever been to the DMV or in my case Secretary of States office? Instead of "Hi, how are you doing what can I do for you" its seriously "what do you want."

Oh and these assclowns are being paid 40% more than those in the private sector doing the same job..
 
 
 
I'd still prosper, the government wouldn't.......

 

No you wouldn't. Think about it for a minute.

No government built roads, no military, no police. No public safety, no property rights protection, no contract law enforcement. Anyone can just come up and steal anything from anyone and get away with it as long as the owner isn't watching.

In such a situation, we would have no industrial economy because there wouldn't be the kind of public peace and order needed for anyone to build a factory. Nobody would have a job because you can't create a company that employs people in a situation of chaos. It would be everyone for himself, people falling into gangs and preying on each other. You wouldn't even have money because that, too, is issued by the government. Trade would consist of barter only.

You wouldn't prosper in a situation like that. Nobody would except those who could command the biggest, meanest gangs. And even then, because there wouldn't be enough public order to support farming, either, the food supply would collapse and most people would starve to death.
 
 
 
 
 
Why don't they do it on their own? Buy the land on their own? Not have to rely on the government for eminent domain. Why don't they build the bridges and tunnels on their own?

They have no problem winning fat government contracts and getting the government to do all the dirty work so they can make a hefty profit

 

Gee, why wouldn't a private company build a state or federal highway on their own?....  

 

I think that's kind of our point. They wouldn't.

 

Right, but who pays the majority of the taxes for the roads currently DBS?

There will always be some form of government..... People aren't arguing against a sense of structure - they're arguing against this currant tyrannical structure...

Your "they build us roads" bullisht is just that - the federal government doesn't build roads - the state government does...

Our federal government is a useless oppressive tyrannical gang that does nothing more than ponder how they can create an Orwellian society....

Quite frankly I really don't give a shit what the state governments do because our Tenth Amendment creates competition amongst the states - so the states with the best policies will always be the most successful...

As it stands today the federal government rules over all of us and tells the states to pretty much fuck off if they don't agree with their policies.....

Anyway, did you fail to recognize i actually gave the gubment 15% of the credit in the OP?....  

 

No, in fact I quoted it. You pulled that figure out of your ass, and it's ridiculously low. Your success is totally dependent on government. You would have zero percent of it without government.
 
 
America was built upon government subsidies. A transcontinental railroad? Sure it was built by Chinese and Irish immigrants. But it was only possible due to huge land grants to the competing railroads.

Electrifying the Depression Era South? Could never have happened without the TVA. Las Vegas would STILL be a sleepy little desert town without the government funded Hoover Dam.

It's funny how the contemporary Conservative isn't Conservative at all. They're Anarchists!

They hate the politics of their opposition so much, they're perfectly willing to throw the entire American system of economic activity out with the bathwater.
 
 
 
How much of your success was because of Government?

 

At least 50% when taking all things into consideration. Government provided the environment and I did the rest.

Reasonably stated RW...

The rhetoric some on the left are putting out, including the President, that we should all basically bow down and let them confiscate more of what we earn is troublesome. They're treating this like a one way street and it certainly isn't.....
 
 
 
There will always be some form of government..... People aren't arguing against a sense of structure - they're arguing against this currant tyrannical structure...

 

The language that is being used is arguing against government generally, whether they realize it or not. If they don't, it needs to be pointed out.

 
the federal government doesn't build roads - the state government does...

 

State government is still government.

 
Our federal government is a useless oppressive tyrannical gang that does nothing more than ponder how they can create an Orwellian society....

 

Now that's an interesting thing to claim. Let's say we were to abolish, not government in general, but the federal government, leaving each state as an independent nation.

I believe that Hamilton, Jay, and Madison had something to say about the likely consequences of that:  Federalist Papers: FEDERALIST No. 6 

If we abolish only the federal government, leaving the state governments in place, we will not have quite the same level of disaster as if we abolish all government, but we will have a continent that is more or less constantly at war, and subject to being overrun by its neighbors, those neighbors being either stronger, more populous states, or Canada or Mexico.
 
 
None. Government over regulates my main business. And it was Republicans that passed all of the legislation.

My successes have been in working for government. Does that count?

 

Depends, do you think you would be successful without working for the government?

 

Who knows? If I had chosen college instead of joining the military, I'd likely have a very different life and there is no way of knowing if I would be as successful as I am now.
 
 
 
It looks like the President is now using the same rhetoric that the fully clothed Marxist Elizabeth Warren is using, "no one made it on their own, including Steve Jobs". I'm just curious to know on a percentage basis, how much did Government have to do with your success?

I'll be generous and say maybe 15% for me, what say you?

 

Elizabeth Warren is not a Marxist, nor is the president. I know you're smart enough to know this.

As for how much government was responsible for my success... Well, government built the roads and streets that I went to school on. I grew up in housing specifically protected for middle class people, so had a warm, safe, affordable home to live in while my dad was becoming successful. I went to public schools, had a regents scholarship, student loans guaranteed by the federal government so I could attend a state university...after which I went to a private law school and availed myself of those same federally guaranteed student loans.

...which enabled me to get the education that enabled me to have the profession I have now and the salary I make now...

And now my son goes to public school...his middle school was title I, so the resources were amazing...thereby enabling him to succeed and get into two of the best public high schools in the country

I should add that the same educational and living situation was true for my husband.

We benefit from health insurance from our jobs because of government regulations, and will have social security and pensions (g-d willing) when we're older

How do you quantify that?

Raising the tax rate on the middle class and the poor would shoot this economy right in the foot. It's DEMAND that creates jobs and economic growth. Taking away capital from the consumer base only leads to a stagnate economy.

And "punish" success? Were the successful really being punished by paying a 39% marginal tax rate?
 
 
 
 
How do you quantify that?

 

Sounds like you seriously lack self-sufficency and pride of independence.

it's amusing the way you folks toss the word independence around.
unless you can
grow your own food
build your own house
build and repair your own machines
do your own medical care
generate your own power
and the thousands of other things that make up true independence,you're pissing into the wind.

My husband and I have never accepted any entitlement. None, zero, zip. No unemployment; no students loans. I work for the govt. (teacher), but I earn that pay. (and then some). I also sent my own children to Catholic school and we are paying 100% of their college tuition.  

The only positive effect the government may have had in our business are tax credits for energy efficient appliances. We don't get that tax break; but our customers do. So I'd probably say about ".001 %".

You got loans, not handouts, private entities can do loans, not just the government. Your son is using resources that you are paying for and he wouldn't be getting into said schools without his own achieved merit. Any benefits employers are forced to offer is not necessarily a good thing and i'm sure it has something to do with the lousy unemployment rate. If you have the proper skill set and they want you, you can negotiate any damn thing you want without big daddy gubment. Don't let this rhetoric diminish what you and your family have accomoplished through your own hard work.......

It is not confiscation it is contribution. You contribute to the society you belong to. It is not a one way street. Returning to previous tax rates is not excessive. Especially since we have run up $14 trillion in debts since reverting to lower tax rates

 

Less spending and more people contributing would work wonders, but the demoralizer in chief thinks the only way to prosper is to punish success.

 

Raising the tax rate on the middle class and the poor would shoot this economy right in the foot. It's DEMAND that creates jobs and economic growth. Taking away capital from the consumer base only leads to a stagnate economy.

And "punish" success? Were the successful really being punished by paying a 39% marginal tax rate?

 

Yep, too damn high, period.........
 
 
 
My husband and I have never accepted any entitlement. None, zero, zip. No unemployment; no students loans. I work for the govt. (teacher), but I earn that pay. (and then some). I also sent my own children to Catholic school and we are paying 100% of their college tuition.

I'll be generous and say maybe 15% for me, what say you?

 

That's a hard question to answer. I have taken almost no hand outs at all. I collected unemployment twice in my life, For amounts I am sure is less than the Unemployment Insurance may employers paid in.

However We all benefit from the Basic system our Government put in place. American Capitalism has created a nation where even the poor live a standard of living that is the envy of most of the world. In a way our government, by not getting to involved and letting Capitalism work, made everyone's success possible.

That is why it is troubling to see so many people ready to turn their backs on that system. American Capitalism has flaws to be sure, but nothing else can create the wealth, and growth, that is needed to provide the Standard of living we all share. Every Step Toward More Socialism is a step away from what made us the Richest nation on earth.
 
 
 
 
 
They were paid for by taxes from the private sector, obviously. That changes nothing though. The private sector never would have provided me with all those opportunities. The government did.

 

Private entities can't build roads or give loans?, since when?

 

I'm not saying they can't. I'm saying they didn't.

 

the experience ny has had with private entities is that they overbill, overcharge, and spend too much time working on projects

and don't do nearly as well as government employees who aren't paid by the hour.

and no... private concerns can't do roads b/c GOVERNMENT would have to pay them.

I'll be generous and say maybe 15% for me, what say you?

 

Elizabeth Warren is not a Marxist, nor is the president. I know you're smart enough to know this.

As for how much government was responsible for my success... Well, government built the roads and streets that I went to school on. I grew up in housing specifically protected for middle class people, so had a warm, safe, affordable home to live in while my dad was becoming successful. I went to public schools, had a regents scholarship, student loans guaranteed by the federal government so I could attend a state university...after which I went to a private law school and availed myself of those same federally guaranteed student loans.

...which enabled me to get the education that enabled me to have the profession I have now and the salary I make now...

And now my son goes to public school...his middle school was title 1, so the resources were amazing...thereby enabling him tomsucceed and get into two of the best public high schools in the country

I should add that the same educational and living situation was true of my husband.

We benefit from health insurance from our jobs because of goby regulations, and will have social security and pensions (g-d willing) when we're older

How do you quantify that?

 

You got loans, not handouts, private entities can do loans, not just the government. Your son is using resources that you are paying for and he wouldn't be getting into said schools without his own achieved merit. Any benefits employers are forced to offer is not necessarily a good thing and i'm sure it has something to do with the lousy unemployment rate. If you have the proper skill set and they want you, you can negotiate any damn thing you want without big daddy gubment. Don't let this rhetoric diminish what you and your family have accomoplished through your own hard work.......

 

what we had were OPPORTUNITIES...opportunities that are being destroyed by randian policies...

i'm not big on hand-outs... i'm big on giving people a leg up. and the radical right hates anyone that gets or gives a leg up.

look at the loons on this board and the trash that spews from them... and ask yourself if those are people who believe we should all have education... and opportunities... and a government that provides those things.

yeah because asking them to Contribute just a little more to Their Pensions and Health care and still contribute less than Most Workers is "Sticking it to them"

no one else took my exams... no one else succeeded at my jobs.

i've managed to do quite well, thanks.

go figure.

Yep, too damn high, period.........

 

Are you interested in solving the deficit problem, or just coddling the wealthy? At 39%, we,had the Clinton economy. Entrepreneurism certainly didn't suffer. Unemployment was below 6%. Banks were lending, houses were being built and furnished. And the federal government was running a surplus.

Sounds pretty good from here.

But when that top marginal tax rate got cut from 39% to 36%, our federal deficit ballooned.

What is it the contemporary Conservative wants? A prosperous middle class or the consolidation of wealth among the very, very few? A robust and able consumer base, or lower standards of living by diminishing disposable income through a flat tax?

And how can a working class family in America today even think of signing on to more of what got us here? Trickle down has always been a canard. It's flood up, never trickle down.

No, being a useless tic doesn't count as "success" in any rational sense of the term.
 
 
I live in NJ, where property taxes are the highest in the nation. For $7000 a year, we get: police, schools, trash pickup, road maintenance, sewers, parks, etc. It's a lot of money, but it benefits our community directly.

We pay 10X that in income tax. I am not opposed to contributing our "fair share". But "fair" to me, suggests that EVERYONE contributes SOMETHING. That is simply not the case.

Don't you just love the spin doctors who imply that "Republicans hate bridges, clean water, and education"?

If clinton had not illegally changed the rules for being a member of the Navy, I'd have to say 50%. Since I was specifically working for the government.

but since they were changed, and I was illegally discharged;

10% I use my HS English and math often.
 
 
 
 
Well now lets see.

I grew up healthy thanks to Government's intervention in food and water and preventing companies from poisoning me (accidentally of course). I attended and graduated a public school (thanks taxpayers!) which allowed me to get into a University. I was able to pay that tuition through working and Pell Grants and guaranteed loans (thanks again taxpayers!). I then moved across the country (nice highways) and was able to start working in an industry I love.

Since then, it's been all me. But I think it's fair to say I would not be where I am today without our government.

 

Well let's see.

Did the governmet provide all those things out of the kindness of their hearts or were these things paid for by tax payers working in the private sector?

 

Moving the goalposts?

All of my primary education.

Half of my secondary education.

The roads and bridges used to get to and from every job interview, job and entrepreneurial endeavor.

Airport function and security for all of those flights for business, especially overseas.

Food safety so I can grab "whatever" for lunch and keep moving without fear of puking in the board room.

I could go on... Government is necessary for most of us to make our livings. Government is not the problem, government that is interested in little beyond re-election in a powerfully rich nation is.

the govt has allowed me to work my dream job. working for the space program. which BTW is a federally funded operation.

China, Russia and India all had launched this week, two were Russian. if we do not fund our space program and keep current tracking facilities at full operational status. we will lose the high ground in space. I don't think many Republicans even understand this fact. But its true. So ya, the govt has done good by me and its an honor to support the USAF, NASA and all other contractors involved.
 
 
Let's see....

Well after the Federal government helped my home town rebuild after Hurricane Diane's floods destroyed it, the local and state governments sent me thru-12 schooling that existed because my governments were protecting my society from anarchy and invasions, etc..

Then after my 4 years hitch in the NAV, where I enjoyed about $200,000 worth of additional education and training, I went to a unitersity I could never have afforded if it hadn't been for the GI bill.

Then I spend the next 30 years or so working outside of government in a society that existed becasue the government was there to insure that it wasn't overrun by criminals, and invading hordes of communists and so forth.

Then I got sick and after five years of that, I finally got some help from the Feds making is possible for myself and my family not to become homeless.

Today I still count on the VA for my health care. Not that I use it much (thank god!) but I know it's there if I need it.

I don't how to evaluate how much of my "success" is BECAUSE of the government, but I'm damned sure that if this nation hadn't had a government (or actually many different governments) my experience would have been significantly different.

Being a single mother in the 70-80s it worked for me. My three year old was in head start and got a head start. Now what? Help me to get a degree in Sociology and Special Education and sent my three children to college on my income. No scholarships or loans and now they are contributing to society. Now my social security and medicare is more then sufficient. Manage to save from my social security. Hard work and government play a big part. I have always lived within my means. Never had a credit card or debt. Paid cash of used cars. Shopped in thrift store and still do.

Why are so many ashamed to admit that the government actually does some good things?

 

I'm not. No one here that I can see is arguing for no government. They certainly do many things that make life easier and safer and allow us to pursue our desires as opposed to having to worry about other things. But we've all heard the phrase 'the buck stops here'. That's basically the way being successful works. No one, not even government, can make you successful. They can not make you good at whatever it is you do. At the end of the day it takes your choice and effort to be successful. Certainly government can foster an environment that has various opportunities. Whether said opportunities are taken advantage of and ultimately lead to some measure of success is still on you.
 
 
 
Why are so many ashamed to admit that the government actually does some good things?

Are you just another holier than thou wanna be socialist who thinks Barack Obama deserves more of successful taxpayers money because Barack Obama's teleprompter makes ridiculous claims regarding people not paying their "fair share" to the almighty government?.....

 

Barack doesn't keep the money, Einstein.

And as long as we're speaking in absolutes, no, Steve Jobs could not have amassed his fortunes in the absence of government. In fact the concept of 'HIS MONEY,' or any money for that matter, would not likely exist in any consistent form.

 

Despite the stellar government education you received, it seems you struggle to recognize the difference between literally speaking and figuratively speaking.

How many gubment programs were funded because of people like Steve Jobs? It's a chicken vs. egg debate, but i have a real problem with jokers like Elizabeth Warren and Obama pointing their condescending fingers at the very people that enable them to be in the position they're in. Folks like yourself are obviously ok with that. I'd bet Steve Jobs and many others like him pay more than their "fair share", whatever the hell that is......
 
 
 
Why are so many ashamed to admit that the government actually does some good things?

 

With the exception of pushing ideology at all costs,  
 
 
even big business, and farmers take governmental aid
 
 
 
It looks like the President is now using the same rhetoric that the fully clothed Marxist Elizabeth Warren is using, "no one made it on their own, including Steve Jobs". I'm just curious to know on a percentage basis, how much did Government have to do with your success?

I'll be generous and say maybe 15% for me, what say you?

 

I'd say all of it. Not necessary the present government or previous gvt officials....but due to the government of the United States of America, we are a country, like no other....with hard times and good times behind us and hard times and good times before us....I wouldn't choose to live anywhere else.....even with all of our faults....

And I have lived in others places, like Italy and Germany and Puerto Rico....so I believe I have a better idea of what I am talking about than most people....we have a pretty darn good country here and our gvt, as crappy as it can be....is a delight compared to the gvts in most other countries imo.

So, if it wasn't for :

We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure  domestic Tranquility , provide for the common  defence , promote the general  Welfare , and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our  Posterity , do  ordain  and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.

I probably would have never been as successful as I was, if it had not been for my Nation, and that means my government.

Well since the govt, since I started working, has been taking a percentage of all the money I make on the local, state, and federal level I think the govt has actually held me back.

Correct. Government is incapable of producing anything. They must rely on outside sources. Name something the government invented for the good/the benefit of the masses ?

-Well, I was born in a hospital that is tax-exempt (read: government support), For a time I attended public school (read: government support), I recieved fine traning and life skills courtesy of the US military (read:government support), I had part of of my higher education costs paid through student loans and vet benefits (read:government support).

Government services are mostly just that - Services. They could produce stuff but that's not the business they're in. But they're hardly incapable.

I didn't say I wanted no govt. No red herrings please. If there was an absense of government then your thread doesn't make sense.

You asked if the govt has helped me succeed and I said it had not helped me succeed as it has only taken away from what I have earned for myself.

Government is comprised of people.....people are those that invesnt things...produce things...start businesses....

The reason government can not start a business is government does not have its own capital.

But are they able to? As long as it is people with minds of reason, of course.

The point is, no business operates solely on their own without the support of our society (government)

Did you train your employees to read and write and mathematics?
How does product get into and out of your facility?
Who provides security and fire protection
Who protects you from unfair competition?
Who protects your patents or copyright?

Business profits significantly more from our taxes and have an obligation to pay for it

Back in WWII and up to the early 60s, the government had significant manufacturing capability. It was considered part of our National security infrastructure. Starting in the 60s, there was significant pressure to divest the government of it's ability to compete with industry.
Now it is primarily oversight of private contractors who provide goods and services
 
 
Has anyone on the right thought through how cutting federal spending would truly effect the economy? What impact on economic activity would result after the federal government stops spending on not only the entitlement programs, but all the other ancillary spending?

It's been established that the right does not consider the true impact on those receiving entitlement spending. Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, WIC, and HUD spending would severely impact those depending on such services. But at the very least, the Righties would stop having all those tax dollars confiscated from them unwillingly. That should make them so satisfied. Don't consider the poverty left in their wake, only the notion that they might save $.65 of every tax dollar unjustly confiscated by an uncaring and benevolent federal government.

Maybe, they can use that $.65 to off set the jump in gasoline prices oil companies charge during the peak summer driving season!

No sir, they sure don't. To the modern conservative, you pay your taxes and *POOF!* That money is gone forever, consumed by some three-headed scary ogre that they keep having their moms check under the bed for.

Oh, how they'll prattle on about lowering taxes to keep more money in the private sector and stimulate the economy, but are either unable to see or unwilling to concede that government spending has a higher stimulative effect than tax cuts for the wealthy every day of the week.

During that (prattling) on about lowering taxes to keep more money in the private sector and stimulate the economy, why don't they consider the vacuum effect Herman Cain's 9-9-9 plan would have?

If the wealthy and the corporations desperately need their money to provide jobs, and as the wealthy and corporations are currently sitting atop mountains of cash and yet failed to create jobs anywhere but Asia and Latin America, how would sucking tax dollars from the Middle Class via a 9% sales tax help the economy?

Consumer spending drives this economy. Taking disposable income from those least able to withstand it would cripple our prospects at economic growth like the polio virus crippled children in the twentieth century.

It looks like the President is now using the same rhetoric that the fully clothed Marxist Elizabeth Warren is using, "no one made it on their own, including Steve Jobs". I'm just curious to know on a percentage basis, how much did Government have to do with your success?

I'll be generous and say maybe 15% for me, what say you?

 

About 30%. Naval Aviation Technical schools gave me the training for my career. My military retirement check funds my retirement investments and I use low premium government subsidized health insurance.
 
 
Did the governmet provide all those things out of the kindness of their hearts...
-Well no. It's called the  Social Contract .

...or were these things paid for by tax payers working in the private sector?
-It seems to me it isn't a question of the government being "them" and you and me being "us." Some believe that when it get's right down to it, the government is an expression of our (your's and mine) collective priorities:
-Security;
-Health/Safety;
-Economic Opportunity;
-Transporation.

I think I am starting to figure out where you are coming from; at least we are in partial agreement :-)
 
 
How about enforcement of contracts?

How many of you would have a pot to piss in if some body wasn't enforcing contracts?

gvt, created our military, our police, our firemen, our roads and highways and train tracks....well, many of them, and our electric grid with huge subsidies, even building gas stations across our country was subsidized and our phone lines, our schools, our universities our libraries, the library of congress for goodness sake, our sewer systems, water resources !

you are completely viewing this through tunnel vision driveby, if you think our country's government contributed only 15% to your success....a tad self centered too, imho!

Let's see now. This is a bit difficult cause self pride and ego could hinder an honest appraisal. It would be nice to say I am a self made man, but who the hell is? First of all, what the hell did I have ot do with being here in the 1st place? Now, as a child I don't remember having a whole lot of power over my circumstances. Ok, then I became an adolescent in the 60's/70's and God knows where the hell I was. Then I joined the Army during Viet Nam. Saw too much and saw nothing. Took a few years to shake that all off and did some studying trying out a few girlfriends and generally listing her to there. At one point about 30 I began to think this life thing could get serious maybe I should pay attention. So I tried some honest effort and did some more studying. Went through a series of jobs doing well but less than satisfied with the paltry oppressive results. Did some more studying, went into computer sciences, lived though the dotcom boom farcical financial bullcrap. Hit the streets and leveraged my learned skills to survive till I could find more rewarding work. Yep, in that synopsis I could claim to be a "self made" man. Whatever that gives you. But there were plenty of transition periods where the government either gave me unemployment or further training that helped me to the next spot. So, IMO the gov't has its place. Wall Street and some company sure ain't gonna help you get to that next spot. Nope. once they use you up and suck every thing they think they can get out of you, it is all over with them.

My successes have been in working for government. Does that count?

 

And your inflated government salary TAKES from those who don't work for the government and hinders their ability to spend or invest which fucks this economy.

I don't know what is it you do (I'm sure nothing) but I'm certain a person with your job title in the private sector works 99% harder, is 99% more efficient (due to competition) but makes about 60% of what you make...

Then you have the fucking audacity to have a 99% avatar and talk about how the middle class is dying??

The same assholes that bailed out your labor union bailed out the banks and stuck the private sector with the bill...

Your taxes pay your own salary - hence you don't pay any taxes if you work for the government..

 

I see these useless government worker "fucks" every morning taking the commuter train to DC in the morning. They sleep/snore all the way up, arrive at their desks - do absolutely JACK SHIT for the economy all day except create red tape - log off, ride home, and call it a day.

Unproductive fucks.

 

you know what warrior this is the 2nd time you have said this,before i let it go,not this time.........i have carried mail for 30 fucking years and have a bad knee and lower back because of it.....when its fucking pouring like hell in a 40 degree wind i dont think im so fucking unproductive.....when its fucking Christmas time i dont think im unproductive......when Election mail comes out,i dont feel so unproductive....some govt workers work just as hard as any private enterprise guy.....every industry has "useless fucks" including whatever it is that you do for a living.....you just might be considered one by your fellow workers for all we know......dont judge every goddamned Govt worker on some people you see every fucking day on the train......thats something that the not to bright do here alot......i know your not one of them.....at least i think that......am i wrong?....
 
 
 
 
gvt, created our military, our police, our firemen, our roads and highways and train tracks....well, many of them, and our electric grid with huge subsidies, even building gas stations across our country was subsidized and our phone lines, our schools, our universities our libraries, the library of congress for goodness sake!

you are completely viewing this through tunnel vision driveby, if you think our country's government contributed only 15% to your success....a tad self centered too, imho!  

 

most of the success is due to being pushed out of the womb on or above US territory.

 

We have a GREAT country...and not just because I was born here...even my mother, who is foreign born but moved here after she married dad overseas, became a citizen when she was 19 or 20, would whip my butt if she heard me whining and pissing and moaning about this country and what "little" it has given to me, or given to me via opportunity, in the manner they are doing....shoot, it could be the GI belt even, from my Dad!  

We still are and have always been, "the land of opportunity"! and our Nation, with its governments and with its Constitution/Bill of Rights, is a major player in the game of success here!

and I am not saying this country is perfect, because it isn't! But most of us here, including the poor, have it better than most, in the rest of the world! That's just reality in my book!

Total bullshit. Fire Departments were all volunteer in the beginning. Many still are volunteer operations, and many are private. The do the job a lot cheaper than those lazy overpaid oafs in the govenrment run fire departments. Railroads are almost entirely private. The government subsidized railroads all went bankrupt. The electric grid is privately built. What "subsidies" do you imagine it received? Gas stations were subsidized? Since when? Phone lines were privately built. Schools, universities and libraries were all privately funded long before government got into the act.

Government simply isn't needed for most of the things you imagine it's needed for. It just takes over services after private firms or volunteer operations have been providing them for decades and the muscles them out of the way.

It looks like the President is now using the same rhetoric that the fully clothed Marxist Elizabeth Warren is using, "no one made it on their own, including Steve Jobs". I'm just curious to know on a percentage basis, how much did Government have to do with your success?

I'll be generous and say maybe 15% for me, what say you?

 

It was nice of him to throw Steve out there now that steve is no longer alive to tell him he is wrong about that.
 
 
 
Well now lets see.

I grew up healthy thanks to Government's intervention in food and water and preventing companies from poisoning me (accidentally of course). I attended and graduated a public school (thanks taxpayers!) which allowed me to get into a University. I was able to pay that tuition through working and Pell Grants and guaranteed loans (thanks again taxpayers!). I then moved across the country (nice highways) and was able to start working in an industry I love.

Since then, it's been all me. But I think it's fair to say I would not be where I am today without our government.

 

Makes you wonder how people survived in the early 1900's on up with all the water poisonings and having to pay for their own college.
 
 
 
The do the job a lot cheaper than those lazy overpaid oafs in the govenrment run fire departments.

 

yea those 5 firefighters who where in the building that collapsed on them getting some people out last month were lazy overpaid oafs......you know what Bri.....maybe you have a problem with how much these guys get paid,fine,but to call Firefighters overpaid lazy oafs,JUST BECAUSE,they work for the City or County instead of a private firm isnt to fucking smart on your part is it?....be pissed at what they might be getting paid,that's fine.....but to get pissed at a guy who took a job because he needed work and it just happened to be a govt job.....doesn't show much in the way of character....

While that is absolutely true, (I can say 'absolutely' because I'm simply reaffirming YOUR stated opinion of two politicians.) should your opinion of politicians in particular or in general really have that much affect on your overall view of the concept of 'government'?

I think you're tossing the proverbial baby out with the bath-water by railing against the concept of government in general. Government has a role and it involves spending money collected in forced taxes on common infrastructure, common defense and education of The People. The trick is to collect taxes fairly and spend it responsibly.

Instead of attacking 'government', what say we focus our attack on 'corruption'?

Government is REQUIRED to do the unprofitable things in life like education. Government is REQUIRED to build common infrastructure, ass-u-me-ing everyone would rather drop a few bucks into a fund for roads with their taxes instead of stopping at the edge of every private land owners property to pay a fucking toll.

The problem is not government. The problem is back stage private spending on political advertising, favoritism purchased with campaign money and outright corruption.

The water poisoned by industry was simply ignored in favor of the still pristine flow upstream. When the 'frontier' ends is when we rely on government to help us get along, share the resources given to ALL by God, and work toward something besides the next quarters profit statement.

Volunteer Fire department are fine in rural areas where you may be called out once a month to fight a brush or barn fire. Local communities still pay for their equipment and training. Professional firefighters are better. Ask NYC what they they think of their professional firefighters. Fighting a fire in a city is much more difficult than in a rural community. High rise buildings, chemical fires, much greater risk of loss of life.

Railroads were never private entities. They were built by Railroad tycoons who were handsomely paid with government land grants. When someone got in the way, they called the government to clear them out. Government subsidized railroads went bankrupt because they went through areas that were unprofitable...namely red states

Electric grids were privately built on one condition......perpetual monopoly protected by the government

gas stations were not subsidized....Roads were

Schools and universities were privately funded before the government got involved. What we had were universities that were only an option for richest Americans. Working Americans were lucky if their kids finished grammar school. It was Government universities and the GI Bill that made higher education available to the masses

Where did you get the idea that education is unprofitable? Government is not required to build infrastructure. Almost the entire railroad system was privately built.

The recipient is beginning to outweigh the tax payer, and to the left, this is music to their ears,Democrats are very charitable with other peoples money, the welfare system is proof.
 
 
How much of my success was because of the government?

Better question....could I have had success without a government?

I don't know. I don't live in Somalia.

No...I don't think the government helped me at all. I did it all on my own

 

and yet, many during the same time had crappy government funded schools; none or little access to medical research because of their circumstances, otherwise there wouldn't be a healthcare crisis; many had crisis with air, roads, bridges, ect., otherwise there wouldn't be a crisis now to be dealt with; there was Love Canal and wasn't it typical of how government didn't protect the people? There is no argument that many today to do not have safe communities; as for free commerce, when did we ever?

America was built upon government subsidies. A transcontinental railroad? Sure it was built by Chinese and Irish immigrants. But it was only possible due to huge land grants to the competing railroads.

Electrifying the Depression Era South? Could never have happened without the TVA. Las Vegas would STILL be a sleepy little desert town without the government funded Hoover Dam.

It's funny how the contemporary Conservative isn't Conservative at all. They're Anarchists!

They hate the politics of their opposition so much, they're perfectly willing to throw the entire American system of economic activity out with the bathwater.

Primary education of the people at large is not a for profit venture. It can't be. Profit can't be made unless those unable to pay for it are turned away.

I for one am thrilled that the rest of y'all saw fit to learn me some readin' writin' and cipherin' when I was an average middle-class kid in the 60's & 70's. It made going to university possible and gave me tools I still use to remain productive.

Most medical research is funded by the government. People did not live long because they had limited access to quality medical care, poor sanitation, dangerous jobs, no way to get to a hospital if they were injured. All were taken care of by the government, not private companies

Most families could not even afford to let their children attend High School because they needed them to work. Remember those pesky child labor laws.? Going to a private college was not achievable. State run universities made higher education affordable to the masses, so did the Government provided GI Bill

Government pays for much of the groundbreaking R&D in medicine, communications, aircraft and energy. They also set standards for job safety, water and air quality, automotive safety and medical care that saves millions of lives
 
 
 
It looks like the President is now using the same rhetoric that the fully clothed Marxist Elizabeth Warren is using, "no one made it on their own, including Steve Jobs". I'm just curious to know on a percentage basis, how much did Government have to do with your success?

I'll be generous and say maybe 15% for me, what say you?

 

Probably lots. GI Bill helped pay for college, my degrees from public universities (CAL -undergrad) San Francisco St. U (Grad) allowed me to advance from line staff to senior management and retired at age 56.
 
 
 
 
 
Well, the gov did keep me from an early grave. 25 yrs ago I did a drug trial at the VA that probably saved my life.

So, there's that.

 

Drug trials are arranged by drug companies, not the government.

 

At the VA, which is the government.

 

A drug company produced the drug and paid all expenses for the trial. The location is immaterial. And what is snjmom doing at the VA?
 
 
As an Over the road truck driver I have to give the Federal government it's due. We are one of the very few industries the the government actually has Constitutional authority to legislate. They provide many of the roads I run on and prevent local governments from preventing me from doing my job. In that way they have helped me to be successful at what I do. But even if they did not do this, I would still get the job done.

Some things that the government does not do for me:
1. I do not get a minimum hourly wage. I make money only when rolling down the road.
2. The government does not class me as either skilled or unskilled labor and goes out of its way to avoid calling me a professional.
3. OSHA Applies to me only when at a shipper or reciever.
4. Does not require air conditioning when the temp is 105. Just heaters for when it is cold.
5. They do not require training for people with class d licenses. Ie. Light passanger cars and light pickup trucks. They tend to be under state law, and states tend to consider driving a right.

In short while the government has made my job easier in some ways., it did not make my job possible and we have been delivering the things you take forgranted since before the feds decided to regulate us and before most states were even states, let alone territories.

The tech may change but the job never has, and is not likely to no matter what harebrain reg the DOT cooks up for us to obey next.

Most medical research is funded by the government.

 

That's actually 100% wrong. Most mecial research is funded by private companies. Take MRI and CAT scan machines. Does the government build these? Artificial hips and knees? Drugs? The list is endless. Since WW II, government has been trying to horn in on the business, but it still hasn't made that much of an inroad.

 
People did not live long because they had limited access to quality medical care,

 

ROFL! Yeah, right, like antibiotics, vaccines, anesthetics, new surgical procedures, life saving drugs too numerous to count. Private industry created "quality medical care."

 
poor sanitation

 

You're truly ignorant if you think private companies can't provide water and sewage services. My parent's house was supplied by a private water company.

 
dangerous jobs,

 

Government regulations did not eliminate dangerous jobs.

 
no way to get to a hospital if they were injured.

 

I don't recall where the government invented the motor car and hence the ambulance.

 
All were taken care of by the government, not private companies

 

Total 100% bullshit.

 
Most families could not even afford to let their children attend High School because they needed them to work. Remember those pesky child labor laws.? Going to a private college was not achievable. State run universities made higher education affordable to the masses, so did the Government provided GI Bill

 

All mass education has done is decrease the value of an education. Previously, people learned on the job. They were trained by their employer. Cost to the taxpayers? $0.00. In the past you could become an engineer without ever going to college. Now you have to have a college diploma to be a firemen. What have we gained?

Really? What "ground breaking R&D has government paid for?
 
 
BRIPAT,

Can you not concede the necessity of government at all? You seem to think that any and all improvements to people's lives can never be made by government action. Well. there have been sterling examples of government projects and programs that have improved the quality of the lives of our citizens.

Even the most fervent of contemporary Conservatives can recognize the benefits of government projects and programs. Only Anarchists feel that any and all government is either inherently evil and tyrannical or hopelessly incompetent and corrupt.

Perhaps you are not a Conservative but an Anarchist.
 
 
 
Why are so many ashamed to admit that the government actually does some good things?

 

because it would kill their temporary government is bad buzz,

You're joking RIGHT---       How much of my success is attributed to Government--I would be a lot more successful--if government would just get the hell out of the way.

 

You need to move to Somalia where there won't be any gov't at all to get in your way, or anyone else's way, for that matter. Everybody there is pretty much free to do whatever the hell they want.

Don't forget to write. But don't be surprised if you can't find anywhere to mail the letter.

2.5 trillion in one year, 2006, was spent by State govts on R& D.

Much of medical research and development is done by our universities, on federal gvt grants.

Having worked over 30 years in R&D, I can tell you today's private sector is very frugal when it comes to funding R&D. R&D does nothing for today's bottom line and investors want return on investment.....NOW

It is the government funding grants in medical, energy, communications, agriculture and hundreds of other industries. Once advances in technology are made......then the private sector swoops in to reap the profit
 
 
I worked on GPS for the military in the late eighties. A lot of money spent on launching satellites, trial and error, testing and ensuring a reliable network. It was initially intended to be a military system only

Ultimately, access was turned over to the private sector and they made a fortune off of it
