The telecom regulator on Monday approved 3G License bidding by three top mobile
phone operators.

Advanced Info Service PLC or AIS, Total Access Communication Public Company
Limited or DTAC and TrueMove, all of which are 2G license holders have been
given the green light to participate in the 3G license bidding by the National
Telecommunication Commission (NTC).

The NTC said that the three mobile service companies were eligible to bid in the
first round of the third-generation mobile- phone technology license auction
which will take place on 20 September in central province of Prachuap Khiri
Khan.

The bidding will be broadcast live on television, the National News Bureau of
Thailand or NNT said.

The NTC is planning to accept tenders from other interested bidders and hold the
second round of the 3G license auction in the next few months after the first
lot has been sold off, the NNT said.
