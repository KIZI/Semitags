United States-led Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) freed a German-owned container
ship early Thursday after a face-off with Somali pirates, about 85 miles South
East of Yemen in the Gulf of Aden.

The U.S. Marines from the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit's Maritime Raid Force
(MRF) aboard USS Dubuque (LPD 8) operating under Combined Task Force 151
(CTF-151) boarded and seized control of Antigua-Barbuda-flagged, M/V Magellan
Star from pirates who attacked and boarded the vessel early Wednesday.

The Bahrain-based CMF said in a statement that its successful mission secured
the safety of the ship's crew and returned control of the ship to the civilian
mariners.    "Nine pirates are currently under control of CTF 151, pending
further disposition. This ship's crew has not reported any injuries or
casualties.  There were no reported injuries from the U.S. Maritime Raid Force,"
CMF said in the statement.

"We have full support of the international community and will continue to do
everything possible to bring security to the Gulf of Aden and Somali Basin."
