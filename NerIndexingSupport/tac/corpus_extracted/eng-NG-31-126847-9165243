Bush's ill planned, unnecessary war rages on. Iraq is too dangerous a
post for the families of diplomats. Enough Americans volunteered to
risk their safety & serve in the hell Bush created to avoid forcing
some to go, but families stay home, filled with fear. Contrast Bush &
Cheney during Vietnam:

"I had OTHER PRIORITIES": Cheney
"I decided to BETTER MYSELF": Baby Bush

Thank God real Americans are sacrificing in the idiot boy's posing
playground that became a nightmare.
