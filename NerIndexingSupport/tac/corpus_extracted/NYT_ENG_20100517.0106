Old photos a wrinkle in beauty queen's win

As Metro Detroit rejoices, stripper contest casts pall for Rima

The Detroit News

More than 24 hours after Miss Michigan USA Rima Fakih was named
Miss USA 2010, many in Metro Detroit continue to rejoice.

"I feel really good about it because she's from Michigan, and
especially from Dearborn," says Ollie Hajaij, owner of Ollie's
Lebanese Cuisine on Ford Road in Dearborn, who was among those who
watched the 24-year-old take the crown.

However, whenever there's 15 minutes of fame, there's some
controversy lurking. Photos of Fakih posed provocatively in a
T-shirt and short red shorts from a women-only 2007 stripper class
and radio station contest hit the Internet shortly after she won
the national title -- leaving some in the community saddened.

"When she pursued her dream, her passion to become a part of
this beauty pageant, it's the American dream," says Imad Hamad,
director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee. "I
don't know why people have to go and try to find anything simply to
tarnish that happiness."

The photos, from a Mojo in the Morning Stripper 101 contest,
have been posted on the 95.5 site for three years, Mojo said in an
e-mail released to the media.

The radio show put them more prominently on their site with a
caption congratulating Fakih. In an interview Monday, Mojo said the
classes and contests are for women only, held in the morning at a
local club while it was closed.

"This doesn't speak of her (Fakih's) character because her
character is strong," Mojo says. "She is really a good person."

The Miss Universe Organization president Paula Shugart had
little to say about the photos to The Detroit News. The Miss
Universe Organization is the parent company of the Miss USA and
Miss Teen USA pageants.

"Rima is on a plane to New York," Shugart said in a telephone
interview. "I haven't had a chance to speak to her so I have no
comment on the issue at this time."

Meanwhile, multiple Arab-American institutions issued press
releases Monday congratulating and saluting Fakih. In a statement
from the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee in Washington,
D.C., ADC president Sara Najjar-Wilson called Fakih "a very
intelligent as well as a very beautiful young woman."

"We are very proud of Rima Fakih," Najjar-Wilson said in the
statement. "We are elated by her success, and are confident that
she will honor all Americans in representing the United States in
the Miss Universe Pageant."

In its release, Dearborn's Arab American National Museum and its
parent organization, the Arab Community Center for Economic and
Social Services (ACCESS), touted Fakih's volunteer work in the
nonprofit's Social Services Department. She guided clients in
negotiating government assistance programs.

"Rima was so very helpful. Clients simply loved her," says
Brigitte Fawaz-Anouti, director of ACCESS Social Services
Department -- Main Office & Special Projects. "She was so
sympathetic, especially with older clients, and exhibited such
kindness, compassion and patience in delivering services. Rima was
one of my best."

In addition to winning both the Miss Michigan USA and Miss USA,
Fakih won the Miss Lebanon Emigrant in 2008. While it has been
widely reported that Fakih, who is Lebanese-American, is the first
Miss USA of Arab-American decent, she is actually the second. Miss
California USA Julie Hayek, who is also Lebanese-American, was the
first in 1983.

However, according to ACCESS's press release, Fakih is thought
to be the first Muslim to hold the title.

Fakih has said in the past that her family observes both Muslim
and Christian traditions, says Kim Silarski of ACCESS .

In an interview with Time.com in March, Fakih says she graduated
from St. John's High School in New York. A resident of Dearborn
since 2003, she earned a bachelor's degree in economics from the
University of Michigan of Dearborn.

Those thrilled about Fakih's win go beyond the Arab-American
community. Beulah Cooley, a Detroit fashion designer whose works
Fakih modeled a few years back, exclaimed with delight about the
win.

"Oh my God! I didn't recognize her!" she says. "I kept saying
she looked so familiar -- I thought it was great.

"She was the only one who really showed the wrap that was on
the swimsuit," Cooley said, noting that she had the same reaction
as Joan Rivers. "She worked that cape!"

Spike of the Mojo show said participants of the Stripper 101
contest had to sign a release to gain entrance, and that signs are
posted on the club entrance letting all participants know that
photos will be taken for use on the website.

"These photos have been on our website for three years since
the event. Rima (Fakih) has never called to express concern about
the photos nor should she since she's wearing more in our photos
than her photos on Miss USA's website," says Spike.

There was a public outcry over this year's Miss USA pageant
photos, which many thought were too racy. All 51 Miss USA
contestants posed for official black and white photos, wearing high
heels, garters, lingerie, fishnet stockings and showing plenty of
skin. The photos were reportedly taken by renowned fashion
photographer Fadil Berisha and can be seen at
www.missuniverse.com/missusa/members/contestants.

Hamad, director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination
Committee says he is confident that Fakih will prevail through the
photo controversy, but he is saddened by it.

"Making money and fame from something old, it is cheap," Hamad
said.

As far as residents of Dearborn, Fakih's victory is still a
source of pride.

"I know her personally because she's been in my restaurant many
times. I've sat and talked with her. She's a beautiful girl," said
Hajaij, owner of Ollie's Lebanese Cuisine.

When asked about the Mojo in the Morning Stripper 101 contest
Hajaij says, "I have no idea about this."

Ghassan Khaled, head of Royal Grill Restaurant in Dearborn,
said: "We're so proud of her. Any human being can make a mistake.

"We all do crazy stuff when we're you're young and later regret
it."

He predicted she will become Miss Universe.
