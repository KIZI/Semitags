Ok, yes he's not a youngster.  Yes he's never play regularly.  Yes the
best role he's ever played was platoon.

But I think if the Mets should decide to not resign Lo Duca and can't
find any other great catcher in the free agent market, they should
give Castro a chance to play regularly to see what he can do.

I think Castro has done a great job for the Mets.  He can't run, but
he out hits Lo Duca, and is pretty good defensively.

You mean spend 50 games on the DL instead of 25?

I believe he is doing the job he is good at. He's a good back up
catcher. When he was with the Marlins they gave him the everyday job
and he just fell flat on his face. He stopped hitting.

Castro = Chavez.  Both great bench players, not so great full time
players.  They are better off find a catcher that will catch 120-130
games and give the rest of the games to Castro.

If Lo Duca is willing to take less money, he might be the best option
out there.  Here is a list of hte 2008 free agent catchers.  Let's
just say it's not the best most impressive list i've seen.

Brad Ausmus (39)
Michael Barrett (31)
Ramon Castro (32)
Jason Kendall (34)
Paul Lo Duca (36)
Jorge Posada (36)
Jose Molina (33)
Ivan Rodriguez (36) - $13MM club option for '08
Yorvit Torrealba (30)

Hmm . . . a 36 year old bad defensive catcher who can't hit and will
probably want to make a lot of money . . . no . . .

I think if they can resign Castro and explore the trade market . . .
that's probably the best solution at this point.  Getting stuck with
Lo Duca some more isn't a good idea.

I invite everyone to review Castro's AAA numbers.  Granted, it was years ago
and PCL numbers can be inflated, but he put back-to-back seasons with OPS
numbers over 1.000.  I have to think that a .628 SLG in the PCL will
translate into something around .450 in the bigs.  And, if Castro can slug
.450 in the bigs, he'd likely be a prime candidate for 2008.

I'm with you.  The thing that worries me is his durability.  I think
some kind of a platoon would work best where maybe Castro plays 65% of
the time and somebody else plays 35%.  I'd hate to just sign a classic
'defensive backup catcher' and think Castro is going to catch 140
games.  I don't see that happening.  But in no way shape or form do I
think resigning Paul Lo Duca is a good idea.

That's nonsense.  Castro can hit and Chavez can't.
