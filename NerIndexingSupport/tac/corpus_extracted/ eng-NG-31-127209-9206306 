And moving forward.  The NYY were in a huge hole after the first
month, and now they are playing the "best" baseball in the majors
and have to be favoured, yet again, for the rings.  The Bosox will
qualify as the wildcard and hopefully will meet the NYY in the
playoffs. This year the NYY will bury them.

Who will be the MVP?  It could be Posada.  It could be ARod.  It
might even be Derek Jeter.

In other good news,  Billy Beane's erstwhile "contenders" are
fighting it out with Texas for last place in the AL West.  Good for
them.  The Beanes have finally bottomed out after an improbable
regular season run over the last few years.  Of course the Beanes
did nothing in the playoffs and so, perhaps, we can finally lay the
old "Moneyball" myth to rest.

cordially, as always,
