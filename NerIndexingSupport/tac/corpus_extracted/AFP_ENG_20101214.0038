Japanese free agent designated hitter Hideki Matsui passed his physical and
finalized a one-year deal with the Oakland athletics, the team said Tuesday.

The A's and Matsui had agreed to terms at the weekend, and Oakland planned a
Tuesday press conference to officially introduce their new DH.

Matsui brings a reliable bat to the middle of Athletics' order.

The 36-year-old batted .274 with 21 home runs and 84 RBIs last season with the
Los Angeles Angels, the Athletics' AL West division rivals.

Matsui spent his first seven major league seasons with the New York Yankees,
earning Most Valuabe Player honors in the 2009 World Series.
