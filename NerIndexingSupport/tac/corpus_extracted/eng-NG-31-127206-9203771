I don't consider myself a troll. I started doing this RIBBING stuff
when I saw OFP and the Chuck guy
coming over and terrorizing my Yankees NG.The truth is,they're just
plain good at it and I'd rather
talk sports in a civil matter for now on.Doesn't mean I won't have
some harsh things to say from
time to time :) I think this has been spurred on by the fact that I am
happy to see the Boston
Celtics doing well after such a long drought.Also, I think I've made a
few Boston friends mad
that I didn't realize they knew about the NG.How gullible(sp?) is
that?
