An international philatelic exhibition opened on Friday at the FIL Exhibition
Centre in Lisbon as part of a series of events to celebrate the 100th
anniversary of the founding of the republic.

Cavaco Silva, president of the Portuguese Republic, attended the opening
ceremony and visited the exhibition with keen interest.

More than one million stamps will be on display. They are from philatelic
associations, postal operators and traders from 77 countries, some of which so
valuable that the security will be strengthened during the days of the
exposition.

During the exhibition, there are many activities to be held to public, such as
producing stamps with your own picture and taking home, or using them to send
correspondence.

The event, which will last 10 days until Oct,10, is the largest philatelic
exhibition in Portugal and expects to attract 150 thousands visitors.
