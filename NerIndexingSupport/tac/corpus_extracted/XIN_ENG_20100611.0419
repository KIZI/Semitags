The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) said
Friday, with immediate effect, HKSAR passport holders visiting Myanmar would be
issued a tourist visa for a stay of up to 28 days on arrival at the
international airports in Yangon and Mandalay.

The announcement came after the government received formal notification from the
Consulate General of the Union of Myanmar in Hong Kong.

"We welcome this notification by the local Consulate General of the Union of
Myanmar," a government spokesman said.

At present, 140 countries/territories have granted visa-free access or visa-on-
arrival to HKSAR passport holders.
