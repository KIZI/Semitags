I don't know what you feel about gay people so please tell me. Personally I don't think it's wrong...I mean, supposedly love has no boundries right? But if you do think it's wrong I just wanna have some idea why you may think that.
 
 
Basically this book I found says it was written by the almighty creator and it says that gays are evil because God doesn't like them even though he created them and so I now must spend my life hating other people for no other reason than base prejudice and lies.
 
 
It's cool and that. Doesn't affect myself and harms no one although I just found out today my Aunt is a lesbian. ( She was previously married and has 4 kids.)

yea, i hate that about the bible...tbh i think that god doesn't mind gay people, it was probably some homophobe at the time that added it in, after all he said we were supposed to love each other, love has no boundries...when you think about it, 30 years ago people would have been hanged for being gay, but like 200 years before that in Roman times being gay was perfectly normal...

....
well, not too sure what to say to that  
well that is kind of a shock, but maybe she only just realised it...of course its gonna be hard though
sorry to hear that
 
 
No of course not. It's just love and love isn't wrong
 
 
I love gay people- i'm straight though- but i don't like the act it just seems so gross it makes me want to barf. It has something to do with the fact that where i grew up people are all heterosexual and also i am Christian. I feel sorry for gay people though because i think it's because the society accepts it that more people are being gay. Where I come from in Africa, hardly anyone knew about homosexuality until we became westernised and people started thinking it's ok to be gay and now more people where i come from are becoming gay. Naturally, heterosexuality is the norm but westernisation has changed things and the flexibility of our society makes these changes acceptable...so there's really nothing to do about it but to let people live in peace with their decisions.  
 
 
I hear Buju Banton is fairly passionate about this debate
 
 
I'm gay, so it would be weird if I thought it was wrong  .
 
 
you know what, with all honesty i don't give a ****  
 
 
It is wrong. Next question?

hahahaha...taty, you're a legend...oh btw, what plans do we have for valencia??    
 
 
No, it is not. Although my parents say they wouldn't mind, I can tell that they would be unhappy if I were.
 
 
Some of my best friends are gay and I think it's totally normal.
 
 
It isn't wrong but if I have a gay son in the future that is overly camp I would be very disappointed.

Err, people don't 'become' gay. It's just that more people are open about it because there's less stigma against it... They were gay all along, honestly.

What is it about homosexuality that makes people so enraged/disgusted?  
 
 
Noo, it's not wrong! My version of Christianity says that whatever your sexual orientation it's all good as long as you're a lovely person on the inside. I don't really agree with this whole concept of a 'picky God' who sends perfectly nice people to hell just because they did something uncontrollable and fell in love. That's jacked up.

It's not a decision and people don't become gay. I'm African too and your view seems to be common amonst Africans (/generalisation). Homosexuality isnt a western thing, it has been around for centuries. People are just slowly realising that people are people. I've never understood how people can believe homosexuality is a choice. What do you mean by the 'act' making you sick? With all due respect, it has nothing to do with anyone but that person and their partner. I don't see a hetro couple walking down the street and think about their sex lives. It's none of my business.

Love is love in my opinion. There isn't enough in the world as it is, so why discriminate? There's this musical called 'Zanna, Don't' where almost everyone is gay and hetrophobia exists. Check my sig and you'll see my favourite fictional couple are gay. I used to be the person who was like 'I don't care if people are gay, I just really don't want to see it' and thought that was acceptable. It's not.

I dont really think its wrong at all! I just dont personally like it :/ None of my mates like it so I guess they have dragged me to their side! D: If my mate was gay I wouldnt mind
 
 
i don't think it is wrong but i don't think they should be allowed to adopt
 
 
Well im bisexual but with a heavy male preference, so borderline gay i suppose but OP was really asking what people who are against gays think, not what you personally think. but um a lot of it is religious based and brought on by fear of propaganda, such as homosexuals having STD's and such and in my personal opinion its just people who are closed minded or ignorant of others. Either they cannot understand the full situation of they are not willing too due to irrational ideas, usually caused by religion.
 
 
People who think its wrong to be gay make me sick
 
 
I'm gay. (Well, lesbian.)
I'm exactly the same as any other girl, I just happen to fancy women.
I can't understand what's so wrong about that.

You know what, this is how i see it: when i see something i want but i don't have money, i wish i could just take it; but that's stealing, if there is less stigma against theft and society accepts it in the future for some strange reason; does that make it morally okay ?

I don't dislike the people, i have gay friends, one of my favourite photographers is Seanen Middleton, he's gay but that doesn't make me hate his work; people have made decisions that are none of my business but that doesn't mean i don't have an opinion on what they do. And what i mean by the act making me sick is how it is portrayed in media but i am not comfortable with. I just think the act is unnatural and wrong and i won't be convinced otherwise but i won't treat homosexuals any different from heterosexuals.

But stealing things is seen as morally wrong because it causes harm to the person who you have stolen something from. If you steal £20 from a person, that person has no longer got that £20, which will upset them. However, if a man falls in love with another man, there is no loss of anything. The only hurt that could occur would be that of any relationship, where they may break up or have arguments etc.

People are more accepting of homosexuality because they realise the flawed logic behind persecuting a person for something they can't help. Let me give you an example. Personally, I like strawberries, but I don't like cauliflower, and say these were the only two food options I had. Now, the girls are allowed strawberries, but I am not. I ask why, and they say 'Because I'm a boy, so I should like cauliflower'. So I am being denied what I want (strawberries) and being told I should like what I don't (cauliflower). No matter how much you give me cauliflower, I will not like it, and will always prefer strawberries. Now, if attitudes changed and I was allowed to eat strawberries, then I would, because I liked them all along. The only thing preventing me from having strawberries was the fact that I wasn't allowed to have them.

Do you see?

Do you see?

 

If you're not allowed strawberries, why would you like strawberries? You shouldn't know how it tastes. If it's not allowed, it shouldn't have been tried but being human makes people experiment, hence, waking up dormant senses. In this case: senses that make me very uncomfortable and which i think is wrong. I still don't see it, people should realise that things are that way cos that's how they're meant to be.

It's only a vague analogy. It's obvious that there's a stark difference between liking a type of food & liking a person. At the end of the day, what I'm saying is if you force-fed me something I hated & barred me from what I liked, I won't begin to like what you feed me or begin to dislike what you take away. In that same way, I won't begin to dislike men in a romantic way because you tell me not to, or begin to like women in a romantic way because you tell me I should. No-one can choose who they're attracted to.
 
 
I thought it was wrong based on what people told me. Until i met someone gay in real life and realised they are still human, and it NOT how its shown on the telly. Half the time you wouldn't even notice.
 
 
...no, it is not really wrong to be gay.

I can't understand what's so wrong about that.
