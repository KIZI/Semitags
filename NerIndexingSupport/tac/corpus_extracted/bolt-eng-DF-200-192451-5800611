China or India, which do you think will be the next to balance out the economic prowess or even take a lead with the United Sates, in the next ten years !!!

Next 10 years? Neither. California and New York will have continue to have a higher combined GDP than China and India.

 Interesting chart

Then what is the need for this?

Cannot the US policy makers do something about it, maybe ask manufacturers to set up shop in US states and not in China.

*The manufacturing sector has lost 3 million jobs over the last five years, including 81,000 jobs in 2005, as the manufacturing trade deficit has continued to expand.

Amazing, America lost low-paying jobs to China, which were in turn replaced by higher paying jobs, all while salaries in the US remain 20 times higher than in China.

how and why do you state this,

and the following are examples which conflict with your statement above..

There are exceptions, but the vast, vast majority of jobs that have gone to China are of the low paying, unskilled variety.

Also, plenty of work has been "insourced", such as the 4,300-worker BMW factory in Greer, S.C.
 
 
in he next ten years no chance not without something huge happening like a gold rush

but in the long term id say china
 
 
In the next ten years, I don't think that either of them have a chance as being the chief rival to the US, but in a report I read somewhere (perhaps in an older issue of New Scientist), it predicted that by 2050, China will have the world's biggest economy and output followed by India, and then the US. I'll see if I can find a link to the report later.

Only if you assume that China's and India's growth rates can continue at the current pace for the next 45 years, which is an incredibly dubious assumption to make. And even at current growth rates, India wouldn't catch up to the US by 2050.
 
 
If chinas economy continues to grow at the same rate(which not even china wants!!) then in 50 years time it will outscore the USA.

If my brother continues to grow at the same rate, in 50 years time he will be taller than... oh, you get the picture.
 
 
I thought economists had predicted 2020 as when China and the US economies would be about equal size?

Surely as the economy grows in size, growth rate would decrease by itself as it would simply be impossible to sustain?

Why would China not want that?

sorry forgot to answer the question: I think China will be the biggest rival.
 
 
Out of the two? China without a shadow of a doubt. The only thing, in my view, that could prevent this is if they try and be America.

Without a doubt? You think it's actually likely that China will sustain a 9% growth rate for another 45 years? Someone has never studied economics...

As for why China doesn't want a growth rate this high, it's because it's likely to spark off inflation at some point, and the growth is not efficient, in that an immense amount of capital is needed to sustain it, and that capital is not being used productively.

Hmm and someone is unable to read properly. The guy stated that out of the two countries he thinks China will be without a doubt the main rival to the United States, that is in his opinion it will be a greater rival than India. Nothing to do with the sustainability of China's growth rate or in fact anything else. Stop looking for arguments which aren't being made and are convenient for what you want to say.

wait a minute - these models are not based on the simple assumption that they will grow at the same rates - dont be naiive. They are based on much more complicated models and yes they obviously make assumptions. But the liklihood is that china and india have a very good chance of overtaking the US, in terms of figures such as GDP. The major problem in these countries is inequality but the middle class is growing at a massive rate. The fact is that the US have very little room for growth while China and India still have vast amounts of resources available to them which they have not yet fully exploited.

Err, they do actually. The only way China can catch up to the US in 45 years is if the US maintains a 3.5% growth rate and China maintains a 9% growth rate.

Read his next sentence. Clearly he thinks it's likely that China will surpass the US unless the US does something against it.
 
 
God - it's always amazing the number of people with no grasp of economics who jump on the "wow China" bandwagon...

Long - long term... China could well be the biggest economic power in the world... but 10 years??? 20? 30? 40? even 50? Na... no way... no country in the HISTORY of the modern world has had that sort of sustained growth... Hell, even the Chinese state is worried about overheating.

Just wait and see how many problems China has to deal with as they grow, and as democracy takes hold...

With growth comes complication... little of which China has had to address so far...

Oh really   Surely what he is saying here following on from his previous sentence is that out of China and India, China will be the main rival to the US. The only thing in his opinion that could preclude this is if China adopts an American model or attempts to transform itself into an American clone. Again at no point was an economic argument being provided nor does he suggest that China will surpass the US unless the US does something against it.

Well considering the OP asked:

which will surpass and/or balance the US - India or China in the next (10 or so) years... the answers could have been

a) China
b) India
c) Neither

The poster replied with "of the two - definitely China". I think an assumption that he/she meant China would overtake/balance the US's economy within that period is in no way absurd.
 
 
India's too corrupt for it to allow itself to become an economic power....

Lol...oh, I could only comment on India as that was the only one I had knowledge on !! I believe corruption is stopping these countries reaching their full potential, and these claims of reaching equal or surpassing US's power in say 40 years time would be come possible...But with the state they are in now, no way....

Very very true... corruption is a MAJOR constrain on economic growth...

However, India also has a problem - it is a democracy.

In the next ten years? Neither. Try 100.
 
 
And even forgetting the economics of maintaining a 9% growth rate, does everyone really think that China's economy won't be impacted by attempts to remove the Communist Party from power (and those attempts are inevitable) or by attempts at various parts of the country to secede (which are also inevitable as the Chinese government will be forced to allow more dissent if it wants to maintain strong economic growth)?

Of course given China's political system, it can outspend the US on defense even if it's GDP is half the size of America's, and that's the main thing that concerns the US.
 
 
As I said... democracy CAN = economic trouble...

If you can simply issue dictats you can crush any movement that would aim to increase say, workers rights, or increase taxes...

Wait until China has to deal with the 1st world problems... not to mention its population imbalance.

Although I suppose it helps not to have much of a pension system in the first place...

In the end China will (hopefully) begin to address the welfare of its people as a whole... which will mean better public services, welfare of some sort, and greater safety standards and the like...

That will cut growth nicely.

The irony of a "communist" regime showing the potential of "unbridled capitalism" on economic growth. Then again, everyone knows that benevolent dictatorship is the best form of government in terms of efficiency, but everyone also knows that no dictatorship stays benevolent for long.

Well I've yet to hear of one being benevolent at all... I certainly wouldn't call China Benevolent...

Paternalistic... sure... but the sort of father that makes you practice your piano, maths, french and or violin 8 hours a day, beats you for answering back, and censors MTV and the National Geographic Channel from your room...

Oh... and who buys lots of guns for the house.

By benevolent I mean working for the benefit of the people (though in this case, the government is working for the benefit of the people as that's the only way it can stay in power). Right now the regime thinks that pursuing rapid economic growth is in its interest. At some point it will realize that pursuing such growth will be a major obstacle to its survival. Or we could see a "counter-revolution" by whichever revolutionaries still exist in China as a result of the growing gap in wealth and income, which won't bode well for China's economic potential. Only Singapore managed to develop economically without ousting the dictatorship.
 
 
If China carries on with it's reforms then I would say they are the main competitor. However if they cannot take on democracy and fully extend property rights to all areas of it's economy then India will overtake them. Investors are already paying a mounting risk premium due to perceptions of instability. There is always the risk that the government may intervene and sieze assets. Even the mere word communism asserts downward pressure on investment valuations.

India is significantly more liberalised. Trade and movement of labour and capital is freer. There is less risk associated with India. India's potential is comparable to China but only restricted because there is less of it. Less people, less land and less resources.

Taking the long view I personally favour India as it is more compatable with the west. Communism takes a long time to recover from. The structure may change but it's people will still be the same. Those millions of indoctrinated children will be that way their entire lives.
 
 
I agree, neither but in the long term, I predict that China would be military rival whereas india would be a more economic rival.

That's not really true...

India has many things going for it... English, better legal system...

However what DOES drag it down is corruption, and specifically left wing policies...

Your notion that it is more liberalised is not really so... in some ways, but for FDI, it is not... not to mention the regulations for employees...

As a democracy investors in India face MORE problems in may ways, than China...

It has little to do with a small difference in population...
 
 
Sure, reletive to us India has problems. I meant reletive to China. In that instance it is liberalised.

As far as English and education is concerned. They are comparable. Both have a rapidly growing middle-class which places education at the fore-front of it's priorities. Hence the large number of indian and chinese students at western unis.

Left wing policies...corruption... China is communist! It has corruption by definition! The only thing worse than a left wing policy is a pseudo-left wing policy. That is something that China has in abundance.

In India there is no threat that the state will turn around and decide to take away all your assets purely because thay say so. True,democracy slows economic growth in some ways and causes problems. However it provides reasurance against at least some knee-jerk reactions by the state.

But it isnt in many ways - like Labour laws, and regulation... unions.... etc

But they arent comparable... India has FAR more English speakers

 
Left wing policies...corruption... China is communist! It has corruption by definition! The only thing worse than a left wing policy is a pseudo-left wing policy. That is something that China has in abundance.
 

In terms of the free reign of investment and business - China has more...

And India is MORE corrupt on the TI scale...

 
In India there is no threat that the state will turn around and decide to take away all your assets purely because thay say so.
 

And for FDI there is little chance of that in China too.
 
 
India...
 
 
India probably not likely over the next two centuries. Wait for it.

China not likely in 10 years. But it will, soon enough.
 
 
China and India will be rivals to each other more than anything.

America is bankrupt and is living off huge borrowing that will not go on forever.

Lol I would love for you to try and explain the intricate nature of the world economy. Given the logic and reasoning behind the rest of your posts it would provide me and the rest of D&D a great source of amusement.

Right. Because America is borrowing money from Africa, and receiving African aid.  
 
 
Who exactly is America borrowing from? I think you'll find they actually have a current account deficit.

I do hope those two statements aren't supposed to be contradictory... A current account deficit implies that overall the United States is indebted to various other countries with whom they will be running a trade deficit. The countries which are financing the bulk of this debt are Japan, China and other Asian countries.

The post I was replying to implied that the USA was "borrowing" in the sense that Africa is "borrowing" i.e. in debt. I was highlighting an error; they said borrowing when they meant current account deficit. The USA isn't "borrowing" from anyone they just have, as you correctly said, several very large trade deficits.

What do you think a deficit means?

In this case it means that the USA is spending more on other countries exports than are being spent on their own by others. At no point is the USA borrowing. As that would imply that it has a creditor, which it doesn't. There is nothing to be repaid, there is nothing owed to anybody. It has simply bought a greater value of goods and services from abroad than they have sold.

Er, first of all you're only referring to the trade deficit. The US is currently running a $400 billion budget deficit, which does mean that other countries are buying US debt. The US national debt is about $8.4 trillion. As a percentage of GDP, it's still nothing to be alarmed of, but it's certainly not nothing.

Yes, I was only referring to the trade deficit, because that was the point in question. It also happens to make up the majority of their current account deficit. Around 40% of the national debt is owed by one government department to another (predominantly the fed). The rest is in private hands and, again, is predominantly domestic.

Don't forget that the fed along with commercial banks also owns a large amount of foreign debt.

The US foreign debt is about $3 trillion, hardly a negligable sum of money. It is true that the US owns a lot of foreign debt as well, but I fail to see how that changes the fact that the US is heavily in debt to the outside world. What does the US do when it runs a $400 billion deficit if not borrowing?
 
 
Actualy its about $1.9 trillion. The rest is all owned domestically. It's definitely not negligable. By owning foreign debt it cancels out much of the impact this would otherwise have. Budget deficits are of little worry becasue they go up and down all the time with the business cycle. Sure it's running a deficit now but it will run a surplus in the future. As sure as eggs are eggs.

How did we get here anyway? The guy I was correcting in the first place hasn't even commented since! It seems we both understand the situation anyway.
 
 
the concern for China/india within these periods of time isn't that of chief economic rivalry with the US. Its a question of resources. China consumes 20% of the worlds resources while only producing 5% in 10 years time at its current rate of growth it will be consuming 50% of the worlds resources.

The thing is that China doesn't seem that concerned with who she deals with to get these resources. Zimbabwe, Sudan, Burma, Iran. this is what will make china important in the upcoming years. Like Iran currently, something like 8% of Chinas oils comes from Iran, how will it react to the US and Europes plans to deal with Iran?
 
 
There is no way that China's present growth will continue. They are gradually conceding that they need to allow their currency to revalue and the US will continue to slow. Currently their goods are far too cheap in reletive terms due to the weakness of the Renminbi. Without this advantage and with less demand from the US they will end up slowing down. But not just yet.

Solely because the EU has 50% more people. Then again, the US should surpass the EU in total output within a few years anyway (it already did according to some economic measures).
 
 
The EU's economic average has however been dragged down by the entry of Eastern European countries, in GNP per capita most Western countries aren't vastly behind the US, some of the smaller more economically based states surpass it, although France and Italy are losing ground rapidly.

The US is a bigger economic power than the UK because of a massive population advantage (amongst other things, admittedly) what's your point?

The American GDP per capita is actually over 25% higher than that of Britain, France, or Germany.

Interesting. It looks like Europe is going to have to (once again) get used to its best stock emigrating to the states. We're going to end up a continent of morons.

How come Ireland is so high out of interest? I'm presuming this is investment and not distributed amongst the workforce, since it seems to still be regarded as a good low-wage, high-skill offshore destination.
 
 
I remember reading a while ago about a reverse brain drain to Ireland as emigrants returned home. Can't remember why though.

It would already be the case if we didn't have such a stupid visa system. I think you're going to see a lot of Europeans moving to Canada and Australia due to the preference those countries give to skilled workers.

I don't know the specifics; I recall reading that it's because the Irish work force is really educated now, partially thanks to the massive subsidies Ireland received from the EU, and is leading the way in information-technology jobs.
 
 
Wow. An African country is #3 at the same time as being near the bottom of the human development index. I wonder what the story behind that is.

I guess that's what happens when a country with 500k people is exporting 400k barrels of oil per day. I can only imagine where the oil revenues are going seeing that most people in that country are substinence farmers...

True, though the British economy has been doing very well and is more likely than China or India to overtake American GDP in the forseeable future.

Norway and Switzerland have good GDP per capita too - interestingly neither are in the EU.

And Bermuda seems to be the place to live... no wonder they don't want independence with an economy like that.
 
 
i dont think either however having been to india in 1995 it was in a poor state with limited technology however having also been again recently this year it has advanced miles how ever in my opinion i think there is alot of corruption in the country but the coming of the next commenwealth games should bring in some more money.

one of the main problmes is the children there go to school but then after being educated prefer to go abroad where they think they can make it but are used as waiters etc wheras if there stayed at home with all the knowledge that is in indian and the education system being quite good. if students stayed then this could prove to be vitalfor the economy when competing with countries such as japan and the usa.

sorry about this being long!!
 
 
Will China or India be the chief rival to the US? : YEP

Why the world must watch out for India, China

China's 2005 growth rate lifted to 9.8 percent

times changE
 
 
US GDP - $12 trillion
China's GDP - $2.2 trillion

Now count how many straight years of China having a 10% growth it would take before China catches up to the US (keeping in mind that the US averages 3-3.5% every year).

Of course you should. The output of China is worth more at China's prices. So by considering PPP you can consider the value of that output in physical terms. Hence that is what's used by the OECD. By simply changing the output into $ that data is subject to exchange rate manipulation. As a result, nominal figures for China's output are too low due to the Yuan being kept at an unrealistically low value.

Yea... thanks for that. I am well aware what PPP is. It's also ONE thing used by the OECD...

Except they arent THAT unrealistically low...

The fact is, when it comes to economic clout, the US FAR Exceeds China in terms of global buying power.

Yeah, nobody can argue against that.

PPP isn't going to buy you many foreign-made arms or allow you bribe countries with foreign aid, now will it? Nor is it going to buy you oil. Also, if you're going by PPP, China isn't growing by anywhere close to 10% per year, since the prices there are steadily increasing.
 
 
china might to having a good growth rate but dont you think that any sort of economic growth in which all sectors dont benefit isnt really a growth??? coz it results to the usual - the rich becomes richer, the poor becomes poorer...

chinese govt is on a instable platter and the more they add to that platter of people who dont have any democratic freedom watsoever that platter will fall from imbalance......

neither china nor india miht surpass US for some time, but considering the background to the growth in india vs that of china... i think india is quite a stable economy n therefore even if india does surpass US, india will be there for some time.
 
 
Blind faith in democracy clouds judgement. The Han dynasty of China lasted some 400 years without any need of democracy. The profound teachings of Confucius ensure respect for authority is deeply entrenched in Chinese thought. China is a single mass of collectivist power, immovable as mount Tai and fluent as the Chang Jiang river. How can the light from the glowworm (India) which dwells on the rotting grass compare itself to moon (China) that resides in the heavens?
 
 
China because it's more developed than India, plus the fact that India is a lot less agressive.
 
 
The only place that India rivals is Africa. In poverty.
 
 
Tbh, i wouldn't mind either China or India to **** over the USA. It doesn't matter who's number 1 or 2 but just as long as the USA gets knocked over its ******* perch then i'm cool with it.

With that being said, i think China is going to be number 1 based on some sources i've been reading up on from banks.
 
 
Not for over 30 years at least, but def China! They have a completly different culture and ideology to India. The west has had to much influence in India for it to be as unpredictable as China.

The countries in question might enjoy a high GDP and military power, but so long as the people suffer and do not enjoy basic human rights, the named countries can dream on... they don't come close to the UK's and US's well treatment of it's citizens.

Why the hate on the US? I'm not their biggiest fan either, but if China to ever become number 1, I promise you we will dream of the days the US was number one... China is crazy!

What a stupid post.

China and India will be the only countries able to challenge US hegemony, but with China's one-child policy and India's staggering challenges within its own country, challenging the US is easier said than done.

If China abolishes its idiotic one-child policy and becomes more democratic and liberal then it's only a matter of time before it steamrolls ahead and literally dominates a good portion of the world. If India can unite its country under one banner and rid the country of maoists and the seperatists then yes, it's possible that we'll see a superpower in southern Asia. Both countries have huge obstacles infront of them but with a population of 1 billion odd people at your disposal, the sky's the limit.

you just proved my point. You said IF china becomes more liberal... and that is what I'm saying.... how can china rival the US if it isn't liberal and very oppressive? unless China becomes liberal and democratic... it will have no chance of overtaking the US.

What are 1 billion going to do if you oppress them? treating your citizens well is part of being number 1. You want the world to look up to you with either envy or pride.

China will be able to rival the US economically and militarily in 30-50 years.

Furthermore, let's say for arguments sake that there won't be any revolutions and China continues to grow, perhaps not at a rate of 9% every year but regardless of the number, it'll eventually catch up and overtake the US, thus becoming more powerful.

To back my argument up, the Soviet Union was very oppressive, much like China is today, yet, it was as powerful as the US and at one point in history was even more powerful. Being a liberal country doesn't make you powerful, look at the Netherlands for instance.

You need to be liberal and treat your population with respect, as well as having a military and economic might. Other-wise such nations will never last...to back up my argument...look at what happened to the soviet union.

You've not studied the Soviet Union in great detail then, because I can assure you the oppression wasn't the key factor in its downfall.

Two much spending left the Soviet Union bankrupt and Gorbachev's wild reforms didn't help either.

Well, that may be the case. I do believe that oppressing your population will not work in your favour. regardless of other powers you may possess.
 
 
India as they have a btter political system, and are generally easier for Westerners to apply the lower wage jobs to eg call centres and IT support
 
 
"If china becomes liberal"
"if china becomes democratic"

u all know wat? china becoming democratic and liberal has almost the same probability as sun rising in the west!

in china u cud wake up one morning and see your house being smashed to bits and theres NOTHING tht u can possibly do abt it
bt in india u cant hurt someone n walk off...

it might take more time for india..... but we r gonna come up soon...
 
 
China will starve to death when the US stops buying it's shoddily manufactured crap.
