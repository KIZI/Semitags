Horses rarely blast away from their rivals in the Belmont Stakes
-- unless their name is Secretariat -- they endure the
mile-and-a-half marathon. The third leg of the Triple Crown is much
like the city of New York: grueling but rewarding, gritty but
great.

When a heretofore undistinguished colt named Drosselmeyer went
five wide into the stretch, you could not be blamed for thinking
that there was no way the burly chestnut was going to pass the
horses inside of him. There were a couple of dudes, as in First
Dude and swiftly improving Game on Dude.

Behind him, the highly regarded Fly Down was ready for take off.
Mike Smith was riding Drosselmeyer for the first time. He is a Hall
of Famer based in California and the regular rider of one of the
best horses in the world, the undefeated mare Zenyatta.

"Keep pedaling, keep pedaling," Smith said he thought to
himself, "and he kept trying."

Smith was no stranger here. He made his reputation at Belmont
Park in the 1990s and had won every big race on this circuit except
this one -- 12 times he and a horse took The Test of The Champion,
as Belmont is known, and flunked it each time.

In the grandstand, another horsemen was watching Smith, his new
rider and old friend, grind Drosselmeyer down the stretch.

That horseman was Bill Mott, another Hall of Famer and a trainer
who also made his reputation in New York. He, too, had taken down
about every piece of hardware there is in the nation -- campaigning
the great Cigar to boot -- but Mott had never won a Triple Crown
race.

Suddenly, he was on his tiptoes. Mott had believed Drosselmeyer
was better than his hard-luck finishes in the Dwyer Stakes here
four weeks ago, in the Louisiana Derby and the Risen Star earlier
this spring. The colt and his then-rider, Kent Desormeaux, had
found traffic in those efforts.

Mott and the colt's owner, WinStar Farm, had decided to change
their luck and give Smith the mount. WinStar had already won a
Triple Crown race this year when Super Saver won the Kentucky
Derby.

"When I got the phone call and Bill asked if I was
interested," Smith said his first thought was, "I'm going to win
the Belmont."

Now, here was Drosselmeyer in the middle of the track grinding
away at his challengers and causing Mott's heartbeat to quicken.
Smith and the colt had a long way to go, but the 45,243 people in
the stands were on their feet and seeing the same thing Mott was.

"Mike had him in great rhythm," Mott said.

At the quarter pole, Smith smooched in Drosselmeyer's ear and
took hold of his reins. He rattled them. He crossed them, once and
twice, and then lifted his left arm and gave the colt a couple of
whacks.

"He really kicked in," said Smith. "He kept on going and
going and going."

The Dudes were staggering. Game on Dude peeled back first. First
Dude lost steam next.

"We just couldn't hold it together right there at the end,"
First Dude's trainer, Dale Romans, said. "No excuses."

Smith peeked beneath his shoulder, expecting to see Ice Box, the
Derby runner-up with the monster late kick who was sent out as the
9-5 favorite. But Ice Box was nowhere -- he was loping far back en
route to a disappointing ninth-place finish.

Instead, he saw John Velazquez had Fly Down in full flight.
Velazquez was trying to zoom Fly Down between him, First Dude and
Game on Dude. Smith made Drosselmeyer stand his ground.

"He kept me there when I tried to ride my horse in between
horses," Velazquez said of Smith. "My horse was a little
intimidated."

Velazquez had to yank Fly Down to the outside. It was too late.
Drosselmeyer was crossing the wire three quarter lengths ahead of
Fly Down.

"Once I had him out in the clear," Smith said of Drosselmeyer,
"he showed his heart."

Drosselmeyer had outlasted all challengers. It took him a
wearying two minutes and 31.57 seconds, and it rewarded those who
believed in him an ample $28 for a $2 bet.

But better than that, the colt's victory united a couple of New
Yorkers in the winners' circle. Smith had the one race that had
eluded him, and Mott his first Triple Crown victory. Mott and
Smith's stories are the same as the tens of millions of New Yorkers
who have come here for a couple of centuries: Make it here, you can
make it anywhere, to paraphrase Frank Sinatra.

Smith was 24 when he took his place in the jockey's room here
next to Hall of Famers like Angel Cordero, Jorge Velazquez and
Jerry Bailey. Mott was a newcomer to the circuit, having moved his
stable from Kentucky.

"Billy and I have come full circle," Smith said. "It feels
good."
