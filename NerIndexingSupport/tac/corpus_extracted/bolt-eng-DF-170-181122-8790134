of course they do.
 
 
certainly the folks about to get blown away care but i was wondering about the poster children in this little playpen.

you are somewhere within ten miles of my current position. either pm me or pop me something at yahoo with this name if you would like to meet. am currently at ruta maya for open mike night
 
 
Dude....I'm in Bangkok right now....what the fuck are you talking about....there isn't going to be a massacre.
 
 
 
Dude....I'm in Bangkok right now....what the fuck are you talking about....there isn't going to be a massacre.

 

okay, you want to tell us what is going to happen if and when the remaining red shirts refuse to abandon the encampment the army has surrounded?

the progression i see is encirclement, sniping off the leadership followed by?

if that was our police or troops, the next move after rejecting diplomatic solutions and the protestors refusing to comply with orders, is to hose the whole crowd down.

what do you think is going to happen. i'm only reading news reports. you claim to be on the ground in country. i defer to your reporting.
 
 
You making such statements about the Thai people is indicative of your complete lack of understanding not only of the current situation but also the Thai culture as a whole. They have the Red Shirts surrounded in the Victory Monument area from Praram 4 to Silom to Central Chidlom to Pratunam. From my condo on Radjdamri Rd next to the Four Seasons Hotel we can see the burning tires, troops etc...

The government wil keep them surrounded until they give up....period. There will be no mass bloodshed like you seem to want.
 
 
oh yeah, just what i want --- plenty of bloodshed.

something tells me that you are of an upper caste and aren't going to be of much use to us american peons in support of your peasants. i hope whatever business it is that allows you the luxury of a condo in downtown bangkok isn't one that will make it difficult for your spirit to go anyplace pleasant after your body is dead.

you assume wrong, but then i could be wrong that you are an effete bourgeois pig sitting in a condo with a prostitute or two sucking alcoholic beverages while you watch the fun in the streets below.

one thing i do know about the thai people and their politics is that this sort of thing has happened every few years throughout my whole lifetime. there has never been a wholesale slaughter of dissidents that i know of but according to news reports this year's events are different in a major way.

that is it is written that in the past, the much beloved thai king would step in and settle things down before they got to the stage we are seeing today. this year he has been very ill and not seen since january. is he dying? is the replacement going to be respected?

so how much different is it for the army to be killing a few people at a time over a long period as opposed to blowing everybody away in an afternoon?

You sir are a judgemental ass....and you wonder why you spend your life at open mike nights.....try a little introspection and meditate on why your life is where it's at right now before casting dispersions on others based on your own pathetic, grandiose fantasies. In case you're wondering how a person can afford nice things it's called hard work and sacrifice...obvious alien concepts to some people on these boards.
 
 
It's obviously no big deal. The only thing that's happened so far is killing of 70-some inconsequential civilians who were voicing there pesky little opinions until the government decided that it was time to stomp them out.

Imagine if Iran or North Korea or Venezuela had crushed unarmed civilians like this? Would there be any outcry in western media against it? If your answer is "Yes", the next obvious question is "Why wouldn't there be an outcry against the killing of these civilians in Thailand?"

If you don't have a clear understanding on exactly why this would be, all you need to do is read through some of the responses on this thread. There are some people who believe that this kind of treatment of citizens by government forces is acceptable, so long as it aligns with their political philosophy. Humanity is not part of their equation.

I find that attitude to be a disgusting abomination.
 
 
How long has this been going on? This is going on three months now?

Your ignorance of facts on the ground here are quite evident as well. It woud behoove you to get your news from other agencies besides Al Jazeera and the BBC.

The "civilians" as you like to call them are in fact well armed and in possession of explosive devices. Some of them are in fact muslim separatists from the south of Thailand and THEY are the ones who have been lighting the shopping malls and hospitals on fire....but your "news" sources aren't telling you that are they?

i don't spend my life at open mikes and at least i know how to use my spell checker.

i happen to be an heir to a modest family fortune that is built on a lot of blood, sweat and tears and not the paper game you likely play. i can afford to blow music with my friends on tuesday nights.

fuck you rich man. i'm a blue collar person and proud of it

It's funny how the claims of militant muslims don't come out until AFTER the government starts slaughtering people, isn't it?

Before the slaughter, they're people demanding honest government. Afterwards, they're dismissed as an evil terrorist-related group.

Maybe I swallowed the wrong pill or something, because for some odd reason, I'm opposed to using military force against citizens who are protesting for redress against government issues. Call me crazy, I guess.

....and i don't blame those who have taken up arms in response. If our military was unleashed on protesting citizens, I EXPECT them to fight back.

stay crazy, bro.

remember kent state.
 
 
Yeah...remember Kent State....that'll keep your sorry ass busy....

At any rate since the idiots here who subscribe to terrorists being shot by the government they are threatening are comparing this to Kent State now....let's get some facts out.

I went down to Central World today and listened to the people who lost everything they had when the Kent State like heros of the leftwing douchebags, like tommywho'sbrokebluecollarassucksasasinger for example, went on a wilding spree and set the shopping malls on fire thus burning up the only way for thousands to make a living.

Hey Phil... see if you can get some pictures of dead communists... the more the better.

oh did i get the pretend plutocrat's hackle's up? i'm not a left winger either shit for brains. or broke. or a singer (i'm an instrumentalist and have played with high profile players over the years)

tell me you're in the jewelry business over there and i'll really understand what kind of elitist authoritarian scum and morally bankrupt piece of shit you are.

i have never supported "wilding" and have been in a position to prevent that kind of madness here in america repeatedly since 1965

i do support, and have been severely injured for it, non-violent redress of grievances against elected officials and career bureaucrats, which from the best news sources i have seen in the past few weeks, the majority of the red shirts were peasants with a complaint about the way the current government was formed.

i will not try to apologize for any islamic extremists or other violent crazies that latched onto the peaceful protesters. extremists of all sorts are attracted to this kind of stuff, always have, always will and there will always be assholes like mr fancy watch who will cheer on the forces of so-called law and order no matter what the actual facts are.

'at least he was right about a massacre not being in the cards. thank god.

See that? I was right...you were wrong. I live here with my wife and daughter and work for the U.S. government after an honorabe 20 year military career. I don't sit around, smoke dope, advocate the legalization of heroin so it can be distributed by "entertainment venues", hail the Kent State radicals who terrorized the town for fucking days as heros or brag about my anti-government rallies and all the cool musicians "I played with". The government shot unarmed peope in front of a buddhist temple...this is a tradgedy that someone like you can know nothing about. There will be ramificatiions over this for a decade at least...I volunteered my time to help the city clean up because I genuinely care about the people here and respect my wife's culture...something you have little concept of other than what you can see when you visit your drug dealer for another fix....and your anti-establishment, hippie, I'm such a cool musician routine is quite boring actually. The fact is this. You don't know SHIT about this country or what it's people are like other than what you find on your fucking asian porn sites...so take your self indignation and attitude and shove right up your fat ass. Your lame stories are nothing more than a pack of lies in an attempt to garner credibiity and rep from the other HONEST liberal posters here.

make whatever assumptions you like about me and draw whatever conclusions you like.

be very careful about making libelous statements. you're on the edge of it. chase me around this board and keep flashing shit like that and you might find somebody at your condo door serving you with papers.

i never claimed to know anything about the country you adopted. i only saw a fresh round of political violence that had elements to it that were different than what had happened in the past and from the way things were developing, the possibility of heavy casualties existed. as it was there were too many killed.

and where the fuck were you when kent state happened? those kids didn't terrorize anybody. the ones that were involved in any demonstrations weren't doing anything other than that.

go back to your honorable military memories horseman --- i don't need this board for credibility and i certainly don't expect much support from someone trained not to think.

Your ignorance is indicative of your "burnout" status. I hope you are proud to be so ignorant as to make such a factless supposition as that. I sure as fuck wasn't wilding in that town for the three previous days burning the place down...what were you doing...Orange Sunshine while playing a Dead concert?

you want my address big shot? go back to those porn sites you seem to know so much about.

i'm not the one casting false aspersion here, boyo. why don't you just let it drop? i really don't play on these boards for the pleasure of getting into bullshit with people who don't share my viewpoint.

i'll be glad to argue the arguments --- stow the other crap
 
 
Oh yes you did...you said my wife and daughter were hookers....YOU are a real piece of shit!!!!!!!!
 
 
you assume wrong, but then i could be wrong that you are an effete bourgeois pig sitting in a condo with a prostitute or two sucking alcoholic beverages while you watch the fun in the streets below.[C OLOR="Blue"][/COLOR]

you are truly a fool. i hate to think of people like you armed and in command of other armed people.

when i posted this remark, i had no idea that you had a wife and daughter.

so instead of saying a "well dude it wasn't intentional...sorry" and dropping it...you just keep it going....no wonder you're all alone...your a fucking asshole.

It looks like your trained thinking skills have caused a lapse in judgement. That's what you get for being a dope fiend throughout your entire adult life. Perhaps you shoud allow yourself to think for yourself instead of letting others lead you around like a bull by the nose ring...like I said in an earlier response to your attack on my wife and daughter and their culture....You need to rethink where the fuck your head's at....and don't cast dispersions on people and a culture you know nothing about. Now..put that in your entertainment venue and shoot that up!

Perhaps you shoud allow yourself to think for yourself instead of letting others lead you around like a bull by the nose ring...like I said in an earlier response to your attack on my wife and daughter and their culture....You need to rethink where the fuck your head's at....and don't cast dispersions on people and a culture you know nothing about. Now..put that in your entertainment venue and shoot that up!

 

yo fool, that's aspersions, not dispersions and that comment had nothing to do with your wife or daughter. married men do hire hookers, you know. especially in thailand, where a huge part of their tourist dollar is spent on sex.

as for their culture, can you demonstrate that it is not heavily caste-stratified, that they do not use child labor in their gem-stone cutting factories or that they had nothing to do with the sri lankan civil war? those are the only comments i have made that questioned the thai culture.

you are making some really stupid and false assumptions about me and you are also boring me. clearly you have a reading comprehension problem. i never made any claims to have been trained to think. i suggested that, through your military service, you were trained not to think. i certainly never called your wife and daughter hookers.

your wife and daughter are probably lovely, gentle women. how they got mixed up with a jerk like you makes me wonder.

it's probably a strange hour in bangkok right now. why don't you just go take a little nap before you react to this?
 
 
 
 
 
you assume wrong, but then i could be wrong that you are an effete bourgeois pig sitting in a condo with a prostitute or two sucking alcoholic beverages while you watch the fun in the streets below.[C OLOR="Blue"][/COLOR]

you are truly a fool. i hate to think of people like you armed and in command of other armed people.

when i posted this remark, i had no idea that you had a wife and daughter.

Let me make this perfectly clear for the moderators as I've reported you....You said I'm sitting in my condo with hookers...the only women in my home are my wife and daughter and her friends....I take that as you calling them prostitutes. Even though I know that wasn't your intention it's the perception I got. That's what matters here.

Now act like a man instead of a shithead, apologize and drop it,
 
 
why the fuck should i apologize for your misapprehensions, you sniveling weenie, especially when you are putting out the nonsense you are putting out about me?

i can hardly wait to see what, if anything, the mods are going to say about this when i consider the level of shit they allow. you are blowing nothing into something.

go get some rest. maybe you'll feel better in the morning.

otherwise, fuck off and feel free to take the last word. you get the asshole smilie for any more paranoid delusions.
 
 
Real interesting how you are not man enough to admit your transgressions regarding my wife and kid...but while sitting in your house full of prostitutes I can see where you would become numb to the plight of people who are the victims of human trafficking. You are the worst kind of bigot...the one who hides in plain sight wearing the colors of a liberal. It's not convenient for you to reveal your true bigotted nature until you feel threatened based on your being trained to think like a closetted pinko. Then it all comes out. I actually expected better from someone like you but it's the true nature of people like you to hide in plain sight, then rear your ugly head when it's suits your fancy. You're a pathetic loser who spends their life looking for the next high....looking to regain the feelings you had back in the 60's....that's a pretty sad testament to your existence...
"Yeah maaaaan...tune in, turn on, drop out....it's the man, man...he's holding us back man...let's go start a protest man...we can protest The Man...man."  
 
   
 
 
you're insane. did the tiger bite down too hard once?

YOU brought up your wife and kid. all you had to do was deny being a rich pig hanging out with prostitutes in a high rise watching bangkok burn and that would have been plenty. i would never have even known about the wife and kid.

i promised myself that i would not mix it up with insane nutbags like you on this board. you have already used some pretty foul language that i do not tolerate in my presence in the real world and i simply am not going to stoop to that level (in my world the words that come next the word 'god' are blessings, thanks and praise)

if you absolutely must have an apology before you will back the fuck off me, i am sorry that you somehow made yourself believe that i called your wife and daughter whores.

if they stay with a maniac like you, they must be saintes.
 
 
 
i am sorry

 

Thank you.
 
 
 
 
i am sorry

 

Thank you.

 

now it's your turn.

i won't throw a hissy fit, whine to the mods or blaspheme in the name of anger at you, but you posted some very nasty and untrue things about me.
 
 
you're insane. did the tiger bite down too hard once?

YOU brought up your musical career. all you had to do was say "I'm sorry" for saying "I'm being a rich pig hanging out with prostitutes in a high rise watching bangkok burn" and it never would have came to this.

i promised myself that i would not mix it up with insane nutbags like you on this board. you have already used some pretty foul language that i do not tolerate in my presence in the real world and i simply am not going to stoop to that level.

if you absolutely must have an apology before you will back the fuck off me, i am sorry that you somehow made yourself believe that i used pretty nasty words in your presence and regret inflicting such devastaing pain on your virgin ears....but you did admit you are a doper....

If anyone tolerates your presence they must be insane.
 
 
you want war, go find somebody who likes doing it and has the time to waste oxygen with you.

i have been getting "doped" against my will since i was eight years old mostly because i tend to react violently to people who are hostile-aggressive toward me. if you had spoken to me in the real world that way within arm's reach of me when i was much younger, you would have gotten hurt.

over time, i discovered that music and marijuana help me tolerate assholes in my face, help me eat and sleep when i am overstressed by multiple assholes and their assholish shit. and all without undesirable side effects like the meds the establishment wants to stuff down my throat.

i occasionally use heroin for pain because i am allergic to most pharmaceuticals for pain. if that makes me a doper and a doper is something vile in your world, oh well.

i'm not sure what you are picking up on about my career track, but i assure you whatever it is, isn't accurate. music is my hobby. i have been an amateur performance artist for over 50 years. music provides me a portion of my income --- sometimes a small portion, sometimes most of it. at the moment, due to some recent catastrophic losses, music is providing me with most of my income.

stay nasty if you like. makes it easier to shoot down your bullshit.
 
 
Hey motherfucker....I gave you what you gave me....don't like it? Edit out all the bullshit and get down to the key phrases that matter...it's what I did with your bullshit apology.

now go back to your wife, daughter, condo, tiger, business, whatever the fuck it is you do when you are not filling this board with your mental diarrhea and quit disturbing my peace with your antagonistic horseshit.

agent-provocateurs who were not separatist islamic terrorists. how about that!?!

they have been a plague on the peace and freedom movements in america since the '60's.

as i stated earlier, this sort of political unrest tends to pop up in that region somewhere or other every few years, often with the same sorts of complaints presented by the red shirts this year.

the reports indicated that, in the past, just as things were reaching the boiling point, thailand's "much beloved king" would step in and settle things down. the reason this year's problems were so alarming, was that the king had been very ill and his presence was not being felt.

i have specific interests in and questions about thailand because of my business in stones, metal and finished jewelry. there are three very bad strikes against thailand that i would like somebody to adress: rumor says thai agents are fomenting the sri lankan civil war for the purpose of moving the asian gem cutting center from colombo to bangkok gem cutting factories use child labor purchasing agents buy unique pieces from american jewelers and then mass produce them
 
 
 
and you lay off the 3rd grade Che Guevera revolutionary crap

 

oh please. i'm a product of richard j. daley chicago machine politics.

it's people like me who have kept american streets from burning all these years.

i'm credited by some with preventing riots and mayhem.

Have to disagree with this...Mumbai has one of the largest gem cutting industries on the planet and use child labor because they have hands small enough to manipulate the smaller diamonds and can actually get all 58 facets on diamonds as small as a couple points.

 
gem cutting factories use child labor

 

This is a common practice and well regulated in some countrys.

 
purchasing agents buy unique pieces from american jewelers and then mass produce them

 

Yes this happens..especially with the Russian owned jewelry stores here...if you don't have an international copyright to the design then you don't legally have a leg to stand on. Company's like Bulgari, Cartier etc DO have copyrights yet still have fake stuff of their's offered for sale...the Police do enforce international agreements in relation to this.

no response to the suggestion that the brit and the australian may have been paid agents sent in to subvert the peaceful intentions of the red shirt protesters.

what's up with the king? who is the successor when he dies?

the accusation about thailand is they chain the kids to the machines and many of them are blinded from the work by the time they are 10 years old.

we (american artists) understand the absolute contempt that orientals generally have toward copyright law and we do the best we can to protect our production piece designs from agents. it's not just the orientals --- i cringe when the brazilian buyers step up to my tables too.

my work gets knocked off in base metal and cheap stone all the time, mass produced and sold for as little as $18.00/dz.

i sell similar pieces in sterling and nicer stone in the $5.00-20.00 range. i lose the trendy kid traffic to the lower price but i don't cater to them anyway.
 
 
Patek....

I have read this whole thread and must say that I have gained a ton of respect for you. You seem to be a great family man.. husband and father... with honor and integrity.

You seem to be the kind of man this country and world needs more of.

Of course they were paid...by Thaksin!!!...but not to subvert the Sah Daeng...but to "organize them" and provide financial support.

and the accusations about Thailand child labor practices are just that...accusations. The government here does enforce the law and when they find out about practices ike this they act. As a recent example...there was a Japanese business here in Bangkok that was discovered to be trafficking in humans to the sex industry in Japan....it was infiltrated and and many arrests took place here and in Japan over the last few days. India and Pakistan have 1000 times more to lose by not keeping their status as the gem cutting capitols of asia than Thailand would lose by subverting Sri Lanka.

Right now the Thai people are not really concerned about who the successor to Rama 9 will be...there is some discussion about the significance or connotation of the nuber 10 being used in the title of any successor but at this point there is no named successor to the King and to do so would be a huge insult against him. The King is the single most revered person in Thailand because of what he and his entire family have done for the poor here.

I'm gonna be sick. This is as bad as Obama mentioning his daughter asking "Did you plug the..."

Please, a family man? Who gives a fuck? It's a message board, not a Church picnic.  
 
 
yah right, organize them. you've got the peasants from all over the country coming to downtown bangkok calling for him to resign and he's going to hire a couple of mercs to help them?

you are pulling my leg, yes?

i suppose you are going to try to convince us that thailand's world famous sex business only involves slaving when it's the japanese or koreans doing it?

i think the picture is getting clearer --- you're not a rich businessman, you're a retired spook who married a native woman and settled there.

that doesn't make you a bad person and your discussion is worthwhile.

carry on. i'd like to know more about the king. there are reports that he is totally out of the picture and they are pretty much waiting for him to die. is that true?
 
 
 
i don't spend my life at open mikes and at least i know how to use my spell checker.

i happen to be an heir to a modest family fortune that is built on a lot of blood, sweat and tears and not the paper game you likely play. i can afford to blow music with my friends on tuesday nights.

fuck you rich man. i'm a blue collar person and proud of it

 

how is someone blue collar who is heir to a family fortune?

that sounds more like trust fund baby.

which explains the lack of reality.

see, i have no guilt about what i have. i don't understand people who do, i'm afraid.

we were in manufacturing which included, among other things, manufacturing and installing the electrical systems in all the big towers in chicago, the original playboy bunny costume and custom racing sails for ted turner.

it's not a very big fortune, its a 3-way split and my parents are still alive. i get nothing from the family in the way of support and do not have access to even the interest on my trust until after the parents are gone.

there is no shame in my game. in fact i am quite proud of the achievements of my family, our friends which includes an uncle who was the CoE battalion commander under George Patton and one of the most highly decorated non-combatants in the history of the army.

It should be noted that a compliment of another member gets ridicule from you. This is the first time I have complimented a person this way, but I think he deserves it. He defended his wife and daughter like a father and husband should. He presents his arguments very well.

I felt like complimenting him. What is your problem with that?
