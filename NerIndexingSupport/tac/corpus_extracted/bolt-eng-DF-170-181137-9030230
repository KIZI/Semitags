I couldn't possibly be bothered with predicting the way the playoffs unfold.

All I know is that I'll be rooting for the Bruins even though I have zero confidence that they'll get beyond the second round. I do however like their chances against the Habs.

I'm definitely with you there, manifold. It's too difficult to predict the first round, nevermind anything beyond that when it come to the NHL playoffs.

I think the Bruins-Habs is going to be a tough series, but I'm really pulling for the Bruins.... Probably in Six games. Beyond that I have absolutely ZERO faith in Claude "The Fraud" Julien's chances to take this team any further. I hope I'm wrong, but nothing in the last two seasons has shown me otherwise
 
 
I will be rooting for the Wings, as I have been doing for years after my Islanders once again fail to make the playoffs  

I don't have VS so I won't be seeing much of the playoffs, unfortunately. I blame my declining NHL viewership on the Tampa Bay Lightning; they should never have won the cup. After they did, the NHL had it's strike, they were dropped by ESPN, it was a sign from the hockey gods! A team from Tampa should never have won the Stanley Cup!  

Back on topic, I have only peripherally paid attention to hockey this season, so I have no idea which teams look good. As such, I will fully endorse Sheldon's predictions in the OP.  
 
 
Sheesh.. what a bunch of Hockey Morons...

It's Sharks all the way.....so.. kiss Shark tail...

Thank you, sir. Tastes like a second round loss and a much needed coaching change.

I think the Bruins have a hot goalie so I give them at least a decent shot.

I know that taste. Tastes sweet at first and turns bitter very quickly, leaving a real lousy aftertaste on the way down. I agree Claude "The Fraud" Julien needs to go if this team doesn't reach AT LEAST the Eastern Conference Finals and possibly the Cup Finals.

 
I think the Bruins have a hot goalie so I give them at least a decent shot.

 

A wise hockey fan once told me.... "You can win a game where the other team scores a goal. You can NEVER win a game where YOU DON'T SCORE at least one goal."

I'm much more concerned with the OFFENSE than I am with the defense. Especially once they get a lead and go into that "Prevent Defense" that Claude coaches. When you're up 2-1 halfway through the first period it's time to try and make it 3-1, not time to try and play 50 minutes of defensive hockey, like Claude preaches.
 
 
Alls I know is I better not see any Canadiens diving into posts trying to draw major penalties like Pacioretty did.

The Bruins are going to have to keep their emotions in check throughout the series. They can't take stupid retaliatory penalties when they get slashed, hooked, etc....

As a former HS football coach once said to me.... "The best way to get back at an opponent taking cheap shots is to get back up, point at the scoreboard where you're up by 21 points, and walk away."

The Bruins need to play good, clean, physical hockey. Finish their checks, make their hits count, make the good play, and frustrate the crap out of Le Blu, Blanc, et Rouge. The Canadiens will be at a huge disadvantage if the Bruins keep their cool and just play the game. IF Montreal wants to get nasty, fine drop the gloves and go with it; but let THEM be the ones who start it.

You can thank Felger for the fact that the Bruins even get discussed at all on the radio.

I do laugh my ass off when I here Callahan on EEI trying to talk about the B's now as if he cares, after he spent the last ten+ years (before 98.5) ridiculing any and every caller that dared to want to talk Bruins. What a fuck'n fraud.

Seguin cannot develop until Claude "The Fraud" Julien is out the door.

I honestly think that the Bruins were HOPING that Seguin would go with the #1 pick in the draft and leave them with Taylor Hall. I'm not really sure they wanted Seguin, but after all the "Either one of them is great. We'd be happy to have either Seguin or Hall." talk for almost a year they couldn't NOT pick Seguin with the #2 selection. I base this on the fact that Hall was described as a much better two-way player than Seguin. Seguin is an OFFENSIVE ZONE player. He's never going to be a great two-way guy, and definitely not a defensive force, which is what Julien wants from his forwards. Until the coaching staff allows him to focus on his OFFENSE rather than defense, he's not going to blossom into the type of player he has the potential to be.

I agree. He also seemed a heckuva lot more lucid than his today show interview.

But what about "Nails" Dykstra? He was off his friggin rocker, and Sheen was clearly doing his best to help him out before wisely pulling the plug.

I remember a college buddy of mine once came really close to getting his ass kicked by Scott Zolak.

We were at a club in Boston and in walks Zolak and a couple of other players that I can't remember (back up linemen). And the Patriots had just drafted Bledsoe either that day or within the last day or two. So my buddy, shitfaced beyond reason, just kept yelling "BLEDSOE" within earshot of Zolak every chance he got. Finally, one of the other players came over to our table and politely asked him to stop. Apparently, and understandably in hindsight, the drafting of Bledsoe was the precise reason why Zolak was out drinking that night.

It must've really sucked in training camp when Zo got dropped to third string behind Secules.  
 
 
Detroit all the way. No contest. A lock. Bet your retirement. It's gonna happen.

what probably sucked even worse was when bledsoe got hurt and zo realized he actually was going to have to play. he held a clipboard with the best of them, but he was no damon huarte

The Vancouver Canucks - 2012 Stanley Cup Champions - shut out their recent nemesis, the Chicago Blackhawks, 2-0. It is the first game of a 16 game sweep to the Cup, and the first time a team will have won Lord Stanley's mug without being scored upon!

the Sedin's are great, but the Canuckleheads will be crushed like a cockroachs when they face the almighty, all powerful, incredibly talented, all time most winningest franchise in all of NHL history- the Detroit RED WINGS!!!!

Is that an insult??   A child coaching the greatest sports franchise in history?!!    

Seriously though, I love this time of year - I truly believe that the Stanley Cup is the hardest to win of any of the major championships in sports. The combination of the long regular season, then the playoffs with the overtimes...it's brutal, relentless, and awesome!!

Which ever team wins - they deserve it!

EDIT - except Pittsburgh - if they win it's all luck!!
 
 
 
 
 
Holy shit!

Pass me the mother fuckin' kool-aid!

 

 

 

Thank you, sir. Tastes like a second round loss and a much needed coaching change.

 

Depends. Goaltending can make up for crappy coaching (see Edmonton's run a few years ago, Calgary's run in 04, Anaheim's run with Giggy, etc.). If Thomas is on, and keeps playing like he has all year-the Bruins are going to be very hard to beat.
 
 
Bruins really brought it tonight

Well.. the Sharks looked sleepy but still won....

Goaltenders doing great.... they have the horses if the Defense can step up..
 
 
The Coronation of the Vancouver Canucks continued last night, as Vancouver recorded its second of what will be a 16-game sweep as we march triumphantly toward the Cup. Amazingly and unexpectedly, the Chicago Blackhawks scored! But it wasn't enough, as the Canucks won 4-3.
 
 
The almighty Red Wings will extend their playoff lead over the Coyotes today to 2 -0 at 1:00 PM EST today.

It's a lock- bet your 401K, your house, and your fat ugly children on a Detroit win today.

Wings now officially up 2-0.
Had you dummies followed my advice your retirement plans would have significantly increased in value, your house payment would have decreased, and your fat ugly children,....well they'd still be fat and ugly - like you. (Unless you're a Red Wings fan, then your children would be leaders of men and seducers of women.)
Go WINGS!!!
 
 
Habs go up 2-0 against the Bees. Boston is 0-26 in playoff series when going down 0-2. There doesn't seem to be much reason to expect them to go 1-26.

The 2011 Stanley Cup Champions, Vancouver Canucks, made it 3-0 against the Chicago Blackhawks. This game belonged to Canuck netminder Victor Luongo who stood on his head, robbing Patrick Kane blind a couple of times. In truth, Chicago were the better team tonight, and left everything on the ice. But champions have to win games where they are outplayed, and Vancouver did so tonight. Tuesday should see the end of the series and a well-deserved break before the Vancouver's next hapless victim!

Thanks to my wife, who is friends with Tim Lieweke the CEO of AEG, I am sitting in a luxury box at the Staples Center for tonight's game versus the Sharks. WOOHOO!!!

Since AEG owns the team, I am imagining it is at center ice (fingers crossed!!) but ya never know. Hell, I'd go if the seats were in the nosebleeds.  

The Kings are wearing their black uniforms and the fans are have been asked wear BLACK clothes and wave BLACK towels. It should be fun!!!

I'll shoot a few photo's and post 'em manana!!

GO KINGS!!!
GO WINGS!!!
 
 
Cool! Have fun Zander!
 
 
 
 
 
What an incredble game. The Kings came out fast and scored a goal within a minute! The fans go wild!!! Then 90 seconds later took a 2-0 lead. The 21000 fans at the sold out Staple center were roaring- seriously- it was incredible! The fun didn't stop, by the end of 1st period the Kings had a 4-0 lead. We were feeling pretty good. Then a cheap goal snuck past Jonathon Quick. Dissappointing, but not earth shattering. After all, we still have a 3 goal lead!. This is the playoffs- nobody comes back from a 4 goal deficit- EVER!!!

Then midway through the 2nd the Sharks Joe Thornton hit a gorgeous one-timer through the five hole to make it a 4-2 game. It was a beautiful goal. I was getting slightly nervous, but still confident that the Kings would win. Suddenly BOOM- just a few minutes later a power play goal makes it a 4-3 game...uh oh.....

The Kings rally, and a short minute or so late score a textbook goal from the right slot!! WOOHOO!!! We're back to a 2 goal lead- King 5- Sharks 3. Feeling confident again and so is the crowd.

But the SHarks never gave up hope and on another power play- cut the lead back to 1. Uh..oh... before I knew it we were tied 5-5 and headed to overtime. OMFG!!

The sharks had the momentum and the skills to close the deal and 3 minutes in put the game away 5-6 Sharks win....

What a roller coaster!! Fun, but exhausting.

PS- I caught a great photo of the 1st king goal- I will load it later.
 
 
The Wings get the job done in 4.....sahhwweeet!!! Now they'll rest and get ready for their next victim.....
 
 
Game 4. Habs will win 3-1, third goal being an empty-netter.

Bruins sux.

 
 
 
Here are a few photo's from the Kings game on Tuesday night.
This the first goal- that's the puck going through the net!! Luck shot eh?

 
 
 
Here's another lucky shot - this time the sharks scoring on the Kings..BOO!!!
 
 
 
Here's the important photo.....

It's looking like the Sharks got their mojo back... sorry Zander...
 
 
Maybe the Bruins are going to make it 1-26.
 
 
Good pics Zander. You get any numbers?  

 
Maybe the Bruins are going to make it 1-26.

 

You wash your mouf out with soap this instant, mister. Shame on you. Shame.
 
 
 
Maybe the Bruins are going to make it 1-26.

 

And 1-6

In those 26 series, 6 times they managed to tie the series at two a piece, obviously going on to lose anyway in the first 5. But here is the kicker, all 6 were against the Habs.
 
 
 
 

 

times are eastern.

1 caps over 8 rangers
2 flyers over 7 sabruhs
6 habs curbstomp the faggy 3 bruins

3 wings over 6 yoties
5 preds over 4 ducks

Holy shit!

Pass me the mother fuckin' kool-aid!

 

But he is right  
 
 
GO BRUINS!!!!!

Been a Bruins fan since I was a child. Bobby Orr was my childhood sports hero.

Right now we're in a war with the evil Canadiens.

I hate Montreal. They're the Yankess of the NHL.

 
 
 
 
Good pics Zander. You get any numbers?  

 
Maybe the Bruins are going to make it 1-26.

 

You wash your mouf out with soap this instant, mister. Shame on you. Shame.

 

Did I mention that my wife was with me??    
 
 
Bruins are my team but I also root for the Lightning too ever since they became a franchise in the 90s.

And DAMN they are going all Deliverance on Pittsburgh right now in the early game. They were up at one point 7-0. Now it's 7-2.

This win will make it a 3-2 series. The Bolts may still have a chance.
 
 
The massacre is over. 8-2 is your final.

If the Bolts can win Monday at home they'll push it to Game 7.
 
 
 Henrik Zetterberg and Johan Franzen will be ready for the Detroit Red Wings in Round 2 ........and then you will witness the awesome firepower of this fully armed and fully operational battle station!!! WOOHOOO!!!

PS- Thanks Phoenix Coyotes, we appreciate you laying down like lambs in 4 easy games so the Mighty Red Wings can rest our starters and get healthy for the next round. You're the best Phoenix!!

GO RED WINGS!!

Offense hasn't been the Red Wings' problem. They rank near the bottom of the league in GAs and I'm not positive their goalie can step up in the deep games in the playoffs.
 
 
Defense wins championships and Detroit is stacked. Jimmy Howard has been hot in goal after a mediocre regular season. With Nick Lidstrom, Franzen, Kronwall, Rafalski, and Stuart all peaking at the right time - they Wings are the best defensive team in the playoffs right now, and the team to beat. Period.

You're speaking with your heart and not your brain. The Red Wings are 23rd in the league in Goals Against and Howard is giving up 2.5 goals a game.

Sorry to burst your bubble but that isn't the best defensive team in the playoffs. Not even remotely close.

Will they get better on D in the playoffs? Maybe. But we haven't seen anything to indicate that yet.

Zetterberg has been in beast-mode this year and is playing extremely strong. He sure is fun to watch.
 
 
We'll see what happens. The Stanley Cup is the hardest championship to win in sports. Anything can happen. I like Detroit's chances, especially with Zetterberg back in the line up.

Nobody is playing better than Detroit right now- that is why they are at home resting up, getting laid in their own beds every night, and getting healthy. Meanwhile the other playoff teams are all playing long, hard games, getting beaten up, and tiring out. And the Vancouver Canuckleheads- the "pre-ordained" favorites, will be lucky to get to the next round!

The regular season doesn't mean shit in the playoffs. The Wings were 23rd in goals against (2.89) this regular. But remember: The Wings were 20th in goals against (2.93) in 2008-09, when they went to Game 7 of the Cup final. The regular season doesn't mean SHIT in the playoffs.
 
 
Damn. My Bruins are giving me a heart attack.

Knotted up at 1 headed into double-overtime.
 
 
WOW!!!!! Tim Thomas just made an incredible save 2-on-1 in double-overtime.
 
 
BOOM!!!!! Bruins win in double-overtime.

Boston now leads 3-2 over the evil Habs.
 
 
lol

The Habs did the same thing a couple of years ago, going up 2-0 against Carolina, going home, and blew it.

I can tell you there will be a lot of smug Canadiens fans north of the border crying in their beer tonight!
 
 
My wife is from Boston......I am happy for the Bruins fans. Tonight they will  

Still gotta win 4 though.........  
 
 
The regular season doesn't mean shit in the playoffs...Vancouver had the best record in hockey and led the WEST by 10 points. Chicago barely scraped in to the playoffs and was the 8 seed.....- after falling down 3-0 in the series - the Blackhawks have now tied the Canucks in their series....   Bring on game 7!!!!

The regular season don't mean shit...this is the PLAYOFFS!!! WIN OR GO HOME!!!

Quit yer whinin. The Bruins didn't come to play last night at all. Taking stupid penalties. Marchand missing the EMPTY NET. No fire. No fight. No heart whatsoever.

The one good thing that will come from their loss tonight is that hopefully Neely will start the housecleaning tomorrow morning about 8am. Here's a starting list of who needs to go in my mind..... Julien, Chiarelli, Chara, Thomas, and possibly Bergeron (for the stupid delay of game penalty last night). Marchand should be fined his playoff check for missing that open net, too.

Milan Lucic awaits word on possible suspension

Hit on Jaroslav Spacek may lead to suspension

MONTREAL  The Bruins found themselves down a man, a very big man, early in the second period of last nights 2-1 loss to the Canadiens in Game 6 of their first-round playoff series.

Milan Lucic was given a five-minute major for boarding and a game misconduct after he hit Jaroslav Spacek into the boards at center ice. Spacek hit his head on the glass and got cut. He fell to the ice and stayed there for quite a while until he was attended to by the team trainer. Spacek eventually got up and was led to the dressing room. He got a few stitches and returned to the game, playing 16:31.

...

If the league stays consistent  and thats a big if  Lucic should be able to play in tonights Game 7.

It won't help. That team is DONE. They proved it last night. No heart. No guts. No balls. No brains. From the coach/GM right on down to the fourth liners.

What they should do tonight, regardless of any suspension is get Seguin one game of playoff experience before they get shown the door by the Habs so that whoever the next coach is doesn't have to try and do all of that next year.

The same person who years ago taught me a couple of things about sports in general and hockey specifically.....

1. Players are paid to WIN GAMES, not play them. (refers to all of them)

2. Mental mistakes are far worse than physical ones and should bring a much greater penalty. (refers to Thomas and Bergeron especially)

3. There's a difference between being sore, being hurt, and being injured. If you're not playing in the playoffs you better be the latter, and have the hospital bill to prove it (Chara)

4. Leadership is not saying "Go do this." Leadership is saying "Follow ME." (Chara)

5. In hockey the Regular Season means nothing. Keep all your stupid regular season awards and accolades. The only thing that matters is the Stanley Cup. (all of them)

Thomas, Chara, and bergeron are all good players, hence my stupid stick comment  .

Sure Thomas is a little too wild in the net at times but he does save a LOT of shots, best in the league save percentage for the season IIRC.

And Bergeron is good even if he made a stupid clear that ended up causing the loss last night. Well that and NO ONE scored after the first goal....AGAIN.
 
 
 
Thomas, Chara, and bergeron are all good players, hence my stupid stick comment  .

 

Being a Good/Great player is only PART of the equation so far as I'm concerned. In my mind there is another attribute that needs to be part of the equation... being a SUCCESSFUL player. I don't believe that any players should be in the HOF unless they have achieved BOTH Greatness and Success. For example....

Bobby Orr.... Great Player and Won the Cup: Hall of Famer

Ray Borque (my favorite player of all time).... Great Player, but if he hadn't won the Cup in Colorado I would suggest he didn't belong in the Hall of Fame

Cam Neely.... Great Player, no Ring: No Hall of Fame in my mind.

The true GREATS have the ability to put their teams on their backs and carry them to a Championship.

It would be fairly hard for a defenseman to carry a team to a championship. I can see your point where forwards and goalies are concerned.

I'm not a Chara fan. He doesn't appear to put full effort on the ice; to be fair to him, his extremely large frame may have more to do with it than the amount of effort, it's hard to say.

This is obviously just my opinion, but if you don't watch a game 7 your team is playing in, especially after watching the previous games, you are not a fan. Being a sports fan involves enjoying the good AND suffering through the bad. Being in a playoff game 7 isn't a bad, even if you think they should have won the last game

As I said earlier, until they make those changes they're not a rooting interest of mine anymore. I do not have the time, interest, or energy to invest in teams that I don't think are doing things the right way or meeting my expectations. I require a return on the investment of my time, attention, and energy.

I walked away from the Boston Red Sox after Game 3 of the 2004 ALCS and haven't followed them with anything more than a passing interest since.

I am shocked the Bolts came back in the series like they did. Winning 3 in a row is damn hard in playoff hockey.
 
 
 
Epic meltdown by Montreal....congrats Bruins fans!

 

 

 
They hadnt won a Game 7 of any kind since 1994, when they played in the Old Garden and Boston had a new mayor named Tom Menino.

They were eliminated in heartbreaking Game 7s each of the last three seasons, and there were questions about their hearts and souls when they took the ice last night for the final game of their 33d playoff series against the hated Montreal Canadiens.

For one night, the Bruins made all the pain go away. No more agita on ice. Nathan Hortons booming slap shot in the sixth minute of overtime beat the Canadiens, 4-3, in Game 7 of their first-round playoff series last night at TD Garden.

Game 7. Bruins-Canadiens. Overtime. How much better does it get?

 Game 7 joy for Bruins - The Boston Globe 

 

 
 
 
 
Epic meltdown by Montreal....congrats Bruins fans!

 

Nothing to congratulate the Bruins for. They beat a LOWER SEEDED TEAM in a FIRST ROUND Playoff Series. It took them ALL 7 GAMES to do it, and in THREE of their four wins, it required OVERTIME to get the job done. That's not something to celebrate in my mind.
 
 
   
 
 
The bruins deserved the win...not based on gameplay but based on montreal's cheap cheating tactics of trying to get penalties through acting and diving.

That 3rd goal by kelley was instant carma and that last goal by horton made me feel better about suban's goal on thomas.
 
 
 
Round 2 starts this weekend on Broad Street in Philadelphia against the Flyers. For sure, there are plenty of Philadelphia stories to be told, but let the Bruins and their fans enjoy last night for a few more hours.

...

Nothing could top the abject failure of the 2010 Bruins, who had a 3-0 series lead in the second round against the Flyers, saw the dominance fizzle as the Flyers won three straight, then came home to Causeway Street and lost, 4-3, after leading, 3-0.

A 3-0 lead at home in a Game 7 is a lock... unless you are the Bruins. Those Bruins coughed up four consecutive goals and went home for a summer of speculation about their mental toughness.

This was a lot of luggage to carry into the Jeremy Jacobs barn last night.

Yes, he was holding his stick and pretending he was being hooked down. I was so annoyed when he was the one to score the tying goal, too...

Then there was that other one who ran right into our guy who was standing still, and the Montreal player went down and acted like he just got hit by a bus...

Most impressive goaltending so far: Rinne

Guy is a beast!

 

This is true. It's funny how the Preds never get any recognition, but they usually make the playoffs, and advance to the 2nd round each year. Been a really solid for a while now. And Trotz still wont win the Adams.

 

Yeah they definitely get slept on. Not good enough to make it to the conference final, imo, but I think they can give VAN a run for their money.

That O'Brien trade is looking pretty good now.  
 
 
How about my Bruins, baby!!!!!
 
 
 
How about my Bruins, baby!!!!!

 

MMM.. does 3-0 ring any bells..
 
 
I think Thomas has a good chance at winning the Vezina this year. Right now he's the front-runner. The kid is a beast between the pipes. Would love for him to add another one to his trophy case. He broke the record this year for the best regular season Save Percentage in NHL history and had the best Goals Against Average this year. He's amazing.

Best goalie in hockey this year.

 
 
 
Canucks represent at the Royal Wedding. At 0:33.

lol

Them's my peeps!
 
 
 
How about my Bruins, baby!!!!!

 

The Flyers are just spotting the Bruins 3 games so they can come back and win the series LIKE LAST YEAR.      
 
 
Detroit will take the home ice advantage today after they blow out the Sharks 6-1. It's gonna be an epic slap down.
 
 
Datsuyk had his stick broken just now on a SJ PP. Is he forbidden to go and get a stick or is it just the pressure preventing him from skating over to the bench?
 
 
2 to zilch Sharks!!!!!

When a player breaks his stick he must drop it immidiately. Failure to do so results in a 2-minute minor.

Once you have a broken stick you can grab another from the bench or one of your teammates (not the goalie) can give you his.

You're allowed to go to the bench to get another stick, or use somebody else's stick. You can't play with a broken stick though (minor penalty).

It's an unwritten rule though not to leave the defensive zone while on a PK and the puck is in there. Players never do it, too risky.

edit: sorry didn't the post above this.
 
 
Uh oh. Sharks take a 2-0 lead in the series.

Detroit could only win by whining, preference by the refs and getting pussy fake penalties on the Sharks..

Detroit has great players but their mostly prima donnas.

I think their defense is VERY overrated.

And Howard's not good enough to steal a series.

I think the Sharks are playing at their potential in this series, I just hope it lasts.
The Sharks defense isn't all that strong either. They made plenty of goofy passes out of the D zone in the Kings series. So far.. they've picked it up with Detroit..
 
 
Great game today. In Playoff hockey you never get worried unless you lose one at home. 2 games in Detroit coming up....... Detroit should win both. Then we just need to steal one on the road and watch as Thornton and the Sharks do what they do best.....CHOKE!
GO WINGS!!

They are pretty confident these days..especially after coming back from a 0-4 deficit against the LA Kings in game 3 of that series. They may have the spunk to get there this year......we'll know soon enough. Either way, the games have been great.

It's ok, as an Islander fan I'm going to have A LOT of fan madness if they ever put out a good team.  
 
 
lets
go
bruins
 
 
Oh snap 2-0 at 1:03 into the game
 
 
 
bruins win 5-1

i think they actually scored on the power play
 
 
And that's why I predicted the Bruins to make a lot of noise in the playoffs. Tim Thomas is a complete animal. They're playing well as a team, and nice rounded out offense and defense. However If they win this series, Tampa's going to be a real tough matchup.
 
 
Well, it looks llike a repeat of last year for the Wings......down 3-0 to the Sharks. ughh
 
 
 
bruins win 5-1

Truly, the end of the world is upon us.
 
 
Well the Eastern Conference Finals look all but decided. Bruins and Lightning battle about to break out. Should be a war. One of the best and explosive offenses against the best goalie in hockey. Should be fun.

And in the West I'm going with Vancouver and San Jose.
 
 
The east coast teams are weak... Sharks are in butt kicking mode...

Bruins.. make me laugh...

They always do that with Detroit. Since the lockout they've been out of the top 5 least penalized teams once (and they were #6). Even before they've never had the same amounts of calls go against them.

Very interesting indeed.......
 
 
Man up whiners. The Wings are disciplined. The don't get penalized because that is the way they play.

East coast teams are weak...So Yup...
 
 
The Canucks are 1-4 in elimination games. They can't bury teams either, with their victories mostly by a goal, often in overtime. This doesn't look like a team with a killer instinct.

Ryan Kesler's has the killer instinct but he can't continue carrying the team.., The Sedin bros. haven't really stepped up to the challenge yet... The team plays well overall but yup..lack the intensity.
 
 
   
 
 
Tonight, the Mighty Red Wings come back from the dead and beat the flopping Sharks in front of their own fans!! 3 unanswered goals in the 3rd period. Sweet!!!! Bring on game 6 at the Joe!!!

I can't believe how fast Philly and Washington folded. Boudreau (sp?) might be getting under some more heat again.

Here goes:

Still riding on that D-town train all the way. They beat San Jose in two more nail-biters, then go on to beat the Sedin twins & co IN Vancouver--yeah that's right Toro  

I've been sleeping on Tampon Bay and I think they could really give Boston a run for their money, but as much as I hate to say it I think the chowda bitches are the better team between the two and they will go on to face the Red Wings for the Cup. Which would be cool to see two old teams go at it. Although maybe two teams from non-tradiotioal markets could be better for the game as a whole.

No kidding. I don't like how NHL broadcasting rights are set up now. For some reason Versus comes in like crap on our TV. There's wavy lines that go across the screen which makes it pretty much unwatchable. But that's what bars are for  

Personally I wish they would put ALL the playoff games on both NBC and Fox. Just no Joe Buck. The sport needs more post-lockout exposure, and it kind of feels like ESPN snubs the league, like they don't give it as much attention as the NBA even though attendance figures are about identical.

Philly yes, They really weren't all that good. Washington was, but they can't get it together in the playoffs.

Well it's official. There will be a game 7 showdown.

Damn. At this point I'll take the Wings. They're playing like their old selves.
 
 
Game 7 will be a brawl. Detroit will pull it off, again. Over the last 3 games we've seen an incredible comeback by an incredibly talented and resilient team. Tonight they showed why the are the  best team in the NHL over the past 10 years.  Can't wait to see game 7!!

I'm with Zander on this. Remember, this was the first game of the series that didn't end with a 1 goal difference, and it could easily have! This has been a VERY close series. Also, considering how infrequently teams have been able to come back from down 0-3, the Sharks still have a good chance (much as I hope they lose horribly   ).

Who knows, maybe we'll get a multiple-overtime nail-biter!

The knock on the Sharks is that they are soft.

However, it is still a difficult feat to have to come back from 0-3 and win the final game on the road. That has rarely happened.
 
 
I think that Clowewill actually be the difference maker, if the Sharks are going to win. I'm the biggest J. Thornton fan you can find-but the guy just doesn't have the killer instinct. It's just not in the guy.

Congratulations to the Sharks! That was a great game 7. I wish Detroit won, but that's the way it goes, there's always next year!!

As an aside for Sharks fans - If the Sharks don't win the Cup this year, they'll still be known as "Chokers" - they'll say- remember when they let Detroit come back after going up 3-0......

the pressure is on!!

The Lightning are a very strong team. Boston needs to get its act together if they want to win the series.
 
 
The last time the Lightning won the Cup we had the lockout, the loss of ESPN, rules changes, etc.

Either Boston or the team that comes out of the West needs to beat them or chaos is sure to ensue!

The 2nd period was great as we outscored them 5-1... It was nice to see them break out the scoring but, what concerns me is they outscored us 2-1 in the 1st and 2-0 in the 3rd. A little too close for comfort at the end there!

That first period, the first goal, was all thomas. It was horrible, I just took my first sip of my sam adams and BAM, the green light is going off...surreal.

Yeah I was NOT IMPRESSED with the bruins defenders last night. They left thomas out to dry a few too many times.

Yeah, I think that first goal was something like 17 seconds in... And toward the end there Thomas almost has his head taken off twice by his own players! Geesh!

I don't know if I blame that first goal on Thomas. The puck took a perfect bounce from behind the net to land right on Hall's stick. They could do that another 100 times, and it probably wouldn't happen again. Also the defensemen (forget who it was on Hall), should have been on him a little more, get your stick in there, or do so something-let him know you're there.

I'm not so sure any NHL goalie would have had that 1st goal. With that said Thomas needs to pick it up in the series. At least Rask is good enough to play a game or two if needed.

He just wasn't in position with the puck behind the net is all. I was RIGHT BEHIND him, lol.

The Bruins are back in the series, which is nice.

But I'd feel a lot more confident about their chances if they could have played a 0-0 third period.

You are right, They have to shut down tampa from scoring more than 1 or 2 goals for a game.

Exactly. Getting into a shootout with the Lightning is NOT going to be to Boston's advantage. That will play right into Tampa Bay's strengths. You're not going to beat them 6-5 too many times. The Bruins need to come out and SHUT THEM DOWN for the first 20 minutes. Claude "The Fraud" Julien also needs to get it through his head that playing "Prevent Defense" doesn't work any better for protecting a lead in the NHL than it does in the NFL. Especially against a team with as much scoring power as Tampa Bay has.

And they need to put SHOTS ON NET!!!! even bad ones just for the rebounds.

And on the powerplay PARK SOMEONE in front of the darn goalie!

OK, Yes, high scoring games will not be to their long term advantage.
 
 
 
And they need to put SHOTS ON NET!!!! even bad ones just for the rebounds.

And on the powerplay PARK SOMEONE in front of the darn goalie!

 

Don't even get me started on the inability of Bruins players to actually hit the 24 square feet that comprise the face of the net. That's been an issue for my entire life. The Bruins have been some of the worst shots in the league for years.

As for parking someone in front of the net... You're absolutely correct. I came up with a means to reinforce that a couple years ago.... In the practice arena you imbed kind of an invisible dog fence wire in the ice around the front of the net. All the forwards get a shock collar. At any time that there is no forward in that area in front of the net for more than 3 seconds they ALL get a 20K volt shock. THAT might finally get it into their heads that you STAY THERE.

Of course in reality the biggest problem is that Claude "The Fraud" so de-empahasizes OFFENSE that his third forward (the guy who should be in front of the net) is generally expected to be skating backwards towards the blue line to ensure there isn't an odd man rush going the other way if the wingers lose the battle in the corner.

I was born in Winnipeg so I have a sentimental attachment to the NHL being there. But I'm not convinced that the NHL can work in that city long term.

My guess is they'd bring back the Jets name and uniforms.

Bolts come back to beat the Bruins! W00T! Didn't think that was coming after the first period.
 
 
WOW. What a worthless bunch of gutless, spineless, no accout cock-sucking motherfuckers wearing the spoked-B in Tampa Bay this afternoon. They should all be rounded up and SHOT for what they did (or more truthfully what they DIDN'T do) on the ice this afternoon. If their plane crashed on the flight back to Boston tonight I wouldn't shed a single tear.

I'm done with these motherfuckers until Julien, Chiarelli, Chara, Kaberle, Lucic, and about half of the other players are GONE from Boston.
 
 
Damn. My boys let the Lightning come back. Way back.

Have to take my hat off to the Bolts. They are a spunky bunch and are never out of it. Those bastards came back from 3 down. They have one of the most explosive offenses in the NHL. They can put points on the board in a hurry.

Looks like they were right in pulling Roloson for Smith. Smith had some outstanding saves. Wonder who they will start next game? If it was me I would go with the hot hand, Smith.

This series will probably go the distance. What a war!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 
 
Holy momentum swings batman!! TB was down 0-3 in this game - they rally hard, come back and win. Now they have tied the series and the momentum has seriously shifted.....Bruins need to step the fuck up.
 
 
If the Bolts are smart they'll start Smith over Roloson next game. After they pulled Roloson after going down 0-3 Smith stepped in and was clutch. Had some fantastic saves.

Gotta dance with the one that brung ya.

Roloson didn't play bad. He was at fault on the first goal, certainly not the second, and the third was similar to Tampa's tying goal. He was pulled for psychological reasons. I'd be surprised if he didn't start game five.
 
 
I guess about 200 people who showed up at a "Save the Thrashers" rally yesterday according to PHT...

Agreed. Roloson will get the start as he should. He's been the man and will continue to be the man. Smith played well, but he's second fiddle...at least for the rest of this year!

I'm guessing Vancouver will be sticking a fork in it soon.. oh well...

TB has been awesome throughout the playoffs...I didn't expect Boston to blow a 3-0 lead in a playoff game 2 years in a row. My only concern about SJ/VAN is it seems one or the other has been the best regular season team in hockey for about the last 5 years now, only to lose somehow to inferior teams every time. As a Flyers fan, I've had a ton of respect for Lecavlier and St. Louis since those guys won the Stanley Cup about 7 years ago. It'd be nice to at least see Simon Gagne get a chance to hoist the cup too.

I totally agree. TB has clutch players. St Louis among the best. They may not be the best team but they seem to be able to win big games.

I agree. TB certainly can win it. They have veterans who've won it before, some good youth and a hot goalie.

Usually (but not always) the Stanley Cup is won by one of the top teams. However, a team no one was expecting will often come out of nowhere and get to the final. That team usually doesn't win, however. I would see TB as that type of team while Vancouver and San Jose are amongst the top teams.

Vancouver seems to be getting stronger. IMHO they are the best team remaining, and will beat San Jose on Tuesday, and will go on to beat whomever comes out of the east. But I could be wrong. I'm horrible at making sports predictions.

Considering the last time the Lightning won the NHL was broken, I hope they don't do it again!  
 
 
 
Agreed. Roloson will get the start

 

Ahem. Smith is starting as I thought he would. And he deserves it. He was key in that win.

Always go with the hot hand.

Let this be a lesson. Do not argue hockey with me

They will regret it. I see a Boston blow out coming!! Maybe that's what you were hoping for?... Hmmmmmm!!!! ?????  
 
 
Actually I was hoping Roloson would start. We have a better chance against that old man. Smith has the potential to be pretty good.

And right now Smith is playing very nicely.
 
 
Through 2 periods, Bruins 12 shots and 2 goals.
 
 
19 shots and 2 goals scored = FAIL

Tampa made the wrong call and paid dearly for it. You go to the dance with the one that brought you! Bad coaching imho....
 
 
Tampa outplayed Boston and lost.

I would have started Rolo too. Smith played OK tonight but 2 goals on 19 attempts is pretty weak- and unacceptable for the playoffs. Both were full strength goals. He was great on the power play.....
 
 
YEAH BABY!!!!!

One win away from going to the big dance.

Why do I have a feeling Tampa will force a Game 7.

The lightning had so many powerplays in the first period. They could have gone up by a few goals easily and this would have changed the game indeed.

They didn't. There is no game 7 here in my view.

But I thought McCain would win. :P

It's been a good run so far though. We've seen the 1-3-1 trap beaten by skill and I love that in and of itself as most teams will forgo this talentless method of defense and seek talent instead.

I've about had it with the Nucks diving bullshit..

I hate that shit...

The shit hardly ever works yet the retards keep trying it...

Besides if it wasn't for Campolli's stupid play the Hawks most certainly would have disappointed the parade for a 3rd straight year...
 
 
Can't believe the Sharks let Vancouver tie it up so late.
