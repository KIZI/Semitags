If Tuesday night's elections were a referendum on President Barack Obama, it was
not because he sought to make it that way.

In fact, Obama mostly held the candidates at arm's length.

It was in keeping with his pattern as president _ largely distancing himself
from Democratic candidates and declaring early on that there is little meaning
to be found in isolated off-year elections. In race after race, the wariness has
been a two-way street, with candidates reluctant to bring in a president with
mediocre approval ratings and the White House reluctant to link him too closely
to a potential loser.

The White House arguably had its hands tied in the races that were decided on
Tuesday night. Obama was all but required to endorse Arlen Specter after the
Pennsylvania senator switched parties to become a Democrat and voted to support
several of the president's initiatives, including the health-care overhaul. But
the White House viewed Specter as a problematic candidate in the Democratic
primary _ a former longtime Republican, and worse, one that his opponent cast as
an opportunist _ and exhibited caution in sending the president to help. Obama
went once.

Similarly, in Arkansas, a state Obama lost and where his approval ratings are
low, local operatives wanted him only in small doses. He recorded a radio ad for
Sen. Blanche Lincoln that was targeted at the large African American communities
in the Memphis media market. But he never visited, and although that was at the
campaign's request, it also signaled the measured approach of the
administration, several strategists inside and outside the Obama operation said.

The president also did not get involved in the House race in Pennsylvania, a
special election for the 12th Congressional District seat held by the late John
Murtha and the one race that Democrats widely described as a bellwether for the
November midterm elections. Democrat Mark Critz, a former aide to Murtha,
defeated Republican businessman Tim Burns.

White House officials and analysts alike cautioned against overinterpreting
Tuesday's results.

"The only one that makes any real difference in terms of the president is PA-12
_ and he didn't go," political analyst Charlie Cook said of Obama. "He didn't
stick his neck out real far for Blanche. He didn't stick his neck out for
Specter; he did the minimum. There were a lot of interesting races out there,
but for the White House, the PA-12 is the only one that matters."

Two White House advisers agreed, saying the Pennsylvania House race was the only
one that had, in the words of one, "the most potential to tell you about the
fall" elections, because it pitted a Democrat against a Republican.

A year and a half into his term, Obama's mixed electoral record has perplexed
operatives who thought his charisma and tactical skill would yield a stronger-
than-ever Democratic majority. Instead, Democrats have lost the biggest
elections so far on his watch _ the governorships of Virginia and New Jersey and
the Senate seat that belonged to the late Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts.
