 Pattinson says he now wants to do an R-Rated version of Twilight ! 

What do you guys think ?

This is a bad idea - girls talking about Twlight will increase threefold  

More importantly - will you be watching ?  
 
 
If I had to see hobo face naked

Agreed.  
 
 
he's pondering
not thread worthy
and twilight isnt anything worthy...........
 
 
He already has screwed her.

And this slightly off the facts. breaking dawn has sex in it.

thats what hes on about

and hes a ****
 
 
I hate twilight, but from the porn angle, Ill watch anything.
 
 
no thanks, but plenty of girls would. and maybe men too.
 
 
Does his shizzle sparkle too?

He looks a lotttt better than the guys in your sig do! yuck!
 
 
theres a difference between a porno and a film with sex scenes in, and that article is about making the last twilight film with sex scenes in as its in the book..
 
 
Maybe the acting will be better in a porno version?

Hobo Face

I rest my case.
 
 
I'd watch it. I can't see Miss Stewart being very good in a porn film, though. She'd have that same vacant "duh" stare like she always does anyway. She's more interesting as Bella in Twilight, and that's saying something.
 
 
I hope it culminates in the Werewolf guy flat-out bricking in Pattinson's mouth.

Just like every Twilight/Robert Pattinson fan. The media has brainwashed them its so ******* unbelievable.
 
 
There probably should be a few sex scenes in Breaking Dawn. It's not really fair on all the girls making them sit through 3 or 4 films (BD is going to be split into 2 films) and then not giving them a sex scene. Mrs Meyers did that in the book and it was rather annoying. Read 3 and bit books full of sexual tension, a massive build up to their marriage night and then there's no sex scene!  
OK, they also have sex when Bella has got her sparkles but there's no description, just Bella musing that they never need to stop  

Although the thought of Rpattz and KStewart doing a sex scene is rather gross.

Not as gross, however, as Nessie's birth. And Jacob tops the gross factor in Breaking Dawn. The whole imprinting on a baby thing. OMG  
 
 
This is good, people.

The disco-ball sparkling will permanently blind all the Twilighters.
 
 
I wish Twilight was a little bit more R rated...
