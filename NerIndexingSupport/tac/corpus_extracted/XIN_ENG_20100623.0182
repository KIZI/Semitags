Twelve opposition parties gathering in what they termed the Alliance des
Démocrates pour le Changement, ADC, said Wednesday that they will not recognize
the candidate elected in the June 28 presidential elections.

In a press conference organised by the ADC, spokesman Léonard Nyangoma said "we
will never accept a president from unconstitutional elections. It will be an
illegitimate president."

"The presidential elections to be held on June 28 with the ruling Conseil
National pour la Défense de la Démocratie–Forces de Défense de la
Démocratie (CNDD-FDD) candidate Pierre Nkurunziza as the only candidate will be
held in violation of the constitution and electoral code," the opposition
spokesman said.

He said the opposition will use force and everything possible "to combat
dictatorship."

Burundi has entered a four-month electoral period. After the May 24 communal
elections whose results have been rejected by the opposition, the next one is
the presidential election due on June 28.

Burundi's current President Pierre Nkurunziza of the ruling CNDD- FDD is the
only candidate for the presidential poll after the pull out of six opposition
candidates who are alleging fraud in the communal elections.

The presidential elections will be followed by the election of deputies due on
July 23. The fourth poll will be that of senators and is due on July 28 and the
last one is the village-based election which will be held on Sept. 7.
