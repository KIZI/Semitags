The Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts took the lead in organizing inter-
ministerial workshop on transforming Cambodia into an international film making
country, the official news agency reported on Tuesday.

Identifying strategic activities to attract film makers into Cambodia grounding
on the country's richness of cultural and natural attractions was the key
purpose of the workshop, Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts' Secretary of State
Som Sokun was quoted by AKP (Agence Kampuchea Presse) as saying.

Representatives from the Ministry of Commerce, the Apsara Authority, the
Ministry of Tourism, the Ministry of Economy and Finance, film productions, the
Phnom Penh Municipality, the French Development Agency (AFD) and the Cambodian
Film Commission (CFC) participated in the workshop.

A committee has been formed to implement the defined strategic activities from
the workshop.

As per their discussion, the more film makers attracted to Cambodia, the better
opportunities will be opened. In other words, film making will give Cambodians
some job opening and bring up demand for related local materials and services
for the production and the crews. Also the films made will increase the number
of tourists to Cambodia.

The AFD representative stressed that not only will the success of this
initiative contribute to Cambodia's cultural development but also its economic
growth.
