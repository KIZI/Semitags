European Union states that have hiked deficits in order to combat recession must
balance their budgets as quickly as possible, a senior European Commission
official said Friday.

"The stimulus packages are financed by additional debt and we have excessive
deficits now," European Union vice-president Gunter Verheugen told the XIX
Krynica Economic Forum in this southern Polish mountain resort, known as the
"Davos of the East."

"We must have balanced budgets as soon as possible," Verheugen said.

The crisis response must "not jeopardise the long-term objectives of the
European Union" to become a "knowledge-based economy" meeting low carbon
targets, the senior European Commission official said.

"In order to position the European Union on the higher end of the value chain...
new spending priorities are needed," Verheugen said.

"This does not always mean that we have to spend more money. We need to put more
emphasis on money we spend on education, research..." he added.

"The economy is no longer in free-fall. We have stabilisation, but definitely at
a much lower level," than before the crisis, he said.
