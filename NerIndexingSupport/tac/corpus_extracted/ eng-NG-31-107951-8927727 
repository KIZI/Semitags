If there's one thing that has been brought to the forefront of cycling is
that the UCI, WADA and USADA are crooked and in bed with each other.

There is no way to maintain the slightest veracity if you cannot trust your
own laboratories and the case against Floyd demonstrated that without the
slightest fog of question.

It is time for the United States to leave the UCI completely. What's more,
we need to completely overhaul the USA Cycling needs to be dumped and a
completely new organization needs to be built that eliminates any possible
connection to USADA and the Olympic fraud being perpetrated on the US
cycling scene.
