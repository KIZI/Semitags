Vikings by 40, I say.
 
 
Toro, I see you've been   again along with the wacky   but that's ok, delusion is good on a Saturday night!  
 
 
Maybe the Cowboys are going to win a playoff game. Gotta do that before they can get at anybody else.
 
 
I predict a Staubach to Pearson Hail Mary, with a Nate Wright screw-up, to win the game.

The fact that I've had about 4 hours sleep in 3 days has nothing to do with my football prognostications.

My hand. So

many

pretty colors
 
 
Another Eagle fumble. Cowboy fans are starting show signs of soon-to-be hysteria.

ahhhh the play that incited my eternal hatred for the Cowboys and the ref who didn't make the offensive pass interference call.
 
 
Vikings 8-0 at home, 700 yards and 61 points in 60 minutes during the 2nd half against the Bears and the 1st half against the Giants.

I can't wait.

It also marked the first a whiskey bottle and an orange were mentioned in the same sentence.

her husband's a member of the illuminati, too?
 
 
52 seconds to go. Edit: it's over.
 
 
Brett Favre, Adrian Peterson, Sidney Rice, and Percy Harvin. The Cowboys don't have much hope for winning this one.

Disagree---I bet it's close. Dallas seems to be pulling it together

Yeah. KInda like the Eagles by 40, right?

Migh as well. Same shit.

Dude, NON+BODY is more critical of the Cowboys than me. From Don Meredith t date. If there's a way to choke, they will.

Not looking like it this year, though. Sorry if that doesn't work for you.  
 
 
No one can argue that the 'boys have not a history of being the ultimate choke artists. Still... and all... the last four weeks they have looked like Aikman, Smith, and Irvin and gang. I hope they continue.

Listen to you talking about choking when you're one of the winningest playoff franchises in history.

How many Super Bowls do you have?

Yeah, that's what I thought.

No one takes away the choke reference from Philadelphia, least of all the Cowboys

How many Superbowls and no wins is it?      
You DO have a point....

I am holding a nickel in my hand. That is exactly 5 cents more than I am betting on this game...

if the Bears can beat them, anyone has a chance.

Vikings, avenge me! Avenge me!  
 
 
On any given Sunday!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The Boys are back in town. Now if they can just stay for the ride.

Following that play, beer sold in glass bottles was banned from NFL stadiums. Plastic cups and plastic bottles won't kill referees when thrown.

I would say Zulu was the one boozing and delusional that night thinking The Cowgirls would actually win.   this thread needs to be brought back since we have another rematch.it will be the same result of course.   Face it cowgirls fans,The Cowgirls just dont have a quality head coach.

Drew Pearson still blatantly pushed off.

The way the Cowgirls have been playing, the Vikes could win even if Bob Lee was the QB.
 
 
Well same story.It pretty much went the way I expected it to go with The Vikings winning but being a much closer game like I thought it would be.
