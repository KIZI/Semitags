US Open semi-finalist Yanina Wickmayer and her Belgian compatriot Xavier Malisse
on Monday had their one-year doping bans provisionally lifted by a Belgian
court.

Wickmayer, the world number 18, was suspended in November by the Flemish Doping
Tribunal (VDT) for failing to fulfill the 'whereabouts' rule while Malisse was
also punished for missing a drugs test.

While Monday's ruling allows them to return to the court, the pair could face
further disciplinary procedures including one instigated by the World Anti-
Doping Agency (WADA).

"I'm really happy, but there's a major question mark over my participation at
the Australian Open (in January), as the entries are already closed," Wickmayer
told Belgian radio station Studio Brussel.

She added: "I will have to count on an invitation from the organisers, I dont
know whether they are going to give it to me."
