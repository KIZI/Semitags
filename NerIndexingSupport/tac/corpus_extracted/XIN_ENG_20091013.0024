The Israel Cancer Association ( ICA) said Tuesday that the survival rate of
cancer patients in Israel is among the highest in the world, local daily The
Jerusalem Post reported on its website.

The ICA revealed data of its activities in conjunction with Israeli Health
Ministry and national health services during a press conference, ahead of a
nationwide donation campaign to be held next Monday.

According to the data, 61.4 percent of Jewish men and 67.3 percent of Jewish
women survive at least five years from the moment they are diagnosed as being
sick with cancer. In the Israeli-Arab sector, 50.7 percent of men and 64.9
percent of women survive at least five years.

Micha Barhana, who maintains records of cancer patients in Israel in the Health
Ministry, was quoted as saying that Israel is positioned higher than the United
States, Finland, Italy, Norway and other countries regarding such rate.

"One of the most influential factors regarding the chances of survival is the
stage in which the disease is discovered. Public awareness, early diagnosis and
new technologies all affect the diagnosis of cancer," said Barhana.
