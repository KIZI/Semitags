If this is true, then I'm wondering why it has taken so very long to capture him.

I'm also wondering (with considerable concern) about what the reaction to this news will be from the more aggressive fundamentalist Muslim leaders.

Took so long because people aiding and protecting Bin Laden were loyal enough not even to be moved by a 25 million dollar reward. Also, the hills of Afghanistan and pakistan are notoriously treacherous to get around in - it wasn't like they could just go in with a raid and take him whenever.
 
 
Yup those are my two thoughts right now. Will there be immediate terrorist retaliation, and how many hundreds of thousands of young American soldiers enlisted just because of what bin Laden set into motion.
 
 
@snood,

Yes, I know that many were loyal to him, snood.
Apparently his death (I think, from that brief report? Correct me, someone, if I'm wrong here, please.) was the result of a drone attack ?

US president Barack Obama is due to make a statement shortly in which he is expected to announce the death of Osama bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaeda.

Obama's address was due at 0300GMT from the White House.

Qais Azimy, Al Jazeera's correspondent in Kabul, said that Afghan officials have confirmed that Bin Laden had died and that his body was with the United States.

Officials would not confirm whether he had been killed in Afghanistan or Pakistan, and said that the death of the al-Qaeda leader was more of a "symbolic victory", as he was no longer directly connected to the group's field operations, Azimy reported.
 
 
 
Now they're saying he was killed in a mansion outside of Islamabad.
 
 
@msolga,

I heard it was not a drone attack. He was shot in the head.

The way I'm hearing it, it wasn't an unmanned attack, but the death came as the result of an armed mission with boots on the ground.

Al-Qaeda leader Bin Laden 'dead'

Al-Qaeda founder and leader Osama Bin Laden is dead, according to US media reports citing officials.

The US is in possession of Bin Laden's body, the reports say. President Barack Obama is due to make a statement shortly.

Mr Bin Laden is top of the US most wanted list.

He is accused of being behind a number of atrocities, including the attacks on New York and Washington on 11 September 2001.

How many "official sources" were wrong, confirming within the hour that the strike was a drone, last week, in Afghanistan?

Who cares... let's celebrate!

I'm good with that.
 
 
Big crowd gathering around the White House to celebrate...chanting USA USA.
 
 
Partial transcript - more in a few minutes.

"Justice has been done," the president declared as crowds formed outside the White House to celebrate, singing "The Star-Spangled Banner" and "We Are the Champions," NBC News reported.

Obama said bin Laden, whom he called a terrorist "responsible for the murder of thousands of American men, women and children," was killed in Pakistan earlier in the day after a firefight in an operation that was based on U.S. intelligence.

Officials long believed that bin Laden, the most wanted man in the world, was hiding a mountainous region along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.

It is a major accomplishment for Obama and his national security team, having fulfilled the goal once voiced by Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush, to bring to justice the mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks.

Obama declared that "the death of bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our nation's struggle to defeat al-Qaida," he stressed that the effort continues.

"We must and we will remain vigilant at home and abroad," he said, while emphasizing that "the United States is not and never will be at war with Islam."
 
 
@plainoldme,

 
I honestly think things will get worse now.

 

You may be right. No way to know but wait and see. Some say al Qaeda (however the hell it's spelled) wasn't really the main engine behind the majority of Islamic terriorism, anyway. It'll be something to keep us on our toes for a while...
 
 
I'm glad it's done, and it sounds like quite capably so.
I'll wish for the best re further developments.
 
 
GWB: “ The fight against terror goes on, but tonight America has sent an unmistakable message: No matter how long it takes, justice will be done.”

Excerpt:

 
US celebrations

As the news of bin Laden's death spread, crowds gathered outside the White House in Washington to celebrate.

Former US president George Bush called his death a "momentous achievement".

"The fight against terror goes on, but tonight America has sent an unmistakable message: No matter how long it takes, justice will be done," Bush said in a statement.

According to Al Jazeeera's Rosalind Jordan in Washington, the operation had been in the making for the last 9 or 10 months.

"The fact that it happened inside Pakistan, there have been suggestions that Pakistani intelligence may have been protecting them," she said.

Reporting from Pakistan, Al Jazeera's Kamal Hyder said the development had caught a lot of people by surprise.

"He was considered by many as a hero, but not to the extent that people would come out on the streets. The reaction so far not likely to be strong on the streets, perhaps a protest here or there by the religious parties,." he said.

I don't know, we almost have to. We can ride the wave, bring em home, tell the world the job is done. Get your shit together folks cause you harbor terrorists well be back. Wouldn't that give us some much needed credibility?
Sure, it's a risk, but matbe a risk we need to take to stat on top.
 
 
@Butrflynet,

 
It will also be interesting to watch the reaction in Congress as the US government admits they've taken unauthorized military action across the border in Pakistan.
 

Yes I would love to see the GOP crying about killing the sob because we annoy Pakistan who had at least some people in their government who must had been aiding him as he was in the middle of the damn country in a mansion.
 
 
I agree with POM, in that I think it's pretty likely thatsomebody is already planning a series of revenge attacks on us because of this. But I also think it was something we had to do regardless.
 
 
@MontereyJack,

 
pretty likely thatsomebody is already planning a series of revenge attacks
 

An they would not be planning attacks if we did not kill him?
 
 
@MontereyJack,

This was my first (posted) response when I heard the news. (page 1 of this thread)
I'm hoping that the response to the news of Bin Laden's death in the US is, well... rather more restrained, rather than too celebratory.
That, I fear, could inspire retaliatory responses from his supporters, who could feel the need to demonstrate that the movement continues, despite his death.
For many Islamicists, he is a revered figure.
I'm certain his death will be greeted by intense grief. Let's hope revenge is not part of the response as well.

@kuvasz,

No doubt the killing of Bin Laden will give Obama a considerable boost in the polls.

But (& I'm sorry to sound like a wet blanket, or something) the repercussions of his death, if his followers do choose to retaliate, are likely to impact on far more than just the US. We could well see retaliation/revenge attacks in any number of "allied" countries. This is not just about US domestic politics.
 
 
I note that the message is out that Bin Laden's body will be treated in accordance with Islamic tradition. Nice touch.
 
 
@hingehead,

That is a huge relief to hear, hinge.
There would be widespread Islamic outrage, otherwise.
 
 
@msolga,

He orchestrated the killing of 2000 of my countrymen. Do you expect us to take that passively, because his angry supporters might blow up a train in Madrid or London - oh, wait, they have done that already. Do you really think that passivity will deter folks like that? Do you have any historical evidence with which to support that notion? (I think not.) Did British PM Chamberlain deter Hitler from his aggression by betraying the Czechs at Munich and playing nice with the tyrant?

Do you really believe we are endangering anyone else by killing him? If so who?
 
 
Nice timing, really....considering how old he was and the bad health he was in...they couldnt keep him "alive" for too much longer.  

Strange how they found him surrounded by the Pakistan military.

Strange how a 6'4" world's number one wanted man made it through all those check points that far into Pakistan.

Or he was dead for years and they chose now to tell everyone in the hope of influencing the upcoming elections in the Arab world.
 
 
Okay, I did the transcript myself since it was taking so long for news organizations to produce it.

For Soz and others:

Youtube:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-N3dJvhgPg 

"Good Evening, Tonight I can report to the American people and to the world, that the United States has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden the leader of Al Qaeda and a terrorist who is responsible for the murder of thousands of innocent men, women, and children.

It was nearly ten years ago that a bright day was darkened by the worst attack on the American people in our history. The images of 9/11 are seared into our national memory, hijacked planes cutting through a cloudless September sky and the twin towers collapsing to the ground, black smoke billowing up from the Pentagon, the wreckage of flight 93 in Shankesville, Pennsylvania where the actions of heroic citizens saved even more heart break and destruction.

And yet we know that the worst images were those that were unseen to the world. the empty seat at the table, children who were forced to grow up without their mother or father, parents who would never know the feeling of their child's embrace. Nearly 3,000 citizens taken from us leaving a gaping hole in our hearts.

On September 11t, 2001, in our time of grief, the American people came together, we offered our neighbors a hand and we offered the wounded our blood. We reaffirmed our ties to each other and our we and our love of community and country. On that day, no matter where we came from, what god we prayed to, or what race or ethnicity we were, we were united as one American family. We were also united in our resolve to protect our nation and to bring those who committed this viscous attack to justice.

We quickly learned that the attacks were carried out by Al Qaeda, an organization headed by Osama bin Laden which had openly declared war on the United States and was committed to killing innocents in our country and around the globe... and so we went to war against Al Qaeda to protect our citizens, our friends and our allies.

Over the last ten years thanks to the tireless and heroic work of our military and our counter terrorism professionals, we have made great strides in that effort. We have disrupted terrorist attacks and strengthened our homeland defense. In Afghanistan we removed the Taliban government which had given bin Laden and Al Qaeda safe haven and support. Around the globe we have worked with our friend and allies to capture or kill scores of Al Qaeda terrorists, including several that were a part of the 9/11 plot.

Yet Osama Bin Laden avoided capture and escaped across the Afghan border into Pakistan. Meanwhile Al Qaeda continued to operate from along that border and operate through its affiliates across the world.

And so shortly after taking office I directed Leon Panetta, the director of the CIA, to make the killing or capture of Osama Bin Laden the top priority of our war against Al Qaeda, even as we continued our broader efforts to disrupt, dismantle and defeat his network.

Then, last August, after years of painstaking work by our intelligence community, I was briefed on a possible lead to bin Laden. It was far from certain and took many months to run this thread to ground. I met repeatedly with my national security team as we developed more information about the possibility that we had located bin Laden hiding within a compound deep inside Pakistan. Finally, last week, I determined that we had enough intelligence to take action and authorized an operation to get Osama bin Laden and bring him to justice.

Today at my direction the US launched a targeted operation against that compound in Abadabad, Pakistan. A small team of Americans carried out the operation with extraordinary courage and capability. No Americans were harmed. They took care to avoid civilian casualties. After a firefight they killed Osama Bin Laden and took custody of his body.

For over two decades Bin Laden has been Al Qaeda's leader and symbol and has continued to plot attacks against our country and our friends and allies. The death of bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our nation's effort to defeat Al Qaeda. Yet, his death does not mark the end of our effort. There is no doubt that Al Qaeda will continue to pursue attacks against us. We must and we will remain vigilant at home and abroad. As we do, we must also reaffirm that the United States is not and never will be at war with Islam. I have made clear just as President Bush did shortly after 9/11, that our war is not against Islam. Bin Laden was not a Muslim leader. He was a mass murderer of Muslims. Indeed, Al Qaeda has slaughtered scores of Muslims in many countries including our own. So, his demise should be welcomed by all who believe in peace and human dignity. Over the years I have repeatedly made clear that we would take action within Pakistan if we knew where bin Laden was. That is what we've done, but it is important to note that our counter terrorism cooperation with Pakistan helped lead us to bin Laden and the compound where he was hiding. Indeed, bin Laden had declared war against Pakistan as well and ordered attacks against the Pakistani people.

Tonight, I called President Zadari and my team has also spoken with their Pakistani counterparts. They agree that this is a good and historic day for both of our nations and going forward, it is essential that Pakistan continue to join us in the fight against Al Qaeda and its affiliates.

The American people did not choose this fight, it came to our shores and started with the senseless slaughter of our citizens. After nearly 10 years of service, struggle and sacrifice, we know well the costs of war. These efforts weigh on me every time I, as Commander in Chief, have to sign a letter to a family that has lost a loved one or look into the eyes of a service member who has been gravely wounded. So, Americans understand the costs of war, yet as a country we will never tolerate our security being threatened and stand idling by while our people have been killed. We will be relentless in defense of our citizens and our friends and allies. We will be true to the values that make us who we are and nights like this one we can say to those families who have lost loved ones to Al Qaeda's terror, tonight we can say, justice has been done.

Tonight we give thanks to the countless intelligence and counter terrorism professionals who have worked tirelessly to achieve this outcome. The American people do not see their work nor know their names, but tonight they feel the satisfaction of their work and the result of their pursuit of justice. We give thanks for the men who carried out this operation for they exemplify the professionalism, patriotism and unparalleled courage of those who serve our country. They are part of a generation that has born the heaviest share of the burden since that September day.

Finally, let me say to the families who lost loved ones on 9/11 that we have never forgotten your loss nor waivered in our commitment to see that we do whatever it takes to prevent another attack on our shores. Tonight let us think back to the sense of unity that prevailed on 9/11. I know that it has at times frayed, yet today's achievement is a testament to the greatness of our country and the determination of the American people. The cause of securing our country is not complete but tonight we are once again reminded that America can do whatever we set our mind to, that is the story of our history whether it is the pursuit of prosperity for our people, or the struggle for equality for all our citizens, our commitment to stand up for our values abroad, and our sacrifices to make the world a safer place. Let us remember that we can do these things not just because of wealth or power but because of who we are, one nation, under god, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. Thank you, may god bless you and may god bless the United States of America.

Oh oh!
 
 
@georgeob1,

Any number of countries which have actively supported the US-inspired "war against terror", George. (Including my own country.)

At this point in time I am simply hoping for this madness to stop, from both sides.
There has been more than enough death & suffering of innocent people from this "war".
Far more civilian deaths than the 2000 of your countrymen....in Iraq, for example.
My concern is about all the completely unnecessary civilian deaths, no matter which country.
These crazy ideology wars hurt civilians the most.
 
 
@georgeob1,

Not to put words in Olga's mouth, but I don't think she's commenting on the rightness or wrongness of the action, just what the consequences might be.
 
 
@hingehead,

Exactly, hinge.
 
 
Okay, let's speculate about it...

I heard a news reporter saying that bin Laden had probably planted terror cells here for the express purpose of retaliating against us in the event of his death - in fact, that he had been planning and preparing those cells for all these almost 10 years...

We can only hope that our heightened intelligence operations have been tracking those cells and won't be caught as unprepared as we would have been 10 years ago.
 
 
@snood,

CSPAN just had someone from Al Jazeera on a few minutes ago, basically saying the same thing -- that there are some long-term sleeper cells who will probably now become active.

And it looks like it is being taken seriously:

Area Bases Expecting Heightened Security After Bin Laden's Death
By WCTI Staff

UPDATED: 1:31 am EDT May 2, 2011
EASTERN NC -- Shortly after President Barack Obama announced the death of Osama bin Laden, military bases in eastern North Carolina raised their security measures.

It might take extra time for base personnel to get through gates on Monday, authorities said.

From Camp Lejeune's website:
The Commander, U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) has directed all DoD forces and activities including Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune and Marine Corps Air Station New River to assume Force Protection Condition BRAVO. Base personnel should expect delays at gate entrances and heightened security activities associated with this condition.

Osama killing: US issues worldwide travel alert
WASHINGTON: The United States today issued a worldwide travel alert for its citizens, especially those living in Pakistan, soon after President Barack Obama announced that Al Qaeda leader Osama bin-Laden has been killed in an operation outside Islamabad.

"The US Department of State alerts US citizens travelling and residing abroad to the enhanced potential for anti-American violence given recent counter-terrorism activity in Pakistan," the travel alert said.

US forces killed bin Laden in a special operation in Abbottabad this morning.

Given the uncertainty and volatility of the current situation, US citizens in areas where recent events could cause anti-American violence are strongly urged to limit their travel outside of their homes and hotels and avoid mass gatherings and demonstrations, the alert said.

US citizens should stay current with media coverage of local events and be aware of their surroundings at all times, the travel alert said.

The State Department said the US Embassy operations in affected areas will continue to the extent possible under the constraints of any evolving security situation.

"US government facilities worldwide remain at a heightened state of alert. These facilities may temporarily close or periodically suspend public services to assess their security posture," it said.

"In those instances, US Embassies and Consulates will make every effort to provide emergency services to US citizens.US citizens abroad are urged to monitor the local news and maintain contact with the nearest US Embassy or Consulate," the statement said.

Cynical me thanks that when a reporter says "probably", he's divorcing himself from sources and looking for lines of print. It's about equavalent to me saying that if the could take a particular action now, they "probably" would have already done so.

I'm really sorry, roger, but I can't be sure that I've figured out what you actually mean in that post.

I was afraid of that. What I should have said is, he made it up to get himself attention. By saying 'probably', he relieves himself of any obligation of proof.

Remember the old Abuzz question. "Is Ricky Martin gay?" See, the guy doesn't have to defend the statement because all he did was ask an innocent question.

It does seem weird that Bin Laden would hold back Al Qaeda's jihad resources to avenge his death (to the point that terrorist attacks seem limited to Iraq and Afghanistan - involving 12 year old boys with bombs strapped to them :-( - ) rather than continually targeting high profile western targets, for what? Five years now?

Has the spate of popular uprisings in the Arab world mollified, to a degree, the mounting frustrations in that part of the world about western backed dictatorial governments that originally inspired Bin Laden?

Hell, I hope its true that the lack of attacks over the last 10 years means we gained serious ground as far as prevention. I just thought everyone was now going to speculate about what kinds of terrible things might happen, so I thought I'd join in the prognostication of doom.
 
 
@snood,

 
I was simply sharing something I had heard amongst all the babbling by all the many reporters this evening. No, I don't have a link. Is there some rule we need a link before we can join in the speculating?
 

No, there isn't any "rule".
It just helps, if a person makes a statement about something about "terror cells" (which can be quite alarming to many people), that they have something more to back it up than mere speculation.

It certainly appears that Bin Laden has been largely retired for some time, that todays events are more like getting Eichmann than getting the Unibomber.
 
 
WARNING! Picture of dead Osama Bin Laden. DO NOT OPEN if you do not want to see it, it is graphic.
According to Times of Malta site, Pakistani television stations have broadcast what they described as unconfirmed images of Osama bin Laden's bloodied face after the United States said he had been killed.

Pakistani television stations have broadcast what they described as unconfirmed images of Osama bin Laden's bloodied face after the United States said he had been killed.

"The picture of Osama bin Laden's dead body has been released. It is unverified," said the commentator on Pakistan's largest TV network, Geo.

Other channels also showed the image of a face, which sported a bushy and black beard without any visible traces of the white or grey detected in the most recent video footage of bin Laden when he was alive.

There were extensive blood stains on the forehead and left temple. The right eye was shut but the whites of the left eye were visible.

The hair was mangled and the mouth was slightly open with teeth showing.

 
 
 
@snood,

Hi Snood - wasn't arguing with you, and join you on the prognostication - I hope I'm right, but I haven't convinced myself at all. Terrorism only takes one nutjob, not an international organisation. There could be retaliation from Bin Laden fans who've never done more than buy Al Qaeda lottery tickets in the past.
 
 
@hawkeye10,

I hope so Hawk. But single nutjobs might still be 'inspired', particularly if they've just lost a job, wife's burned the dinner, and the football team lost.

@Butrflynet,

Couldn't bring myself to do the ghoulish click, but it does raise an interesting point - how do they verify that it is Bin Laden?
 
 
@Butrflynet,

That reminds me of the famous photograph of Che Guevara, as proof of death of the revolutionary.
 
Though Che Guevara's death photograph was much more serene... which makes me wonder if it was doctored. Death by such methods is surely not pretty.
So I wonder what Osama Bin Laden's supporters are supposed to make of his death photograph?
 
 
Can't help thinking about the 72 virgins.
 
 
@Jeremiah,

Yes, it does indeed sound like he's dead, Jeremiah.
I haven't disputed that.
 
 
@hingehead,

 
Can't help thinking about the 72 virgins.
 

Why?  
I'd suspect that they were the least of his concerns
 
 
@hingehead,

 
Couldn't bring myself to do the ghoulish click, but it does raise an interesting point - how do they verify that it is Bin Laden?

 
Genetics I bet, it is well known that some family members had turned against him and were cooperating with the Americans, comparing the DNA from the body to the known Bin Laden family DNA will be the final test. In the mean time they have marks, and some known dental records.
 
 
@hawkeye10,

Hmm, I think I'd trust dental records slightly more than DNA - no guarantees that family members are actually family members, if you know what I mean...
 
 
@msolga,

Just thinking about that standard line about islamic martyrs getting preferential treatment in heaven - not being serious at all just in thoughtsparking mode.
 
 
@hingehead,

Ah.
OK then.
 
 
@hingehead,

 
Hmm, I think I'd trust dental records slightly more than DNA - no guarantees that family members are actually family members, if you know what I mean...

 
Nobody knows about work that has been done over the last years. I'd be curious to know what is the most recent that they have.

What next after bin Laden death?
Osama bin Laden's death is politically momentous for the US, but may not sound death knell for al-Qaeda.
Gregg Carlstrom Last Modified: 02 May 2011 06:30

Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden’s death is politically momentous for US president Barack Obama - witness the cheering crowds which gathered outside the White House even before his speech on Sunday night.

Its impact on al-Qaeda, though, is harder to measure.

Peter Bergen, an American journalist, said on CNN that bin Laden’s death marked “the end of the war on terror". But many other analysts would disagree: Al-Qaeda, after all, is a very different organisation in 2011 than in 2001, with a new cadre of leaders and a wider range of affiliate groups.

Analysts have long debated the extent to which bin Laden - and his deputy, Egyptian-born Ayman al-Zawahiri - direct al-Qaeda’s operations. The two men have largely been in hiding since September 11, 2001, attacks on the US, leaving their subordinates to handle many of the group’s day-to-day operations. Affiliate groups, like al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, already operate with relatively little direction from the “leadership” on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.

“It is often assumed that their principal roles, particularly in bin Laden’s case, are as propaganda leaders or even mere figureheads,” said Barbara Sude, a former CIA al-Qaeda analyst, in a policy paper released last year.

Indeed, a series of younger leaders - some of them now deceased - emerged to play leading roles in the group over the past few years, broadening its leadership. They include Abu al-Yazid; Abu Yahya al-Libi; and Atiyah abd al-Rahman.

If bin Laden is only a figurehead, then one could argue that he has already served his purpose: His ideology and strategy has permeated throughout al-Qaeda, both the central organisation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and its affiliate groups elsewhere.

“This is an enormous blow to the jihadi network in multiple ways, but it does not kill al-Qaeda,” said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, director of the Centre for the Study of Terrorist Radicalisation at the Washington-based Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. “The jihadi group possesses other leaders who can step in to serve as figureheads for the group.”

Bin Laden’s death, in other words - while symbolically significant - may mean little for al-Qaeda’s capabilities.

'Catastrophic if it is authentic'

Reaction from al-Qaeda and its sympathisers has so far been muted. The group’s propaganda wing has not yet issued a video tribute to bin Laden, nor has it commented on the reports of his death.

On internet forums sympathetic to al-Qaeda, a majority of commentators seem shocked by the reports of bin Laden’s death.

In the past, when US officials announced the death of high-ranking al-Qaeda members, commentators often rejected those reports out of hand. But the latest announcement by Obama, on the other hand, seems to be viewed as somewhat more credible.

“If it is true then we must thank Allah that America was not able to capture him alive,” one commentator wrote. “Else they would be humiliating him like Saddam Hussein.”

“God willing, news is not true. Catastrophic if it is authentic,” another wrote.

The US state department issued a worldwide travel alert for American citizens, and the US military increased its “force protection” level, which measures threats to military bases. A senior administration official said there were no specific threats reported, though.

'No other country was informed'

One pressing question is what bin Laden’s death means for the already strained US-Pakistani relationship. The two countries have clashed publicly in recent months over US drone strikes in northwest Pakistan and over the case of Raymond Davis, the CIA contractor arrested for murder in Lahore and then released after “blood money” was paid to the families of his victims.

Obama had in the past praised the Pakistani government for its co-operation in the hunt for bin Laden. And some officials in the ISI, Pakistan’s spy agency, reportedly played a role in his eventual killing, according to media reports.

But the White House quickly rejected that claim: In a conference call on Sunday night, a senior administration official told reporters that Pakistan was not briefed in advance on the operation which led to bin Laden’s death.

“An operation like this has the utmost operational security attached to it,” the official said. “No other country was informed, and a small circle of people within the United States knew about it.”

Obama, in offering praise for Pakistan, also seemed to admonish the country’s leadership, calling it “essential that Pakistan continue to join us in the fight against al-Qaeda". Other administration officials went further, describing bin Laden’s long hideout in Pakistan as a cause for concern and a potential source of friction in the relationship.

“We are very concerned about the situation in Pakistan… but this is something we need to work with the Pakistani government on,” a senior official said.

Also unclear is whether bin Laden’s death will have any impact on the war in Afghanistan, now in its tenth year. Obama did not mention any changes to strategy during his speech; bin Laden was killed in Pakistan, not Afghanistan; and US officials admit that only a handful of al-Qaeda members remain in Afghanistan.

In other words, the war - started to punish the perpetrators of the September 11 attacks - may well outlast the architect of those attacks.

Islamabad: Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden's six children and two wives have been arrested in Pakistan, a media report said.

Osama bin Laden was killed on Monday in a security operation in Pakistan's Abbotabad city, less than 100 km from the Pakistan capital.

Sources said Osama's six children, two wives and four close friends were arrested during a search operation launched early Monday morning by the Pakistani forces in a mountainous area located some 60 km north of Pakistan's capital Islamabad, Xinhua quoted Dunya TV as saying.

KABUL - Afghan President Hamid Karzai called on the Taliban on Monday to refrain from fighting after the killing of al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden and said the Taliban must learn a lesson from his death.

Karzai described the killing of bin Laden by U.S. special forces north of the Pakistani capital Islamabad as "important news".

"The Taliban must learn a lesson from this. The Taliban should refrain from fighting," Karzai told a nationally televised news conference.

With Bin Laden out, expats in Kingdom hope for end to terror killings

By MOHAMMED RASOOLDEEN | ARAB NEWS

Published: May 2, 2011 10:11 Updated: May 2, 2011 10:11

RIYADH: A cross section of expatriates working in Saudi Arabia have expressed their sense of relief over the American mission that killed Al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden in Pakistan on Monday. They were unanimous in their condemnation of terrorist activities of any kind, and were hopeful that with the killing of the mastermind there would be some letup in these senseless killings.

Mohammed Ali, Sri Lankan expatriate in the Kingdom said: "We woke up for a good news on Monday morning about the killing of Bin Laden. It has put an end to terror and his nefarious activities carried out by this leader."

Dwight Fullingim, an American working in the capital told Arab News that he has mixed feelings of happiness and sympathy for Bin Laden. "I am glad that he is down and no more terror under his leadership. On the other hand, I feel sorry for this boy who hailed from a good family and religion brought discredit to both his family and religion. It’s a tragedy."

Tariq Soomro, a prominent Pakistani businessman in the Kingdom said that all bad things have come to an end with Bin Laden's death. "He brought shame to our religion. My country suffered a lot from intrusion of foreign soldiers who were after his blood," Soomro said, adding that there will be peace in Pakistan and hoped that the foreign troops who came to kill him would wrap up their tour to Pakistan and people could live peacefully.

"The news of Osama Bin Laden's death came to me early morning today, as a bit of surprise and disbelief," Faiz Al- Najdi, Pakistani engineer in Riyadh said.

“In my personal opinion, Bin Laden was an evil-minded person who, by his ill-advised terrorist acts, brought shame and dishonor to entire Muslims. He tarnished the image of our great religion Islam which teaches peace and coexistence.

"He and his associates, by their terrorist acts, did not serve any purpose except that they provided the golden opportunity to everybody to unjustly target Muslims, Islam and our beloved Prophet Muhammad – PBUH," Al-Najdi said.

"Muslims in general are peace-loving and Islam is a peaceful religion. However, only because of him and his associates, the Muslims of all nationality suffered in many ways, including suspicion, mistrust and even humiliations, in the Western countries especially in the United States. The Muslim students, travelers and even the Muslim nationals suffered in these Western countries because of his actions."

"I hope and pray, with Osama Bin Laden is now gone, the honor, respect and trust of the Muslims, through out the World, would be restored and the Glory of our peaceful religion Islam would also be redeemed, amen!" Al- Najdi added.

A senior diplomat from a foreign mission, who wished to be anonymous, said the killing is a major breakthrough in antiterror activities.
 
 
 
@Butrflynet,

 
Osama's six children, two wives held in Pakistan
 
That, plus the fact that Osama was hiding in a mansion leads me to believe that he has been fully protected by the Pakistani's, but they decided to turn on him. Best guess is that Pakistan knows that they are in deep trouble now that India is on a $50 billion rapid improvement of their military, and so Pakistan needs American military hardware again. Be ready to hear with-in the year that we are selling a large amount, as payment for services rendered.
 
 
@hawkeye10,

There is a possibility that ISI were protecting Bin Laden and the govt was powerless.
 
 
@hawkeye10,

Welt is reporting that Osama had had his three wives, 7 sons, 4 associates and guards with him on the compound....he was not living in the caves, that is for sure. There is no way that the Pakistan military did not know that he was there.

@hingehead,

That is a given, it was the ISI that set him up and then turned him in (they were even on the kill mission). What we dont know for sure is why, but my assumption that it was to get military gear is 90% probable.
 
 
@hawkeye10,

Another thing that I will be watching for is any indication that China played a role....they have a serious desire to hurt India these days, and have become Pakistan's new best friend...they well may have decided to throw the US a bone and help us get Osama by pressuring the ISI to give him up.
 
 
Now, here is the oddest thing. I received this alert by email:

from The Wall Street Journal

Osama bin Laden has been buried at sea, the Associated Press reported, citing a U.S. official.

After Mr. bin Laden was killed in a raid by U.S. forces in Pakistan, senior administration officials said the body would be handled according to Islamic practice and tradition. That practice calls for the body to be buried within 24 hours, the official said.

Finding a country willing to accept the remains of the world's most wanted terrorist would have been difficult, the official said. So the U.S. decided to bury him at sea.

The official, who spoke Monday on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive national security matters, didn't immediately say where the burial occurred.

I followed the link, read the article, and there was not one word about either burial at sea or a need to dispose of the body within 24 hours. What the heck is going on?
 
 
@roger,

a need to dispose of the body within 24 hours.

Shame on him for failing where the US, NATO and its allies has spent billions looking for the missing criminal.
 
 
I am happy to see we got him but at the same time there will always be someone else to take his place. That is the unfortunate part of dealing with terrorists.
 
 
damn, there goes my write in vote in todays canadian elections
 
 
First of all congratulations on a job well done. It's a pity Bush couldn't have done this years ago. Then again, with close family links between the Bushes and the Bin Ladens going back years, coupled with a convenient bogeyman, which allowed Bush to pass legislation which takes away the rights of the American people I can see why he didn't bother.

Al Qaida is not one organisation though, it's more of a rallying cry for Islamic extremists. And like the hydra of legend when you cut off one head another three grow. There is a strong possibility of revenge attacks, Bin Laden will be viewed as a martyr, and could be even stronger in death than in life. America has shown its military prowess now it needs to show its commitment to peace.

The foreign minister of Egypt Nabil Al Araby has called upon America to recognise an independent Palestinian state. This has followed the reconcilliation of Fatah and Hamas, which has only occured because Egypt is now acting as an honest broker. Under Mubarak Egypt treated Palestine according to American diktat, and had no real interest in peace and reconciliation. Now there is a nascent democracy that is reflecting the real will of its people, not foreign interests.

America, and the EU need to recognise Palestine straight away. Show the Moslem world that the West is truely interested in peace and democracy. Hamas will not accept Israel's right to exist, but this should not be a barrier to talks. The IRA and Sinn Fein are still committed to a United Ireland. this viewpoint is as inflammatory to an orangeman in Ulster as Hamas' viewpoint is to an Israeli. If we had refused to talk to the IRA until they dropped this aspiration then the Good Friday agreement would never have been signed. God knows how many more people would have died. Now those Irish terrorists are marginalised as the vast majority of the population, and politicians both sides of the divide and the border are fully supportive of the peace process.

Hamas are not like Al Qaida, they are motivated primarily by the desire for national self detetrmination. There's a strong vein of pragmatism that runs through their veins. They have called numerous ceasefires in the past, which have all been kept to until broken by Israel. The only precondition to talks, should be a ceasefire. Once the Palestinian people are no longer subject to daily harrassment reconciliation can begin. Give all those angry young men with plenty of time on their hands something to do. Once people have a taste of peace they won't want to go back.

America and the West is in danger of being on the wrong side of the equation, fighting against the forces of democracy and siding with aggressive dictators and brutal occupiers. It's not in our interests to allow Israel to constantly flout international law, and continue with illegal settlements. If America wants to really defeat terrorism it needs to grasp this nettle now. It doesn't matter how many Osama Bin Ladens you kill, until there is justice for Palestine none of us will be safe from the threat of Islamic terrorism.
 
 
I, for one, don't like to see anyone killed, and I question the right of the US forces to have committed this... act.

As Wayne declared on page one, "that's justice, American style!"

I fear he may be right.
 
 
@Eorl,

Bin Laden and his organization made war on the United States, and did so before 2001. In war, taking out the enemy leadership is a reasonable tactic. Do you think it was wrong for the United States Army Air Force to act on information from broken Imperial Navy codes and shoot down the plane carrying Admiral Yamamoto in 1943? "Justice American style" is pretty damned snide--we are not the only nation to use such tactics.

The only plausible objection i can think of is that it was done in Pakistan, and i personally would consider such an objection nugatory given that Pakistan hosts terrorists, and given that Pakistan's ISI provided material support and leadership in fighting U.S. forces in Waziristan in 2002 and afterward.
 
 
@Setanta,

Osama told his wife last night
"You feed the dog, Ill feed the fish"
 
 
I salute president Obama. You can't argue with success. The widows, widowers, and children of the Americans bin Laden killed on 9/11 finally have justice.
 
 
so obama killed osama, what ever happened to muslim brotherhood
 
 
@Setanta,

I'd like to see him treated like the real person he is (was), dragged into an international court and charged with mass murder.
Instead, it's like Darth Vader on the Deathstar, the Big Baddie blown up in a hail of righteous glory, Hollywood style.
It's just all the cheering in the streets gets my Lord of the Flies nerve a-twitchin'
I know you're ultimately right, Set, you usually are, but I'm reserving my right to be wary of the American enthusiasm for self-protection coupled with the power to define "right" as it wills. Bloody glad they're on our side! (For now, anyway...)
 
 
@djjd62,

Donald Trump still wants to see the long form death certificate
 
 
@Butrflynet,

Thanks so much, Butrflynet!

I've been concerned about the "burial at sea" part, this seems to indicate that it is in fact in accordance with Muslim traditions:

 
623. * If a person dies on a ship and if there is no fear of the decay of the dead body and if there is no problem in retaining it for sometime on the ship, it should be kept on it and buried in the ground after reaching the land. Otherwise, after giving Ghusl, Hunut, Kafan and Namaz-e-Mayyit it should be lowered into the sea in a vessel of clay or with a weight tied to its feet. And as far as possible it should not be lowered at a point where it is eaten up immediately by the sea predators.

624. If it is feared that an enemy may dig up the grave and exhume the dead body and amputate its ears or nose or other limbs, it should be lowered into sea, if possible, as stated in the foregoing rule.
 

 http://www.seaservices.com/Muslim.htm 

It seems to be saying that at least a sea burial is acceptable, and at best it's actually the best way to go since there is a chance that the grave would be defiled.

I read other things (can't remember where, can find back) saying that the US wanted to avoid a shrine situation.

Wake up in the morning, eat breakfast and suddenly you are seven pages behind the lead thread. My thoughts:

- I think this is mostly symbolic since I doubt BL was directing day to day activities nor has he been for a long time. Still, it is a powerful symbol.
- I doubt there are significant AQ resources in the US waiting for the word to strike since maintaining sleeper cells for years is risky and wasteful, especially when Western countries are actively looking for them.
- I'll be interested to hear what part Pakistan played in the raid since we've had rough relations there recently. It wouldn't surprise me if this happened with some parts of the Pakistani government uninformed.
- The celebration stuff is uncalled for. If Americans find it unseemly when people in other countries celebrate our losses, why would they feel that signing in the street here would be ignored elsewhere. For those who feel justice has been served, quiet reflection would serve us better IMO.

@Butrflynet,

Thanks for that picture, Butrflynet. I had read, that "according to Islamic tradition", bin Laden had been quickly buried, at sea. Cynical me, my first thought was that I had not read anything about a picture of the dead binLaden.

I hope that they took a sample of DNA, to prove that the man who was killed was really binLaden.

I'm not from Missouri, but I believe in "show me"!
 
 
@Eorl,

There is a degree of hypocrisy in conducting a trial with a foregone conclusion which is lacking from an operation such as this. Once again, it is a war, and this was a legitimate operastion in a war. If we could have killed Hitler and gotten our troops out alive, we'd have done so, and i seriously doubt that anyone would have anguished over it.
 
 
@engineer,

Pakistan was not informed ahead of time. (Some Pakistani police were used for elements but they didn't know who the target was, and the Pakistani government was not informed.)

The more I read about the compound and the courier, the more I think he actually was pretty active (and that it wasn't just symbolic).

The compound was built for OBL in 2005, and he was tracked there by identifying and then locating his most trusted courier (no name, yet). The implication is that the courier was still active, out in the world and transporting information to and from, and that's how he was found/ tracked.
 
 
 
It's just all the cheering in the streets gets my Lord of the Flies nerve a-twitchin'
 

Mmm yes. I found that somewhat disturbing as well.
 
 
@Setanta,

Yeah, I know all that and agree mostly, (the fact of Osamas death I imagine is a "good thing" on balance) but when the option is there to take the high moral ground, shouldn't we take it? Do we really want to join the eye-for-an-eye cycle that the middle east has kept running for thousands of years?
I think the greater the power, the more responsibility it has to wield it justly and responsibly, or it risks being the greater evil.

Still, it is a powerful symbol.
 
It was a gesture toward avenging the victims of 9/11,
of whom I was 1 (vicariously), in that Laden killed a libertarian friend of mine,
of several years: NYC Police Lt. John Perry. He was also a member of Mensa.
He was in the midst of submitting his papers for retirement,
when the first plane hit. He was a lawyer n was about to begin practicing law.
He had been discussing that for about 3 years before the fateful day.
He was killed rescuing people from the dark of WTC 2,
when it collapsed on him.

Just speaking for myself: I feel avenged.

 
It wouldn't surprise me if this happened with some parts of the Pakistani government uninformed.
 
I will not hold that against obama.

@msolga,

I've had immediate fears too that things may get worse - especially with the conjunction of this event with the Gaddafi hit (or error). But my more optimistic self is winning in the meantime, though it's early yet to judge.

I was somewhat thrown by the tv program I watched last night, thrown because I'm not used to tv news in general anymore. I ended up watching msnbc online in the lead up to Obama's speech. Haven't seen Andrea Mitchell or Brian Williams in years, eh. They didn't bother me. But there were three (or more) other speakers.

Oddly, at least two of them seemed to talk with a manner of opening their mouths wide to be sure to be understood... making me think of 'talking heads'. One of the three was a woman talking about the psychological effects of this on Afghanistan and the taliban, and my reaction was that as an expert she was pretty one-sided, that she didn't seem to understand the taliban at all; didn't catch her name. One was Richard Engle, whom I haven't heard before, quite rah rah, understandable. Both of those people took a tact that this would elevate the morale of our fighting men so they can continue their fight. I am glad their mood would be elevated, but I would hope that this brings into more question re why are we staying in Afghanistan and so to accelerate bringing them home. The third guy was a pentagon rep, and I didn't have any particular twinges re what he said.

I guess my perplexity is that we have de facto made the taliban the enemy - or have we. Not that I'm for the taliban but I don't take it that they are why we have been there, exactly.

Further, are we going to hang around in both Iraq and Afghanistan basically as a presence behind the covert ops to get splinter al qaida groups? to mediate civil wars? to protect our investments? Are we in Afghanistan mainly because Pakistan has nukes?

Edits to add that I haven't read the thread's last five pages yet.
 
 
@Ticomaya,

Thank you. I'm more concerned with what's going on at Home Park at the moment. Sorry for being so parochial, but football's not a matter of life and death. It's more important than that.
 
 
@sozobe,

 
Pakistan was not informed ahead of time.
(Some Pakistani police were used for elements but they didn't know
who the target was, and the Pakistani government was not informed.)
 
His spies probably woud have tipped him off. I suspect that the CIA knew that.

I'm also wondering (with considerable concern) about what the reaction to this news will be from the more aggressive fundamentalist Muslim leaders.
 

Not worth worrying about. What IS worth worrying about is the Soros/Obunga operation taking place over Libya. THAT has the potential to get a lot of Americans killed.
 
 
@OmSigDAVID,

 
Did u say the same thing on VE Day and VJ Day ??

 

A little before my time there Dave! I think VE Day and VJ Day are completely different. Those celebrated an end to a long and grueling war, the return of loved ones, and end to killing and destruction on a massive scale; truly something to celebrate. Today, we get some closure on the WTC/Pentagon attacks with the death of BL. I think taking a moment to reflect on where the last ten years have taken us is valuable. I understand those celebrating, but I think dancing in the streets is unseemly given that tomorrow there are still AQ terrorists doing the same thing they were yesterday.

@BillRM,

Ask anyone anywhere in the world other than America whether they would like to watch premiership football or American football and you know what the answer would be. Everyone in the world calls it football. You're the only ones using the s word. It is the most beautiful game ever, that's why we have a world cup. Back in the 1980's when American football was shown on Channel 4 someone tried to explain it to me, but I couldn't be bothered. It was all stop go stop go. If you like that sort of thing fair enough, but you've probably got to be brought up to like it, like marmite with us. It bored the tits off me. Football never stops it's like a ballet. They're going to kick off in a minute and I am so Excited!

I'm not so sure about that.

 
....For many years, the Sheikh (Bin Laden) had been isolated, his organisation disrupted not only by US kill teams and lethal drone attacks but also by general Muslim apathy and outright hostility to the organisation. For most of the victims are Muslim: not only Shia Muslims and Sunni moderates and seculars, but also bystanders who have committed the deadly sin of buying vegetables while one of those holy warriors decides to fight his battle and start his ascendance to the hereafter.

The killing of Bin Laden will give a new impetus to the jihadi movement that has suffered in the past few months as the aspirations of these young men have been fulfilled, not by the jihad, but by the street demonstrations led by unarmed men and women secularists and religious calling for social justice.

Local jihadi wars will continue, al-Qaida in Yemen will continue to attempt to bomb targets in the west, and the Taliban will not stop fighting in Afghanistan.

@dadpad,

They attacked the United States because there were American troops in Saudi Arabia, which was an offense to their fundamentalist Sunni beliefs. I don't consider that a reason to justify the murder of thousands--do you?
 
 
@Setanta,

That's probably why your not an Islamic terrorism. Justification is a subjective thing, what justifies something to someone is personal. What Bin Laden did was atrocious, but he obviously thought it was justified or he wouldn't have done it.

Anyway Nothing justifies staring at Liz's apple catchers
 
 
@joefromchicago,

 
I'm confused. George W. Bush said it wasn't important whether we got Bin Laden or not. When did it become important again?

 

Apparently when the intelligence services, perhaps using enhanced techniques, got a tip from a prisioner in Guantanamo - which the hapless Obama three years ago promised to close without delay - and the lead was recognized as important in Obama's enhanced assassination program in Afghanistan & Pakistan.
 
 
One of the most detailed accounts I've seen thus far:

 http://nationaljournal.com/whitehouse/the-secret-team-that-killed-bin-laden-20110502 

Excerpt:

 
From Ghazi Air Base in Pakistan, the modified MH-60 helicopters made their way to the garrison suburb of Abbottabad, about 30 miles from the center of Islamabad. Aboard were Navy SEALs, flown across the border from Afghanistan, along with tactical signals, intelligence collectors, and navigators using highly classified hyperspectral imagers.

After bursts of fire over 40 minutes, 22 people were killed or captured. One of the dead was Osama bin Laden, done in by a double tap -- boom, boom -- to the left side of his face. His body was aboard the choppers that made the trip back. One had experienced mechanical failure and was destroyed by U.S. forces, military and White House officials tell National Journal.

Were it not for this high-value target, it might have been a routine mission for the specially trained and highly mythologized SEAL Team Six, officially called the Naval Special Warfare Development Group, but known even to the locals at their home base Dam Neck in Virginia as just DevGru.

This HVT was special, and the raids required practice, so they replicated the one-acre compound. Trial runs were held in early April.
 
 
 
@georgeob1,

If that's true which I doubt, Guantanamo has recruited far more Islamic terrorists than it's ever caught. It also means America can no longer criticise anyone else for human rights abuses.
 
 
@izzythepush,

I saw that too, though I'd have to find back where -- but the tip about the courier's name (just his real name) came from someone in Gitmo four years ago (pre-Obama).

That tip proved to be very important but it was under Obama that they found him (about two years ago), traced him, and then carried out this raid.

@sozobe,

Here we go:

 
Detainees at the prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, had given the courier’s pseudonym to American interrogators and said that the man was a protégé of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the confessed mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks.

American intelligence officials said Sunday night that they finally learned the courier’s real name four years ago, but that it took another two years for them to learn the general region where he operated.

Still, it was not until August that they tracked him to the compound in Abbottabad, a medium-sized city about an hour’s drive north of Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan.

Where's your proof of that commonplace but superficial assertion? The fact is incidences of such terrorism have been reduced significantly since we took out their sanctuary in Afghanistan; imprisioned those we caprtured there; and started killing them where we could find them. The facts aren't with you.
 
 
By the way, that photo Butrflynet posted earlier is fake. Here's one article about it:

Quote:

 
Keep this in mind: Whenever the US government releases a photo of Bin Laden, it will be crystal clear and probably come with his dental records too. Until then, I'm sure we will be seeing a lot more of these Photoshop jobs. Clearly, people need closure.
 

On the US releasing a photo, btw, CNN said this earlier:

 
‎DNA matching is under way on samples from the body of the slain terrorist leader, the official said. There are photographs of the body with a gunshot wound to the side of the head that shows an individual who is not unrecognizable as bin Laden, the official said.

No decision has yet been made on whether to release the photographs and if so, when and how.
 

The DNA match has in fact been made (multiple sources, including):

Your memory of "our Enry" was clouded by a bit of the fog of your advanced age. Ali wasnt knocked down, but was rattled pretty good. Somehow his ring guys got him some time to get unrattled and then Clay went out and slashed up Enry's face so that the refs stopped the fight. This was repated several years later and Ali did it again.
SO "Enry is always affectionately known to the Allentown Pugilistic SOciety, as "the British Bleeder"

This construction implies that the closing of Gitmo would have led these prisoners to have been let go, or somehow be beyond our control; but that's an incorrect proposition, as Obama was proposing to transfer these detainees to different facilities, not simply release all of them.

It's a lot more likely that one of the captives was successfully turned to our side, not through torture - why fuck around with pretty words?? - but through more effective, long-established techniques of psychological coercion.

And remember that Osama was a close US friend right up until 9-11. Let's also try to remember that the FBI doesn't list binLaden as responsible for 9-11.

What was that Henry Kissinger said about US allies; something like, it's more dangerous to be a US ally than a US enemy.

You are a skilled master with "pretty words", Cy.

"The US isn't a terrorist nation because we have the power to perform our terrorism in ways that aren't commonly known as terrorism and in fact separate us from the common run of the mill terrorist."

But what about all the terrorist actions performed by the CIA and its proxies, Cy?

"Umm, the US isn't a terrorist nation and I won't discuss it unless and until you agree to agree to that."
 
 
@sozobe,

 
Osama bin Laden[a] was the leader of al-Qaeda and was wanted in connection with the August 7, 1998, bombings of the United States embassies, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya. These attacks killed over 200 people. Bin Laden and al-Qaeda is alleged to be responsible for the October 12, 2000, attack on the USS Cole off the coast of Yemen, which killed 17. Although bin Laden later appeared on the first publicly released FBI Most Wanted Terrorists list on October 10, 2001, he was listed there for his alleged role in the 1998 embassy attack, and not for his alleged role in the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people, because the most wanted lists name fugitives charged with a crime by a prosecutor or under indictment by a grand jury. Bin Laden was named as an "unindicted co-conspirator" in, for instance, the federal indictment against convicted terrorist Zacarias Moussaoui, but has not been formally indicted for his alleged role in the September 11, 2001, attacks. On May 1, 2011, Osama bin Laden was confirmed killed by United States special forces by an announcement from the President of the United States, Barrack Obama in a press conference in the White House.

And remember that Osama was a close US friend right up until 9-11.

 

Nobody can remember what never happened. Try to educate yourself somewhat on Osama bin Laden's "Declaration of War" of 1996:

 
The following text is a fatwa, or declaration of war, by Osama bin Laden first published in Al Quds Al Arabi, a London-based newspaper, in August, 1996. The fatwa is entitled "Declaration of War against the Americans Occupying the Land of the Two Holy Places."
 

 http://www.pbs.org/newshour/terrorism/international/fatwa_1996.html 
 
 
@JTT,

That's not support for your assertion that he was a close friend of the US right up until 9/11.
 
 
@georgeob1,

 
Well since the original contrary proposition can't be proven either, and we are faced with the necessity of a pragmatic choice, it appears the results so far suggest we made the right and most effective choice.
 

No, the original assertion didn't depend on a causal analysis, and so we're not faced with any kind of "pragmatic choice" (nice bureaucratic doublespeak for "let me pull something out of my ass" -- your years as a government employee obviously paid off). We could simply count the number of terrorists we have captured (that shouldn't be too hard) and compare that number to the number of Guantanamo detainees who have been released and who have then gone on to become terrorists. No counterfactual analysis needed. Easy peasy.

 
I suppose liberal closet authoritarians find this line of reasonong difficult.

@Setanta,

 
Bin Laden and his organization made war on the United States, and did so before 2001. In war, taking out the enemy leadership is a reasonable tactic.
 

Really, before 2001? Let's consider just how long the US has been making war against ME countries. Let's start with the overthrow of a democratically elected leader in Iran in the early 1950s.

Oh wait, what am I talking about - you're the A2K historian, aren't you Set?

I wonder how it was that a historian of your stature missed the half century of terrorism, war crimes, etc that the US has committed against numerous ME countries.

 
The only plausible objection i can think of is that it was done in Pakistan, and i personally would consider such an objection nugatory given that Pakistan hosts terrorists,
 

Pakistan "hosts" terrorists. There's that balanced approach again, that Setanta applies to all his "historical" treatises.

A flat out lie, JW! In point of fact, I've never heard any sort of reflection from you or any other American on any of the numerous instances of terrorism and mass murder committed by the US over the last century.

Noam Chomsky points out that around 70% of Americans, [I forget when this was for] felt that Vietnam was "immoral", yet, he points out, you never hear that from anyone. The national thought expressed and left unchallenged, is that it was an honest but regrettable mistake. Mostly the "mistake" was spending so much.

You never, ever, hear any expressions of regret over the vast numbers of innocents killed. It's always, "oh, our poor troops". Those poor troops are in Iraq and Afghanistan supporting illegal invasions; an illegal invasion is a war crime.

I can think of:

1. Al Qaeda was involved with the assassination of Benazir Bhutto, the late Prime Minister of Pakistan and the wife of the current Prime Minister. You can't make trouble especially in the country you are hiding. There is a saying that criminals should not operate in areas they live in. Osama broke that rule.

2. There was probably pressure put on the Royal Family of Saudi Arabia who supports the Wahhabis who are the root cause of Islam fundamentalism. Osama was beginning to be more than an embarrassment so probably they kinda let Osama be thrown under the bus. If another 'Osama' comes along think of getting rid of the Saudi Royal Family and the Wahhabis.

3. Osama was GWB's buddy that is why the Republicans never tried to get him. Whenever GWB was low in the polls Osama issued a new threat.

I don't have that much of a story to tell. There were just lots of people (mostly young ones), lots of smiling, lots of chanting ("USA! USA!

Some alcohol---incredibly for the USA, without brown paperbags ; the cops just looked the other way, grinning---but no drunks. Occasionally I found it weird how people could be so happy about someone getting shot. But that was just me I guess. I didn't see anyone in the crowd display any ostentations meanness or glee about the shooting. People just seemed happy Bin Laden was gone.

After bursts of fire over 40 minutes, 22 people were killed or captured. One of the dead was Osama bin Laden, done in by a double tap -- boom, boom -- to the left side of his face.
 

After 40 minutes of fighting - what the hells wrong with these "special forces" - BL is executed with a double tap [don't forget the graphic, "boom,boom - that will bring in the advertisers, won't it?].

Does this say he was contained and then, instead of bringing him to trial for something that he hasn't even been indicted for, he was summarily executed?
 
 
Did anyone else notice that Osama's compound was right down the road from the military academy?? I doubt that this is a coincidence.

I am betting that the Americans will say as little as possible about what role the Pakistan Military played in keeping Osama hidden for all of these years....that a deal has be struck.

Osama Bin Laden is dead.

And I do think it is important that the U.S. killed him. His death has symbolic value, and so does the manner of his death.
 
 
@hawkeye10,

I don't think the deal was struck, but now that it's a fait accompli a deal will come out where US and Pakanstani forces go through the compound together.

I have said repeatedly that the American government has been corrupted by the corporate class, is an oppressor of the people, and that we are in the process of setting up a police state. I concentrate on the crimes the government commits against Americans, while your focus is else where.
 
 
From The New Republic:

Give President Obama credit. As he promised in a bit of florid campaign rhetoric, he followed Osama bin Laden to the cave where he lives—in this case a high-walled compound of steel and concrete not far from the capital of Pakistan.

Characteristically restrained and innately cautious, Obama was quick to note in his remarks Sunday night that the death of bin Laden “does not mark the end of our effort” against the Al Qaeda terrorism network he led. Here the president's prudence served him well. We won’t know for a long time whether this moment will mark the beginning of the end of the war on Islamist terrorism; that will depend on the current state of Al Qaeda's strength—its wealth, numbers, organizational capabilities and other information that most of us have long since ceased paying attention to with any regularity. It’s tempting to believe that decapitating the beast of Al Qaeda will weaken it forever, or render it lifeless. But we just don’t know.

Even if bin Laden’s death doesn’t operationally cripple his network, though, it’s deeply significant in its own right. We understand our history in stories, and bin Laden was always the central protagonist of the story of September 11. It may be that we personalize our history too much, that our instinct to focus on individual heroes and villains sometimes distorts our understanding and simplifies complex realities. But personalize it we do, and there could be no satisfying resolution to our story without bin Laden’s death or capture.

Indeed, it was in late 2001, when bin Laden eluded American fighters in Tora Bora, that the narrative of swift justice that we were writing for ourselves began to go awry. From there, without finishing the job, we siphoned resources away from the Afghanistan campaign and into Iraq. Over the next several years, the war on terrorism at home would notch many notable if insufficiently appreciated successes. Law-enforcement officials thwarted attacks, broke up cells, captured plotters, picked off killers. But in part because bin Laden was still at large, these stories were greeted with too much media-fed fear—this attack was stopped, but what about the next one?—and too little of the respect and sober applause they deserved.

Worse, running alongside those successes was a string of errors, failures, and even catastrophes. The biggest were those in the occupation of Iraq, in the collapse of nation-building and backsliding in Afghanistan, and in the forsaking of sacred liberties at home—including the institutionalized policies of torture, now mercifully discontinued, and of imprisoning men forever without trial, now shamefully approved and continued by a Democratic administration.

Technically, this tragic course of events would probably still have unfolded even had bin Laden been caught as soon as George W. Bush pasted his Dead-or-Alive poster on the saloon wall. Symbolically, however, bin Laden's survival accentuated the bitterness of each blunder and heightened the regret of each mistake. Even as he fell out of the headlines, he remained at the center of the story and fixed in our consciousness. His specter somehow loomed over all that seemed to go wrong in the last decade.

The ebullient hordes spontaneously gathering tonight at the White House and Ground Zero and Times Square look like the crowds that gather after a war is won. None has been. But these joyous Americans are recapturing a feeling that we lost nearly ten years ago along with bin Laden in the mountains of Tora Bora—a feeling that America was in the process, however haltingly, of prosecuting justice after a terrible blow. The twisted, tragic sequence of events that Osama bin Laden set into motion on September 11, 2001 can never be undone, but, as President Obama told the world Sunday night, there is no denying that, at long last, “justice has been done.”

Osama won....he prompted America to gorge upon debt, to indulge in our fear, and to commit acts that prove that we are morally depraved. He wanted to see America hurt, and he did, though almost all the wounds have been self inflicted. Osama was an expert in Jujutsu.

More evidence that the Military hid Osama

 
7. Who knew? The U.S. says the area around the compound has "lots of retired military." The Washington Post reports that it's "the headquarters of a brigade of the Pakistan army's 2nd Division." Despite this, the U.S. adds that "the compound was built in 2005," apparently "for the purpose of harboring" Bin Laden. How could he have arranged the construction of such a facility, and then moved into it with his family, without anyone in the local Pakistani military network knowing about it?
 
 http://www.slate.com/id/2292705/ 

Though Saletan does not think that Pakistan ever gave him up, though if I were leading the Pakistan military and I wanted to give up Osama I would demand that the US make it look like I had nothing to do with it.
 
 
@hawkeye10,

It is a private development. It doesn't mean the military especially retired ones would know of every development. In our city there are homeless people all around the Police headquarters and all kinds of petty crimes going on but there is nary a police(wo)man around to supervise or anything.
 
 
 
Argument two: Bin Laden was a symbol, not an end. After Saddam Hussein was captured, then-Democratic presidential frontrunner Howard Dean made a "gaffe." He said "the capture of Saddam Hussein has not made us safer." For this, Dean was derided as a peacenik, a fool, and a churl who couldn't stomach a victory for George W. Bush. Eight years later, who disagrees with his basic point? Months from now, when people are still taking off shoes and junking LifeWater bottles in order to get on planes, and when terrorist attacks are still taking victims in Iraq and Afghanistan, the killing of bin Laden is going to be viewed very differently. And there will be an opening again for a critique of Obama's GWOT strategy.

I am not arguing that every retired military in the area knew, only the ones who were charged with protecting and looking after Osama, who certainly were retired or active military who live in the area.

You are assuming that. Osama only gives money. He could have bribed some but to do a McCarthy accusation is wrong.

Now that's just the kind of introspection that the people of Afghanistan and Iraq appreciate from Americans, Hawk. Keep up the good work, even if it is terribly, horribly, pathetically self centered. Hey, Rome wasn't built in a day.

Repeated "boom booms" could punctuate the day and the left side of the character's face could be blown away time and again to the delight of kids and adults everywhere.

You're not raising issues that people aren't already openly talking about. The topic of what Pakistan knew, or should have known, regarding bin Laden's location, was brought up at the White House news briefing a little while ago. These are questions that will be continue to be discussed in coming days.

However, at the moment, it is in our diplomatic, and national security, interest to strengthen our ties with the Pakistan government, rather than weaken them by questioning what the Pakistani military (or government) might have known. We need the assistance of Pakistan in continuing to fight terrorism.
 
 
@firefly,

The old 'national security' meme, eh, FF? That's been used for everything including how important it was and is to rape, torture and slaughter innocent men, women and children.

When are you going to lay this old canard to rest? Surely, you've taken enough lives around the world to defend not your national security but your ability to raid the treasure of so many countries around the world.

Ask yourself, honestly now, not in the fashion that y'all normally do;

how many of the innocents that the US has butchered and continues to butcher around the world are any kind of a threat to US national security?

@realjohnboy,

Welcome, RJB. Perhaps you can answer this?

How is it that OBL is this super evil guy whose death elicits partying and dancing in the streets but US prezes who have murdered millions or hundreds of thousands or tens of thousands, get pensions and big boats or airports named after them.

Hell, a lot of these prezes were even pretty good buddies with OBL and those who the US say supported him, the Taliban. They didn't seem to care when he bombed an embassy or attacked a US something or other boat. Bush was tight with the Taliban until they sought to exclude American business.

Why is there this penchant for Americans for turning so quickly on good friends?

Mr Obama today: "The world is a safer place".

Oh no, it isn't.
 
 
Hitchens agrees with me

 
There are several pleasant little towns like Abbottabad in Pakistan, strung out along the roads that lead toward the mountains from Rawalpindi (the garrison town of Pakistani's military brass and, until 2003, a safe-house for Khalid Sheik Muhammed). Muzaffarabad, Abbottabad … cool in summer and winter, with majestic views and discreet amenities. The colonial British—like Maj. James Abbott, who gave his name to this one—called them "hill stations," designed for the rest and recreation of commissioned officers. The charming idea, like the location itself, survives among the Pakistani officer corps. If you tell me that you are staying in a rather nice walled compound in Abbottabad, I can tell you in return that you are the honored guest of a military establishment that annually consumes several billion dollars of American aid. It's the sheer blatancy of it that catches the breath.

There's perhaps some slight satisfaction to be gained from this smoking-gun proof of official Pakistani complicity with al-Qaida, but in general it only underlines the sense of anticlimax. After all, who did not know that the United States was lavishly feeding the same hands that fed Bin Laden? There's some minor triumph, also, in the confirmation that our old enemy was not a heroic guerrilla fighter but the pampered client of a corrupt and vicious oligarchy that runs a failed and rogue state.

The martyr of Abbottabad is no more, and the competing Führer-complexes of his surviving underlings will perhaps now enjoy an exciting free rein. Yet the uniformed and anonymous patrons of that sheltered Abbottabad compound are still very much with us, and Obama's speech will be entirely worthless if he expects us to go on arming and financing the very people who made this trackdown into such a needlessly long, arduous and costly one.

The exchange of views between China and Pakistan on assessing how to maintain closer coordination and cooperation is to address the uncertainties in the region in the context of the United States aiming to scale down or withdraw forces from July 2011,” Rong Ying, vice president of the China Institute of International Studies (CIIS) and an expert on China’s relations with Pakistan, told The Hindu.

“Now with the death of Osama bin Laden, this kind of coordination and consultation is even more significant,” he added.

@hawkeye10,

I will add that last year a Pakistani official said publicly that the government had fears that once Osama was gotten that the Americans would abandon them again. Given past performance and the desire of the Amercian people to cut the costs of government and to stop playing global police man this is a very high percentage bet. The fact that it now looks like the Pakistani's hid Osama for years so that they could continue to collect their $1 billion a year makes this pretty much a lock.

Do you know if - legally - "burial at sea" involves wrapping up the body in a sheet and dropping overboard, or is there an anchor / chain wrapped around as well?
 

I don't think that's so much a legal matter as it is a religious or practical matter. Fortunately, I've never had to dispose of a body at sea -- at least not intentionally.

 

Thank you. Under Islamic rules only people who die at sea can be buried at sea - not the case in Abbotsville (sorry can't remember local version of name).

Wonder why Saudi Arabia refused to take in his body for burial. Their "empty quarter" is an endless sea of sand - that's where they dispose of their hapless dissidents. No swords, no beheadings - just drive them out couple of hundred miles into the desert, push them off the truck, drive back. Doesn't take long after daybreak to get to 120 Fahrenheit in the shade - and there is no shade. Nobody even finds their bones. Unmarked graves are OK in Islam.

This is an interesting point -- I knew the components but hadn't put 'em together:

 
Obviously one can argue that any president with this type of intel could have and would have done the same as President Obama. Fair enough. Yet, what strikes me the most is this: The C.I.A. tracked down the courier last August to the compound in Abbottabad. By September "the C.I.A. had decided that there was a “strong possibility” that Bin Laden himself was hiding there."

If you recall, this was all happening while Obama and the Democrats were getting crushed in the polls. Any President could have taken the information, simply bombed the hell out of the compound, claimed they killed for Bin Laden for a nice "October surprise" to score political points. Obama not only decided not to do this, but not even a whisper of it leaked out. That to me is something this president could have done and did not do. I'm not sure every president would have done the same.

Little-Known Facts About Afghanistan and Bin Laden

 http://georgewashington2.blogspot.com/2009/12/did-us-fail-to-provide-evidence-of-bin.html 

The government apparently planned the Afghanistan war before 9/11 (see this and this).
And the government apparently could have killed Bin Laden in 2001 and AGAIN in 2007, but failed to do so.

In fact, starting right after 9/11 -- at the latest -- the goal has always been to create "regime change" and instability in Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya, Sudan, Somalia, Lebanon and other countries. As American historian, investigative journalist and policy analyst Gareth Porter writes in the Asia Times:
Three weeks after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, former US defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld established an official military objective of not only removing the Saddam Hussein regime by force but overturning the regime in Iran, as well as in Syria and four other countries in the Middle East, according to a document quoted extensively in then-under secretary of defense for policy Douglas Feith's recently published account of the Iraq war decisions. Feith's account further indicates that this aggressive aim of remaking the map of the Middle East by military force and the threat of force was supported explicitly by the country's top military leaders.
Feith's book, War and Decision, released last month, provides excerpts of the paper Rumsfeld sent to President George W Bush on September 30, 2001, calling for the administration to focus not on taking down Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda network but on the aim of establishing "new regimes" in a series of states...

***
General Wesley Clark, who commanded the North Atlantic Treaty Organization bombing campaign in the Kosovo war, recalls in his 2003 book Winning Modern Wars being told by a friend in the Pentagon in November 2001 that the list of states that Rumsfeld and deputy secretary of defense Paul Wolfowitz wanted to take down included Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya, Sudan and Somalia [and Lebanon].

***
When this writer asked Feith... which of the six regimes on the Clark list were included in the Rumsfeld paper, he replied, "All of them."

***

The Defense Department guidance document made it clear that US military aims in regard to those states would go well beyond any ties to terrorism. The document said the Defense Department would also seek to isolate and weaken those states and to "disrupt, damage or destroy" their military capacities - not necessarily limited to weapons of mass destruction (WMD).
Indeed, the goal seems to have more to do with being a superpower (i.e. an empire) than stopping terrorism.

As Porter writes:

After the bombing of two US embassies in East Africa [in 1988] by al-Qaeda operatives, State Department counter-terrorism official Michael Sheehan proposed supporting the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance in Afghanistan against bin Laden's sponsor, the Taliban regime. However, senior US military leaders "refused to consider it", according to a 2004 account by Richard H Shultz, Junior, a military specialist at Tufts University.

A senior officer on the Joint Staff told State Department counter-terrorism director Sheehan he had heard terrorist strikes characterized more than once by colleagues as a "small price to pay for being a superpower".

And recall that former U.S. National Security Adviser (and top foreign policy advisor) Zbigniew Brzezinski told the Senate that the war on terror is "a mythical historical narrative".

Cynics argue that America is just the latest in a long string of empires trying to control the "crossroads" between East and West.

And people such as the former UK ambassador to Afghanistan argue that there are even uglier reasons for America's involvement in Afghanistan.

This essay does not address such questions. All I'm asking is whether the U.S. refusal to accept the Taliban's offer to hand over Bin Laden should be viewed as similar to its refusal to accept Saddam's offer to go into exile for $1 billion dollars. In other words, we should ask whether the U.S. was hell-bent on going to war against Afghanistan and Saddam, without - contrary to official statements - really caring about the bad guys.

"The ultimate weakness of violence is that it is a descending spiral, begetting the very thing it seeks to destroy. Instead of diminishing evil, it multiplies it. Through violence you may murder the liar, but you cannot murder the lie, nor establish the truth. Through violence you may murder the hater, but you do not murder hate. In fact, violence merely increases hate. So it goes. Returning hate for hate multiplies hate, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that.”

Upon getting back to DC today and getting first hand accounts of Penn Ave last night, I withdraw my previous statement about wishing I was back in town. Apparently the crowd at first were some people just meeting up and waving and whistling. People talking about where they were when... etc. It later spoiled in to nothing more than an obnoxious frat party of emotionalism. Namely hate-emotionalism. Jingoistic fervor.

We are celebrating but we should not. I don't blame people for celebrating though. It's become our only custom upon significant events. It is now instinctual. We lack a custom for moments like this. We may feel much, and our feelings may grant us much familiarity, but we can bond without clenched fists and blood-stained ivories.

I'm glad Osama's body has been handled with proper cultural rites. He lived life poorly, so let him die well and die with finality. The only way we ever killed the boogie man was to grow up and stop looking under the bed.

We should not want Hell for a man like this, but oblivion.

"USA USA USA" simply misses the mark. Americans looking to bond, need a greater perspective on how this effect the world. But there are no cheers for the earth or for mankind as a whole.

@Ionus,

I think the response to the news reveals how much healing has yet to happen. There is a psychological wound here, and it's one that will take time to heal. I think many of my peers bear psychological scars. It has been them, those young few, thirsty in the dessert, being ripped limb from limb. They've come back broken, poor, and bitter. I think you don't know my generation, my peers. We're tired of old men fighting over dust and oil.

I think about Carl Sagan a lot these days, and perhaps I've been over-quoting his pale blue dot. A few words of his stand out.

 
From this distant vantage point, the Earth might not seem of particular interest. But for us, it's different. Look again at that dot. That's here, that's home, that's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there – on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.

Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.

The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.

It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.
 

We are a long ways from mending such a wound, and I for one find solace and my own medicine thinking about the passage above.

@Ionus,

 
Do you feel not celebrating Rubbish bin Laden's death
will make yours more distant or make you more righteous amongst your peers ?
 
Have u heard WHAT Laden was shot with ??
HOW did thay kill him ?
 
 
@failures art,

I am happy you can find solace. But I doubt your motives in saying we shouldnt celebrate the death of the personification of terror. Whilst you are not heavily critical of such people who were celebrating, I think they are entitled to be joyous. Who can say they are wrong ? They have their lives to lead.

 
I think you don't know my generation, my peers.

Wow. Dr Martin Luther King said it so much more eloquently than I. Who'd a thunk?
 
 
It might have been fun
to shoot Laden with a FLAME thrower,
(I bet THAT 'd get his attention)
but it is not e z to use those in ranger operations;
awkward to move them around.

Special forces have a wide range of weapons to choose from.....given there were no hostages which could demand the use of low power small calibre weapons, than I think any high powered weapon could have been used.....personally I would have taken my trusty SLR with me, despite its length....greater hitting power and it will penetrate most vests.

Given the length of the firefight, I dont think it was reasonable to take him prisoner unless he played dead. If he was vertical he should have been shot dead rather than risk one more life in the event he was strapped with explosives.

He has been dead for years anyway. The problem was when to officially kill him. He was already past the average life expectancy for a man in that area. He had bad health but exactly what is not known, though heart and kidney disease are possible.
 
 
@Ionus,

To those who felt the effect of his actions directly, I still feel compassion for. Certainly, I can imagine such news to cathartic, but sadly I feel that justice is illusory and the feeling will be fast and fleeting. Those people will never stop hurting fully, and such a thing is truly awful.

Words like "justice" are for us, so we may make such an event digestible and so it fits into a sort of narrative. I cannot project to the victims and survivors that they must feel better; justified; or healed.

I'll let them feel whatever they wish. They are entitled to feel how they feel, and they have no national obligation to feel better on my behalf to fulfill said narrative. I do hope that in some small way this provide them some sort of solace. It is a horrible burden.

@failures art,

Thanks for the essay, Art.
I remember 911, of course, which was the beginning of this chapter. Little Tony raced into my store and we, employees and customers, gathered as the news got worse and worse.
A customer, who was a child in WW2 Norway, quietly said "The world will never be the same." And I think we all agreed with that.
I don't know what the "proper" response should have been. Probably not what you missed in front of the White House hours later in what you refer to as a frat party.
In my mind it was, of all places, in a baseball stadium in Philadelphia in the bottom of the 9th in a game with the NY Mets. There is video. This was not any kind of orchestrated "spontaneous" response. Rather it was thousands upon thousands of people who had gathered for a baseball game seeing the news flash across a scoreboard.
In my mind, although there probably was some "USA! USA!" rhetoric, it was more of "Osama is dead. A chapter is over."

Quoting myself on page 8,
"I'm glad their (the troops) mood would be elevated, but I would hope that this brings into more question re why are we staying in Afghanistan and so to accelerate bringing them home. [...]

I guess my perplexity is that we have de facto made the taliban the enemy - or have we. Not that I'm for the taliban but I don't take it that they are why we have been there, exactly.

Further, are we going to hang around in both Iraq and Afghanistan basically as a presence behind the covert ops to get splinter al qaida groups? to mediate civil wars? to protect our investments? Are we in Afghanistan mainly because Pakistan has nukes?"

No as there are a hell of a lot of experts in that field that do not work for the CIA or more to the point NSA and as far as anyone can tell outside of government service no one can break modern encryption routines such as 256 AES or Serpent or Twofish and you can chain them together if you care to.

The government as in NSA have a lot of hardware’s and a lot of experts but they are not magicians and the laws of mathematic apply to them also.

They've been hiding him this whole time, it seems.
 
 
@Lash,

The WH claims that Pakistan was not notified, but area residents say that it was strange that the blast was not followed by emergency response. All signs are that agents from the INI were working with the CIA, that Osama had been guests of the INI but they turned on him, and that these agents killed the local response.

In Arabic writing, there are no consonants to romanize, so there never will be a standard spelling of consonants. (It fluctuates in the German press quite frequently.)

Yes they would be eager to bring that kind of hell down on them that would result in any attack on the US when we are going after Laden!!!

And somehow I had a feeling that those helicopters was being protected with enough air cover to deal with anything that the Pakistans could get into the air.

I agree. Way too similar.
 
 
@BillRM,

 
And somehow I had a feeling that those helicopters was being protected with enough air cover to deal with anything that the Pakistans could get into the air.
 
Reports are the the mission was delayed two days, which just so happened to be cloudy, and the night of the mission was clear...I'd say you are correct.
 
 
I don't feel like reading back to see exactly which posts it was, but somewhere in this thread I read an excerpt someone posted that said there were a total of 22 people in the compound that were either killed or captured.

Earlier, like on the first or second page of this thread, there was an excerpt that detailed a number of people from the compound (wives, relatives, etc.) that had been detained/arrested.

Questions:

If there was no other involvement than the handful of Seals, who detained/arrested the wives?

If not all the 22 people were killed, but some were captured, where were the captured taken? Did they leave in the helicopters with the Seals?

Where are they now, on board ship? What is their destination?
 
 
@hawkeye10,

I wouldnt have notified the indigenous assets either. They cannot be trusted no matter what. Theyve demonstrated this at least 2 times before.
WH didnt want to put our guys in danger and have a fiasco to deal with like the 1979 "guests of the Ayatollah". Too politically charged with every conservative nipping at his heels like a bunch of yippy dogs

The choppers came in and left with escorts. I dont think the PAkistan AIr Force would challenge, itd look bad to get badly scratched. That would send a message of incompetence to the conditions in PAkistan that are already a teeter totter.

US official: Bin Laden skull blown apartShareThisPrint E-mail.By EILEEN SULLIVAN

The Associated Press

WASHINGTON — A U.S. official says Osama bin Laden was shot above his left eye, blowing away part of his skull.

Robert and Karen Henrichs of New Hyde Park, N.Y, visit Ground Zero to show solidarity with September 11th victims on what he calls a happy day, Monday, May 2, 2011, in New York. (AP Photo/John Minchillo)

.The precision kill shot was delivered by a member of Navy's elite SEAL Team Six during a pre-dawn raid Monday on bin Laden's hideout in Pakistan.

Photos of bin Laden's injuries were transmitted to Washington as proof that the mission was a success. The administration wasn't releasing the photos Monday.

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to reporters.

It looks to me like the USA is trying to protect the Pakistani military, but it is increasingly clear that Pakistan was playing a double game, which was costing Us $1 billion a year and was keeping Osama and his family safe.....that aint going to go over too well with Americans. Obama best be careful with his lies, I understand not wanting Osama's people to figure out that the INI turned Osama over to the USA, but I think they are bright enough to have already figured that out. Lying to the American people will not help Pakistan any.

Their nukes don't come anywhere close to what the US has and lest you forget, the US is the only country to have used nukes, twice, both times when there was no actual need. It was just political boasting.

And let's not forget all the chemical and biological weapons the US has. You remember, the ones that they supplied to Saddam so he could use them on the Iranians and the Kurds in Iraq.

The Osama we knew
Pratap Bhanu Mehta
Tue May 03 2011, 00:53 hrs

In death, as in life, Osama bin Laden will be over-interpreted. His crimes are easily described. He masterminded an extraordinary network that was responsible for some audaciously murderous acts of terror. There is no adequate moral framework in which to comprehend his death. There will perhaps be some closure for the families who suffered immeasurably by what he unleashed. But whether the terms of justice or revenge measure up to the sheer convulsions he unleashed is an open question.
Osama became a force, far in excess of the violence he unleashed, fundamentally transforming our world. Ideologically, he created an extraordinary churning in the Muslim world: a potent combination of inner-directed resentment, violent fervour and anti-imperialism. He fought his own reactionary milieu with an unprecedented fanaticism. He challenged the established order and produced a crisis of authority inside Islam. When the entire world was putting its weight and force of arms behind reactionary regimes like Saudi Arabia, he created his own geopolitical convulsions. In an age that prized the nation state, he spawned a violent global movement. He became everything: an agent, an idea, an ideology, a pretext. These ideological effects, as far-reaching as they were, will not endure. The Americans may have killed bin Laden. But the ideology he unleashed will die if the democratic revolutions in the Arab world succeed in full measure. His greatest ideological nightmare, modernity, has an uncanny way of reasserting itself.

But his enduring effect is more subtle. He redefined the way in which we think of power in the modern world. A small group using violence and artfully manipulating the media could create disproportionate effects on a scale unimaginable. He was never going to defeat the power of liberalism ideologically. But he managed to transform liberal practice for the worst. Freedom in liberal states now comes against a backdrop of surveillance, militarisation, suspicion and human rights compromises. This legacy will take a long time to undo, if ever.

What will be the consequences of his death? The immediate consequence is a much-needed boost for President Obama. It will come as a much-needed palliative for American pride that was being relentlessly dented in all quarters. And the first rule of international politics is that psychological effects are more far-reaching than any assessment of interests. The politics behind Osama has always been even more shadowy than his movements were. There is still no reckoning of the forces that supported him and used him. Just the circumstances of his death, barely 800 yards from the Pakistan Military Academy, should leave no one in any doubt that he was, all these years, being politically used and protected by the ISI in Pakistan. The US has, for more than a decade, been either unbelievably gullible or ominously cynical in relation to Pakistan. In a curious way, Osama’s death only deepens the mystery of US and Pakistani conduct; it does not resolve it.

But future events turn on two questions. If the ISI was using him in life, what are their calculations about his death? Did he die because his protectors now found his death convenient? Or did he die despite his protectors? The US will have to play this narrative very delicately. The one thing you know about the ISI establishment is that it is very good at playing heads we win, tails you lose. If this operation is seen in any way as a humiliation for the ISI, it will get its back. Nothing is more dangerous than the core Pakistani establishment licking its wounds. And the one thing Osama has taught us is this: there is no force more lethal than the sense of being wounded. If the ISI was in on it, it will extract its pound of flesh.

How his death is represented is going to be crucial in determining future politics. Some argue that his death exposed Pakistan’s complicity; others that it demonstrates their cooperation with the West. But whether Pakistan was duplicitous or cooperative will probably not matter much. It will remain indispensable for the US for two reasons. First, if this allows the US to claim victory and hasten a withdrawal from Afghanistan, Pakistan will remain important even in a post-withdrawal scenario. Second, Osama’s death will not do away with the most important pretext for heavy US adjustment towards Pakistan: the blackmail that nuclear weapons may fall into the wrong hands. Unless the US calls Pakistan’s bluff on this proposition, its hands remain tied.

The second question is this: what impact will Osama’s death have on radical militant groups and movements, both inside and outside Pakistan? The short answer is: probably very little. Many of the terrorist groups have been sustained by the support of some state or the other. Those geo-political considerations that lead the states to support some groups are not likely to diminish. Or rather they will diminish only for other larger considerations. In the case of Pakistan the core question still remains: Osama or no Osama, does the support of terror groups still constitute a core of the Pakistani state’s strategic orientation towards both Afghanistan and India? Second, radical politics, such as it exists, is shaped by larger social and political forces. To what extent does al-Qaeda remain an important inspiration? All accounts seem to suggest, not very much. But Osama’s death is probably going to allow for a little bit of ideological clearing. Instead of an ideological construction of a single war on terror, we will now place different groups more firmly in their geopolitical and social settings. It will be harder to personify all terrorism behind a single face.

The regime in Pakistan still has to handle two delicate political issues. The point about large terror networks, like civil wars, is this. Once structures of violence have been put in place they don’t simply disappear. Some will doubtless try acts of revenge to polarise politics further. But the second question is the degree of political blow-back inside Pakistan. I think it is fair to say that there is probably not much popular support for Osama at this point; the chances of a popular backlash are remote. But if the sense grows that Pakistan is being humiliated in the aftermath of this attack, then the psychological dynamics of politics could change. This is where the politics of representation will be important.

Osama may be gone. His tactics made him impossible to deal with in political terms. Whether his death will leave us politically wiser is an open question.

but surprisingly friendly to the USA.

 
What the hell? Is anything short of yelling DEATH TO THE USA! being friendly? Basically he is saying that we have either been chumps or morally bankrupt, and that we dont have a lot of power to throw around, both true, but not friendly in the admiring sense.
 
 
As far as Pakistan is concerned the real enemy is India. The ISI has a close relationship with Al Qaida going back to the Russian Invasion. Pakistan is caught between the need to combat terrorism, and in fairness Pakistan has been bombed one hell of a lot, and the desire not to be seen by the population as Kow-Towing to America.

It's obvious someone knew about Bin Laden's whereabouts, but kept stum. Maybe they were wanting to keep Bin Laden on ice to use as a strategic asset elsewhere. Maybe they were scared of the repercussions if they handed him over. It could be this or many other reasons. It could just be confined to ISI.

The ISI is quite murky with it's own factions. Once you enter the world of spooks you really don't know what each individuals loyalty/agenda is, and that's true the world over whether we're talking about spooks in the ISI, MI6 or CIA. What's interesting now is aid to Pakistan. Do they deserve it? Is it just pouring good money after bad? Or is it the only thing keeping the fundamentalists away?
 
 
@Ionus,

The open displays of joy by so many Americans, while I understand them, I have a hard time accepting them.

Yes, I am glad he is dead.
However, after the 9/11 attacks, there was video of people in the middle east openly cheering the attacks.
They were condemned and criticized by most Americans, and rightfully so.
Now, we are doing the same thing.
People are cheering, dancing in the streets, and doing the exact same thing we criticized others for.

While I understand the need to applaud his death, I had hoped that the citizens of this country were above open cheering.
The videos I saw could have come from the post 9/11 celebrations in parts of the middle east, they lookied almost identical.
 
 
@mysteryman,

I think there is a huge difference between cheering the death of one man, a figure head who is guilty of multiple murders and cheering the deaths of many innocents. I can accept people responding to it like they did, but I have trouble accepting the Arab world and their gloating over murder.

She's obviously not got over the death of her son. At the end of the day we only know what's in our own experience. You've got to take some things on trust. Sadam's son's weren't paraded around they were photographed, and those photographs could have been faked. I think the explanation for Bin Laden's speedy burial is innocent enough.

A lot of conspiracy theorists believe they're the only ones who know the truth, but most of the time it's a reaction to not being able to live in the real world I think she may fit into that category, although to be fair I don't know a lot about her.

The "alternative" has been my read on this. I wonder if there is something in wikileak world that might clarify it.

 

The WikiLeaks clarification might involve Facebook's evil collaboration with the U.S. government.

 
WikiLeaks Founder: "Facebook is the most appalling spy machine that has ever been invented"
(Matt Brian, TheNextWeb.com, May 2, 2011)

Despite awaiting extradition to Sweden on sexual assault charges, Wikileaks founder Julian Assange is still the subject of much media interest.

Russia Today (RT) interviewed Assange, getting his viewpoint on political unrest in Egypt and Libya, particularly probing what the Wikileaks founder makes of social media’s roles in the recent revolutions in both countries. In his interview, Assange focuses particularly on Facebook calling it the “most appalling spy machine that has ever been invented”.

Explaining in more detail, Assange affirms: "Here we have the world’s most comprehensive database about people, their relationships, their names, their addresses, their locations, their communications with each other, and their relatives, all sitting within the United States, all accessible to US Intelligence.”

According to Assange, it doesn’t stop with Facebook. He believes the social network is joined by Google, Yahoo and other major US organisations that have “built in interfaces for US Intelligence”: "It’s not a matter of serving a subpoena, they have an interface they have developed for US Intelligence to use. Now, is the case that Facebook is run by US Intelligence? No, it’s not like that. It’s simply that US Intelligence is able to bring to bear legal and political pressure to them. It’s costly for them to hand out individual records, one by one, so they have automated the process."

The Wikileaks founder then warns Facebook users, stating that if a user adds their friend to Facebook, they are “doing free work for US Intelligence agencies, in building this electronic database for them”.
 
 
 
@Ionus,

 
I think there is a huge difference between cheering the death of one man, a figure head who is guilty of multiple murders and cheering the deaths of many innocents. I can accept people responding to it like they did, but I have trouble accepting the Arab world and their gloating over murder.

 

It all depends on your point of view. Those cheering American deaths likely did so because they believed Americans are responsible for killing others and it was justice being delievered to those who seemed to be beyond justice. I don't agree with that point of view but it is what it is. For those who hold that point of view, seeing Americans cheering in the street would have the same impact on them that their cheering did after 911 did on us. Osama's death is the closing chapter of a long and convoluted murder story. I can close the book with satisfaction but I don't see any reason to cheer. The dead did not return to life.

Nonsense and no matter if we cheer or cry real tears over his death it is not going to affect people who held such a mass murder of innocent men women and children in high regards.

So here is a cheer from me.........
 
 
Leave the cheering to the crabs and wotnot on the sea floor that are nibbling away on the corpse about now. As for us, we should probably keep our eyes open towards the next few weeks, months and years...just my opinion....not worth much, but there it is....
 
 
@Ticomaya,

You're not really comparing like with like though. You live in a democracy with human rights and a free press. The people who were cheering after 9/11 don't. Most of the time they live in oppressive regimes, or under a brutal occupation, and blame a lot of it on America.

One of the successes of Bin Laden was that he was able to position himself and islamic fundamentalism as the only alternative to despostic regimes that for the most part are backed by America. Did you know that Iran was once a model democracy, until it was overthrown by the Shah in an American lead coup? You may not remember that but the Iranians do.

I'm only speculating here, but I imagine that those who were cheering were not celebrating the deaths of thousands of innocents, but that someone had struck back against the country that many believed had been oppressing them for years. I know that doesn't make it right, but it's easier to understand.

Arabs have long memories. They're still going on about the bloody crusades.

Still, one of the most promising things about Bin Laden's death was the muted reaction throughout the moslem world. If it had happened when Bush was president I'm sure there would have been demonstations world wide. Although I think it's more to do with the Arab spring than anything else. Anyway it looks like Al Qaida have got more to do with the past than the future and that can only be a good thing.

Killing him or not killing him Cheering his death or not cheering his death is not going to affect our risks in any way or in any manner in my mind.

The people who had been willing to follow his wishes to kill our people is still going to do their best to kill us one way or another in any regards.
 
 
@Ticomaya,

Correct me if I'm wrong but I don't recall that there was much cheering when Reagan died. If ever there was an empty headed figure head, it was Reagan. [maybe I'm being a little hasty - there was Bush JR].

I don't think the cheering, "USA #1!" on the White House lawn is going to do much to discourage the extremists. If anything, it'll be seen as a challenge to be met.

Just my opinion.

Could be wrong.

So if no one did such cheering on the white house lawn then there would be one less person willing to put a suicide vest or underwear on is that your opinion?

But for the cheering there would be less plots to kill us being generated in the future is that your opinion?
 
 
@Lash,

 
I definitely see the US motive for discovering the status quo in Pakistan and being inactive for a while - but are you suggesting we were in on hiding him in the first place? What would our motive be?
 

You seemingly are that thick, Lash. OBL, like a lot of other less than desirable individuals have been close friends and allies of the US. Take a look at the historical record, nooooo, not the propaganda that you're used to, the facts. OBL was made, supported by the US, as was the Taliban.

The US could have had OBL years ago. The Taliban offered him a number of times, but the US always refused. Bush refused, choosing instead to create a situation that caused the deaths of untold numbers of Afghans. And don't give me that bullshit about how Bush was trying to save them from the Taliban. The US didn't give a shit about the people of Afghanistan. They made and supported the Taliban for many years.

The US provided massive funding to fight the Soviets, and politicians in the US stated they had no problem with a million or so Afghans dying just as long as the US could hand the Soviets their own Vietnam.

French troops could have killed OBL twice but both times they were stopped by American forces.

Take a good close look at the deaths caused by the terrorist actions of OBL and Al Qaeda and compare them to those caused by the US. OBL and the boys are pikers, their numbers don't come anywhere close to the murderous actions of the US for over a century of terrorism.

 
America’s Terrorist Training Camp
October 30, 2001

What’s the difference between Al Qaeda and Fort Benning?

By George Monbiot. Published in the Guardian 30th October 2001

“If any government sponsors the outlaws and killers of innocents,” George Bush announced on the day he began bombing Afghanistan, “they have become outlaws and murderers themselves. And they will take that lonely path at their own peril.” I’m glad he said “any government”, as there’s one which, though it has yet to be identified as a sponsor of terrorism, requires his urgent attention.

For the past 55 years it has been running a terrorist training camp, whose victims massively outnumber the people killed by the attack on New York, the embassy bombings and the other atrocities laid, rightly or wrongly, at Al-Qaeda’s door. The camp is called the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation, or WHISC. It is based in Fort Benning, Georgia, and it is funded by Mr Bush’s government

 http://www.monbiot.com/2001/10/30/americas-terrorist-training-camp/ 

 

“If any government sponsors the outlaws and killers of innocents,” George Bush announced on the day he began bombing Afghanistan, “they have become outlaws and murderers themselves."

Why is it that when a US prez tells baldfaced lies like this, the entire US nation isn't rolling on the floor laughing their asses off?

Vietnam [millions of innocents killed], Nicaragua [40-50 thousand], Guatemala [tens of thousands], the Philippines [hundreds of thousands], Korea [millions], Japan [hundreds of thousands], Laos & Cambodia [million plus],....
 
 
@BillRM,

Erm...I think flag-waving and chanting, "We're better than you!" inspires a lot of resentment in people from other countries and cultures, yes. And I suspect that that sort of thing would probably eventually result in a few more terrorist attacks, yes.

That said, I'd never condone restricting anyone's freedom of speech, short of yelling "Fire!" in a crowded theatre sort of thing, of course.

So, while I thing it's counter-productive, I would never support gov't action to suppress it.
 
 
@engineer,

How can you say that, Engineer? The historical record is so clear. What part of the US overthrew a democratically elected government in Iran and installed a brutal dictator don't you understand. The US then had the CIA train the Shah's SAVAK in highly efficient methods of torture.

This scenario has been repeated so many times across the globe by the US that it astounding that you could even suggest such a thing. Look at the hugely disproportionate response of the US to 9-11 and then ask yourself,

Are Americans the only people who could feel such anger; what about when the numbers killed by American terrorism are 4 million; 50,ooo; 3 million; 1 million; 30,000; 100,000; 750,000?
 
 
We're not really a nation of flag wavers. But Southampton was full of flags yesterday. Not because of Bin Laden though, but because the football team got promoted. It was the front page of our local paper Southern Daily Echo. Bin Laden's capture was a little picture at the top next to the title, other news.

To be honest I think we were the most jubilant. I know I was. I've been on a total high ever since.
 
 
As Winston Churchill said, "Two great nations, divided by a common language"--what does it mean when a football team (yes, I do know that's what we call soccer) gets PROMOTED?
 
 
@FBM,

 
I would never support gov't action to suppress it.
 

But the vast majority of Americans have spent a lifetime encouraging this pathetic display of childish behavior.
 
 
FRONTLINE

Fighting for bin Laden
On air and online
May 3, 2011 at 9:00pm

In the aftermath of the killing of Osama bin Laden, FRONTLINE presents two inside views of the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban. First, Afghan journalist Najibullah Quraishi -- who reported last year's award-winning FRONTLINE film Behind Taliban Lines -- once again journeys deep inside enemy territory. This time, he gains extraordinary access to a band of militants and foreign fighters in Afghanistan who say they're loyal to bin Laden and are readying a Spring offensive against the U.S.

Then, FRONTLINE crosses the border into Pakistan, where correspondents Stephen Grey and Martin Smith go inside The Secret War against the militants. They uncover new details of a CIA "private army" of militiamen launching kill raids against al Qaeda and the Taliban inside Pakistan. They also find new evidence of covert support for elements of the Taliban by the Pakistani military and its intelligence service, the ISI. At a safe-house not far from where bin Laden was killed, they make contact with one mid-level Taliban commander who tells FRONTLINE, "If they really wanted to, [the Pakistanis] could arrest us all in an hour."

@JTT,

 
"If they really wanted to, [the Pakistanis] could arrest us all in an hour."
 
The timing could not be worse for the hawks....it will be very difficult for Obama to get Congressional support for staying in the region even if he wanted to, which is not clear that he does. China is right to assume that Afghanistan and Pakistan will be their problem soon. I am not buying that our relationship with Pakistan is too long running and complex to end, I see enormous pressures on both sides to end it.
 
 
@MontereyJack,

I'm not gouing to use the s word, it sounds too public schoolboy, like rugger. And they're the sort of people who don't play football anyway. Sorry I've probably made things even more obscure. First of all soccer is short for association football, as oppossed to rugby football, or american football. What you would call a public school we would call a state school. In the UK a public school is one of the few top private schools normally set up by some king in 13 something or other to educate the children of the local gentry. Eton is one, and both princes went there and our prime minister.

Anyway sorry to answer your question, in England there are four professional football leaques. The top one is the premiership, which is probably the most popular sporting league in the world. Then it's the championship, then league 1 and league 2. I know that sounds confusing, it used to be divisions 1,2,3 and 4 which is alot simpler.

Every season each football team plays every other football team in the same league twice. Home and Away. Win 3 points Draw 1 point lose ) points. At the end of every season all the points are added up. In the premiership the top four teams get to play for the European cup against other top European clubs. The three teams with the least points get demoted to the championship.

The top two teams in the championship get automatically promoted to the premiership the next four sides go into the play offs, against each other with the winner getting the third premiership place. And so on down the leagues with sides going up and down each season.

Southampton are currently in League 1. There is one final game left on Saturday so that's an extra 3 points. Southampton are on 2nd place with 89 points. The only side that can catch us are Huddersfield on 86. They could win on Saturday and we could lose. That would put us level on points. When that happens goal difference is looked at. All the goals you scored in the season minus all the ones you let in giving a + or - figure depending on how well you did. Our goal difference is + 46 Huddersfield's in +29. Meaning they would have to win 9-0 and we would have to lose 9-0. That's not going to happen. 4-0 is a really high score in football. So to all intents and purposes we're promoted to the championship, and hopefully next season we'll be promoted to the premiership which is the one that matters
 
 
@hawkeye10,

The clear point that you seemed to have missed [who ever said that Americans are ignorant of the world at large and blind to their problems?] is that there is no reason at all for Pakistan, or really, any country to trust the US.

The US is perfidy personified.

Sorry for going on about football. Pakistan has the bomb, and for all its problems we get on better with them than North Korea. One rogue state with the bomb is enough, so Pakistan has got us all over a barrel.

Pakistan has already sold nuclear technology to Gadaffi, supported muslim radicals against the US, and been responsible for terrorist attack on India....at some point we need to change the game, because we (civilization) seem to be losing this one. Letting China run the region likely will be the best chance for success.
 
 
Sometimes coming late to a thread can provide an interesting perspective.

One thing I've definitely noticed with this story in the news, is that reported details differ widely and daily. I suppose the media is so desperate to have something new to report, they will report anything and everything they come across. Interestingly enough, A2K members (at least on this thread) tend to follow suit, reporting, commenting upon, and sometimes even arguing about each new item of news that trickles out. If you've been frequently posting to the thread you may not even notice it.

This isn't a criticism. This forum is not what I would consider a reliable source for news and members are not subject to journalistic ethics. I do mean to criticize the legitimate news media though.

It will be some time yet before we have a clear and factual account of what happened, and even then I doubt we will ever know all the details. Certainly, there will always be enough sense that the full story has not been told so that kooky conspiracy theorists can have a nice long act of mental masturbation.

What is clear to me is that Bin Laden is dead, that our military and intelligence forces did an amazing job, and that Obama is to be congratulated.

I'm sure that even when they release the photos of his ruined body (which they should do ASAP ) there will be many who deny he was killed. Ultimately, it won't matter, as long as most of the world believes he was.

I have to say I found the news very unsatisfying. I always thought I would feel at least relieved when I learned he was dead and, frankly, exhilarated by news that our soldiers actually shot and killed him, but it was not the case.

I'm glad he's dead. He deserved to suffer a violent, fear filled death, and although it doesn't appear that he has been a practical force in the jihadi movement for some time now, he certainly was a symbolic one. In any case, it's a good thing that any value a living Bin Laden provided our enemies has been extinguished.

Maybe it's the fact that it's been ten years since his most infamous deed was perpetrated and the visceral desire for revenge has faded over the years. Maybe it's because his death will not end the war with Islamists, and there are still millions of our fellow human beings who refuse to acknowledge his evil and consider him a hero.

I would not say I have been offended by the celebrations in the US, but I feel no empathy with the participants. In fact it seems silly to me. Again, I'm glad he's dead and I'm very glad that our forces killed him, but I just don't see the reason to celebrate.

President Obama deserves congratulations, because it would have been very easy for him to muck the whole thing up based on political considerations, and he didn't. There may have been a political consideration and bet made on giving the GO order on the raid, but it's churlish to suggest that such a possibility diminishes the fact that he did the right thing and it succeeded wonderfully. Besides, this is something he promised during the campaign and he delivered: We found out where Osama was and we went it and got him. I guess it was a big risk for the country as well as him personally, but I approve of him taking it.

What is also clear to me is that it is ridiculous to worry that violating Muslim sensibilities by dancing in the streets or burying him at sea will result in new terrorists and new attacks. The people who will be pushed over the edge by such trivial concerns will find any reason to justify killing Americans. Instead, the terrorists need to worry about how violating American sensibilities by killing 3000 innocent people will result in Navy Seals knocking down the doors of their refuge and putting two bullets in their heads...boom, boom.

Somehow I question if the Chinese will care about terrorist bases set up to annoy European or the US.

Take note of the shit poor record they had have up to this point in helping us deal with North Korea as a case in point.

It is because we personalize everything, you see that all over A2K were ideas are linked to the people who spoke them and then great effort is made to either support or diminish the speaker based upon our emotional reaction to what has been said. Intellectually we should know that Bin Laden has not been up to much in a long time, and that when we lop off the head of terrorist organizations that another one is grown rapidly, but emotionally killing Bin Laden feels like we have won, like the fight is over.

Bin Laden May Have Message From the Grave

Osama bin Laden may have one final message to deliver from his watery grave. Officials believe the late terror mastermind made a video or audio tape before his death, with instructions that it be released after his death...Bin Laden released several audio and video tapes in the decade following 9/11, usually exhorting al-Qaida followers to continue their jihad. Last year, in an audiotape addressed from Osama to Obama, he said "If it was possible to carry our messages to you by words we wouldn't have carried them to you by planes."
 http://www.nbcsandiego.com/blogs/us-world/ 
 

 
US official: New tape may be last from bin Laden
(AP) – 21 hours ago

WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. intelligence officials believe Osama bin Laden made a propaganda recording shortly before his death and expect that tape to surface soon.

It is unclear whether the tape is audio or video, but a U.S. official says that intelligence indicates it is already working its way through al-Qaida's media pipeline. The official said the timing was coincidental and there is no indication he knew U.S. forces were bearing down on him.

A new recording from bin Laden would provide a final word from the beyond grave for a terrorist who taunted the U.S. with recorded propaganda for years. It could also provide fodder to those who insist he is still alive.

Who knows whether such a tape even exists, but, if it does, I don't think it should ever be publicly aired by the media.

@roger,

I first came to this site because I wanted to know what the term 'white bread' meant. When I googled it, it popped up. I heard it on The Simpsons from the song everyone hates Ned Flanders. Apu says of Flanders 'He's so white bread.' I thought Apu was threatening to kill Flanders. Which I thought was a bit macabre for Apu. I don't think that now. The reason I thought it though was because of rhyming slang. A friend of mine once said of a neighbour. 'I told him, if he lit another bonfire when I put the washing out he was brown bread' Brown bread - Dead.

@roger,

Who is going to challenge them? Their peers who do it too?

Heard today that it's not just the media who can't get the details right.

John Brennan has been telling the media Osama used his wife as a human shield.
 
 
@Finn dAbuzz,

I think you're correct about quick-draw reporting. I think my interest in this event has shifted from interest in Osama to how it's being processed emotionally, and politically.

There has been reporting from the WH about national togetherness and bipartisanship etc. I agree, but maybe for different reasons. I've found no real trend in celebratory moods along political boundaries. A friend of mine whom I debate religion with rather frequently shared his Christian sentiments about the idea of celebrating death and how ugly it is quoting:

"In front of the death of man, a Christian never rejoices but rather reflects on the grave responsibility of each one in front of God and men, and hopes and commits himself so that every moment not be an occasion for hatred to grow but for peace."

-Father Federico Lombardi

While, not a Christian, I relate to this sentiment and I do feel a common unity with an ideology that in many other aspects of society I do not as often get to bond. I saw many liberal friends bond with many conservative friends with statements about dragging Osama's body behind a car.

I simply don't want to bond over that. I'd rather bond over what we build together, not simply a bond over who we share a common emotion: Hate.

There was one piece of commentary that struck me particularly striking. Thomas Friedman when discussing the American identity post 9/11, and our unity said this:

‎"Our day is not Sept 11th, our day is the Fourth of July."

I've reflected a lot about how defining 9/11 has been, and honestly, how that has moved us away from a real common heritage on something we built together. I'd rather see us bonding over that, not easily digestible villains. I think that's something that I'd not have to convince anyone on the other side of the fence is true.

I'm sure Obama will get a popularity bump for this. It was literally a campaign promise. I find myself wishing other campaign promises were what we were bonding over. He's still got my vote right now, and I'm not downplaying the symbolic victory, but I find myself still wanting more.

@ossobuco,

George ob. I see that the ship that did Osama's last rights was the CArl Vincent.
 
 
I don't really get what the quick-draw reporting is in reference to.

On A2K, we have a long history of being a sort of news aggregator during important events -- that goes back to actual 9/11, on Abuzz. Posting pertinent news reports as we see them.

I tend to come here first when there is any big event, read through quickly to see approximately where things are, then branch out to my usual sources to get more details and start adding them if they haven't already been added or if they seem to indicate that previous reports that had been posted were wrong.

I don't see anything wrong with that, nor with news organizations reporting things to the best of their knowledge, (so long as they have enough caveats about how certain they are about something/ where they got the info). It's the nature of these things to start out sketchy and not completely accurate and then start to become more specific and clear.
 
 
 http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2011/0503/Osama-bin-Laden-conspiracy-theories-race-across-the-world 

Osama bin Laden conspiracy theories race across the world
The quick burial of Osama bin Laden and the decision not to release photos of his body are sparking wild rumors, not just in Pakistan and the Arab world, but also in Europe and the US.

Less than 48 hours after the White House announced the killing of Osama bin Laden in Pakistan and his burial at sea, "conspiracy theories" are racing across the planet.

.The quick burial of Mr. bin Laden and the decision not to release photos of his body were part of a White House strategy to prevent revulsion throughout the Muslim world. But the lack of public proof of his death is sparking wild rumors, not just in Pakistan and the Arab world, but also in Europe and the US.

Among the radical assertions bouncing around the Internet: bin Laden was dead before the attack; he is still alive; the DNA that was supposed to be bin Laden's was inconclusive; and that the White House concocted a raid just to ensure President Obama's reelection. That's just to name a few.

The glut of conspiracy theories suggests a more general breakdown of traditional media’s authority in an era of text-messaging, Twitter, and instant “clarity” by far-flung experts, analysts say.

“More than simply a surfeit of conspiracy theory, [there is] a crisis of confidence between authorities and citizens," writes Bruno Fay, French author of a book on the spread of conspiracy theories called "Plot-ocracy," in the French magazine Nouvel Observateur. “Behind these plot concepts are all those who do not believe anymore in authorities. The situation today is: how to believe the authorities when bin Laden's death has not been transparent? By saying that, I am not saying that I believe in conspiracies.”

Mr. Fay notes that some 15 percent of people polled in a 2008 World Public Opinion survey managed by the Program on International Policy Attitudes at the University of Maryland felt the US was responsible for the 9/11 attack. Some 8 percent of French agreed, and the figure reached 40 percent in some Muslim-majority nations.

Much of what passes for “theories” the day after a dramatic story are often, in fact, personal extrapolations melded to fit strongly held beliefs based on unclear information and a broad new proclivity not to trust traditional media.

Indeed, “conspiracy” fits the times, analysts say. Former fringe story spinners – often racists or presumed odd balls – that believe the US moon landing was faked, or the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, or that 9/11 was a US “inside” plot, have given way to more acceptable cultish views in an age of 1,000 TV channels, social media, and WikiLeaks. Mass belief in alternate narratives is part of the 21st century zeitgeist.

Only last week, Mr. Obama put forward documentation from Hawaii that scotched a “birther” theory that asserts Obama was not born in the US. More than 40 percent of registered Republican voters believed that false assertion, brought to a head by tycoon Donald Trump, according to a recent CBS News/New York Times survey.

As for the conspiracy theories surrounding bin Laden's death, Special US Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan Mark Grossman was at a loss to explain them at a press conference in Islamabad today.

“I can’t answer every conspiracy theory [coming from] every place," said Mr. Grossman. "Osama

@farmerman,

Carl Vinson. Meanwhile my own question in re legal strictures for burials at sea was answered: Osama's body was weighed down by some unnamed load. Everybody and his kid brother has satellites, it's hard to conceal a carrier, so next thing that happens is wait for rental submarines to look for OBL's remains.

How broke are we, exactly? How deep is the Arabian Sea at that point? Can we rent out any submarines at exorbitant rates? Sorry - worrying about deficits  
 
 
@BillRM,

The Monitor's article you posted, BillRM, somewhat negated the need for a little essay I have mulling over today. But here are some remnants of what I have been thinking about.
The Photo
Humans tend to be visual. We, for whatever reason want to see the dead body of Osama in order to convince ourselves that what we hear is true. In American society, and perhaps in others, we have a morbid curiosity of things (which is why we tend to rubberneck at accident scenes.) And perhaps we distrust the government, and the media, much more than we did a few decades ago.
In any event the Obama people will probably resist releasing a photo of Osama with half his head blown away. It will not satisfy the domestic conspiracy theorists and will only inflame tense relations in other parts of the world.
What do you all think should be done;
> release the photo to the public
> show the photo to senior members of Congress
> show the photo to select media personnel
> show the photo to leaders of our allies and to Al-Qaeda
> other
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Somebody will leak the photo. I have no doubt at all.
 
 
According to Channel 4. There were some raids and arrests following a car stopped acting suspiciously by Sellafield nuclear powerstation the day after Bin Laden was killed. They say they don't think it's connected to Bin Laden, but they wouldn't be saying that if it was dissident republicans. This is in the UK by the way.

seeing Americans cheering in the street would have the same impact on them that their cheering did after 911 did on us
 
As for having the same impact, perhaps they managed to see how awful they looked to the west.

Survival is not a fair system, it is the only one that works and in the battle for one system something has to give. Or we have to accept each other.....tell the Jews not to worry about survival, the Arabs will accept them. In the meantime, it is war....brought on by those with far more hate in them then the people cheering the death of Rubbish bin Laden.

I have to say I found the news very unsatisfying.
 
Thats exactly the effect they were hoping for by releasing news of his death. They want to be able to continue the fight against terrorism and if they had of announced it years ago when he was really killed, how would they have maintained the emotional pressure to withstand years of war ?
 
 
@High Seas,

Hopefully the unnamed load was a couple of very large swine carcasses.

This business of giving him some form of Islamic burial rites is just silly.

I can guarantee you that when his corpse went over the side there was no shortage of sailors wishing him a fiery torment in hell.
 
 
@BillRM,

 
bin Laden was dead before the attack
 
Bingo. He was killed in Afghanistan and that is why they didnt follow up on requests to block off the border at the time. The request consisted of special forces manning mountain tops and directing attacks on anyone trying to escape into Pakistan....by allowing this escape route, they could keep him alive and the war going till it was won. They are very mindful of the failure of will in Vietnam.

Why time it now ? He has to die sometime and to have him fade was not a good idea.....however with elections coming up in the Arab countries, the timing will not get better.

So what was the truth behind this raid ? No idea...maybe the Taliban installed a look alike....though 6'4" Arabs are hard to come by especially in that part of the world. It was certainly a real raid and it killed people. But speculation is rather pointless.

Did anyone notice the calls to bring the troops home now ? How loud would that call have been if he died years ago ?

Whatever the truth is, he is DEFINITELY dead...deceased....passed on....gone to his maker.....pushing up daisies.....past tense.....the recently departed.....maggot bag.....food for the fishy's....burning in hell.

Yes, I see...Bush and Obama both tacitly, or otherwise, agreed to hide the known fact that Osama was killed many years ago, because they both realized a personal benefit from continuing a phony war on terrorism.

That must mean that the Bush administration faked all of those Osama videos we saw after Tora Bora. Diabolically brilliant!

Why limit your paranoia to hiding Osama's actual death? Why not blow the whole rotten mess wide open and reveal that Osama never masterminded 9/11? It was the CIA and the Jews!

Feel free to skip this. I am using up some thoughts.
I am a political junkie, chasing elections all over the place, from a district race in Arizona to a national race in wherever. I just got back from Canada. "Locals" tolerate me. I follow Msolga's thread about Australia.
Anyway, I wrote there - and perhaps here - about the American response to the news about the death of Osama. Particularly, I wrote about the response of a crowd in a baseball stadium in Philly when the news was announced. Older people and younger; people of various races and political pursuasions. I said it was good. It marked the end of a chapter, but certainly not the end of the book.

Msolga, the Aussie, pinned my ears back, noting that the chants of "USA#1" showed an incredible lack of sensitivity to the losses other countries, like those that Australia, Spain and Great Britain suffered. To say nothing of Iraq etc.
Failure Arts et al lamented the "frat boy-like" partying at Ground Zero and in front of the White House.
And I think the mainstream media picked up on that.
I take a certain comfort by something a lady from FL wrote today. She gets paid to write. She noted that the "frat boys" were 11 years old when 911 happened. For the 1st time in their lives, they saw fear in the faces of their parents. And, she said, stealing from Johnboy, this was the end of a chapter in their lives.

It was a group of Americans who went in at great risk and kill the SOB and therefore it was our achievement to be both proud of and to cerebrate.

I see nothing insulting to any other country for doing so and if it had been British special forces instead I would had seen nothing wrong with a similar cerebration by British crowds.

So come on people this complaining is bullshit.

"Bin Laden's killing a 'perversion of justice'

I like Set's answer to you about them attacking us because our soldiers were in Saudi Arabia. That was a major point of contention with the terrorists (even though we were there because the Saudis wanted us there to protect them from Saddam).

But they also attacked us because they wanted to set up a Taliban-style extremist government in all Islamic nations, they figured (correctly) we would act to oppose them if they tried to do that, and they figured (incorrectly) that 9/11 would intimidate us into not opposing them.

I'm just reading through, so someone may have said this already - but I think the most worrisome thing to me was the purported WH concern that Pakistan may scramble fighters and come after us if they found out we were in their airspace, planning for a raid on BL. They've been hiding him this whole time, it seems.
 

 http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2011/05/02/obama-to-make-statment-tonight-subject-unknown 

[Updated 11:09 am. ET] As the assault on bin Laden's compound commenced, the United States had a number of U.S. aircraft flying protective missions, according to a senior U.S. military official. None of the aircraft entered Pakistani airspace but they were prepared to do so if needed, the official told CNN.

These included fixed wing fighter jets that would have provided firepower if the team came under opposition fire it could not handle.

I've just taken the time to read every post in this thread, and what I think is being swept under the carpet here is the way us westerners are coming to accept that brutality and murder is the only rational way to deal with such situations.

Recently, a team of Mossad operatives assumed Australian identities to assassinate one of their country's political enemies. The outcry was not about the murder, but about the identity theft.

In this instance, military aggression was used in a peaceful urban area, and (if reports so far released can be believed) both women and young children were killed.

Can you appreciate how far down the evolutionary scale we have dropped to be applauding this kind of action?
 
 
@Builder,

@engineer,

 
 
I think there is a huge difference between cheering the death of one man, a figure head who is guilty of multiple murders and cheering the deaths of many innocents. I can accept people responding to it like they did, but I have trouble accepting the Arab world and their gloating over murder.
 

It all depends on your point of view. Those cheering American deaths likely did so because they believed Americans are responsible for killing others and it was justice being delievered to those who seemed to be beyond justice. I don't agree with that point of view but it is what it is.
 

I think people who cheered 9/11 should be targeted for drone airstrikes.

 
For those who hold that point of view, seeing Americans cheering in the street would have the same impact on them that their cheering did after 911 did on us.
 

There is no moral equivalence between "an extremist cheering the deaths of innocent civilians" and "an American cheering the death of a mass murderer".

@izzythepush,

 
Did you know that Iran was once a model democracy, until it was overthrown by the Shah in an American lead coup? You may not remember that but the Iranians do.
 

America was hardly responsible for the coup. We did what we could to prevent the UK from invading and toppling Iran's government, and it was only when Iran's clerics (the same clerics who later overthrew the Shah and who rule Iran today) also decided to try to overthrow the government that we went along with it as the "least bad" option.

And we continuously pressured the Shah to implement democratic reforms throughout the time he was in power.

 
Arabs have long memories. They're still going on about the bloody crusades.
 

Ah, the Crusades. That's when the Arabs invaded someone (the Roman Empire) who had done them no harm, and people rallied to try to repel the invaders.

Yes, I imagine it might be frustrating for Islamic invaders to have their victims try to resist being subjugated.

I first came to this site because I wanted to know what the term 'white bread' meant. When I googled it, it popped up. I heard it on The Simpsons from the song everyone hates Ned Flanders. Apu says of Flanders 'He's so white bread.' I thought Apu was threatening to kill Flanders. Which I thought was a bit macabre for Apu. I don't think that now. The reason I thought it though was because of rhyming slang. A friend of mine once said of a neighbour. 'I told him, if he lit another bonfire when I put the washing out he was brown bread' Brown bread - Dead.

The action itself, and the public reaction to it, were disquieting to say the least.

Here's yesterday's cartoon.

 
 
 
According to the AP, OBL was unarmed when he was killed.

 http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_BIN_LADEN?SITE=PASCR&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT 

 
Osama bin Laden, the al-Qaida leader who liked to pose with a menacing AK-47 assault rifle in his hand or by his side, was discovered without a gun by the Navy SEALs who barged into his room and shot him dead
 

 
Panetta underscored that Obama had given permission to kill the terrorist leader: "The authority here was to kill bin Laden," he said. "And obviously, under the rules of engagement, if he had in fact thrown up his hands, surrendered and didn't appear to be representing any kind of threat, then they were to capture him. But they had full authority to kill him."

@McTag,

I get what the writer was saying, but frankly, he's missing some perspective on control methods.

Citing the Taliban operating toll roads and Hezbollah runningn schools and hospitals is a good argument, but incomplete in terms of human psychology when considering why people endorse these groups.

As an example, we might examine a low income, gang infested neighborhood in Compton, Los Angeles in the 90s. To the gang members themselves (the low ranking ones), they might view themselves as righteous protectors of their neighborhood (an altruistic motivator), and might justify this by thinking that their civic authorities don't care about them, protect them, or even conspire against them. They might even be right about these things. They conduct their operations, and feel at some level justified, and non-gang members in the neighborhood are taught to fear civil authorities like the police, and never rat out your neighborhood's protectors. After all, if you buy into the idea that the neighborhood across the tracks is your primary threat, and that the police won't help you, you may see them as tarnished, but ultimately acceptable knights. Even if they invite chaos and violence to your street. So even while all this is happening, someone in the formula is making money, and gaining power, and their motives are not so altruistic. I'm sure their rhetoric they use to build loyalty sounds good. Lots of Robin hood mythology in most violent criminal orgs I would guess.

The birth of Al Qu'aeda happened during the latter days of the cold war, when the US admin was worried that Russia was going to infiltrate Afghanistan. The call was put out to recruit the most radical Moslems on the planet, the Mujahedin, and they were trained and equipped by the US to take out a superpower (Russia) with home-made bombs, and shoulder-mounted rockets. It worked. Very well. Their training was just an add-on to their fierce hatred of the Russians.

Balderdash.

First, zero US aid went to al-Qa'ida. The fighters from al-Qa'ida got all their funding from rich Saudis.

Second, the people who did get US aid (the Taliban) were not selected or recruited by the US. Rather, the US just gave the money to Pakistan to distribute as they saw fit, and Pakistan chose to create the Taliban out of local Afghani fighters.
 
 
@oralloy,

 http://terrorism.about.com/od/warinafghanistan/ss/AfghanistanWar_3.htm 

The U.S.-funded Afghan insurgents were called mujahideen, an Arabic word that means "strugglers" or "strivers." The word has its orgins in Islam, and is related to the word jihad, but in the context of the Afghan war, it may be best understood as referring to "resistance."

The mujahideen were organized into different political parties, and armed and supported by different countries, including Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, as well as the United States, and they gained significantly in power and money during the course of the Afghan-Soviet war.

The legendary fierceness of the mujahideen fighters, their stringent, extreme version of Islam and their cause—expelling the Soviet foreigners—drew interest and support from Arab Muslims seeking an opportunity to experience, and experiment with, waging jihad.

Among those drawn to Afghanistan were a wealthy, ambitious, and pious young Saudi named Osama bin Laden and the head of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad organization, Ayman Al Zawahiri.

Yes. Saudi Arabia financed al-Qa'ida. And the US gave money to Pakistan, who used it to finance the Taliban. Just as I said.

It was a group of Americans who went in at great risk and kill the SOB and therefore it was our achievement to be both proud of and to cerebrate.
 

Great risk, yeah right. Like the great risk all those bomber jockeys take bombing civilians from 35,000 feet. Or the great risk all those pilots who napalmed villages took or the great risk that all those troops took lining up old men, women and children and gunning them down, or the great risk that those troops took when, after watching women and children go into safety bunkers to escape the US/Aus artillery being rained down on their homes, tossed some grenades in after them.

Or perhaps you mean the great risk that was involved in bombing civilians in Laos and Cambodia?

That's the problem with y'all and it's especially acute with idiots like you, Bill, you just don't ever bother to "cerebrate". If you actually did do some "cerebrating", you would send the vast numbers of war criminals that live in the US to a huge prison in some useless desert portion of the US, maybe, Las Vegas.

@failures art,

 
Citing the Taliban operating toll roads and Hezbollah runningn schools and hospitals is a good argument, but incomplete in terms of human psychology when considering why people endorse these groups.
 

Al Capone bankrolled soup kitchens on a very large scale in Chicago in the 1930s still that does not mean he was a good man or should not had been put out of business by the government.
 
 
 
A reporter asked Carney "which of those women was being used a human shield, as Mr. Brennan suggested yesterday." Carney answered: "The woman I believe you're talking about might have been the one on the first floor who was caught in the crossfire. Whether or not she was being used as a shield or trying to use herself as a shield or simply caught in crossfire is unclear." What's clear is that Bin Laden, who was upstairs, couldn't have used her as a shield.
Carney blamed the misleading early reports on the "fog of war." But a fog of war creates confusion, not a consistent story like the one about the human shield. The reason U.S. officials bought and sold this story is that it fit their larger indictment of Bin Laden. It reinforced the shameful picture of him hiding in a mansion while sending others to fight and die. It made him look like a coward.
This is the narrative that's really at stake. A narrative isn't just a chronology. It's a tale woven with themes. For 20 years, Bin Laden peddled a tale of oppression and jihad. In elaborate video and audio messages, he depicted al-Qaida's trail of bombings as a Muslim struggle against Western persecution. He wasn't just a terrorist. He was a storyteller.
That's the story Brennan sought to undermine when he cited Bin Laden's use of a human shield to show "how false his narrative has been over the years." Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also targeted Bin Laden's story. In a statement trumpeting his death, she argued that "people across the Middle East and North Africa are rejecting the extremist narratives and charting a path of peaceful progress." Carney, too, warned against false interpretations. "It would be a shame," he warned, if Bin Laden's killing "became a piece in a partisan narrative."
Carney is right. So are Brennan, Clinton, and Cameron. Bin Laden was a delusional mass murderer, and his narrative was false. But you can't debunk one false narrative with another. The firefight at Bin Laden's compound, it now appears, pitted two or three men against a dozen or more commandos. Bin Laden didn't engage in the firefight and used no human shield. He wasn't even armed. We shot him dead anyway. That's the truth. Deal with it.

Yep, and I saw also claims that the Pakistani national forces showed up in force to take over the compound as soon as the Americans departed....Obama might have trouble with his story that we never told Pakistan before the action. The lack of local police response also puts this assertion into question.

And yes, there is a constant whine from the US, this constant hypocritcal attempt to demonize others for the very things that the US leads the world in; terrorism and brutal interference in other countries' affairs.

But hopefully, this could help to enlighten the large mass of ignorance that reside in the US, who knows, maybe even Cy.

They did not even roll to the scene..what you say is possible but I find it to be unlikely.

Also

 
JEFFREY BROWN: And to that point, are you hearing any anger expressed or frustration, or whatever word you pick, expressly about that, that it was a U.S. military operation in Pakistan?

SAIMA MOHSIN: Well, as news of his death is starting to sink in here in Pakistan, as it is right across the world, the questions are now starting to be asked: How is it that he was here in Abbottabad? How is it that U.S. forces themselves came on to Pakistani soil?

We've heard that turn of phrase so many times: Boots on the ground are unacceptable. Pakistan's sovereignty should not be breached.

And of course, officials will always perhaps come out and say, it's unacceptable, but as we have seen with the drone attacks, the Pakistani people feel that perhaps officials turn a blind eye to this. And local people are saying this to me today, that it couldn't be possible that they didn't know about it.

However, this is the sentiment here. There is anger that United States felt that it could come right directly on to Pakistani soil.
 
 http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/terrorism/jan-june11/overview2_05-02.html 

I take "it" to refer to the assassination mission, and posit that Pakistani's should have a good intuitive sense of how deeply their government in complicit.
 
 
@hawkeye10,

 
They did not even roll to the scene..what you say is possible but I find it to be unlikely.
 

So you think that police cars would roll up outside of a compound with military gunships overhead?

I think that is very unlikely even in the US and in Pakistan when the gunships having US markings it even more unlikely.

It is not the job of any police force to deal with an ongoing military situation.

This is a military town, the Americans were there for 40 minutes, and nobody rolls to find out what is going on...so see if their help is required?? I would believe that if it was known that this was the Americans, but team Obama says that they never made a call until the birds were in the air after the mission was completed.

The sequencing of events sounds off, I am betting that Obama will have to "walk back" his story some.
 
 
@Ionus,

I admit that following what you are trying to say with your posts is often difficult and so I suppose it's possible that I misread the several of them that suggest you believe Osama was actually killed years ago and this recent mission was a faked affair.

So...did I misread them and do you believe that Osama was alive last week?
 
 
@hawkeye10,

I would believe that if it was known that this was the Americans, but team Obama says that they never made a call until the birds were in the air after the mission was completed.
 

Being a military town or not being a military town does not give the police any added abilities to deal with three gunships.

Next I am fairly sure those gunships have large US markings on them so no call would be needed to let the local Pakistanis know that the US military is paying a call.

Oh I am also fairly sure that not even any local military commander is going to take the responsibilities to fire on US warplanes without it being clear all the way to the top and that take time and the message from Obama was likely to had arrived in that time frame.

One other note if I was planning this there would be top cover for those gunships just for the worst case situation that someone did take responsibilities to try to interfere with that operation.

Both you and Farmer have been making the same lame excuses for US war crimes/instances of mass murder/extensive use of torture/... while decrying the tiny, by comparison, actions of OBL. He hadn't even been indicted. The FBI didn't list 9-11 as one of the actions he was involved in.

The Taliban had offered him up a number of times and yet, you sit quietly, except to jump on the "Alright America!" lunacy bandwagon, not mentioning that Afghanistan and Iraq have paid a terrible price for doing absolutely nothing to the US.

After bin Laden
Implications for U.S. Policy in Afghanistan and Pakistan

 
SOURCE: AP/Pablo Martinez Monsivais

By Caroline Wadhams, Colin Cookman | May 3, 2011

The May 1, 2011, raid that killed fugitive Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden has the potential to reshape world events across a range of relationships and countries, including our complicated ties with Pakistan and Afghanistan, as well as the internal political upheaval taking place in the Arab world, in which Al Qaeda has largely been bypassed.

Within the United States the Obama administration now has an opportunity to lead a serious reassessment of the past 10 years of American security policy, particularly the degree to which it has become distorted around Al Qaeda and the person of bin Laden himself. This is a distortion most powerful in our discussion of U.S. interests and activities in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Bin Laden’s death does not mean the United States should declare “mission accomplished” in Afghanistan or end our targeted counterterrorism efforts in Pakistan. But it does offer the Obama administration an opportunity to reassess the challenges in Afghanistan beyond the specter of Al Qaeda, to reduce our military and financial investments, and to realign our approach around a political track in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the region.

Osama bin Laden’s death clarifies that the United States has the ability to protect U.S. interests independent of Afghan and Pakistani cooperation. Afghan political leaders and commanders have extracted substantial support from the United States over the past decade predicated on the idea that their cooperation against Al Qaeda is so invaluable that America cannot risk alienating them. To a lesser degree, so too have their counterparts in Pakistan. The costs of these rentier relationships (both financially and in terms of the distortionary effect it has on the internal political dynamics in both countries) and the question of who depends on whom the most in the partnership needs to be seriously reevaluated after bin Laden’s removal.

If Afghan and Pakistani leaders do not move on some of the essential political reforms required for long-term peace, then the United States should exercise the option to reduce its financial and military support and presence at a faster rate than the current 2014 timeline indicates. We do not have to be held captive by Afghan and Pakistani leaders because of our fears surrounding Al Qaeda. The capture and killing of Osama bin Laden may allow us to put this threat into perspective.

The Obama administration has placed the disruption and defeat of Al Qaeda as the central goal of its policy toward both Afghanistan and Pakistan, but Al Qaeda has been a minor player in Afghanistan for some time due to our sustained assault on the network—especially over the past two years. Indeed, bin Laden’s death is unlikely to have a direct impact on:

* The strength of the Taliban insurgency in either nation
* The weakness of President Hamid Karzai’s government
* Pakistan’s contentious relations with its neighbors and growing nuclear program
* Islamabad’s inability to mobilize public resources to address its economic and financial crises

There are broader concerns for the United States in both countries than just Al Qaeda.

With or without Al Qaeda, the United States has an interest in a peaceful Afghanistan and Pakistan that serves regional and international stability and does justice to the investments we have made there. In order to pursue this, the United States needs to seek a political solution to the conflict in Afghanistan and support a transition process to Afghan leadership that more directly addresses the exclusivity, unsustainability, and ineffectiveness of the current balance of power that constitutes the Afghan government. Altering this will require a political reform agenda, negotiations with high-level insurgents, reconciliation at the local level, and regional dialogue.

Pakistan’s leaders—military, civilian, and intelligence—must cooperate with this effort in open and meaningful ways. It is in their best interest to do so, and their relationship with many militant groups means they may possess levers of influence that could bring some to the negotiating table. If they do not because of misguided and misplaced efforts to prepare for worries about Indian influence in Afghanistan after U.S. forces withdraw, then the United States needs to be prepared to impose consequences on those parts of the Pakistani state that continue to obstruct U.S. interests.

All of these efforts are the products of American political and economic leverage, not military operations. They require a recalibration of our national security portfolio, both in regards to how it is structured in Afghanistan, in Pakistan, in the region, and around the world. This shift requires engaging with Afghanistan and Pakistan as countries with their own unique internal challenges.

A concerted effort is required to manage the shift in our investments to a more sustainable level and to reduce the enormous dependencies we have sponsored in Afghanistan through a drawdown in U.S. forces over the course of the next three years. Bin Laden’s death eliminates a major threat to the United States but it does not eliminate the need to seek a sustainable political settlement in Afghanistan that is supported by all of the responsible political players in Pakistan.

Bin Laden killing was legally justified, Holder says
'It was a kill or capture mission... He made no attempts to surrender'

xupdated 36 minutes ago 2011-05-04T18:57:44
Share Print Font: +-The killing of Osama bin Laden was legally justified, and would have been even if the al-Qaida leader had made some sign that he wished to surrender, Attorney General Eric Holder said Wednesday.

.."The operation in which Osama bin Laden was killed was lawful," Holder told the Senate Judiciary Committee. "He was the head of al-Qaida, an organization that had conducted the attacks of September 11th. He admitted his involvement and he indicated that he would not be taken alive. The operation against bin Laden was justified as an act of national self defense."

Video: Officials: Bin Laden unarmed when shot (on this page)
Holder said bin Laden was a legitimate military target and he had made no attempt to surrender to the U.S. forces that stormed his fortified compound near Islamabad on Monday. He was shot in the chest and head.

It was lawful to target an enemy commander in the field and the mission was conducted in the way that was consistent with U.S. laws and values, Holder testified, adding that it was a "kill or capture mission."

"If he had attempted to surrender, I think we should obviously have accepted that, but there was no indication that he wanted to do that. And therefore his killing was appropriate," Holder said.

U.S. acknowledgment on Tuesday that bin Laden was unarmed when killed had raised accusations Washington had violated international law. Exact circumstances of his death remained unclear.

Story: Was it right to kill bin Laden?
Five people were killed in the raid, officials said: bin Laden; his son, Khalid; his most trusted courier, a man who used the nom de guerre Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti; and al-Kuwaiti's wife and brother. The latest White House account leaves open the question of whether there was any gunfire from bin Laden's defenders in his room before the commandos shot him.

Story: Should bin Laden have been captured and tried?
Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said "you have to believe this guy was a walking IED," and that any of the Navy SEALs would have wanted to kill bin Laden as far away as possible from the other members of the American team.

The attorney general agreed with Graham that there was a sound legal basis for the raid.

"It was a kill or capture mission," Holder said, adding "He made no attempts to surrender, and I tend to agree with you that even if he had, there would be a good basis on the part of those very brave Navy Seal team members to do what they did in order to protect themselves and the other people who were in that building."

Holder was under a second day of oversight questioning on Capitol Hill; Tuesday he was questioned by the House Judiciary Committee.

Even as many European leaders congratulated the U.S. government on the operation, many said the slaying was of symbolic value. They pointed out that the terror cells working in Europe have long functioned independently and may try to avenge bin Laden's death.

"The fight against terrorism and extremism has, of course, not ended with this," German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said earlier in the week in Berlin.

Reuters and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Wow, this might actually turn out the way I want for once.

 
The Obama administration is seeking to use the killing of Osama bin Laden to accelerate a negotiated settlement with the Taliban and hasten the end of the Afghanistan war, according to U.S. officials involved in war policy.

Administration officials think it could now be easier for the reclusive leader of the largest Taliban faction, Mohammad Omar, to break his group’s alliance with al-Qaeda, a key U.S. requirement for any peace deal. They also think that bin Laden’s death could make peace talks a more palatable outcome for Americans and insulate President Obama from criticism that his administration would be negotiating with terrorists.

My point was that you don't know what was going through the minds and hearts of all who witnessed the burial. If there was cheering at the burial ceremony, which may or may not be true, and that I somewhat doubt, even an outward cheerer in a group of cheerers may have somber thoughts. I do imagine there was satisfaction.

And no, good grief, I don't want to be held to a literal interpretation of every figure of speech I use. That would fetter my feathers.
 
 
@ossobuco,

Clearly I don't know what is going on in the minds and hearts of anyone, but I certainly can speculate, and with a great degree of certainty assume that of the men and women on that ship who knew what was being tossed overboard, most, if not all of them, were hoping he would not rest in peace.
