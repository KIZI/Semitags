 
 
The Norway incident and the real lesson from it.
 
 
Lets keep this as short and to the point as possible. Ok, the Norway incident happened, it was horrific, it was illegal and murder in its most reckless form. Yet, many agree with the core ideas the suspect put forward. Point, it does not make the ideas illegal, the guy was insane but what made an intelligent man come to the conclusion that this was the only way to draw attention to the perceived problem of Muslims? I reiterate, he was insane. But, the guy had a point.

The left wing liberal pro immigration population has bullied alternate views for too long and this is discrimination too. People aren't allowed to speak anymore without fear of being branded racists, just look at the responses on TSR. "Oh you're racist, you're an idiot because you oppose multiculturalism". Well, sorry, we live in a liberal democracy and this means i will argue my points with evidence and expect others to do the same. Not for some idiot to say 'oh you're so racist, let the Muslims do whatever they want because its fair'.

I urge you to read this document from the suspect:
 http://www.kevinislaughter.com/wp-co...dependence.pdf 
Read it with an open mind, bear in mind that a lot of what he says is crazy drivel. Also bear in mind that some of what he has to say also had truth to it, and is something that people shouldn't run away from anymore.

I'd also like you to ask you 4 questions:
-Do you think it is acceptable that Muslims feel they can emigrate en masse to other countries and treat it as if they are above the law? (on a cultural and legal sense: e.g. whole sections of Swedish cities being filled with jobless immigrants/extremists. Scandanavian rape statistics. Yes, you will oppose this point i have put with the most ferocity, but there is no smoke without fire... nothing in this matter is 100% correct, nor is it 100% false. The prevalent point is that an unusually high amount of Muslims fit into these associations).
-To Non Muslims, how do you feel natives of Muslim nations would feel if you emmigrated en masse to their countries as behaved on the same level of disrespect for the society that they do?
-Do you seriously think all oppositions to Muslim immigration are crazy right wing fundamentalists? If so, do you realise your own ignorance and "generalisation"? (Yes, your favourite word).
-Have you ever questioned your own views, really?
 
 
possibly

he bought attention to a muslim immigration / crime problem I previously did not know about
 
 
Well said.

Look at what "multiculturalism" did for India. Multiculturalism is a parasite that infects a society and then slowly but surely splits it up into warring factions.

The success of multiculturalism automatically infers the failure of multiculturalism, because it is the very nature of different cultures to separate out.

Society is like a jar of oil and different cultures are like drops of water being added to that jar of oil. The left wing lunatics keep on shaking the jar, forcing a false, temporary mixture of the two, but it is, and always will be, in their nature to separate and detest one another.
 
 
is there anyone on this forum that SUPPORTS multiculturalism

I cant seem to find one
 
 
 
Muslims shoot up children= all Muslims get blamed

Crazy Right-Wing Christian shoots up Children= All Muslims get blamed.

You people are ****ing pathetic.

 

Wrong. Left wing multiculturalists get blamed. If it wasn't for those scum, the children would still be alive - end of story.

Let us make a distinction straight away, early on in this thread as to avoid confusion regarding my point.

I do not oppose the people. Therefore i do not oppose other ethnicities. I oppose their cultures invading the native culture, i oppose multiculturalism but not different racial groups because to oppose a racial group is illogical and blindly racist.

Multicultural /=/ Multi ethnic

Typical left wing, ignorant bully shouting profanities and insulting people. Maybe if you people actually listened instead of just screaming your own opinion we wouldn't have so much conflict in our society.
 
 
so you are not supporting multiculturalism ?

I will be reading the document soon but it's 1500 pages long so perhaps it's not something for me to comment on right now. I agree with you insofar as to say that a lot of right wing opinion, in my view, has been stifled. It is surprising that you will get negative reactions or at least disagreements from people when this is stated but I often feel that at least in this country, people become on edge or a little more alert when these 'sensitive issues' are brought up and opinions which are often branded intolerant are discussed.

So first of all, it's not intolerant to entertain any of these ideas. In fact it's completely tolerant to entertain them. What's intolerant is to follow through with blind ignorance, on any view point, your personal perception of any issue. What people should do in a normal society, in my opinion, is listen. A lot of the time, that doesn't happen.

So, your four questions.

I don't think it's acceptable for anyone to believe they are above any law personally. It doesn't matter to me whether that person is Muslim or not. Disagree with legislation and provide improvements, of course. But to act above the law without question and without considering the risk and implication is reckless in my view. I've dealt with one of the papers citing Swedish rape cases. If there is only one, I find the notion to be flawed. I do not believe all Muslims, or even a significant minority, to be extremists. They are, of course, jobless, but then the whole point of an economic migrant is to find one and provide income for the national economy. Also, I wouldn't extrapolate rape cases to prefigure the entire Muslim population or even huge swathes of it.

I believe that most Muslim nations would treat me with a degree of respect in terms of legislature. Culturally, it varies according to the economic climate of where you settle as well as your job and education. Not forgetting your ethnic roots but I believe most Muslim countries will have the same degree of racism that we have in our country.

I don't think anything ill of people who are opposed to immigration and I can quite clearly see the reasons and potential benefits of it. However, a specific targeting of Muslims in terms of immigration makes virtually no logical sense to me and seems an absurd notion. I wouldn't call the person suggesting it ignorant or any other number of names because I don't think any form of conflict is going to resolve the situation.

I don't have one set of views that ascribe to any particular ideology or creed so my views naturally change as I learn more. How about you?

Get your facts straight. Nobody is justifying the act, but justifying the cause behind the act.

A while ago, some extremists dug up and desecrated a corpse, because the dead person was a scientist who performed experiments on live animals. I agree with the cause, I do not agree with the act. Get it?
 
 
I hope this is a joke. What does this have to with Islam?

I love the way that even when a White Blond Hair Blue Eyed person commits an act of terror, it is still somehow connected to Muslims.

So your cause is to purge all left wing/multicultural elements from your society? that's supposed to make you look better?

It's clear stormfront has started to send out its goons on a PR mission.

Multiculturalism has existed in India since the days of the Kama Sutra.

Incidentally, the most multireligious state in India (Kerala) is also the most progressive and has the highest levels of education provision and literacy compared to the others.

you only have to look at TSR today as well as some of the articles in the comments part of papers to realize that people with such viewpoints are not prevented from doing so. We have political parties in all european countries which have a strong anti-immigration or anti-islam emphasis and this is even encouraged in some publications such as prominently describing a perpetrator of some horrific crime as muslim purely on the grounds that his name is Aziz or something. In short, no-one is "banned" from expressing such views. Some people may make damning comments when such view points are stated by individuals, but you only have to look on here today to see how people like Lightfoot and this Marcus guy apply the same instantly dismissing comments to people who utter anything that is perceived as centre of left, being called "loonies" and such.

Im going to read this guy's "manifesto" even though I am disgusted by what he has done and the small snippets of his views that I have seen on the news, because dismissing someone as being mad completely simplifies the situation and we throw away another chance to understand why exactly he thought he had the right to take away the lives of so many people because of what he personally believed in. the real lesson here is that deliberately divisive politics can be carried to an extreme and a) no-one has the right to ruin and destroy so many lives in order to fit their ideas and b) life is so precious and should be beyond this pettiness. In before I too am descried as a "lefty loony" purely because I am not blaming immigrants, muslims, gordon brown, rising house prices, chavs or whatever for this horrible, horrible event.

 
Muslims shoot up children= all Muslims get blamed

Crazy Right-Wing Christian shoots up Children= All Muslims get blamed.

 

The irony of this also strikes me. if one was to try and throw some understanding on the 9/11 bombers motivations beyond the "they want our freedoms" rhetoric then they get shot down as some sort of islamist sympathizer. however it appears in some peoples minds it doesnt apply the other way around and one guy's dislike of change somehow justifies the cold blooded murder of nearly 100 people. although as stated it is good to get an understanding of why these crimes are committed, neither justifies the murder of innocent people.

It is not connected to Muslims.

It is entirely the fault of the yellow-haired white guy. He carried the gun. He opened fire.

I think the reference is the to the website which, as far as I know, in the nature of a forum can encompass many views. There is in fact a thread on the subject discussed on the forum and it seems general consensus is that the move was a step backwards (because they killed 'our brothers and sisters'). Most views admittedly seem to be coming at the issue from a racial angle but I would imagine culture figures into a lot of these racial ideals and so the aims of the European Knights Templar might chime with some of the users on Stormfront.
 
 
The shooter hates Muslims and immigration, so he decides to blow up his fellow, young countrymen and his government. Wow. Best act of patriotism ever.

The killer was nothing more than a pure criminal with a highly idiotic and superfluous agenda.

Again, ignorant. Look at what cultural differences did to India:

 
The Partition of India (Hindi: भारत का विभाजन Bhārat ka vibhajan), (Urdu: تقسیمِ بھارت Taqsim-e-Bharat), (Punjabi: ਭਾਰਤ ਦਾ ਬਟਵਾਰਾ Bhārat dā ban̐ṭvārā), (Bengali: ভারত বিভাজন Bhārot bibhajon) was the partition of British India on the basis of religious demographics that led to the creation on 15 August 1947 of the sovereign states of the Dominion of Pakistan (later the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the People's Republic of Bangladesh) and the Union of India (later Republic of India).

Stormfront is nothing more than a group of small-dicked, angry, racist redneck old men. I detest them for the very fact that their views overlap with, and thus pollute those of the rational anti-multiculturalist such as myself.

I disagree that right wing views are as easily heard on the media. Of course it would be hard to argue that there is no platform for them at all but in the main, I think Western media outlets tend field a lot of criticism towards right wing opinions roughly from about the moderate right wing end of the spectrum (from UKIP onwards, to give an example).

Your other points are quite perceptive, in my view, however.

Really? Is it really all the fault of the white blonde haired guy? Surely if a well educated and someone who was willing to carry out such an extensive/costly research project had a genuine cause for his worries?

I totally disagree with his actions, they are regrettable. But it doesn't mean i disagree with the core rationale behind the ideas he puts forward. His actions were an example of pressure group tactics going too far. But i feel the problem was, as he says, the governments and the fear/apathy in society.
 
 
 
How ignorant. I suggest you go and do some actual research about why he did it instead of just posting nonsense - you clearly have no idea what you're talking about.

 

He did it because he was a deranged psychopath. There are plenty of people who are critics of multuculturalism and immigration policies of numerous states. They don't go out and shoot 90+ Norwegians though.

If you think people will be suddenly discussing immigration and multiculturalism far more as a result of this event you are mistaken. Most mainstream websites discussions focus far more on the threat that white nationalist pose to Norway's citizens and Europe's citizens.

Again, ignorant. Look at what cultural differences did to India:

 

 

Those cultural differences were present before Partition. There was widespread violence between princely states through-out Indian history prior to Partition.

There was hardly any violence in the South between Hindus, Moslems, Christians, Jews, Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains.

Even today, there are more Moslems in India (which is a majority Hindu country) than there in Pakistan or Bangladesh. Levels of violence between Hindus and Muslims are nowhere near comparable to the levels of intra-religious violence between Muslims in western regions of Pakistan.

Most Moslems resident in India will find they have significant Hindu ancestry if they go back 5-6 centuries.
 
 
 
He did it because he was a deranged psychopath.

 

When will these loonies realise that it's this exact bigoted, "my views are automatically superior to your view" attitude which is the cause for this kind of conflict?

I detest the man for what he did, and if I had the power to I would go back in time and kill/restrain him before he even stepped foot out of his house that morning. But that does not at all affect the cause behind the act.

See the previous example about the extremists who dug up a body of the scientist who experimented on animals. I detest the act, I agree with the cause. Does that make me an extremist? Of course not.
 
 
Do they not have a BNP equivalent in Norway? Your post seems to suggest many people agree with the core ideas of the suspect. Why aren't they voting for a far right wing government then? Is voting not anonymous in Norway?

They are probably brainwashed by the left wing media. It's the only logical explanation. Damn them and their brainwashing! This is why I wear a tin foil hat. These leftys are crazy I tell you!

The "real lesson" has nothing to do with multiculturalism (his motives) and everything to do with why an apparently regular guy who went clubbing with friends and got drunk decided to GO ON A SHOOTING SPREE AND KILL 84 PEOPLE, many of them kids, many of them crawling away from him, begging for their lives, stripping to be able to swim away.

**** your rational arguments, try to put this tragedy into perspective.
 
 
 
Really? Is it really all the fault of the white blonde haired guy? Surely if a well educated and someone who was willing to carry out such an extensive/costly research project had a genuine cause for his worries?

 

You clearly haven't thought this through at all  

Clearly this guy has some serious mental issues, whether he is intelligent or not. Just because people are intelligent it doesn't mean that they act rationally all the time. There is no link between being clever and your opinions being justifiable. Why would you even think that?! He's not even that well educated anyway, just a MBa or something. People waste their money on all sorts of gash, the amount of money he spent on it has nothing to do with it either.

Yes. It is exclusively the fault of the yellow-haired white male in question. If it was not, there would be numerous other people prosecuted.

There are plenty of people who share his views who do not resort to violence. If anything, his actions will lead to most Norwegians becoming more hostile to those views.

Cultural differences between a typical Indian Muslim and a typical Indian Hindu are tiny in comparison to cultural differences between a typical European and a typical Pakistani Muslim immigrant.

Unless this has already been answered, the far right Norwegian party is, I think, the second or third largest in the country. It is the Progress Party which, incidentally, the killer attended the founding ceremony of.

we have just seen the beginning of a large drive to shorten the hands of the welfare state, making immigration laws even tougher than they were already made to be in order to pander to that part of society and senior politicians such as merkel and cameron (which is ironic because back in 2007 he wrote an article saying how he believed the british public could learn from muslim values) that Muslims and immigrants dont do enough to integrate and therefore I disagree with you. Thanks for the positive comment though  

BNP are given a raw deal in the media (even by papers of whom target BNP voters read strangely) yes, but I see few papers criticising ukip?

Agreeing with the cause is irrelevant. There may be plenty of people who share his views but who do not commit the level of violence he committed. Nobody suggested that you specifically were an extremist.

People are no more likely to discuss immigration and multiculturalism as a result of his actions - if anything they are far more likely to be discussing the threat that white racists pose to Norway's and Europe's population, as is reflected in most news websites.

As an admirer of Islam and an opponent of multiculturalism, I am somewhat unique and stuck between a rock and a hard place, you might say.

All I know is this - take 2 radically different cultures, and force them to co-exist within a nation, and you will soon have violence, hatred, and separation.

Why violence and hatred? Why not just 'separation'? Most people, regardless of their political affiliations are keen to live their lives avoiding violence and hatred, though would be more than comfortable to separate themselves they did not like engaging in.
 
 
Why are people standing up for multiculturilism, what does it bring to a country?

I'm sure the majority of people have no problem with immigrants, what they don't enjoy is when that immigrants culture starts to grow like a tumour in a part of their country.
They don't like it when the government doesn't give a crap and just watches as sharia law, or something equivalent, is secretly administered.
They don't like it when the government lets people spread hate for a country, whilst living in it and being protected by police officers, I mean seriously, there's the right to protest and then there's spreading hate.

History proves it, and not only that, but it's simply human nature.

2 radically different cultures cannot exist side by side, they are oil and water.

Multiculturalism is a nice, pretty word, Balkanisation is the not so nice result of it.

I agree with you. Any kind of coercion is going to lead to a bad result. In my view, that's the root of the problem, not multiculturalism. Multiculturalism has ingrained itself fairly well into this country for centuries when it wasn't consciously promoted. There were, of course, some racial tensions but none on the scale to which we are witnessing right now. I think the problem is forcing multiculturalism to exist when really, cultures will eventually coexist if you give them enough time to naturally develop boundaries and friendship. It's as if the pace was forced and some horrific consequences have come about as a result which is a real shame.

I agree with you. A lot of this immigration legislation is a stunt being pulled by those who wish to appease the people who give them their power. The term is  bread and circuses  and it is astonishing that in economic empires today, the same practice continues. Immigration needn't necessarily be halted but the figures are being scaled down to appeal to the public. A solution I think could easily be fixed by showing in a clear, presentable format, the facts and figures. As far as not integrating, read my post above your quote for a response to that.

I would say UKIP is actually a moderate version of a Thatcherite government so I would be careful of tarring them with the same brush as the BNP. The BNP do get given a raw deal but from my experience of them, they do no favours to change this. A lot of members don't present clear, cohesive arguments as to why immigration can and should be stopped; and there are valid arguments. As a result, biased papers slam such opinions because they have little weight behind them.
 
 
 
History proves it, and not only that, but it's simply human nature.

2 radically different cultures cannot exist side by side, they are oil and water.

Multiculturalism is a nice, pretty word, Balkanisation is the not so nice result of it.

 

How 'radically different' do these cultures have to be?

Most cultures in the world have many common denominators - most are family-based, most have festivals, most have entertainment based on similar principles, most are a mixture of capitalist and socialist. Most metropolises in the world are very multiethnic. Even ones with a clearly dominant ethnicity are evidently multicultural too.

Most civil strife is usually caused by economic factors rather than cultural diversity, no?
 
 
 
That's exactly what I was going to say lol... Muslims can't seem to get out of this one hah.

 

It is just that alot of white extremists cannot accept that one of their number is capable of exactly the same violence that Islamist extremists are capable of.
 
 
 
Yes. It is exclusively the fault of the yellow-haired white male in question. If it was not, there would be numerous other people prosecuted.

There are plenty of people who share his views who do not resort to violence. If anything, his actions will lead to most Norwegians becoming more hostile to those views.

 

I will respond to this in a couple of hours. Need some sleep.

Its not muslim immigrants its all the non white immigrant groups who have changed Europe into a dangerous place and unless we do something soon Europe and other white countries will never be like they once were much more peacful domestically.

Be careful who you call white extremists because me and others with my views dont want to be tagged with a pro Jewish person as it seems he is.

Well in communities before the third world immigration started in 1950's England was actually a nice place and you could walk around inner city streets feeling safe but now especially in London you probably feel scared especially with all those Black gangs around who will stab anyone.

'White extremists' encompass a diverse range of people and views, as do 'Islamist extremists'.

Blood & Honour, Aryan Nations, Combat 18, North Western Front and the Ku Klux Klan all have differing aims and objectives.

In the same way, Al-Qaeda, Tawhid & Jihad, Lashkar-e-Toiba, Jamaat-e-Islami, Deccan Muhajideen, Al-Taleban and Al-Shabab all have differing aims and objectives.

Black people started immigrating in the 1940s from the Caribbean and conflict had essentially ravaged the European continent for centuries. To be honest, since 1945, there has been much less European conflict than ever before.
 
 
 
It's completely connected to Muslims, dope. Do you know anything about this case at all?

 

Stop boring me with your nonsense.

It is just Right Wing equivalent of when the Left claim that It is all the West's fault that Muslims attacked on 9/11.

Obviously, the fact that the shooter had a connection to Neo Nazism and listed "freemasonary" as one of his interests flew over your head.

It is boring and old.

Crime rates have gone up a lot im not talking about conflicts im talking about crime rates. Youre probably a left wing sheep anyway who thinks that black people are good for white nations

I think the rate of crime is actually often disputed whether it goes up or down. Don't assume what I am. I don't think anyone is good or bad for any nation unless they've proven their worth.

Let me just put forward a stat to you in a nation I class as a white nation USA.

In 2005 and apparently the figures are around the same every year since then 37000 white women were raped by black men in comparison less than 10 black women were raped by white men, so is this good for a white nation and has nothing to do with race.

Taking that as true (and I doubt that only <10 black women got raped by white men across the entire USA in a complete year), I'd go with what you said. It does have nothing to do with race. It's not good or bad for a white nation. It is as it is. Again if that is true and we're using a 1:1 ratio (i.e. one black man raped one white woman and this happened 37, 000 times) then I would like to know what percentage that is of the entire black community in America and therefore whether it's an endemic problem (i.e. the majority, over 50%, of blacks rape women) or a minority of the community. Then you've got to look at the reasons which could take decades to figure out.

Here's two paths:

Black people commit rapes in poor communities -> Black rapists live in poor communities by and large -> Black rapists are in poor communities because of a lack of education -> Black rapists have poor education as a residual effect of slavery

Solution: Provide adequate education

Black people commit rapes because it is in their nature -> Black people suppress this in wealthy communities but are desperate in poor communities -> Black people could endemically commit rape across the country

Solution: Deport all (poor) blacks in America

And you can look at so many thousands of reasons as to why black rapists, minority or majority, commit these crimes. The reasonings I've provided are from a common, historically influenced perspective and from a less common, racially charged perspective and different people adopt different reasoning.
 
 
 
Multiculturalism has existed in India since the days of the Kama Sutra.

Incidentally, the most multireligious state in India (Kerala) is also the most progressive and has the highest levels of education provision and literacy compared to the others.

 

No. Kerala is what it is today primarily because of the socialist stand it takes.
 
 
 
Why violence and hatred? Why not just 'separation'? Most people, regardless of their political affiliations are keen to live their lives avoiding violence and hatred, though would be more than comfortable to separate themselves they did not like engaging in.

 

I think that could be the case for conservative Hinduism and orthodox Judaism, but Islaam is a proselytizing religion that actively seeks converts.
 
 
 
Muslims shoot up children= all Muslims get blamed

Crazy Right-Wing Christian shoots up Children= All Muslims get blamed.

You people are ****ing pathetic.

 

No. We are blaming the politicians who allowed multiculturalism, something enjoyed by very few.
 
 
 
Well said.

Look at what "multiculturalism" did for India. Multiculturalism is a parasite that infects a society and then slowly but surely splits it up into warring factions.

The success of multiculturalism automatically infers the failure of multiculturalism, because it is the very nature of different cultures to separate out.

Society is like a jar of oil and different cultures are like drops of water being added to that jar of oil. The left wing lunatics keep on shaking the jar, forcing a false, temporary mixture of the two, but it is, and always will be, in their nature to separate and detest one another.

 

this is possibly the dumbest analogy both f multiculturalism and india I have heard for a while. congrats
 
 
You are calling it murder already when there has been no trial? :s

You're also calling him insane - his lawyers ought to raise that as a defence then if everyone thinks he is.

I do despair at the state of justice these days sometimes - whatever happened to innocent until proven guilty?
 
 
 
You are calling it murder already when there has been no trial? :s

 

He has admitted the attacks.

That was recent. Before that there were witnesses, photo evidence, videos of the bodies, him with a gun that had ran out of bullets.. etc. No need to go all 'innocent until proven guilty' on this when it is 100% he did it, like.. there is not a single debate against it, at all.

Just to say.. the picture of the bodies and him standing there and the short video footage is.. very disturbing :/

Even when someone has committed the acts necessary for murder, their mental state can preclude it from being so in a variety of ways; things are not always as clean-cut as they look.

I wasn't aware he had confessed - that rather complicates matters.
 
 
 
No. We are blaming the politicians who allowed multiculturalism, something enjoyed by very few.

 

Forget this is the internet for a second, do you really hate living around people of different culture/race than you? Do you actually have this much hate in you or is it just a put on for the internet?
 
 
 
Lets keep this as short and to the point as possible. Ok, the Norway incident happened, it was horrific, it was illegal and murder in its most reckless form. Yet, many agree with the core ideas the suspect put forward. Point, it does not make the ideas illegal, the guy was insane but what made an intelligent man come to the conclusion that this was the only way to draw attention to the perceived problem of Muslims? I reiterate, he was insane. But, the guy had a point.

The left wing liberal pro immigration population has bullied alternate views for too long and this is discrimination too. People aren't allowed to speak anymore without fear of being branded racists, just look at the responses on TSR. "Oh you're racist, you're an idiot because you oppose multiculturalism". Well, sorry, we live in a liberal democracy and this means i will argue my points with evidence and expect others to do the same. Not for some idiot to say 'oh you're so racist, let the Muslims do whatever they want because its fair'.

I urge you to read this document from the suspect:
 http://www.kevinislaughter.com/wp-co...dependence.pdf 
Read it with an open mind, bear in mind that a lot of what he says is crazy drivel. Also bear in mind that some of what he has to say also had truth to it, and is something that people shouldn't run away from anymore.

I'd also like you to ask you 4 questions:
-Do you think it is acceptable that Muslims feel they can emigrate en masse to other countries and treat it as if they are above the law? (on a cultural and legal sense: e.g. whole sections of Swedish cities being filled with jobless immigrants/extremists. Scandanavian rape statistics. Yes, you will oppose this point i have put with the most ferocity, but there is no smoke without fire... nothing in this matter is 100% correct, nor is it 100% false. The prevalent point is that an unusually high amount of Muslims fit into these associations).
-To Non Muslims, how do you feel natives of Muslim nations would feel if you emmigrated en masse to their countries as behaved on the same level of disrespect for the society that they do?
-Do you seriously think all oppositions to Muslim immigration are crazy right wing fundamentalists? If so, do you realise your own ignorance and "generalisation"? (Yes, your favourite word).
-Have you ever questioned your own views, really?

 

You're calling it murder already when the trial has not even started, yet alone ended in a conviction?  

Murder isn't even an offence which can be committed recklessly, either...
 
 
 
Forget this is the internet for a second, do you really hate living around people of different culture/race than you? Do you actually have this much hate in you or is it just a put on for the internet?

 

It makes me feel very uneasy, and somewhat insecure, yes.

EDIT: I don't mind being round people of other races, just people of different cultures.

Yep i agree there may be mitigating circumstances (insanity, obviously). However does the insanity defence merely apply to mental illnesses and such?. It is my view that the guy clearly had a belief and had an extreme way of putting it forward. We know his beliefs and thoughts and those alone show no reason to see him as insane so i see no reason why him acting in such ways on those insane thoughts should be counted as sane?

Thinking about it, the law over there may be completely different and i cba to look it uplol

I honestly didn't think people thought this way and I'm not generalising based on you because I suspect the op will get a lot of support from a lot of tsrians, but this isn't the country I thought I grew up in.

Well, I can't really comment on the laws of insanity in Norway, but under the law of England and Wales, a person qualifies for the defence of insanity if they fulfil several criteria; the elements established by the case of M’naghten (1843), known as the M’naghten rules, are as follows; the defendant must be suffering from a defect of reason, arising from a disease of the mind, and that he did not know the nature and quality of his acts, or if he did know the nature and quality of the act, that he did not know it was wrong. Wrong, in this sense, refers to legally wrong, rather than morally wrong.

After the criminal procedure (insanity and unfitness to plead) act, those found not guilty by reason of insanity can be given discharges as dispensation, ie let off completely. They can also be given supervision orders, hospital orders and guardianship orders (probably more commonly known as orders of conservatorship).

A disease of the mind is anything that can affect the mind, really; there have been cases in which sleepwalking, diabetes, arteriosclerosis and epilepsy have been sufficient.

Yes i am aware of all that.

Which is why im trying to ask why it is reasonable to suggest he had such a defect of the mind. He was an intelligent guy with no previous relating medical conditions.His actual beliefs were normal.
His beliefs, that were the reason behind who he attacked (the labour camp) were what led him to do it, he started the attack in order to attack the people whose views and actions opposed his. It would be a longshot to suggest that he wasn't of sound mind when he had such clear beliefs and acted on them.

Sometimes a crazy white boy is just a crazy white boy without a substantive point. Accept it and move on with your life

These *issues* with multiculturalism are mostly nonsense and have been dealt with thoroughly (to the point where it has become overkill) post 9/11. Do you know how much the whole Western Europe amended its immigration policies? Do you know how much the backlash against multiculturalism has been addressed? We now legislate fear. There are substantive implications to the fear mongering, it isn't like the issue is not being addresses at the expense of liberal democratic norms and values like freedom of religion or rights to privacy.

The only people who are still tripping over multiculturalism are bat **** crazy and cannot be reasoned with. It is like trying to convince a member of Al Qaeda that different faiths should be respected-- some people would rather resort to violence. They can't deal with anything remotely resembling dialogue.

The idea that anyone would try to justify this depravity by saying that the killer "had a point" is beyond sickening.

Most Muslims want to live their lives in peace. They want to work honorable jobs, send their repressed kids to medical school, and avoid pissing off the government at all costs lest it mess up their immigration status.

The defect of reason need not be permanent or from birth, and could quite easily be brought on by something unexpected - take the diabetes example for insance - I don't feel entirely comfortable condemning a man before the full facts are out.

Honestly, so many people DO feel this way, but are afraid to say it because they think they will be branded 'racist'. There's so many people I have spoken to who feel like this, but will never admit it unless the person they are speaking to says it first, because they think they will be branded 'racist' and shunned by society.
 
 
That's right TSRians, MUSLIMS were responsible for this in some random long winded way as well. In fact I'am sure these geniuses can link us to every atrocity in the history of the universe.
 
 
 
Well, sorry, we live in a liberal democracy and this means i will argue my points.

is there anyone on this forum that SUPPORTS multiculturalism

I cant seem to find one

 

No. I personally feel uncomfortable relating it to these massacres at least so soon afterwards and before the court case has estbalished anyone, but I simply cannot support multiculturalism, for two simply things about it's nature:

- It is politically forced upon the population - ALL of the population, regardless of their race or place of birth. It is not a natural result of people living together and growing to respect each other, but rather politically motivated and, in Britain, was actively stimulated by the government raising immigration to try and bring the policy into play.

- It causes more problems than it solves. Instead of fusing together into one culture where we appreciate our differences and work together without even being conscious of our roots, it purposely forces us to remain culturally separated - it actively forces the population to accept that some groups have a right to separation and special treatment. This separation inevitably leads to distrust, hatred and violence, because that is what separation does!

This is usually where someone doesn't read or assumes I'm being racist... So 'inb4' - I'm saying that we should naturally be allowed to integrate into one society regardless of our ethnicity, instead of being forced to respect immigrants and their descendants as some separate and artificial social group - which is what multi-culturalism is or at least has been. How is this racist?!!

How on God's earth is this related to Islam. IF Muslims rape women what the hell has that got to do with Islam.Jesus Christ. Do you think any sane person of any religion will condone rape? If Islam had condoned rape then millions of Muslims would have converted to some other religion in Europe/America.
Even Nazis wouldn't like rape.
