The media has managed to work itself into a tizzy because the clothing
company J.Crew issued a press release in which it noted that Malia and Sasha
Obama were wearing clothes bearing its label and that of its children's
line, Crewcuts, when the first family arrived in Moscow on July
6.

The press release, which was sent electronically, included photos of the
Obama sisters as they walked down the steps from Air Force Onewith their
parents. Their father was making the first stop on an official trip that
would also include Italy and Ghana. Those photos are part of a historical
record. It seems fitting that history gets the details straight.

The press release, issued after inquiries about the clothes, included a
description of them and their cost   which seemed to strike some
observers as expensive. Malia's trench coat was $298. Sasha's ballet flats
were $108. No one has ever pretended that J.Crew was a bargain hunter's
store. But it is a less-expensive alternative to high-end designers, for
adults and kids alike. It's no Bonpoint, after all. And frankly, it seems
reasonble that parents with the means might want to indulge in something
extra special to wear when their children are going to be zipping around the
globe in a whirl of presidential attention with the Kremlin among the first
stops.

The hoopla began when Politico reacted to the press release like no
design house had ever stepped up and taken credit for something that a
famous person was wearing. These might be children, but fashion houses have
been quick to claim credit for everything from Suri Cruise's party dresses
to the onesies that the Octo-babies wore home from the hospital. It's always
a bit icky when children are thrust into the spotlight and often it's just
downright unseemly. But J.Crew's announcement doesn't seem out of bounds.
It's never popular to defend a company, but this time J. Crew seemed to have
acted reasonably. It did not commit a grave assault on the Obama girls'
privacy.

If photographs of its products are all over wire services, newspapers
and television   and these were -- then the company should be allowed
to step up and say, "Yes, we made that." It seems only fair.

It is not as though the photographs were taken surreptitiously with a
long lens through a school-house window. The girls were getting off Air
Force One with their parents. It was an occasion that was not only open to
the press, a cameras-and-notepads contingent had been shuttled to the
airport for the sole purpose of documenting the event. The girls'
grandmother, Marian Robinson, was also on the flight but she exited by the
rear steps and mostly avoided having her picture taken by the phalanx of
cameras. The girls could have been told to deplane with their grandmother.
That, at least, would have indicated that there was a desire for privacy. An
attempt to avoid the spotlight. But anyone walking down the front jetway
from Air Force One is pretty much saying: Look at me.

And what folks saw was a lovely family portrait. The same kind of
portrait that they saw during inauguration. Back then, J.Crew also issued a
press release describing the clothes that the girls were wearing. In
January, people found the details about their specially-made coats charming.
This was another historical moment. There's nothing wrong with asking: Who
made the coats? And the company shouldn't get a lot of grief if it decides
to fess up.
