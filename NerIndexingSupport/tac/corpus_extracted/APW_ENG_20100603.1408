A Muslim woman who was erroneously told to remove her headscarf for a driver's license photo will be allowed to retake her photo with the head covering on.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations said Thursday that a Department of Motor Vehicle employee in Oceanside insisted that the woman remove her headscarf, even though state rules allow for religious head coverings in ID photos.

DMV spokeswoman Jan Mendoza said there was a misunderstanding. She said the employee asked the woman to move her scarf, but she removed it instead.

She said DMV staff can ask customers to move head coverings so the whole face is showing.

Mendoza says the employee has apologized to the woman.
