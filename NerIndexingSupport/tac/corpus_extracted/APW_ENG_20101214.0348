The traditional season-opener for English county cricket will be held in Abu Dhabi for the second year running.

The England and Wales Cricket Board says county champion Nottinghamshire will play the Marylebone Cricket Club, which formulates the laws for the sport's governing bodies, in a four-day match at Sheikh Zayed Stadium beginning March 27.

Last season's fixture, between Durham and the MCC, was played at the same ground under floodlights using pink balls. The MCC has still to confirm the time of the match and ball color.

Lord's, England's home of cricket, usually hosts the match.

The MCC, which has no regular team, fields a side once a year for the match.
