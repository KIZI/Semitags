 
 
Should Turkey and Russia be in the EU??
 
 
Should they? Why should Russia not be considered Europe?
 
 
I'd like Russia to be in the EU so that I could visit/work there without having to worry about visas and stuff. Plus knowing Russian would be more useful because then it'd be an EU language. Just my personal opinion though  
 
 
I think Russia should and the only reason why they are not is because they have always, even up to this day, been the black sheep of Europe. Politically they have always been against the Western civilization and fought against it. Culturally, geographically and racially they are European though.

Turkey should not be in the EU because they are not European.
 
 
Turkey - no.
Russia - no (not that they'd join anyway).
 
 
NO. Enough is enough.
 
 
Not this again.

The bit on this side of the bosphorous is Europe intuitively. And what is not European? They are not all muslim and are genetically probably not much different to Greeks, Albanians etc.
 
 
Russia is problematic due to the lack of freedom of press and pro-communism resolutions passed in the Duma. Turkey is economically and culturally nonviable.

Turkey? Attaturk? Separation of chruch and state? etc etc.

They are a civilised place, you can go there, it's all cool. It aint North Africa and some people want some of them in the EU.
 
 
I'd say yes to both.
 
 
No to Turkey and No to Russia.

Well yes, they're not all Muslim. Only 98% are muslims.

Anyway, surely most of Russia is not in Europe? So why is it more acceptable for Russia to be in the EU than Turkey? Both have most of their territory outside of Europe.

I've been there and I liked it very much thank you. The people were lovely. That, however, does not improve that lowly $10k GBP (1/3 of the Greek one). The economy also has structural problems and potential for development is hence limited.

Turkey has 72 million people - how do you deal with so many emigrants into the EU? Also having such a huge voting bloc in the EU parliament is simply not going to be acceptable to most EU members. They'd have the same amount of MEPs as Germany or France yet contribute no funds to the budget.

Realistically there's no reasonable way for Turkey to contribute enough to the EU for them to get membership. The EU is not a charity. Favorable trade treaties or sth like that will do just fine.

I hate how everyone gets on their high horse when someone says no way to Turkey in the EU, because it's "unfair discrimination to muslims". It's simply not a viable member at the current level of development and education.

Genetics has nothing to do with it.

They are muslim europe is christian, Turkey is in Asia not Europe and They don't recognise cyprus as a nation or something.

Also they have a very large population and would have a lot of power in the EU.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessi...European_Union 

They are trying but I don't think they will be able to join.
 
 
I thinl the EU is more likely to lose existing members than gain new ones.

Well some of Turkey isn't in Europe, and plus the borders are ambiguous on most sides so why not there. Who says there is a definite one?
Who's to say Europe is 'christian'? I'm an athiest thankyou very much.
Protestants don't like catholics, does that mean Poland and Italy should be thrown out?

As for the poverty line someone else mentioned, with that logic(which I'm not saying is bad in itself) then the EU wouldn't have expanded beyond a small culster of the wealthiest and most advanced in weatern Europe. It did though. It's long term not just short that needs considering.

Russia is a European state with a land-empire stretching into Asia.

Turkey is an Asian state with a tiny rump of Europe.

Never to Turkey. Door should be open to Russia if it's willing to change and does change substantially. It's a door the Russians will never step through however. A more realistic question would be the Ukraine.

No, and kick Romania out as well. I'm ******* sick of the gypsies we've imported to the streets 'round our college. Unbelievably, they attack you if you don't give them money. Is that the EU ideal?

It could be argued it really should hevae just stuck to the major players and western Europe. But by what I heard, the people (Tories?) who wanted it to be a failure actively encouraged it's expansion to take on the eastern paupers and gippos so to speak.
 
 
Turkey wants to join but Europe doesn't want it.

Russia wouldn't want to join anyway.
 
 
Turkey; yes. It's unfair that they're being discriminated against just because it's an Islamic country, apparently.

I would say Russia would be too problematic...

So you're saying the intiuitve end of Europe is the bosphorous? I suppose it's a fair assessment looking at the map.

Spain and Portugal aren't in much better shape. Germany and France are soon going to get tired of paying for these countries mismanagement of their economies.

The argument really isn't about belief in God, but it's more about social values. I don't really want to go into what they are and I accept that they are diverse, but no matter how you look at it there's way more overlap between values between current EU members that there is with Turkey. Let's not forget that Turkey is the country that is hiding the armenian genocide and imprisons people for insulting turkishness or ataturk. Oh yeah, they also have an illegitimate occupation of Greece where they stole and resold greek land.

Yes but realistically eastern bloc countries had a much better potential for growth due to the educational structure of the populous. However, it's still debatable whether all new members were justifiable. They were still vastly more developed than Turkey in terms of industry and infrastructure. Turkey doesn't even have a rail link between the two biggest cities.
 
 
Russia is unlikely to choose to join. Isn't Turkey not allowed due to how it treats children in the carpet/rug making industry? Also surely the countries economies will only affect others if they are allowed to join the Euro, but you have to meet a certain standard to be able to join which is why Hungary still have the Florint.

Actually, Turkey's main problem right now is its reluctance to remove its troops from Cyprus.

Greece and Cyprus are both EU members.  

Occupying an EU member is not the best way to get into the EU.
 
 
Nah

It's not "just because they are an Islamic country" Besides that, Turkey is to Islam what Wales is to Christianity - pretty nominal relationship - it has more to do with their horrendous human rights record, refusal to recognise Cyprus, and complete economic misalignment with European targets.

Yes, true, but I doubt Turkey will ever become a member of the EU, simply based on the fact the prodominant religion in Turkey is Islam.
 
 
No.

It really is. An Islamic country will never be accepted; it's practically a fact.
 
 
No, I don't think either of them should be in the European Union.

There's no rail link between Paris and Barcelona...so?
Educational structure? There's tons of well educated muslims.
as for overlap between values, hell the catholic church believes ins ome atrocious stuff, don't get me onto the pope. That doesn't overlap with a huge amount of people with progressive values. And loads of Europe is catholic. I just don't think it's that fair on mulsims what you're saying. I know tons of immigrants from muslim countries who are completely integrated.

Perhaps that is because Europeans aren't so keen on the idea of murdering gays, denying equal rights to women, undermining freedom of religion and free speech, and et cetera.
 
 
Russia wouldn't join anyway, so what's the point of discussing it?
Turkey is in no way European. And to those of you who said that it's civilised and you can go there without any problems - yes, in the European parts. You have no idea what's it like in the southern parts.

If there was a reasonably developed progressive* Islamic country in Europe they'd already have been accepted by now together with the eastern bloc countries.

(*that might require secularism, but I'm not sure on that one.)

Islam does not ask for the killing of gays or any of this nonsense, it's not my fault if Muslims commit these crimes. It's exactly the same as if a member of your religion did x, y and z

FFS. I'm a Muslim and I know that's not why. Turkey is very secular. They banned the veil. There government hardly Islamic. The fact is there are far worse factors to consider. Stop using the "Islam" card!

People talk as if europe has always been a champion of our current values. What is a miniscule time ago relative to universal or world historical time, we were just the same way, worse about women here, and gays. (When did women get the vote here and USA? Where was/is homoexuality illegal in UK/US states(alan Turing given hormone treatment anyone?) Yes I know EU membership is a current issue but it just annoys me when people say that about Islam without seeing the broader picture and how relatively small the time is from when we were worse. It's culturally arrogant.

I like the acronym PIGS - Portugal, Ireland, Greece and Spain - they are pigs; they're greedy, they spent too much, hence they're now in too much debt!  

But I do agree with you. Greece is in a particularly dire situation, considering no one's buying their government issued bonds anymore. Surely they'd lose more than they'd gain by leaving the EU though?

Yes there is a rail link between Paris and Barcelona, it might not be direct but there's rail. In Turkey there's like one dinkey road between the two biggest cities. The two cities are dominated by low-tech low-growth industries. To say that is comparable to Europe is at best misrepresentation at worst a huge lie.

Tons of well educated muslims - that's anecdotal evidence, statistical evidence clearly shows that Turkey has less than 8% uni grads... it's a huge rural country.

I don't think this is specifically harsh on muslims. There's plenty of people all over the world from economically undeveloped countries that could never be a part of the EU from all kinds of religions - we're not a charity. Plenty of christians as well. I'm not discriminating on religion.

A tiny part of it is in Europe, the rest is in Asia Minor. If we let in Turkey, why not Morocco? They wanted to join the EU. The line has to stop somewhere.

Turkey would have the second largest population in the EU, behind Germany, and this would mean a significant amount of power would move from France, Britain, Germany everyone in fact to Turkey. This isn't neccesarily a bad thing, but considering Turkey has a lot of issues with human rights and past genocides do we really want a country like that in the EU.

Also a lot of money would be sent there seeing as it is full of poverty.

EU expansion has to stop. The door should be open to Russia because a significant amount of their land is in Europe, but Turkey on the other hand doesn't.

But as of present, Russia has no plans in joining.

Turkey though receives a resounding no from me. At least not until the human rights, freedom of speech and of expression over there are up to speed with the rest of Europe. Moreover, it would simply cause a massive wave of immigrants spreading through Europe like wildfire, if you though the Polish wave was bad enough, get ready for kebab shops on every street corner

My point is this, and the same about any issue where scales are concerned. If those Eastern European countires which were a great deal poorer than the likes of Germany, UK, Netherlands etc were allowed in, why shouldn't someone who is otherwise(even if you don't think it is, but hypothetically is for this point) in Europe, but slightly poorer again, one step poorer be allowed in? Put more concisely, if it is geographically and culturally determined to be Europe, which I believe it can be, the very fact that it is poorer than the last lot to go in is no justification for keeping it out when they themselves were allowed in being poorer than western Europe. So you have o argue it on one point or the other.

Percentage of uni grads means nothing. Our percentage of uni grads went up under Labour cos of their stupid ideas and it's been proven by employers and ll the rest to mean nothing at best, and to be counterproductive at worst. Education isn't just staistically or tritely quantifiable. You are discirimnaint gon religion by what you said before. you wouldn't keep Poland or Italy out even though tons of people in those countries may support the pope in saying condoms are evil and cause aids.

Without a stable currency countries like Portugal could never achieve the kind of foreign investment that they achieved with the Euro. Germany could then never achieve returns on such investment. Overall growth statistics show that all the members benefited from the economic zone. Without the Euro countries like Spain would have suffered from huge inflation and the whole EU would suffer from falling trade.

They're being discriminated against because there is no freedom of speech/expression and no human rights - nothing to do with Islam, because as far as I can see, Europe isn't a Christian continent, it's an Atheist continent.

The trouble is once again that you are arguing each point as part of your general case against and opposition too it, not individually. Part of it is in Europe, what are you going to do make it an independent state? If part of it is Europe it's just as European as Asian in my book, so you are left with a judgement. Northern Ireland's on Ireland geographically not the UK, are you going to suddenly decide a united Ireland is to be declared? Good luck. It wouldn't be 'sent' money, but Eastern Europe was poorer to when they came in but we're still allowed in, the fact they may have been not quite as poor is irrelevant, they were still costly and poorer but allowed in for long term. Europe is christian historically, it doesn't mean my beliefs and values are christian, that's nonsense. If you let in a load of people who are taoists to the home counties, is that going to be hugely incompatible with English values or cause a disaster? Probably not, Englishness and European identity is fluid, and all kind of differing and evolving values form it not just religious and not just christian. You might not think the difference between a protestant and catholic is significant but an awful lot of people died because of it, more than did in 7/7 or Madrid.
Once again, I don't have christian, or for example catholic values, I don't think abortion or condoms are evil, I don't think homoexuality is wrong, I don't believe in vicarous suffering, or the rebirth etc. Those are not exactly minor issues. You're making out it's all of our society, if it was I couldn't be here. Like someone mentioned, attaturk, separaration of church and state. A very significant historical reason why a country could be considered progressive. And being priogressive, a countries future potential, is waht needs to be considered for Europe, not just whether it is historically(in your example religiously) similar....like I said our history is littered with the bigotry that muslim countries suffer to some degree now, so don't make their religion inseparable from their potential socieites.

Christian values nonetheless. And I'm fairly sure that there are more christians then atheists. Maybe not practising christains though. Britain is quite secular, but eastern europe, italy and spain are very religous. Not too sure about france and germany and scandinavia.

Europe is the biggest Atheist continent in the world and there are more Atheists than any other religion.

I know, I freaked out when I found out.

This argument that because we went one step in accepting poorer countries we should continue making steps is silly. Each ascension to the EU needs to be analytically decided on and the fact of the matter is that the eastern bloc while in need of reform had relatively sound foundations for growth. They were (relatively) modern countries with reasonable educational establishments (95%+ literacy) and infrastructure. Yes they suffered from poor governance under communism, but that is rectifiable. Turkey still has a huge farming sector, very small good universities that are private (ie not good educational establishment for the masses). Infrastructure is also non-existant and the return-on-investment would be much worse.

You're proposing a slippery slope kind of argument for IR and that is silly.

EDIT: There's also a clear distinction. Eurostat analysis showed mutual benefits for current additions, but not for Turkey.

 
Percentage of uni grads means nothing. Our percentage of uni grads went up under Labour cos of their stupid ideas and it's been proven by employers and ll the rest to mean nothing at best, and to be counterproductive at worst. Education isn't just staistically or tritely quantifiable. You are discirimnaint gon religion by what you said before. you wouldn't keep Poland or Italy out even though tons of people in those countries may support the pope in saying condoms are evil and cause aids.  
 

Yes social values are one of the points against Turkey, a minor one if you ask me. If I see that as a valid argument, that does in no way invalidate other points raised. When I refer to social values I do not simply refer to religion but the fact that they will not recognize a genocide or that they legislated against free speech. That is not something either Poland or Italy did.

Education is statistically quantifiable to a certain extent. When literacy and numeracy is less than 85% like in Turkey that is an unmitigated quantifiable educational disaster. No matter what Labour is doing Britain has sound leading institutions like the Russell group. Everyone can read - that's not the case in Turkey.

No such thing.

20-30 years ago this country has become tolerant of homsexuality and womens freedom.

Begging is illegal under the Vagrancy Act of 1824. However it does not carry a jail sentence and is not well enforced in many cities [9], although since the Act applies in all public places it is enforced more frequently on public transport.

Not slippery slope. Just relativity. If a guy who was the 5"5 became the shortest ever best player in the world would you say someone who was 5"0 couldn't be? Everyone can read here? I'm not sure of that, and waht qunatifies being able to read properly. You said around 95% in eastern europe, and 85% in turkey, not sure about that, but it seems like 85% is not way less than 95%.

Google it.

According to the most recent relevant Eurostat Eurobarometer poll, in 2005, 52% of European Union citizens responded that "they believe there is a God", whereas 27% answered that "they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force" and 18% that "they do not believe there is a spirit, God, nor life force". Results were widely varied between different countries, with 95% of Maltese respondents stating that they believe in God, on the one end, and only 16% of Estonians stating the same on the other.

Er no. We're not looking at the map - we're looking at history. Turkey is a group of Turks (that's an ethnic group from central Asia) that invaded the Greek Byzantine Empire and captured its provinces. The origins of Turkey are in central Asia and they follow an Asian religion.

Russia was always a European state. Whilst the West formed great Empires on the high seas, eastern Europe simply formed massive land based empires. One of which went so far east to reach Japan - Russia. The Russian state has its origins in Viking explorers moving down the Volga river. You know, the same Vikings that founded the city of Jorvik. Or York if you prefer a more contemporary name for it.

They are trying but I don't think they will be able to join.

 

Religion shouldn't have anything to do with it. Albanians, Bosnians and many Bulgarians are also Muslims, but European, and they should also be able to join the EU. Stopping them from joining the EU because of their religion would be stupid.
 
 
Well once we get our energy issues sorted out we won't need Russia.
At the moment we are held hostage due to the pipelines coming into the EU from Russia.
However the Nabucco pipeline will sort that out to an extent,but that will run through Turkey,so part of this going through Turkey could well mean EU membership.

Do some research? If Islam is an Asian religion, what is Christianity?

Values change, doesn't mean there is not such thing as Christian values. I'm just saying there is a difference between Christianity and Islam. The fact that Turkey imprisons people for insulting Turkey or it's constitution and it still doesn't acknowledge the Armenian genocides and it doesn't recognize Cyprus as a nation are all good enough reasons to say no. Let alone the economical and geographical reasons. I cannot believe that so many countries in Europe actually support Turkey joining. 60-70% of Europeans they didn't want Turkey to join and 19% said they did. The only country who has enough balls to come out the closet and admit that they don't want Turkey in are France.

So? Spain had huge Moorish invasions and was ruled by muslims then they were kicked out and it's now known as a catholic country...its historically mulsim and not part of Europe in your logic. An Asian religion? Err what do you think Judiasm and Christianity are then? Did Christ arise one day in Basildon?
As for ethnicity, it isn't an issue, not that the are probably that much different from people that end of Europe anyway. you gonna kkick out immigrant because of not being in historical ethnic accordance?
Loads of people throw a hissy fit about a country with a lot of muslims entering the EU, but equally thow a hissy fit if you suggest less mulsims should be in Britain...perecntage wise Turkeys entry would be less 'muslim-additive' overall across europe than some countries ideas on immigration would be within that country, ie Britain
 
 
Having done quite a bit of research into whether turkey should i've yet to be convinced. There could be advantages into having such a powerful European ally in Russia when it comes to energy however just looking at a map of Europe always poses the question how big is Europe?
and then with their integration would that also lead to them adopting the Euro. its such a complex issue lead by globalisation. But my simple answer for now is it should not be considered until the global markets have become more stable and debt reduction in many of the member states starts to occur

Turkey has made massive strides politically and economically in recent years thanks to the prospect of EU membership. It's also a symbolic bridge to Asia and the Islamic world. Russia is incredibly important to Europe. Militarily, energy, economically, and for political stability. The Russians are too often demonised see the Georgian conflict. Better they are included as allies rather than excluded as rivals.

Turkey and Russia in the EU. That's funny.

There's no way continental Europe will tolerate the idea of Turkey (the Ottomans of generations gone past who fought against European empires) join them in a political union. After the mass eastern European immigration won't governments want to avoid anymore social tensions cropping up and there's always the growing vile Islamophobia that has to be considered- we don't want to arm the fascists.

Russian entry to the EU would never be tolerated by the Americans and the EU isn't going to risk jeopardizing trade links with their biggest economic partner.

Merkel made it a clear part of the election manifesto. Poland as well. Everyone is realistically against with France, Germany and Poland outright vetoing any motion for Turkey joining.

Oh come on, man do you know the tourist potential it's got....gateway between Asia, and europe, mountains, becahes etc. When you mentioned education, you were referring to literacy figures and I believe the US has some pretty bad stats on that..the cream of te cream is very clever in the US but it has a load of ignorant idiots too.

What about Morocco then, should they join? Cyprus is an island, it is not part of Asia Minor. Neither is it part of Europe. The majority of Turkey is in another continent, Asia.
 
 
Let's get the EU working properly first, and in Turkey's case a political solution to Cyprus that gets their troops out of there.

You can't develop a country of 71 million because it has a couple of beaches. The turist potential has already been exploited and the country is nowhere near developed. By your logic Africa would be the richest continent - it has the most tourist potential.

You're just harping on stereotypes against the US. Their literacy is 98%+. More than 15% in Turkey can't read at ALL, everyone in the USA can do that. Have you ever been to the USA and Turkey? 10 minutes there and you'd see it's nowhere comparable. Then go see Poland and the Czech republic and you'll see it's nowhere near comparable.

Got any figures for this officially? I'm just saying why is 5% less than us Ok, but 15% isn't, even though it's 85% percent? And Africa is arguably mostly too hot and diseased. There are also arguments about the intellect of Africans but that's another debate. I've never been to the USa but didn't really want to compare it to Turkey, wasn't my point, but on the ohter hand it's diverse. I'm sure there are some parts of the US extremely depressed relying on the more productive parts. Go to some Texan ******** on the Mexican border.

Cyprus is an island in the med. Turkey is on another continent. Slight difference.

They are being measured in different lagnauges though, may be some but no, not all, of a reason for a difference in figures. Also the EU langauge would increasingly be English in Unis etc, which makes the issue slightly different. We have loads of immigrants who are literate in English for example.

Oh ffs I didn't say it was. I was trying to make the point about ambiguities. Cyprus is betwen Greece and the coast of Syria isn't it roughly? It's Greek and Turkish cyrpiot and some of Turkey is in Europe at least so i'ts Europe in my book. It's not on the Asian mainland.

Yes but some of it isn't, and that is being overlooked. No-one thinks Northen Ireland isn't the UK cos it's on the Irish Isle geographically, which is a completely analagous case, in fact it has none of itself on the British Isle so it is geographically more Irish than British, and given history probably more Irish too.

Realistically there's no reasonable way for Turkey to contribute enough to the EU for them to get membership. The EU is not a charity. Favorable trade treaties or sth like that will do just fine.

I hate how everyone gets on their high horse when someone says no way to Turkey in the EU, because it's "unfair discrimination to muslims". It's simply not a viable member at the current level of development and education.

 

The point is they wouldn't be eligible to join until until they met the criteria. No one, not even Turls are calling for immediate accession to the EU.

Turkeys high growth rate will evenually lead to a larger more dynamic economy, there would be restrictions on Turkish emigration into the EU when it would be eligible for accession, and they wouldn't initially be part of the Schengen Agreement.

You may hate it, but an awful lot of people on here say 'no way ever'. And do point to religion and 'race', and geography (Cyprus being excluded) as primary factors in their opposition.

Figures - yeah someone posted a picture 3 posts up... I'm not making anything of this up. Literacy rates are often used to analyze the potential of a country. When it's as bad as Turkey it means lot's can't read and many more can't fill in a form properly. Business doesn't work that way.

Listen to yourself - you say Africans are intellectually inferior - that's outright clear racism and totally false. Vast parts of Africa have better weather then Turkey - I'm not talking just about the equator.

You accuse us of discriminating against Islam, yet you're a racist. This just takes the cake.

See Cyprus? Thats not near Greece.

See Turkey? About 5% is on in Europe, the rest is on Asia Minor.
 
 
Argentina has high literacy on that map but not many people would think of it as ad advanced as the European countries with the same rate or even Portugal which has the lower rate. It's not all. A load of that map in South America has the same literacy rates as Portugal but I know whether I'd rather live as many of those countries are cesspits.

Literacy represents education, not whether or not a country is a cesspit.

I haven't deleted anything that I'm aware of, it's all posted. Read my posts regarding the literacy rates in the map and you'll get my fair point. I don't say they are, thats false, I say there are arguments about it, in regards to, IQ and the wealth of nations, IQ generally. You can define that as racism but I'd disagree. They don't have better weather, they are too hot like I said, Turkey would be visitable in winter and just about not too hot in summer for many. Large parts of Africa are pretty much too hot all the time.

Requiring Turkey to meet all the criteria and I mean all is effectively saying no. Whenever there's talk about Turkey joining there's always talk about how some criteria would need to be lowered slightly.

If they join they would eventually want to be become a part of Schengen and the Euro. There's no point in letting them join and then denying them access to most of the benefits. :/

Italy is, I agree, a shambles.
 
 
OK, too many posts now and too many people who just want to beat me and not listen to my arguments, I feel I'm addressing some of you point by point and you are not. One point stands that the arguments for Ireland being in the UK are no stronger than those for Turkey being in the EU, geographically and historically.

If people can't read they can't have great jobs can they therefore lower economic potential. But it doesn't make a country a cesspit.

Well most people would rather have a country like Portugal in their political union(now and for the future)than some of those crime ridden chaotic south American places, even if they have higher or equal literacy rates. Don't be argumentative just for the sake of it son.

Yeah, but RUSSIA would be part of the EU, therefore all Russian citizens, not just ethnic Russians...

Large parts of Africa are pretty much too hot all the time.

 

My bad, it really is there. Your points about literacy are invalid, it's always measured in the native language.

Implying Africans have innately a different IQ is racist. Saying that there are arguments about it is implying that there is some truth to it, which is racist.

I was in Turkey this January (in Antalya) and it was damn cold. South Africa this time is just perfect. During the summer Croatia, Spain is about right. Turkey and Africa are just awfully hot. Realistically even if Turkey was the most awesome place for weather. No country in the world can live of just tourism and the current tourism appeal of Turkey is it's cheapness, which comes from the fact it's not developed. In case it gets developed it loses it's appeal as it becomes more expensive.

Russia doesn't want to join. For Turkey the door should be open by 2020 when its modernised to the extent of countries like Greece. For people who don't know, a Turk on average is as rich as a Russian- they have similar GDP's per capita. Also lol at the people saying most of Russia is in Europe- it's not.

OK south africas good in winter. But thats in the extreme south. But whatever, broadly speaking it's too hot. But we can debate that, it's not the issue so lets get off it. let's not nit pick. On available statistics they have a lower IQ, I don't consider a fact racist it just is a fact.

I know it's measured in the native langauge that's my point--the standard of measuring it cannot be measured to be exactly the same and the difficulty of the language is not the same. Might not be the biggest issue but they are issues. So is the fact that EU countries will increasingly be operating in English, in universities etc.

Please quote that statistic. I would really like to see that. So far all peer-reviewed articles that implied that some races are less-intelligent have been fully rebuked.

You're arguing on racist propaganda and hearsay and you're a racist yourself for believing it and propagating it.

That point about relative language difficulty is silly. My county apparently has the 2nd most difficult language in the world and we have no problems achieving 99% literacy.

I think we should rediscover the commonwealth and make it a political entity. Who would need the EU, with a globally reaching commonwealth union, Canada, Australia, NZ, even India etc.
 
 
Turkey shouldn't join:

- its not a European country.
- has human rights issues.
- denies Armenian Genocide.
- doesn't recognise Cyprus, a member of the EU, as an independent country.
- doesn't allow freedom of speech.

how do you know it's the second most difficult language in the world?

It's not silly at all, I'm not saying it's all of the reason but could be some, but anyway, we got off the main point again which is that literacy isn't as much of the picture that your suggesting.
Might be rebuked to claim intelligence differences, 'intelligence' is too complex to assess that way, most people and I would agree. But there are established links between IQ and wealth of nations and development actually, (the kind of issues you are considering as major factors in allowing EU membership) and lower IQ averages in different countries.

We and many European countries dont really have that much free press and speech as you think you know. There is plenty of manipulation of media, some claim by intelligence and government, adn suppression of dissent. America has the death penalty loads of places, I'd considert that a human rights issue, (and probably others) doesn't stop it being considered advanced. Don't say human rights issues, 'issues' is what some californian teenage girl has with her boyfriend.

I'm going to go now - let me just leave you with this:

In my experience there are plenty of wonderful people in Turkey. I've met some of the most intelligent people there, though (un)fortunately they quickly used educational opportunities outside Turkey. It was by talking to them and by seeing a couple of Turkish cities that I realized that the future of Turkey is pretty bleak. I'm sorry.

1) There's no specific punishment in Islam for homosexuality- it's considered bad and severely criticised as in Christianity- I wonder why the UK and Greece etc. are allowed into the EU because they also like Turkey have secular governments with a populace which largely follows a religion condemning homosexuality. Clerics have differing views of the punishment that should be given ranging from nutcases recommending stoning to more moderate ones recommending telling the person it's against their religion.

2) Women rights in the Quran are emphasised far more than in the Bible ir the Torah. Again why shouldn't secular Turkey be let in when Romania is.

3) Look up your history. An example: Jews were very severely persecuted by the Christians in Spain but when the Muslims invaded they took- at that time- huge step to protect the Jews in exchange for a small fee.

4) Free Speech isn't mentioned so you could say anything you want. Personally you should be able to say anything unless it has the potential to lead to a loss of life through riots and such. Life is of greater value to freedom of speech.

That's the thing with academia. I can claim that heavy metal is mysoginist because of the severely low participation of women in the genre, as I read in one journal article. Even though this reasoning means that Iron Maiden are more mysoginist than Motley Crue. Which one is the more likely to treat girls like sex objects? Ummmm.  

Using IQ in empirical studies I would personally find troublesome because it is too problematic. But having just read up on this famous book, it lacks being peer-reviewed. I think my first year group project is more methodologically sound. Perhaps I should phone up an academic publisher and get a book with my name printed on.

But loads and I mean loads of people leave and feel they have to leave depressed areas of England to come to Oxbridge or London, does that mean we don't support or try to regenerate them, do we make one part indepedent? I take your point, but see the comparison? There are advantages long term in being simply bigger.

I'm going to sleep now - one thing though, when you talked about the parts of Texas next to Mexico. You can't compare the best part of Turkey to the worst part of the USA. You can only compare the worst part of Texas to that guy that buried his daughter alive for being with a man. Anyway, this anti-american sentiment is annoying.

I come from a country with a strong anti-american sentiment and 99% of it is unfounded. To be fair America is a damn great country, even though it has a hard-on for itself. Every country has that.

Yes you can. Turkey wants to be in the EU, same way, regions of the US previously Mexican/Spanish became the USA.

Which country may I ask. I'm not being anti-American. But I don't want to join the EU with all these little ****ish countries that kiss American arse and think nothing of Britian. They can go hang.

Just like Russia really. Whilst it spans several time zones and is obviously not a black hole beyond the mountains, the parts in Asia are probably not 'significant' enough to really question where Russia belongs to. Most of the major cities are in European Russia - Moscow, St Petersburg, Kazan etc.

Georgia is in Europe but is further away than Turkey. That's geography for you. A bit like the Fareo Islands really. They are more like Britain than Denmark but are often referred to as 'Danes'.

We don't have to accept non-Europeans to a European club to try and assure some poor souls in the Saudi desert that we like them, really. I don't understand why we even need a symbolic bridge - give it 50 years and Muslims will be a plurality within many EU states.

The EU is a European club. That's why it's the EU and not say - the UN. Turkey is not historically, culturally, socially, ethnically, religiously nor linguistically European. It has no claim to be European. It's not the Ottoman Empire, it's a poor part of Asia minor with a rump of Europe (Thracia) under its control. It occupies part of an EU member state with its army. It has moved settlers into the land of an EU member state. It's a country of farmers.

If Turkey consisted of Istanbul and Thracia then there would be an argument for it. However Turkey is essentially the Anatolian highlands. This is completely different to the tourist regions dotted on the coast.

You don't judge Russia by St. Petersburg do you?

No to Turkey.

P.S. Will people stop with this sickening universalism. Saying what Europeans have in common is tolerance shows an astonishing ignorance of history. It may of been the hymn sheet for the last two decades but it is far from the truth. There was a Europe before this wave of humanist universalism swept over the continent and there will be a Europe afterwards. It is not what defines Europe or European people.

It's almost as offensive as Gordon Brown claiming a passport is an important part of being British - like the government handing out a document can suddenly magic away your ethnicity!

i don't see Russia ever wanting to join. i doubt they really consider themselves European anyway. St Petersburg is the only really "European" part of Russia.

I agree with you. But, I don't understand when peope say russia should join and not turkey. If turkey does the following things: Leave cyprus Sort out it's human rights There economy is ok. Seeing as there GDP per capita is higher than romania. Give freedom of speech/Press
 
 
Yes to Russia.
Yes to Turkey.
 
 
Yes to the world.
 
 
russia probably doesn't want to join anyway

I'd say no to turkey. The appalling human rights demonstrated by the discrimination of the Kurds to the north is one reason along with the limited positive impacts of Turkey joining the EU, mainly because of its economy.

No. Georgia aren't really Muslim as such, that's Azerbaijan, who are also in Europe. I don't think being Muslism should have anything to do with it because Bosnia will probably be in the EU by 2050 and they are substantially Muslim.

Naturally. If Turkey joins the EU, it isn't the government and its policies that will be coming to the UK, it's the people... and 99% of them are muslims.

 
The area's with a large set of "honour killings" happens in the Kurdish part.
 

Honour killings are a vanishingly small part of the concerns I have with Islam, and moderate Islam disgusts me to quite a large extent too.

Except that what muslims scholars say when they are defending Islam in accusative company is very different from what they say when they are preaching Islam to company with open ears.

And that even if the scholars were entirely consistent in that point, they also all encourage "personal interpretation of the qur'an" which will inevitably lead to millions and millions of muslims who don't agree.

We already have millions of Muslims in Britain who don't agree, and that's why there are almost 100 sharia courts operating in the UK.

You say that as if Islamic ideologies can be categorised in some kind of linear scale of which Choudary is at the most extreme end of the spectrum. That is not the case, and so using him as a benchmark is entirely irrelevant.

 
Wow. Islam has 1.6 billion followers. 10million people who disagree isn't that large.
 

If each one of those 10 million people decides to commit a terrorist attack in the name of their delusional notion that a god exists, and each attack kills 10 people, then the UK population just disappeared, and then some.

And in any case, there are only 1.5 million muslims in the UK at the moment, so if your figure of 10 million per 1.6 billion were accurate, we'd expect there to be only 10,000 muslims in the UK who want Sharia law. Clearly, that number is totally false since polls have revealed that 40% of muslims in the UK want sharia law.

 http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/ukne...law-in-UK.html 

That number would be only likely to increase if a country like Turkey had free access to the UK.

 
But the UK cannot be hypocritical. It has let the Jews have their own courts. Why can't the Muslims?
 

Neither jews, nor muslims, or in fact, ANY religious group should be allowed to live under their own law.

Greece, Spain and Portugal are seasonal economies; they rely far too much on tourism for income, which of course will only make them money for about 4 months of the year - during the summer. They just can't function at the level of Germany/France, which have booming industries that are consistent for the entire calendar year, as do we.

And of course it matters to me. You do know about Schengen: the fact that the border controls of member states have been abolished? I don't really want a border-less region from my house to Iran, thanks very much.

 

Yes...because Iran are gonna come and smack UK's ass

Are you unaware of how mass illegal immigration works? Lax border controls.

  True.

The UK is still in control of it's borders though. It's not a totally open border like it is between Schengen countries.

True, but we still manage to get illegal immigrants coming over from Calais, who live in  shanty towns  waiting to hop aboard trucks - under the watch of the French police who don't seem to be doing anything about it, too eager to get them out of France. A massive border-less region from there to Iraq/Iran would make the problem worse.

I am aware, but why focus on Iran?...are there not other countries that will have this issue as well?

Of course there are, but it just worries me slightly that the EU should border countries like Iraq, Syira and Iran - especially with Ahmedinejad in power. If Turkey became part of Europe, he'd turn against them too.
 
 
Turkey has a very strategic position with lands in both europe and asia, the reason why they dont let turkey into EU is that they are scared... they dont want another ottoman empire sparking up..

The percentage of Turkish lands actually in Europe isn't that much.

Well I am againgst Turkey joining the EU. But seriously?...If a country borders a country like Syria etc, that is not their fault so its a poor excuse to use.
Besides what will he do to Turkey?
Iran are not as big a threat as you seem to think they are..or do you just believe what the west says about them?
 
 
Aww why not? I'd say yes   Party is more fun with more people

Never to Turkey. Door should be open to Russia if it's willing to change and does change substantially. It's a door the Russians will never step through however. A more realistic question would be the Ukraine.

 

How can you say "never" to Turkey?
You dirty Russians been more of a problem to the west for years!

keep Russians out!
 
 
Turkey shouldn't join, there reasons against outweigh the reasons for.
 
 
First of all, Russia will never join EU as one of the purposes of UE existence is to gain more independence from shall we say... the superstates(Russia, China, USA). When it comes to Turkey, well... it seems as if there's not much to be gained from allowing Turkey into the EU.
 
 
turkey can shut down USA and UK troops going to iraq whenever they want..turkey will be in EU in the next 10 years you'll see
 
 
**** yeh. When The United States of Europe attacks America we have a better chance of success.
 
 
You have to look at this from a political perspective.
Look if Turkey joins EU, then EU truly becomes a superpower. (Turkey's military is badass)
However Greece won't be happy.
I don't think Russia is seriously ever going to join EU.
First EU is kind of the "West". And Russia is not exactly very friendly, and it doesn't want to be. They're slowly regaining their Soviet era sphere of influence, Ukraine for example. The election means the Orange Revolution has officialy failed.
Plus theres no way Turkey going to ally with Russia.
They're ******* scared of the russians going to invade them whatever. Thats partially why they're a major contributor for NATO. To combat the Russian sphere of influence. Plus they have that Island dispute with Greece and etc.

However if Turkey joins the EU (Russia not happy). EU becomes superpower with Turkey's manpower, military, and economy.
I think its good for EU to let Turkey join. (Then the EU will have to deal with the Russians).
Still Turkey has this article in their constitution Article 104 or something?? I forgot... that says it is a jailable offence to insult the concept of "Turkey", the wording is a bit ambigious. Puposely so. Anyway the point its incompatible with EU standards on human rights. Also they're not secular. So yeah thats also a problem.

Still it would be interesting if there were two superpowers on the globe. Maybe that push the Russians closer with the Chinese. Its like Romance of the Three Kingdoms  

But then I' just a guy procrastinating for his Biology IA so don't take what I say too seriously nor I am looking for a flame war or whatever.

If they join they would eventually want to be become a part of Schengen and the Euro. There's no point in letting them join and then denying them access to most of the benefits. :/

 

I can't say that I have ever come across such talk. If they meet the criteria whether you believe that is ever possible or not, yet without lowering it 'slightly,' would you support their accession?

Under such circumstances imo they should eventually be allowed to join Schengen and the Euro. If they choose.

Sure if they get green on all of the following:
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessi...cquis_chapters 

While it is my personal belief that they should then join (with migration quotas) I also feel that the process where each country has to approve them needs to be respected. So if someone vetoes it it's fully within their rights and I would have no problem with that.
 
 
This is NOT a debate on Israel
 
 
NO for both.

Or else the European Union might aswell be re-named to the 'European- and -Asian -and -whicheve- other-random-country-wants-to-join, Union'

It speaks to a Europe that is open and plural. And not insular looking and homogenous.

 
The EU is a European club. That's why it's the EU and not say - the UN. Turkey is not historically, culturally, socially, ethnically, religiously nor linguistically European. It has no claim to be European. It's not the Ottoman Empire, it's a poor part of Asia minor with a rump of Europe (Thracia) under its control. It occupies part of an EU member state with its army. It has moved settlers into the land of an EU member state. It's a country of farmers.
 

And a part of Turkey lies within Europe. A historic part. Turkish "culture" isn't radically different from many of it's neighbours given the influence of the Ottomans. And in a secular Europe religion ought to play no part, unless you would like to bar Albania, and section of parts of Bosnia, Bulgaria, Macdonia. I'm not even going to discuss ethnicity.

The EU member state you mention under occupation isn't even in 'Europe,' under your definition, you ignore the complexity of that dispute.

 
If Turkey consisted of Istanbul and Thracia then there would be an argument for it. However Turkey is essentially the Anatolian highlands. This is completely different to the tourist regions dotted on the coast.

You don't judge Russia by St. Petersburg do you?

No to Turkey.

P.S. Will people stop with this sickening universalism. Saying what Europeans have in common is tolerance shows an astonishing ignorance of history. It may of been the hymn sheet for the last two decades but it is far from the truth. There was a Europe before this wave of humanist universalism swept over the continent and there will be a Europe afterwards. It is not what defines Europe or European people.

It's almost as offensive as Gordon Brown claiming a passport is an important part of being British - like the government handing out a document can suddenly magic away your ethnicity!  
 

Europe is defined by conventions, rather than any strict criteria, ever since some unknown Ancient Greek pointed Right and proclaimed 'that bit is Asia' and pointed in the opposite direction and said 'that bit is Europe.' The minutiae of borders when new lands were discovered were all defined by nameless beaurocrats with perchants for defining things. That is what history teaches us. That Turkey has land mass in Europe is all it needs to be allowed to apply. Membership is something it will need to earn. We shall I'm afraid have to agree to disagree.

The Greek government is all for Turkey joining the EU  

France however...
 
 
they have troops in Cyprus.

But I do agree with you. Greece is in a particularly dire situation, considering no one's buying their government issued bonds anymore. Surely they'd lose more than they'd gain by leaving the EU though?

 

They're greedy?

Did you know that UK's debt is as high as Greece's? 12% of their GDPs. And UK is a much larger economy. If you don't believe me, do some research.

"We'll take a look at the implications of all that further down. But you might be thinking that Greece sounds a bit like a country not terribly far from here. And you'd be right. Britain is currently looking at a fiscal deficit of around 12% of GDP. That's the gap between what the government is spending, and what it's collecting in taxes. Greece's deficit, for comparison, stands at, why goodness, around 12% too."

Ukraine has a desire to join the EU, so much for a sphere of influence.
 
 
Russia has no need to be in the EU it's already just as powerful internationally. Turkey shouldn't be considered until it has cleared up it's human rights record, then there are still matters to resolve still.
 
 
well as an anarchist citizen of Turkey who'd support liberalzied socialism of many European countries. I say no, this country certainly does not deserve EU.

That is all good and well but the vacuum is being filled by authoritarian Islamists who wish to undermine the secular foundations of the Republic: basically running from the frying pan and into the fryer.

welcome to democracy...majority of this country is conservative. Not in a shariatic way, but like the "conservative christian Americans"...yeah   bad I know. But like I said it's democracy. We have to deal with it. As long as they do not limit freedoms, they have the right.

And no, they are on of the most open market parties ever....and most pro-democracy one as well. Oh and some of the most corrupt one....but thats about it really. For now at least. I prefer these guys over coup loving, status quo loving, freedom and human rights limiting, nationalism boosting army anyday.

The issue is that conservatives aren't particularly famous for their respect for minority rights. It is not such a problem in the United States because they have a great constitution and many checks/balances which ensure that no one group gets absolute dominance. In Turkey, however, such checks and balances are absent. The only check in place was the military and now that is being eroded.

Im my opinion, tyranny of the majority isn't something to be desired. I think that if the AKP were really pro-democracy, they would be a little bit more concilatory when dealing with opponents; reduce the 10% voting barrier and et cetera.

I am still unsure. I despise the AKP.

Actually AKP has the votes of minorities. From Armenian-Greeks to Kurds. In fact, they tried this thing "Kurdish expansion" in summer, which almost destroyed them because of the nationalism in the country. But they were the first party to work for minorities...
The only thing the army did was to keep status quo...and there were certain ultra-nationalist/fascist groups among them. There still are....these have to be cleaned. Army can not be strong. They are not there to keep the country's ideology. They are there to defend the country against military action of a foreign power. They must learn their place.
Sadly there are a lot of "modern" people who say(summarized: Atatürk was awesome and modern, everything he did was right, wish we have a leader like him, even if it happens with a military coup. Military is awesome anyways and they are the pride of awesome Turkish nation=FASCISM)
THe moment you say "Atatürk is bad becasue he screwed all the minorities with the nation-state policty" yoU'd be regarded as a religious freak. But hey I'm an atheist. Most people can't believe this because tahts how brainwashed they are.  

 
Im my opinion, tyranny of the majority isn't something to be desired. I think that if the AKP were really pro-democracy, they would be a little bit more concilatory when dealing with opponents; reduce the 10% voting barrier and et cetera.
 

hmmm, well you have a point here. But the barrier thing was not about AKP. And AKP would not lower it to not lose seats. This is politics after all.
AKP is not awesome, and well they are a party of the system. In fact they are way too open market. They are actually making the country poorer(I mean the BIG income differences)

 
I am still unsure. I despise the AKP.
 

I have my doubts as well...but so far, they are tolerable compared to others. And they hurt the army, they make me happy. I'm an anarchist in theory after all....the forced order of the army and their limiting of freedom makes me sick.
 
 
If Romania, Bulgaria or Greece can be a EU member Turkey can be as well. They are no more civilized or have no better economy, in some ways it could even be said Turkey is better. dont be prejudice...
