The question comes up occasionally in the
Florida Marlins clubhouse.

"Who is the one player you would take to start a team?"

Catcher John Baker doesn't hesitate.

"I've got to take Joe Mauer," Baker said of the Twins catcher
and reigning AL MVP. "He's younger than Albert (Pujols). He's a
leader. He catches. His teams consistently go to the playoffs."

And he's a very rich man.

Mauer's eight-year, $184 million deal signed on Monday is the
fourth-largest in baseball history and the biggest ever for a
catcher. Mauer, who will earn $23 million a year from 2011 to 2018,
is the only player not wearing a Yankees uniform to sign one of the
six richest contracts in history.

To put that in perspective, the Twins had a payroll of $19
million in 1999, or $4 million less than Mauer will earn each year
of his contract.

"Who would have thought a Twins player would be the
fourth-highest paid ever," Twins outfielder Jason Kubel said.

If anybody should, it's Mauer, who was born and raised in St.
Paul, Minn., and rooted for the Twins while growing up. The Twins
made him the No. 1 overall pick in 2001, after he signed a football
scholarship with Florida State.

Even if everyone doesn't agree with Baker, Mauer is still
considered by most among the top three or four best players in the
game.

Mauer is 27 (three years younger than Pujols) and is coming off
his third batting title (he batted .365 last year), second Gold
Glove and first MVP award. He's been the face of the Twins the past
five seasons (they made the playoffs twice in that time, 2004 and
'06) and probably left as much as $54 million on the table by
sticking with his hometown team.

"I still haven't wrapped my head around the whole thing but I
know I love playing here and I love being able to play in front of
my family and my friends," Mauer said.

When asked if he thought about wearing another uniform, Mauer
said: "I'd be lying if I said I wasn't curious. This is where I
want to be. And this is where I'm happy."

The teams always mentioned when discussing the highest-priced
free agents are the Yankees and Red Sox. And Mauer would have been
the highest, maybe ever, had he tested the waters. Some guess he
could have gotten $30 million a year.

And depending on what the Red Sox do with Victor Martinez, both
will be in the market for a catcher this winter, just when Mauer
would have hit the market.

That thought did not escape Tampa Bay manager Joe Maddon, who,
when asked about that exact scenario the day Mauer signed, said:
"On behalf of us, Toronto and Baltimore, we'd really like to thank
the Twins for giving him a long-term deal."

Even by getting the "hometown discount," Minnesota joins a
second tier of teams when it comes to salaries. The Twins' payroll
will jump to around $100 million this year (with Mauer making $12.5
million), which is about $35 million more than the team had in
2009.

With the team moving into a new stadium this season -- Target
Field -- and Mauer's deal kicking in next season, that number will
continue to rise.

"That tells us we are in this thing to win," Kubel said.

That will be made easier with a kid who attended Cretin-Derham
Hall High in St. Paul, where he was considered the best quarterback
in the country and an even better baseball player.

And although Mauer still wishes he had the chance to play for
Bobby Bowden, his decision was made early.

"That would have been a great route," Mauer said. "I told
coach Bowden early in the process that I love baseball -- if I have
an opportunity I'm going to play."
