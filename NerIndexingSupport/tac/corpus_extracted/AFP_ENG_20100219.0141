A Texas pilot who flew his small plane into a tax office hid his grudge against
the government from many of his friends but had begun to worry his family in the
weeks leading to the suicide mission.

Software engineer Joseph Stack was known in Austin, Texas as a typical,
easygoing guy who enjoyed playing in a honky-tonk band and didn't talk much
about politics.

"We didn't know that he had frustrations and troubles," said Pam Parker, who had
known Stack and his wife, Sheryl, for several years and last spoke to him a few
weeks ago.

"He always was very easygoing," Parker told the Austin American-Statesman. "He
was just a pleasant friendly guy."

Stack, 53, played bass in the Billy Eli Band with Parker's husband, and he and
his wife -- a pianist in the graduate music program at the University of Texas
-- would put on concerts for their friends at their sprawling home.

"You wouldn't have pegged him to do anything crazy let alone a big spectacular
crazy thing," Parker said.

Stack apparently posted a rambling suicide note on his website ranting against
the Internal Revenue Service before he set his house on fire, drove to a nearby
airport, took off in his private plane and flew it straight into the seven-story
building.

The plane crashed through the building's black glass at the second floor at 9:56
am (1556 GMT), causing a tremendous fireball.

Two bodies were recovered from the building -- believed to be the pilot and a
federal employee who was missing after the attack -- and 13 people were injured,
two of them critically.

Television stations ran shocking images of the ravaged, smoking structure that
stirred bitter memories of the 9/11 attacks.

"Violence not only is the answer, it is the only answer," said the note posted
on a website registered to Stack's software consulting company.

The screed expressed hope that the attack would cause a "knee-jerk government
reaction that results in more stupid draconian restrictions (that would make)
people wake up and begin to see the pompous political thugs and their mindless
minions for what they are."

Three federal law enforcement officers who declined to be named said there was
strong evidence that Stack had written the 3,000-word manifesto.

Jim Hemphill, a member of the band, said he was shocked by Stack's actions and
the anger revealed in the note.

"I never saw anything like this in Joe," said Hemphill.

Stack's ex-wife also expressed shock.

"He was a good man. Frustrated with the IRS, yes, but a good man," Ginger Stack
told the LA Times. "I'm in shock right now. He had good values. He really did."

His father-in-law said Stack's wife had complained to her parents of an
increasingly frightening anger in her husband in recent weeks and took her 12
-year-old daughter, Margaux, to a hotel Wednesday night to get away from him.

They returned home Thursday morning to find their house ablaze and Stack already
gone to the airport.

"This is a shock to me that he would do something like this," said Jack Cook,
who knew his son-in-law had a "hang-up" with the IRS and still doesn't believe
he wanted to kill anybody.

"But you get your anger up, you do it," Cook told The New York Times.
