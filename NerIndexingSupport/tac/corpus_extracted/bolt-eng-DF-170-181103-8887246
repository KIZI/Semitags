Naw.

Just get the criticism, correct.

I'm all for criticism. It's helps to identify defects. And once that's done, adjustments can be made to correct them.

But this damnation sort of thing isn't helpful.

 Andrew Sullivan - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 

I saw some of it on TV.

I dont much like the guy but at least he has begun to admitt he was dead wrong on many things in the past.

Which is why I put it up. I was amazed he was coming to Obama's "defense".

But it was laughable that in the vid Romney was critical of Obama's handling of the economy just when good job numbers were coming out.

Its the truth
 
 
The truth?
Dems were not in power Chris Matthews.
Repubs were and that is why the Economy was fantastic.
Listen to what he said in that video at around 7:31
"The Economy was fantastic under the Dems from 93 to 2000?
Repubs were in power from 94 to 2000
Talk about a LIE !!!!!!
 
 
No comment?
Come on lefties, you are all about truth but you refuse to accept that the left lie.
 
 
And the dems were in power when Saint Ronnie had the so called booming economy of the 80's. What's your point.

"I write this as an unabashed supporter of Obama from early 2007 on. I did so not as a liberal, but as a conservative-minded independent appalled by the Bush administrationÂ’s record of war, debt, spending, and torture."

Truth is neither party was responsible for the economy of the 90's. The PC boom was mostly responsible and that ended when Microsoft lost the lawsuit, and then we got the.com bust.

Now back to your partisan corner........
