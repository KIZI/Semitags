remember, after they destroyed the research
and development team at chrysler, gm
hired them for themselves.

stupid stupid move for the germans, great for general
motors. and of course it has hindered chrysler just
like gm wanted.

"and the pope owns 51 percent of general motors "

Patrick,

You are answering your own posts to tell us you can't remember what you were
trying to say.
And you think the Japanese are stupid.
And others.
The irony of your statements is undoubtedly missed by you.
