just looking at peoples current feel towards this group of people...so what is it? You like them or no? Do you support the movement of a free Ireland, or think that the British have a right to be there too(that sounds funny).
 
 
Of course I don't like them - I don't think any civilised and humane person possibly can support them in any way, shape or form. They were a revolting terrorist group who killed on a whim to bring about their ridiculous and thoroughly pointless ideology.

As for a "free Ireland" - places cannot be free, only individuals have that capacity for liberty. When people talk about "freeing" countries, it is usually simple collectivist double-think for oppression.

Many of the Irish have a rather immature approach to their nationality as being opposed to anything British or English. There's a residual bitterness which I simply cannot comprehend there - being from the West of Scotland, we unfortunately get landed with this sectarian overspill. This "nationalism" simply won't change in the next few decades - and will prevent any actual solution to these issues. But I am confident it will one day die out.

The IRA is the sort of movement that is, to my mind, totally unjustifiable. I really wonder why they thought their crackpot views were worth even one death, never mind the legions that they murdered.
 
 
Theres nothing wrong with wanting independance. Theres everything wrong with Terrorism. BTW I'm not a history expert but is it true that they had like major support from America (more acceptance than actual help). Then 9/11 happened and America actually realised terrrorism isn't a nice thing and so thats why the IRA is basically disbanded now. (very vague history, take with a pinch of salt)

lol! this is funny to me...because its been going on for centuries now...I don't think it could ever die out. Since the time the English first showed up in Ireland, the Irish have denied and gone against them. But yea, some of today would rather stop fighting than continue in something that may seem endless.

I believe they tried changing their ways though many try to stick with gorilla war fare...I dont believe we will be hearing from any IRA members for they take a the code of silence...its kind of like OMERTA...reason towards me asking for "belief of support" and not; "are you apart of". Wikipedia has a nice history on it though it seems to be incomplete.

As a liberal, I'd say there is.

Broadly speaking, true. The Americans, while often co-operating on certain matters with the British government (although refusing on others - for example the FBI refused to organise any sort of joint training schemes etc with the RUC before 2001) never really took the matter all that seriously. If it wasn't for the support of deep-pocketed Irish-Americans, and the blind eye turned by the US state, the IRA would've been nothing like it was.

To be fair, there was a bit of Catholic-oppressin' which probably wound them up somewhat. That is very much a relic of the past, despite what you'd think from meeting some Irish nationalists.

I really do think most people have more important things to care about in this day and age than fighting the Huns or the Taigs down the road, so hopefully it'll normalise eventually. The more cosmopolitan parts of the South seem to have adopted this position already.

Er, mate, the IRA (ie, the provisionals and the other groups that go under that banner) have a few hundred members. They're not some mass movement with agents lurking down every dark alley.

Moreover, I can't imagine any of these knuckle-dragging morons would be able to operate a computer.

cant use a computor but can somehow manage to make bombs and go largely undetected by the british and fight (to thier mind) a guerilla war against a supposed oppressor, kept the support of the local people in communities and did this for decades. Not to mention Sinn Fien running political offices.

what went a long way to destroying the IRA was the Omagh bombings. That killed 90% of support they had from nationlists. I remmeber the day that came on the news.............

the same happened when the IRA or as they were known then the IRB violently murdered T.H Burke and Frederick Cavendish in pheonix park (which charles stewart parnell was falsely accused of in the biggot forgeries scandal) killed a lot of support for them.

the oath da_nola was possibly referring to is the IRB oath of allegiance

In the presence of God, I, â€¦, do solemnly swear that I will do my utmost to establish the independence of Ireland, and that I will bear true allegiance to the Supreme Council of the Irish Republican Brotherhood and the Government of the Irish Republic and implicitly obey the constitution of the Irish Republican Brotherhood and all my superior officers and that I will preserve inviolable the secrets of the organisation

To be fair though - the debate over Irish indapendance the abolishment of the 1920's treaty by devalra gave ireland its freedom save for some people in the north. And a few extreemists in the south who were mostly old men sitting in pubs making plans that would never come to fruition. It just seems that gerry adams and ian paisley (i despise that guy) are hashing out tired arguemnts for the sake of it

For the opening question yes i would like to see a fully indepandant Ireland but at this stage it honestly wouldnt make a lot of difference in the scheme of things

Incidently L_S why is the thought of independance for a country so abhorrent to you?

Well, it's not a country, is it? It's what some people believe to be a "nation" - which is basically a term invented to suggest some bizarre fantasy difference without any actual substance.

Why does it annoy me? Because it's tribalism, like any other - and perhaps the thing which has caused more war and suffering than any other misguided idea.

Moreover, it gives carte blanche to any "nation-state" to appeal to the patriotism of their weaker-minded citizens in order to garner support for whatever they fancy doing. That's an enormous threat to individual liberty, as is the idea that government should have anything to do with these ideas of "nations" in the first place.

I have nothing against national identities or patriotism, just as I have nothing against religion but object to sectarian government. However, if we didn't have politicised nationalism, the world would be an enormously better place. It really depresses me that people are willing to murder, maim and justify virtually any attrocity in the name of something so fundamentally pointless, particularly in the modern day when our states are so tolerant.

nope cant fault it i agree completely. It is a shame that for such a tolerant and open minded spieces which we claim to be we still hold onto such tribal aspects which naturally brings division.

But then in saying that i am proud to be irish. It has a rich culture and history and is a beautiful place. Though i will admit i cast to the wayside much of its outdated ideas.
 
 
"To be fair, there was a bit of Catholic-oppressin' which probably wound them up somewhat"
Quite funny.  

Though I think your playing just how serious the I.R.A was in my opinion. It was serious enough for Strathclyde police and the M.O.D in Glasgow to believe that they were viable targets for any attack; so much so both of their headquarters were redesigned to be bomb-proof. Also, I believe that the members were actually estimated to be into the thousands.

Tactics were barbaric, ruthless and cut-throat but it can't be denied that they weren't a bunch of cowboys. Hell, it was believed they had links to Eta and Castro.

Yes, back in the heyday of the IRA, there were considered to be a few thousand members perhaps. I don't imagine the vast majority were 'operational' as such, or at least within the inner circle.

When you say Strathclyde Police - do you mean the HQ on Pitt Street? Doesn't look very bomb-proof to me. The MOD building on the other hand is a bloody fortress!
 
 
Pitt street is definitely bomb-proof. The one in the Gorbals is also bomb-proof and is also the place they detained one of the Glasgow jeep bombers.

The MOD is quite a nice piece of engineering; in the even of an attack the windows blow out and the structure collaspes into shell shape or so I'm told by my physics teacher.
 
 
Don't'cha mean Govan rather than the Gorbals?

Anyway, that is quite impressive (re: the MOD) - it's quite an anonymous place though.
 
 
The irish i come across generally seem to be very nationalist and anti-english. They seem to act as if Northern Ireland was stolen off them. I know centuries back the new english were planted there, but to go on that is stupid. When ireland was given freedom though, the government wanted to give the whole of ireland, but the unionists were kicking off. This was the attempt at keeping all sides happy. The nationalists act as if northern stolen just for a laugh to piss them off

I'm inclined to agree. The Government of Ireland Act 1920 even makes provision for later unity between the two (then) British territories of Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland. Southern Ireland never really survived, it almost immediately became the Free State.

Fact remains, the old UVF were fully armed and Edward Carson et al were more than willing to establish a provisional government in Belfast. Basically the UK Government saved Ireland from an enormously bloody war that would've sent it back into the stone age. Regardless of the problems with the border now, they'd have been far greater if there was no detached oversight from London.

in the 1920s treaty Ireland was given in effect dominion status the same as other British dominions i.e. canada (due to a very inexpierenced political team going up against some of the best politicians with Britain.) It wasnt total independance as such but pretty much in everything but name. About twenty years later eamon devalera basically abolished it and britain too busy with europe went "ok....fine.....whatver."

It was that treaty that helped lead to the civil war which in turn saw the IRA in its modern guise come about

wow who says you learn nothing in school
 
 
I'm no fan of nationalism.

And your arrogance gets in the way of judgement...since there are several sites up and running promoting not only the IRA but their believes, in general, as well.

No ofcoarse you wont see them down a black alley...they are not a bunch of thugs purse-snatching some old lady (and the Mafia isn't either if anyone might get the idea of me conecting the two...though Im really not, just expressing what I know through terms everyone can understand).

and erm...person to be fair, it wasn't "a bit" of Catholic-oppressin when a whole nation slaughters thousands and forces the remaining into slavery simply because of birth and religion. its really bloody simple why there is still hate towards the English and why it would, why it will continue until the situation is solved.

So, the reason for the hate is because of the Catholic-oppression? Agreed.

The Catholic-oppression that, perhaps, our (English people's) great-great grandparents committed? Against, what, your great-great grandparents? And that is just reason for murder? Nationalism is the most ridiculous ideology â€“ it is by chance that it was your grandparents that were oppressed and by chance it was my grandparents that were the oppressors. I hardly think that's reason for anything much at all.

It's a simple ideology, for simple minds.

The French and English were insanely hateful of each other, especially during the 100 years war. They soon resolved it though. Ireland is certainly on the road to peace.

I agree. Britain has kept its image as an oppressor. It was a large empire and has, in the last century, declined in size. As a result its quite easy to villanise such a fallen country. What people forget, of couse, is that Britain was kinder to its empire than any other country. We taught them cricket and gave them more liberty than countries such as France. We weren't concerned with control, but rather we were concerned with the economy. Those asking for apologies regarding the slave trade ought to reconsider their history. It would be a historical disgrace for people to analyse the past without any historical context. I would not, for instance, ask for an apology from the Danish or ask the countries which make up the ex-Babylonian empire to say sorry for their behaviour towards the English on our Crusades to "liberate" muslim countries. Society was different back then.

That said, most of my point is irrelevant to the discussion. Ultimately, the IRA have no justification. It's almost self-evident, for there can be no army in gaining democratic support. It defeats the idea behind democracy.

I think I have every right to be arrogant when small minded terrorist bigots are concerned.

There are a lot of Irish nationalists, yes, that does not equate to a large IRA.

You probably will actually, an good proportion of their income is made from drug dealing.

I think to find anything like 'slaughter of thousands' you'd have to go back to Cromwell - a man who most British people fought against and who is a condemned traitor. His armies slaughtered thousands here too - indeed, my university is apparently built on a pit of the victims of his army.

No, it's not at all simple except if you accept illogic as simple. To maintain any prejudice against someone for actions of hundreds of years ago (hell, my family fought on the Royalist side) is nothing short of racism. That much is plain and simple.

Causation is never that simple. There's a strong argument for the Irish problem being little about religion and more to do with land/greed.

I disagree with nationalism as an ideology (although not in the sense that I would prefer England to beat the Australians at rugby - which they did), however I don't think you make a strong argument in calling it "a simple ideology for simple minds". The motives behind nationalism are far more complex, and can be derived from pure cunning selfishness. Hitler was far from "simple" (although I suspect his history teacher may have described him as such - in fact, all except his art teachers may have described him as a difficult child). The people of Weimar Germany were far from simple people either.

Lenin was a great intellect (regardless of what you think of his ideology), yet there was certainly a nationalist element within his communist state.

All said, there are a number of definitions of nationalism floating about, including "doing what's best for your own country". That may include an isolationist foreign policy, which we saw in America until the middle of the 20th Century. Elements of nationalism are wholly rational, whilst others are less desirable.

Are you sure you're not confusing nationalism with fascism?

I was just said that for arguments sake.

In essence, nationalism is a simple ideology - a person from country X is more important than a person from country Y. I did not say causes for it were simple - though they sometimes are.

Very extreme nationalism does become fascism, but no (despite the extreme nationalism of the IRA), I'm not confusing the two.

Yet this is something the British empire was notorious for doing around the world, weither directly or indirectly by arming loyalist mobs to the teeth under the name of national security in the 1920s. So how can you be against politicised nationalism but seem to be quite in favour of an empire by one country when in the end they done the same thing; kill.

In the 1960s the IRA was within an inner struggle, the Provisionals where established through defence committees when it became clear the IRA of its day wasnt prepared to defend nationalist areas from being burnt or over-ran with B Specials. At its peak, after internment without trial its membership was easily in the few thousands on active service and thousands more offering to use their houses as safe houses or relay information to the leadership (just as its true the UDA had roughly 50,000 members in its peak).

No we dont, nationalists are not anti-english, they are anti-british army/government at the least. Most nationalists will have plenty of family and friends in England, support English football teams, and travel to England. In my opinion Northern Ireland was kept from becoming part of the republic to appease a small minority of people, it just so happened the British government was fine with keeping the majority of Irelands industry aswell which was situated in Belfast isnt it? The British government wanted to give Home rule and it was passed in Parliament but held back by the House of Lords. Its not just a laugh, 3000 people dead during the troubles is not just a laugh.

The first dÃ¡il of the irish republic (pre free state) was an all ireland parliament, 4 out of 6 counties in northern ireland had a nationalist majority but where ignored, in practicality, only antrim and down had loyalist majorities but it was ignored.

As far as I am concerned the Provisional IRA had every justification for its creation, when the British army was sent here to become peace makers they ruined themselves by backing up a secterian police force during the falls road curfew and interned hundreds of men not even connected with the IRA, while loyalists had the armies "permission" to create their own armed roadblocks, those guns where by no means legal either.

What happened later, certain bombings, where wrong, but it does not defeat the justification of the IRAs existance in a country that created the conditions for their renewal. If the unionist government done things right, the Provos wouldnt exist, if the British army done things right, the Provos wouldnt have had support, and even with the state existing, if it was in a fair context with every man having a proper un-gerrymandered vote, and families given fair treatment to the right of housing and jobs, the Provisional IRA would not have split from the Dublin leadership that had hung up its guns years before in favour of a political strategy.

That is the reality of Northern Ireland. UVF men like Gusty Spence, David Ervinem, Billy Hutchinson and Billy Giles did not wake up one morning, have their breakfast, and decide to join the UVF, the conditions where there for it to be justified. IRA men like Martin McGuinness, Gerry Adams, Gerry Kelly and many many ex-hunger strikers did not wake up one morning, wash their face and decide to join the IRA for a laugh, the conditions where there for it to happen. Ironically, it was these men and many others in the prisons that talked and discussed comprimises like the Good friday agreement and where there in their suits at Stormont during negotiations with Tony blair and Mo Mowlam into the small hours, while people like Bertie ahern where involved in dodgy financial dealings and years earlier John Major could barely hold a parliamentry majority.

If you want to read about the IRA and the British and Irish security forces read a book by Martin Dillon called The Dirty War. I'm about half way through it and I have to say it is the best book on the troubles I've ever read (and I've read a fair few of them republican and loyalist alike). It kicks the arse of any James bond story and the author went to great lengths to get as much factual information as possible. It deals with the split in the IRA in the 60s, IRA gun-running, Irish government scandal, British army stupidity and criticism from within its own ranks, the British governments reluctance to send the British army in hoping the Irish government would invade Derry and Armagh first, more gun-running, IRA UVF talks, IRA and British talks, IRA and its dealings with Qadaffi, the PLO and German arms dealers. Its an amazing book although it only goes up to 1991.

Actually Libby and a few other Irish topic regulars should read it too.

That said, no - of course not. I could never support any army. I'm a pacifist. However there is an enormous difference between the British Army and a terrorist group.

 
your attitude was the same attitude taken 300 years ago mate
 

I sincerely doubt it.

 
republicanism hasnt died yet, politically its stronger, with a stronger leadership than its ever been in the past 100 years.
 

Ah, but only because it became moderate. Sinn Fein is now effectively part of the establishment in a state it apparently doesn't want to exist.

 
Yet this is something the British empire was notorious for doing around the world
 

Now this is where accusations of racism actually touch at the truth. Nationalists always end up coming out with statements like this.

No, it was not 'notorious' for anything of the sort, save by bigots. Just like the Germans should not be considered 'notorious' for gassing people. Every state in the world has done objectionable things - the British state no more than any other.

 
So how can you be against politicised nationalism but seem to be quite in favour of an empire by one country when in the end they done the same thing; kill.
 

Killing in the name of peace, law and order - even if it is misdirected - is the best sort of killing.

 
The first dÃ¡il of the irish republic (pre free state) was an all ireland parliament
 

No it wasn't. It had no standing in law and was simply a meeting of Sinn Fein MPs with pretended authority. Simple treason.
 
 
No, your completely right! The reason for the British army to exist is not to kill people, nor was their reason for deployment to Northern Ireland in the first place! That didnt go to plan though did it, it evolved into something else. The reason for the Provisionals to exist was not to kill people either, it was for the protection of catholic areas in Belfast and Derry, evolving from defence committees set up when the Official IRA ran away and couldnt handle it.

Your attitude was the same taken 300 years ago, that Republicanism would burn itself out. There was no real armed resistance between before and after united Irishmen, and the Easter rising. Nor has it become moderate, the demands are still the same as they where in 1922, a 32 county irish republic. Because Sinn Fein have taken their seats in Stormont does not mean their views have been moderated, it means they are being realisitc in achieving that goal. Using the state does not mean support for the state, or else every nationalist that pays their taxes apparently supports the state, it would mean I apparently support the state because I pay taxes and support Sinn Feins position, I dont, I accept it as existing for the moment.

So, you tell me how the British empire was not notorious? What actually gave the right to the British empire to invade other countries and what gives the right of those "rebels" to fight back? Every state in the world has done objectable things, how many of those have had an empire that stretches the globe? Honestly like, your kicking up about Irish nationalists then defend the British empire which is inheritantly nationalist in itself as in reality, Britain is a nation, Britain exists as a national identidy.

I'm sure the people of the Bogside, Ballymurphy, Andersonstown, Lenadoon, Crossmaglen, New lodge and Short strand would entertain the idea that murders by the British army where in the name of peace, law and order. Are you ****ing serious?

The first dÃ¡il had as much legitimacy as Westminster over Ireland. Treason my arse.

I'm afraid I don't buy that. If they'd wanted to 'protect' communities, then they wouldn't have gone around bombing and antagonising British interests, but would've sought a non-violent solution to any such problems.

Either way, it seems to me that admittedly heavy handed police responses were a consequence of violent nationalism rather than vice versa.

 
Your attitude was the same taken 300 years ago, that Republicanism would burn itself out.
 

Oh right. Sorry, thought you meant something else there.

While you're probably right in the above, I do believe that something has genuinely changed in the nature of the Western world. I believe that, in absence of any sort of Roman Catholic oppression, it's quite possible that it will die out.

 
So, you tell me how the British empire was not notorious? What actually gave the right to the British empire to invade other countries
 

What gives any state the right to rule? If you ask me, it's an unanswerable question, and the only measure of a state is how it rules.

 
Every state in the world has done objectable things, how many of those have had an empire that stretches the globe?
 

So it's the size of a country that measures its morality?

 
Honestly like, your kicking up about Irish nationalists then defend the British empire which is inheritantly nationalist in itself as in reality, Britain is a nation, Britain exists as a national identidy.
 

Yes, Britain is a nation. But the "British" of the British Empire was a quite separate political label which only originated with that nation. The native peoples in India, or Rhodesia, or Hong Kong were not part of the British nation - they were only British in this other, political, sense.

 
I'm sure the people of the Bogside, Ballymurphy, Andersonstown, Lenadoon, Crossmaglen, New lodge and Short strand would entertain the idea that murders by the British army where in the name of peace, law and order. Are you ****ing serious?
 

Why do you think they did it? Do you think Scottish and English soldiers really cared about religious rivalries or the like? Maybe they just liked killing people?

No, they were attempting to destroy a terrorist group which was attacking Northern Ireland and Great Britain.

 
The first dÃ¡il had as much legitimacy as Westminster over Ireland. Treason my arse.
 

Funny - a one-party assembly which never held elections, was never granted any lawful authority, could not exercise its authority, is not held to have had authority by any presently existing states...

...and then a normal Parliament?

I know what I'd side with.
 
 
Well you may buy it because its pretty much the truth, up to you if you want to believe it or not.

Firstly, the first bombs to go off in Northern Ireland where by the UVF, which if I'm correct was a power plant or a resovoir (I forget what one), which was blamed by the Stormont government on the IRA, the point of the explosion. The Provisionals didnt exist at this time, and the Provisionals didnt start bombing untill the 1970s. 1969 saw the rise of the Provisionals as the Belfast leadership walked out of an IRA Army council meeting and turned their backs on the Dublin HQ who where looking for non-violent solutions. I mean, for **** sake, before the split when the IRA did try to protect catholic areas they ended up running away, there was graffiti and chants for months of "IRA I Ran Away". This was all before the Provisionals formed.

Heavy handed police responses where not a consequence of violent nationalism, heavy handed police responses had been happening for years and even against the civil rights association where off-duty B Specials ambushed and battered marchers under a bridge on the outskirts of Derry, so what are you talking about there?

I've no particular interest in the roman catholic church and I dont like it either, Republicanism has had on and off relationships with the catholic church, there have been a few instances where the church ex-communicated IRA members when it wasnt in the churches interests, so the church will not lead to the downfall of Republicanism.

Yes, and how did the British imposed Stormont government rule? It guaranteed a unionist majority in Government for 50 years, it was as good as a one party state that looked out for not even the working class protestants but for themselves, in modern times that would be called a farse of a democracy with no legitimacy, so do you really blame people for going against it? Not everyone out against Stormont was in the IRA, or violent.

You know fine rightly that when I say "British people" I mean the people of Great Britain, not Hong kong.

Did you know that ex-British army soldiers where involved in training the UVF? They taught them how to fire a gun, they taught them explosive training, they taught them tactics because they sympathised with the loyalist cause (proof of this in the book Loyalists by Peter Taylor) so yes, there were quite a few English or Scottish soldiers that cared about the conflict, they where in the middle of it. Now you might say, because they are "ex" soldiers, that its not the responsability of the Government to do anything about it, but I'd say different, that as citizens of Britain that are trained to kill, they have a responsability to not do what they done. I do have sympathy for young lads my age that didnt give a ****e about the troubles, they didnt have a choice weither to come here or not, but in atrocities happened all over Belfast and Derry, weither they cared or not is irrelevant. Not to mention the British army where working off intelligence from the RUC dated in the 1950s. Can you picture that today? So why is it acceptable?

The dÃ¡il was set up by Sinn FÃ©in from westminster elections, it hasnt been the first rebel parliament to spring up in the world and in the end, it stayed, I'd call it legitimate. It done a pretty good job at undermining Westminster rule, too, it just depends what part of the country you look at.

Its clear who you would side with, you are not a Republican and have never grown up in an environment like 1920s Ireland or 1980s Ireland. You've never met volunteers, I have, they arent ravaging monsters what can't wait for their next kill like some people would believe. Many are well educated and well-read in politics and ended up becoming peace makers with loyalists investing their time into cross community projects.

I hardly think that's reason for anything much at all.

It's a simple ideology, for simple minds.

 

its more than what happened then, its also what happens now as many peoples of the English still do hate the Irish...I see it many times. though maybe not all react to the Irish the same way, anti-Catholicism still exists through out northern region of Ireland of protestant rule and amongst the English. Along with the constant hate towards the Irish in general. Now not all react this way of coarse. And not all Irish hate the English. Its the matter of continuation, not just past occurances. And in no way is Nationalism rediculous since, in part, thats what brought modern UK together.

So like I said, if your grandparents raped and mutulated mine, of coarse I would hate and see your family as a disgusting group of pigs. Of coarse resentment would exist. If your generation thousnads of years ago did that; how could I have any sense of anger? simply by the constant antagonizing from your people.

That said, most of my point is irrelevant to the discussion. Ultimately, the IRA have no justification. It's almost self-evident, for there can be no army in gaining democratic support. It defeats the idea behind democracy.
 

hmm.... why numbers have fallen correct?

There are a lot of Irish nationalists, yes, that does not equate to a large IRA.

You probably will actually, an good proportion of their income is made from drug dealing.

I think to find anything like 'slaughter of thousands' you'd have to go back to Cromwell - a man who most British people fought against and who is a condemned traitor. His armies slaughtered thousands here too - indeed, my university is apparently built on a pit of the victims of his army.

No, it's not at all simple except if you accept illogic as simple. To maintain any prejudice against someone for actions of hundreds of years ago (hell, my family fought on the Royalist side) is nothing short of racism. That much is plain and simple.

 

  nicely put...
too bad they really dont get into drug dealing, but actually venture more in gambling and other means of business. Iv never read anything leading to drug dealing, though there have been articles of people being killed by IRA and are known drug dealers.
 
 
Numbers have dropped because of three reasons. One, Republicans asked themselves "can we keep this up?", second, Republicans asked themselves "can we keep up support?", both answers came to a "no", it had went on too long, the political climate changed. Representatives of the British government, Irish government, the British army, the IRA, the RUC, the UVF and UDA had been meeting in private for years.

The third reason is splits with dissidents, again. Those involved in the drug trade with loyalists would be doing so if they joined the IRA or not, the IRA has actively worked with the police for years to combat drug dealing because its a view they share, for once.

Did anyone say you did? I should hope you don't anyway. As for "mucking up" anything - that was the UK, including Ireland, not England. Personally however, I blame the state of Africa on the Africans. After all, look at Zimbabwe under British rule and then now.

I actually disagree with that entirely. I think colonising India, for example, was a positively lovely action. After all, we were introducing civilisation to the uncivilised. Most of these independent countries build on very British foundations.
 
 
Africa seem to do just fine with being 'uncivilised'. The problem was governing the countries with a Western style government, then giving them independence and letting them run their own countries with without experiance or guidance how to. I really don't think we should get into an arguement however.

Now or in the past?

Because I don't consider living til 30 (if you're lucky), constant warring, isolation from any external philosophy or academia and problems with drought and famine to be particularly 'fine'.

Perhaps indeed. However it also strikes me that it wasn't simply innocent wandering into such issues - plenty of the post-independence leaders in Africa knew fine well that they were screwing their country over.

 
I really don't think we should get into an arguement however.
 

You're in a forum called "Debate and Discussion" - you either throw it open to argument or you do not say it.

.

 

what about Irish totaltarians?
 
 
The unionist movement (note: not particularly monarchists) in the south is quite small with no political party or representation at any level, maybe Fine Gael would sympathise with them but ultimately they are also an irish republican party, just in a different way.
 
 
Theres several political parties within Ireland:
communist party of Ireland
socialist party of Ireland (about the same to me)
Workers Party (look for peace and accept Good Friday Agreement)
progressive democrats
progressive unionists
green party
the republican party (Fianna Fail)
Sinn Fein

all with different ideas about different subjects
 
 
I dont get your point?

communist party of Ireland - had some following back in the day, not anymore, they are republicans.
socialist party of Ireland - republicans
Workers Party - the sticks i.e OIRA, republicans.
progressive democrats - thatcherites, but republicans all the same.
progressive unionists - the PUP are linked with the UVF.
the republican party (Fianna Fail) - right of center republicans but have their left leanings as well.
Sinn Fein - left of center republicans.
there is also Fine Gael, the opposition party who are republicans right of center, irish labour who are left of center and closely linked with the SDLP up north, and a few others.

they all have different ideas on different subjects but they all have something in common (with exception with the PUP but i'll address that in a minute) in that they accept and promote the republican system of government. The PUP have been involved with cross community politics with republicans for years and david ervine himself (who died recently) was never off southern television trying to press his point, in my opinion they are the future of unionism and have with sinn fein been advokating what is going on now for years, but for now the DUP have spotlight. the UVF (who some members are prominent in the PUP, I named them earlier) where in talks with the IRA years ago about an amalagated provincial Ireland under the ideas of rurari o'bradaighs "eire nua" (new ireland), independant from Britain with northern ireland having autonomy, and they are quite willing sometimes to take the idea of the Ulster nation over the British nation, as complicated as it sounds.

I think you're using a very basic reasoning, i.e. that "colonising" is bad.

Anyways, look back at what I said:

"What people forget, of course, is that Britain was kinder to its empire than any other country. We taught them cricket and gave them more liberty than countries such as France."

I'm comparing Britain to the likes of France. Whether Britain's colonising was kind in itself or not is entirely irrelevant. Though surely you can see some of the positive elements we introduced to their "primitive" (excuse my generalising) society.
 
 
India was civilised long before us...they had cities and sewerage systems when we were all still probably living in caves.

So the only secterians in Scotland are the universally immature (about their religion and nationality) Irish. You are categorically saying that it is all their fault it continues to this day and nothing to do with the UVF and DUP and the other half of the old firm?

See, this doesn't really fit with my situation as an Irish catholic from Glasgow, with a protestant mother, who in turn has catholic grandparents.

And to go back to opposing independence on liberal grounds, why? Other than not believing in the idea of a state in the first place (which still doesn't really make sense for me since you would still be free of the UK, just not to form the ROI), how can this be used as a basis for opposing Irish independence?

I don't really see what this has to do with Scotland, although admittedly we get some spillage over here.

Because quite simply one cannot be a liberal and a Nationalist. One is individualist, the other is collectivist. I'd argue the latter is an absolute affront to liberty.

just showing difference parties all with personal ideas within ireland
 
 
I strongly disagree with what they did but I understand why. Don't worry, the international community identifies with Irish Republicans. Does't Bobby Sands have a street named after him in Iran? Gerry Adams used to get invites to the White House. You can take a republican stance and be a pretty reasonable, non-violent person, believe it or not.
 
 
No they renamed the street to something else after a few years, although the death of Bobby sands created protests around the world and rightfully so.

Why rightfully so?
 
 
Because he deserved to be treated as political prisoner, he was in jail for political reasons, and he died before the Government gave into the hunger strikers demands for status as political prisoners.

The courts where handing out prison sentences of 18 years or more for things like possesion of a gun or suspected membership of the IRA, while convicted paedophiles and rapists where getting 2 to 6 years and early time out. Like them or hate them IRA volunteers where in a war situation and the british army was out in full force against them.

so true...

and its wrong in my mine that so many people just claim names or words that have been assotiated with good things, and then turn it around to make it seem like the original gorup-original word-was bad to start off with. Though there might have been a few cases where actions may have seen as wrong, its important to keep one image. (thats a more personal insight...Im just tired of seeing all these groups claiming rightousness by taking a name of another group and all these words or signals being turned into a signal of terrorism or evil...so its a little bit of just ranting)
 
 
Make no mistake the IRA done some wrong things, I'm not one of those people that will support a donkey if its on a republican ticket, when the IRA planted bombs in what it called economic targets, they where wrong, when the IRA planted bombs in civilian areas, they where wrong. It doesnt mean they are the only ones at fault. Often the security forces ignored warnings because it would further their propaganda, as its been shown in released documents over the years, especially in dealings with the British armies MRF unit that would dress up in paramilitary clothes and use siezed paramilitary guns to shoot people and then blame it on the UVF and IRA.

There are a lot of things that wenton that will never be shown in a newspaper or on the TV.

Firstly, there's a line to be drawn somewhere, being imprisoned without trial for holding opposing (even extreme) political views is one thing, being imprisoned after trial for a criminal offence is another. What's next fathers for justice demanding that their idiots be treated as prisoners of war? Second, why does being a 'political' prisoner entitle someone to wear their own clothes and have free association with other prisoners?

 
Like them or hate them IRA volunteers where in a war situation and the british army was out in full force against them.
 

I know a number of people who served in the province in various roles. It appears that you forget to mention that the IRA and other groups targeted the British Military in significant force. It's also well known within the military that if the Army had been allowed to use 'full force' then then most of the groups involved would have been made significantly smaller.
 
 
Yes, and while it is a criminal offence to hold guns in the UK, the British Army had no problems in giving permission to loyalists to man their own search barricades with guns that where hardly legal.

Why doesn't it entitle them? The point of being a political prisoner is that you arent an ODC ("ordinary decent criminal" was the term used by prison guards), you are not there for criminal reasons you are there for political reasons, because the national situation has forced you to make a decision.

I dont condemn the British army for hitting against known, documented, and proven IRA men right then and there, it was war, and no Republican will say otherwise either if they have a bit of sense, likewise I dont condemn the IRA targetting British army.

I shudder at what "full force" is, they already interned hundreds of innocent men and beat "confessions" out of them, colluded with loyalists to target human rights lawyers and prominent civil rights activists, not to mention their dodgy dealings in the MRF. Could it get worse? If you ever lived in my neck of the woods you'll know if full force was the option it would have made the IRA even bigger, and trouble would still be going on today.
 
 
Your point may be strengthened, if you put your points in context - time, political state, what the other sides were doing at the time.

While the British Military was far from perfect, particularly in the 70s, it needs to be looked at with the background of what else was happening.
 
 
I could go into all sorts of detail but no one is going to read it, but I'll do it for my previous post and any others that you want me to back up.

At the time when the British army gave loyalists permission to man their barricades with guns, the Provisionals had evolved into an accepted force, they had members and they had guns and most importantly they had support. The British army had ran through the falls road interning hundreds of men and looking for guns while the IRA had been tipped off and got out of the area, taking most of the guns with them. It was probably the worst period of the troubles infact. This obviously lead even more young people to join the PIRA once they got out of the interrogation centers.

The MRF was a unit in the British army, it ran an undercover laundry service where two undercover soldiers would pick up peoples washing around West Belfast and test the clothes for forensic investigations, building profiles on people. Meanwhile in the van there where at all times two soldiers documenting what people where doing at the time in a secret compartment in the roof of the van. The IRA executed the driver (and most likely) the two british soldiers in the hidden roof in Twinbrook, when they discovered what was going on from a double agent working for both the IRA and MRF.

At the same time the MRF where also involved in sparking a secterian war between the UVF and IRA, most likely to make things easier on the regular Army soldiers. Selected MRF "operatives" where given paramilitary balaklavas and seized guns. One particular incident was when they shot at an unarmed community vigilante patrolling the area of Riverdale just off the Andersonstown road, 10 minutes from where I live, then sped away in the direction of a local loyalist area. Eyewitness's saw the men approach a military check point, provide ID of some sort and drive through, obviously no one was meant to see that. The political state was Stormont still having power, but by no means control of the area, and there where very high tensions with ordinary nationalists between two minds on doing something about the system (in their view obviously) and joining the IRA in a fight against a historically foreign army and a 98% protestant secterian police force, or do nothing and try and get on with their lives.

Some direct family members of mine was involved in passing messages between the UDA under Andy Tyrie and the IRA army council (but never members of the IRA) during the 1980s after the hunger strikes had taken place when both organisations realised it couldnt go on forever.
 
 
You only have to look at the severe injustices of Northern Ireland's past to understand the IRA. The British and the Unionist government wanted the IRA back in the sixties, they wanted to remove focus from agitating civil rights which were more difficult to deal with.

At the end of the day, the IRA did not succeed in gaining Irish independence. At the same time, the British government was unable to defeat the IRA, otherwise there would have been no peace process.

Well citing two examples, one of whom was definitely an active member of a terrorist group, and one who many people cite as a probable former member of a terrorist group, is hardly demonstrating reasonable, non-violent conduct.

I doubt Iran gave a toss about Bobby Sands. The street name was changed simply to piss off the British.

As for being entertained at the White House - well, that's of course something which has been extended to all Northern Irish party leaders as part of the peace process.

It just annoys me to see this group of terrorists being tarred with the same brush as the men and women of the 1920s who were defending their republic and fighting for their independence.

 

They were a terrorist group back then too - plain and simple. Under international law, they had no basis for their demands against the UK, nor were they legitimate combatants - ergo, resorting to violence is simply criminality.

If I decided to go all socialisty and then stole some gin from a shop - would I be deserving of this label? Of course not. Bobby Sands simply wanted to piss off the government in any way he could - no two ways about it. Also, he wasn't in jail for political reasons, he was in jail because there was a serious emergency and it was believed with good cause that Sands may well engage in violent acts if released.

If he had taken the line that, as an interned person rather than a convicted person, he should be entitled to certain greater freedoms within the prison system, I'd happily have listened to that. But he was not - he was arguing for better treatment for terrorists. He's just lucky we didn't have the inclination to build our own Camp X-ray on Cyprus for his kind.

Oh dear lord. For one, courts do not hand out sentences for 'suspected' anything - if you were proven beyond reasonable doubt to be a member of the IRA, then you'd be sentenced. As it happens, the laws on membership of banned organisations have very rarely been enforced - for political reasons as well as the inherent difficulty in prosecuting such cases.

Paedophiles and rapists don't go around mass murdering, typically, however.

Turning a blind eye to something does not equate to providing permission for it. The former is an accepted method of law enforcement when there are wider problems to deal with.
 
 
Ah but thats it Libby, going "all socialisty" wouldnt make you a political prisoner because your sat on your arse in scotland, you've never had to deal with the british army busting into your home at 4 in the morning shouting and breaking as much as they can in search of guns (IF they even find any which in most cases they didnt), then lifting every man over the age of 16 and throwing them into a land rover to be interrogated and threatened with jail. The political climate in scotland didnt need armed vigilanties to protect communities from being burnt out like at bombay street. If all that happened to you, what would you do? Fob it off the way you do now? Hardly.

Bobby sands was in jail for being a member of the IRA, he didnt wake up one morning and decide to join them for a laugh, he and others joined it from lack of option in their political environment. You dont want to accept that, your ignorant of what the British government and army was like over here, maybe you dont even want to know.

Your opinion is typical, its completely ignorant of the situation with no knowledge on the matter.

The Black and Tans were a police force. A heavy-handed one, admittedly. Either way, I don't see what that has to do with my point on the legitimacy of combat and waging war.

Aye, thats why the British army stood across the street from them in clear view of what you would call illegal guns in the united kingdom. Turning a blind eye indeed.

How does it not have a point on your point on combat and waging war. When the Auxillary drove into Croke park during a GAA game and opened fire onto the crowd killing 20 something people, was that in the name of king and country or was it terrorism by a state force?

And the PSNI are continuing that practice of "turning a blind eye" according to this news report in the Belfast Telegraph:

 
"Community representatives have condemned the PSNI for failing to intervene during a sectarian attack on two Catholic men in Portadown,County Armagh. The men had to be treated in hospital for facial injuries after being set upon by up to 30 people at Woodhouse Street in the town early on Sunday. A spokesman for the Garvaghy Road Residents Association said security camera footage of the incident has been sent to the Police Ombudsman Nuala O'Loan's office. The spokesman said PSNI members watched the attack take place and waited until the ambulance had arrived before intervening."
 

I wonder if any non-indigenous groups on the 'mainland' can identify with such "blindness" on the part of those purporting to be protecting us from harm?

The vast majority of the international community doesn't give a toss about Ireland. And yes, the international community is mostly pro-British because we're a relatively decent nation with plenty of friends.

Moreover, Ireland was not part of the British Empire in recent times. Admittedly it was colonised to a certain degree as a result of Poyning's Law and perhaps before, but in 1801 it ceased to have any sort of colonial relationship with the UK and became a full and equal part thereof.

Exactly. I'm not denying a blind eye was turned. Equally, I've seen the police ignore young people drinking in my local park. As I've said, it's an understandable method of law enforcement.

While it is abuse of authority, it was not organised in the manner that would be associated with terrorism any more than a policeman who gives you a solid kick in the ribs when he arrests you is a terrorist.

Unlike the IRA, the Black and Tans were a legitimate organisation. This was an illegitimate and disturbing action. Therein lies the difference.
 
 
I think armed loyalists who where committing most of the violence and bombs at that period are a bigger threat than the police ignoring youths drinking in parks up in scotland. The Army should have been in the same way they where after the IRA (dirty tricks or not) if they where really there for stablising the situation. It clearly wasnt the case, weither you like it or not.

It wasnt recognised that way by the British government because it was the feckin British army that done it. I couldnt give a ****e if the IRA where illegal or not they wherent there to hold up British law they where there to fight an abusive occupation. If your idea of a the Black and tans is of a security force that abused authority but isnt disturbing in the least, then you honestly havent got a clue about the situation.
 
 
The Loyalists may have been committing more violence (I don't have stats to hand, but I'll assume it is true) is not essentially the fact in dispute when trying to maintain the peace. IRA bombing was indiscriminate and caused a great deal more harm to the state, the economy and the wider people than Loyalist violence - which was mostly focused in their own areas or against the IRA. Admittedly there were occasions when they simply targeted Catholic/Nationalist individuals indiscriminately, but generally they were simply a criminal force which is fine so long as they keep within themselves.

Anyway, I need not refer to British law - only to international law, which would bind the IRA even if they were a real army - they were not occupied, they had no right to act on behalf of the Irish people and had no right to behave in that way even if they claimed it was in some varient of "self-defence".

As for the Black and Tans and being "disturbing" - you've actually quoted me as saying the exact opposite of what was replied. I'll overlook it as an error for now.

The international community do not support Britain in Ireland. What are you smoking when you type? The international community will be on the side of the sixties Catholic working class family, painted in the same light as the IRA, with their door smashed in by the British army at night calling their kids fenian so-and-so's. The community that endured a few hundred years as second class, native citizens, violently oppressed. The damage the British and British Loyalists have done to Ireland, and the tripe you come out with.

A large chunk of the planet is happy to be independent of the British, relating to Ireland having been colonised and oppressed as a nation themselves. Thankfully, the sun has set for the Empire in those parts of the world, soon the whole island of Ireland will follow and this whole nasty chapter can be over.

Pretty shamefully biased. "Loyalist murder = ok, because I don't like Irish Republicanism". Loyalist terrorists managed to kill very few IRA members, but many hundreds of innocent Catholics. But nevermind - they were OK. Tell the family members its OK because the Loyalist death squads were discriminate in their killings and they were only a "criminal force" that apparently "kept within themselves" (?). They were fine to act on behalf of Protestant Loyalists.

I doubt Iran gave a toss about Bobby Sands. The street name was changed simply to piss off the British.

As for being entertained at the White House - well, that's of course something which has been extended to all Northern Irish party leaders as part of the peace process.

 

Bobby Sands wouldn't have been displeased. I assumed they did give a toss as they renamed a street for him. Didn't the Black Panthers have links with the IRA? Didn't John Lennon write a song "Give Ireland back to the Irish". People outside of Ireland have given their support to the Irish cause many times. Do a bit of research, enlighten yourself

IRA bombings at that time where on military and police barracks, they didnt bomb economic targets untill later. Loyalists on the other hand had a policy of shooting any and all catholics as they saw them as IRA protectors. The double standard in your post is shocking.

The IRA had a right to exist, they had a right to exist when Sinn Fein won a complete landside in the British general election on an independance ticket in 1919, and they had a right to defend catholic homes from loyalist mobs in 1969 when called apon by those people. As far as I'm concerned Britain never had a right to step foot on Ireland or occupy any bit of it, and never will.

So what exactly was your point on the Black and Tans?

Warrington? Economic?

You seem to have an interesting grasp of the laws on private militias, explosives, firearms, etc.

 CAIN  identify more victims of the IRA than any other organisation involved in the troubles, not only that, but of the 1,800 victims of the IRA, less than 200 were identified as terrorists (around half of which were IRA men killed in own goals).
 
 
Warrington took place in 1993, 20 to 25 years after the time period we're talking about here.

I've said it already, British law on the IRA is irrelevant when they see that law as illegitimate. The political situation couldnt have gotten any lower before the Provisionals formed, law doesnt mean much when you have a state out against a certain set of people, when those people legally cant vote, where certain people had five votes while others had none, are discriminated against in housing legally, jobs legally, and especially when they made up almost half of the population! You can see why nationalists held contempt for British law. Also that particular line you quoted me on was in reference to the IRA of 1919-1922 where they did have a right to fight against an abusive occupation, not the Provisional IRA of 1969. It took the British government nearly 20 years to outlaw the UDA, an armed militia with 50,000 members at its height. Untill sometime in the 1990s it was legal to be a member of that paramilitary organisation.

Again, CAIN shows those figures on a whole, the entire period of the troubles, i've been discussing foremost the formation of the IRA and the few years that followed, particularly 1968/9 - 1973, at that point it was loyalists who where doing the bombings then blaming it on the IRA for propaganda reasons, it was loyalists that where involved in death squads and collaborating with the B specials, many of which where members of both the UVF/UDA and the Police.

If we're going to talk about legitimacy and terrorism, then  http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/organ/morgan.htm  will give a good briefing on the Military Reaction Foce, the 9th listing. British army using "terrorist" tactics to carry out murders.

Yes, chiefly deluded Americans who imagined Ireland as a magical land of fairies and pots of gold at the end of rainbows.

As for the Black Panthers, I have no idea - I certainly wouldn't put it past the IRA to support a Communist ethno-nationalist and militantly racist group.

And no, John Lennon did not write "Give Ireland Back to the Irish" - I'd expect anyone with even the slightest interest in the Beatles and their subsequent acts to know that it was the first Wings single and as such written by Paul McCartney. Like the aforementioned rose-tinted Americans, both John Lennon and Paul McCartney were of Irish extraction anyway.

Which of course signifies that everything they say is meaningless? You're of British extraction I expect, do you believe that you are incapable of making reasonable, valid statements about Britain? Wouldn't you put it past the IRA? Apparently, the Panthers held meetings about the situation in Ireland and supported the armed struggle of the IRA. Not everyone is wearing tinted glasses about Ireland, as you seem to think. You were right about that Paul McCartney song though. This is the one I meant

"Sunday Bloody Sunday

John Lennon & Yoko Ono
Album: Some Time in New York City

Well it was Sunday bloody Sunday
When they shot the people there
The cries of thirteen martyrs
Filled the Free Derry air
Is there any one amongst you
Dare to blame it on the kids?
Not a soldier boy was bleeding
When they nailed the coffin lids!

Sunday bloody Sunday
Bloody Sunday's the day!

You claim to be majority
Well you know that it's a lie
You're really a minority
On this sweet emerald isle
When Stormont bans our marches
They've got a lot to learn
Internment is no answer
It's those mothers' turn to burn!

Sunday bloody Sunday
Bloody Sunday's the day!

You anglo pigs and scotties
Sent to colonize the North
You wave your bloody Union Jack
And you know what it's worth!
How dare you hold to ransom
A people proud and free
Keep Ireland for the Irish
Put the English back to sea!

Sunday bloody Sunday
Bloody Sunday's the day!

Well, it's always bloody Sunday
In the concentration camps
Keep Falls Road free forever
From the bloody English hands
Repatriate to Britain
All of you who call it home
Leave Ireland to the Irish
Not for London or for Rome!

Sunday bloody Sunday
Bloody Sunday's the day!"

End quote.

Well, actually justices who interpret the law, but nevermind. Terrorist groups are illegal, the IRA were defined as a terrorist group in all the countries in which they operated (TTBOMK), ergo, they are illegal and had no right to exist.
 
 
And likewise myself and other republicans think British law has no right to exist in any part of Ireland. That in my opinion gave the IRA a right to exist.

Works both ways, that legitimacy lark.

Well, no. British law does exist, your wishes and desires don't count for much (except at the referendum which you, err, lost).
 
 
And the IRA did exist, it was a reality, so weither its illegal by a foreign government is irrelevant to me.

What referendum did we lose?

Even if you really twist it round so that you can believe that Irish law applies in Ulster then the IRA is still a terrorist group.

 
What referendum did we lose?
 

The Border Poll 1973. Quite decisive really.
 
 
Who said anything about Irish law? The Irish government where buying guns for the IRA in the 1970s.

Are you serious? The border poll was boycotted because it guaranteed a unionist majority, it wasnt polled at all in the south and the majority of the island was in favour of a united Ireland. You cant just put it to one part of the island to make a decision when you know it was set up with having a unionist majority in mind. Not conclusive or decisive in any way shape or form.

The entire island voted vastly in favour of Sinn Fein in the last Irish westminster election on a complete independance ticket, it was ignored by the British government of the day. In 1998 it the Good friday agreement was put to the entire island, 70something% said yes in the north, close to 98% in the south said yes, it settled the national question for the future and in my opinion is a road to a united Ireland. That is decisive.

And the reason there would have been a unionist majority is what now Jim? It's not by any chance because the majority of people in Ulster are British, want to be British is it Jim?

For the record, if the referendum was extended to the republic, it should be extended to the rest of the UK.
 
 
The reason there would have been a majority of unionists is because the boundary commission in 1925 set it up (to great controversey) to guarantee a unionist majority where it matters. Northern Ireland was localised, so by that same logic, we can keep localising and localising, Derry, Fermanagh, Tyrone and Armagh should have been on the other side of the border.

There is no vast majority Renal, you should know that if your going to debate on Northern Ireland. Its roughly 40/60 with the nationalist community predicted to "outbreed" the unionist community within 20 to 30 years. The people of Ulster sounds more like an Ian Paisley speech, this notion that everyone in Ulster is British, its a lie.

You know fine rightly it would get a no vote regardless of an all ireland majority if it was to extend to the UK this making it irrelevant, it can only be between the republic and the north, or dont have it at all. The good friday agreement has made it clear, in the event of a nationalist majority (and it will happen), there will be a united Ireland. There is nothing the British government can do to weasel out of it either like they've done before, the majority of the island wont be ignored again.

Not to allow the majority of unionists to remain British and the majority of nationalists to become Irish?

Why should anyone in Westminster give a **** what the RoI think? We don't routinely consult any other country on our internal politics. It's up to the people of Ulster, if they want to be British, they stay British, if they don't, they don't.
 
 
Eh? Not to allow the majorityof unionists to remain British and the majority of nationalists to become Irish? Irishness in NI untill the trouble was heavily frowned apon they even had laws banning the tricolour from flying and had Paisley march up the falls with thugs to remove one in Gerry fitts office.

Do you actually know much about NI? They should give a **** what the republic thinks because it gave the republic that input on NI, infact it was Thatcher herself that brought the republic into the talks. The British government consulted the Irish government on a number of occasions when dealing with NI and was even prepared to let the Irish army invade Derry and south Armagh (i.e the Irish army invade "UK soil") to relieve the fighting before the British army could be sent in.

I am from Ulster, I was born in Ulster, I grew up in Ulster, its not as simple as wanting to be british or not, thats all been sorted in the GFA and overwhelmingly approved by both sections of the community in a referendum with a high turnout. Its up to the people of the entire island, not just 6 counties of Ulster.

No ****, is that where you got your level-headedness and clear perspective?

Why do you recognise the Belfast Agreement? It's signed by a government you don't recognise?
 
 
Dont be sarky. Everything I've said can be backed up with facts if neccessary, everything, it doesnt mean I'm not going to put it in with my own opinions and interpretations of those facts. I've actually saw what the British army and the IRA done.

I recognise all the Governments in a sense they exist and they are there, I'm not a republican like Rurari o Bradaigh who digs his head in the sand whenever he hears something he doesnt like, I'm realisitc in what I believe. There is no alternative to the GFA, nothing, nothing at all, and anyone out against the GFA are yet to put forward a sensible alternative even after 9 years.

Looking over your posts, I'm not convinced.
 
 
What are you not convinced about exactly?
 
 
That you recognise the government in NI.

Given that you don't believe that it's laws apply to you because you don't believe in it's legitimacy, but you'll believe that it's alright when it signs agreements in your favour?
 
 
I never said that. I said I dont believe in the legitimacy of the old Stormont regime back when nationalists wherent allowed to vote. It wasnt legitimate at all. Things have changed a lot.

I voted for a party on the idea that they would be taking their seats as a governmental party. This government has representation from both communities equally which is essential to a divided society.

We all think its alright when agreements are made in our favour. You've never grown up in a community that was loathed by the state, the GFA guaranteed the rights of the irish people within NI to fair treatment in jobs, housing, a meaningful vote, and accountable policing, and with that the reason for the Provisionals to exist disappeared into electoral politics. dont forget the reason why the provisionals existed in the first place, it was never to unite Ireland, that was only part of the bigger picture. They formed to protect areas from B specials and RUC allowing loyalist mobs to burn the place to the ground.

What isnt convincing to you there? How can i put it any clearer?

They were pretty **** at it then, keep the police away from Catholic areas by staging riots and storing bombs in, err, catholic areas...

 
I voted for a party on the idea that they would be taking their seats as a governmental party.
 

Are that party allowed into the HoC yet?
 
 
Do you actually know anything about NI? Honestly like. You should know the 'ra done a very good job at keeping the police out or it wouldnt be such an issue 20 years later, "no go zones". They kept the majority guns and bombs in middle class nuetral areas.

They've always been allowed to enter the Commons, they chose not too and it doesnt particularly bother me either way, I'm more concerned about what they do in the Dail and in Stormont.

And so we get into those special occasions; where both sides meet. Hero or Villian? Terrorist/rebelion group or freedom fighter? I see seperation of a group of people that one proclaims death to a seperated race and Religion as another simply desires a seperation from a controled government. But true that these two do share trates and sometimes combine. Its particularly easy in this seperation, and even the combination of such two groups when it is seen in a way that would find pleasable to the person taking a look into such organizations. Of coarse the loyalist is opressor and of coarse the freedom fighter is a patriot stuck possable with terrorism, but why not let live a seperation? As you have one side to simply murder and praise murder for a personal selfish cause, and another to kill in the sense of mind...helping others that feel a similar cause.

Thanks for the link, Jim-ie. I've bookmarked it to watch the lot whenever I get the chance.

Who made the series of programmes, btw?
 
 
I have no clue but it interviews people such as Glen Barr of the UPRG (political thingy of the UDA), Michael Farrell who went on to lead Peoples Democracy as well as eye witness accounts of things in the 1920s and 50s, 60s, so on.

Not one sided at all, it gives a fair look at things.

After a lot of 'digging' I found out that "The Troubles" was a documentary series originally televised on BBC in 1981 and repeated in 1988. It was produced by a Ruth Caleb who was head of documentaries at that time.

I know self praise is not praise, but I think I deserve a little accolade for my researching skills.
