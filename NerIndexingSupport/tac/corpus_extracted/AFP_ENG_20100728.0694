Jack Tatum, a former all-star safety with the Oakland Raiders known for his
crushing hits on opponents, died Tuesday of a heart attack. He was 61.

Tatum had battled diabetes and other health problems for years, the family said.

Tatum will always be connected to one of the game's most tragic moments. His
bone-crunching hit on Darryl Stingley in a 1978 pre-season game left the New
England Patriot player paralyzed from the neck down.

Tatum's book which was published in 1980 was titled, "They Call Me Assassin".

The former first round pick by the Raiders in 1971 played US college football
for Ohio State.

In nine seasons with Oakland, he started 106 of 120 games, had 30 interceptions
and helped the Raiders win the 1976 National Football League championship. He
played his final season with the Houston Oilers in 1980.
