The European Commission voiced full support for efforts to reunify Cyprus,
commission vice president Gunter Verheugen said on Monday.

Verheugen is on a two-day visit to the eastern Mediterranean island.

He was received by Cyprus' President and Greek Cypriot leader Demetris
Christofias, who briefed him on the peace talks with the Turkish Cypriot side.

"I only told him that the European Commission fully supports his endeavours and
fully trusts him that he will do everything he can to find a solution,"
Verheugen said.

He described the partition of Cyprus as a "really outdated problem," adding
"this problem is a problem of the 20th century, it has no place in the 21st
century."

He urged the two sides to find a solution, which is in the interests of the
people living on the island, whether they are Greek or Turkish Cypriots.

Verheugen was the Enlargement Commissioner of the European Union in 2004, when
the late president and Greek Cypriot leader Tassos Papadopoulos made a teary-
eyed televised speech on the eve of a referendum, asking voters to reject the
Annan plan, a blueprint initiated by then U.N. chief Kofi Annan to reunify the
island divided since 1974.

Verheugen, a strong proponent of Cyprusâ€™accession to the EU, told the European
Parliament that he felt "cheated" by the hardline Papadopoulos administration.

For several decades, the UN and EU have continuously worked to persuade the two
communities to find a viable solution to the Cyprus issue.

The current European Commissioner for Enlargement Olli Rehn urged Greek and
Turkish Cypriots in February to grasp the "unique chance" to reunite divided
Cyprus this year and speak in one single voice in the European family.
