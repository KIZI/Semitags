Sawks, Twins, and Phillies will win 100+ games.  
 
 
Our offense isn't going to be what it was in years past. I don't see 100 wins. I see around the same as usual, low 90's.
 
 
They're going to beat up the Mets and Nats real bad this year. That's where they'll get those seven extra wins from. Take that straight to the bank, son.
 
 
Nats always play us tough though.

Zimmerman kills us (unless he hasn't killed the chuck knoblauch syndrome this year   )

As a Pirates fan, I've finally given up on caring about baseball. I grew up loving and playing the game, but between the ineptitude of the team's management and the general state of the economics of the game, it's just not as interesting anymore. Basically, they may as well make it about a 14-team league and turn the rest into their minor league systems.
 
 
How the fuck did I miss this thread?!

Less than a half hour til the season starts!
 
 
 
PLAAAAAYYYY BAAALLLLLL!!
 
 
I'm still a lil pissed at Truthspeaker for not starting the 2011 thread.

Oh well, if things go right I will be fighting wit Xotoxi over the rights to start the thread next year.
 
 
Unfortunately baseball is quickly losing its popularity especially as the older generations die off. It is too slow and maybe too intellectual for todays kids. Children particpipation is declining rapidly. They now play soccer for some reason. I like baseball but the sport will gradually sink into obscurity in the next 20 or 30 years unless some drastic changes are made.
 
 
We have action on my fantasy team, people!

Brian McCann with a base hit and an RBI.

Holy fuck it's been a long winter!
 
 
 Giants' Barry Zito Involved In Auto Accident - Baseball Nation 

 
Tuesday morning, San Francisco Giants left-hander Barry Zito was involved in a two-car accident not far from his Los Angeles-area home. Henry Schulman (via SFGate):
Lt. Ana Brackpool, a watch commander, told The Chronicle that Zito was taken to Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles with unknown injuries. A person who alerted The Chronicle to the accident said it was his understanding Zito was not seriously injured, though he was assisted out of his car by fire personnel. A source said he left the hospital and went home shortly after.

Yanks beat the Braves in 6 for the championship.

You read my mind. I grew up a Pirates fan. Clemente, Stargell, Manny Sanguillen all the way through Dave Parker to Bobby Bonilla.

Small market teams have been crushed since 1994. To hell with baseball and the way that crappy business is run.

Steelers training camp is supposed to open in July, but the lockout....
 
 
No, the Pirates have been crushed.

The Rockies, Twins, Marlins, Diamonbacks and Rays have all had their moments.

Meanwhile, the Cubs, Mets, Orioles and Dodgers really haven't done too much of anything, despite their big market status.

Getting swept by Texas was understandable. They were playing away from home against a very good offensive team, and they just came out of the gate rusty. But Cleveland is a terrible team. The Sox will get their shit together, so I think it's just surprising but not concerning.

Annnnnnnnnnnnd Granderson just annihilated that pitch.

Yup Brad Lidge is out til the break so it's a typical year thus far.

But seriously your rotation makes mine look like store brand creamed corn. Well except for Lester, who isn't as good as Halladay now but is the best guy to have over the next 5-8 years out of both staffs, IMO.

With the run support we're getting minus Utley and what we got out of Werth, and the sub 3 ERA of our Big 4 (I think it's still sub 3, i haven't checked in a few days) I don't think we need Lidge all that much. Plus Contreras isn't the worst replacement in the world.

But yeah Halladay will be past his prime while Lester is peaking.
 
 
I can't believe that Josh Beckett struck out 10 Yankees in 8 two-hit shutout innings last night. Yes, the Josh Beckett on the Red Sox.
 
 
Guy was a beast last night. 14 straight I think?

Really that's what the Sox are supposed to look like. Everything was clicking. Only criticism is I think Beckett should have been allowed to go for the CG.
 
 
 
 If Dice-K Continues To Struggle, Red Sox Could Call On Old Friend Pedro Martinez - Over the Monster 

While many fans such as myself have refrained from pushing the big red panic button, I couldn't resist pushing the smaller one that said "Dice-K Is Done" after Monday's performance. While I'm more skeptical than anyone on his trade value or Theo's ability to just cut ties with him, something needs to happen.

The only problem in the instance is that the Red Sox just don't have a guy that could fill that spot in the rotation.

One could argue that a guy like Alfredo Aceves, who has a great track record as a pitcher could be converted into a starter, as the Red Sox have attempted to do over the past month. I propose a better option that hardly anyone is talking about : former Red Sox pitcher and three-time Cy Young Award winner Pedro Martinez.

In a recent interview, Martinez  told the New York Times  that he is preparing to make yet another comeback after taking last year off. Pedro reiterated that it would take him about a month to get in game shape if a team came calling. In that interview, Martinez was asked which teams he would prefer to return to the league with:
"Id probably have to say the Red Sox. I would like to win a World Series in the National League, so the Phillies are in there, too. But for the time Im going to be playing, I think Boston is more suitable so that I can retire with the Boston Red Sox and go to the Hall of Fame with the same hat."

 

 
 
 
Indians are 12-4!!! I was hoping they'd have an OK season, but I never expected them to start off so hot.

Here's hoping they sweep the Royals...
 
 
How about them Red Sux?
 
 
 
How about them Red Sux?

 

Hmmm...

Well after an 0-6 start thankfully the Yankees came into town and the Sox immediately found their winning ways taking two of three from them including a game in which a once thought dead Josh Beckett thoroughly owned their asses. They are above.500 since that series started and riding a three game winning streak.....this with Gonzalez and Crawford struggling during that stretch.

Fuggin' Dice-K went seven innings of one-hit, one-walk ball last night.

Things are fine and getting better.

You were saying?

As a braves fan born in california (don't ask me I don't know) I was pretty happy with our pummeling of the giants and padres this week. God help us if we can ever stay on par with the phillies fab four though. Our lineup could be really dangerous if uggla heats up and chipper stays hot,,,,,

I find myself wondering what would have happened if brooks conrad didn't play in the series against the giants last year. COMON 8 Errors! Holy shit, can't believe he is still on the team.

With the win, the Red Sox moved back into sole possession of first place in the American League East, taking a one-game lead over their rivals.

Boston can thank its success against the Bronx Bombers as a pivotal reason for being in first place. The Sox are 7-1 against the Yankees on the season and have taken the last six, five of which have come on Bronx turf.

"If you don't play well, they're going to beat you," Jeter said. "They've outplayed us every time we've played them so far. They have a good team, that's the bottom line. They can hit, they can pitch, they do a little bit of everything. If you don't play well, they're going to beat you, and that's been the case the last couple times."

Oh yeah, there was a baseball game last night too...  

 
Terry Francona may not be much of a hockey fan, but he is a realist. And so, a few hours before the Red Sox [team stats] faced the Tampa Bay Rays last night, the manager asked what even he knew was a rhetorical question.

Think anybody will be watching our game? he said.

Lets just say DVRs across New England likely were set to the Red Sox telecast, in which case they captured a nearly historical gem from Josh Beckett [stats].

While Bruins goalie Tim Thomas was blanking the Vancouver Canucks in Game 7 of the Stanley Cup finals, Beckett one-hit the Rays, retiring the final 19 batters in a 3-0 shutout at Tropicana Field.

Sorry I'm late everybody... This list is obviously made by a walking dodger dog who dreamt that the dodgers would be anything but sorry this year. As a Giants fan, this is the only Dodger jersey I would wear.  
You really think the Giants... who got better... would finish 3rd in the NL West? How many cups of seawater do you drink a day?
 
 
 
As a Pirates fan, I've finally given up on caring about baseball.

This euphoria in Pittsburg just may tide you over for the next 18 years of missing the playoffs. I truly wish better for Los Piratas.

Give your kid a break... Brooks is a solid player who had a bad moment. Blame the rest of your offense for not being interested in scoring a run against our pitching last year. You all might have won 1 more game... maybe. but last year nothing scored against Los Gigantes.
 
 
Cainer gets the win... Pablo has a 21 game hit streak.
 
 
 
 
 
So I was really looking forward to seeing what having Ellsbury and Crawford on the corners was like but they weren't there long enough...

 

Who saw Crawford being such a stiff? Why do guys always suck eggs right after they sign a big contract?

 

 

Don't let Zito traumatize you. Crawford will straighten things out.

Don't get me wrong, I don't think Crawford's shelf life matches his contract and we'll end up choking on that deal in the end. Carl will likely be run out of town as well.

The annoying thing in the now is that no matter what the lineup will always be some kind of an issue so long as he an Ellsbury are in it together.

Ahem. I have gone from a vigorous, vibrant happy young man to a middle aged curmudgeon watching my beloved Pittsburgh Pirates auger into the basement of the National League. I saw games in Forbes Field, in Three Rivers Stadium and in PNC Park. and have suffered unbelievable anguish as the team of my youth became a national joke.

And now today at the All-Star Break in 2011 my beloved Pittsburgh Pirates are not only four games over.500, but ONE game behind the division leaders the St. Louis Cardinals and the Milwaukee Brewers. Today at the All-Star Break, I can crow about THREE Pittsburgh Pirates going to the All-Star Game.

There's crow and humble pie being served in clubhouses all around the National League today courtesy of the winning Pittsburgh Pirates, arguably the feel-good story of the summer.

I don't know why anybody wouldn't like Jeter. Class act all the way. His mom and dad did something remarkably well in raising that kid.

I was AT Yankee Stadium on Saturday. A Father's Day gift that morphed into a SPECTACULAR present for the entire Liability clan.

The only thing better would have been hitting for the cycle (improbable given that he needed the triple to complete it, but on that day anything was possible).

oh, and ending the 1st half in First place AHEAD of the hideous Botox would also have been an improvement.

But still, not a bad way to send out the 1st half of the 2011 season.

After 18 straight losing seasons, I would hope there's a way to play better than.500 ball just once.

That Park is sensational though. I shouldn't be too hard to get players to want to play/stay there. Second only in beauty to the Giants home and a very close second at that.

And now today at the All-Star Break in 2011 my beloved Pittsburgh Pirates are not only four games over.500, but ONE game behind the division leaders the St. Louis Cardinals and the Milwaukee Brewers. Today at the All-Star Break, I can crow about THREE Pittsburgh Pirates going to the All-Star Game.

There's crow and humble pie being served in clubhouses all around the National League today courtesy of the winning Pittsburgh Pirates, arguably the feel-good story of the summer.

 

Yeah no kidding. And the Twins were going to win over 100 games this year too.

Sorry I'm late everybody... This list is obviously made by a walking dodger dog who dreamt that the dodgers would be anything but sorry this year. As a Giants fan, this is the only Dodger jersey I would wear.  
You really think the Giants... who got better... would finish 3rd in the NL West? How many cups of seawater do you drink a day?

 

When I saw Posey's leg get torn up... I enjoyed it. And yes, McCourt is a major douche, we all know this.

ahh cmon man you can't be happy about somebody getting hurt unless he's a douchebag... Posey's a great kid.. I wouldn't wish physical harm on any dodgers, I just hope they lose every game.

Then it begins... Down with Philly Again! Because the harsh reality for all the other contenders is they will all fall to the Giants or the Phillies and it will be an NLCS rematch. We still got the pitching plus now you can add Vogelsong and his league leading era to the mix. So there definitely IS a way... We're used to succeeding with an anemic offense... This phillies are not used to playing low scoring one run games. And that's exactly what they'll have to do to beat the Giants.
I like our chances again.

Tell those hitters to eat their cheese steak sandwiches if they wanna hit any homers off our staff. Bullpen is as good as the starters too.
 
 
I hope we can touch this kid the Phillies got on the bump tonight. We can't touch anybody but we're good at 1 run games.
get ready for the whistles to blow louder than ever tonight in Cheesteak Stadium tonight

Well, you guys were lickin yer chops to see ol 75 out there throwing batting practice. Timmy had the flu and will go either tonight or tomorrow. Hey when we lose we look bad... But we'll scratch out these next two like we always do. This is all part of the plan. Gotya right where we want ya.
 
 
Pedroia almost hits the cycle.

Pedroia extended his hitting streak to 23 games with a triple in the first inning. He later added a double and two singles along with a walk. He scored three times and drove in another.

Gotta love this pip squeak in clean up.
 
 
Worst call in Major League History as the Pirates are robbed and stripsearched last night and we all were robbed of a legitimate conclusion to last night's 19 inning marathon between the Braves and Pirates...
I want Replay and Replay Yesterday!!! The whole 9 yards all the way... right down to computerized balls and strikes.

even as a braves fan that was a dispicable way of ending an amaxzing game.

hey... not our fault Bruce Bochy used your pitchers in the all star game to help avoid them this turn... smart managing I say. We can thank them later for helping us get home field if we get to the WS again...
like I said, we had you where we want you... 2 outta three wins rings.

and btw... I'll take a hundred Kendricks instead of ol Zeets.. Can't wait till Jonathan Sanchez comes back... Then 75 will finally get bumped from the rotation.

I don't know man, there's been a few days off since the AS game where Manuel could shuffle the rotation around. I highly doubt anything Bochy did affected this series, but I could be wrong. I've been way too busy to follow the day to day moves this season so I'm not sure how Manuel's been handling the rotation in that regard. I do know there was one Lee start a week or so ago where he was on 6 days rest, so obviously something changed somewhere.

of course, but hey, we've dealt with everybody on your roster last year and beat them, including and especially Lee who had a better offense behind him last year than this year's and last year's Phillies.

The one thing that's positive about our offense is they don't know who is pitching to them, whether it's Roy Halladay or Joe Nobody... We scratch out 3-4 runs and beat that pitcher or when we lose we get shutout and lose by 5 or more runs. It's just our M.O. Win the close ones and forget about the blowouts....
Gotta love that ridiculous team era of 3.06... The starters have been awesome but the bullpen has been even better.... 0.56 era since the all star break

We don't have any Joe Nobodys in our rotation. Oswalt is back on Sunday, and that makes Vance Worley our #5. He's only 7-1 with a 2.33 ERA.

Cain and Linc aren't at their best this season and you guys will be lucky to make the playoffs. You got Arizona right on your ass and have to race Atl if you want the WC. You guys really aren't that good this season and I'm just being brutally honest.

1-0 so far for the series  
 
 
Hi.

My team hits good pitching and has two legit top of the rotation guys in Lester and Beckett.

Well Lincecum has definitely been better this year than last year and Cain as well, however the problem has been the run support. Don't go looking at Wins and Loss Record.. Both have lower era's and higher strikeout totals with lower walks than last year. It's been all about run support. The Offense is back to the level it was in 08 which was simply dreadful. Last year we were at least slightly below average but with all the injuries this year the offense has been abysmal... That could change with our new acquisitions but this year more than ever it's about our pitching... and don't worry about the D-Bags. They were always pretenders and will fade. Don't buy their fools gold. We'll have no problem winning the west and then all we gotta do is limp in to the playoffs and we have a shot because we have the best staff in the majors. That is why we still have a chance. We just need the offense to get hot for a couple weeks and the west race is over. Trust me, Arizona is far more flawed than us and they will fold by mid september if not earlier.

I truly hope we face either the Yanks or the Sawx in the Series. It would be epic, and then you can say you hit good pitching or not.

I'm not sure how you can say you have the best pitching staff.

Here's the current team pitching numbers as of today:

1. Phi: 72-29, 3.09 ERA, 33/36 saves, 896 hits, 366 total runs, 347 earned runs, 78 hr, 272 walks, 861 K,.238 opponent avg, 1.15 WHIP

2. SF: 62-50, 3.16 ERA, 40/52 saves, 859 hits, 394 runs, 358 earned, 68 hr, 381 walks, 920 K,.229 avg, 1.22 WHIP

We've got you beat in record, ERA, save pct, runs allowed including earned, walks by a landslide, and WHIP. Basically the most important categories.

You guys have a damn good staff, but it's not better than ours.

Well last I checked we had you in all those categories last week, but we had a very bad week and the pitching had a hiccup, so as of this exact moment you guys have bragging rights. A week ago, we had all those... then after taking the series in Philadelphia we gave up 26 runs in 5 games against the Reds and D-Bags. That's what allowed you guys to catch up to us(Thanks Barry Zito for bending over and coughing up 9 runs). Thank heavens we have Jonathan Sanchez back finally to spell Zito in the Rotation.
But like I said before, we have you right where we want you... We know we beat the Phillies in Series all the time. No one is better constructed to beat you guys than us somehow. I think it's a mental thing. No Wonder Philly hasn't won a series IN san francisco Since 06.

Yeah the Marlins were in our heads like that a couple years ago, we could barely win a game at all and lost countless games in a row in Florida.

You know what's happened since then?

They've become our BITCH. Sometimes we just LET them win because we feel sorry for them, and it's 1:30 on Sunday afternoon and we've played baseball for 10 straight days and the previous game was only a few hours ago the night before and we just want to get some god damn SLEEP.

Cody Ross was the only reason you guys took us last year. He was the difference maker. That's fine. So be it. But if Cody fucking ROSS is the guy you have to rely on to get over hump against easily the best team in baseball right now...the Phillies...then I'm afraid your short lived greatness is finished

I don't really like Rick Sutcliff as a broadcaster. He's kind of got this condescending vibe going on.

Linc controlled us, but Cain didn't NECESSARILY. We got to him in the 1st, but then he settled down. So I wouldn't call it a 'pwn' considering he lost.

I do give you props though on your righties being able to handle our lefty heavy lineup.

Yankees or Sawks, either will bring credibilty from the East Coast Bias machine.
 
 
Baseball fans will be treated to an epic pair of Championship series with the usual Sox/Yanks clash and a rematch of Giants/Phils. Drama and bad blood would be everywhere.

All due respect to the Brewers who do have a shot at this thing, as well as the Braves, both will lose valiant fights to the Giants and Phils pitching staffs. The Rangers are presenting fools gold this year. They will fold this year if they face either the Yanks or the Sox. Whoever comes out of the central, probably the Tigers will lose quickly despite a respectable year.

Too bad for Los Piratas man.. I was really pulling for them but they remembered who they were before september rolled around.

The Brewers don't have a shot. Only you guys, us, and maybe Atlanta because of their pitching, which is #5 in the majors. I'm not personally worried about Atl though because we've faced their pitching plenty over the last couple years.

I do get to take credit for calling Jurrjens as having ace type stuff a couple years ago on here when I was arguing about it with Crimson White, a Braves fan, trying to convince him that he had a good staff.
 
 
Damn this was 3 years ago..

 GM reiterates Braves won't part with prospects, even for Peavy 

 
If I were you I'd be happy with Hudson and Jurrjens, and even Hampton now that he'll be healthy. That's not a bad first 3. Keep the prospects, I think you guys need offense right now more than starting pitching. You might want to think about unloading Francouer too, before his value goes completely down the toilet. Trade him for some pitching if you can, and sign Vlad or Milton Bradley. They are both FA's.

 

And good thing they didn't waste their time with Peavy.  
 
 
Mets and Red Sox fan here...guess i can at least look forward to the Bosox being in the playoffs barring a total collapse over the next 40 or so games. I love baseball in general, all i ask is please no Yankees - Phillies World Series again in my lifetime :-)

Hey Trick, you've seen two Philly trophies. Enough is enough. We Giants need to get our 2nd and we'll probly have to go through you again. That is as long as we can just get INTO the playoffs. Score a freakin run Giants will ya!
 
 
How about dan uggla, dood has really turned it around. As for the playoffs, at this rate it looks like the giants might be outside looking in. Still alot of bball left but when u cant score more than three runs a game its trouble.

As for me, even as a braves fan, i have to say the phillies are the it team this year. Stud pitching and a lineup that can easily hit ten runs a game. We will see, any team can run hot or cold come late september and thats when it matters most.

10 runs A game or 10 runs IN a game? nobody's 10 runs per game good. Don't worry about the Giants.. I would worry if they are 2 games back by mid september, but the D-bags gotta go play a tough schedule from here out. We have sub 500 opponents the rest of the way after Atlanta. Now we get to play the Astros 7 games after Atlanta. D-bags got healthy off them. Enjoy Philadelphia snakes.

and yes, it's too bad Uggla's streak came to an end. He really needed that streak. He was an abomination before that.

I'd like to see a real average hitter like Ichiro make a run at DiMaggio. At least a run at Rose's mark of 44.

Definately meant ten runs IN a single game. But the giants they really are last in the NL with 3.4 I believe average runs a game. I agree, the d-bags need to step up to make this any sort of run at the division. As for the giants, unless beltran propels them to the playoffs, (hard to do on the dl, but we will see in sept) they lost their best pitching prospect for a rent-a-player, and if they don't make the playoffs and beltran walks to another team, well than that deal will be a complete bust. I really like how the braves got bourne and didn't really give up anything, and it really really improved our overall game as a team.

Somehow the Giants survive a 4-6 road trip and pick up a game on the D-bags who went into Atlanta and got pwned by the Braves in a sweeping fashion. Thanks Bravos.
Injury Depleted Giants return home in desperate need of offense and the return of Beltran. Much needed day off today.

You've got one tough battle ahead of you defending that title  
 
 
Arizona loses 6th straight. Giants gain ground on a day off. 1 back in the west. Next 12 games against losing teams. Beltran coming back by Friday.

Paulie wanna reconsider your statement about the Brewers not having a shot? They look pretty darn good right now.

I meant no shot in the playoffs, because their pitching will not get them past Phi or SF.
 
 
Face the bold fact: the Sox will take the east.
 
 
man I was watching lincecum against the cubs last night, I was with 2 giants fans and we had to turn it off. Man their offense sucks off goats.
 
 
its a miserable time right now in the city by the bay. New season low after Randy Frickin Wells throws a three hit shutout against the Giants. Randy Wells and his 5 plus era has never thrown a shutout at any level of his professional baseball career? Time to jump off the Golden Gate?
 
 
D-Backs are on a roll again.
 
 
I guess I'll check in here as a long-time Phillies fan. I feel like at this point that's like admitting you're a Yankees fan, but I do get caught by surprise when I see Phillies hate. I'm still not used to the idea that this is no longer the team that trades away Curt Schilling.
 
 
Go RedSox...or Rockies!!

Sorry, haven't the time to read through all 8000 pages of this thread

How's that working out for you? It's September. The socks are done.

Well, the Rockies are 15 out so forget about them. The Red Sucks are only 2 out, but it is September and choke time for them.

It's possible. I'm pretty confident, though. Hammels is much better than he was two years ago and the Phillies have not faired poorly against Sabathia in their three post-season matchups.
 
 
Kennedy won his 19 th game. Cy young nominee? D-Backs are rolling.

25 wins = MVP lock for Verlander

None of that matters. Outside of CC New York doesn't have a legit playoff arm in their rotation.

Any chance the Sox have rides on Josh Beckett's health.
 
 
And NOBODY wants to see Anaheim take the west.

Weaver, Haren, and Santana?

Oh, my....
 
 
But Philly's pitching is boss.

They are the team to beat.

That does not answer the question.

And Yuke and Buc and Bedard and Lackey and if Crawford remembers how to play baseball...

Youk will be fine and we've been fine with Crawford underperforming all season.

Don't expect anything out of Buchholz if he even plays which I seriously doubt happens.

Definitely don't expect to get anything out of Lackey. Consider anything out of him the graviest of gravies.

Bedard will be run out there and all he needs to do is not blow up in any game he starts and give the offense a chance. He can do that.

Honestly though there's no need worrying about the Bedards and Lackeys of the world if you don't have a legit 1-2 at the top.

But I hear ya.

Legit 1-2 can be overrated sometimes. We won in '08 without a legit 1, let alone a 2. Hamels was as close as it came and he was still finding himself then.

Naturally there are exceptions but heading into this post season I think I'm right about the 1-2.

Halladay
Lee
Hamels
Oswalt

You can't beat that with:

Lester

CC

The more I think about it the heavier a favorite you become.

Fuck.

The question is do we go with Oswalt or Worley.
 
 
 This ball is crushed about as hard as you'll ever see. 
 
 
Fuck these guys.

They don't deserve to be in the postseason.
 
 
article,

are your boys ever going to score off this triple a team the yanks have playing? my god someone score!!!!
 
 
Oh so very fucked.
 
 
Shit sons. What an ending.
 
 
Tonight we saw the "choke master" - A-Rod - doing what he does best....... Based loaded, one out, down by two. STRIKE OUT!!!
 
 
K!  
 
 
Wiff!!!!
 
 
Tonight the "too big to fail" NY Yankees......failed. Appropriately, "Choke master" A-Rod struck out for the final out of the game. Their season is now over. Nice try Yankees. Better luck next year!!

Way to go Tigers!!! Sparky would be proud!
 
 
Grab them golf clubs, boys!
 
 
good thing we went with Oswalt whos had an injury shortened season and sub_par performance when he was playing, over the phenom vance worley whos done nothing but WIN all season  
 
 
The better team won tonight.... GO TIGERS!!!!!!
 
 
It's always fun to watch the Yankees lose.

Jim Leyland is the best manager in baseball.

"And this crowd is stunned."
 
 
Real nice to see them pull that game out.
 
 
All I'm gonna say is wow  
 
 
 
All I'm gonna say is wow  

 

Me too. They should have won this series easily....
 
 
i am the fan of pirates, so cheers for pirates....
