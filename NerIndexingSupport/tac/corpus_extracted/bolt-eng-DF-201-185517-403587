Hypothetically speaking what if for instance on 9/11 while Delta flight 1989 was still feared to be a possible hijacking it flew over an unpopulated area and someone decided it should be shot down before it ventures over a more densely inhabited city?

Then after the fact it is not easily established that the plane was indeed in jeopardy at the time of the shoot down?

Do you think some people would have come clean on just such a mistake? How hard would it have been to add it to the other hijacking/s on 9/11? How many would have to know or be in on it ?

Someone might even rationalize that it only happened because of the other hijackings so its still the fault of the terrorists. In the cover story to make up for their mistake they might even turn the passengers into heroes. This little added hero bit would also serve to combat anyone who would dare question the inconsistencies with the official story given. Might it be rationalized that this will help with not letting the terrorists win?

Another version of this could be what if a plane thought to be hijacked was escorted over the Atlantic and shot down then a hijacking story and wreckage faked inland to account for the plane? How many would have to know?

At the Federal Aviation Administration's command center in Herndon, Va., Delta Flight 1989 joins a growing list of suspicious jets. Some of their flight numbers will be scrawled on a white dry-erase board throughout the morning. Eventually, the list will grow to 11.

One, a TWA flight, refuses to land in Pittsburgh and wants to fly on toward Washington. Another, a Midwest Express flight, disappears from radar over West Virginia. And three jets over the Atlantic Ocean are sending out distress signals, the Coast Guard reports.

Hypothetically speaking, LC, what if your entire world view was tragically, hopelessly wrong, and this 'search for truth' you are on was a total waste of time?

Frankly speaking this is about your chosen waste of life. So what's a few more minutes out of a wasted life?

Debunk my scenario and be happy and thankful I gave you something to do.

You're welcome.
 
 
They couldn't even keep  this  a secret.
 
 
What if???

What if the moon really IS made of green cheese?

If you're not careful, you could "what if" yourself into a loony bin.
 
 
What if LC had a conscience?
 
 
 
What if LC had a conscience?

 
Yeah Yeah and what if any of you had a real life or a real story for 9/11?

Now you're all always asking for something to debunk and lucky for you I was feeling generous today so get to it. Or I'm going to start reporting derails.

So?
 
 
 
They couldn't even keep  this  a secret.

 
Did they have other instances of planes being shot down that day by someone else they could blame it on?
 
 
OOOHHHH! LC is mad! What if you made sense?
 
 
 
Hypothetically speaking what if for instance on 9/11 while Delta flight 1989 was still feared to be a possible hijacking it flew over an unpopulated area and someone decided it should be shot down before it ventures over a more densely inhabited city?...Do you think some people would have come clean on just such a mistake?

 

Well, its good to see you creating a reasonably sensible original post.

With the above, youve successfully made the following point: If a person or group of people had inadvertently had a non-hijacked Flight 93 shot down, then that person or group of people might have a vested interest in having the public believe that the plane was in fact hijacked.

Thats fine. You can have that. I certainly wont contest it.
 
 
 
Did they have other instances of planes being shot down that day by someone else they could blame it on?

 
Come again?
 
 
 
Then after the fact it is not easily established that the plane was indeed in jeopardy at the time of the shoot down?

 

On the other hand, its difficult to see the purpose of this counterfactual. It has been fairly straightforwardly established that Flight 93 had been hijacked.
 
 
 
Yeah Yeah and what if any of you had a real life or a real story for 9/11?

 
Do you?
 
 
 
Did they have other instances of planes being shot down that day by someone else they could blame it on?

 
Duh, of course they did! Quick-Draw Dick Cheney shot down Air Force One while he and Da Man were still on it!!1!!11!!! You didn't know that? I knew that. Everyone else here knew that. Where were you?

Dicko and Da Man scrambled into the fighter-trainer from Bushy's Texas Air Guard days that was conveniently secreted in a hidden nacelle behind the First Class crapper room - I mean lavatory. Our heroes saved!!! Mission accomplished!!11!!!!1!
 
 
i think had they shot down delta 1989 they would have announced it immediately, claiming quite proudly that they had averted further tragedy by their quick and decisive actions
 
 
 
Another version of this could be what if a plane thought to be hijacked was escorted over the Atlantic and shot down then a hijacking story and wreckage faked inland to account for the plane? How many would have to know?

 

Further, the amount of infiltration and falsification that would have been required to have successfully faked the crash of Flight 93 would have been so vast that the notion carries a burden of extreme implausibility. Adding to that implausibility the notion that the whole task has been kept a secret for years boarders on the fanciful.

That sound like something you already believe.

But if it wasn't really hijacked or not known either way people might question that. Make a story about hero passengers and people won't be as ready to question it.
 
 
 
Did they have other instances of planes being shot down that day by someone else they could blame it on?

 
Child, could you explain what this is supposed to mean?

Your OP asks if something like this could be covered up, but now you seem to be asking something completely different.

Could you be changing the goalposts again?
 
 
 
Child, could you explain what this is supposed to mean?

 
Were there other civilian planes other then Iran Air Flight 655 that day that went down under different circumstances that it could have been added to?

 
Your OP asks if something like this could be covered up, but now you seem to be asking something completely different.

 
It's not the same. Besides did the US ever fully admit responsibility? Eight years after the fact...

In 1996, the United States and Iran reached "an agreement in full and final settlement of all disputes, differences, claims, counterclaims" relating to the incident at the International Court of Justice. As part of the settlement, the United States agreed to pay $61.8 million in compensation for the Iranians killed. The United States did not admit responsibility or apologize to the Iranian government.

 
Could you be changing the goalposts again?

 
Was I the one to bring up something unrelated? Who was that again?
 
 
 
Then after the fact it is not easily established that the plane was indeed in jeopardy at the time of the shoot down?

 

Without question, the dumbest post I have ever read.

What does it matter? How does this relate to your question in the OP?

What your asking for is an impossible scenario that would mimic exactly 9/11. That's just not going to happen, therefore your question is unanswerable.

Still irrelevant. What you asked for is if something like this could be covered up. My example shows that it is very difficult to cover up mistakes. A trial and an investigation always follow such disasters and eventually things are uncovered.

If the scenario you're proposing had happened, an investigation would probably have uncovered the mistake.

 
Was I the one to bring up something unrelated? Who was that again?

 
I was answering your OP.
 
 
LastChild? Thoughts, etc.?
 
 
 
LastChild? Thoughts, etc.?

 
Yes flight 93 is the most obvious to link to this possible scenario but I wasn't excluding any other flights on 9/11 either. I also don't see the need for all kinds of people to have to be in on it. Even the military personnel shooting down the planes could still think they were hijacked or part of a drill over the Atlantic unrelated to 9/11.

Oh I beg to differ. There are plenty of other instances that this administration has responded to, screwed up, and tried to spin to their advantage after the fact. This is right up their alley. It's what they're famous for.

It's not irrelevant and you brought it up. I got that right from your link. It hasn't even been eight years after 9/11. Its 20 years after the comparison you offered up and still the US hasn't fully taken responsibility for it. And what does this present administration ever take responsibility for? It's like they're allergic to it.

 
I was answering your OP.

 
Try again.
 
 
 
Without question, the dumbest post I have ever read.

 
Don't be modest. Try reading some of your own.

So NORAD orders a fighter to shoot down a commercial airliner over US airspace and you don't think many people would have known about it? Or that the people involved would have just thought it was a drill? You don't think that any of these people would be asking questions afterwards?

Once again we see just how little you understand of how the world actually works.

Yes, and you know this because they have been uncovered. Therefore you are proving my point.

Taking responsiblity has nothing to do with your OP.

You're asking if the circumstances could be covered up, obviously here they haven't since we know what happened, regardless of the official US's statement.
 
 
 
But if it wasn't really hijacked or not known either way people might question that. Make a story about hero passengers and people won't be as ready to question it.

 
9/11 was basically about the government and the military being humiliated, if there was anything they could take credit for im sure they would

All right. So, perhaps you can detail a method by which these hypothetical conspirators could have successfully covered up such an event. If you could make it as detailed as possible, that would be helpful. We could then seek to find problems with this scenario and you could defend it.
 
 
 
If they ask and are told it was hijacked then what?

 
As soon as the 'official story' is presented what difference would it make WHAT they were told? They would know for a fact the official story was a lie. Despite your cynical world view there are honest people out there even in the government and military, and unlike people in your movement these folks would not only have the REAL truth, but they would be in a position to do something about it.
 
 
"Debunk my scenario".

Um...
 
 
 
I also don't see the need for all kinds of people to have to be in on it. Even the military personnel shooting down the planes could still think they were hijacked or part of a drill over the Atlantic unrelated to 9/11.

 

Im not sure what you can mean by that. Bear in mind that the pilots and ground personnel in question would have just successfully shot down a real-world Boeing 7x7 with Delta/United markings. Im not sure how you could convince them that they had just taken part in an exercise so routine as to not be worth talking about, especially if it took place on September 11th 2001.
 
 
 
Yes, and you know this because they have been uncovered. Therefore you are proving my point.

 
Really? Or are they still working on trying to fully uncover some of them? When will the story in the link you posted to be fully settled?

 
Taking responsibility has nothing to do with your OP.

 
My scenario has everything to do with taking responsibility for a mistake made instead of just having an investigation that's only purpose is to whitewash that responsibility.

 
You're asking if the circumstances could be covered up, obviously here they haven't since we know what happened, regardless of the official US's statement.

 
Obviously? Why because some official US statement told you so? Are you sure you understand the op?

So you blindly trust. And?
 
 
 
9/11 was basically about the government and the military being humiliated, if there was anything they could take credit for im sure they would

 
Shooting down a plane in error full of your own citizens would be something to take credit for or something to be humiliated over?

I guess it depends huh? jeez
 
 
 
I also don't see the need for all kinds of people to have to be in on it. Even the military personnel shooting down the planes could still think they were hijacked or part of a drill over the Atlantic unrelated to 9/11.

 

Further, if the plane in question hadnt actually been hijacked, then its transponder would never have been switched off, and air traffic control would have never lost track of it. Consequently, they would have witnessed the aircraft in question going out over the Atlantic and/or simply breaking up at the genuine crash-site. This event would have also been captured on their radar tapes.

They wouldn't need to be told anything more then what you are told and believe. How many questions are you asking?

Flight Delta 1989 had a transponder no? They believed at one point it to be hijacked no?

What flight were they mistaking it with? How did that happen?

Flight Delta 1989 had a transponder no? They believed at one point it to be hijacked no? What flight were they mistaking it with? How did that happen?

 

Exactly. Delta 1989 had a functioning transponder. Thus, air traffic control would have never lost track of it. Consequently, they would have witnessed it going out over the Atlantic and/or simply breaking up at the genuine crash-site. This event would have also been captured on their radar tapes.

Incidentally, as I understand it, the reason that they believed it to be hijacked was due to the fact that someone onboard was exhibiting suspicious behaviour (especially when viewed in the context of the other events of the day, of course.) Moreover, I dont think they confused it with any other plane. They just thought it was hijacked. It was a false alarm.
 
 
 
Frankly speaking this is about your chosen waste of life. So what's a few more minutes out of a wasted life?

Debunk my scenario and be happy and thankful I gave you something to do.

You're welcome.

 

How's the supply-and-demand thing coming along? Still absolutely clueless, huh? That's too bad. I think you've earned a break.

Here's an entertaining hypothetical scenario:

Through magic, Bush & Co. divine that Flights 11 and 175 have been hijacked by jihadists who intend to crash them into the Twin Towers. They order them intercepted and shot down over heavily-populayed metropolitan areas. The death toll on the ground, not to mention the passengers and crews, is considerable.

Please explain why your side would not shriek for Bush's impeachment. Michael Moore (and thousands of dotty academics) would be quick to opine that the poor darlings who took over the planes were merely protesting American imperialism and intended to land peacefully in the workers' paradise of Cuba. How would Bush have persuaded people like, uh, you that he had averted, uh, what actually happened on 9/11/01.

Take your time.
 
 
 
If they ask and are told it was hijacked then what?

 
Then they tell people about how they foiled a hijacking plot. If the government deny anything happened, then they go to the media and tell their story. Has that happened?

 
And there weren't any drills on 9/11?

 
None that involved scrambling fighters to shoot down commercial flights. That was real world.
 
 
What if 9-11 was an inside job?

Would somebody be able to prove it?
 
 
 
Shooting down a plane in error full of your own citizens would be something to take credit for or something to be humiliated over?

I guess it depends huh? jeez

 
shooting down a plane that is going to kill hundreds of other people, yes, as i said previously i think they would have been quick to point out that they averted further tragedy

but this is why hypothetical questions are pointless, we can both simply hypothesize that we are right and the other is wrong and it gets us both a whole lotta nowhere
 
 
 
What if 9-11 was an inside job?

Would somebody be able to prove it?

 
What if I had a female conjoined twin, would everytime we go out be considered dating?  
 
 
 
Exactly. Delta 1989 had a functioning transponder. Thus, air traffic control would have never lost track of it. Consequently, they would have witnessed it going out over the Atlantic and/or simply breaking up at the genuine crash-site. This event would have also been captured on their radar tapes.

 
Boston did lose contact with flight 1989 when they failed to respond. Who is to say how lont the powers that be would wait to find out id it was hijacked. Are they going to wait for it to crash into another building?

 
Incidentally, as I understand it, the reason that they believed it to be hijacked was due to the fact that someone onboard was exhibiting suspicious behaviour (especially when viewed in the context of the other events of the day, of course.)

No.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_A...es_Flight_1989 

A Cleveland controller thought he heard "Get out of here" and "We have a bomb on board" coming from Delta 1989. The Delta pilot denied any cockpit intrusion and stated that everyone on board was fine. It was later confirmed that that mysterious transmission had come from United Flight 93 which was in the same vicinity as 1989

Sounds like they had it mixed up with another flight even thought the transponder on 1989 was functioning. How did that happen?

Both of those points look to concern radio transmissions. I’m referring to transponder signals. They never mixed up the transponder signals.

Given that the transponder would not have been deactivated, air traffic control would have never lost track of the plane. Consequently, they would have witnessed it going out over the Atlantic and/or simply breaking up at the genuine crash-site. This event would have also been captured on their radar tapes.

Further to the above, the very page you cite emphasises my point:

 
Delta 1989 never turned off its transponder and NEADS never lost radar contact with the flight. NEADS, the FAA Herndon Command Center, and Cleveland Center tracked Delta 1989 until its eventual landing.

Further to the above, the very page you cite emphasises my point:

 
So what? Some still thought it was hijacked which leaves open the possibility that they might have shot it down deciding that they couldn't wait for confirmation it wasn't hijacked because waiting would give it time to get near a populated area. Once shot down they might realize it was an accident. What then? Some also thought that radio transmissions from 93 were coming from 1989. Lots of confusion and little time to decide how to respond.

Well the official version leaves open the possibility for just about anything but nuts. It has plenty in the nuts department.
 
 
 
What if I had a female conjoined twin, would everytime we go out be considered dating?  

 
No being conjoined would be a good cover story. What excuse do you use when you date your sister?
 
 
 
Hypothetically speaking what if for instance on 9/11 while Delta flight 1989 was still feared to be a possible hijacking it flew over an unpopulated area and someone decided it should be shot down before it ventures over a more densely inhabited city?

 

They would have had to intercept it first. NORAD didn't hear about Delta 1989 until 9:41 a.m. It responded to communications from the ground and landed safely in Ohio six minutes later without having been intercepted by any US forces. There is no data on how long it would have taken the Air Force to get a fighter up to it. There is no data on what 1989 would have done if it had not responded to Cleaveland and obeyed the FAA's general order to land. So it is impossible to speculate about how that scenario might have played out in a way that would have resulted in 1989 being shot down.

 
Then after the fact it is not easily established that the plane was indeed in jeopardy at the time of the shoot down?

 

You are correct. It is not easily established.

 
Do you think some people would have come clean on just such a mistake?

 

Yes.

 
How hard would it have been to add it to the other hijacking/s on 9/11?

 

During the morning hours of 9/11, easy. During the ensuing 48 hours, increasingly difficult. During the ensuing year, impossible.

 
How many would have to know or be in on it ?

 

For the lie to stick? At the very least:

Every single flight controler at Cleaveland
Almost every single flight controler at Boston
Every single employee of the FAA and the NTSB
The couple hundred employees at Delta with access to the passenger manifests
Two dozen or so employees at Logan Int'l Airport who helped get the flight boarded and the passengers checked in.
Every single family member of every single passenger on flight 1989
Two hundred US military personnel.
 
 
 
Find out what happen to all that oil missing from Iraq yet and what those crooks you support did with it? You know the same crooks who claimed it would pay for the reconstruction?

Will that be happening any time soon? Who is taking their time about that?

 

Now I know you're putting us on. Yes, "I"--me--all by myself--with no help from any news services--found out, through my private intelligence-gathering resources, that the missing Iraqi oil, thought to be lost to sabotage by insurgents and sold by corrupt officials, has in fact been--hold on to your hat-- LOST TO SABOTAGE BY INSURGENTS AND SOLD BY CORRUPT OFFICIALS! I mean, stop the friggin' presses. Geez!

Do you write your own material? The Americans who thought that Iraqi oil revenues would help to pay the costs of reconstruction were disappointed when revenues fell below expectations, as a result of sabotage and corruption. Now we learn that Iraq will reap considerable benefits, to the tune of $70 billion, from the spike in oil prices. Obviously, we have to press the Iraqis to pay their share of the freight.

Insanely, despite your previous humiliation on this very subject, you are persisting with your absurd slander of nameless Americans, although you can't begin to figure out how the people who are being hurt by the loss of Iraqi oil COULD, THROUGH SOME FORM OF ECONOMIC MAGIC, ACTUALLY BENEFIT BY IT.

When I asked you to learn the difference between supply and demand, I asked far too much. The request, although appropriate to a bright ten-year-old, is unfair to you. Let us attempt something much more modest.

Begin with the optimistic assertion by American officials that Iraqi oil production would bounce back from its pre-war lows and allow the new Iraqi government to pay at least some of the reconstruction costs. Keep this concept in mind: if the Iraqis pay more, we pay less. File a related concept alongside the first one: It is desirable to pay less.

At the risk of overloading you, I ask you to consider--while not forgetting these two concepts--that Americans are probably not sabotaging Iraqi oil production in order to cost America more money. Accordingly, I ask that you accept that America wants Iraq to shoulder some of the financial burdens because it is in America's interest. Note that you are not required to modify your irrational hatred of America to make this concession to reason and sanity.

Your claim that "crooks" are, in effect, stealing from themselves in order to discredit their own earlier assessment is, to put it charitably, counter-intuitive. To put it more accurately, the claim is bizarre to the point of idiocy. Your mad fantasy that somehow, for some utterly inexplicable reason, Americans are behind the sabotage the rest of the world attributes to insurgents and corrupt Iraqi officials illustrates the sheer hopelessness of engaging you in a coherent discussion. You don't even understand what you're accusing your imaginary conspiracy of doing.

Oh, thanks for ignoring my question. We expected nothing else.
 
 
 
Was the 9-11 investigation an inside job?

 

What? You mean you've emerged from your self-induced coma and learned that there really was an investigation!?!? A medical miracle has come to pass.
 
 
If all the ifs and buts were candy and nuts, what a wonderful Christmas it would be!
 
 
 
For the lie to stick? At the very least:

Every single flight controler at Cleaveland

 
Nope

 
Almost every single flight controler at Boston

 
Nope

 
Every single employee of the FAA and the NTSB

 
Hardly

 
The couple hundred employees at Delta with access to the passenger manifests

 
Why?

 
Two dozen or so employees at Logan Int'l Airport who helped get the flight boarded and the passengers checked in.

 
Don't they have to board a plane and be checked in to be shot down? What are you talking about?

 
Every single family member of every single passenger on flight 1989 Two hundred US military personnel.

 
93 could have been shot down and few if any of these people would have needed to know anything depending on the scenario.
 
 
 
Nope

Nope

Hardly

Why?

Don't they have to board a plane and be checked in to be shot down? What are you talking about?

 
So do you see now why these types of hypothetical scenarios are useless? I do.

 
93 could have been shot down and few if any of these people would have needed to know anything depending on the scenario.

 
Any chance you could perhaps justify this statement?

I'll hold my breath while I wait.  
 
 
 
So what? Some still thought it was hijacked which leaves open the possibility that they might have shot it down deciding that they couldn't wait for confirmation it wasn't hijacked because waiting would give it time to get near a populated area. Once shot down they might realize it was an accident. What then? Some also thought that radio transmissions from 93 were coming from 1989. Lots of confusion and little time to decide how to respond.

 

Well, I’ll temporarily agree with your first sentence, for the sake of argument more than anything else: It’s just about conceivable – although extremely unlikely – that Delta 1989 or another plane in a similar position – if things had turned out very differently – could have been shot down inadvertently.

My points, however, are that:
The pilots and ground personnel in question would have just successfully shot down a real-world Boeing 7x7 with Delta/United markings. I’m not sure how they could be convinced that they had just taken part in an exercise so routine as to not be worth talking about, especially if it took place on September 11th 2001. If the plane in question hadn’t actually been hijacked, then its transponder would never have been switched off, and air traffic control would have never lost track of it. Consequently, they would have witnessed it going out over the Atlantic and/or simply breaking up at the genuine crash-site. This event would have also been captured on their radar tapes. In light of the above, we can see that the notion that such an event could be covered-up with any straightforward degree of secrecy – even at this very early stage of its development – is extremely implausible.
 
 
 
Oh, thanks for ignoring my question. We expected nothing else.

 
Thanks for ignoring mine. When will the Iraq oil start paying for the war? Got any inside info on that? Does OReilly email that kind of information to you in his talking points?

Your question is your typical disingenuous nonsense. I asked whether you'd shriek louder if Bush had figured out a reason to shoot down the two planes headed for the WTC than you do over his inability to do so. Your silence said everything that needed to be said.

Nobody can be certain when Iraq will start shouldering its fair share of the financial burdens. Your insinuation that America is, incomprehensibly, behind the destruction of the Iraqi oil thought to be destroyed by insurgents is quite mad. Your obtuseness on this point is breathtaking to behold.

I'll repeat: you don't have the slightest idea of what you're accusing your imaginary conspiracy of doing.

Okay, let me play this out in my mind to see if it makes sense.

NWO Flunkie: Mrs. Smith, I'm very sorry to tell you that your husband was killed when we shot down Delta 1989. But you should know that the flight had been hijacked and it was heading for a very important and crowded public landmark, so your husband's death saved thousands of lives.
Mrs. Smith: What were their names?
NWO Flunkie : Who?
Mrs. Smith: The hijackers.
NWO Flunkie: What hijackers?
Mrs. Smith: Of Flight 1989.
NWO Flunkie: Oh, um... Ahmad and Jabul..
Mrs. Smith: Well, Delta doesn't have anyone by those names on the passenger manifest.
NWO Flunkie: Oh, they were using fake names.
Mrs. Smith: Great. What were their fake names?
NWO Flunkie : Sam Flinderman and Noah Dorsey.
Mrs. Smith: Okay, those names are on the passenger manifest. But when I went to the huge Flight 1989 memorial, I met Sam Flinderman's parents and they're from Winetka.
NWO Flunkie: Did they say which Winetka because I'm pretty sure there's one in Iraq. Anyway, this is all classified and I can't say anything else.
Mrs. Smith: Can you say what the intended target was?
NWO Flunkie: It was the White House.
Mrs. Smith: That's odd because the FAA has an uninterrupted track of Flight 1989 heading due west and never turning back to the east.
NWO Flunkie: I meant the Western White House. In Crawford, Texas.
Mrs. Smith: Was anybody even at the Western White House at the time.
NWO Flunkie: I'm sure somebody was. Look, the truth is that we thought the flight had been hijacked, there was a lot of chaos that morning, we did our best but we decided that the safest course of action was to shoot it down.
Mrs. Smith: Thanks. I'm going to sue you now.
NWO Flunkie: I completely understand.
 
 
Remember what my point concerning the pilots and ground personnel was in reference to:

 
Even the military personnel shooting down the planes could still think they were hijacked or part of a drill over the Atlantic unrelated to 9/11.

 

 
[The pilots and ground personnel who had shot down the plane] wouldn't need to be told anything more then what you are told and believe. How many questions are you asking?

 

 
The pilots and ground personnel in question would have just successfully shot down a real-world Boeing 7x7 with Delta/United markings. Im not sure how they could be convinced that they had just taken part in an exercise so routine as to not be worth talking about, especially if it took place on September 11th 2001.

I'm pretty sure he wouldn't have a choice. The shoot-down would be a major part of the subsequent investigation. The observers on the ground, the officer who gave the order, and the pilot who executed the order would all be interviewed extensively by the FBI, several military and congressional committees, and the 9/11 Commission. Sensor data would be analyzed. The decision-making process would be scrutinized. And just as on the real 9/11, the result would be "we made the best decisions we could with the resources and information available to us at the time". No cover-ups, no bizarre fairy tales. Just the plain, complicated, ugly truth, however tragic or heroic it might be.

Yeah but we are talking about people who have a motto of "why tell the truth when we can lie and milk that lie for all it's worth?". Like Pat Tillman remember him? Was there a purpose to hiding what that was all about? They like to lie and rub your nose in it and they like it even more when they know that you know they are lying and can't do anything about it. They're creating their own reality because they are an empire now and well.. they can and you can't. ha ha

Yeah, and look how well that Pat Tillman lie turned out. It didn't take very long for the investigations and the whistle-blowers to reveal the true story, did it? And that was a relatively minor lie, with relatively trivial investigations. If the military couldn't even keep something like the real Pat Tillman story secret, how could they keep your hypothetical airliner shoot-down secret? Additionally, their failure in the Pat Tillman case argues against the existence of a single, cohesive cabal that always lies and always gets away with it. All the evidence points to the conclusion that, at best, whenever one faction lies, another faction blows the whistle.

Oh yeah sure. Tillman's murder has been all cleared up hasn't it?

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Tillman 

Tillman's mother continues to reject the Pentagon's characterization of the officers' offenses as "errors" in reporting Tillman's death, because several officers have said they made conscious decisions not to tell the Tillman family that fratricide was suspected.
 
 
 
Remember what my point concerning the pilots and ground personnel was in reference to:
I would be glad address your subsequent question in due course. For now, however, can I take it that you concede the point I was making above and realise that convincing the pilots and ground personnel that they had just taken part in an exercise would be extremely implausible?

 
Why? Were there no drills going on that day? What's to convince? Just that one thing had nothing to do with the other? You already bought that much why wouldn't they?

That would because, unlike me, the pilots and ground personnel in question would have just successfully shot down a real-world Boeing 7x7 with Delta/United markings. Im not sure how they could be convinced that they had just taken part in an exercise so routine as to not be worth talking about, especially if it took place on September 11th 2001.

Quick-Draw Dicko Cheney isn't getting away with shooting down Air Force One, that's what "they" are not getting away with. YOU may not have heard of the accountability but I have cuz I got spy-friends in The Gov. I was in the Navy and when you get discharged they issue you 2 spy-friends for every year of active duty and I done 5 years so that's eleven spy-friends.

This CIA spook-friend told me that they confiscated Dicko's shotgun. In addition to the quail beak they found on the trigger guard (which ties him to the Corpus Christi lawyer shooting), they also found the doorknob to the First Class crapper on Air Force One in the left barrel, about two-thirds of the way in.
 
 
LC your toxic world view is blinding you to the fact that many people not only have brains, but have consciences as well.

You subscribe to the 'mindless automaton' theory of why nobody has come forward to 'out' the 'Man' in the last 7 years. Good luck with that.
 
 
 
Again were there no drills going down on 9/11 that supposedly had nothing to do with 9/11? How many of them are questioning that?

 

The problem is that exercises do not consist of shooting down real-world Boeing 7x7s with Delta/United markings. Therefore, the pilots and ground personnel in question would realise that it was not an exercise (especially when they would have been told as much beforehand); for one thing, you simply cannot tell pilots, etc. that the missiles that they just fired and the commercial airliners that they just saw fall out of the sky were all in their minds. Therefore, it is implausible in the extreme to think that they could be convinced that they had just taken part in an exercise so routine as to not be worth talking about, especially if it took place on September 11th 2001.

You and others here still try to explain things away based on faith and nothing else. Faith in people who don't deserve it.

Now as for the military if you want some possible scenarios here you go but remember there could be one you or I haven't thought of. There are people whose job it is to think these things up and I'm not one of them.

If they shot down the plane over land you don't know that they got that close before they fired. How close do they have to be to shoot down a passenger jet? What if it's just the wrong United or wrong American plane? Do they have to be close enough to see all the markings? Maybe they are ordered to shoot as soon as they have a visual. Now I've seen plenty of footage of the planes that hit the towers but I don't see any markings on any of them telling me for sure what airline they are from never mind exactly what plane they are. That's even when you slow it up and zoom in.

Now the scenario over the Atlantic is that the plane is hijacked or thought to be and escorted or lost over the Atlantic. You can't very well escort the plane back over land so what do you do? Even if you have contact with the pilot how do you know the hijacker doesn't have a knife to his throat telling him what to say? You thought you heard a disturbance so now what? You also dont have any time because you have to respond to another out of 11 possible hijacked planes that day. So you get the order and the plane is shot down but you still don't know if it was hijacked for sure. You as the shoot-down pilot are going to question whatever story the powers that be decide on after the fact? Why?

And finally what if you are a pilot and you get up in the morning to participate in a drill were you shoot down what you are told is a drone over the Atlantic from a distance. You do it and afterwards are told your drill and the 9/11 attacks are two different things that didn't have anything to do with each other. Other then because you were performing this drill you couldn't get back to protect the states in time. You're going to question it? Based on what information?
 
 
 
You and others here still try to explain things away based on faith and nothing else. Faith in people who don't deserve it.

 
Obviously your post is alot of fluff that doesn't address Par's point but may I ask who do you mean by "people who don't deserve it"?

Exactly my point. People directly involved in the cover-up have openly admitted that they acted like jackasses, and revealed the existence of the cover-up they had initially been involved in perpetrating. They could have kept their mouths shut, and made themselves look good by keeping the real story covered up, but no, they had to go and shoot themselves in the foot...

In the face of such examples as these, why should I believe that your hypothetical shoot-down pilot would behave any different?

How close would YOU get before killing 100 or so people? From a case you may have heard about...

 
Eventually, two F-16s from Fargo, N.D., moved in close to look into the windows to see if the pilot was slumped over and to help clear air space. Officials hoped that the F-16s could provide assistance to anyone on board who might have helped land the plane safely.
The pilots drew close and noticed no structural damage but were unable to see into the Learjet because its windows were frosted over, indicating the temperature inside was well below freezing.

NWO Flunkie: Shoot down the plane as soon as you have a missile lock.
Pilot: Um... I'm outside of a restricted military training airspace. That plane could be anything. There are about 3,000 civilian flights over the US at any given time.
NWO Flunkie: Just follow your orders without question. It's a drone. This is just an exercise.
Pilot: An exercise in what? If this were a real situation, I would work harder to confirm the identity of the plane. So, shouldn't I do that now?
NWO Flunkie: Shoot it! Shoot it! Shoot it!
Pilot: Is there anybody else down there that I can talk to?

 
Now I've seen plenty of footage of the planes that hit the towers but I don't see any markings on any of them telling me for sure what airline they are from never mind exactly what plane they are. That's even when you slow it up and zoom in.

 

Really, LastChild? Really?

Let me try to explain this: If I'm standing at the side of the highway and a car whizzes by at 70 mph, I may not be able to see in the window to determine whether the driver is a man or woman. However, if I'm in another car on the highway and I'm also going about 70 mph, I can pull up to the car and look at the driver very, very easily. The car's velocity relative to my own would be about zero.

How can you not know that?

 
You as the shoot-down pilot are going to question whatever story the powers that be decide on after the fact? Why?

 

Because the pilot is not a cylon.

Also... and I've already made this clear... the families of the victims are going to sue the government. In that lawsuit, they are going to investigate and discover all of this information. They are going to find the pilot and depose him under oath. Even if the pilot doesn't care enough to compare his memories to others, he's going to be forced to.

 
You're going to question it? Based on what information?

 

Based on the following information:

1. Flight 1989 will have disappeared in the same place and at the same time as the drone the pilot thinks he shot down.
2. In your scenario, the pilots are only told it was a drill after the fact. By that point, they'll have already learned that Flight 1989 was shot down.
3. The pilots would have to believe that, during 9/11, they were made to participate in a drill that was not called off once NORAD became aware of the hijackings and that they were still put through a drill when they could have been diverted to protect New York or Washington.
4. The pilots will be forced to question it in the lawsuit by family members.
5. The pilots are human and you tend to find killing innocent civilians disagreeable.
6. The pilots' brains function.
 
 
 
Well that's all I'm getting. Supposedly how some people are above lying or not coming forward. Got anything else? I'm the one the debunkers are always demanding a CT from like baby birds with their mouth open wide for a worm. Well I stepped up and this is all I get?

lame

 
You stepped up by providing a scenario which did not happen, could not have happened, and then you claim victory because it cannot be "debunked" in your eyes.

That's faith, kiddo. I'm not sure why you think you're suddenly above it all- but when you talk about "debunkers" being faith-based... you open up a whole new world of pain for yourself.

You have no evidence, remember...
 
 
 
Please provide evidence that there are people in the military whose job is to think up complicated cover stories for vast, incomprehensible, vague conspiracies. I don't think that job actually exists.

 
That's not exactly what I claimed. You don't really need me for an argument just go get a mirror.

 http://www.usatoday.com/news/washing...18-norad_x.htm 

NORAD officials have acknowledged that "scriptwriters" for the drills included the idea of hijacked aircraft being used as weapons.

"Threats of killing hostages or crashing were left to the scriptwriters to invoke creativity and broaden the required response," Maj. Gen. Craig McKinley, a NORAD official, told the 9/11 commission. No exercise matched the specific events of Sept. 11, NORAD said.

 
NWO Flunkie: Shoot down the plane as soon as you have a missile lock.
Pilot: Um... I'm outside of a restricted military training airspace. That plane could be anything. There are about 3,000 civilian flights over the US at any given time.
NWO Flunkie: Just follow your orders without question. It's a drone. This is just an exercise.
Pilot: An exercise in what? If this were a real situation, I would work harder to confirm the identity of the plane. So, shouldn't I do that now?
NWO Flunkie: Shoot it! Shoot it! Shoot it!
Pilot: Is there anybody else down there that I can talk to?

 
You would be correct in guessing that military drill scriptwriting job wouldn't exist for the likes of you.

 
Really, LastChild? Really?

 
Yes really. "scriptwriters". Your tax dollars at work. Still according to the official version we were unprepared and unprotected.

 
Let me try to explain this: If I'm standing at the side of the highway and a car whizzes by at 70 mph, I may not be able to see in the window to determine whether the driver is a man or woman. However, if I'm in another car on the highway and I'm also going about 70 mph, I can pull up to the car and look at the driver very, very easily. The car's velocity relative to my own would be about zero.

 
That's if you catch up to it in time. There was no time. There were possible multiple hijackings going on. Why is it so far fetched that after 2 planes crash into the WTC and some are thought to be heading for Washington that someone might have decided to shoot first and ask questions later?

 
How can you not know that?

 
Do you know the offical version? Do you need to in order to accept it?

 
Because the pilot is not a cylon.

 
There you go arguing with yourself again.

 
Also... and I've already made this clear... the families of the victims are going to sue the government. In that lawsuit, they are going to investigate and discover all of this information. They are going to find the pilot and depose him under oath. Even if the pilot doesn't care enough to compare his memories to others, he's going to be forced to.

 
Really? Like the families who held out and sued the airlines after they first had to refuse the GovT buyout that would have stripped them of any right to sue the airlines. All the holdouts so far have settled and under the condition that anything they uncovered in their investigation would not be revealed.

So I guess you are still at a loss. Try to learn the version it is you are failing to support will ya?

 
Based on the following information:

1. Flight 1989 will have disappeared in the same place and at the same time as the drone the pilot thinks he shot down.

 
So what? That's a small coincidence compared to all the other ones you have already bought into.

 
2. In your scenario, the pilots are only told it was a drill after the fact. By that point, they'll have already learned that Flight 1989 was shot down.

 
Not all my versions. Try reading again. Again so what if they are?

 
3. The pilots would have to believe that, during 9/11, they were made to participate in a drill that was not called off once NORAD became aware of the hijackings and that they were still put through a drill when they could have been diverted to protect New York or Washington.

 
Both could have happened. In your version did they get back in time? Were they all even called from the admitted drills that were going on?

 
4. You will be forced to question it in the lawsuit by family members.

 
Covered.

 
5. You are human and you tend to find killing innocent civilians disagreeable.

 
Covered. This is your faith again. I'll remind you that on 9/11 it was humans killing humans. Is this news to you?

 
6. Your brain functions.

 
Are military personnel generally encouraged to come forward and reveal exactly what they were up to during an attack or a drill or might that be considered a security risk? And would they themselves be encouraged to come forward based on a hunch or a coincidence and not much else?

Are you sure your brain functions?
 
 
There's no way this could work.

Alright, it's possible for the military to accidentally shoot down a non-hijacked airliner. It isn't possible for them to cover it up.

The FBI is going to start investigating who the hijackers were immediately.

The NTSB is going to be investigating as well, and will be coordinating with the FBI.

The airline, in this case Delta, will be investigating as well to see if they were in anyway liable.

The military branches involved will have conducted an After Action Review immediately after their missions are completed.

The FAA will conduct an internal review of all their actions, what they knew and when they knew it.

Congress will direct the GAO to investigate all these other investigations to see if there needs to be any federal policy changes.

It's possible you might frustrate one of any of those investigations but.... all of them? How are you going to do that without the conspiracy becoming so large and cumbersome that it fails under its own weight?

Hey, pally. I actually IS a Hollywood scriptwriter and I resent the implication that I would do such a thing, on spec.

Okay you dragged it out of me, The Gov actually DID option my script whereby a Space Beam Laser Plasma Partical Charged Weepun was the Real Culprit, so I made some decent coin there. And they got some lady dentist to promote the idea to the great unwashed masses. But I only did it because The Gov allocated some up-front cashola. What - I'm sposta write on spec?

Maximum speed of an F-16: 1,500 mph.
Speed of a 757: 530 mph
Range of an AIM-9 Sidewinder: 11.3 miles

Time it would take an F-16 to close on a 757 from the farthest possible distance that it could fire a missile: Approximately 41 seconds.

What they didn't get away with was the covering up of Tillman's death.

You are alleging that in situations like this (i.e. involving some kind of government cover-up), people don't come forward to tell the truth and instead maintain a conspiracy of silence. And yet here we have a case in which the government attempted a cover-up where people peripherally involved coming forward and the media brought the truth to the general public.

 
Has there been some kind of accountability I haven't heard about?

 
Different issue altogether. The topic at hand is how you feel that every other person on the planet is a spineless, amoral coward never willing to do the right thing. The Tillman example handily demonstrates your rather cynical view of mankind to be just another one of your fantasies.

They didn't try to cover up his death they tried to cover up how he died and they still haven't come completely clean.

This is one of the most asinine arguments the debunkers try to push forward. The Government has been caught multiple times trying to cover-up different situations. Even after they have been caught they still don't come completely clean. How does that fact mean they were caught every time in every situation? If they were to get away with covering up a certain situation then how the hell would you know about it?

The Tillman example is a valid spineless, amoral, and cowardly, situation that the US military and the administration were involved in when trying to pull off using his death or murder and spinning it for their own advantage.
 
 
 
But that's not the topic of this thread is it? Is the Bush administration the ones who would decide on the procedure to take in your hypothetical scenario?

 
They would be the ones to decide the shoot-down (not the pilot), the story given afterwards, and the ones to control the investigation and the limiting of that investigation.
 
 
 
Why? Were there no drills going on that day? What's to convince? Just that one thing had nothing to do with the other? You already bought that much why wouldn't they?

 

This is just a quick point for now. Ive noticed youve made use of some variation or another of the following argument a number of times in this thread:
The official story of the 9/11 attacks is a fabrication, or at least involves a significant cover-up of some description. The official story of the 9/11 attacks is widely believed. Therefore, this similarly fictitious hypothetical cover-story would also be widely believed. The problem is that none of us accept that the official story of the 9/11 attacks is a fabrication. Consequently, employing the notion that it is as a premise is a perfectly illegitimate more: It commits the begging the question fallacy.

It would be nice if you could address this point.

You're obfuscating this issue, most likely on purpose. This is the original post I was responding to:

 
Yeah, and look how well that Pat Tillman lie turned out. It didn't take very long for the investigations and the whistle-blowers to reveal the true story, did it? And that was a relatively minor lie, with relatively trivial investigations. If the military couldn't even keep something like the real Pat Tillman story secret, how could they keep your hypothetical airliner shoot-down secret? Additionally, their failure in the Pat Tillman case argues against the existence of a single, cohesive cabal that always lies and always gets away with it. All the evidence points to the conclusion that, at best, whenever one faction lies, another faction blows the whistle.

 
The bolded portion encapsulates the issue I was addressing and one which you seem to disagree with, or at the very least don't take into consideration.

You can whine and screech all you want about how corrupt our government is, but that's not the point and I doubt many people here will disagree with you. However, history has shown time and time again that when they attempt a cover-up in the public arena, people come forward and investigations are launched that reveal the truth.

The Tillman case is a prime example of the government trying to sell the American public one version of events, and the truth being revealed via whistle-blowers and media investigations.

The fact that a relatively simple incident involving the death of just one man couldn't be successfully covered up, casts a very dubious light on your assertion that a massive and complex event involving the death of 3,000 people could be.
 
 
 
Three words: Risk - benefit analysis.

Say them slowly. Risk. Benefit. Analysis.

Risk: Get caught. End of the Republican party, perhaps full scale American revolution. Perpetrators (that's you here... it's make believe!) probably executed.

Benefit: Erm... Well, wouldn't have to explain to distraught families that you'd actively intervened to kill them, notwithstanding the fact that they were going to die anyway, and your intervention saved other lives. Generous NWO pension scheme.

Analysis: Go forth, and analyse, oh fledgeling thinker, oh delicate protege! You can do it! WE BELIEVE IN YOU*!

* one of the above statements not technically true.

 
Oops. Clearly wasn't paying attention - it was late. Central point still stands though. They wouldn't attempt to cover something like this up, because if - as is reasonably expected, they were eventually caught, they'd be finished. Conversely, if they explain that in the given circumstance they were forced to fire before comfirmation, then it's a tragedy, but that's the fog of war.

If you're trying to contrive a situation when they acted unnecessarily prematurely, then this is just an exercise in speculative character assassination.

I've a better one: if Cheney sexually interfered with a basking shark, would he lie about it to his children?
 
 
 
What does it matter if there was already a shoot down order?

 

To summarize the argument so far:

LastChild: If there were a shoot down order, the pilots would have fired at Delta 1989 as soon as they could.
Me: No pilot would shoot down a plane under those circumstances without getting visual confirmation.
LastChild: They would if they didn't have time.
Me: It would only take 41 seconds.
LastChild: It doesn't matter how little time it would take because there would already be a shoot down order.
Me: I could shoot myself, die and my corpse could emit gasses that would still make more sense than your argument.

Petend Debunker: duuuu errrrr under the circumstances in my pretend debunking it would only take 41 seconds. duuuhhhhh drooooll...

 
LastChild: 41 seconds to confirm it was a passenger jet? Then what? Have passenger jets never been shot out of the sky or nearly shot out of the sky by military jets? Why didn't they take the 41 seconds to confirm whatever it is you are claiming they could have confirmed?

LastChild: How does one get visual confirmation that an airliner is hijacked? Do they fly along side, tap on the window, and ask?

 
No, because the hijackers may not understand English.

Usually the military jet will have like a smoker feature, like the Wicked Witch when she spelled out "Surrender Dorothy" (wasn't that awesome?). And they'll paint out with the smoke a big ole Question Mark, since all cultures on this planet, and others, recognize that to mean: WTF?

The hijackers (and as we all know, hijackers love American football) get the six of themselves together, take off their shirts, paint a letter on their hijacker guts and then stand at the windows to spell out:

H I J A C K

And then of course the plane is shot down and covered up and escorted to a remote airstrip on a Pacific atoll.
 
 
 
The problem is that exercises do not consist of shooting down real-world Boeing 7x7s with Delta/United markings. Therefore, the pilots and ground personnel in question would realise that it was not an exercise (especially when they would have been told as much beforehand); for one thing, you simply cannot tell pilots, etc. that the missiles that they just fired and the commercial airliners that they just saw fall out of the sky were all in their minds. Therefore, it is implausible in the extreme to think that they could be convinced that they had just taken part in an exercise so routine as to not be worth talking about, especially if it took place on September 11th 2001.

 

 
If they shot down the plane over land you don't know that they got that close before they fired. How close do they have to be to shoot down a passenger jet? What if it's just the wrong United or wrong American plane? Do they have to be close enough to see all the markings? Maybe they are ordered to shoot as soon as they have a visual.

 

Even in the practically inexplicable event that the pilots had never got close enough to visually identify the plane, they and the involved ground personnel would still have known that they were not taking part in an exercise.
They would have been told as much beforehand, probably repeatedly. They would have fired real missiles at a real target that they took to be Delta 1989. That target would have had the transponder signal of Delta 1989. They would have seen what they took to be Delta 1989 break up on primary radar. They would later learn that the real Delta 1989 had crashed, and in the same place and at the same time as they had fired their missiles. In light of any one of the above, it is implausible in the extreme to think that they could be convinced that they had just taken part in an exercise so routine as to not be worth talking about. (Incidentally, I’ve listed only the factors that would come to bear before, during or in the first hour or so after their mission. There would be many more after that point.)

When I speak of the official story I 'm generally talking about things like the 9/11 commission and the whole 19 hijackers and box-cutters sound bite version. In mine and many others opinion the 9/11 commission report is nothing more then one more dubya administration attempted at obstruction and cover-up. I also don't think the 9/11 attacks were fabrications in that they defiantly happened and people are really dead. The fabrication is by those who would claim to know what happened based on any incomplete half-assed official inquiry thus far.

Thats why none of you so-called debunkers ever really attempt to support this official version or back it up. You would much rather have some one guess at what happened that day and try to pick their guess apart in a vain attempt to validate the inadequacies of the official line.

So I threw you a bone and all I get as far as debunking goes is lame excuses, bare assertions, and apologies for people who dont deserve it. This is the debunking fallacy. Pretending to debunk one persons opinion about 9/11 doesnt validate the official theory you obviously have blind faith in and nothing more.

Going around and around on this one thread I started on one aspect of the 9/11 attacks proves at least one thing. You and everyone else here are guessing, hoping, asserting, and grasping at straws, with your so-called debunking because thats all you have.

You dont know what happen because there has been no complete investigation.

I gave you three different scenarios they weren't combinations. In the end it's obvious that given the events of the day and given the history of military jets shooting down passenger jets the overall scenario of a military jet shooting down the wrong plane on 9/11 is very possible. And given the history of this administration and how they respond to past screw-ups or getting caught at criminal behavior a cover-up of this possible errant shoot-down would very be likely.

That's really about as much as a scenario I need to provide. You want to debunk it? Get a real investigation.

Or keep guessing and grasping at straws.

Why do you persist in thinking that the 9/11 commission was the investigation?

It has been pointed out to you lots of times that the investigation was done by various law enforcement agencies like the FBI and various police forces. Should we disregard every other investigation ever done by those people?

When the FBI arrest drug smugglers or child pornographers or whatever should we automatically assume that it is some kind of sham and that the real perps are getting away scott free?

41 seconds to confirm it was a passenger jet? Then what? Have passenger jets never been shot out of the sky or nearly shot out of the sky by military jets? Why didn't they take the 41 seconds to confirm whatever it is you are claiming they could have confirmed?

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_Air_Flight_655 

 

Um... you do know that Iran Air 655 was shot down by a boat, right? Right?

 
In the end it's obvious that given the events of the day and given the history of military jets shooting down passenger jets the overall scenario of a military jet shooting down the wrong plane on 9/11 is very possible.

 

Actually, in the end it's obvious that the overall scenario is impossible. See, 9/11 already happened and exactly zero passenger jets were shot down by the military that day. So, one thing that we can definitively say about the events of that day are that they were the events of that day. Something that didn't happen that day cannot possibly be made to have happened.

And given the history of this administration and how they respond to past screw-ups or getting caught at criminal behavior a cover-up of this possible errant shoot-down would very be likely.

 

Remember, that isnt the argument with which I am taking issue.

The point I am making is that it is implausible in the extreme to think that the pilots and ground personnel involved in such an inadvertent shoot-down could be convinced that they had just taken part in an exercise so routine as to not be worth talking about.
 
 
 
That's really about as much as a scenario I need to provide. You want to debunk it? Get a real investigation.

 

Id be interested to know what you believe debunking to be. Perhaps I could start a thread and you could contribute to it?
 
 
 
Um... you do know that Iran Air 655 was shot down by a boat, right? Right?

 
Yes and I gave you more then one example. The example you are speaking of was given to me in this very thread by a debunker. How does this help your position on the military visually confirming things before they shoot missiles at it? Did they shoot down a plane in error or not? Did you also forget the planes over the Atlantic sending out distress calls on 9/11 that I sourced?

Now I gave you examples of passenger jets being shot down in error. It proves they dont always confirm things. Now in some of the scenarios I originally provided its a passenger jet they would be looking to shoot-down. So just shooting down a passenger jet wouldnt be incorrect. It would only be an error if it was the wrong passenger jet.

 
Actually, in the end it's obvious that the overall scenario is impossible. See, 9/11 already happened and exactly zero passenger jets were shot down by the military that day. So, one thing that we can definitively say about the events of that day are that they were the events of that day. Something that didn't happen that day cannot possibly be made to have happened.

 
You don't even have one definitive thing you can claim about 9/11 based on any official version to date. You don't know what happened. Therefore you can't debunk anything.

Proving something wrong not implying why it might be wrong.
 
 
 
I understand your opinion on this issue. Thats fine. Unfortunately, however, none of the above has any bearing on the point I was making: None of us accept that the official story of the 9/11 attacks is merely an attempt at obstruction and cover-up. It most cases, this disagreement represents the very kernel of the controversy between truthers and debunkers. Consequently, employing said notion as a premise is a perfectly illegitimate move: It commits the begging the question fallacy.

If you would like some further information on this fallacy, then you might want to read over the following summary:  http://www.fallacyfiles.org/begquest.html 

 
Then you were wrong to participate in a thread that poses a theory that relies on the Administration being prone to cover things up. Many of us accept that the official story of the 9/11 attacks is merely an attempt at obstruction and cover-up" but that doesn't stop debunkers from pointing to official investigation as proof of something they are pretending to debunk.

You have no evidence for a cover up. Until you get some, I'd suggest that you refrain from idle libellous speculation. But then, you'd have nothing to do, would you LC?
 
 
 
Id be interested to know what you believe debunking to be.

Well, take Creationism for example: It is theory which has no evidence in its favour; there is overwhelming evidence in favour of a competing theory; it is an inherently implausible theory; its an epistemologically inelegant theory, in that it raises more questions than it answers. Despite all this, however, it is not a theory that has been proven wrong.

So, presumably you must consider Creationism not to have been debunked. Is that a fair assessment of your view?
 
 
 
The Bush administration being a bunch of chicken hawk war mongering crooks is not a fantasy.

 

In reality, that is precisely what it is.

 
You mean this one?

 

Yes, one of the many questions you refuse to answer.

 
Shriek? No. I would be stunned into silence at the witnessing of Dubya telling the truth or admitting a mistake on anything.

 

We notice that you made no effort to address the question. You never do.
 
 
 
I answered the administration. Anyone who is been caught lying as many times as them isn't worth the faith, excuses, and apologies people here try to pass off as debunking.

 

Perhaps you could provide ONE unambiguous example of a lie "they" have been caught telling? No? Trust me, absolutely no one thought you could.
 
 
 
Were there other civilian planes other then Iran Air Flight 655 that day that went down under different circumstances that it could have been added to?

 

Exactly how common do you imagine such occurrences to be?

 
It's not the same. Besides did the US ever fully admit responsibility? Eight years after the fact...

In 1996, the United States and Iran reached "an agreement in full and final settlement of all disputes, differences, claims, counterclaims" relating to the incident at the International Court of Justice. As part of the settlement, the United States agreed to pay $61.8 million in compensation for the Iranians killed. The United States did not admit responsibility or apologize to the Iranian government.

 

Equivocation. By "fully admit responsibility" you are implying that the US left some doubt as to whether the Vincennes shot down the Airbus, when the article's use of "admit responsibility" means "take the blame."
 
 
 
hen I speak of the official story I 'm generally talking about things like the 9/11 commission and the whole 19 hijackers and box-cutters sound bite version. In mine and many others opinion the 9/11 commission report is nothing more then one more dubya administration attempted at obstruction and cover-up. I also don't think the 9/11 attacks were fabrications in that they defiantly happened and people are really dead. The fabrication is by those who would claim to know what happened based on any incomplete half-assed official inquiry thus far.

 

Originally, you tried pretending to adults who are vaster smarter and more knowledgeable than you that the 9/11 Commission conducted the investigation that identified the hijackers. You were exposed. Now you are trying to pretend that the 9/11 Commission, criticized by conservatives as a politicized effort to whitewash Clinton and place all the blame on Bush, was an attempted cover-up by Bush. You seem to miss the big picture. Bush's rabid detractors in the Democratic Party will do almost anything to smear him. But--see if this will sink in--even they do not think that he perpetrated the attacks of 9/11. I realize that you can't possibly hope to grasp this point, but as bad as the Democrats on the commission wanted to make Bush appear, they don't swallow your evil movement's crapola about a gigantic, mathematically-impossible conspiracy. They really don't.

 
Thats why none of you so-called debunkers ever really attempt to support this official version or back it up. You would much rather have some one guess at what happened that day and try to pick their guess apart in a vain attempt to validate the inadequacies of the official line.

 

Come out of your dreamworld, Child. Your persona of the cocky, sneering brat who knows absolutely nothing is about as unattractive as it gets. You have been buried under a mountain of evidence. Your all-purpose response is to to stick your fingers in your ears and squeal loudly. You have never come close to offering anything that shakes the mainstream account. Come to think of it, you don't ever offer anything at all. You are conspicuously incapable of showing any inconsistencies or anomalies in the narrative produced by serious researchers. All of your uninformed slanders of innocent people and your outright lies have been shot down.

 
So I threw you a bone and all I get as far as debunking goes is lame excuses, bare assertions, and apologies for people who dont deserve it. This is the debunking fallacy. Pretending to debunk one persons opinion about 9/11 doesnt validate the official theory you obviously have blind faith in and nothing more.

Going around and around on this one thread I started on one aspect of the 9/11 attacks proves at least one thing. You and everyone else here are guessing, hoping, asserting, and grasping at straws, with your so-called debunking because thats all you have.

You dont know what happen because there has been no complete investigation.

 

Stop lying. The massive multi-agency investigation was as complete as any such undertaking could hope to be.

You don't even have one definitive thing you can claim about 9/11 based on any official version to date. You don't know what happened. Therefore you can't debunk anything.

 

Here's one off the top of my head: We know that AA Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon, killing everyone on board. We know this because the plane was tracked into the Washington, D.C. area, debris from it was found inside the Pentagon, and the remains of the passengers and crew were identified by DNA testing at the Dover Port Mortuary. We notice that you run away whenever you are nailed to the wall with inconvenient facts.

What?
 
 
 
Yeah but we are talking about people who have a motto of "why tell the truth when we can lie and milk that lie for all it's worth?". Like Pat Tillman remember him? Was there a purpose to hiding what that was all about?

 

The people who tried to cover up the circumstances of Pat Tillman's death and who bungled the initial investigations were all Army officers, and most likely attempting to cover their own or other soldiers' [rule10]s. You'd know this if you'd bothered to research the issue at all, instead of just mindlessly bashing the Bush administration.

 
They like to lie and rub your nose in it and they like it even more when they know that you know they are lying and can't do anything about it. They're creating their own reality because they are an empire now and well.. they can and you can't. ha ha

 

 
 
 
 
Boston did lose contact with flight 1989 when they failed to respond. Who is to say how lont the powers that be would wait to find out id it was hijacked. Are they going to wait for it to crash into another building?

 

The only reason Boston Center "lost contact" with Delta 1989 was that the aircraft was already talking to Cleveland Center. If fighters had attempted to intercept the aircraft, do you know how they would have found it? They would have been vectored onto their target by air-traffic controllers from Cleveland Center, who would also have been talking to the airliner. Please explain how Delta 1989 gets shot down in those circumstances, other than by some incredibly unlikely coincidence such as a radio failure.

 
No.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_A...es_Flight_1989 

A Cleveland controller thought he heard "Get out of here" and "We have a bomb on board" coming from Delta 1989. The Delta pilot denied any cockpit intrusion and stated that everyone on board was fine. It was later confirmed that that mysterious transmission had come from United Flight 93 which was in the same vicinity as 1989

Sounds like they had it mixed up with another flight even thought the transponder on 1989 was functioning. How did that happen?

 

The controllers did not have Delta 1989 "mixed up" with United 93. All aircraft talking to the same controller are sharing the same radio frequency; without a call sign, the controller had no way of knowing which aircraft transmitted the hijack messages.

What is the point of this thread?

 
My guess is that LastChild is trying to get us to admit that the military could shoot down an innocent jetliner by mistake and if it did would cover it up. Then LastChild would try to convince us that this is what happened to United 93.

How this would prove the WTC was imploded is beyond me.

Right...

I'd tend to think it's certainly possible that the military could somehow accidentally shoot an airliner down, however unlikely, and I might even accept that they might try to cover it up, however I suspect the truth would come out in a matter of hours if not days.

Of course all of this is academic since UA93 was not shot down.

(And what does any of this have to do with Delta Airlines Flight 1989?)
 
 
American patriot battery shoot down a UK Tornado bomber and the NWO cannot cover it up.

I concur. Keeping something this big secret is just impossible unless....... Bush himself was the pilot of the jet that fired the missile and Cheney was manning the radar and Rumsfeld disposed of everyone at the air base with a bad batch of anthrax vaccine.....then... maybe it could work.

 
Of course all of this is academic since UA93 was not shot down.

 
Of course, it takes someone below the level of idiot to think otherwise.

 
(And what does any of this have to do with Delta Airlines Flight 1989?)

 
My guess is that LastChild thinks that identifying a plane as suspicious for a brief time is the same as outright declaring it hijacked and powering up AA batteries to blot it out of the sky.

Which leads me to wonder exactly how many AA bateries there were in the Cleaveland area on 9/11,

Oh yeah, didn't you know, according to Truthers there are Patriot Missile batteries everywhere, the Pentagon, Indian Lake and.... surely in Cleveland too.

Hed have good reason to.

Most of my time with the New World Order has been great fun; Ive enjoyed the job. The only real difficulty Ive had was trying to haul a basking shark up the Thames for Jack Ashley. It didn't really work out; it died after about three days of being tethered to the terrace. Jack was quite unpopular after that, for a while.

Yeah but Indian Lake never caught on fire like our Cuyahoga River did. And if that could happen, then maybe the twoofers are corr... sorry, the cognac bottle was empty and I'm typing this while the flow is interrupted by opening a new one.

Cleveland Rocks!!!
 
 
The area downtown by the Cuyahoga is pretty nice these days isn't it?
 
 
 
No, because the hijackers may not understand English.

Usually the military jet will have like a smoker feature, like the Wicked Witch when she spelled out "Surrender Dorothy" (wasn't that awesome?). And they'll paint out with the smoke a big ole Question Mark, since all cultures on this planet, and others, recognize that to mean: WTF?

The hijackers (and as we all know, hijackers love American football) get the six of themselves together, take off their shirts, paint a letter on their hijacker guts and then stand at the windows to spell out:

H I J A C K

And then of course the plane is shot down and covered up and escorted to a remote airstrip on a Pacific atoll.

 

     

I laughed so hard at that post that my assistant came into my office to see what the heck was going on.

(Note to self: close office door before popping in here next time.)
 
 
 
Even the military personnel shooting down the planes could still think they were hijacked or part of a drill over the Atlantic unrelated to 9/11.

 

 
[The pilots and ground personnel who had shot down the plane] wouldn't need to be told anything more then what you are told and believe. How many questions are you asking?

 

For the sake of clarity, Ill summarise the problems I have highlighted with the above as they apply to, and in the context of, each of your three scenarios.

 
If they shot down the plane over land you don't know that they got that close before they fired. How close do they have to be to shoot down a passenger jet? What if it's just the wrong United or wrong American plane? Do they have to be close enough to see all the markings? Maybe they are ordered to shoot as soon as they have a visual. Now I've seen plenty of footage of the planes that hit the towers but I don't see any markings on any of them telling me for sure what airline they are from never mind exactly what plane they are. That's even when you slow it up and zoom in.

 

Even in the practically inexplicable event that the pilots had never got close enough to visually identify the plane, they and the involved ground personnel would still have known that they were not taking part in an exercise.
They would have been told as much beforehand, probably repeatedly. They would have fired real missiles at a real target that they took to be Delta 1989. That target would have had the transponder signal of Delta 1989. They would have seen what they took to be Delta 1989 break up on primary radar. They would later learn that the real Delta 1989 had crashed, and in the same place and at the same time as they had fired their missiles. In light of any one of the above, it is implausible in the extreme to think that they could be convinced that they had just taken part in an exercise so routine as to not be worth talking about. (Incidentally, Ive listed only the factors that would come to bear before, during or in the first hour or so after their mission. There would be many more after that point.)

Further, if the plane hadnt actually been hijacked, then its transponder would never have been switched off, and air traffic control would have never lost track of it. Consequently, they would have witnessed it going out over the Atlantic and/or simply breaking up at the genuine crash-site. This event would have also been captured on their radar tapes.

 
Now the scenario over the Atlantic is that the plane is hijacked or thought to be and escorted or lost over the Atlantic. You can't very well escort the plane back over land so what do you do? Even if you have contact with the pilot how do you know the hijacker doesn't have a knife to his throat telling him what to say? You thought you heard a disturbance so now what? You also dont have any time because you have to respond to another out of 11 possible hijacked planes that day. So you get the order and the plane is shot down but you still don't know if it was hijacked for sure. You as the shoot-down pilot are going to question whatever story the powers that be decide on after the fact? Why?

 

Similarly, the pilots and ground personnel would still have known that they were not taking part in an exercise.
They would have been told as much beforehand, probably repeatedly. They would have fired real missiles at a real-world Boeing 767 with Delta markings that they took to be Delta 1989. They would have witnessed those missiles strike that plane. They would have witnessed that plane fall out of the sky. That plane would have had the transponder signal of Delta 1989. They would have seen what they took to be Delta 1989 break up on primary radar. They would later learn that the real Delta 1989 had crashed, and in the same place and at the same time as they had fired their missiles. In light of any one of the above, it is implausible in the extreme to think that they could be convinced that they had just taken part in an exercise so routine as to not be worth talking about. (Incidentally, Ive listed only the factors that would come to bear before, during or in the first hour or so after their mission. There would be many more after that point.)

Further, if the plane hadnt actually been hijacked, then its transponder would never have been switched off, and air traffic control would have never lost track of it. Consequently, they would have witnessed it going out over the Atlantic and/or simply breaking up at the genuine crash-site. This event would have also been captured on their radar tapes.

 
And finally what if you are a pilot and you get up in the morning to participate in a drill were you shoot down what you are told is a drone over the Atlantic from a distance. You do it and afterwards are told your drill and the 9/11 attacks are two different things that didn't have anything to do with each other. Other then because you were performing this drill you couldn't get back to protect the states in time. You're going to question it? Based on what information?

 

If the cover-up had already gone into play even before the mission had taken place, then the shoot-down cannot have accidental. In light of this, we can see that the above is inherently incompatible with an accidental shoot-down cover-up scenario.

Thank you much LL (and the other LL too). It's the risk of being a wiseass on the innernetz instead of in the kindergarten classroom (where I got started). You never really know if you've landed a good one, so you fly without a net most times. This time I knew, and appreciate!

Yep Travis, I think it still is, although haven't been back in awhile. Cleveland did its big boost and growth a bit ago - an astounding transformation - but it always comes down to jobs. They are being lost. I believe the city and surrounding burbs is now considered a negative-growth region. Lack of jobs will cripple a great city and the population starts to empty out.
