 
 
Castro Retires....
 
 
Last night it emerged that Fidel Casto has announced that he will retire (relinquishing both his civil and military titles) in the Cuban State newspaper, Granma. How will this affect the reception of Cuba in the world? Will the newly elected Parliament, set to sit on Sunday, encourage the US to consider its long embargo on Cuban trade and goods? However, he will remain a member of Parliament -will he continue to overshadow Cuban decisions in the future (including the "expected" election of Raul -his brother- as President?).

Since I posted in the GD thread I'll keep this brief and much as it was their.

Perhaps people can stop condemning Cuba and get on with letting it develop of its own accord and according to the will of its people, instead of obsessing over communism like some deranged dog that's been left out in the cold too long.

One can but dream.

The only thing wrong with Cuba is the pay of pigs facility for the criminally ambiguous non-combatants.

I do not disagree with you; geopolitical anxiety about the 'ghost' of Communism in Cuba has become increasingly desultory. For all of the criticisms of the Communist Government in Cuba (economic disparity; poverty; shortage of resources), these can equally be applied by the counterfactual argument that, "without the embargo, Cuba would flourish".

Concerning the Bay of Pigs (Guantanamo) 'institution', I do not see that a new President or a new National Assembly will alter the contractual reality that it represents -if the disbanding of Guantanamo was as easy as a public declaration it certainly would have happened before.

Well since Cuba hasn't been without embargo for any real length of time with have no idea what would happen. I say leave them to their own devices and stop obsessing over their constitution, if they want communism let them have it, if they want another form of government let the decide that for themselves.

I'm not debating its location, I'm questioning its dubious morality in holding hundreds of people without trial, and using dubious methods of interrogation that are torture by any other name.

Cuba's ailing leader Fidel Castro has said he will not accept another term as president, ending 49 years in power.

"I neither will aspire to, nor will I accept, the position of president of the council of state and commander in chief," he told the newspaper, Granma.

Well it was gonna happen is health and the rumours of him being alive etc surfacing all the time contributed to his decision to retire.

End of an era...what do you guys make of it?
 
 
um, isnt there already a thread on this?
 
 
While anti-American gringos might want to keep the Cuban people under Communism, it certainly isn't what the majority of them want. I wish Fidel a speedy decline in health and hope that Ra√∫l has the commonsense to open up the country to democracy.
 
 
Well I think Cuba has done extremely well considering all the sanctions on it. Although I think democracy should be put it place there, I think the communism rule has worked reasonably well resulting in world class health (free to all - better than america can do) and education.

What I don't understand is how people can be so hostile towards Cuba yet so lax against China, even though it is arguably more brutal and on a much larger scale than Cuba. (Actually, I do - money...)
 
 
FYI they are able to offer universal healthcare because they pay their doctors peanuts.

Same with their education system.

They aren't, though, emigration is illegal and if it wasn't Cuba probably wouldn't be able to run much at all.

So is there a bar on teachers and doctors leaving the country? If there is, then you have a point.

If there isnt, they obviously dont mind that much.

I assume people know the amount they would get paid before they started training or are they also forced to do whatever training they are told to do?

No one can leave the country. Without express permission, and whenever Cuba goes abroad to compete in sport half the team try to defect..

What they pay their doctors is of absoloutly no concern to me. Obviously the doctors are able to survive on it and continue to do their chosen occupation.

Ah, I didnt know that. I was under the impression that you were free to leave but most of your property would be taken off you.

That still doesnt change the fact that those people arent forced to become doctors and teachers.

Also, from what I have seen (admittedly not a huge amount) on the news, documentaries etc. the quality of life is quite high.
 
 
I have a dreadful feeling that Carlos Lage is going to get the Presidency after an interim period and proceed along the neoliberal road taken by much of Eastern Europe and Latin America. A lot of this will depend on US response: Cuba relies on aid from Venezuela to cover the cost of the embargo, so if it were to take up the example of the Chavistas, it would probably be a positive step forward.

That said, i don't think much will change with regards to the US. Probably the only change will be that the CIA has to target someone else for assasination instead. The Presidential candidates have to ramp up the anti-Castro rhetoric to secure Floridan delegates.

What should happen (though seems unlikely), in my view, is a gradual internal process of change that moves towards genuinely democratic elections, but also decentralises the economy along the lines of market socialism, so that there is economic as well as political democracy. The strong record Cuba has on welfare and living standards should be preserved and strengthened, and the US should lift the embargo in exchange for democratic elections there.

What's more likely is that radical free-market reforms are introduced, unemployment/mortality rates/life expectancy/access to high-quality public education slide, asset-stripping runs wild, inequality soars and civil liberties are curbed even further to clamp down on protesters against cuts imposed by the IMF and WTO. But hey, i am an optimist  
 
 
why is sky news showing the headline that he is dead?

Ha.
 
 
I've literally just founnd this out, and booked 2 weeks in Cuba for Easter. I hate that everything will slowly change, i loved the whole time-warp feel to the place. The embargo has no place anymore, and should end. When exactly is he retiring?
 
 
maybe the homosexuals of cuba will get a break at last
 
 
Because it is owned by Rupert Murdoch.

Yes, if only we could keep the Cuban people under a repressive regime and halt progress so that a few gringos can go and admire outdated cadillacs and pay Cuban girls for sex.

That would be a grand shame as Cuba truly has led Latin America in terms of women's rights, education and life expectancy. In all honesty though, can Cuba's unemployment problem deteriorate any more? Thousands of young professionals already leave Cuba each year because there's simply no work going in their homeland.

It may seem insane, but I do feel that Castro may be dead, it would be very easy for Raul Castro to pen a newspaper insert detailing 'Fidel's' wishes...But, let's leave that for the ''Cuban Conspiracy Thread''

I'm not a gringo, and as i'm part Venezuelan, with family there, i have a certain affinity with the lefty Hispanic governments- i know my family have benefited in the past. And part of the reason that so many have poor quality of life is because of the embargo that needs to end asap. Let's not just blame Castro, wh has done a lot of bad- but a whole lotta good too.

And paying Cuban girls for sex? I don't have to entertain the thought of ever paying for sex, but wouldn't on principle. Urgh.
 
 
Yes, let's not blame Castro for turning 'his' country into a prison, imprisoning and killing opposition and others for the 'bourgeois' crime of homosexuality. Let us all praise him for taking a country where some were rich and some were poor and turning it into a country where all are poor and miserable. I recognise the fact that the Cuban education system is good which is certainly one benefit that is common to Communist regimes, including in the USSR, but in a country like Cuba it doesn't really count for much when you are a doctor when you are paid peanuts. Cuba would not have any doctors if emigration wasn't illegal, and so no universal healthcare.

Abajo Fidel, **** that left-wing Pinochet.

I imagine the training for Doctors is standardised in any country using 'Western' medicine. I argue this from the knowledge that students from America regularly train in Cuban Universities due to the lower tuition fees (the ELAM scheme) -yet they return to the U.S. to practice. This must mean that a Cuban medical degree is accredited in the United States.

There isn't a ban on Doctors leaving the country at all -a large proportion of Cuban doctors serve abroad, as well as reacting to international crises (Hurricane George in 1998, for example) by 'exporting' medical aid. They also have large education programmes that operate, mainly, in Latin America.

There is a difference between Cuban government directed aid through their doctors, which is of course easy to pay for when you are paying your doctors practically nothing, and legal emigration. Still, like when Cuban sportsmen go abroad, doctors too are keen to defect to la libertad del capitalismo.

(02-25) 04:00 PST Bogota, Colombia -- Ariel Perez was, like thousands of fellow Cuban doctors, a devoted soldier in Fidel Castro's most important overseas mission -- providing medical care to the poor in oil-rich Venezuela, Cuba's most vital ally. But last year, Perez and two Cuban companions, carrying rucksacks with a few belongings and holding just $1,300 among them, sneaked across the Colombian border and promptly defected.

"From the moment I got there, I thought of it -- leaving," Perez, 36, said in an interview in Bogota, where about 40 Cuban physicians and other medical professionals are living after fleeing from Venezuela.

Now, Perez and the other Cuban defectors are providing a rare inside look at a program that has helped define the close relationship between Washington's two most formidable adversaries in the Americas, the 48-year-old communist government in Cuba and the populist administration of President Hugo Chavez in Venezuela.

Firstly, nowhere does it state their clear intentions or motivations to leave - "thinking" of leaving does not encompass why they left, when perhaps their reasons were entirely personal. I am not suggesting for a moment that the Cuban regime has not conducted itself in a highly questionable manner at times (in relation to homosexuals and the supression of political rivals), yet I do hesitate when criticising a state that has fared, comparatively, very well under a long economic embargo. The Cuban medical and educational achievements are a paragon for the rest of the world, even if their domestic politics are not.
 
 
The US should invade and free the people from Bolshevik tyranny and open up Cuba to the delights of Western laissez faire market democracy.

The thing is that you could say the same about Mussolini. What awful things he did to those poor communists and the like, but how wonderful our industrial development is and at least the trains are running on time! Same with Hitler and the autobahn. Stalin and the astoundingly rapid and costly (to human lives) industialisation of the Soviet Union. It is easy to be able to do at least something right when you have absolute control over your country and can execute or imprison whoever you like whenever you like. I put Castro on the same level as the previously mentioned tyrants, fascinating in a history book but I don't want him in a government in any country I'm in.

I don't agree with the US embargo, it is now a relic of the cold war, and I think that in the interests of opening up Cuba first economically and then politically the US should consider dropping it now that a, hopefully, more pragmatic man is now el comandante en jefe providing that he is actually willing to reform. I suppose the potential success of that will depend on who is going to be the next president of the US, McCain fought in Vietnam and is a staunch communist who recently said that he'd been tortured by Cubans while in North Vietnamese captivity, Fidel later called him a liar so make of that what you will. I believe that Barack Obama is more left leaning, and in my opinion naive which sure won't get him any votes in Florida, on the question of Cuba. Hillary Clinton wants to link policy on Cuba to changes in the Cuban regime.
