Carlos Tevez, who has rejected an offer to stay with Manchester United, is considering offers from three clubs -- Manchester City, Chelsea and one his adviser declined to name.

"Right now we are evaluating the proposals from City, Chelsea and one other team," his adviser Kia Joorabchian said in an interview on Radio Del Plata on Wednesday.

Joorabchian said a decision would be made in the next 10 days, after he sits down with Tevez and his agent, Adrian Ruocco.

Last Saturday, Tevez turned down a $41 million, five-year offer from United that would have made his two-year loan deal permanent.

He has already ruled out a move to Liverpool, because of its rivalry with United.

Joorabchian gave no indication of which way the Argentina striker was leaning.
