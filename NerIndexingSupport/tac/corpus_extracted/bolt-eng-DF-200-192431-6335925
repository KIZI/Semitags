Which celeb do you:
Love ? Why? Hate? Why?

--------------------

For me
Love ? Why? many but what come to mind is Cate Blanchett - fantastic actress who doesn't flaunt her life to the media. Jesse McCartney   Hate? Why? Paris Hilton - people think she is sexy????     I wouldn't see those sex tapes for free.
 
 
Love - Derren Brown, you can tell he works extremely hard and very smart. A perfect dinner guest. Also, Stephen Fry - he's gorge!  

Hate - Naomi Campbell, what a spoilt beewatch.
 
 
Well I don't 'hate' any celebrity, but there are some I am not very fond of, e.g. Paris Hilton. She represents the decay of Western society.

Celebrities I 'love' (lol) - Whoopi Goldberg (humour), Meryl Streep (stunning talent and elegence), Al Pacino (same reasons).
 
 
I find Katie Price to be an extremely powerful woman, particularly in her personal life. She does a lot, very much like Pricness Diana did, to regulate the amount of media exposure her children get (by this, I mean that it's done on her terms, not theirs). I also have a great amount of respect for Sharon Osbourne.

I hate Kerry Katona. She gets on my bloody nerves.
 
 
Hate...Tom cruise...using his status for trying to put an imprint onto history..and dragging travolta down.

love..cenk ugar...some turkish dude...has a show on YouTube..called the youngturks...the guy is brilliantly down to earth and his humor is spot on..what he deos the best though is make you understand polotics on his ground.

p.s.
the the disturbing girl above me..pls dont compare Katie Price A>K>A Jordan to Princess Diana....for obvious reasons.

I feel my reasons are justified. I'm not comparing them side by side, but their attitudes towards the media in their children's lives are reasonably similar.

I am thinking of Jordon - the model and Diana - the Princess?
I think they are different. Jordon is about publicity and therefore has a choice whereas Diana, I get the impression, didn't really have a choice.
 
 
Love (well like) : Anyone from desperate housewives lol, Richard Branson (inspirational), Jeremy Clarkson (he could sort the world out)
Hate: Mariah Carey, Naomi Campbell, Robbie Williams, Pauline from Eastenders

Lol Ok, If I take Robbie out then thats definately a combination of good arrogant people. Robbie just has a big ego  
 
 
Well, I love Milla Jovovich, and Fiona Fagan  

I don't like Jade Goody or what ever her name is. She gets on my nerves.
 
 
Like: Johnny Depp (protects his family from the spotlight), Piers Morgan (doesn't take anything too seriously and acts like an arse   )

Hate: Princess Diana (oh, she's dead, but she's in the newspapers all the time so she counts!), Kerry Katona, Amy Winehouse, Madonna

MADONNA    

 

I do hate Diana because she was a scheming, nasty woman who used charities as a front for her own evil gains  

I don't like Madonna because she puts on a fake "British" accent, is very rude and uses sharpened spurs on horses.
