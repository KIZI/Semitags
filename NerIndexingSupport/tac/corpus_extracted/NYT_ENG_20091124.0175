San Francisco -- Cirrus the wonder pigeon will fly across the
country early next week on his way back to his home in a suburb of
Wichita, Kan. This time he'll take the plane.

His flight inside a special U.S. Postal Service mailing package
will be the last chapter of a saga that took the bird from his
pigeon loft in Kansas to a patio deck in Point Richmond on the
shores of San Francisco Bay. His trip covered 1,700 miles and took
more than four years.

Maybe he flew here, but no one knows for sure.

"It is absolutely amazing," said Olene Sparks, who discovered
the pigeon on her deck on a cloudy afternoon last week.

She could tell this was no ordinary pigeon. For one thing, he
was almost pure white, with a few gray marks. Most pigeons around
here are muddy gray.

For another, the bird had an aura about him.

"He wouldn't leave," Sparks said. "He kept wanting to come
into the house. I could see that he was a sweet bird, a nice
bird."

Sparks is fond of animals, especially cats. But her cats are too
timid to approach a pigeon with personality, so she brought the
bird inside and took him under her wing. She knew neighbors who
were fond of birds. Alma Wainscott, who has parrots and cockatoos,
lent a large birdcage. Kevin McMullin knew about pigeons from his
experience in rescuing a couple of orphaned pigeon chicks.

Wainscott and Sparks named the bird Cirrus.

"He came out of a cloud, and he's white," said Sparks. "So it
fits."

As it turned out, Sparks was right: Cirrus is no wandering
street pigeon; he is a thoroughbred and his trip West was an
odyssey.

Sparks and her neighbors noticed that the wayward pigeon had a
blue band on his right leg. It said WICHITA KS and had a serial
number. There's no place to hide in the Internet age, even for
pigeons, which can live up to 15 years. An Internet search led the
pigeon detectives to the Wichita Friendly Pigeon Flyers Club. The
serial number led to Chuck Miller, who works in the aircraft
industry, lives in the Wichita suburb of Haysville and is a pigeon
racer.

"I remembered that bird, of all the birds I have," he said in
a telephone interview. He has about 100 birds, 50 racers and 50
breeders.

Miller said he bought the bird at auction for $150. He had good
bloodlines -- the father was a champion from the noted World of
Wings loft in Oklahoma City; the mother was from pigeons owned by
Leo Claussen, a noted Belgian pigeon racer.

Pigeon racing is one of the world's oldest sports, and homing
pigeons, once used to carry wartime messages, can travel long
distances. Miller's racing birds have flown over 500 miles in 12
hours, the time registered by computer chips attached to a leg.

"You know racing homers are like thoroughbred race horses,"
Miller said. "The better the bloodlines, the better they race."

Miller thought Cirrus might be a winner too -- until he flew the
coop.

"Well about four years ago, I guess, when I was trying to
settle him"-- a pigeon racing term for getting the pigeon to
return to its home loft -- "I let him out and sometimes, when they
get outside they just go," Miller said ruefully. "He just kept
going."

Nobody can say why or where the bird went. At some point, he
must have realized he wasn't in Kansas anymore and lost his
bearings or upset his homing instinct. It might be that the bird
was picked up by another pigeon racer, taken to California and
released. Or maybe he flew from loft to loft. Or maybe, he flew all
the way to California, over the Midwest, over the Rockies, over the
desert, over the Sierra Nevada. About 1,700 miles as the crow
flies.

"Can you imagine the things he's seen?" said Miller.

      The bird isn't talking. He's no stool pigeon.

Cirrus spent only a few days in Point Richmond. Sparks located
Dave Canning, who belongs to the Fremont Pigeon Racing Club.
Canning had space in his loft in the East Bay and took the bird in.

"He was totally exhausted, and a little sick," Canning said,
"His spirit was low."

Canning gave Cirrus some medicine and put him in with a female
pigeon. "He's looking good now," Canning said.

Canning had planned to ship Cirrus back to Kansas on Tuesday, a
trip that takes two days by Postal Service. But the post office
advised him to wait because of the Thanksgiving holiday. The post
office is no place for a pigeon on turkey day.
