WASHINGTON  San Antonio area leaders said they received
assurances Tuesday that aerospace work conducted by private
contractors at Port San Antonio was not under threat by an Oklahoma
facility.

City and business leaders also were told that the construction
of a National Security Agency data center is ahead of schedule and
under budget, giving hope that its future expansion in the Alamo
City would be seen favorably.

Richard Perez, president of the Greater San Antonio Chamber of
Commerce, said he was optimistic even as NSA officials remained
guarded about any future expansion plans.

"If there is anywhere they are going to expand, it is San
Antonio, because it is going so well," he said.

Members of the San Antonio chamber and its sister organization,
the San Antonio Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, were in Washington
for their 32nd annual trip to lobby for federal funds for pet
projects.

More than 145 people participated in this year's pilgrimage -- a
record high number.

Mayor Julian Castro and Bexar County Judge Nelson Wolff
accompanied business leaders on a four-day swing through the
corridors of the Capitol, the Pentagon and other federal agencies.

San Antonio City Manager Sheryl Sculley and Tommy Adkisson, a
Bexar County commissioner, also helped spearhead lobbying efforts
for a variety of aerospace, biomedical, education and military
programs.

Port San Antonio officials have voiced concern that it could
lose some of its $4 billion a year aerospace industry activity if
the government moves more work from private contractors to public
maintenance depots like those at Tinker AFB in Oklahoma.

Tinker received federal funds last year to build an engine
facility that could compete with private contractors in San
Antonio.

But Pentagon officials assured San Antonio officials that the
new facility in Oklahoma won't threaten private workloads in the
Alamo City, said Wayne Alexander, Port San Antonio chairman.

"My paranoia level has dropped -- a little," Alexander said.

Meanwhile, San Antonio leaders pressed the Air Force to make its
cyber command headquarters fully operational as fast as possible
and argued for an expansion on top of that: a $37 million cyber
consortium that would link military, education and private
businesses, including classes on cyber security at St. Mary's
University and the University of Texas at San Antonio.

"We fought hard to get the cyber command in San Antonio. There
has been a ripple effect. It's going to continue to grow," said
Bill Mock, executive vice president for the Greater San Antonio
Chamberof Commerce.

City leaders also spoke with officials about the new ambulatory
hospital being built at Lackland AFB. President Obama's new budget
included $289 million to construct it.
