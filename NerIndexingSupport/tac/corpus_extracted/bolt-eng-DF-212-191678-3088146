Pentagon Sees 3 Options for Iraq: 'Go Big,' 'Go Long' and 'Go Home'
Monday, November 20, 2006

WASHINGTON Â— Senior Defense Department officials are mapping out a new strategy for Iraq defined by insiders as "go big," "go long" and "go home," according to a newspaper report.

Monday's edition of The Washington Post says a secret review commissioned by Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Gen. Peter Pace outlines three alternatives for Iraq: sending in more troops for a short-term blitz, shrinking the force on the ground but staying longer or ditching Iraq and pulling out.

An official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the newspaper that the group conducting the review is likely to recommend a combination of the first two options, but favors going long.

The study comes as violence in Iraq appears nowhere near abating. At home, voters made their opinion of the war known during a midterm election that ousted many Republicans who favor President Bush's position of pressing onward.

Democrats are split about what to do with the U.S. commitment in Iraq, but two in powerful positions next Congress are looking at timetables.

Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., the incoming chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said last week that he favors a plan to get out within four to six months.

In the absence of a phased withdrawal of U.S. troops, Levin told a cable news network that Iraqis are "going to continue to have the false assumption that we are there in some kind of an open-ended way. And it is that assumption on their part that takes them off the hook."

Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del., the incoming head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told NBC on Monday that he is waiting for recommendations from the Iraq Study Group, a congressionally-commissioned panel mandated with finding solutions.

Biden said he wants the panel to make clear that U.S. troops won't stay indefinitely, adding that the United States should begin to let Iraq's leaders know of that plan so they can address the issue of "how to get Iraqis to stand together."

Biden said he also hopes the group led by former Secretary of State James A. Baker III and former Democratic Rep. Lee Hamilton will propose a clear political road map for Iraq and recommend engaging Iraq's neighbors in a political and diplomatic solution.

"Over the next four months let them know we're going to start to phase out, force them to have to address the central issue. That is not how to stand up Iraqis, but how to get Iraqis to stand together," Biden said.

"The idea that we're going to have 140,000 troops in Iraq this time next year is just not reasonable," he said.

On Sunday, Republican Sen. John McCain, a Vietnam pilot and possible 2008 presidential candidate, said more troops should be sent in and that the soldiers there now are "fighting and dying for a failed policy."

"I believe the consequences of failure are catastrophic," said McCain. "It will spread to the region. You will see Iran more emboldened. Eventually, you could see Iran pose a greater threat to the state of Israel."

With about 141,000 U.S. troops in Iraq more than 3 1/2 years into the war, the American military has strained to provide enough forces while allowing for adequate rest and retraining between deployments.

Democratic Rep. Charles Rangel of New York repeated his call for reinstituting the military draft, which the administration has repeatedly said it doesn't need.

"there's no question in my mind that this president and this administration would never have invaded Iraq, especially on the flimsy evidence that was presented to the Congress, if indeed we had a draft," said Rangel, the incoming chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.

Talking on CBS' "Face the Nation," Rangel said he will introduce a bill next year requiring Americans to sign up for a new military draft after turning 18. He has said the all-volunteer military disproportionately puts the burden of war on minorities and lower-income families.

Go long and Go home are the same strategy. Go big achieves nothing. Who would the US "go big" against?

The Iraq issue is only divisive in the media. The issues are not close enough to home, nor the coalition death toll big enough to actually warrent the domestic population to panic. Yes, deaths are tragic. but the western populations are not sufficiently touched by Iraqi deaths to want more of their own dying to help. Going big would bring the spectre of conscription or a contraction of US and other forces deployment overseas. They are stretched as it is.

Shoving more troops in would cause the region to destablise more. It doesn't matter as to rights or wrongs, but the presence of western troops is a motivator for the insurgents. More western troops = more insurgents.

Go home can only be morally achieved by go long. Can't pull out and let it descend completely. If a withdrawal is defined in a short term timetable then you will get Somalia all over again - a situation where everyone is focussing on a somewhat meaningless date.

The solution is to continue to support Iraq as it evolves into a stable country. It is inevitable that this will involve talks with its neighbours. Iran and Syria have both overt and underground reasons for an interest in Iraq. The most transparent being that if Iraq descends into civil war it is unlikely to be confined within its borders.

The plan for withdrawal should be objective based, not time driven. When the milestones are achieved there will be a natural progression from an occupation force to a policing action to a supporting role to advisory. At each milestone coalition troops will become increasingly redundant and can be redeployed.

Also, by going long it provides troops on the ground which will be useful in the ongoing situation with Iran regardless of Iraq.
 
 
I want to see an Iraq campaign that's "bigger, longer, and uncut."  
 
 
Go big na dthen bigger.

1- Order and Security

Beatign an insurgency is doable, but brutal. Outlaw guns and weapons, shot on site type outlawing, Kill Sadr and when his people riot in the streets gun them down with apaches, use reprisals (they are legal if proportionate). Make the cost of coming after US troops so high they simply wont do it.

at the same time when you catch a corrupt cop acting as a death sqaud member kill him and hang his corpse in the sqaure of the town he was terrorising.

Make preaching radical islam or hate a crime punishable by death and then enforce it.

2- Stability

Turn the F'ing lights on already and ge tthe clean water running

3- Hope

stop uisng forgien contrators and put Iraqi men to work rebuilding thier own country. Paythenm a decent wage for thier sweat

Get the teachrs and university professors to come home and give them a state of the art university

Security

Tell Iran tha tthe gig is up and if the insurgency doesnt stop yesterday we are going to take them apart and knock them into the stone age and salt the earth and forever end Persia's ambitions at empire.
 
 
So when we've killed 10,000 Sadr-ites, what then? What do we do with the 100,000 that will pop up to take their place? What do we do with an entire city that hates us because we've killed their family and/or friends? Kill 'em all? Okay, then what do we do with an entire country that hates us because we just destroyed a city? There is a way to do COIN effectively and productively, and brutality is not that way.

Reprisals when American soldiers are attacked simply are not worth it. If you come to the table with the view that your soldiers' lives are worth far more than the civilians they are attempting to protect, you will get NOWHERE in trying to win hearts and minds. If we don't care about the citizens of the country we're trying to stabilize, WTF are we doing there in the first place?

Indeed, I voted go big, because, well, the primary reason the occupation has become such a travesty is because there havent been enough people on the ground, be they Iraqi, American, Australian, Korean or whatever, to control the country and provide enough security to allow services to re-establish themselves to the point that Iraqi civilians don't have to live in squalor and perpetual danger.
Probably the biggest error from an ecomonic standpoint was disbanding the Iraqi Regular Army, since the subsequent outpouring of disgruntled people who didn't mind helping the insurgency, or at least selling their weapons to them, has dragged this whole thing out way past it's bedtime, and simply put it would have been a lot cheaper and easier to reform the existing Army (although the guard had to go) rather than to build a new one from scratch, especially when its recruits are priority number one for the mainstream of the insurgency.
 
 
So when we've killed 10,000 Sadr-ites, what then? What do we do with the 100,000 that will pop up to take their place?

There wont be, if thier is killing to do, do it all up front with as much force as possible and shock the citizenry into compliance. it has worked every time it was tried in history. from Rome through the mongols, Ameriandians, the pre world war colonies upto post WW2 Germany, Japan and post civil war China. How do you think Saddam kept te country inline? By making the price of breaking the peace to hard to bear.

The differrance is you dont just kill to keep order, you use the order produced by the violence to create peace.

What do we do with an entire city that hates us because we've killed their family and/or friends?

rebuild it, just ask Berlin, Dresden, hamburg, Nagasaki, Hiroshima and Tokyo residents

There is a way to do COIN effectively and productively, and brutality followed by security and propserity is not that way.

fixed, History disagrees with you

Reprisals when American soldiers are attacked simply are not worth it. If you come to the table with the view that your soldiers' lives are worth far more than the civilians they are attempting to protect, you will get NOWHERE in trying to win hearts and minds.

is not about the comparitive value of life, but about the absolute impossition of a ceasefire and disarmament by making continued war to unbearable to contemplate, and then creating the seeds of peace. The war and the peace have to be won seperately and in the proper order. You win the hearts and minds after they laydown their guns.

How do you think empires formed, and how do you think the sucessful one slasted or turned into nations? By brutally crushhing thier foes and THEN working on winning over the survivors.

WTF are we doing there in the first place?

building a better tommorrow, and that involves hard choices today.

Americas problem is pansy's who don't have the stomach to win so they drag things out and make things worse. if we accpet the Lancet's figures as accurate 600,000 or so. Thats 500,000 more than would have died if we had gone in big from the get go, and killed the first 100,000 who dared disrupt the peace. BTW thats about the number who have died in secterain violence because we tried to fight a war without shedding blood.
 
 
Zraver you're obviously forgetting one major lesson of history;
somtimes when you subject a people to force, they will indeed bend before it, but sometimes the exact opposite will happen. Your solution would run far too great a risk of feeding the insurgency not destroying it.
But I do agree with you that going hard from the start would have saved a lot of lives in that mysterious thing that everyone seems to have forgotten called the long term.
 
 
Go Long.

Only because the oil which US will get in return will be worth the few lives lost.

Plus, the US will lose credibility if it backs out now from I-raq.
 
 
Zraver the cities you highlight were destroyed during the war. Not after the occupation. Its been "mission accomplished" for three years it would be political suicide to start the kind of operation you are talking about. It won't happen.

It might, might have solved the problem when the time was right, but now it will just cause the region to completely and utterly descend, it would open coalition forces up to attack all over the world, and those forces are not in a position to open any more fronts.

'Cut and Run' Must be First Step in Iraq
by William E. Odom

The United States upset the regional balance in the Mideast when it invaded Iraq. Restoring it requires bold initiatives, but "cutting and running" must precede them all. Only a withdrawal of all U.S. troops - within six months and with no preconditions - can break the paralysis that enfeebles our diplomacy. And the greatest obstacles to cutting and running are the psychological inhibitions of our leaders and the public.

Our leaders do not act because their reputations are at stake. The public does not force them to act because it is blinded by the president's conjured set of illusions: that we are reducing terrorism by fighting in Iraq, creating democracy there, preventing the spread of nuclear weapons, making Israel more secure, not allowing our fallen soldiers to have died in vain, and others.

But reality no longer can be avoided. It is beyond U.S. power to prevent sectarian violence in Iraq, the growing influence of Iran throughout the region, the probable spread of Sunni-Shiite strife to neighboring Arab states, the eventual rise to power of the anti-American cleric Muqtada al-Sadr or some other anti-American leader in Baghdad, and the spread of instability beyond Iraq.

These realities get worse every day that our forces remain in Iraq. They can't be wished away by clever diplomacy or by leaving our forces in Iraq for several more years.

The administration could recognize that a rapid withdrawal is the only way to overcome our strategic paralysis, although that appears unlikely. Congress could force a stock-taking. Failing this, the public, sooner or later, will see through all of the White House's double talk and compel a radical policy change. The price for delay, however, will be more lives lost in vain.

Some lawmakers are ready to change course but are puzzled as to how to leave Iraq. The answer is four major initiatives to provide regional stability and calm in Iraq. They will leave the U.S. less influential in the region. But it will be the best deal we can get.

â€¢ First, the U.S. must concede that it has botched things, cannot stabilize the region alone and must let others have a say in what's next. As U.S. forces begin to withdraw, Washington must invite its European allies, as well as Japan, China and India, to make their own proposals for dealing with the aftermath. Russia can be ignored because it will play a spoiler role in any case.

Rapid troop withdrawal and abandoning unilateralism will have a sobering effect on all interested parties. Al-Qaida will celebrate but find that its only current allies, Iraqi Baathists and Sunnis, no longer need or want it. Iran will crow but soon begin to worry that its Kurdish minority may want to join Iraqi Kurdistan and that Iraqi Baathists might make a surprising comeback.

Although European leaders will probably try to take the lead in designing a new strategy for Iraq, they will not be able to implement it. This is because they will not allow any single European state to lead, the handicap they faced in trying to cope with Yugoslavia's breakup in the 1990s. Nor will Japan, China or India be acceptable as a new coalition leader. The U.S. could end up as the leader of a new strategic coalition - but only if most other states invite it to do so.

â€¢ The second initiative is to create a diplomatic forum for Iraq's neighbors. Iran, of course, must be included. Washington should offer to convene the forum but be prepared to step aside if other members insist.

â€¢ Third, the U.S. must informally cooperate with Iran in areas of shared interests. Nothing else could so improve our position in the Middle East. The price for success will include dropping U.S. resistance to Iran's nuclear weapons program. This will be as distasteful for U.S. leaders as cutting and running, but it is no less essential. That's because we do share vital common interests with Iran. We both want to defeat al-Qaida and the Taliban (Iran hates both). We both want stability in Iraq (Iran will have influence over the Shiite Iraqi south regardless of what we do, but neither Washington nor Tehran wants chaos). And we can help each other when it comes to oil: Iran needs our technology to produce more oil, and we simply need more oil.

Accepting Iran's nuclear weapons is a small price to pay for the likely benefits. Moreover, its nuclear program will proceed whether we like it or not. Accepting it might well soften Iran's support for Hezbollah and it will definitely undercut Russia's pernicious influence with Tehran.

â€¢ Fourth, real progress must be made on the Palestinian issue as a foundation for Mideast peace. The invasion of Iraq and the U.S. tilt toward Israel have dangerously reduced Washington's power to broker peace or to guarantee Israel's security. We now need Europe's help. And good relations with Iran would help dramatically. No strategy can succeed without these components. We must cut and run tactically in order to succeed strategically. The U.S. needs to restore its reputation so that its capacity to lead constructively will cost us less.

Odom is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and a professor at Yale University.

&#169; 2006 The Capital Times

LGen Odom's proposal certainly takes balls.
 
 
 
fixed, History disagrees with you

 

Actually, no. Because what you're describing is not COIN. It's total war. Like WWII and all the others you mentioned. And I believe that total war is not justified without extreme provocation. WWII was a just war; but it was not a clean war. We were fighting against mass murderers bent on world domination, and we fought fire with fire. We burned entire cities to the ground, for the specific purpose of cowing our enemies into submission. To terrorize them, if you will. I do not believe we would be justified in fighting total war against the Iraqis. There is a difference between invading a country because they have declared war on you, and invading a country with the declared purpose of liberation, not subjugation. If we call ourselves liberators, and then brutally subjugate the country, we are nothing but the new bully on the block. Call me an idealist, but I really don't think America should begin empire building.
 
 
Since it's obvious that going home will solve nothing and going long is a doubtable proposition, I voted go big. But in order to win this battle, half-measures and half-assed effort will just not do.

Wow. You ain't kidding. "And now, for something completely different..." What do you think about this proposal? I'm curious about shek and S-2's opinions on this as well.

Seems like it might be worth a try, if the situation truly goes down the toilet. Of course, Odom and many, many others believe that has already happened. It would definitely save American lives in the short run, and perhaps in the long run. Who knows?
 
 
Armchair,

Show me a single instance where a limited war has stopped an insurgency. The closest you wil get is the British in Maylasia, and that involved a very brtal forced relocation program to isolate the communist from thier base. Limited war does not work agaisnt an insurgency, total war does.

The objec tin war is not to kill, but to break the enemies will to resist. The only reason the insurgents are still figthing is they no people like you will eventually cry loud enough to make our leaders pull out and then the flood gates of uncontrolled violence will really open.

The only way to win is to crack down so hard and so fast that open conflcit is no longer an option. The only way Iraq can form an identity as a antion is if the sectarian violence stops.

And I believe that total war is not justified without extreme provocation.

And that right there is the cancer in modern thinking. war is war the only excpetion is nukes. If you allow limited wars with limited or no provocation you end up with situations like Korea, Vietnam, and Iraq. If you decide to shed blood as a matter of national policy to achieve what ever objective you go all out. it saves lives, money, and years of conflict.

There is a difference between invading a country because they have declared war on you, and invading a country with the declared purpose of liberation, not subjugation.

No there isn't if it's war it's war no matter what you call it. We owe those we are "liberating" our best efforts to keep the conflict as short as possible and ge tthem on the road to a better future as fast as possible. Pissing away lives and treasure If we call ourselves liberators, and then brutally subjugate the country, we are nothing but the new bully on the block. Call me an idealist, but I really don't think America should begin empire building.in dribs and dabs is far moe costly.

If we call ourselves liberators, and then brutally subjugate the country, we are nothing but the new bully on the block. Call me an idealist, but I really don't think America should begin empire building.

If we call our selve sliberators and then do nothing but let those we claim to want to help be terrorized by nutjobs, until we just pull out and leave them hanging then we are worse than bullies, we are murderers. Our goal never was to stay and build an empire, but now we have to stop the Iraqi civil war and give them the tools and the oppurtunity to build a nation.

The only way this will be achieved is taking the violence to a level where the insurgents cry uncle lay down and turn in thier arms and join the politcal process. Right now there is zero reason for any warring party in iraq to quit becuase they know without a shadow of doubt the cowards and touchy feely liberals back in the US have persauded the goverment and the people that we lost.

The insurgents like the Vietcong never beat the US, we beat our selve sby listening to people who have lost touch with history and reality, and who don't have a clue about what it takes to win a war.
 
 
i think it's possible to combine "go big" and "go long". go big in the short-term, put some small semblance of order. at the very least clean out sadr city.

then withdraw most of the troops and put the remainder in the north as a giant RRF.

zraver,

 
Show me a single instance where a limited war has stopped an insurgency.
 

the US destroyed the VC after the tet offensive.

Mor elike the VC impale dthemselve son the Americna sword, but still Tet was a GO BIG BATTLE. We went hardcore and won the feild.
 
 
 
Armchair,

you mean apart from Kenya, Oman, Northern Ireland, Oman again, Belize, Sierra Leone, Eastern Europe in WWII, Macedonia.

versus, Iraq, Vietnam and the Palestinian Occupied Territories?

yes, i think you might be onto something.

crack.
 
 
Eastern Europe? I don't think that it was (from the German POV) a very limited war. They were doing all they could to combat partisans, and what they did wasn't very "limited" either. It was rather brutal.
 
 
 
the US destroyed the VC after the tet offensive.

Mor elike the VC impale dthemselve son the Americna sword, but still Tet was a GO BIG BATTLE. We went hardcore and won the feild.

 

Yeah and all anyone cared about was the fact that the VC and PAVN could pull off the offensive in the first place, when you'd been going 'big' for three years. This is an insurgency, the more people you kill, the more people you recruit into the insurgency. Unfortunately it's a tricky business fighting an insurgency, there's no simple or easy solution, but the comparison of British Empire tactics in Malaya and US tactics in Vietnam demonstrates amply that the heavy handed aproach of Vietnam only served to alienate the people that the US was trying to help, while the Australian tactics of fighting the VC with guerila warfare meant that we decreased their activity just as much, while using less ammo, killing far fewer civilians and thus maintaining far more credibility with the populace and all the while taking a lower casualty rate. So you see, the obvious solution of firepower isn't always the optimal one.
 
 
Trust me on this, Go home.

Iraqis would hate on you for creating a mess and leaving. But only a few love you there for being there anyway. Fewer still would love you tomorrow, and even fewer the day after.

Go home. Seriously... Go home.
 
 
Dave Angel,

show me a victory not a conflcit that just dragged on and on until both sides were exhausted.

Spoonman,

Veitnam was not a total war, it was jsut the raw aplication of fire power with non of the other steps afterwards to build stability. The nazi's had the same problem they were willing to do the crushing, but not the rebuilding.

leibstandarte10,

The gemran anti-partisan efforts used 2nd rate forgien formations (SS volunteeers) and POW parole formations. Even in france vs the FFI who had upwars of 100,000 men the gemrans neve rhad more than 16,000 men assinged to security duties.

you guys are fixating on the initial use of force, that is the least important factor in winning the peace. it is only to shock every one into stopping fighting and then you win the peace and that means taking those miltiary aged men and putitng them to work at a fair wage on projects where they get to se ehow they are contributing to thier and thier countries future prosperity.

You have to make peace more valauble to the former combatants than war.
 
 
You're missing the point of the foreigners and the religious based terrorists, who dont really give a crap how bad things get in Iraq, so long as the MNF is forced to pull out.
 
 
 
Beatign an insurgency is doable, but brutal. Outlaw guns and weapons, shot on site type outlawing, Kill Sadr and when his people riot in the streets gun them down with apaches, use reprisals (they are legal if proportionate). Make the cost of coming after US troops so high they simply wont do it.
 

So then the people who don't like us and have guns, don't feel safe and have guns or just have a gun to show off get the choice between giving it to us or using it on us. That might just scare more into shooting at America. Happened with the Moros.

 
Make preaching radical islam or hate a crime punishable by death and then enforce it.
 

And then have the fence sitters join in by the tens of thousands to start shooting. Try and ban the free speech of the clerical class (who can depending on the cleric get quite political or radical) and see what happens.

 
show me a victory not a conflcit that just dragged on and on until both sides were exhausted.
 

Mozambique.
 
 
Mozambique was a 15 year civil war that dragged on and on and on. 900,000 dead, 5million displaced and a country riddled with landmines and you think thats a COIN victory?

So then the people who don't like us and have guns, don't feel safe and have guns or just have a gun to show off get the choice between giving it to us or using it on us. That might just scare more into shooting at America. Happened with the Moros.

Again, it was not the aplication of force on the level I am talking about, the philipines doe snot posses enough armed force to crush a small bug let alone an insurgency, and any action was not followed through with any way to provide hope and win the peace.

And then have the fence sitters join in by the tens of thousands to start shooting. Try and ban the free speech of the clerical class (who can depending on the cleric get quite political or radical) and see what happens.

Do you know how many ideological revolts have been putdown with the sword or gun, true zealots die early and then the survivors remember othe rmore pressing things to do, specially if your offering jobs and hope.
 
 
Withdraw... Nobody cares about the WOT enough to really fight it. Let the radicals have the ME, Africa, and parts of Asia. Maybe round about the time Europe falls to this Islamic Empire, the people of the world will be willing to repeat history...

There are just TWO Islamic theocracies out there. How can you lose hope on all Muslims just by those. Even amongst those two countries, one\'s the EXTREMIST Sunni country the others the extremist Shia country. Even amongst monarchies they really aren\'t theocratic. Not all monarchies are even tyrannical, just look at the UAE and mainly Dubai. They keep their local population happy.

Many nations are ready to join a modern world. You\'d never get there by war. War would make us all shoot for the weapons and take us away from modernization. The best way to defeat terrorism is... Drum roll... Talk them out of it. Basically meaning show them a better path. There are many Muslims who conform their religion with modernity. Surely there must be a plan to convince the terrorists/extremists of that.

Withdraw. Thats the best option but don\'t say paranoid things like the Islamic Empire is out to get you. That only translates into \"Their Empire thinks we\'re going to take over them. So they\'d try to take over us, so we should try to take over them!\" Messy?

Radicals aren\'t going to have the ME just by you pulling out your troops. They are by your troops being there. As Musharraf said while doing the deal with the Taliban (and it kinda applies to the Iraqis as well), \"This is now becoming a people\'s movement\". And with force the only way you can TRULY ensure that no radical pops up is by killing EVERYONE. Are you ready to kill every Muslim out there? No? Then try talking. Talk to people, tell them why being nice is so nice. Be convincing.

Its not that bad.
 
 
 
The best way to defeat terrorism is... Drum roll... Talk them out of it.

 

You've got to be sh!tting me! If Nassar, Sadat, and Hussien couldn't do it, what makes you think Bush can?
 
 
 
Again, it was not the aplication of force on the level I am talking about, the philipines doe snot posses enough armed force to crush a small bug let alone an insurgency, and any action was not followed through with any way to provide hope and win the peace.
 

With law and order in bad shape, militias running around and terrorists, kidnap gangs and so forth do you actually think that people will hand over their guns, their last line of defense, without a fight?

 
Do you know how many ideological revolts have been putdown with the sword or gun, true zealots die early and then the survivors remember othe rmore pressing things to do, specially if your offering jobs and hope.
 

We ain't offering hope disarming them so they can no longer protect themselves and attacking their religous/political leaders will just "prove" that we are there to do bad things.

And furthermore that cuts into the democracy stuff we are spreading. The fun boys got elected.

 
As Musharraf said while doing the deal with the Taliban (and it kinda applies to the Iraqis as well), \"This is now becoming a people\'s movement\".

Mush is a terrorist supporter.

 
The best way to defeat terrorism is... Drum roll... Talk them out of it.
 

You must be joking or sniffing glue.
 
 
 
The best way to defeat terrorism is... Drum roll... Talk them out of it.

 

Do you understand that there are people in the world who don't see things your way?

Have you ever been bullied in school before? You ever try to talk the bully into giving your lunch money back or stop bothering you?

You can no more talk these people out of terrorism than we can talk you out of being a muslim.
 
 
With law and order in bad shape, militias running around and terrorists, kidnap gangs and so forth do you actually think that people will hand over their guns, their last line of defense, without a fight?

when its give up the gun or die... A gun might save their life right now, but in a disarmed iraq it would cos tthem thier life. Ohh and if they want to stop the miltias they can turn them in.

We ain't offering hope disarming them so they can no longer protect themselves and attacking their religous/political leaders will just "prove" that we are there to do bad things.

And so, you dont try winning their hearts and minds until after you've stopped the fighting. You have to do things in order. They can have what eve rmisconceptions they want and plot what ever future vengance they want, but if you follow through the with security, jobs, and hope those flashes of anger will dull and be repalced with hope.

And furthermore that cuts into the democracy stuff we are spreading. The fun boys got elected.

Trying to fight a war and install a democraqcy at the same time while also jumping around with a thumb stuck up our ass in order to be politically correct has sure worked wonders for democracy in Iraq so far hasn't it?

The best way to defeat terrorism is... Drum roll... Talk them out of it.

You don't talk with murderers, your prosecute the and kill them and deprive them of life and freedom. They are rabid like skunks or wild dogs and your doing them and the rest of us a favor in killing them.

hey mr Ali, you've killed 47 of your neighbors, will you please stop that its not very nice.

vs

a hellfire rocketing into his home imolating him and his entire line, in the morning in English an Arabic a sign in seen stuck in the ground near the crater saying- When Ali was alive his neighbors said who is the next of us he will kill, now that he is dead the terrorist must ask themselves who is the next of us to die.

Give it up, die or turn it on someone. Take away peoples last line of protection and threaten them with death otherwise and see what happens. With the way things in Iraq have fallen apart and how unpopular the USA is that would rally more people to the militias. And if you kill some law abiding citizen who has a gun then America would run the risk of the whole damn nation errupting.

Turning in the militias; to who? America? The Iraqi police?

America has done such a bad job providing protection that it would be a crime to disarm law abiding citizens and leave them totally at the mercy of anyone.

Like any other gun control law the bad guys would still have/find guns.
 
 
guns and bombs are fueling the violence as long as they do the killing wont stop. No amount of wishful thinking will make it stop, it will take a concentrated effort to effect a real ceasefire and that means gettign rid of the guns.

you are so off your rocker that its painfull to watch.

firstly you confuse insurgency with terrorism, which while they may co-exist are not the same thing.

secondly you obviously have no concept of the troop density required to excercise the kind of control over the population that you think would work in acheiving your aims. such a troop/civpop ratio is simply unatainable.

as an example: during the military height of the NI troubles there were 20,000 British troops in NI, plus 18,000 RUC police officers to 'control' a population of just over 1 million. now some of those RUC officers and locally recruited soldiers were unreliable (in that they passed information to insurgent/terrorist groups) but in statstical terms the number is tiny. at 38,000 security forces to 1,000,000 gives a ratio of one reliable soldier or policeman to every 26.3 members of the public.

Iraq has a population of 27 million, to achieve the same troop density would require just over one million reliable soldiers and policemen. all of whom speak Arabic...

further you have obviously never studied political movements surrounding insurgencies. nasty, inconvenient bald fact time: when an insurgency has significant public support amongst the constituancy it attempts/claims to represent, every time you kill an isurgent - even if its done in a 'clean' way with gun in hand - you recruit two to his organisation and you further divide the 'pond' he lives in (which is where you get your information from) and the state.

every time you kill one you make killing the next one more difficult and you get two replacements.

your ravings are, i'm afraid, not about making Iraq safer/more compliant, they are about making you feel better.
 
 
Zraver one problem with your idea is that the time has past. The US is overstretched and there is unlikely any ally likely to want to join in to stuff several hunndred thousand troops to assist the several million US troops needed.

Aside from the obvious descention into a regional rather than local conflict there is is also the political problem at home as the western body count rises and the possible need for conscription.

The knock on effect - if ever Iran needed justifcation, if ever DPRK wanted a weakended US in asia this would be it.

If the republicans went for this in the US they might not see power again for a generation.
 
 
firstly you confuse insurgency with terrorism, which while they may co-exist are not the same thing.

I am not confuding anything, the insurgency is more terrorist than freedom movement, they are engaed in secteraian violence and murders agaisnt thier neighbors. By any stadnard 70-80 of the deaths in iraq are secterian related, over 400,000 if we use the Lancets figures.

secondly you obviously have no concept of the troop density required to excercise the kind of control over the population that you think would work in acheiving your aims. such a troop/civpop ratio is simply unatainable.

well historically you need about 1000 per million. In NI the troops wer eused as glorified cops and the violence lasted for decades. A highenoug level of violence will and has foced every population subjected to it to throw in the towel. You have to win the war before you can win the peace.

Trooth,

We don't need several hundred thousand, we have enough troops there, we just need to take the gloves off.

Zraver,
Terrorism is a tactic that lends itself to a successful insurgency. It is working in Iraq, as one can safely say that there has never been a time where Iraq has been secured. No security = no legitimate government. This was due to the lack of coalition (read US troops) deployed, compounded by the idiotic decision to disband the Iraqi military coupled with a half-hearted attempted to build the new force.

Sir, in hindsight, would you say it would have been better if we had kept the old Iraqi army under the trasitional government control, and then transfer it to the current government? How would that work if we had done it? Just call in the high ranking generals to the Green Zone and pass out assignments to each of them?
 
 
yup,

being a senior officer in Saddams Army almost certainly didn't require having strong moral scruples, so principled reticence was unlikely in the extreme.

they would of done the job (securing Iraq, its borders and its population) far better than we ever could have.

to describe the decision to disband the Iraqi Army as niave is taking charity beyond its definition, better descriptions are 'staggering ignorance' 'criminal negligence' and 'fcukwittery'.

Only because the oil which US will get in return will be worth the few lives lost.

 

I am not so sure that the current (probably optimistic estimate) of 1.5 million bbl/day of Iraqi oil exports justifies the cost of the adventure.

Outside of the butcher's tab and other unmeasurable costs, the ten or twelve million dollars a day we are spending on the war in Iraq does not appear to be shaping up as a sound investment.

Too, the 100 billion or so barrels of proven reserves in Iraq are likely to be decades away from proper exploitation and only then it will come at great capital expense.

We have a hard enough time maintaining and expanding POL infrastructure right here in the United States. How the Hell am I to take seriously the notion that we can do it in a war zone where where critical facilities are 20 years out of date and already crippled by successive and continuing military action?

 
Plus, the US will lose credibility if it backs out now from I-raq.
 

I disagree.

Some kind of withdrawl from Iraq is known to our enemies, our allies and ourselves to be a wise and essentially inevitable course of action.

Our allies and especially our enemies respect us for the quality of our choices and we will be more credibile for wise choices rather than continued folley.

Our credibility is not based on what we do now, it will be based on what we do next.

Iraq was a known, proven mantrap a millenium before Abraham left Ur of the Chaladees. How this well known fact escaped the attention of those who brief the President is great food for thought.

I have heard it said "for by wise council thou shalt make thy war: and in multitude of counsellors there is safety." President Bush hamstrung himself in this department. Prewar assesment made a powerful case that trouble with Iraq did not rise to the level of "supreme interests" yet his advisors whom he limited his council to egged him on to war anyway.

It strengthens and emboldens our enemies for us to be in Iraq and our continued presence there disrupts our ties to our allies.

And now, the $20.00 question: where is the wisdom and credibility in pursuing a strategy that makes our enemies stronger and ourselves weaker?

P.S. As you might expect, I am in the "Get Out" camp (with the caveat that it has to be particularly well managed) but then again I was in the "Don't Go In" camp from the get go.
 
 
 
i think it's possible to combine "go big" and "go long". go big in the short-term, put some small semblance of order. at the very least clean out sadr city.

 

Astralis,

The current disorder in Iraq is a direct by product of American interventionism.

Can it logically follow that continued and/or expanded interventionism will solve the problems it created in the first place?

Whether we leave, stay or fight harder may not solve anything for the fault lines along which much of the violence is occuring were present before in Iraqi society/culture ong before lthe U.S. invasion and will no doubt continue to exist for sometime regardless of the course of U.S. policy. Essentially, such violence might be thought of as predestined; Saddam Hussein was just keeping a lid on it for his own purposes.

The best analogy of the situation before the war was that Saddam Husseing was like a rock on top of an ant hill. What happens when you kick the rock off of an ant hill?

The Bush Administration decided to play the part of the child who messed with the ant hill against sounder advice. Now that the ants are boiling over and stinging...well, you all know how these stories go.

William

Talking on CBS' "Face the Nation," Rangel said he will introduce a bill next year requiring Americans to sign up for a new military draft after turning 18. He has said the all-volunteer military disproportionately puts the burden of war on minorities and lower-income families.

gunnut,
Here's the AWC study on reconstructing Iraq that is very illuminating. You can read about their recommendations vis a vis the Iraqi Army starting on page 32 of the report (page 38 in Adobe). As an aside, LTC Crane, who helped author this study, is one of the primary authors of the new joint counterinsurgency field manual.

 http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute...les/PUB182.pdf 

In terms of bringing the Iraqi Army back on board, Cobra II at the very end goes into detail on this - there was an Iraqi general that had the rolls of 100K+ members of the army, and there was US military support for this until Bremer decided to disband the Army, with no plan to absorb these military members into society with jobs, etc. One can wish this point away by saying that it disbanded itself, as I once did, but the reality is that it offered a paycheck, and you could have easily brought back the majority back into the fold. For those that didn't want to come back, then you'd make it easy to figure out who your potential insurgents were. While not an overnight job, certainly a much better solution than what we tried.

We don't need several hundred thousand, we have enough troops there, we just need to take the gloves off.

 

Nah, you don't have enough troops. It's an issue of surface area, it's all well and good to fly around in helicopters and say you're covering more of the country, but if you're not staying in a spot long enough to well and truly clear it, then the insurgents will just resurface there again before too long. The body count mentality isn't going to win this thing.
And yeah, you are confusing terrorists with insurgents. There are a whole lot of different groups in Iraq that are fighting for different reasons. The 'mainstream' of the insurgency is probably the Sunni-dominated Nationalist movements, which are often former Ba'athists and Iraqi Armed Forces personnel. Some of them want a return of Saddam, some of them want to ensure that the Sunnis get what they see as a fair deal, some of them just hate foreigners (understandable, pretty much every major country has perpetually screwed Iraq over for decades). They're not generally interested in starting a civil war, they want Iraqis to unite against the MNF and the government. You'll find they're generally held responsible for the IED attacks and ambushes on MNF and NIA troops. That ain't terrorism, that's guerilla warfare, those people can defend themselves.
Then we have the Jihadists, many of them thought to be foreigners, some backed by Al-Quaeda, some not controlled by anyone, who want to start a civil war between Sunnis and Shi'ites, because to them Shi'ites aren't Muslims, and the people backing them likely see chaos in Iraq as an opportunity to use the place as a base. They're generally the ones you'll find forcing people to blow themselves up in crowded market places.
Then you have the Shi'ites, who have their own Jihadist and Nationalist groups that are either mad at the MNF or are mad at the Sunnis because of all the carbombings and other terrorist attacks.
Then we have common criminals who are just using the situation to kidnap and ransom people, etc.
Basically, the Nationalists are the lesser of two evils, they've killed a lot of civilians and done lots of nasty things, but they're negotiable. They encouraged the Sunnis to vote, and they've been known to kill Al-Quaeda members in Iraq as revenge for ruining their plan to have a united front against the MNF. The Jihadists are the worst threat, they dont care how bad things get in Iraq, they don't care about civilian casualties (indeed they actively seek them) and they avoid fighting the MNF and the NIA, in essence they are terrorists in the true sense of the word. You can't negotiate with them, you cant deter them, you cant scare them, but you can kill them, and indeed many of the militias and insurgents in Iraq are willing to do the same.
The Shi'ite terrorists are largely a consequence of the activities of Jihadists, its' possible that they could be abaited if the sectarian attacks are at least decreased, or stopped.
The criminals are just that, they're a product of poverty and disorder, if those problems can be allayed then their activities will decrease.
So, more troops means more attacks prevented. More troops, more money and something other than an utterly half-assed attempt at reconstruction means less public resentment, less crime and less instability.
Simple logic my man.

While we disagre on the number of trops I think we cna both agree what you wrote abovehas more to do with losing the peace than anything.
 
 
Zraver,

Ok, Captain Dave Angel and I are Commonwealth Armies with the traditions of the British Army and the British Empire. We've never had the strength to control the territories through the "Go Big" strategies that I think we've mis-interrupted you.

Both the Captain and I were UNPROFOR, we've NEVER went big but we've accomplished the mission.

Explain yourself. What do you mean by "Go Big."
 
 
OoE, force is a realtive term, NATO did go big in Bosnia and Kosovo with a bombing campaign, it just was a smaller aplication of force beucase the Serbs threw in the towel rather quickly.

Then NATO moved ground forces in and has kept order, although I wont say they've built a lasting peace.

The level of violence in Iraq is many magnatudes highers and will probably require more force to ge tthe insurgents to agree to laydown their arms and join the political process.

The forst part of going big is to rachet up the us eof force and relax the RoE to the point where the insurgents find the politcal process to be more valauble than continuing the conflict.

Then you need to go big on reconsruction and put all those angry military age men to work providing forthier families so that they see whith their own sweat that iraq has a future and they get to share in it.

Hm. Shouldn't that be "Hundreds of thousands had been murdered, and millions would be made refugees, after we invaded?" Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought most of the genocide and such happened in the early nineties, and the refugees happened after the war began. If so, one can hardly call the Iraq War a response to the genocide. I'm not saying that the fact that Saddam was an evil mass murderer who probably would do more evil things if given the chance was not part of the reason we went to war, but it was hardly an urgent preventative measure.

Only about ten percent of the mass graves have been excavated so far and one in the south of the country that has been excavated contained over 1000 bodies and had been 'filled' less than four months before the invasion.
 
 
I have no problem correcting you when your wrong Armchair,

Saddam' willful and deliberate obfuscation and deception on the issue of WMDs meant the sanctions could not be lifted. These sanctions caused untold suffering and over a million deaths. To alievate this the UN started oil for food, only to see Saddam subvert it as well for his own selfish ends.

from 1992 to 2003 1.5 million iraqies died for lack of medical care or proper nutrition most of them children and elderly. Now if thats not genocide what is it?

Somewhere on WAB I read up on the figure 600,000 civilian casulties.(I think the figure was put forth by Amnesty..so lets say even if 300,000 people are dead..hell..thats a big number.)

And who made SADDAM..?Who made OSAMA..?

OBL hates everyone who is not a Muslim from the Jews, Soviets/Russians to the Hindu's (he often sent AQ trainees into kashmir for experiance) through the Serbs and on to the American's.

I could go on forever. The greatest problem is that it has been impossible to secure the sites properly so the full extent wonÂ’t be known, but HRW, Amnesty et al estimate from surveys of the Iraqi population that the number of people who Â‘disappearedÂ’ during Saddams regime to be over a million. There has been very little investigation done after the initial flurry as the ongoing warfare makes it very difficult for civilian investigators. Probably ten years from now weÂ’ll be able to do a proper survey.

I'm damned if I can find the report of this specific case so you'll just have to take my word for it sorry, but IIRC they were all adults, almost all male, with a mixture of unknown/broken bone & lesions/bullet to the back of the head, so probably it was a 'cleansing' of those who had been held in prison to that time, either beaten to death or shot.
The period from 91 to invasion was characterised by 'family' executions, where the family was required to watch the execution, or was executed along with the male.
Usually men either shot or 'unknown causes', women and children shot, children under 3 simply thrown in alive with the parents and siblings, as they were unable to attempt to climb back out.
If you follow through the links I've posted above, there's a fair bit of witness testimony and forensic evidence. When Saddams trial evidence is made public there'll be more.

Somewhere on WAB I read up on the figure 600,000 civilian casulties.(I think the figure was put forth by Amnesty..so lets say even if 300,000 people are dead..hell..thats a big number.)

And who made SADDAM..?Who made OSAMA..?

Sometimes US with its myopic eyesight makes its enemies.  

 

Draconian,

The 600K figure is derived from a shoddy survey and is not credible. I'd place some confidence in a 300K figure, although I think that that is still high. Given that we are just about to the 4K mark each month, even if we applied that same mark to every single month of the conflict, then you'd only be at the 150K mark. Add in insurgent/terrorist KIA against coalition forces and Iraqi Army KIA during the four weeks of state on state fighting, and you'd still be stretched to even come close to the 300K mark. Now, it's true that passive body counts won't include those that are never brought to the morgue, and so any "hard" counts will underestimate the true count, but remember, we easily overestimated the figure by interpolating the recent crescendo of 4K deaths a month. Bottomline, Iraq is a bloody mess right now, but I don't think that it should be a huge suprise given that we opened up the proverbial Pandora's box by removing the regime and left a security vacuum remain.

Yes Draconian. Sorry.

Incorrect.

Approx. 53,000 civilians confirmed. Many others include terrorists, insurgents, and enemy soldiers.

 
And who made SADDAM..?

 

Saddam took power in Iraq without US assistance. Otherwise his 2 primary supporters were the USSR (and Russia after the collapse of the USSR), and France. He was pretty much self made.

 
Who made OSAMA..?

 

As with Saddam, the lust for power.

 
Sometimes US with its myopic eyesight makes its enemies.  

 

You can be anti-American if you wish, but you cannot point to a country that did not provide some support to a bad guy, nor to one that is not supporting at least one now.

All are meaningless aruments to my original point.
 
 
Perhaps meaningless is too strong. But I'd agree with severely overstated.

Is that less!!!  

In WTC attack, some 3000 people died and America freaked out.(like it any other country would have too.)

If I am not wrong, the US supported Saddam and was its quasi-ally to oppose the Iranian influence.

Then again, I may be wrong

You mean to say the ISI and the mujhideens alone could over come the USSR?  

I daresay, Pakistan does not have the balls to do something like that!(and so would be the case with India...)

On the contrary, I am pro-America. Though to be really honest, I do really detest the american foriegn policy in some cases.

I hope this is more meaningful!

Draconion
 
 
Draconian,

Saddam killed hundreds of thousands of his own people. By the time all is said and done, I think that it will be most likely that more will die from the violence unleashed by removing Saddam and then leaving a security vacuum. The question that I think should be asked right now was whether it was worth the opportunity to create something new - and I think you can argue it both ways. History will render its own verdict once the dust settles, whenever that is.

As far as Saddam, Saddam came to power without US help, so he is a home grown creation. That being said, the US did aid Iraq in the aftermath of the Iranian revolutions, and so at one point he was an ally; however, that is different from being a US creation.

As far as OBL, I'll let the following website make my points in detail. The US did not deliberately or directly create OBL. That being said, it would be a fair statement that the US would have approved of his existence if he had been on the radar screen in the 1980s since he was serving our goals of defeating the USSR.

This may be a "meaningless" argument, but it is a point that I would like to bring up.

Assuming Iraq is on the brink of a civil war, has anyone ever considered this?

When America was on the brink of the Civil War between the States, did you know that immediately prior, Congress passed legislation to stop international countries (i.e. England and France) from intervening and/or aiding and abetting?

Is there, or was there, any international laws that exist pertaining to the situation in Iraq? If so, would it pertain to countries of insurgents, such as Iran and Syria, or even the US? Just a thought.

Julie,

The Union got smacked down by Britain over the Trent affair. It was moral repunation by Britain and to a lesser extent by France that resulted in non-interference, with the Emancipation Proclamation providing the nail in the coffin for foreign intervention. Sorry, but the realist in me finds domestically passed legislation to be only symbolic.

On a different note, Iraq has asked for a coalition presence through the auspices of the UN, a presence that has been renewed. A decision to not renew wouldn't be enforceable, but it would have an effect.
 
 
To a certain extent, as a person who will probably attend law school, I wanna say that the international law matters.

But I just don't think Iran and Syria give a damn about them, when serving their interests in Iraq. That's kinda why international law is a bit "fuzzy", cuz its gotta be either respected, or at least countries have to be punished. But the world works by realpolitik. You can sign any agreement or international treaty you want, in the end it seems at least in places like the Middle East it comes down to what you can inforce. You can quote me on this, the pen that signs onto international law agreements is only as mighty as the sword that stands behind it.
 
 
swift sword,

 
Astralis,

The current disorder in Iraq is a direct by product of American interventionism.

Can it logically follow that continued and/or expanded interventionism will solve the problems it created in the first place?

Whether we leave, stay or fight harder may not solve anything for the fault lines along which much of the violence is occuring were present before in Iraqi society/culture ong before lthe U.S. invasion and will no doubt continue to exist for sometime regardless of the course of U.S. policy. Essentially, such violence might be thought of as predestined; Saddam Hussein was just keeping a lid on it for his own purposes.

The best analogy of the situation before the war was that Saddam Husseing was like a rock on top of an ant hill. What happens when you kick the rock off of an ant hill?

The Bush Administration decided to play the part of the child who messed with the ant hill against sounder advice. Now that the ants are boiling over and stinging...well, you all know how these stories go.

Regards,

William
 

i posit that the current disorder is not so much due to simply american interventionism but POOR american interventionism. the problems we see today arise from simply a lack of central control necessary for a stable society. allawi, by almost all accounts, did a better job instituting this than maliki.

in any case these are merely military solutions, and in this case, past complete obliteration, a purely military solution will not work. a political solution that involves the military is iraq's only hope, and the US must put enormous diplomatic pressure on iraqi political leaders to at least reduce sectarian conflict at the head.

part of this diplomatic pressure- and this acts as both carrot and stick- is the presence of the US military, which has a short-term calming effect on the areas which it occupies (if not by killing the insurgents, at least making them run away or keep their heads down).

if they cooperate, go big and go long might be part of a process that can keep iraq stable. if they do not cooperate, well...

Or, alternatively, US troops could provide targets for people to take their anger out on instead of doing something productive about their bad situation, like say, try to look for work.

Just like troops are both carrot and stick, they are also both a calming force and targets all at the same time.

Its hard to strike a middle ground between security proper and economic security. On the one hand, people got to be given opportunities for work in order to find there to be enough incentive in that to stop being a part-time insurgent (obviously won't work with a real committed jihadist). On the other hand, can you even start providing those opportunities without security proper being in place first? And if the processes are simultaneous, how exactly do you make them go hand in hand?

I just remember plenty of instances where we rebuilt bridges or other infrastructure just to have insurgents blow them up again. I think the processes do have to kinda be simultaneous at least to an extent. But how implementation of those at the same time would work? I have no idea, I'm trying to read up on it right now, but its still unclear.

Noted. But, if not passed, for whatever reason, could you imagine the outcome if Britain and/or France had intervened? I feel the importance of that legislation in place is more than symbolic, otherwise it would have re-written history.

 
On a different note, Iraq has asked for a coalition presence through the auspices of the UN, a presence that has been renewed. A decision to not renew wouldn't be enforceable, but it would have an effect.

 

We are currently attempting to support a government that does not fairly represent all factions. It is not democratic, and there will be continuous uprising there until that happens.
 
 
 
Perhaps meaningless is too strong. But I'd agree with severely overstated.

 

No, his points really had nothing to do with my point.  

 
Lets say its 53,000.

Is that less!!!  

 

Less than the hundreds of thousands killed, and millions made refugees? Yeah. And even if it wasn't, how long would you be willing to let it go on, and extrapolate that death count too.

 
If I am not wrong, the US supported Saddam and was its quasi-ally to oppose the Iranian influence.

Then again, I may be wrong

 

The US provided approx. 1% of Saddam's military support, none before, or after, the Iran Iraq War. Saddam had come to power long before that.

 
You mean to say the ISI and the mujhideens alone could over come the USSR?  

 

OBL was a nobody then, and according to the reports was a piss-poor soldier as well. He recieved no direct support from the US.

 
I hope this is more meaningful!

 

Honestly, no. It doesn't contradict a word of what I originally wrote.  

 
With due respect.(I'm dealin with a mod here people...never know when they loose it!! and throw me out   )

 

No worries here. Those posts of yours were fine.  
 
 
 
Congress passed legislation to stop international countries (i.e. England and France) from intervening and/or aiding and abetting?

 

That was just a US federal law. It was something to use to threaten trade with foreign countries if they aided the South. Otherwise it was just paper and hot air.
 
 
 
I feel the importance of that legislation in place is more than symbolic, otherwise it would have re-written history.

 

It was symbolic because it didn't have any meaning to anyone but US federalists. Nobody is required to abide by, or be protected by, our laws, except us. If another country had decided to help one side or the other, and there were many occurances of covert support of course, they could have. Some piece of paper in a North government building would not stop them.

 
We are currently attempting to support a government that does not fairly represent all factions.

 

Name even one that does.

It's a democratic republic. You don't really want a democracy, trust me, wanna talk about potential to be unfair.
 
 
julie, confed,

 
We are currently attempting to support a government that does not fairly represent all factions. It is not democratic, and there will be continuous uprising there until that happens.
 

actually, the problem is that the government is TOO democratic. there are no real checks and balances in play that protect the minority (civil society, judicial system, professionalized bureaucracy, et al). this is what happens when you try to rush democracy, with an especial emphasis on elections (these should come LAST).

as fareed zakaria calls it, an illiberal democracy. the sunnis, the minority, are being pushed around by a vengeful shi'ite majority. and unlike the kurds...the sunnis are in closer contact to the shi'ites, as to make detachment (the kurdish solution) not really viable.
 
 
Julie I think you are really quite wrong. I can assure you that if all parties were equally represented today, the level of violence would not suddenly drop. You're overestimating their value of the democratic process. They're more worried about resources dominance. They don't have enough experience with democracy yet to be all worried about being represented.

They can forget about resources dominance, PSA contracts have been being discussed with 4 major oil companies as early as 2003. But, if you're speaking of who controls those funds, then you have a point.
 
 
Don't forget, that the democratic process requires a lot of trust i.e. social capital, to work correctly. It requires rule of law to be (at least sorta) established. We cannot expect all that in a system that is being established with in a legal-rational manner, but does not yet apply to everyone because the central authorities have yet to gain the monopoly over the legitimate use of force. Dated though Weber's theories may be, they are pretty impressive in helping you define stateness even today.
 
 
Well, I'm in agreement with the majority of Iraqis on this one. And it's encouraging that I find myself in the majority with those who've responded to this poll, as well.

Yirmeyahu,

1. Have the Iraqis voted on the three options presented in this poll? No. So, trying to compare these results to the WPO poll is a little bit of apples and oranges. Now, that doesn't invalidate the WPO results, and I will not argue against them, just pointing out the inconsistency to where you cannot fully extrapolate the results and apply them here.

2. There is no majority in this poll. The "Go Home" option enjoys a plurality at this moment; however, if you had to develop a majority position, then it would be that we need to stay for now instead going home.
 
 
One consdideration. "Go home" will severely damage US foreign policy both at home and abroad.

If the perception is going home early it will become "cut and run" regardless of spin. This will make future alliances and interventions difficult.

You saw how people on this board reacted when Spain decided to "Go Home" for example.
 
 
trooth,

foreign policy professionals have been debating this for ages, using examples ranging from the roman empire to the qing empire to the british empire to vietnam.

i'd say, looking at the evidence, the PR effect of an orderly withdrawal is not as bad as all that. surprisingly enough, the ghost in the closet here, vietnam, is actually a pretty good example of the effects of an orderly withdrawal. for all the bellyaching about "cut and run" back then, the effect it had on US foreign policy, and how other nations treated the US, was rather muted- both in the short-term to the long-term.

right now, that's what "go home" is- not a dash for the exits, but closer to a shuffle.

the biggest concern for US policymakers regarding "go home" should be its effects inside iraq, and not so much perception of US strength. to be honest, perception of US strength has slowly declined since the spring of 2003, after the lightning 21-day victory in OIF I.

what effects we DO feel for having "cut and run" (again, a misnomer) would be balanced by the fact that we would be shifting 150,000+ veterans out of urban terrain, where US technological strength is weakest, and back into a giant fist, where it can act once more as a credible deterrent. in effect, telling the rest of the world that our spear is no longer mired in mud.
 
 
I have personally thought for a long time that if any kind of force reduction was to be carried out, we could put troops that we do have left in the desert. Out of the public eye where people are agitated, but ready to help the Iraqi army where necesarry.

Another idea was setting up in Kurdistan. Hell, that can be a regional base. The population isn't hostile, we could put an airbase there, and a contigent of troops that could easily go to other parts if Iraq or ME to reinforce. The terrain is mountainous and fairly hard to attack as far I understand. It would make sense to base the 101st Airborne there.

This way you are still a potential presence in Iraq and you have more bases throughout the region from which to carry out ops, but out of a backyard where the kids don't wanna play nice (Sunni/Shia territory).

Any thoughts?

The expulsion of Iraq from Kuwait was seen by many as the action that freed the US military intervention from the ghosts of Vietnam. The well executed action with low casualties. The stablisation of the no fly zones and the mostly complete withdrawal from the combat area was seen as proving US strength, US commitment (i.e. left when the job was done - regardless of views of toppling Saddam at the time the objective was removing him from Kuwait not from Iraq) etc.

There was a blip with the way the operation in Somalia was handled (the somewhat overt timetable that was frequently declared by Clinton).

If Go home is soon (which i assume it is intended to be otherwise it would be go long) then it will be spun into cut and run (it is inevitable). The US was in Vietnam for 20 years and lost 58,000 troops. I think in that context pulling out of Iraq is cut and run.

Whilst i agree, 150k battled hardened troops makes a more formidable force. Much like Vietnam, Iraq will be debilitating from a political and military point of view. There will be a lack of confidence of the public in future operations as there will be a lack of confidence in managing the peace. This will in turn make the US military less potent - since ultimately there will be thoughts of "if it is to intervene on the ground, will the next operation be another Iraq?".

One of the reasons i think "Go long" is that the US troops casualties are not that high by military standards (i believe there is an "acceptable" loss rate for live fire exercises - how does the current US KIA figure of circa 2,900 compare in 3 years out of 150,000 compare?). Also, unlike vietnam, none of the soldiers present are conscripts, they are all professional soldiers who volunteered knowingly. Don't get me wrong, every life is important, but the death toll has to be put into some context - Not a job i would want in the media but still i think it has to be mentioned.

And, regardless of how we got here, i don't believe that pulling US troops out would reduce the non-US death rate significantly at this point.
 
 
trooth,

several things:

 
If Go home is soon (which i assume it is intended to be otherwise it would be go long) then it will be spun into cut and run (it is inevitable). The US was in Vietnam for 20 years and lost 58,000 troops. I think in that context pulling out of Iraq is cut and run.
 

first off, vietnam was really from '65-'72, with US involvement beyond both ends a good deal more limited. also, i'm not so sure that we ought to use vietnam as a context of what constitutes "cut and run"- do you think that if we leave prior to reaching the same casualty level as vietnam, it would constitute "cutting and running"?

 
Whilst i agree, 150k battled hardened troops makes a more formidable force. Much like Vietnam, Iraq will be debilitating from a political and military point of view. There will be a lack of confidence of the public in future operations as there will be a lack of confidence in managing the peace. This will in turn make the US military less potent - since ultimately there will be thoughts of "if it is to intervene on the ground, will the next operation be another Iraq?".

 

can you honestly say that we haven't reached this point already? from a domestic standpoint, no one is speaking of "victory" in OIF III, at least not in the sense we first imagined: a iraqi democracy, economically self-sufficient and friendly to both US as well as israel- a model for the middle east (remember that blog, "Iraq the Model"?).

right now we're just trying to get stability, and we're already finding THAT to be lacking.

from another standpoint, the two things we mention here- lack of confidence of the public and lack of confidence in managing the peace- are all factors that will influence the short-middle-term. we recovered from vietnam surprisingly quickly, as our last boys withdrew in '75 and we were engaged in grenada by '83.

 
One of the reasons i think "Go long" is that the US troops casualties are not that high by military standards (i believe there is an "acceptable" loss rate for live fire exercises - how does the current US KIA figure of circa 2,900 compare in 3 years out of 150,000 compare?). Also, unlike vietnam, none of the soldiers present are conscripts, they are all professional soldiers who volunteered knowingly. Don't get me wrong, every life is important, but the death toll has to be put into some context - Not a job i would want in the media but still i think it has to be mentioned.
 

they are not that high by military standards, sure, but given the 24-hour newscycle and MOST IMPORTANTLY the somewhat dubious effect the troops over there have on our foreign policy goals in iraq (and the middle east), the costs, both human and financial, are not sustainable for much longer for the US body politic. to sustain the costs, american voters would like to know if the costs are worth it. we spent $50,000 for a BMW, but it is increasingly looking like we spent $50,000 for a used pinto.

 
And, regardless of how we got here, i don't believe that pulling US troops out would reduce the non-US death rate significantly at this point.
 

as nice as lowering the non-US death rate significantly is, the main point of the exercise is to determine if changing the course will be better for our foreign policy objectives. our most immediate objective is to somehow produce an iraqi government that is capable of keeping order without massacring the sunni minority in the process. "going big, going long, and going home" at this point are all military methods in trying to keep the environment just stable enough to allow us to make headway towards that most immediate objective.

Trooth,
There is no acceptable loss rate for live fire exercises. If you lose a soldier during a live fire exercise, then somebody f*cked up. That doesn't mean that they are not realistic (although a commander that doesn't understand both the art and science can create unimaginative live fires that seem too canned) - it's just that you rehearse your battle drills and maneuver until you are ready to do it with live bullets. It is a confidence building exercise that builds trust in those on your left and right.

1. I said I was in agreement with the majority of Iraqis on this issue. That, as you know, means I would like to see the end of the US military presence in Iraq. It's a perfectly valid observation.

2. This is senseless doublespeak. There is an option which had been chosen by the majority of those who voted at the time I wrote. It remains the majority opinion, according to the poll. It was the option I chose. Therefore, I made a perfectly valid observation.

1. The Iraqis haven't been polled on "Go Big, Go Long, or Go Home." Therefore, there cannot be any agreement with Iraqis since they haven't defined their position on the three options. The question was not end the military occupation or stay forever. If you were to read the article that initiated the thread, then you would understand the poll question.

2. No doublespeak, just an accurate application of the English language. A majority means more than half - there is no majority position unless you were to ask between the options of "Go Home" or remain in Iraq in the near term using another strategy, in which case, the "Go Home" option would be in a minority, since both "Go Big" and "Go Long" involve staying in Iraq in the near term using another strategy. Now, if you had chosen to use the word plurality at the time of your posting, then you would have had a valid observation.
 
 
1. The Iraqis have repeatedly been polled as to their will, and they've repeatedly reaffirmed that they would like to see the US military "Go Home". So, when I say I'm in agreement with the majority of Iraqis on this issue, that is precisely correct, and a perfectly valid observation.

2. A "majority", as I used it, means "the greater quantity or share", which, both at the time of that writing and as of now, is in favor of "Go Home". So, when I say I'm in agreement with the majority of those who've responded to this poll, that is precisely correct, and a perfectly valid observation.

You are precisely INCORRECT, and your observation is perfectly INVALID. Shek it right. A majority means that more than 50% of the voters voted for the issue in question. A plurality means that less than 50% voted for the issue, but that vote got more than any other vote.

You are wrong. As I already said, "majority", as I used it, means "the greater quantity or share". Ergo, when I say I'm in agreement with the majority of those who've responded to this poll, that is precisely correct, and a perfectly valid observation.

"Majority" also can mean "a number or percentage equaling more than half of a total", but that is neither the only definition of the word nor the context in which it was used by me.

If you have a problem with the definition of the word as I employed it, take it up with Merriam-Webster.

The way me and Shek used it, is how the academic fields of political science and international relations define it. But, of course, you wouldn't know that, as you've clearly demonstarted that you know nothing of these fields.
 
 
 
Then try talking. Talk to people, tell them why being nice is so nice. Be convincing.

 

Yeah, we shoulda tried that with Hitler too....  
 
 
 
My definition matches the one in the dictionary pretty exactly. And you know what the difference between me and you is? I knew that before I had to look it up.

 

Why do you assume I looked up "majority" in the dictionary prior to making my post? That is false. I only looked it up after you demonstrated that you weren't familiar with its several usages in order to enlighten you to the fact that it has more than one meaning.

As I've already stated several times, I used the word "majority" to mean "the greater quantity or share." Ergo, when I say I'm in agreement with the majority of those who've responded to this poll, that is precisely correct, and a perfectly valid observation.
 
 
 
trooth,
first off, vietnam was really from '65-'72, with US involvement beyond both ends a good deal more limited. also, i'm not so sure that we ought to use vietnam as a context of what constitutes "cut and run"- do you think that if we leave prior to reaching the same casualty level as vietnam, it would constitute "cutting and running"?

 

I took '55 as i believe that is the date the vietnam memorial picks as the start date, but 58,000 over 7 years is an even higher casualty rate and 4 years longer than the US has been in Iraq.

 
can you honestly say that we haven't reached this point already? from a domestic standpoint, no one is speaking of "victory" in OIF III, at least not in the sense we first imagined: a iraqi democracy, economically self-sufficient and friendly to both US as well as israel- a model for the middle east (remember that blog, "Iraq the Model"?).
 

Well. Not at that moment. You will have to forgive me here, because my belief about the Iraq war was always that it was a necessary precursor (due to the patrolling of no fly zones etc) to an attack on Syria and possibly Iran. Therefore i never subscribed to the model.

But it matters nought how we got here. We are here and as such what do we want to do? Yes it isn't working out but if we leave and let the region descend what have we really achieved and what does US foreign policy look like? When the US wants help with DPRK, or possibly Venezuala who is going to put their hand up? Who is even going to support the operation in the UN? Yes i know the US doesn't mind acting unilaterally, but will the polticians and public want to? That was the big thing about the removal of Saddam from Kuwait - that it was as much a multilateral operation as could be expected.

 
right now we're just trying to get stability, and we're already finding THAT to be lacking.

from another standpoint, the two things we mention here- lack of confidence of the public and lack of confidence in managing the peace- are all factors that will influence the short-middle-term. we recovered from vietnam surprisingly quickly, as our last boys withdrew in '75 and we were engaged in grenada by '83.
 

True, but Iraq I and II were ground wars against million men armies. They were history changing (well II more than I but the potential was there). Yes, i agree that US ability to intervene has already been damaged by Iraq. But the question is what heals it, leaving now or seeing it through? I do believe it will come good. I think the regional powers will want it to come good. Because it otherwise will spill over to them. If the US leaves and this precipitates a descention into utter cross border chaos then i don't think the US will recover from that for a couple of generations.

 
they are not that high by military standards, sure, but given the 24-hour newscycle and MOST IMPORTANTLY the somewhat dubious effect the troops over there have on our foreign policy goals in iraq (and the middle east), the costs, both human and financial, are not sustainable for much longer for the US body politic. to sustain the costs, american voters would like to know if the costs are worth it. we spent $50,000 for a BMW, but it is increasingly looking like we spent $50,000 for a used pinto.
 

Certainly i think the US public was not sold the Iraq war properly. I don't mean all the flip flopping from liberation, freedom, WMD etc. I simply mean the fact that this was always going to be complex, that it was always going to be dangerous, long winded and expensive regardless of the reason for invading. 24 hour media is here to stay and will be a factor in all future engagements. Which engagement can the US attempt if 1000 casualties a year is too much? Compare that to road deaths in the US.

Personally i think the US people were sold a $50k BMW and were delivered a $50k classic in need of serious restoration. It will take several years.

 
as nice as lowering the non-US death rate significantly is, the main point of the exercise is to determine if changing the course will be better for our foreign policy objectives. our most immediate objective is to somehow produce an iraqi government that is capable of keeping order without massacring the sunni minority in the process. "going big, going long, and going home" at this point are all military methods in trying to keep the environment just stable enough to allow us to make headway towards that most immediate objective.
 

I agree. And of those three options, i don't see going big working (because i can't see a go big target) and as we are discussing i favour going long.

I think US foreign policy has actually been without direction for quite some time. Post 9/11 the US was serious about the WOT. I am not sure that such a thing genuinely could be expressed in foreign policy (since there will always be terrorists / freedom fighters). However i think the medium term goals were (in order) Afghanistan, Syria (via Iraq), Iran (since promoted because of nuclear ambitions) and DPRK (not through military means). Iraq was a military step not a strategic WOT objective (imho) and this miscalculation has enabled Iraq to derail everything. The US is now extremely unlikely to be able to solve Syria / Iran / DPRK unilaterally and i think multilaterally it is, perversely, reliant on the regional objectives of Syria and Iran and the Asian 5.

Ultimately you may be right. Since we are both talking about withdrawal from Iraq as being inevitable (i.e. neither of us is entertaining a German model of 60 years of military presence) then perhaps it is time to get out and let the wounds heal. But i think those wounds could last for quite some time.
 
 
 
Yeah, we shoulda tried that with Hitler too....  

 

You guys are better at talking now. American education is sought by people all around the world. Someone showing them a better way might be the only thing needed. There are many people amongst locals who\'d do it as well. But that depends upon you guys backing off and supporting those people first. If pinned down the logical choice would be to team up with the nuts against you guys first.

Priority #1. Go home.
 
 
 
1. The Iraqis have repeatedly been polled as to their will, and they've repeatedly reaffirmed that they would like to see the US military "Go Home". So, when I say I'm in agreement with the majority of Iraqis on this issue, that is precisely correct, and a perfectly valid observation.

 

What were the Iraqi numbers on "Go Big" and "Go Long," and please provide the link to the poll. Thanks.

 
2. A "majority", as I used it, means "the greater quantity or share", which, both at the time of that writing and as of now, is in favor of "Go Home". So, when I say I'm in agreement with the majority of those who've responded to this poll, that is precisely correct, and a perfectly valid observation.

 

If you look up Merriam Webster, you'll see that the example that applies in this context is "a number or percentage equaling more than half of a total <a majority of voters>", whereas you are attempting to use a definition out of context "the greater quantity or share <the majority of the time>". We are discussing a poll where you vote, and not time (which is used in a dichotomous scenario).

If you find this interpretation to be a minority one, then you can search definitions from other dictionaries:

 http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/majority 

The majority of dictionaries support our use of majority and plurality.
 
 
 
Why do you assume I looked up "majority" in the dictionary prior to making my post? That is false.

Point to me where talking alone ever worked.

 
Priority #1. Go home.

 

Go home via Seoul or Saigon?
 
 
 
Point to me where talking alone ever worked.

 

Let\\\'s simplify it. It worked when my mom n dad taught me right from wrong. Something that basic can be done too. My advice get the adults into construction. I\\\'m guess with the destruction you guys made in the invasion and the worse mess the rebels made afterwards there\\\'s plenty to be rebuilt.

Ask some IRAQI company to start constructing, rebuilding. Construction is something any illiterate man can also pretty much do. At least as labor and its a good, respectable work.

Meanwhile target the youth. In 10 years, you\\\'d see the difference. Iraqis aren\\\'t born with the guerrilla warfare DNA, they are taking it up for a cause or they don\\\'t know any better.

#1 going home would take away the cause. #2 Talking (which basically means teaching, sparking a debate in the media, heck setting up a media, bringing back some common services, perhaps the postal service is down, perhaps the internet is bad, perhaps there aren\\\'t any sporting events) would be the long term strategy. First of all sectarianism is an Islamic mistake that happened 1400 years ago. A lot of people don\\\'t even recognize themselves as Sunni/Shias. Most who do, don\\\'t care about it and live their lives normally and let the others live theirs. So I\\\'m pretty sure that not the WHOLE country would be busy with sectarianism hoohaa and can be brought to order.

Perhaps with your money, but not by you.

 
Go home via Seoul or Saigon?
 

Either that was something too witty or too subtle. I didn\'t get it.

Duuuuuuude, I WANT guerilla warfare DNA!!!!!

The Iraqis, as I have observed repeatedly, as evidence by any number of polls, have repeatedly expressed their will, and they've repeatedly reaffirmed that they would like to see the US military "Go Home". So, when I say I'm in agreement with the majority of Iraqis on this issue, that is precisely correct, and a perfectly valid observation.

How many Iraqis espouse a view similar to the "Go Big" or "Go Long" ones expressed here I don't know. I don't need to know. It's irrelevant. Iraqis who espouse such views are a small minority. The majority overwhelmingly want the US occupiers to go home.

 
If you look up Merriam Webster...whereas you are attempting to use a definition out of context
 

Are you trying to tell me the meaning of the word I intended when I used it? I've told you repeatedly, the definition of the word as I used it would be "the greater quantity or share".

The first of your many mistakes.
 

As I already observed, the "mistake" was on your part for wrongly assuming that I looked up "majority" prior to making my post. As I have already observed, I did so afterwards in order to demonstrate to you your error in believing that the word has only one definition, and that I must be using the definition you were familiar with.

The only construction that can go on in a combat zone is a minefield. Until you can own the battlefield, you cannot build on the battlefield. You have to end the violence before anything else.

Who's doing the bombing and dying in Baghdad? It ain't the Americans.

It only takes a brutal few to terrorize the rest - and they are terrorizing.

Yirmey,

Your observations are both invalid, still.

You cannot cite polls that only provide two choices - stay (of varying lengths) or go. Trying to make inferences from these polls that do not control for the size of the American force nor the role of the American force is fallacious, as "Go Big," Go Long," and "Go Home" all have different troop levels and roles. In other words, the polls you reference do not reflect all available choices.

To illustrate what you are trying to do, if a poll was taken in 2000 for the Presidential campaign that only listed two candidates, Gore and Bush, then a fallacious conclusion from this poll would be to declare that Nader would not receive any votes.

As far as your use of majority, once again, the example provided in Merriam Webster for your supposed use is dichotomous, while this poll is not. Notice that the definition you cite uses the word "greater" and not "greatest." "Greater" is a comparative adjective that is used to compare two things, while "greatest" is a superlative adjective used to compare more than two things. Thus, your use "your" definition in the wrong context, as this poll has three options, not two options.
 
 
 
Seoul Korea and Saigon Vietnam. We came home from both. You pick the example Iraq to follow.

 

How about Kabul? After the Soviets left.

Let Saudi or Iran handle Iraq.

 
You know probably the worst thing about this war is? We have revealed our weaknesses to the entire world. That aint good.
 

The stated goal? To make everything right?

That\'s the thing, its been a recent theme of anyone launching a large scale attack. A show of grandiosity, that they are going in for a much larger cause than to just say defeat an enemy.

America\'s enemy was Saddam. They defeated him. That should\'ve been it. Yet they took upon themselves to \"fix\" Iraq since if successful it makes them the nicest people on the planet and justifies the President to give all those contracts to his friends in oil companies and others involved in reconstruction.

Defeating Saddam was Americanly possible. Doing this is not possible. Not by the Americans. They don\'t have to kill. See they are the ones that Iraqis want to kill the most! So basically America\'s given them an objective too which is kind of possible. As long as they manage to kill 50-100 American soldiers a month, they\'d recruits would think its working. Not to mention the 50-100 families a month getting pissed off about the war back in America.
 
 
The war was and is winnable if America decides to actually fight a war. War means killing and you either doit upfront and then get on with theb post war reconstruction. Or you drag it out and watch as more people die ove r alonger period of time. The failure of America to go for the kill since the end of WW2 is what is repsonsable forthe building defeat in iraq, not the insurgents.
 
 
so, who do you propose to kill, and how do you do it with current force levels?
 
 
Shek,

So, when I say I'm in agreement with the majority of Iraqis on this issue, that is precisely correct, and a perfectly valid observation.

And, again, when I say the majority of respondants to this poll, here, espouse the view that the US should "Go Home", by "majority", I mean "the greater quantity or share". "Go Home" has a greater share of votes than either of the other two options.

So, it's precisely as I said.
 
 
Yirm, Hitler also never admitted that he was wrong when he was. It is not a good quality on your part.
 
 
 
How about Kabul? After the Soviets left. Let Saudi or Iran handle Iraq.
 

Just like how Pakistan handled Afghanistan?

 
See they are the ones that Iraqis want to kill the most! So basically America\'s given them an objective too which is kind of possible.
 

Nope they Sunnis and Shiites want to kill each other the most; America is in the way.

Yirmey,

1. Two option polls cannot infer results to three option polls. Sorry. I don't know how I can express this more clearly, although I think your denial is not a function of my being unclear.

2. "Greater" is a comparative adjective used to compare two things. This is a three option poll, and so you cannot use a comparative adjective. Ergo, you are using "your" definition in the wrong context. Once again, I don't know how I can express this more clearly.

Bottomline, two does not equal three. If you do not understand this, then you cannot understand why you are wrong.
 
 
 
Just like how Pakistan handled Afghanistan?

 

Exactly. Good example.

Taliban weren\'t the best of governments but once the Soviet war was over the same crap was going on over there. Probably much much worse. Pak got a handle on the situation.

At any given day we are more likely to stabilize Afghanistan than is America.

Same case with Iraq I guess. Damn, good example.

 
Nope they Sunnis and Shiites want to kill each other the most; America is in the way.
 

Actually its easier to kill each other for them. But Americans are still the hot sought after targets. Remember that article about the Sniper? You can clearly note his expressions when talking about killing an America vs killing an Iraqi.

How much of a consolation it is if you are the second most hated group there anyway? :D

 US Iraq panel \'to urge withdrawal\' 
 
 
 
Exactly. Good example.

 

Good example? We're here today exactly because Pakistan couldn't handle it.

 
How much of a consolation it is if you are the second most hated group there anyway? :D

 

We're not there to be consoled. We're there to do a job.

Nope the Shiites and Sunnis are killing off each other as the prime targets. Nothing to do with soft targets those are the people they want to kill. They ain't blowing up Mosques hoping to catch Marines at prayer.

 
Exactly. Good example.
 

Three thousand of my people were murdered because of the Taliban and Pakistan.

 
Taliban weren\'t the best of governments but once the Soviet war was over the same crap was going on over there. Probably much much worse. Pak got a handle on the situation.
 

Weren't the best???? Murdering Shiites??? Banning TV?? Thier treatment of women???

Kabul was leveled becuase of Pakistan. Is that the handle they got? And FYI it was leveled after the Commuists were out of power.

 
At any given day we are more likely to stabilize Afghanistan than is America. Same case with Iraq I guess. Damn, good example.
 

******** on 9-10 your Taliban allies were facing not only wars with the ethnic minorities (Tajiks/Uzbeks/Hazaras) but increasing revolt among Pashtuns who resented the Taliban using them as cannon fodder. There was no stability.
 
 
Stan187 and shek,

I have no interest in debating semantics.

a) Most Iraqis, as polls have indicated, want the US to go home.
b) Most respondants to this poll believe the US should go home.
c) I believe the US should go home.
d) Therefore, it is a factual observation to say that I am in agreement with most respondants to this poll and most Iraqis that the US should go home.
 
 
 
Withdraw... Nobody cares about the WOT enough to really fight it. Let the radicals have the ME, Africa, and parts of Asia. Maybe round about the time Europe falls to this Islamic Empire, the people of the world will be willing to repeat history...

 

Hit the nail right on the head, listen to Ahmedinijhad's various speachs and it gives you chills how much it reminds you of Hitler.

Sad thing is we are about to repeat history by not taking a madman at his words. We are too busy trying to find the enemy within our own country's rather than ditching the PC crap and standing up to the REAL enemy's.
 
 
smilingassassin,

In what ways do Ahmedinijad's speeches remind you of Hitler? I'm just curious.
 
 
 
Stan187 and shek,

I have no interest in debating semantics.

 

Then why do you continue to fight logic and the English language? Your actions do not match your words. A disingenuous statement.

 
a) Most Iraqis, as polls have indicated, want the US to go home.

 

These polls provide two choices - stay or go.

 
b) Most respondants to this poll believe the US should go home.

 

Wrong. For the duration of the poll, most respondants believe the US should stay. For example, right now, 16 have voted for the US to stay while 13 have voted for the US to "Go Home."

 
c) I believe the US should go home.

 

We understand.

 
d) Therefore, it is a factual observation to say that I am in agreement with most respondants to this poll and most Iraqis that the US should go home.

 

It is not factual. It is just plain wrong. You cannot infer results to these three options when polls of Iraqis do not control for troop size or troop role. This is plain and simple. If you ever take an applied statistics course or an advanced econometrics course, you will learn this (however, it doesn't require one to have take these courses to understand the concept). For d to be correct, a, b, and c must all be correct - they are not.

Two does not equal three.

Shek, you just don't get it do you. We are wrong. Wrong for trying to apply our scientific ways onto Yirm, who obviously knows nothing of them. Why are we trying to be good social scientists, when this guy does not understand the simplest of terms and basic step-by-step logic.

Its like arguing with a Tickle-Me-Elmo: no matter what you say or what points you make, when it starts talking, it always says the same damn thing.
 
 
 
Good example? We\'re here today exactly because Pakistan couldn\'t handle it.

 

We got the majority population ruling. It was the best possible solution for present day Afghanistan. They like that kind of governance man. Look at what they are trying to do in NWFP, Pakistan with the Hasba Bill.

Of course Al Qaeda was even better than us at cuddling up with them.

 
We\'re not there to be consoled. We\'re there to do a job.
 

Yes, and so far it seems like you have this weird desire to make Iraq and Afghanistan into cool western style nations. Become champions of human rights and civil liberties. Not happening man, so not happening.

IMO we need to employ tactics that would stop violence and establish a government that can rule nationwide. With Afghanistan that can only happen with a merger of the current setup and the Taliban. With Iraq it will only happen with Shias and Sunnis working together.

A secular, democratic Iraq/Afghanistan are just not happening.

You're joking me! They were still fighting tooth and nail against the Northern Alliance and where was the support when the NA marched into Kabul?

 
Of course Al Qaeda was even better than us at cuddling up with them.

 

The mighty ISI who chased the superpower 115,000 Soviet Army from Afghanistan could not handle 3000 ragheads.

 
Yes, and so far it seems like you have this weird desire to make Iraq and Afghanistan into cool western style nations. Become champions of human rights and civil liberties. Not happening man, so not happening.

 

And two votes with record turn outs and all that hope was...what? Chopped liver?

The Taliban is dead. It's gone. It died this last summer. What's now is Taliban in name only. Omar ain't coming back. Nobody wants him back. I hold less illusions of a united Afghanistan than you do.

 
With Iraq it will only happen with Shias and Sunnis working together.

 

That will only happen when they stop shooting at each other.

 
A secular, democratic Iraq/Afghanistan are just not happening.

 

Every country in the world is a democrazy. People vote by bullet or by ballot. Right now, they have chosen the bullet and you have to win that vote before you can resort back to the ballot.
 
 
 
You\'re joking me! They were still fighting tooth and nail against the Northern Alliance and where was the support when the NA marched into Kabul?

 

Tooth and Nail? They had 95% of the territory? From the looks of it, they just didn\'t bother with the rest.

[quote[The mighty ISI who chased the superpower 115,000 Soviet Army from Afghanistan could not handle 3000 ragheads.[/quote]
So can\'t you guys.

We admit we screwed up there. We didn\'t handle the situation in a Pashtun way that we should have. But if we were wrong in expecting a Pakistani style Afghanistan you guys are way off expecting an American styled one.

 
And two votes with record turn outs and all that hope was...what? Chopped liver?
 

You want to believe that? Go ahead. The reality is in the morgues! What was that? 1600 killed a month?

How many died on 9/11? 1400?

 
The Taliban is dead. It\'s gone. It died this last summer. What\'s now is Taliban in name only. Omar ain\'t coming back. Nobody wants him back. I hold less illusions of a united Afghanistan than you do.
 

So we split Afghanistan and Iraq into pieces? Nice...

Spoken like a Brit some 100 years ago... Divide and rule?

 
That will only happen when they stop shooting at each other.
 

And you guys can\'t do that. No way, Sir. You need someone from the hood to do that.

 
Every country in the world is a democrazy. People vote by bullet or by ballot. Right now, they have chosen the bullet and you have to win that vote before you can resort back to the ballot.
 

You are taking too much time man. The whole world is watching... And morgues are filling up. Soon mass graves would fill up. 1600/mo. The body count\'s ticking.

You guys won the war, find some solace in that. Now step aside and go home  
 
 
 
Tooth and Nail? They had 95% of the territory? From the looks of it, they just didn\'t bother with the rest.
 

Didn't bother with the rest?!?

********. You are either a ****ing stupid assclown or just don't know about the subject.

The front line stalemated and even with Pakistani advisors/mercs/volunteers and petro dollars from the Saudis and the UAE the NA was holding and retaking ground. The Taliban had laready reached its high water mark before 9-11. The Taliban's offensives were being thrown back and the NA was grinding away at Taliban manpower which had led to uprisings in Pashtun regions over being used as cannon fodder which is why they had to make such use increasingly of Pakistani wackos to fill the ranks.

And with the ink blot policy of Massoud by 9-11 the Taliban were not in control of 95 percent.
 
 
 
Tooth and Nail? They had 95% of the territory? From the looks of it, they just didn\'t bother with the rest.

 

Yes, tooth and nail or are you unaware the strength committed to those fights? And the other 95% didn't seemed to care much looking at the re-enforcements that actually arrived to defend both Kabul and Khandahar.

 
So can\'t you guys.

 

Wrong. We've killed Al Qeida. Al Qeida died months after 11 Sept. Al Qeida as an organization is gone. Dead. Finished. Al Qeida as a brand name took over. Those 3000 hard core members are reduced to a dozen ragheads making videos and running for their lives... if we are to believe Musharraf. If not, then, we're going to prepare for another war.

 
We admit we screwed up there. We didn\'t handle the situation in a Pashtun way that we should have. But if we were wrong in expecting a Pakistani style Afghanistan you guys are way off expecting an American styled one.

 

In case you haven't noticed, we're not expecting anything. We're not doing anything near as much as the Soviets did with their reconstruction efforts. The NGOs and the PRTs are a sham. We're there to kill.

 
You want to believe that? Go ahead. The reality is in the morgues! What was that? 1600 killed a month?

 

That does not change the fact that it has happenned no matter how brief.

 
How many died on 9/11? 1400?

 

2973 with another 24 missing

 
So we split Afghanistan and Iraq into pieces? Nice...

 

Afghanistan and Iraq will be what their people are going to make them to be. I have no say in their choice, even if it's civil war. We have a chance to help them avert it... IF AND ONLY IF that is what most of them want.

 
Spoken like a Brit some 100 years ago... Divide and rule?

 

We're not ruling anything.

 
And you guys can\'t do that. No way, Sir. You need someone from the hood to do that.

 

In case you haven't noticed, very, very few are stepping up to the job.

 
You are taking too much time man. The whole world is watching... And morgues are filling up. Soon mass graves would fill up. 1600/mo. The body count\'s ticking.

 

So? The world is a hypocrit. What were you doing when 800,000 Rwandans were being butchered as cattle? Time is not on our side but not because the world is watching but because both the Iraqis and the Afghans are getting impatient. They couldn't care less what the rest of the world thinks.

 
You guys won the war, find some solace in that. Now step aside and go home  

 

If we leave now, we invite civil war. If we stay, we have a chance of helping them avoid that... or at the very least shorten it and provide some semblence of security from one another.
 
 
 
Yes, tooth and nail or are you unaware the strength committed to those fights? And the other 95% didn\'t seemed to care much looking at the re-enforcements that actually arrived to defend both Kabul and Khandahar.

 

The little snag in defending through fortified defenses was that America could keep the aerial bombing going on and on and on. Almost all of their people went to the mountains.

But before America was there what was the state of the Northern Alliance? Insignificant. The significant group, the Pashtuns were in power. You need to stop differentiating between Pashtuns and the Taliban. Whether they side with AQ or not, Pashtuns are going to behave like the Taliban in any given day.

 
Wrong. We\'ve killed Al Qeida. Al Qeida died months after 11 Sept. Al Qeida as an organization is gone. Dead. Finished. Al Qeida as a brand name took over. Those 3000 hard core members are reduced to a dozen ragheads making videos and running for their lives... if we are to believe Musharraf. If not, then, we\'re going to prepare for another war.
 

Musharraf never said that. All you\'ve done is scattered them around. You have broken their backs, indeed, so has Pakistan (I think that\'s what Musharraf really said too). But the numbers have probably increased. You can prepare for all the wars you want, but all you\'ll be able to get is \"territory\". You guys are SO not the right people to \"win hearts\".

Their back is worth squat, every little thing of them is a big enough nuisance. Remember the jubilation after Zarqawi was taken out? Still people are dying in Iraq, still Americans are dying. How\'s Anbar province? Now you\'re even losing territory.

 
In case you haven\'t noticed, we\'re not expecting anything. We\'re not doing anything near as much as the Soviets did with their reconstruction efforts. The NGOs and the PRTs are a sham. We\'re there to kill.
 

fine. kill everyone then. Because thats the amount of people that will fight you guys. You have to kill everrrrrrryone.

You sure have killed Al Qaeda, broken their backs. But now whatever your definition of Al Qaeda was in both the countries, you can probably define that as any pissed off citizen. That\'s why I say they\'ve definitely increased. In Iraq its the pissed off sunnis. In Afghanistan the Pashtuns are basically now the Taliban. You\'re fighting the people. Go ahead, Kill em.

 
Afghanistan and Iraq will be what their people are going to make them to be. I have no say in their choice, even if it\'s civil war. We have a chance to help them avert it... IF AND ONLY IF that is what most of them want.
 

Nope, they don\'t want it, they don\'t want your help... When will you figure that out?

 
we\'re not ruling anything.
 

Pretexts, pretexts.

Go ahead divide them. Let\'s see how this experiment works.

 
In case you haven\'t noticed, very, very few are stepping up to the job.
 

Pak just did. Our stated official policy is now to involve the Taliban into the current Afghan government. The arguments are mostly the same as I posted above. They ARE the majority in Afghanistan. Not total control, just the Pashtun areas.

Make autonomous regions with each ethnicity controlling their provinces.

 
So? The world is a hypocrit. What were you doing when 800,000 Rwandans were being butchered as cattle? Time is not on our side but not because the world is watching but because both the Iraqis and the Afghans are getting impatient. They couldn\'t care less what the rest of the world thinks.
 

Pakistan has only committed the largest UN peacekeeping force in \"Rawanda-like\" regions. We are getting commended for them. Rwanda just became your responsibility, through all the media outcry and perhaps Oprah.

Hmmm say did Pak try to influence any regime change in Sierra Leone?

 
If we leave now, we invite civil war. If we stay, we have a chance of helping them avoid that... or at the very least shorten it and provide some semblence of security from one another.
 

Again, Saudi has stepped up. You guys want to fight with Iran otherwise you\'d notice they want to participate too. Let them go in as a UN force. Heck their Mullahs alone would just calm things out.
 
 
 
Make autonomous regions with each ethnicity controlling their provinces.

 

That doesn't work unless the minority ethnicities have their rights firmly protected and ingrained in a constitution-like document, and have the rule of law as per said document be forcibly protected by the authorities.

We got a long way to go until that can even begin to be viable.
 
 
 
But before America was there what was the state of the Northern Alliance? Insignificant. The significant group, the Pashtuns were in power. You need to stop differentiating between Pashtuns and the Taliban. Whether they side with AQ or not, Pashtuns are going to behave like the Taliban in any given day.
 

Pakistan supported them because they didn't act like how a Pashtun acts on a given day such as the issue of music and of course destorying Sufi graves. And the Taliban who had grown up outside of Afghanistan attempted to force a bad mix of Pakistani fundamentalism onto major cities with rather liberal populations (such as Mazar-e Sharif).

They relied on Pakistan for support and to keep in power; just the way Pakistan wanted it. The same with their last proxy Hekmaytar (him and Pakistan you know leveled Kabul) who lacked a true base of support to fall back on.

Pakistan has been using Islamists for years to mess up Afghanistan; predating the Communist government. So please...

And the NA was very significant or else the Pakistanis wouldn't have had officers, artillerymen, pilots, merchanics and madrassa students over there trying to and failing to defeat them.

 
Pak just did. Our stated official policy is now to involve the Taliban into the current Afghan government. The arguments are mostly the same as I posted above. They ARE the majority in Afghanistan. Not total control, just the Pashtun areas.
 

**** you that was the bastards plan before 9-11. Mushy polishing a turd hoping to turn it into a diamond. The Taliban are only around because Pakistan is keeping them safe.

It is highly doubtful that Iran/Russia/Tajikistan/Uzbekistan would accept the Taliban running Afghanistan or even having a part. There is not a Russian motorized infantry brigade in Tajikistan for no reason.

 
In Afghanistan the Pashtuns are basically now the Taliban. You\'re fighting the people. Go ahead, Kill em.
 

Far from it; the Taliban are basically in Pakistan. They are haboring the Taliban and allowing them to rearm and refit. And I shall repeat there were uprisings against the Taliban before 9-11 among Pashtuns and several important Pashtuns along with their forces (such as Sayyaf) joined the NA.

 
fine. kill everyone then. Because thats the amount of people that will fight you guys. You have to kill everrrrrrryone.
 

The heavy fighting is because NATO is going after their drugs.

 
The little snag in defending through fortified defenses was that America could keep the aerial bombing going on and on and on. Almost all of their people went to the mountains
 

Into Pakistan.

Do you think if we leave Iraq we will not start to pay attention to Afghanistan and our "ally" Pakistan arming the enemy?
 
 
 
That doesn\'t work unless the minority ethnicities have their rights firmly protected and ingrained in a constitution-like document, and have the rule of law as per said document be forcibly protected by the authorities.

We got a long way to go until that can even begin to be viable.

 

You got a nice bargaining chip right now to tell the Taliban, \"if you want in, this n this is the constitution, publicly agree to it\".

A federation system would be best. Autonomous in all things except defence/economy. Just don\'t ask them to go ahead and protect minority RELIGIONS or Women, or fight against child labor or fight the drugs trade.

Edit: Just autonomous provinces, would ensure all ethnicities are represented. Now what they do inside is their business.

Since I don\'t think any side would agree to those things. If they would, they are just lying to look good in front of America which would at that stage be doing a true transfer of power and mediating things. It\'s still going to be a weird backward society. But get some sort of government up, stop the WAR and then deal with those things by TALKING to them.

And the Hazaras who form the third largest group and are Shiite; a minority religion.
 
 
 
Wrong. For the duration of the poll, most respondants believe the US should stay. For example, right now, 16 have voted for the US to stay while 13 have voted for the US to "Go Home."
 

"Go Long" entails "shrinking the force on the ground". Your error is to group respondents of "Go Long" with those of "Go Big", when "Go Long" is neither, but, in fact, contains elements of both. I could just as easily group "Go Long" with those who want the US to "Go Home", just not immediately, in which case it would be 23 to 7 by the current count. It would be a similar error.

When I say I am in agreement with most respondants to this poll and most Iraqis that the US should go home, that is a factual observation.

Notice he wont address any real arguments. He'll stick to the "nice little Taliban, nice little Pak doing good, bad America no talk only go bang bang", line.

Pak supported the Taliban and played a huge role in Afghanistans current state. Now, we are told: Taliban represent the Pakhtoons and they must be talked to. Sure.

The war was and is winnable if America decides to
actually fight a war. War means killing and you either doit upfront
and then get on with theb post war reconstruction. Or you drag it out
and watch as more people die ove r alonger period of time. The failure
of America to go for the kill since the end of WW2 is what is
repsonsable forthe building defeat in iraq, not the
insurgents.

 

Zraver,

This position is to ignore the lesson of Vietnam: do not alientate
your allies, your own populous or the very people you are claiming to
be helping with your violence.

The United States found out the hard way in Southeast Asia that the
rest of the World is watching and that without the rest of the World's
support tacit or otherwise, it is really hard to push a strategic
agenda.

What was the rest of the World watching in Vietnam?

Just a couple of the more poignant images below.

Being human beings, most people are not to hip to burning children, summary executions and the other trappings of war, tending to get turned off by such things and will not support them.

Dead Americans and dead Iraqis cost the Bush Administration a great deal public confidence and alienated our traditional allies which has made it difficult for the President to push his strategic agenda. Something tells me that more dead Americans and Iraqis is going to increase the costs rather than decrease them

Regards,

William

No, this is not confusion. Both "Go Long" and "Go Big" entail staying in Iraq. "Go Home" entails not staying, i.e. a complete withdrawal. These are opposites. Ergo, they are grouped properly when you try to play the dichotomy of stay/go as you have the entire time during the thread.

Neither "Go Long" or "Go Big" entail a permanent presence, and so stay is a relative term, and has been a relative term this entire time. If you want to play the dichotomy as being stay permanently or go permanently, then the options provide no choice, as they all involve handing over security duties completely to Iraqi forces at some point in time, and so the only possible general answer is go. This would invalidate the entire discussion, and therefore, it cannot be the proper contextual use of stay/go.

However, this is an interesting post since you recognize that "Go Long" and "Go Big" are separate options (on two sides of the same coin - stay), and yet, you still persist that Iraqis have voted on this despite the fact that there is no existing poll where Iraqis have been presented ALL options. You cannot have it both ways.

Your logic is inherently flawed.

EDIT: If you wished to group "Go Long" and "Go Home," then the argument would have to be troop size. In one group, you have a reduction in troops, in the other, you have an increase in troop size. However, this context has never been used in the argument, and so your attempt to argue for this grouping does not follow from the thread discussion. You have argued about stay/go the entire time, as opposed to increase/decrease.

The only reason some posts got the snub from me was because of all the \"****\" in them. Generally people resorting to curses have already lost the argument so why bother with them?
 
 
Poignant image indeed, but without context. This is a picture of a VC being executed by a South Vietnamese general after having killed members of that very same general's family.

Ironduke,

Swift Sword's point is that by the Americanization of the war, the actions of our allies became inseparable from our actions (IIRC, the girl was running away from a napalam attack by the SVN Air Force - I could be wrong on this, though), and provided a propaganda tool all the same.
 
 
 
Notice he wont address any real arguments. He'll stick to the "nice little Taliban, nice little Pak doing good, bad America no talk only go bang bang", line.
 

Yep that is it in a nut shell. Doesn't know anything other then Pakistans propaganda on the Taliban.

 
(IIRC, the girl was running away from a napalam attack by the SVN Air Force - I could be wrong on this, though), and provided a propaganda tool all the same.
 

It was a VNAF A-1 Skyraider which was dropping napalm in supoprt of the ARVN.
 
 
 
Yep that is it in a nut shell. Doesn't know anything other then Pakistans propaganda on the Taliban.

 

There's no point in continuing this discussion when he could not tell the difference between Taliban and Patshuns.
 
 
Sir;

 
There's no point in continuing this discussion when he could not tell the difference between Taliban and Patshuns.
 

You're right there is no reason to bash my skull into the wall over a troll.
 
 
shek,

You are right, both "Go Long" and "Go Big" entail keeping troops in Iraq, and therefore, I was in error to say I was in agreement with the majority of respondants to this poll.

I am in agreement with the respondants to this poll who chose the option that both at that time and as of now has received the most votes.

However, the fact that Iraqis haven't been given this exact poll is irrelevant. The fact is that Iraqis have been polled, and the polls indicate that the majority of Iraqis want the US to go home.

Hence, to say that I am in agreement with the majority of Iraqis that the US should go home, that is a factual observation.
 
 
 
Indeed, and he insists on this ethinic federalism even though I noted exactly why it cannot work in Afghanistan.

 

That\'s why I answered you.

 'Go Big,' 'Go Long' and 'Go Home'

Please differentiate.

Yirmey,

I am glad to see that you have finally yielded to logic, at least partially. As we have seen, it is possible is to synthesize multiple positions into two opposing positions controlling for the differentiating factors.

However, it is fallacious to go in the other direction, i.e. trying to infer results from two opposing positions where nothing else is controlled for. In other words, you cannot expand positions A and B into positions A, B, and C, if all the differentiating factors have not been controlled for.

Polls of Iraqis that I have seen provide Iraqis a choice between go and stay of differing lengths. They do not control for size of troop deployment or the role of US troops. Therefore, you cannot infer how these factors would affect Iraqis choosing between A, B, or C.

Unless you produce a poll that controls for go/stay and size of the staying force and the role of the staying force, then you cannot claim harmony with a majority Iraqi position, because Iraqis have not spoken on the "Go Home", "Go Big," or "Go Long" option.

I don't think Yirm's talking about that poll anymore. He's just saying that, in general, he wants America to withdraw from Iraq, and the majority of Iraqis in various polls have expressed this desire as well.
 
 
 
That\'s why I answered you.

 'Go Big,' 'Go Long' and 'Go Home' 

 

If what they do inside the provinces is their own business, then the minorities are NOT necesarilly being represented. The only groups represented would be the majority ethnic in each province, which is exactly the problem that I pointed out originally. It is still a non-workable solution.

It's good enough.

You want a western like society? That'd be just a little worse than India/Pakistan if you ask me. It'll be a country where all ethnicities can live happily in their own provinces united between a federation.

Then they can be nicer to each other's province if their relations improve.

Hazaras and Pashtuns HATE each other. They want to rule over the other in the other's province. Minority or majority be damned. So its a big positive if they can just share the nation-space and coexist in their own provinces.

It won't be like America where a guy from Indiana can go work in NASA in Houston, but he can live as a nice farmer in Indiana at least. You need to get out of your western mind frame and not be idealists with Afghanistan and Iraq.

No it isn't good enough, its shortcut that setting up the groundwork for more fighting later, that won't cut it. That's akin to cutting and running. Oh yeah, lets just include the Taliban while we're at it too... That's rediculous.
 
 
I repeat... The Pashtuns are the Taliban. The believe in a Mullahistic rule.
 
 
 
I repeat... The Pashtuns are the Taliban. The believe in a Mullahistic rule.

 

You're saying every Pashtun is a Taliban?
 
 
I'm saying a big majority of them are.

An insignificant fortunate, educated, urbanized minority class of pashtuns might not like their policy on covering women and growing big beards but will also support them when it comes to implementing ISLAMIC LAW... BY FORCE :D (PLay some orchestra music with that).

They totally love to have things that way.
 
 
When Pak introduced the secular law of separating rape cases from the traditional shariat way of deciding guilt. Which basically introduced new clauses which ensured that when women are raped they don't get sent to jail for having sex outside of marriage (Unless four pious Muslim men can come forward and verify the rape as eye-witnesses)... The Pashtun women all came out on the streets wearing Burkhas and objecting that 1400 years ago four men were used in such cases so it should still be so.

Stupid right? They are being empowered, this n that. They don't care! They care about their tribal cutlure first and foremost.

You got figures from reliable sources? Or are you just speculating?
 
 
Daily interaction... With the moden Urban guys. Who still support Islamic rule in their regions.
 
 
But how's The President of Pakistan?
 
 
 
I'm saying a big majority of them are.
 

And uprisings among the rural Pashtuns happened why? Armed uprisings with Taliban members killed in the late 1990s. There would not have been the need to use so many Pakistanis if not for that Pasthuns didn't want to die for the Taliban in the numbers needed. Large groups of Pashtuns began to defect or desert which led to the increasingly reliance on foreign manpower.

Their lack of popularity was noted by Massoud who planned to use it for his long range planning. And of course there were Pashtuns in the Northern Alliance not just as single members but as full militias. They Taliban had reached their high water mark in the late 1990s and had lost increasingly their popularity in their strongholds.

The fact that they fell apart so quickly (aerial attacks had rather little to do with it actually) and have to stay in Pakistan and terrorize the local rual Pashtuns near the border attests to this (attacking villages which had irrigation systems repaired by Canadians which the Taliban never fixed nor wanted to).

They were just another artificial creation of the Pakistanis like Hekmaytar. Pakistan supported them because at the end of the day the Taliban needed Pakistan to stay in power because they lacked popular support.

 
An insignificant fortunate, educated, urbanized minority class of pashtuns might not like their policy on covering women and growing big beards but will also support them when it comes to implementing ISLAMIC LAW... BY FORCE :D (PLay some orchestra music with that).
 

As a side note the Communist leadership of both parties was Pashtun as was the Khalqi rank and file and off the top of my head Parchims majority was Pashtun as well. And then there are tradintional Pashtuns who didn't support the Communists or Islamists but fought the Soviets. There are westernized Pashtuns. And who can forget the Maoists.

 
But how's The President of Pakistan?
 

A jackass (with a bad wig) who supports the Taliban.
 
 
 
You got figures from reliable sources? Or are you just speculating?

 

Look no further than the Afghan National Army (compare to the Taliban strength) and tell me who the Patshuns are supporting.
 
 
 
Go big na dthen bigger.

1- Order and Security

Beatign an insurgency is doable, but brutal. Outlaw guns and weapons, shot on site type outlawing, Kill Sadr and when his people riot in the streets gun them down with apaches, use reprisals (they are legal if proportionate). Make the cost of coming after US troops so high they simply wont do it.

 

This is just a stupid and dumb proposition from a child.
USA made all the garbage in Iraq, and you just want to make it deeper.
Grow up, retarded boy, you won't win anything but dead american soldiers, and even a worst image of your country in the world, like this.

"America has the biggest"... you didn't talked about the brain, of course.
Just a pity to read a sh_it like that.
this board is definitly a meeting of moron.

ANYhoo, back on the subject of the Iraq Study Group, here's my feeling on the whole disgraceful mess, perfectly summed up by Podhoretz:

WITLESS 'WISDOM'
By JOHN PODHORETZ

December 1, 2006 -- YES, it's been quite a week for the 10 members of the Iraq Study Group, the committee formed last spring to offer recommendations on a path forward in Iraq.

They had a wonderfully invigorating leak session the other day with The New York Times, which was the first recipient of the group's key top-level save-America recommendation. Co-chairmen James "Is There An Arab Dictator Nearby Whose Butt I Can Kiss" Baker and Lee "Yes, I'm Still Alive" Hamilton didn't even bother to pretend to brief the president or key lawmakers first.

The president could wait his turn. After all, this is the Iraq Study Group we're talking about here, buddy. Even the mighty Times was probably kept waiting for its leak, since the only person who could not be kept waiting was Annie Leibovitz, celebrity photographer nonpareil.

As Dana Milbank reports in The Washington Post, on Monday the group's "co-chairmen, James Baker and Lee Hamilton, found time... to pose for an Annie Leibovitz photo shoot for Men's Vogue."

The value of Annie Leibovitz's pictorial scoop might have been reduced somewhat when the president scornfully consigned the Iraq Study Group to the ash-heap of history yesterday with a single dismissive sentence during his press conference in Jordan: "This business about 'graceful exit' just simply has no realism to it whatsoever."

Baker, Hamilton and their crew of old Washington hands (and I mean old, like Metheuselah-level old) are recommending a "gradual pullback" of American troops but without a timetable. That basically translates into a nice, long, slow defeat - the "graceful exit" of which the president spoke so harshly.

As one of the study group's members told the Times yesterday, "We had to move the national debate from 'whether to stay the course' to 'how do we start down the path out'."

This is the consensus view of the Iraq Study Group, which is very proud that it reached consensus.

Its members also reached a consensus view that Depends is a really fine brand of adult diaper, and that they love reruns of "Murder, She Wrote."

You perhaps note that I am writing with extreme disrespect toward the Iraq Study Group. That's because its report is a scandal and an embarrassment; it's flatly immoral to seek to make or guide policy in this fashion.

Look, if its members believe the war is lost, they should say so. They should bite the bullet and advocate a pullout of American forces sooner rather than later.

If its members could not actually achieve consensus on that point - if, in other words, some of its members still believe the war can be won while others believe there's no way to achieve victory - then it was simple vanity on the part of the Gang of 10 that led to the creation of a "consensus" document that split the difference.

There's no way to split the difference, unless you're hurrying off to have your mug immortalized by Annie Leibovitz and want to bang down the gavel so you can get plenty of time to get hair and makeup done.

America and its allies are either going to win this war or we're going to lose. We will either conclude our military actions in Iraq with terrorists and insurgents dead or fled and an imposition of civil order in the country by its elected government, or we will turn tail and leave the place in chaos and ruins.

What's even more appalling, if true, is the group's other key recommendation - which is that America should try to find answers to its problems through an international conference that would include Syria and Iran.

What do Syria and Iran want more than anything else in the world? To see an American defeat in Iraq. To see an America so crippled that they can work their will in the Middle East without fear of retribution. Syria could swallow up Lebanon whole once again. Iran could do whatever it chooses inside and outside its borders (develop and peddle nuclear weaponry, sponsor terrorism against Israeli and Western targets) with impunity.

They're going to be a great help. But then, that's Baker for you. Give him a problem and he'll tell you your best hope of solving it can be found in sucking up to an Arab dictator.

But why would his potentate pals agree to help us with our graceful exit? Well, because we'll force Israel to give away, well, Israel to the Palestinians, of course.

Oops. Another problem: Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert this week said yet again that if the Palestinians would only stop shooting missiles and kidnapping soldiers and such, Israel would destroy settlements and pull back from occupied lands and recognize a Palestinian state - and give the Palestinians money and kiss their cheeks and fall on their knees and have a big hootenanny.

So there's not much that even James Baker can demand of Israel that Israel's not already willing to give. Except maybe Jerusalem. Yeah: Israel can give up Jerusalem, and in exchange, Iran and Syria will leave Iraq alone.

Please stop laughing at the doddering old fools now. It's disrespectful.

This is an extremely dire situation. Half-measures will be disastrous, whatever form they take - and that's not true only of the Baker-Hamilton "graceful exit" disaster. Continuing as we're going would also constitute a half-measure with disastrous results as well.

The president treated the Baker half-measures with the contempt they deserved. But he will deserve precisely the same level of contempt if he doesn't champion a plan for victory immediately.
