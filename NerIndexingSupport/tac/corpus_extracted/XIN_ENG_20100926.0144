The Ethiopian Tadese Tola, the 10- kilometer race world record holder, won the
Lisbon Centenary Half Marathon, marking 1.01:03 on Sunday.

On the women's race, the Kenyan Mary Keitany finished first with 1.08:47.

The traditional Lisbon marthon was renamed this year to evoke the 100th
anniversary of the Portuguese republic that will be on Oct. 5. The course was
changed, so there can be no comparison to the previous races.

More than 17,000 people took part in the Centenary Half Marathon. On the men's
race, the runner-up was Josphat Kiprono Menjo, from Kenya, 39 seconds behind
Tola, and Francis Kiprop, also a Kenyan, 44 seconds after the winner.

On the women's race, the runner-up was the Alice Timbilili also from Kenya.
