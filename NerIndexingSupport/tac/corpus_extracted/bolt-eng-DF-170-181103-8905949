Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., is so upset about Republican spending cuts that he's brought out the big guns: Accusing the GOP of being so heartless they would de-fund the National Endowment for the Humanities, which underwrites a cowboy poetry festival in his state:

The mean-spirited bill, H.R. 1, eliminates National Public Broadcasting," said Reid in a floor speech. "It eliminates the National Endowment of the Humanities, National Endowment of the Arts. These programs create jobs. The National Endowment of the Humanities is the reason we have in northern Nevada every January a cowboy poetry festival. Had that program not been around, the tens of thousands of people who come there every year would not exist.
