More hope!...More change!

\Last week, a senior McDonald's official informed the Department of Health and Human Services that the restaurant chain's insurer won't meet a 2011 requirement to spend at least 80% to 85% of its premium revenue on medical care. \

So McDonalds is charging too much for insurance? That means instead of dropping rates they cancel the coverage?

$ 14.00 a week, how much lower should they have to go?

Low enough to stay within the law.
And $14/wk is $56/mo for 2,000 MAX per year of coverage.

This all kinda looks like special interest lobbying to me.

no, the cost of administering the program is higher than normal due to employee turnover, and most employees don't make that many claims against it. this health care law is about the most poorly crafted piece of legislation in the nation's history. a bunch of grandstanding asshats pushed it through, and they had, and have, no idea what they were doing.

And if they can't? They offer insurance when most other restaurants do not... I had a mini plan at one employer when I was going through school (no parent to provide insurance). If I remember correctly the cap was 15 grand a year I paid 20 something a week. I had a problem with kidney/bladder infections and ended up in the Urgent Cares several times a yearthe mini plan paid out a heck of a lot more than the grand I paid a year and a lot more than I could have ever afforded to pay. I think I would rather have that than nothing at all.

Ohh I predicted pretty much how the Healthcare reform would work out before debate even started.
It would be something that would benefit the health ins/care industry.

And McDonalds just needs to work smarter and increase efficiencies in their insurance administration business.
Remember they are in the business of rapid employee turnover. So they should play by the rules for an employer of that type.

Again I think this is special interest lobbying.
 
 
I wonder... did McDonalds insurance division lose money in the market drop?

are colleges in the business of high turnover? their plans aren't going to meet this standard either. mcdonald's doesn't administer the plan, btw, their insurance co does.
 
 
 
Insurers say dozens of other employers could find themselves in the same situation as McDonald's. Aetna Inc., one of the largest sellers of mini-med plans, provides the plans to Home Depot Inc., Disney Worldwide Services, CVS Caremark Corp., Staples Inc. and Blockbuster Inc., among others, according to an Aetna client list obtained by the Journal. Aetna also covers AmeriCorps teaching-program sponsors, who are required by law to make health coverage available.
 
If I remember right, Caterpillar, AT&T, and Valero are also planning on reducing their health plans because of this law. The way it's playing out so far, I don't think Obama will be able to spin it as a net positive in 2012.

I have a bit of trouble fitting that last sentence in with McDonalds rationalle. Low spending on claims means more profit?

Yeah it does they don't pay the 80% for claims like they should.
With all those McDonalds employees and low payouts someone is making a shipload of money.

what part of mcdonald's doesn't self insure are you failing to get?

from the link:

Officials said McDonald's would probably have to hit the 85% figure, which applies to larger group plans. Its insurer, BCS Insurance Group of Oak Brook Terrace, Ill., declined to comment.
 
 
 
Benefit consultants anticipate that, by 2014, most employers will stop offering mini-med plans. Such plans likely wouldn't meet the definition of adequate coverage for full-time workers. Under the law, midsize and large employers that fail to offer such coverage will have to pay a fine.

Until 2014, workers on mini-med plans would have few affordable alternatives for coverage. According to a survey by the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, workers without health insurance were three times as likely to visit the emergency room without being able to pay as their counterparts with health insurance.

"The packages maybe could be better, but for a start, they're quite good," said Jerry Newman, a professor at State University of New York at Buffalo, who worked under cover at McDonald's to write "My Secret Life on the McJob." He added: "For those who didn't have health insurance through their spouse, it was a life saver."
 
 McDonald's Says It May Drop Health Plan - WSJ.com 

How many companies will now consider "taking the fine"? I believe it is less than 10% of payroll. Many companies now pay two or three times that.

Unintended consequences.

But McDonald's issued a statement Wednesday denying that it planned to drop coverage for its employees and defending its benefit plans.

MacDonalds is destructive to America but this is actually about Obama and the heath care issue. Got it.  
 
 
That is what 0bama thinks
 
 
More proof that people on the left missed ALL the meetings about how the market works!!!

Fcukking hysterical..............
 
 
Maybe I misread here. According to my interpretation of the article, it seems the insurer is the one refusing to meet standards. Makes me wonder why McDonald's is the center piece. Please correct me if I misread something.

This is exactly what we said would happen. Obamacare is herding the masses into state managed, CRAPPY health insurance, and eliminating the quality private health insurance. It's bullshit and it will be repealed, hopefully.
 
 
Ummm......THIS is what you're complaining about? (taken directly from the article)

"Last week, a senior McDonald's official informed the Department of Health and Human Services that the restaurant chain's insurer won't meet a 2011 requirement to spend at least 80 percent to 85 percent of its premium revenue on medical care, the Wall Street Journal reported."

Damn Obama for wanting insurers to have to spend more money on actual medical care and not line their pockets. You're right, he really doesn't get it.   LMAO!

True. I am glad this is happening and am sure it will continue. Obama's goals of shutting down the insurance businessess, and putting ppl on Medicaid, seems to be working. Glad it is starting before Nov. 2nd so those undecided voters can see the devastating results of controlling other people's business and earnings. Capitalism, with it's peaks and valleys is the only system that can result in a prosperous nation. Not redistribution of wealth, otherwise known as Democratic Socialism.

I've heard the college plans won't make this either, for the same reasons. Actually it's a bit of an illustration why so many 'kids' choose not to buy insurance, until they obtain a job that provides it. They are willing to run the risk. Now parents fret like crazy knowing that it takes one serious incident to lead to thousands of dollars in med bills, yet usually it works out fine for the kids. Here's a bit on the college plans and whether or not they will get exemptions:

 Will College Health Plans Be Exempted From Health-Care Overhaul Law? - Health Blog - WSJ 
 
 
Is this really shocking? This is exactly what Obamacare was designed to do. Squeeze out all private insurance and make the government default.

I wonder how the workers feel about this.
 
 
I tell ya though, the more regular people this hurts, once the real consequences are known and felt, the faster it will be repealed,
 
 
Sounds like the high adminstrative costs of maintaining the plan are what drives the insurer to keep premiums at the current level. A high employee turnover rate like McDonalds will do that. Obama going to threaten Ronald McDonald House next?
 
 
I understand the purpose of the law, an attempt to keep employers and/or their insurers from gouging the employees with unreasonably high premiums. But...surprise! When setting the required ratio nobody took into account the wide variety of plans out there, the legitimate claim histories and administrative costs of those plans under different circumstances for different employers and the unintended consequences of the across the board 85% rule.

Gee, when have we heard about major legislation being rammed through without taking the time to do it right before? Dozens of times? Hundreds of times? You'd think they would have learned by now.

Math skills elude you once again. $14 a week for coverage. That means an $11.20 per week pay to hit 80%. So, if administrative costs run $2.85 per week, you can't hit the percentages.
 
 
 
McDonald's May Drop Health Plan

 
McDonald's Corp. has warned federal regulators that it could drop its health insurance plan for nearly 30,000 hourly restaurant workers unless regulators waive a new requirement of the U.S. health overhaul.
 

 McDonald's Says It May Drop Health Plan - WSJ.com 

 
McDonald's and trade groups say the percentage, called a medical loss ratio, is unrealistic for mini-med plans because of high administrative costs owing to frequent worker turnover, combined with relatively low spending on claims.
 
They may have to drop coverage because of the law-- this is what is being called an unintended consequence of Obamacare. They offer cheap insurance when many and now the payout will not meet with federal guidelines.
 

Actually, it's an INTENDED CONSEQUENCE. The end goal of ObamaCare is to destroy private insurance so that the only option is the public option.
 
 
 
 
 
Sounds like the high adminstrative costs of maintaining the plan are what drives the insurer to keep premiums at the current level. A high employee turnover rate like McDonalds will do that. Obama going to threaten Ronald McDonald House next?
 
Well that combined with the low payouts ?

 
 
Math skills elude you once again. $14 a week for coverage. That means an $11.20 per week pay to hit 80%. So, if administrative costs run $2.85 per week, you can't hit the percentages.
 
what I said before reduce administrative costs.
And lower payouts reduce administrative costs as well.

How big is this plan? How many participate?
 
 
 
 
 
no, the cost of administering the program is higher than normal due to employee turnover, and most employees don't make that many claims against it. this health care law is about the most poorly crafted piece of legislation in the nation's history. a bunch of grandstanding asshats pushed it through, and they had, and have, no idea what they were doing.
 
Ohh I predicted pretty much how the Healthcare reform would work out before debate even started.
It would be something that would benefit the health ins/care industry.

And McDonalds just needs to work smarter and increase efficiencies in their insurance administration business.
Remember they are in the business of rapid employee turnover. So they should play by the rules for an employer of that type.

Again I think this is special interest lobbying.
 
are colleges in the business of high turnover? their plans aren't going to meet this standard either. mcdonald's doesn't administer the plan, btw, their insurance co does.
 

That's why ObamaCare requires that the parents' plans cover their kids until the age of 26. Colleges have been protected via this cost shift.

So your advocating overseas job transfers, longer claims settelments and increasing benefit qualification periods?
 
 
You are making the mistake of assuming that MANY who work at McDonald's are under 26.

MANY are over 26, and do rely on these mini-med plans.

About half the employees in the fast-food industry are between 16 and 25 years old. The number of jobs in the industry is expected to increase about 17 percent in the next decade, while the number of workers in that key age group is expected to increase 0.3 percent.

 http://www.workforce.com/section/00/.../25/01/75.html 

Given the dismal state of the economy, more and more adults are competing for these fast food jobs - the elimination of the mini-med plans will harm them quite a bit.

It appears this is mostly a non issue since kids will be covered up to 26 by parents under the healthcare reform. What is the average age of McDonalds workers? Outside of headquarters that is which I figure is an entirely different set of benefits.

Are we talking coverage here for POS workers or corporate ones?

also does McDonalds contribute to the workers insurance costs? Or is this entirely employee borne premiums?

I just posted info that in 2007, half of the workers in fast food were 25 or younger - meaning half were 26 or over. Given the deterioration of the economy since then, the ratio has likely skewed more towards older workers.

Educate yourself before making blanket statements please. We are discussing hourly workers with limited medical benefits who often don't stay long. Hence, part of the payout problem. My comments were addressing your adminstrative costs reduction comment. I listed three ways you can do that. You didn't respond to any of them, but deflected.

McDonalds doesnt plan to drop  health-care  coverage for employees, said  Danya Proud , a spokeswoman for the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company, in an interview yesterday.

 McDonald's Seeks Waiver Over New Health-Care Law, Official Says - Bloomberg 
 
People seem to be missing this point.
 
They're infinitely superior to what the state dishes out. I work with people who have government health care EVERY DAY. People who can't get their teeth fixed, who wait weeks to be seen, who are treated like crap by their providers, who fight continually with the pharmacies.

I know what government health insurance is like, and what private health insurance is like. It's criminal that we are being forced out of private health insurance into mismanaged, BAD state run insurance.

Meanwhile, while you're sitting on your private insurance and preaching about how much better all the poor people will be now, government coverage is also being reduced by huge chops and sweeps. Flu shots aren't covered. Physicals for school aren't covered. Dentures aren't covered. Eyeglasses aren't covered. And while I can now enroll my grown children on my medical and dental, guess what? My dental only pays for cleanings now, and my co-pays have increased. That's GREAT!

Way to go Obama! You're fixing everyone right up, you loser.

Ok that settles it. Pale Rider has spoken and told us what is correct based upon his obvious wealth of knowledge and experience. We can all move on now. Nothing left to see here.
 
sucks when he is right though doesn't it?
 
Sucks for who? Certainly not for me. I'm not the one who thinks Obama hates America. I think it sucks for him and you if you believe that nonsense. Must be crappy to walk around all day in a country run by someone who hates you.
 
Yeah it does suck, but then we knew it when we heard his first lie, remember? Quote "I am not going to run for President in 2008"? Ever since then it has been one big lie after another!!!!

I'm not so sure on that Del, isn't this what Obama's end game wasuppose to produce? Pushing out the private sector where employees will end up on the government's list? This is just the tip of the iceberg....give it another 15 years and we are going to see something very differnt from today.
 
We can only hope!
 
Yep, socialists do hope for something different than capitalism. If you do not like what this country was founded on move, please. Just leave and live in a socialist country like the ones in europe obama and his fellow socialists love so much and see how much you like it. But stop trying to change my country.

Yeah, I do think obama hates this country. I think he hates what this country is, how it operates, it's history, it's traditions, and on and on. That's why the little shyster radical stood up there and declared he was going to "fundamentally transform America." Problem is the vast majority, and even many of those who the lying little prick duped, don't want what he wants to turn America into. Nope, we don't want a third world, shit hole, socialist, commie, big government, tyrannical state that pisses on the constitution, and in November, the shitty little moron libs and the mutton heads that still worship the fraud in chief are going to get their asses handed to them. Maybe then you'll understand just how small of a minority you stupid liberals are, and you can kiss this train wreck of a government health care debacle good bye. It's going to be repealed, and done over, the right way. Get that? The "RIGHT" way, and it will be done out in the open, not behind locked doors, and everyone will get a chance to READ it. The whole process will be a complete opposite of what the lying, filthy, scum sucking democrats did. Fuck them, fuck you, and fuck liberalism.

Medicaid benefit design is largely in the hands of states. You can wade through what different states offer  here  --in 2008, 35 Medicaid programs covered dentures, 44 covered eyeglasses, and while KFF doesn't break it down so far as to display flu shot coverage, Medicaid coverage of flu shots isn't rare. Yes, benefits take a hit during recessions as the Medicaid rolls swell and state budgets are strained; if that's your complaint, it sounds like you'd prefer taking control of Medicaid programs out of state hands (Medicare benefits, for example, don't ebb and flow with economic conditions). Do you want to see more comprehensive and less volatile Medicaid benefit packages?
 
 
 
From the OP linked article.
\Last week, a senior McDonald's official informed the Department of Health and Human Services that the restaurant chain's insurer won't meet a 2011 requirement to spend at least 80% to 85% of its premium revenue on medical care. \

So McDonalds is charging too much for insurance? That means instead of dropping rates they cancel the coverage?
 
How typical.

The policies that McDonald's offers have a higher than normal medical loss ratios because McDonald's employees tend to be younger, and thus make fewer claims, and they also have a higher turnover ratio, which drives up administrative costs. Your solution to this is to force them to loose money by charging less, which just indicates why you do not run a business of any type.

Are we talking coverage here for POS workers or corporate ones?

also does McDonalds contribute to the workers insurance costs? Or is this entirely employee borne premiums?
 
Does anyone realize this is optional?

Insurers are required to offer the policy, but no one is making the parents pay to keep their kids covered until 26. That means that at least some parents, perhaps most, will opt to drop their kids as soon as possible to save their own money.

Educate yourself before making blanket statements please. We are discussing hourly workers with limited medical benefits who often don't stay long. Hence, part of the payout problem. My comments were addressing your adminstrative costs reduction comment. I listed three ways you can do that. You didn't respond to any of them, but deflected.
 
I posted earlier about making the administrative portion more efficient so it draws less of a percentage.

You deflected as well from my line of thought to fearisms like outsourcing, inconvenience, etc without knowing how the admin system is structured or top heavy, etc.
 
They can actually eliminate the overhead entirely if they want, that will not ensure that the medical loss ration will drop below the legal threshold. That would actually require the workers to make more claims. Should McDonald's have a policy of spreading disease around the workplace in order to drive the medical loss ratio down?
 
 
 
What is the point we are missing?
 
The beauty of quotes is that questions like this are unnecessary. The point being ignored would be the one I quoted above my own text.

Then why do you keep talking about administrative cost like those are the deciding factor here.

The 80 to 85% figure is a requirement that that much of the premium actually be spent on health care costs. If a person buys a policy and never uses it exactly 0% of his premiums will be spent on health care. Obviously that is an unusual occurrence, but it illustrates that you are totally out of whack in claiming that all insurers have to do is make the admin side of things more efficient. This law actually requires insurers to pay out more in benefits regardless of how efficient the administration of the plan is, or how little their customers actually need the plan.

Would you allow the government to step in and impose arbitrary standards on your company using equations that require you to reduce profit in a way that has nothing to do with sound business practices? If not, why do you support them doing so with other companies?

I thought that was what you were getting at, but I wanted to be sure.

The real point here is it does not matter what MsDonald's intentions are, if they do not get the waiver they are asking for they will be forced to drop coverage for their employees because no one will offer a pan that they can sell to them.

Even DHS knows this, and is working very hard to exempt as many companies as possible form the new law.

 
Federal officials say there's no guarantee they can grant mini-med carriers a waiver. They say the answer may not come by November, when many employers require employees to sign up for the coming year's benefits.
The government is waiting for the association of state insurance commissioners to draft recommendations. The head of the association's health-insurance committee, Kansas Insurance Commissioner Sandy Praeger, said she doesn't think these types of mini-med plans deserve an exemption.
"If they are sold as comprehensive coverage, we expect them to meet the same [medical-loss ratio] standards as other health plans," she said.
 
 McDonald's Says It May Drop Health Plan - WSJ.com 

This tells me that while you are busy telling me I have no idea what I am talking about the administration is working overtime to make sure everything that people like me see is patched over and buried in exemptions. If this law worked the way it was intended no one would have to carve exceptions out of it.

To bad for them the states are the ones who make the decision.

So tell me, which one of us missed the point?
 
 
 
The 80 to 85% figure is a requirement that that much of the premium actually be spent on health care costs. If a person buys a policy and never uses it exactly 0% of his premiums will be spent on health care.
 
The entire point of the NAIC's current exercise (which isn't done, by the way) is to define what kinds of spending count toward the medical loss ratio. It goes much further than just benefit payouts; it'll include quality improvement efforts, HIT investments, fraud prevention measures, and so on. The draft blanks the NAIC approved six week ago have pages of these things. The medical loss ratio requires them to spend on activities and investment that increase value for premium-payers, not just straight benefit payouts.

 
This tells me that while you are busy telling me I have no idea what I am talking about the administration is working overtime to make sure everything that people like me see is patched over and buried in exemptions. If this law worked the way it was intended no one would have to carve exceptions out of it.
 
I realize this is probably the first time most people have ever watched the administrative rulemaking process in action but this is how it works. Congress sets relatively broad goals (in this case, better use of premium revenue) and leaves it to experts to fill in the details. For this one, that involves regulators in HHS, NAIC staff, and representatives of the business and insurance industries and anyone else affected by the legislation (as always, anyone can provide input on proposals).

But it's disappointing to the see the unfortunate effects of the 24-hour news cycle on people's brains--they're completely fried. Not everything is a crisis, nor is there anything wrong with exemptions or variations on a rule for plans with special characteristics. Regulations are not a patch, they are the law. Actual legislation is always too vague to be of practical use, since legislators don't possess the technical knowledge to to work out in excruciating detail how to make grand policy ideas work. Presumably somebody still teaches high school government classes.

Anyway, the law specifically says:
Definitions- Not later than December 31, 2010, and subject to the certification of the Secretary, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners shall establish uniform definitions of the activities reported under subsection (a) and standardized methodologies for calculating measures of such activities, including definitions of which activities, and in what regard such activities, constitute activities described in subsection (a)(2). Such methodologies shall be designed to take into account the special circumstances of smaller plans, different types of plans, and newer plans. What a failure! They said "come up with a definition of medical loss ratio that requires more spending more premium money on worthwhile activities but take into account that not all plans are created equal." That, as you may have gathered, is the part regulators are at right now.

You people need to relax. Stop flipping out over every news story. This reminds me of the  uproar  on here when it was suggested in the media that the uncapping of benefit limits would destroy mini-med plans. Guess what? It didn't. The regulations treated them as what they are: different than regular insurance plans.
 
 
"Such methodologies shall be designed to take into account the special circumstances of smaller plans, different types of plans, and newer plans."

McDonald's plan is NOT small, new or substantially different than many other companies with minimum wage employees. This is simply the government coming to grips with a bad law.

McDonald's is smart enough to send a signal to Washington while keeping its employees relatively calm in the interim.

In the end, without a rule change, McDonald's and many other companies will drop coverage.

What part of "take into account different types" is confusing you? That explicitly says that final rules need not, and should not, be one-size-fits-all. If mini-med plans will have valid difficulties with medical loss ratio requirements, that would certainly qualify them for a closer look. And Jay Angoff has said  as much .

 
In the end, without a rule change, McDonald's and many other companies will drop coverage.
 
No "rule change" is needed because there currently is no rule.

Balancing on the side of a dime there I see. There is a law and it will require a change to keep McDonald's in compliance. Be honest. You also know that this type of plan is far from different. Many corporation are using it. Hair spliting defenses are usually the playground of the losing debate side. Run along to the slide Greenbeard.
 
 
 
McDonald's May Drop Health Plan

 
McDonald's Corp. has warned federal regulators that it could drop its health insurance plan for nearly 30,000 hourly restaurant workers unless regulators waive a new requirement of the U.S. health overhaul.
 

 McDonald's Says It May Drop Health Plan - WSJ.com 

 
McDonald's and trade groups say the percentage, called a medical loss ratio, is unrealistic for mini-med plans because of high administrative costs owing to frequent worker turnover, combined with relatively low spending on claims.
 
They may have to drop coverage because of the law-- this is what is being called an unintended consequence of Obamacare. They offer cheap insurance when many and now the payout will not meet with federal guidelines.
 
It's not about what Actually Happens, it's about Good Intentions!  

And Beleive me, they had the Best of Intentions!...

I'm Certain that Obammy and the DemocRATS weren't Thinking about Trying to Secure Generations of Voters with yet ANOTHER Giveaway at the Expense of other People!

 

peace...

You don't say...
 
 
You want a real Heath Care Plan? Then look at the nations that have successful Health Care Plans. The ones that pay per capita about half of what we do, cover all their citizens, and get far better results. Of course, that involves creating a system that is not a for profit system.

Yes, we should go to a single payer system, such as Canada has.

A good Health Care System is not a givaway. It has to be funded with taxes, same as defense or social security. Other nations are successfully doing it, with far better results than the Health Care System we have in this nation. Far better results for much less money.

We have a good health care system. People are arguing the degree and costs.

Government doesn't have to be part of the funding.

Since other countries don't count the folks who die before treatment, results are skewed.

Rationing by government of these services is not a good idea.
 
 
Wow.

Guess all that rioting in Europe is just for the hell of it.

Something about raising the retirement age from 60 to 62 because they are going broke.

Now I'm sure their HC programs don't have a thing in the world to do with that doncha know. LOL

Does that change the fact that if a person is perfectly healthy, never goes to a doctor, and never files a claim none of his premiums are going to count toward the medical loss ration? I specifically used a single person as an example to avoid potential arguments about what is, and is not, part of that ratio. I am not talking about the average here, just one account.

All of which is irrelevant not only to my post, but to the entire discussion, since it is not the administration that is going to decide what the rules are for these types of accounts, it is the states. That was clearly mentioned in the article I linked to in the WSJ.

First, if the person receiving the benefits does not pay for them, it is a giveaway. that is true if it is paid for by taxes, or through charity, like the way Catholic Hospitals used to be run.

Second, why don't we do a side by side comparison between the health care system in any country you care to name and the one in the US to get a realistic idea of who actually has the best system. Or are you afraid to take the challenge?

A bad plan forms its first big crack.
 
 
Instead of saying hey this is the way its gonna be, they took the usual politically ( cowardly) expedient way out, they made it a non issue, well that is except for the po' peeples who neds da care...

you know, the folks this was supposed to be all about.......

Politically, long term, I see this as another thread unraveling as to Obama care overall. I don't think the rep.s will attempt to repeal OC outright, I think they will let it die the death of a thousand cuts and use each and every cut to highlight the bills, well, ‘poor construction’,
Like next year when these waivers run-out and this becomes an issue again, they will make sure the public knows, this bill needs fixing, again, it blows and they are going to starve it of funds or do whatever they legislatively it within their power to do.

The crux of this particular issue has not even been fought yet, not even close.

The low end market in this context is a highly transient one, admin. costs there fore are high, BUT the gov. mandated admin./profit spending restriction on premiums paid, to a 10-15 percentile, telling them you WILL spend more than 85% of every dollar on care or else, you see they legislated that the costs will go Poof and disappear, isn't that easy? And that's just [part of it....

Or that is they will force the ins.co. to bail on writing these policies at all, which is when uncle sam will get into the game, which of course is really the plan anyway.....

I have feelings from a purely political advantageous standpoint this bill will cast a pall/shadow of the Dem party for a decade, the gift that keeps on giving.

And all because the “O” farmed it out to nancy and harry and did not care to play ball with the other kids.

and this article Title for the NY Times piece up on mslsd......
As much as it pains me to say so, this headline is a great deal more, uhm, indicative of what went on
