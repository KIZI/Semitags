Pythagorean Winning Percentage

My question about this follows the paste.

<q>

What is pythagorean winning percentage?

Pythagorean winning percentage is an estimate of a team's winning
percentage given their runs scored and runs allowed. Developed by
Bill James, it can tell you when teams were a bit lucky or unlucky.
It is calculated by

(Runs Scored)^1.83
---------------------------------------------------------
(Runs Scored)^1.83 +  (Runs Allowed)^1.83

The traditional formula uses an exponent of two, but this has
proven to be a little more accurate.

</q>

The math is simple.

But what's the premise?

What do you mean, what is the premise?

In baseball, the goal is to score more runs than your opponent scores.
Over the course of a 162 game schedule, this ratio becomes pretty
well-defined.  Some teams score more runs than opponents, some score
less.

But of course these runs fall along a statistical distribution... some
games a team will score zero runs, some games 1 run, etc.  Similarly
for the runs they give up.  So just because, let's say, you outscore
your opponents by an average of 1 run per game, that doesn't mean you
are going to win every game during the season.

By statistically analyzing the relationships between a team's won-lost
record and its run differential, you come up with the above formula
which makes the closest fit between those two sets of data.

If a team gets fewer wins than would be expected based on their run
differential, they can be considered either unlucky, or chokers.  That
is, they tend to win blowouts, where they easily outscore their
opponents, and tend to lose the close one-run games.

This brings us back to the Cubs (doesn't everything?).  I'm looking
for it, but someone sent me an analysis of, looking over decades,
which teams had the greatest deficit of wins, based on their run
differential.  I perhaps don't need to tell you which team was at the
very bottom of that list.

I did find this in my old emails.  It's only emblematic of the full
problem of losing the close games... it shows the results of all games
ending with a final score of 1-0, from 1957-2007.

If you look all the way at the bottom, you'll see the Arizona
Dbacks, with a small sample of games, and then the Cubs with a much
larger sample.  You'll see that your Dodgers are second best at
winning 1-0 games.

Right.  Where do those 1.83's come from?

It's from a statistical model. The author determined that 1.83 fit a bit
better than 2.

I read this article; I think it was in Chance (the ASA journal, not the
gambling magazine of the same name).
http://www.amstat.org/publications/chance/index.cfm?fuseaction=main
but I couldn't find the article when I did a brief search. Statisticians
love baseball, because there are so many statistics available.

Right.  You asked for the premise, and I explained the premise.  You
didn't ask why it's 1.83, which is not the premise for the formula. As
the article you posted said, "The traditional formula uses an exponent
of two, but this has proven to be a little more accurate."

Bill James started with the simple 2, since it seemed to fit the data
quite well, but the statisticians later found 1.83 gave the best fit
to the actual data.

There are much more advanced approaches than this, e.g.,
http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=342 and
http://baseballprospectus.com/glossary/index.php?mode=viewstat&stat;=136 ,
which is sabermatrician Clay Davenport's imrprovement of the simple
Pythagorean model of James, called "Pythagenport".

A claimed improvement on the Pythagenport method is the Smyth/Patriot
method  called "Pythagenpat".  Here's more on that method, for your
reading pleasure. http://gosu02.tripod.com/id69.html

And here, if you want your head to explode, is a nice glossary of
Sabermatrician terms, models,  and measurements.

Any other questions?

I do understand that it was Blinky, not Mike, who asked this, and it
was to him that I was replying, not Mike.  I should have made that
clear.  But I didn't.  Sorry.

That 1.83 leads to answers closer to reality than other numbers do.

 

See, they agree.

Considering that Pythagoras did his best work before the founding of
major league baseball, why is his name attached to this formula?
Attributing it to an ancient mathematician seems to imply a deeper
premise than "one team wants to win more runs than the other."

In our last episode, <5pnaejFs53s ... @mid.individual.net>, the lovely and
talented Greg Goss broadcast on alt.fan.cecil-adams:

 

Only because the first version of the formula involved several square
numbers and so struck the inventer a somehow like the algebraic expression
of the Pythagorean theorem.  That, however, tended to overrepresent
high-scoring games and the exponents were reduced to 1.81-1.83.  For
basketball the exponents seem to be greater than 16 to produce the best fit.

There's a Wikipedia page on this.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_expectation

It says that one statistician found an exponent of 14 worked well for
basketball, whereas another found 16.5 was more accurate.

I was curious about this for American Football.  With the low number
of games played, 16, the R squared may not be that good.   Here's one
article on this: http://www.footballoutsiders.com/ramblings.php?p=4

This article ( http://tbeck.freeshell.org/fb/nflawards00.html ) shows
that using the Pythagorean model for football does the best job of
picking game winners each week.  But it's not showing the exponent,
making me think they may just have used the original 2 in their
calculations.

Ah, here's an article that claims an exponent of 2.37 is best for
football: http://www.pro-football-reference.com/blog/wordpress/?p=337

Some people who throw darts use a 2" radius to draw the circle around
where the dart landed - others use a 6" radius.  Which is more
accurate?

If they used 2.00 as the exponent, they will have more mispredictions
than if they use the best-fit exponent, which seems to be 2.37 at
least according to that one analysis.

I'm not sure I understand your comment about the darts... it doesn't
seem to apply to what I'm saying, which is about attempting to predict
weekly football scores based on team points scored and allowed.

Anyone can score a bullsye by defining the target after the dart is
thrown.

If you throw in something about Vapnik-Chervonenkis, maybe you can get a
math paper out of that.  Or at least a Numb3rs episode.

Is that show any good?  I've watched it once or twice, and while I
kind of admired its attempt to glamorize intellectual performance as
opposed to physical prowess, it seemed like they were just throwing
around some mathematical concepts in a very fuzzy-headed way.  I think
I did read that they have mathematicians working with the script
writers... but I don't really know how that goes.
