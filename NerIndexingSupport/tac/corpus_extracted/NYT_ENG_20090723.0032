CIT ON THE VERGE

A funny thing happened last week. After the government refused a
second bailout for the CIT Group -- the ailing lender to small and
midsize businesses -- CIT's bondholders realized how much they could
lose if the firm filed for bankruptcy and agreed to provide $3
billion in emergency financing. The agreement, finalized Monday
night, averted what would have been the fifth-largest bankruptcy
filing in the history of corporate America.

The reprieve is likely only temporary. CIT needs $7 billion just
to pay debt that is coming due over the next year. Even if it comes
up with the money, the firm's longer-term viability is still in
doubt. That's because the bondholders currently propping up CIT are
apparently counting on regulators to provide more government
support in the future. That's far from assured.

The government's decision not to offer a second bailout CIT is
defensible. The lender had not satisfactorily restructured its
operations since receiving a $2.3 billion bailout late last year.
Since then, financial markets have calmed down, building confidence
among regulators that the system is strong enough to withstand at
least CIT-sized problems.

While CIT may be too small to rescue, its problems hold big
lessons for the Obama administration on how to manage through the
ongoing recession and how to judge the system that is emerging from
the wreckage.

For starters, forcing CIT to fend for itself does not mean that
its business customers should be cut adrift. In today's tight
credit markets, many small businesses cannot simply switch lenders
at will. In a CIT bankruptcy filing, retailers could be especially
clobbered, since the firm provides short-term financing to some
2,000 vendors that supply hundreds of thousands of stores. And yet,
last week, when the government refused to rescue CIT, it had no
apparent plan to make sure those businesses would continue to have
access to the financing needed to stay in business.

Clearly, the administration must do more to ensure that lender
difficulties do not undermine small businesses. The Treasury
Department must ramp up a stalled $15 billion initiative to buy up
small business loans so that lenders have more money to re-lend.
The program was announced in March but is not expected to be up and
running until the end of this month. A separate $730 million
program that allows the Small Business Administration to guarantee
most small-business bank loans should be reassessed to see if it is
big enough.

The Obama administration must also pay close attention to how
the broader financial system responds to CIT's difficulties. As CIT
restructures, whole swaths of its operations could be sold to
competitors. The knee-jerk reaction would be to hail that outcome
as evidence that the markets are working to efficiently deploy
resources.

But if much or most of the business ends up at the few big banks
that are still standing (thanks in no small part to federal efforts
to rescue the financial system), the result would be that
too-big-to-fail institutions get even bigger. That implies, in turn
diminished competition, higher banking costs for businesses and
increased systemwide risk. That would be the opposite of what's
needed to rebuild a healthy economy.

NEW YORK'S PHANTOM GOVERNMENT

For years, there have been two New York state governments. One
is the public structure with its $131 billion budget and its
various lawmakers wreaking havoc in Albany. The other is a
dopplegaenger government of as many as 800 quasi-public authorities
that operate mostly out of sight.

These authorities run the New York City subways and almost every
major public building project in the state. While the state's
official debt is about $52 billion, these authorities are believed
to hold another $134 billion in debt. Yet too much of what they do
remains secret.

A bill that would finally require transparency and
accountability from this huge shadow government has been passed in
both houses of the Legislature. Gov. David Paterson should sign it
as soon as it gets to his desk.

Originally, these public-private authorities were created as a
way to make government work as efficiently as a private company.
They have managed to cut through bureaucracy and Albany's political
miasma to get many important projects done. Over time, the system
has increasingly become a patronage parking lot for New York's
governors, who have the power to appoint almost anybody to most of
these plummy jobs.

Assemblyman Richard Brodsky, a Democrat from Westchester who was
behind the authorities reform bill, has uncovered scandalous deals
and other abuses in various authorities. He once found plumbing
fixtures at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority headquarters
that cost 5,000 times the normal rate and publicized the sale of
development rights on the Erie Canal to a political insider for a
mere $30,000. (Once it was made public, the deal was quickly
canceled by then-Gov. George Pataki.)

The bill would establish an independent authorities budget
office with plenty of muscle to investigate, including subpoena
power. And authority contracts for more than $1 million would
automatically go through the state comptroller's office for review.
Perhaps even more important, board members at these entities would
have a new fiduciary duty to protect the authority's bottom line,
just like board members in most private corporations.

Paterson supported these reforms as a legislator. He now should
make them happen.

THE TRUTH ABOUT CARS AND CELL PHONES

We find it terrifying every time we get on the highway and see
all of those multitasking drivers racing along while they yammer
and text on cell phones, juggle hot coffee and a Mc-whatever or
attend to personal grooming in the rearview mirror. So it is
especially distressing to learn that in 2003 officials at the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration quashed a proposal
for a large-scale study of cell phone risks and withheld hundreds
of pages of research that warned about the dangers of cell phone
use while driving.

That information -- including estimates that cell phoning drivers
caused 955 fatalities and 240,000 accidents in 2002 -- was finally
pried loose this week by a freedom of information lawsuit.

The former leader of the agency told The Times' Matt Richtel
that he was urged by officials at the Department of Transportation
to withhold the research to avoid antagonizing congressional
appropriators who controlled the highway budget. They had made
clear that they wanted the agency to gather safety data but not to
"lobby" the states.

What we want to know is: Since when did trying to save lives
constitute lobbying?

The researchers had rightly proposed a warning to state
governors about the initial finding that laws mandating the use of
hands-free devices did not solve the problem. The conversation is
the distraction. This is a finding since confirmed by other studies
that show a driver on the phone is four times as likely to crash as
other drivers, and is comparable to someone with 0.08 blood-alcohol
content, the threshold for drunken driving.

Six years later, the Transportation Department advises drivers
to avoid cell phones except in emergencies. But far too many
Americans now consider phoning while driving to be standard
behavior. The department estimates that roughly 12 percent of
drivers are on the phone at any given time -- twice the estimate of
its own researchers when their effort to document the risks was
rebuffed.

NIXON AND KHRUSHCHEV, THE END OF AN UNSCRIPTED ERA

Friday is the 50th anniversary of one of the more bizarre
clashes of the cold war: the "kitchen debate" between Richard
Nixon, then 46 and Dwight D. Eisenhower's vice president, and
Nikita Khrushchev, the cunning peasant who at 65 had just finished
consolidating his position at the pinnacle of Soviet power.

Unscripted and often raw, it was one of the few times Soviet and
American leaders publicly vented at each other. After the brash and
mercurial Khrushchev was ousted, summit meetings became
choreographed shows.

Nixon, too, would fall from power, 10 years after Khrushchev,
but both men relished recalling a debate that went to the very
heart of the difference in their systems and beliefs.

It took place in an American exhibition at the Sokolniki Park in
Moscow, featuring all sorts of labor-saving and recreational
gadgets meant to showcase the American consumer market. Khrushchev
was the last Soviet leader who really believed in the superiority
of the Soviet system, and the exhibition seemed only to anger him.
He was even angrier about a "Captive Nations Resolution" just
passed by the U.S. Congress, to which he returned again and again,
each time more crudely. Finally came the legendary exchange:

"This resolution stinks," Khrushchev exclaimed. "It stinks
like fresh horse" manure and "nothing smells worse than that,"
he said, using a much earthier word than manure.

Nixon waited for the translation and fired back: "I am afraid
that the chairman is mistaken." Pig manure smells worse, he
explained, using the English version of Khrushchev's word.

In his memoirs, Nixon pictured his retort as a deliberate chess
move. He had read that the Soviet premier had been a pig herder,
and, he wrote, "Khrushchev would respect only those who stood up
to him, who resisted him, and who believed as strongly in their own
cause as he believed in his."

I believe it was more than that. Though he had risen in politics
in part through Soviet-bashing, Nixon was an ardent student of
Russia. After I wrote a series of articles about a dilapidated
Russian village, he had sent me a handwritten letter recalling
passages from Tolstoy's "Anna Karenina" in which Levin, the
liberal landowner, finds his attempts at agricultural innovation
stymied by immutable Russian peasants.

Tolstoy and other Russian writers, he told me later, shaped a
lasting fascination with Russia, which played a major role in his
relish to take on the Soviet leader and, I think, in the respect
the Russians developed for Nixon.

When the Soviet Union began to unravel in the early 1990s, I had
an opportunity to meet Nixon in Moscow. Then 78, with Watergate far
enough removed for him to treat it almost casually in conversation,
he was received by the Russians as a respected and historical
figure, and accorded meetings with both Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris
Yeltsin, then locked in mortal political combat.

Nixon's analysis of that struggle was spellbinding, especially
when he transposed it onto the American scene. "Gorbachev is Wall
Street, and Yeltsin is Main Street," he said. Or: "Gorbachev is
Georgetown drawing room. Yeltsin is Newark factory gate."

It was a very personal view from a man familiar with that
battlefield. He found an "animal magnetism" in Yeltsin, but his
money was on Gorbachev, in whom he saw a man who had fought hard to
get where he was and would not give it up lightly: "He likes
power. He intends to keep it. He is a fighter." Perhaps it was
because he saw something of himself in Gorbachev that he failed to
see that the Russian, too, would fall painfully from power, 10
months later as it transpired, and take the Soviet Union down with
him.

He also revealed something else about the kitchen debate: Not
only had he deliberately thrown his manure at Khrushchev's manure,
but he armed himself for the confrontation. Nixon said he had
realized that Khrushchev liked to use the shock value of crude farm
talk and had lined up retorts from his own rural past.

After the Soviet Union collapsed, there was a brief time when
Soviet-era archives were thrown open. Among the files I read was
the original Soviet version of the horse vs. pig exchange. The
earthy word Khrushchev used becomes "manure" (just as it did for
this article).

N.S. KHRUSHCHEV: "Please forgive me, Mr. Nixon, but I would
like to use a strong peasant's word to elucidate the situation.
Fresh manure always smells more."

NIXON: I also grew up on a farm. They used to say that pig
manure is worse than horse.

The transcript does not record the Kremlin's official assessment
of the exchange, nor does history say whether it figured into the
accusations of "voluntarism and subjectivism" for which
Khrushchev was ousted. But Nixon's retort did achieve an immediate
goal: Khrushchev changed the subject.
