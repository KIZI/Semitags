 
 
Unknown Civil War Officer?????
 
 
We purchased an old farm house built in 1805. An oval portrait has graced the wall of our home since we moved in 15 years ago. I have tried in vain to research this Civil war officer but to no avail. The executor of the estate or any of the remaining family members have been unable to shed any light on this portrait other than to say, it's been in the house as long as they can remember. We are the third family to move into this 200 year old farm house. The prior family took up residence in the 60's. So my belief is that this officer may have had some sort of connection with the original founding family of our home. I have enjoyed many hours researching this portrait. But, have temporarily exhausted my available researchable information. My thoughts on this Civil War Officer continue to side with the confederacy. The light colored uniform, the single 5 pointed stars on the collar, the black planters hat with multiple black ostrich feathers and what appears to be a golden eagle on the front of the hat. Could he have been a Cavalry Officer, a Staff Officer, a Chaplain, or a military cadet? One extra item of interest, I removed the picture from its oval, convex glassed ornately carved antique frame and it appears the picture was hand cut to match the frame. I am unable to ascertain if this portrait was part of a group photo or cut down to fit the oval from an original 16/20 portrait. Any help in identifying this officer would be gratefully appreciated. I would like to create a brass name plate and mount it to the frame if I receive enough info on him.

Oh how fun! Setanta should be along any minute now. If he can't figure it out I'll forward it to my brother when he gets back from Iraq.

Here's the pic:

 
 
 
Definitely Confederate...perhaps Lousiana. I've got a book with pictures of Civil War officers...I'll look
 
 
I came up empty...I'll follow this thread though
 
 
Thanks guys for the lightning fast replies. I've got a slew of Civil War books I've picked up over the years from garage sales and Ebay. But, to no avail.
So, he's back on the wall where he's been for years. One way or another we'll find out who this time honored soldier is.
 
 
@panzade,

I dropped off a link for danon to come by and take a look.
 
 
@VReaction,

Enter the name of the location of your farmhouse in this database - it contains every single issue of the Richmond Times-Dispatch from the start of the Civil War in 1860 until the end in 1865. The name of your city or town would be printed after the name of the officer if he had fallen in battle and may have been included anyway if he was decorated or otherwise distinguished in his life:

Have you checked with the local town clerk and historical society? They must have tax and deed records going back 150 years on the house. Once you have some names it might be easier to do the research.
 
 
@Green Witch,

Hi VReaction --- I'm Dan and from your description of the photo in the oval frame I would say it's original and from the time period, I have several just like that from my ancestors --- however, don't get your hopes set too high for it to absolutely be a Civil War person --- There were many home-made uniforms during that time period, especially on the Southern side. They didn't have uniform uniforms for a long time - even up to the end.

Will follow and take a look.
 
 
@VReaction,

You don't say where your 1805 farm house is located. Knowing the state and aproximate geographical locale might help in the research.
 
 
@danon5,

Oh, and in addition, at that time in history the person who was the photographer would and is apparent in this case (as it seems from the photo) hand touch the photo. He, the photographer may have painted the feather effect on the hat and it looks like he really hand painted the uniform - or at least he hand painted over the original. That's obvious. Also, there are no buttons - leading me to think the uniform was painted on the photo by the photographer - that was the normal thing they did in those days.

I know from the old photos I have that the detail is MUCH better than you have shown. Can you show the detail of the hat emblem at closer scale?? And, a clearer shot?? That would be helpful.

Thanks.
 
 
@danon5,

Hi Merry Andrew - long time no see. Hope you are well and enjoying life to the fullest.
Bedtime now, see you guys later.
 
 
@VReaction,

I'm going to go out on a limb here: I don't think that's a Civil War soldier.

First of all, Confederate officers typically had three stars on each side of the collar, not just one (although there was a lot of variation -- officers had their uniforms tailor-made rather than had them issued). And the collar pattern is not typical of Civil War uniforms, north or south:
 
More importantly, this soldier's uniform doesn't show any buttons: it's either a pullover (very unlikely), or else there's a single row of buttons that is hidden. Either way, that would be extremely unusual for an American Civil War uniform of either side. Also, the lack of epaulettes suggests that this isn't a Civil War officer's uniform.

Another thing: you say that the hat has ostrich feathers. I disagree. I think those are rooster or  capercaillie  tail feathers. Ostrich feathers would be "fluffier." Furthermore, even the flamboyantly attired southern officer wouldn't often sport ostrich feathers (or feathers of any kind) -- JEB Stuart being the most prominent exception to the rule.

What I think you have here is a photo of an Italian  Bersagliere . And considering the style of the uniform (single row of hidden buttons, no epaulettes), I am guessing that this is late-nineteenth or early twentieth-century.
 
 
 
@VReaction,

In general, the plume suggests a volounteer cavalry regiment which if I squint after poking myself in the eye, I think I can see the two ends of a cord on the front brim.
Does the star on the collar mean a Texas unit ? Most of the collar seems to be the yellow of a cavalry tunic, rather than the blue of infantry or the red of artillery. But the trim on the lapel seems to be a darker colour of red or blue, or even black was worn by some.
The moustache suggests he is a male or an italian/greek woman.
There are no visible chevrons or officer boards to suggest rank.
He doesnt have to be civil war. Grey uniforms were worn by all the states militia. Some northern troops had grey uniforms, and some confederate troops had blue uniforms.
Plumes were also worn by the NY volunteers amongst others....
That badge would be a positive identification if it was clearer.
It is not possible to go by regulations to identify a uniform as during war that fell into disregard and during peace time volunteers were notorious to change if the old uniform was more dandy.
I think he would have rank on for his photo if he had any and his uniform suggests he is not attached to a headqurters. He probably isnt an officer, an he looks too old to be a cadet but he might be training staff at a cadet facility, which might turn out to mean he is in effect wearing the school uniform rather than a military one.

So he might be a texas volunteer cavalryman, rank private, circa before the civil war.
 
 
Joe, of course, could be right. The similarities with the photograph he has posted are striking.

If it were a uniform of the Civil War era, it would almost certainly be Confederate. The rank insignia--a single star--is that of major in Confederate services. So, for example, the four collar insignia Joe has posted are for Confederate service and are, from left to right and top to bottom, Major, Captain, General officer (no distinction was made between grades of general officer in the insignia) and Colonel.

The hat would not be far-fetched for a militia uniform of the 1850s. The 2nd, 6th and 7th Wisconsin, one Indiana regiment and the 24th Michigan, all regiments of United States Volunteer Infantry, formed the first brigade, first division, first corps of the Army of the Potomac. They were known as the Iron Brigade in their own army, and the Confederates they faced commonly just referred to them as "them black hat fellers." That was because they continued to use the 1855 issue 0f militia uniform, which included a black "slouch" hat.

 

This image is of civil war re-enactors, wearing the uniform of the 2nd Wisconsin Regiment of United States Volunteer Infantry. They wear the 1855 issue militia uniform, with the exception of the hat badges, and that they no longer wear plumes in their hats. Many Confederate units went into service at the beginning of the war in their 1850s era militia uniforms. One South Carolina regiment simply walked up to and overran several batteries of Federal artillery at Bull Run because the gunners assumed they were Federal troops and did not fire on them. One Louisiana regiment at the battle of Shiloh was fired on repeatedly by other Confederate regiments (most had never been in battle before) because they were attired in their 1850s era militia uniforms.

********************************************************

On balance, i find Joe's argument persuasive. The only reservation i have is that i have not been able to find collar or hat insignia of the Bersaglieri such as is shown in that photograph.

I did find this collar insignia:

 

... which is similar. I have found this example of the hat with insignia most commonly:

 

... which does not resemble the photograph.

Quite a poser you've come up with for us here.
 
 
@joefromchicago,

Thats some nice research there Joe.
I dont think it is a Bersagliere soldier as moustaches or not were uniform and the lack of pockets suggests it isnt their tunic. But the hat is a dead ringer for theirs, so maybe he is from an Italian Volunteer Civil War unit ???
 
 
@VReaction,

By the way, i don't know if you can see it, but it appears to me that the photograph was heavily retouched. This became quite common in the mid-19th century, since, of course, the photographer wanted to sell his product, and therefore wanted to portray his subjects in the best possible light. Taken all in all, i think Joe has the best argument that this is a photograph of a member of a Bersaglieri regiment.
 
 
I think that he looks like Douglas Fairbanks Jr.
 
 
For those who are interested in identifying the uniforms in Confederate States service...

one horizontal bar on the collar=Second Lieutenant
two horizontal bars=First Lieutenant
three horizontal bars=Captain
one star=Major
two stars=Lieutenant Colonel
three stars=Colonel
three stars wreathed=General Officer, of all grades

I have mentioned this before, and i find it fascinating, that Robert Lee throughout the war referred to officers in Confederate States service by their authorized rank, but usually referred to Federal officers by their pre-war rank. During the battle of Chancellorsville, an army chaplain acting as a courier rode up to Lee and reported that the Federal troops were advancing on his right from Fredericksburg. Lee told him that he had just sent General McLaws (LaFayette McLaws, a Major General in Confederate service) to call upon Major Sedgwick (John Sedgwick, who was in fact a Major General in Federal service). Lee himself wore the rank insignia of a Colonel, which was the highest rank he had attained before resigning from United States service.

 

Note Lee's collar insignia--three stars. In Confederate service, that was the insignia of a Colonel, the rank to which Lee was promoted in Federal service before resigning his commission.
 
 
A final note for those attempting to identify American uniforms before the 20th century. Uniforms had what were known as facings. These were colored fabric on the "stand-up collar," the piping on the pants legs, the lining beneath the button and button-hole plackets and the cuffs of the sleeves. Those were:

Light blue=infantry
Yellow=cavalry
Scarlet=artillery (see the second uniform Joe has shown above, that is the uniform "blouse"--i.e., jacket--of a Captain of artillery)
Maroon=medical corps
Black=General Staff officer
Dark blue=Corps of Engineers

This applies specifically to the Regular Army of the United States (which is not at all the same thing as the United States Army). The Regular Army consisted of enlisted men and officers of the professional army, and the United States Army were conscripts. During the American civil war, volunteers who enlisted for two or three years, or the duration, were designated United States Volunteers. That included officers. So, for example, Ulysses Grant, who had resigned his commission, entered the service as a Colonel, USV, with his commission from the Governor of Illinois. He was subsequently promoted Brigadier General, USV, before being put back on the rolls of the Regular Army, at which time he was promoted Major General.

The Confederates did not slavishly follow that system, although their artillery officers almost always wore the scarlet facings. The first uniform blouse which Joe shows above might have been of a Major of infantry--and then again, it just may have been the taste of the officer who ordered a uniform from his tailor. The Confederate states service treated blue as a general color for infantry, and not necessarily light blue, if they made a distinction at all.
 
 
@Ionus,

 
Thats some nice research there Joe.

The lack of pockets is the only thing that makes me question my conclusion that this is a member of the Bersaglieri. As others have pointed out, however, there may have been some retouching of the photo. The tunic could also be part of an undress uniform, although I haven't found any information that might confirm this.

The mustache, on the other hand, I consider to be distinctly Italianate.

As far as I know, there were no Italian volunteer units in the American Civil War. The major wave of Italian immigration didn't take place until two or three decades after the end of the war, so there weren't the concentrations of Italians necessary to field all-ethnic units, unlike the Germans and Irish. The  39th New York Regiment  styled itself as the "Garibaldi Guard," but it contained more Germans and Hungarians than Italians. This unit  may have worn something similar to the bersaglieri hat  with rooster feathers, but it appears to have been a slouch hat rather than a round hat with a flat brim.
 
 
In fact, Joe's point about the Italians is very well taken. Napoleon III invaded Italy in 1859 to fight the Austrians (Magenta and Solferino were the bloodiest battles in Europe between 1815 and 1914), and then withdrew because it was not his intent to provide Cavour an opportunity to set up a pan-Italian republic. (A minor matter of interest, Irwin McDowell was the American observer with the French army in this campaign, and some historians claim that this is why he was given command of what was then known as the Army of Northern Virginia--ironically, Pierre Gustave Toutant [a.k.a. Beauregard] called his army the Army of the Potomac.)

Of course, Mazzinni and Cavour had ceded Nice to the French because they wanted his army to defeat the Austrians, leaving the Piedmontese monarchy (The Kingdom of Sardinia) in a position to accomplish the conquest of the entire Italian peninsula. Appalled by the casualties at Solferino, and sour at the realization that Nice had only been ceded so that he would break the back of Austrian military power in Italy, Napoleon III withdrew. By then, though, the genie was out of the bottle. In 1860, Garlibaldi, angry at but cooperating with Mazzini and Cavour, first landed in Sicily (against the express wishes of the Piedmontese), defeated the Neapolitans, took Palermo, and then crossed to the mainland and took Naples (he was significantly supported by the Royal Navy in these ventures). He was unable to defeat the Neapolitan Army with his volunteers, but by this time, Cavour had taken note that Fortune is bald behind and arrived with a Piedmontese army (many of them and nearly all the officers veterans of the Crimean War) and the Neapolitans capitulated. The Piedmontese has conquered most of the papal territories in their march south, but had pointedly avoided attacking Rome, which was defended by the French. Garibaldi wanted to march on Rome, but the Piedmontese would not cooperate, and he gave up the idea, met with Victor Emmanuel and then retired from public life.

These were heady times for Italians--not only were there many good reasons (at their estimation at least) to remain in Italy, there was little reason to emigrate to the United States, especially as, by mid-1861, new immigrants frequently found themselves in a blue suit on a train headed for Virginia within days of landing. The economic malaise of Italy, exacerbated by the "Great Depression" in Europe which began in 1875 landed large numbers of Italians on our shores--as Joe has pointed out, a generation after our civil war.
 
 
@boomerang,

You're a professional photographer, right? Do you think you could do an advanced image search on Google Images >
 http://images.google.com/advanced_image_search?hl=en 
> see if you get a match - I just don't know the specs to be entered for photographs, like "aspect ratio", whatever that is.
 
 
@joefromchicago,

 
The tunic could also be part of an undress uniform
 
I suspect he dressed up for the occasion and would have worn full dress.

 
The lack of pockets is the only thing that makes me question my conclusion that this is a member of the Bersaglieri.
 
I have been thinking about that, and there is nothing to stop it from being an officer's jacket if the rank was touched over. Pockets for enlisted men was the vogue well after the civil war, so the civil war era might still be correct.

 
The mustache, on the other hand, I consider to be distinctly Italianate.
 
Yes, photos of the civil war certainly show a bushy moustache was the fashion but it is possible he was of foriegn birth.

 
The 39th New York Regiment styled itself as the "Garibaldi Guard," but it contained more Germans and Hungarians than Italians.
 
This was the unit I was thinking of...you dont have to be italian to be in an italian named unit. There were no north africans in zoauve units.

 
but it appears to have been a slouch hat rather than a round hat with a flat brim.
 
The hat style with that amount of feathers screams bersaglieri...if it had a broader brim it would be closer to pre-civil war volunteer cavalry.

That hat badge is the answer, but I havent been able to find anything like it as it is rather distinctive.
 
 
@Setanta,

Setanta and Joe and all the rest - as far as I can tell after researching all my books, the man in the photo is one of a couple of possibilities: First, he may be an instructor at a pre-war school for students of an undetermined age and location. Or, second, he may be in a local voluntary unit of militia. There were many many many units of local militia in those days. They all had their own dress codes to include just plain clothing that everyone wore. And hats!!! My God, you can't count them. The only official uniform version of a hat that looked like the one in the photo was the Alabama Light Infantry. Other units had similar hats but with only a single feather. There are many photos taken during the Civil War showing men and officers in uniform with obvious civilian hats. Many of the officers had their own uniforms tailor made to their own imaginative design. Oh, well.

I'm sticking with the military school solution - he doesn't have the look of a person who has personally been in the midst of combat. He has the "teacher of cannon fodder" look.

Ahhh, I seriously doubt we will ever know. Unless!!!!!!

We need a clear shot of the emblem on the hat in the photo. I've several of the old oval photos from a bit later but close enough in time that I know the detail of the photos is really sharp in real life. We need a detail of the emblem. As for the jacket -------- well, it's quite obvious to me that the photographer painted it on the man's body - the whole thing. The person with the photo should be able to see that for sure. Setanta came up with a close likeness of the collar design - but, look at the star --- it's right side up on one side and upside down on the other. However, if the painter had a single example of the design to go by - given to him of course by the man in the photo - he, the photographer who painted it would flip the pattern over and make the photo as we see it today.

That's what I think. Many guys did this in those days in order to flatter themselves.
 
 
@danon5,

Oh, a final detail. The lack of buttons, etc on the uniform jacket could easily be explained by the fact that the photographer would have charged additional money for each additional item in the photo. Those buttons could have cost a pretty penny.

Good luck guys. I'll keep looking.
 
 
@danon5,

I know nothing useful about uniforms or Civil War stuff, but I dig the whole facial decor thing...

@Ionus,

I suspect he dressed up for the occasion and would have worn full dress.
 

I considered that as well, but it's clear that, whatever uniform he's wearing, it lacks the kind of distinctions that we would normally associate with full dress uniforms. That either means that there was some serious re-touching of the photo, or else the subject was wearing an undress uniform. In any event, there are plenty of photos of soldiers in the equivalent of "fatigues" during the nineteenth century.

All that is true, so of course I agree !!   But the collar looks formal, and civil war photos tend to show an abscence of a collar or collar distinctions. The collar seems to disappear on the jacket and the shirt collar protrudes in a lot of photos of soldiers in the field. This can not distract from this guy is trying to create a good impression and probably doesnt have anyone shooting at him. The star has also been painted over, it was bigger in the photo but shrunk during the painting. It also is not a flat badge, but has been stamped with raise portions. This makes it seem like a rank badge like setanta suggested. The trim line around the centre of the collar and the patches at the front would suggest rank. However, I cant shake the opinion that it is a Texas star not a rank badge. I base this on the broadest impressions of the photo/painting as a whole.
 
 
@Ionus,

 
... and civil war photos tend to show an abscence of a collar or collar distinctions.
 

This is patently untrue. In dress uniforms, there is a "stand-up" collar, and that collar will be colored, as are all the facings of a dress uniform, with the color appropriate to the branch of service. Field uniforms had lapel-type collars. Whether or not there were insignia depended upon the army in which the soldier served. In the Army of the Potomac, from the time of Joe Hooker's command of that army, each corps was distinguished by a badge, with first division of that corps displaying the badge in red, second division in white, and third division (if there were one) in blue. One corps (VI Corps?) had four divisions, and the badge of the fourth division was in green. In dress uniform the corps badge would be on the shoulder. In field uniform, it would be on the collar lapel. Many regiments, of course, joined without the badges, but these were generally sewn on after joining. The badge would not be apparent in studio photographs taken before the soldier's regiment was assigned to the Army of the Potomac.

In Confederate States service, fewer than 50% of soldiers were uniformed, and those that were usually had received their uniforms from their home states. As Joe has pointed out, officers looked to their tailors to provide their uniforms.
 
 
@Ionus,

 
However, I cant shake the opinion that it is a Texas star not a rank badge.
 

This is also not likely to be true. The Texas brigade of the Army of Northern Virginia wore no badges, and the troops from Texas which operated in New Mexico were almost none of them uniformed. The Texas Rangers who served in Missouri and Arkansas, until the death of Ben McCulloch at Pea Ridge, were not uniformed--just as they had not been uniformed while in the service of the Republic of Texas. McCulloch himself did not like uniforms, and when he was shot dead out of his saddle on March 7, 1862, he was wearing a black velvet frock coat, high collar, cravat and Wellington boots.
 
 
Samuel Reid of Louisiana thus described Ben McCulloch and his Texas Rangers: "... men in groups with long beards and mustaches, dressed in every variety of garment, with one exception, the slouched hat, the unmistakable uniform of a Texas ranger."
 
 
@Setanta,

I will explain more fully as you seem to only read what you want..photos of the civil WAR...as opposed to photos of individuals at home or in a studio...TEND to show an abscence of a collar or collar distinctions. Your style of writing has all the necessary components of a show off who thinks he is clever...I think the average Civil War fan is aware of everything you wrote as being rather basic information. Back to google with you and see what else you can come up with...
 
 
@Setanta,

Everything you wrote is irrelevant. We are discussing a volunteer unit or a school, and you say it is definitely not of a rebel of the Army of Northern Virginia or New Mexico or a Texas Ranger...whilst I understand the need to eliminate I thought we had moved on to more serious possibilities. Back to google for you....
 
 
@danon5,

 
it's right side up on one side and upside down on the other
 
I dont know if it is just the reproduction, but there is a ghost of the image that suggests the badge is original to the photo, and is upside down on his left in the original. Wish I knew more about glass photos....
 
 
@Ionus,

 
]All that is true, so of course I agree !!   But the collar looks formal, and civil war photos tend to show an abscence of a collar or collar distinctions.
 

That's assuming that this is a photo from the Civil War. The Bersaglieri, however, had a star distinction on their collars, as Setanta pointed out. Take a look at this:

 
Note the collar distinctions and the single breasted tunic with the hidden buttons and no pockets. This is a photo of a Bersagliere from World War I. I think the tunic looks very much like the one in the mystery photo.
 
 
@joefromchicago,

Now thats a very interesting photo....Does he have a stripe on his left arm ? The tunic is not that unusual though...it can still be before the civil war up to WWI. Should be easy.....  

 
The Bersaglieri, however, had a star distinction on their collars, as Setanta pointed out.
 
Agreed. But as Setanta also pointed out, so too does the rank of major. As I pointed out, so too did Texas volunteer units, at least before the war if not during.

For enlisted men, epauletes are in the same boat as jacket pockets, they put the date later than the Civil War. But an officer wouldnt have epaulettes or pockets so it still could be Bersaglieri based on the lack of a plastron or double breasted jacket.

If the photo is of an immigrant, or a relative of an immigrant family and they bought the photo with them because he was a decorated warrior after the photo, or any one of a million reasons why people hang on to things despite the cost, then the gulf between us and correctly identifying the uniform just got very large.
 
 
Your writing, Ionus, has all the markings of someone who makes shit up as he goes along. I know of no Army of New Mexico. The Texans of western Texas who followed Sibley into New Mexico were not a part of any formal, organized and named army. Snotty remarks about Google ignore, for example, that if one doesn't know who McCulloch or Sibley are, you can't very well look them up. Your silly comments about "volunteer cavalry," for example, are a classic example of someone making shit up as he goes along.

You really are far, far out of any field in which you have a plausible basis for claiming expert knowledge, so why don't you keep the cheap shots to yourself, and concentrate on the things for which you can provide reliable evidence? I don't consider myself expert, but am very well and widely read in these matters. When i began reading history as a boy in the 1950s, the nation was the gearing up for the Civil War centenary, and from that time to this, there have been literally thousands of books available on the subject here, which i doubt was the case in Australia.

I know of no instance when Texans so commonly wore a star on the collar that it could be said to be an ordinary distinguishing mark. The Texas Rangers were organized to deal with the Comanches and the nearly annual raids by Mexicans into territory claimed by the Republic of Texas, including two major expeditions against San Antonio de Bejar. McCulloch participated in the successful defense of the city against the first attempt, and in the operations to dislodge the Mexicans when they took the town on their second attempt. He also participated in the campaigns against the Comanches. As noted already, the Texas Rangers wore no uniforms. The habit of "peace officers" in the American west wearing a star as a badge of office came from the practice the Rangers had of hanging a Mexican five peso piece from the pocket of their coat--and the five peso piece had a rayed, five-pointed star on it. That's about as close as you're going to come to the nonsense you're trying to peddle here. What military school do you allege was to be found in Texas in 1861? What volunteer cavalry do you refer to?

I consider that Joe's identification of this man as probably having been a member of the Bersaglieri is the most plausible identification to date. Even the similarity of the hats worn by the "Garibaldi Guard" is not compelling evidence for this being a photo of an American Civil War era soldier, as they would have been wearing a dark blue uniform blouse--which clearly this man is not wearing.
 
 
@Setanta,

I'm in perfect agreement with Setanta ---

And, Joe - you have a winner in my books.
 
 
@VReaction,

You're certainly aware that in 1918 an Bersaglieri regiment was in the USA? (Together with 'Alpinis' and 'Royal Grenadiers'.)

NYT:  Italy's Fighters Pack Loan Meeting 

Getty image:
 

I mean, who's sure that the photo is from the Civil period?

 
We purchased an old farm house built in 1805. An oval portrait has graced the wall of our home since we moved in 15 years ago.

 

I'm quite sure that photo pictures someone from a(n Alpine) "Jäger" (= light infantry) unit. 'Alpinis' would be a second possibility (partly because non of the Austrian and German Jäger hats seem to fit.)
 
 
@Walter Hinteler,

Hallo, Walter!! Wie geht es Ihnen? Ich bin jeden Tag Ihnen die beste Gesundheit wünschend und Glück.

Danke zu der Information. Sie können, die Italiener sind. Sie sieht jetzt wie ein auf Ihrem Foto aus. Sie haben Methoden, sie Blick gut zu bilden.

Also, like the interaction with the site. You are certainly one of the best historians on the ether-net. Thanks for the input.
 
 
@danon5,

Ionus. Just finished reading one of your posts where you mentioned a "glass photo" ???? What the heck do you refer to? The period photos which were oval in an oval frame and the glass was 'rounded' over the picture were printed on paper!!! I have several of them in my attic - photos "on paper" of my ancestors in "oval" frames with "rounded glass" over the "paper" photo. I can say that the detail of each picture I have is extremely good and sharp.
Is this photo of the "soldier??" yours??? If so give us a sharp and detailed image of the insignia on the hat...........
To me - it looks like it may fit the image of the insignia that Walter showed us on the hats of the Italian soldiers.

All we need is a clearer image of the hat insignia --- Period.

Thanks.
 
 
@danon5,

Thanks, danon  
 
 
@Walter Hinteler,

don't know if anyone has checked the wiki page for bersaglieri - certainly some very fancy hats

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bersaglieri 

you may also want to check youtube for more modern bersaglieri hats - and action video clips of their bands.

that name sure is a tongue twister
 
 
@hamburgboy,

Hi hbg!! Yep, the sound of the name sounds like something cooked in an oven using hot wood coals to heat the inside........ hehehehe

Nice site --------- Thanks.

Early photography was on glass negatives.

Were you toilet trained with a chainsaw ? Your academic qualifications are what ? sixth grade ? How do you manage to fit shit into every post ? Twice in this one...clever.

 
I know of no Army of New Mexico.
 

army n., pl., -mies. A large body of people organized and trained for land warfare.

 
the troops from Texas which operated in New Mexico
 
You dont know about what you write ?

 
I know of no instance when Texans so commonly wore a star on the collar that it could be said to be an ordinary distinguishing mark.
 
Texans had unofficial stars all over their uniforms...belt buckles, cartidge pouches, hat badges, collars....esp when they were state militia.

 
I consider that Joe's identification of this man as probably having been a member of the Bersaglieri is the most plausible identification to date.
 
And when your opinion matters to me I will take that into account....or I will simply google to find out what your opinion is and ignore you.

If the man is a Bersaglieri, and that is the closest uniform so far, then we have an immigrant family bringing the photo from europe. Not too far fetched, but the possibility of it being a local uniform are far greater. If we can find a similar uniform, and particularly if the hat badge can be identified, we will know for certain. I am reluctant to agree that it is bersaglieri because although the hat is very distinctively similar, the hat badge, which would clearly indentify the unit, doesnt look like any bersaglieri hat badge I have been able to find so far. Whereas the rest of the uniform can fit many units, the unit badge worn on the hat will clearly identify the unit.

 
What military school do you allege was to be found in Texas in 1861?
 
How did you come up with 1861 ? Are you on medication ? I never said 1861.
 
 
@Ionus,

I have to agree with Setanta now --- you are an awesomely useless historian --- and --- obviously, narratively and scholarly irrelevant to this discussion.

Good Night and Good Luck.
 
 
@Walter Hinteler,

I think we have to match the pale jacket also. I dont think a proud member of a unit would accept a photo of himself in the wrong colour jacket. If it was retouched later at the request of the family, and was done incorrectly, then it could be anything.
 
 
@danon5,

When your opinion matters to me I will be devestated by such comments. In the meantime, as shit for brains would say, where do you get this shit from ?
 
 
@Ionus,

If you could spell correctly - I may be able to correct you.
 
 
@danon5,

You want ot be my spell cjecker ? Sure, can you start right away ? It is a boring, monotonous task best suited for a non-creative mind.
 
 
@Ionus,

It is obvious that you do need some help.
 
 
Danon, this is the same clown who, in another thread in which he was flinging his insults right and left, had the gall to claim that he had not started the name-calling. He never offers substantiation for what he posts, and he gets personally vicious with those who have the temerity to disagree with him. My advice is that you pay him no further attention.
 
 
@Setanta,

Yeah, I got that Setanta. Thanks for the upper.

We have a thing down here in Texas where I live - If a person who has been warned not to come onto your property sets one foot on your property - you can kill that person and there will be no consequence to the owner of the property.

Ionus, set no foot on my property.

Setanta, this guy reminds me of another shit for brains who actually lived in - or - around Dallas, TX. I will be on the look-out with my "Sweet and Sauer" --- that's a Sig Sauer.40 cal with a bunch of solid bullets inside. After I got it my wife nicknamed it "Sweet and Sauer" - God, don't ya just love her humor.

Oh, and I looked at the rectum retards stuff - He's a religious nut!! Look out!!

Oh, well. See ya later.
 
 
@danon5,

  If you get anymore insecure you are going to crap your pants. Arent you tough...you shoot trespassers... because you are a texan ? Are they not made of flesh and blood ? No ? Metal alloy perhaps ? And you think your ability to take human life proves your manhood ? I have taken human life and I think it proves my inability to be human, let alone a man.

Oh, and pray i dont take you up on your offer...I have represented my country in shooting....
 
 
@Setanta,

Damn ! You got through an entire post without the word shit ! How did you do that ? Did it hurt much ? You are not an original source and I know you think you are infallible but you have only proven yourself to be a egocentric blustering fool who knows how to google.
 
 
@Ionus,

 
You are not an original source and I know you think you are infallible but you have only proven yourself to be a egocentric blustering fool who knows how to google.
 

You were looking in a mirror when you wrote this, right?

The irony here is killer... but i'm sure it zipped right over your head.

Setanta, this has been fun - but, I think I'm going to watch TV and then take a nap.

See ya later.
 
 
@danon5,

Have a good time, Boss... say hey to all the Tejanos for me...
 
 
@Setanta,

Your response is "I know you are but what am I " ?

Seriously ???
 
 
@Ionus,

Oh no... i don't give a rat's ass what you "think" i am (i find it difficult to use that verb when addressing you).

You never, absolutely never provide any substantiation for the drivel you post. Then, you come into a thread in which Americans are discussing the American civil war, and attempt to pass off your ipse dixit bullshit (by the way, ipse dixit isn't "legal Latin," it's just good, old fashioned Latin). It's just hilariously hypocritical of you to accuse anyone else of making statements from authority--that's all you ever do. And there is no good reason for anyone to assume that you possess any authority, especially not with regard to the American civil war.
 
 
@Setanta,

I am aware that an old crusty fart like you hide during the Civil War but how much can you see from a cupboard ? So no-one but an American can know about the Civil War ? What about the Napoleonic Wars ? Only Europeans know about that ? Perhaps only fish know about the War in the Pacific ?

You are right to feel inferior and frightened. Your posts are full of superfluous fluff in a desperate attempt to show off. You see a post on history and cant stay with the subject but have to introduce the biggest load of unnecessary garbage that you can google. You think you are an original source and anyone who disagrees with you is handing you the ultimate insult. No wonder you like dogs, they dont try to understand the rubbish you come up with. If only people would realise you are God...how dare they...

 
by the way, ipse dixit isn't "legal Latin," it's just good, old fashioned Latin
 
This is typical...the only way you can win an argument is to create the other side, soundly defeat it and retire to masturbate whilst you still have a warm glow. You are a fool living in a fool's world.
 
 
@Ionus,

You should think seriously about taking a refresher course in English! And, spelling.

Oh, and by the way, how does it feel to be "alone"?

I go bed now.
 
 
@Ionus,

No, anyone could develop expertise on historical topics--however, when someone who is not an American makes statements for which they provide no substantiation, it is reasonable to challenge them. And your response to such challenges to is to indulge in hysterical, scatological vilification of whoever has had the temerity to question you. It's good to know one's limitations, but it appears that you don't believe you have any. Just today, a Swedish member challenged a remark i had made about Sweden. I didn't object because it is a reasonable assumption that the member is better informed about Swedish history than i am. Additionally, the long history of this member's posts here have demonstrated that he is well-informed on the subject.

There is no reason to assume that about you, and furthermore, you have made many questionable assertions about the American civil war. When challenged, you just resort to you puerile insults. That's just par for the course with you, though.
 
 
@danon5,

 
You should think seriously about taking a refresher course in English! And, spelling.
 

If you only type with one finger than you will probably mostly hit one key at a time. Most of us hit the wrong key on occasion..something you would understand if you could think fast enough to type.

Oh, and according to shit for brains, you cant know anything about it as an American because they language is English. Keep checking my spelling..I know your capabilities dont extend much further than that...

 
how does it feel to be "alone"?
 
I dont think you care...but what sort of dickhead brags about going to shoot someone ? Clearly you are just another little dick hoping one day to benefit from a penis transplant.
 
 
@Setanta,

 
when someone who is not an American makes statements for which they provide no substantiation
 
You are a clown...only Americans know what they are talking about ? Who invented the aircraft carrier, the landing light system for carriers, the vertical takeoff aircraft...who invented your dipsi dickit saying you are so fond off ? And who ever left a dictionary open for you to assimilate that statement should be hung. You spray things around with no understanding as to what is really going on...your friend the clown wants to shoot people...your dog is the only one who likes you (because you feed it and its a living)...you are doing really well. Which came first ? Your being disliked by everyone or your considerable personality disorders.
 
 
I've learnt here a lot... about early photographs (well, I've only a small collection of photographic plates), history...  

No, danon, I don't think it's fun since I don't really like this kind 'consolidated half knowledge' Ionus is spreading here authoritarianly.
 
 
@Walter Hinteler,

 
'consolidated half knowledge'
 
Perhaps you would be so kind as to give me an example...
 
 
@VReaction,

The Louisiana Volunteers had a Garibaldi Legion which converted to standard uniforms after the War started. Is it possible that uniform is red with dark blue trim ? This would mean the star is a rank badge.

Have you told us yet what state you are in ? That would help a great deal.
 
 
@Ionus,

 
Have you told us yet what state you are in ? That would help a great deal.

 

Why?

Is it the very first time you try to do historical researches? Not to bad but you've to learn quite a bit.
(The source/origin of the photo, that would be a help, not where a person is living now.)
 
 
@Walter Hinteler,

The photo has been in the house for sometime. A local historical society may know more, or there may be state resources that we could tap into. In the past, farms have belonged to the one family far more than in modern times. All this may be helpful, it may not but it wont hurt.

 
Is it the very first time you try to do historical researches?
 
No. Is it your's ?
 
 
@Ionus,

 
No. Is it your's ?

 

Well, if it is not your first than why do act like it was?
Making some fun here? Forgot what was taught in auxiliary sciences of history seminars?
 
 
@Walter Hinteler,

 
Well, if it is not your first than why do act like it was?
 
Assuming you are right in your critque, exactly how have I been authoritative but without knowledge and exactly how am I acting like this is my first piece of research ?

 
Making some fun here?
 
No. I assume you arent either...

 
Forgot what was taught in auxiliary sciences of history seminars?
 
Does that mean something in German because it is very vague in English.
 
 
@Ionus,

 
Does that mean something in German because it is very vague in English.

 

According to wikipedia "Auxiliary sciences of history are acedemic disciplines which help evaluate and use historical sources and are seen as auxiliary for historical research."

It's taught here in Germany (and the UK).
 
 
@Walter Hinteler,

 
According to wikipedia "Auxiliary sciences of history are acedemic disciplines which help evaluate and use historical sources and are seen as auxiliary for historical research."
 
And by tacking seminar on the end of it you think you have covered everything, that by being vague I can know exactly what you are talking about ? If you dont know, say so...but if you wish to point out a particular error, do so...
 
 
This will be my final, definitive guess on this subject:

The subject of the photo is an Italian Bersagliere from the time period of the early twentieth century, up to around 1916 or 1917. From photographic evidence I've been able to find on the net and in my library, including a photo of a member of the Alpini wearing the same tunic, I'm guessing that the single-breasted tunic with hidden buttons and no pockets was of a type used in the early part of World War I by the Italian military. This would correspond to the hat, which was used before the widespread adoption of the French-style "Adrian" helmet in late 1916-early 1917. Most photographs (such as the one that Walter posted) showing a tunic with breast pockets are from the later period of the war, which suggests that there was a redesign of uniforms (not uncommon - pretty much every army in WWI underwent a significant uniform redesign during the war).

Tunics from an earlier period, such as the American Civil War, would often have no breast pockets, but they wouldn't have hidden buttons. There's a good reason for that: there was no need to hide them. Camouflage for line troops (as opposed to specialty units, such as light infantry and snipers) was simply non-existent in the black-powder era. Hiding buttons only became an issue when armies were experimenting with ways to make their soldiers less conspicuous on the battlefield (other countries at that time would hide the buttons behind cloth coverings).

Et finalement, on trouve dans le  site du Musée royal de l’Armée (Belgique)  le photo suivant:

 

Note the collar distinctions, the tunic, the hat, and the fingers on the mannequin. I rest my case.
 
 
I suspect the glum expression on the mannequin's face is a direct result of having lost his fingers...
 
 
I'd say Joe has clinched it--Italian Bersagliere, lonesome and a long way from home. And a hell of a lot more rakish a hat-wearer than the mannequin. Anybody with pretensions to style in that period, up past WWII, wore their hats with a tilt, rather than square on their head.
 
 
@joefromchicago,

Joe, I agree with you - here are a couple of interesting photos, especially the first one from WWI -----------

This one is from a magazine cover picture ----------

Here's another from WWI with an American soldier -----------

Thanks Joe - You've done a great job.
 
 
@joefromchicago,

That uniform even has the join line across the front of the shoulder like the photo, a characteristic borrowed from Garibaldi style and era that makes it very distinctive. Remove the cockade from behind the badge and it is a lot closer to the photo but not quite a dead ringer.

I am not convinced the original tunic did not have buttons, but rather thay may have been touched over. I dont think we can say one way or the other.

Do you have an explanation for the coloured collar in the photo or the coloured trim ?

I am still trying to find a description of the Louisianna Volunteers, Garibaldi Brigade as there were far more Italians in New Orleans and othe major cities than has been recognised in this thread.
 
 
 From Louisiana Public Broadcasting 

 
Some cultural groups are found throughout Louisiana. Italians, one of the largest such groups, began arriving en masse from Sicily at the turn of the twentieth century. Most settled in rural agricultural communities, later moved into cities to start small businesses, and soon dominated the food distribution systems. But some rural Italian communities remain. One is in and around the town of Independence in the Florida Parishes, where strawberry farming persists and families make strawberry wine. Another rural, conservative Italian community is located around Powhattan in North Louisiana. (emphasis added)
 

 From the University of New Orleans 

 
Citizens of Italian descent comprise a significant percentage of South Louisiana's total population, and have had a tremendous impact on Louisiana culture, from architectural masonry to foodways to jazz and brass band music. In Independence, the proportion of Italian residents is conspicuous in that Italian-Americans outnumber any other cultural group. Many of these are first-generation Italian-Americans, their parents having emigrated at the turn of the century from southern Italy-Apulia, Calabria, and primarily Sicily. Italian emigrants to Louisiana typically arrived at the Port of New Orleans and quickly found work, often as plantation workers replacing the newly freed slaves. As soon as possible, they sent for the rest of the family, and children worked alongside their parents in the cane fields. (emphasis added)
 

********************************************************

I know of no "Garibaldi Brigade" which served during the American civil war. Certainly there were various Garibaldi brigades which served in Italy (ironically, they were Bersaglieri), and a Garibaldi Brigade which fought for the socialist government during the Spanish civil war of the 1930s.

I've found no evidence of any significant Italian population in Louisiana prior to the turn of the 19th to the 20th century. Certainly there were not enough to have provided a brigade for Confederate service, which would have required from 3,000 to 5,000 private soldiers.

 From Latin American Studies-dot-org 

 
The 39th [i.e., the 39th New York Regiment of United States Volunteer Infantry], the "Garibaldi Guard," recuited in New York City, was composed of three Hungarian companies, three German, one Swiss, one Italian, one French, one Spanish and one Portuguese, most of whose members had already seen active service. (emphasis added)
 

We have no reason to assume that the house referred to was in Louisiana. We have no reason to assume that the photograph was of a resident of Louisiana. We had a single post in which Panzade claimed that he thought the uniform resembled a Louisiana uniform of the Civil War period. Otherwise, there is absolutely no reason to assume that this photograph portrays a citizen of Louisiana.

Furthermore, we have no reason to assume that this photograph portrays a member of any military organization which took part in the American civil war. Moreover, there is absolutely no evidence produced by anyone here that there was ever an all-Italian military formation in Louisiana, nor anywhere else among Confederate forces, for that matter.
 
 
@danon5,

Thanks, danon, interesting stuff. Two comments:

Your first photo shows a young Benito Mussolini (note the mustache). Mussolini served with the 8th Bersaglieri Regiment during World War I. He would later adapt some of the distinctive features of the Bersaglieri as parts of Fascist symbolism. For instance, Blackshirt units often employed the fast march (really a brisk jog) characteristic of the Bersaglieri even today. A good example of this can be seen in Fellini's film Amarcord, as il Duce makes his rather theatrical entrance into the city.

Your last picture shows a member of the American 332nd Regiment fighting alongside Italian troops. I have a photo book ( US Official Pictures of the World War, printed in 1920) that has several pages devoted to the 332nd, which was the only US unit to fight on the Italian front (which, btw, also made it the only US unit to fight the Austro-Hungarians during the war). It was sent at the request of the Italians primarily to show America's commitment to its ally and for morale purposes. The book describes the 332nd as "an Ohio outfit."

I'm not sure how other people are making out details of the hat badge from that photo -- all I see is a white blob. I can't explain why the badge in the photo doesn't look like a Bersaglieri badge, but then I can't explain why it looks like a white blob either. Bad lighting?

 
Do you have an explanation for the coloured collar in the photo or the coloured trim ?
 

The color is the same color as the uniform. Or, at least, that's the way it looks to me.
 
 
@Setanta,

 
We had a single post in which Panzade claimed that he thought the uniform resembled a Louisiana uniform of the Civil War period.
 

After reviewing my books I found I was mistaken
 
 
There was a Garibaldi Guard. Maybe a few:

 
The “Garibaldini” in New York formed the Garibaldi Guard, the 39th New York Infantry Regiment that fought on the Union side with the same Italian flag used in the battle of 1848-49 in Italy. On the opposite side soldiers and volunteers from Italy joined General Lee’s Army. Most of them came from the Kingdom of Two Sicilies Army. They were prisoners of war from the Kingdom of Sardegna and were forced to move to New Orleans after the Garibaldi expedition in south Italy. There was also a brigade in the Confederate Army named Garibaldi but they changed their name in 1862.

 

 

There's the hat again
 
 
@joefromchicago,

Joe, you are correct again. I did see among the collection of photos a picture of Mussolini in what appeared to be a WWII uniform (or, of that time period) prancing along with a few officers trying to keep up. What a funny thing to see.

Great going guys - looks like we may be getting to a point of consensus.

Oh, and that "join line' across the shoulder could easily be the epaulet line "touched up" by the photographer. The original uniforms obviously had epaulets because you can see them.
 
 
That's interesting, Panzade, and, of course, i have already taken note of the Garibaldi Guard. However, your source is suspect. The "battle in Italy in 1848-49?" There were socialist uprisings in Europe, including in Italy, which were brutally suppressed by the Prussians and the Austrians. Many of the "48ers" (i.e., Germans who participated in the 1848 uprisings) fought for Mr. Lincoln--most notably Louis Blenker and Franz Sigel. But your source makes it sound as though there had been a single battle in Italy which lasted from 1848-49. Furthermore, it speaks about "Lee's army," and then says that the "Garibaldi" unit changed its name in 1862. Lee commanded no army, after leaving West Virginia in 1861, until he took command of the army before Richmond just before the Seven Days battle. After that time, he christened his army the Army of Northern Virginia. So if Lee ever actually did command a "Garibaldi Brigade," it wasn't for very damned long.

Furthermore, your source is making some confusing statements about the Italians it alleges ended up in New Orleans. The Kingdom of the Two Sicilys, commonly known as the Neapolitans, were the opponents of Garibaldi in his 1860 campaign in Sicily. The Kingdom of Sardinia (which is what i suppose was meant in that paragraph) had an army commonly referred to as the Piedmontese army (the capital of the Kingdom of Sardinia was, by then, in Milan in northern Italy). So the paragraph you have quoted seems very confused about who was who in that conflict. Garibaldi's campaign in southern Italy only ended when the Piedmontese army (from the Kingdom of Sardinia) arrived, and thereby outnumbering the Neapolitans, who had previously outnumbered Garibaldi's volunteers. Garibaldi himself finally recognized King Victor Emmanuel for his part, and retired in November, 1860.

Therefore, i find it highly suspect to speak about Italian prisoners of war who arrived in New Orleans, and formed an Italian Brigade. A standard regiment in Confederate service in the early stage of the war was from 600 to 800 men. Typically, there were five regiments in a brigade. This was more or less formally established by the Confederate States Congress, which had wanted to organize brigades by state--a plan vociferously objected to by Joe Johnston and Robert Lee. Until the summer of 1862 and after the battle of First Mannassas, Johnston commanded what was then known as the Army of the Potomac, and which Lee was to rename the Army of Northern Virginia; Lee himself led a failed campaign in western Virginia, earning the sobriquet of "Granny Lee," and became the personal military adviser to Jefferson Davis. The objections of Johnston and Lee lead to a policy in the Confederate States Army of brigading four regiments from a state, with a fifth regiment from another state, on the principle that this would spark a friendly competition.

For Italians to have provided an entire brigade of troops to the Confederate States Army, they would have needed about 3000 to 5000 private soldiers. Garibaldi landed in Sicily with just 800 volunteers. The notion that even a few thousand "prisoners of war" resulted from Garibaldi's 1860 campaigns is suspect.

On these bases, i am unwilling to consider your source to be authoritative (never mind that the author could not spell Sardinia--perhaps the author is Italian, which might account for the odd spelling).
 
 
For the career of Robert Lee, see R. E. Lee, Douglas Southall Freeman, 1934. For the controversy over the organization of brigades in southern armies, see Lee's Lieutenants: A Study in Command, Douglas Southall Freeman, published serially in the 1940s.

See also, The Civil War: A Narrative, Shelby Foote, published serially from 1954 to 1974.
 
 
@Setanta,

Here is an image of the cloth patch. At least one of them -there were apparently several different ones. This one could be "painted" by a period photographer to appear like the one in the photo "roughly" if looked at from an angle.

Joe - here's the photo of the Musso-trot............... Looks funny to me.

Setanta, maybe ehBeth told you - I'm a cousin to R.E. Lee in real life. To my knowledge, he was not the commander of the Southern Forces - but, you're right - he advised Jeff Davis who was the armchair commander right up until Sherman was marching north from GA. Then, Davis gave command of the entire Confederate Army to Lee - at the last dang minute. At least that's the way I understand Lee's role - may be wrong though - wouldn't be the first time.
 
 
@Setanta,

Appos for not giving the source set

 http://us-civil-war.suite101.com/article.cfm/italians_and_the_american_civil_war 

He is Italian by the way he spelled Sardegna
 
 
@danon5,

(All of the following remarks are based on several Lee biographies, but principally on Freeman's R. E. Lee, which was, of course, the "granddaddy" of Lee biographies. It was also hagiography, and made no effort to present the point of view of the Federal armies when describing operations.)

Lee resigned his commission rather late. He had taken command of the Second U. S. Cavalry in Texas when Albert Sidney Johnston left to go to California (there's an excellent biography of A. S. Johnston by William Preston Johnston, his son, who was also a "volunteer secretary" to Lee at Washington College--now Washington and Lee University--before the old General's death). He was granted leave, because of an illness of his wife (who was by that point in her life, virtually a constant invalid, with crisis episodes), and was in a hotel in San Antonio when the Federal commander in Texas, General Twigg, compounded an agreement with Ben McCulloch, and marched his troops out of the state--that was mid-February, 1861.

Lee returned to Virginia, and naturally enough, paid a call on Major General Winfield Scott, then the ranking officer in the United States Army. (When Grant was promoted Lieutenant General, it was only the second time in American history, Washington being the first, and until then only Lieutenant General in the United States Army, during the presidency of John Adams.) Lincoln had not been inaugurated, and Virginia's convention had not yet determined to secede. It is claimed by several reliable sources that Scott offered Lee a commission as Major General (which would have passed him over the heads of all other officers in Federal service, except Scott) and command of the Federal armies. Lee, if that offer were actually formally tendered, did not immediately reply. In fact, the substance of his reply was to tender his resignation upon the secession of Virginia. His rank was then Colonel. Throughout the war, Lee wore the rank insignia of a Colonel.

He was first commissioned in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and offered his services to Governor Letcher, but was soon invited to attend the Confederate Congress (which had recently arrived in Richmond), when he was offered a commission as Brigadier General in the Provisional Army of the Confederate States of America. He was subsequently fourth or fifth on the list of seven Generals produced by the C. S. Congress (General as in the highest rank available), behind A. S. Johnston, Joseph Johnston, and Pierre Beauregard (among others). He was the senior military adviser to President Davis, and apparently the only officer to whom Davis would listen, and to whom Davis would defer. Late in 1861, he was sent to take charge of an almost impossible situation in western Virginia (where forces and supplies were scanty, where many of the locals were Union men, and where he had three separate commanders to control, all of whom despised him and one another). His dismal performance there earned him the nickname "Granny Lee." He was then sent to the Carolinas and Georgia coasts to inspect and supervise the repair and construction of coastal defenses. He had the temerity to make white men dig for the construction of these defenses (which proved extremely effective), so he was then given the nickname "the King of Spades." He was not held in high esteem.

But Davis continued to listen to him and take his advice. The Confederacy always suffered from an obsession with an area defense. That meant that local officials and state Governors kept huge numbers of troops idle to defend them against unspecified threats. Lee understood how wasteful this was, and worked to correct it, although not with great success. However, he did convince Albert Sidney Johnston to strip the Gulf coast of idle troops, and that was the army which Johnston lead to the battle which became known as Shiloh. If Johnston had survived his wound, and that jackass Beauregard had not taken command, there was a real possibility that Grant's army would have been scattered before Don Carlos Buell could arrive. It would only have been a tactical victory and temporary, but if it had ended Grant's career (Lincoln was interfering and unforgiving) in early 1862, the effect would have been invaluable to the Confederacy.

In early 1862, McClellan began his peninsular campaign, and Joe Johnston felt obliged to abandon the Centreville line--leaving behind millions worth of irreplacable military supplies, including just about all the beef the CSA then currently owned. "Prince John" Magruder--so called for his love of amateur theatrics in "the old Army"--did a wonderful job at flim-flamming the Yankees, and slowing their advance, but the investiture of Richmond on the East was an unavoidable consequence. At the battle of Seven Pines, on June 1, 1862, Joe Johnston (whom i consider to have been a superior soldier to Lee, but whose clear vision made him a pessimist to whom Southerners were unwilling to listen) was wounded.

Thereafter, Lee took command of the "main army" of the Confederacy, renamed it the Army of Northern Virginia, and began the career for which he became famous. I consider him to have been highly over-rated. It was not that he did not possess the requisite skills, he just didn't seem to want to employ them effectively. Most criminal was his staff work--which was almost non-existent. Given that he made his name and his career in the old Army as Winfield Scott's chief staff engineer in Mexico, i consider his behavior to have been completely inexplicable, if not actually pathological.

He retained that command, and the respect of Davis, and continued to advise the C.S. President while he discharged his duties. After the war, until his death in 1870, he was the President of Washington College, and it was there that he related to William Preston Johnston and others his reminiscences. He did not exactly whitewash his career, but like the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles, he took no notice of his own deficiencies. He didn't need to do his own PR work though--Jubal Early, with whom Lee had always maintained rather distant relations, and who loudly and publicly criticized Lee while he served in the ANVa, became his hagiographer after the war, in a series of public speaking events lasting more than 20 years. In fact, it became Early's post war career. Lee remains one of the most fascinating figures in American history.

You are right to be suspicious of a white blob. It would be the best way to identify the unit however.

I have found this in my search, it may be of some interest :

@joefromchicago,

 
The color is the same color as the uniform. Or, at least, that's the way it looks to me.
 
The collar is a pale colour, perhaps yellow with the front patch making a middle trim line around the collar. The patch and trim are the same colour, perhaps red or blue or black as these were common trim colours.
 
 
If anyone wants to help, these are the units I am having trouble with :

Garibaldi Legion - one company of Italians - Uniform ???

1st Division New Orleans, Louisiana Legion brigade - Battalion of Italian Guards - Uniform - These had the 'Hat' and a red shirt

Defense Guards - Italian Guards (Major Della Valle) - related to the Battalion of same name ??

Wouldnt it be a bit strange if it turned out to be Major Valle ? What would be the odds ?
 
 
@danon5,

 
Joe - here's the photo of the Musso-trot............... Looks funny to me.
 

You should see the Bersaglieri marching and especially their marching band - that does look peculiar funny.
 
 
@Walter Hinteler,

Oh my, Walter. I can see that in my imagination now ---- made my day. Big Grin!!!

Setanta - thanks for the bio, I always had thought (from something I must have read at an early age) that Lee never had the drive or the heart to really go after the North. He was apparently torn inside at having his loyalty with Virginia and commiting to the South. That must have weighed heavily on him. I understand he had great religious convictions also.

Hey --- this is true. I personally met Gen Winfield Scott IIII while serving in the US Army in Korea - during '80. He was a gentleman and not over weight like I understand the first W. Scott was.
Also, it may be of slight interest, I met BG Stubblebine at Ft Huachuca, AZ during '78. He is/was the brother of Lee Marvin the actor. I had a whole new respect for Lee Marvin after learning that during the start of WWII he dropped out of High School at the age of 17 and joined the US Marines - serving in the Pacific until the end of the war. No wonder he acted so well during his "war flicks".

Back on subject - the original photo we see on page One was evidently taken indoors using an incandescent light bulb which has a tungsten filament. That's why the photo looks orangy/yellow and the shading of the clothing is hard to read. Maybe a new shot using natural lighting and a sharper more detailed image would help.

@danon5,

Well, I'm quite sure about the origin of the uniform in that photo.

It's not Dutch - and since they don't have mountains there, their "Bersaglieri" band is a bit different to the Italian original version...

@Setanta,

Set, a belated thanks for a great mini-history lesson
 
 
@Ionus,

Interesting stuff, mate
 
 
@Walter Hinteler,

Walter, I think 99.9% of posters to this thread are with you re. the origin of the uniform. The final question is - I'm sure - when was the photo hung upon the wall in the house with no name. And, who owned the house at the time it was hung during or so soon after WWI, or, later? Someone should be looking into the history of an Italian family who lived in that particular house at that approx. time. That would satisfy the original posters question, "Who is this"? If he could find the family - then there is another question, "Why did the family of the person in the photo leave the picture in the house?" The person who actually has the original photo and lives in the house should take it out on the front porch - one fine day - and take a SHARP photo of it ((not in direct sunlight)) and show us all some of the extreme detail that I know is there. Especially the badge on the hat. It was in my opinion overpainted by the photographer (which was normal in those days) but, could possibly give us a little better idea re. the design.

Thanks again Set.

Thanks again Joe.

It's been fun - and, hopefully, there's more !!!!!!
 
 
@Walter Hinteler,

Walter the music is to die for ---- however, they were not "in pedal" with each other !!!!! Damn, that must be a "step" ahead for the Italians !!!!!
 
 
@danon5,

Well, exactly that's where I would start my research: who put the photo when on the wall, and where did this person get the photo from.

That the badge might have been overpainted, I totally agree (I've some dozens of 19th century photographs of military persons which seem to be more a painter's work than a photo   ).
 
 
@danon5,

Well, they aren't really used to it anymore - it's nowadays only a "traditional" music band since the "Korps Wielrijders" doesn't exist anymore.

@panzade,

Hey... no problem. I highly recommend R. E. Lee and Lee's Lieutenants. However, they should be red with a bowl of grainy salt close to hand. For example, compare Chancellorsville, by Theodore Ayrault Dodge (the great American military historian of the late 19th, early 20th century--he was there for the battle; i also recommend his A Bird's Eye View of our Civil War for the best short history).

It's all very interesting. In the 1920's, when he was still just a lowly and unknown journalist, Douglas Southall Freeman wrote a very sharp critique of the military performance of the Confederacy. His two most salient points were condemnation of the area defense policy, and the strategic defensive/operational-tactical offensive policy. The latter policy is thoroughly dissected and condemned by two historians from (i think) the University of Alabama, in a book entitled Attack and Die, published about 1980.

The basic problem was the romantic attitude toward militarism in the South, and the apparent belief that they would win, or at least not lose, because they were militarily superior to the North. Therefore, they remained within their own territory, foolishly attempted to defend all of their territory. For example, a brigade of ab0ut 2500 men from Florida joined the Army of Northern Virginia, and less than a year later, they arrived at Gettysburg with scarcely more than half that number surviving. Meanwhile, 15,000 or more state militia and volunteers defended a state which the Yankees had no interest in. The first shots of the war were fired in Pensacola (January, 1861), and the Federal commander there retired to Fort Pickens in the harbor, after destroying the military supplies on the mainland that he could not remove. The United States Navy showed up, and thereafter, there was no further reason to do anything in Florida. One small expedition tried, half-heartedly, to invade the state, and were turned away. For the rest of the war, the Florida boys sat around slapping each other on the back, and eating up free rations.

Operationally and tactically, though, the boys would attack the Yankees just about everywhere they met them. This was extremely foolish, as the attacker suffers the most casualties, especially with what were then modern weapons. So, for example, in the Seven Days Battle, Lee (who did just about no staff work) attempted to trap Fitz John Porter's "Grand Division" (roughly a third of McClellan's army) north of the Chickahominy River. Because no staff work had been done, and because Lee was loathe to publicly criticize his commanders, Jackson was not lead properly on his approach march, and did not take part in the first day's battle. At the same time, Alvin Powell "Little Powell" Hill attacked at Mechanicsburg, even though he was not to have launched his attack until he had heard Jackson's guns. Lee did not interfere. He once told a foreign observer (it might have been Freemantle, but i'm not sure of that) that he planned the operation, lead the army to the chosen site of the battle, and then let his officers fight it. He told the man that when he had brought his army into contact with the enemy, he believed that he had done the whole of his duty.

Jackson spent most of the second day wandering around, because the guide who had been sent to him took him to New Cold Harbor, and not Old Cold Harbor, as was intended. The man was sent on his mission without written orders, and even got in an argument with Jackson when the latter realized that they were marching away from the sound of the guns.

In the absence of Jackson's intended flank attack, Porter's boys inflicted a horrible slaughter on the Southerners at Beaver Dam Creek. Porter had been begging McClellan to let him pull out ever since rains had swollen the Chicahominy River, which separated him from the rest of the army. He was actually in the process of leaving his position when the Confederates began their week of attacks. Essentially, he fought a series of rear-guard actions. As long as he was north of the river, he was vulnerable, but the near complete lack of coordination in Lee's army meant that he could post a strong rear guard, and hurry the rest of his troops on the retreat. Jackson finally caught up to the rest of the Army, after Porter had inflicted another horrible slaughter on them at Gaines Mill, before the arrival of the Army of the Valley to launch a sundown attack which drove the Federals off--but Porter was keeping his trains in front of his troops, and the Confederates were continually attacking nothing more than a strong rear guard who were punishing them severely for it.

Lee launched Huger, "Prince John" Magruder and Longstreet at the flank of McClellan's support line for Porter at the battle of Savage Station, but the attacks were sent in piecemeal, and Magruder shied from the attack (or so Longstreet claimed--either way, Magruder's career was effectively over), so that another completely useless slaughter took place. Meanwhile, Jackson, now moving with the rest of the army, participated in another slaughter at Glendale. Lee and company continually congratulated themselves on driving the enemy off, but they were suffering higher casualties than the Yankees, which they could ill afford in either the short of the long term.

Porter had two topographical engineers from the Coast and Geodetic Survey with him (the ancestor of today's NOAA), and they found fords for his army which his artillery and trains used to cross White Oak Swamp, without bridging the stream, and carried out in the middle of the night. Jackson arrived the following morning, and wasted the day bridging White Oak Swamp, while Porter's rear guard artillery played hell with them. Lee and his "staff" were entirely ignorant of the fords the two civilian engineers had found for Porter the night before.

By now, Porter had escaped, and all of the casualties which Lee's army had suffered were basically useless. But that was not the end. The Yankees set up more than a hundred artillery pieces on a low hill, Malvern Hill, and put infantry in field fortifications in front of them. Lee had one more go at the Yankees, and as Daniel Harvey Hill remarked, it wasn't a battle, it was just wholesale murder. Confederate artillery batteries would unlimber, open up, and be blown to bits in five or ten minutes. The infantry were mowed down like wheat before the scythe.

But Lee was a hero. He had vigorously and relentlessly attacked the enemy, and he had "driven them off." That's what the people of the South wanted to see, and he gave it to them in spades.

Lincoln constantly said he needed to find a man who understood the numbers. Lincoln didn't care if you won, as long as you attacked the Confederates relentlessly, because they could not support a war of attrition. He may have interfered too often, but when he got Grant--no kind of battlefield commander, but someone who understood the numbers--he let him have a free hand.

Freeman must have seen the light, or been tipped wise by someone that his thesis was not consonant with the great "lost cause" version of the Civil War which was so popular in the South, that many of its basic (and false) tenets have been accepted as the majority view of popular Civil War history. Freeman's R. E. Lee is superb scholarship, and it also completely ignores the basic suicidal nature of Southern operational policy. Those two boys who wrote Attack and Die fudged a lot of the numbers, but even if you correct their errors, the math is plain. The Confederates were killing themselves faster than they were killing Yankees, and they could not afford that.
 
 
@Setanta,

Set, I agree. Those days were some of the most confusing during the campaign. I don't believe that Lee would or did sacrifice his men unknowingly. His personal beliefs and vows were his downfall. However, even today there is confusion in the midst of battle. If you have been there - you should know. Tho less than then - it's the state of the art of war. Only the lucky survive intact and unscathed. I'm a firm believer that the side that puts the most bullets downrange will win the conflict - not the war. In war, I rely upon Napoleon B's remarks, "History is a series of lies that have finally been agreed upon. "

That's what finally goes into the history books.
 
 
@danon5,

Oh, and I totally agree about Lincoln's choice for commander of the Union Army. Grant was the "Patton" of the day - attack and attack and do not slow down - press the enemy and don't let them resupply. That's what killed the South. We did not have reserves to supply us with the staples to continue fighting the conflict. The south was starved into submission. (believe it or not). That's why Grant ordered Sherman to "sack" the south, even though Sherman didn't want to do that. It's something that our "Patton" of WWII learned well in West Point. As long as you have ammo - charge.

"War's Hell." (Sherman)
 
 
@Walter Hinteler,

 
Well, exactly that's where I would start my research: who put the photo when on the wall, and where did this person get the photo from.
 
It is part of the original expalnation behind the question. He also says he has exhausted local reseaerch which is why I wanted to know what state.

 
We purchased an old farm house built in 1805. An oval portrait has graced the wall of our home since we moved in 15 years ago. I have tried in vain to research this Civil war officer but to no avail. The executor of the estate or any of the remaining family members have been unable to shed any light on this portrait other than to say, it's been in the house as long as they can remember. We are the third family to move into this 200 year old farm house. The prior family took up residence in the 60's. So my belief is that this officer may have had some sort of connection with the original founding family of our home.
 
 
 
@danon5,

In May and June of 1864, from the Rappahannock to the James River, the Federal forces suffered about 100,000 casualties and detachments--killed, wounded, missing and detached for various services. Grant scraped together 105,000 replacements. In the same period of time, Lee's army suffered 25,000 casualties--killed, wounded and missing, and exclusive any detachments, which i don't believe took place. He received 15,000 replacements. From the time Grant joined Meade's Army of the Potomac, it was only a matter of time.
 
 
By the way, Napoleon's dicta about history are interesting, in a pathological sort of way. History was his best subject at Brienne before he went to the École militaire, and shortly before his death, he made a point of telling people that the King of Rome (his son by his Austrian wife) should be made to study history. He made a lot of statements about history, which are simply not true.

Take the one you've quoted to the effect that history is a set of lies agreed upon. That people lie is no assurance that their lies will be believed. Napoleon would issue bulletins after battles, which were for publication in France. The French weren't fooled, though. "Lies like a bulletin" became a prosaic statement about how untrustworthy a source or an individual were.
 
 
@panzade,

Nice find, panzade..I found it but lost it !! Do you remember the ref because I would like to go back there and branch out again. Sorry to be a nuisance.

Oops. Just read later post.
 
 
@Setanta,

Thanks Set - that's enlightening info. I noticed the quote in 'Bartlett's' one day and it stuck - reminded me of our foolishness in Vietnam. I still like the little devil's sense of humor and think I'll keep the quote. Thanks again.

Oh, and could you shed some light on something I read a long time ago re. the Napo - at "Waterloo" he was apparently sick and in bed?? That would have created a defeat for him regardless of the situation.

You should write a history book.
 
 
I don't know that he was "sick and in bed." He was not the man he had been 15 years earlier. He had put on weight, and he didn't have the energy he had had 15 years before. But more than anything else, he didn't have the officer corps and the veteran NCOs that had made the "Great Army" great. In 1809, Napoleon fought and won (more or less) the Wagram campaign. This involved an invasion of Austria, and the defeat of the main Austrian army downstream (East) from Vienna. The battle of Wagram itself worked the destruction of the army. Casualties in officers and NCOs were appalling. One light infantry regiment came out of the line in the command of its senior corporal. Many of the field grade officers who would in time have become general officers, and perhaps even Marshals were disabled or killed in the battle. More than two dozen general officers were killed. In the battle of Aspern-Essling, which preceded the battle of Wagram by about five weeks, the French had suffered more than 20,000 casualties, and at the battle of Wagram itself, well over 30,000 more. These were mostly irreplaceable veterans. Marshall Jean Lannes, arguably Napoleon's best battlefield commander (Napoleon himself was not great shakes as a tactical commander--his greatest skills were in recognizing and promoting talent, and organization), was mortally wounded at Asper-Essling, and died about a week later. Napoleon dismissed Bernadotte for his conduct on the battlefield.

The invasion of Russia in 1812 finished the work of destroying the cream of Napoleon's armies. By the time of the Battle of the Nations at Leipsic in 1813, although Napoleon disposed of about a quarter of a million men, they simply weren't the material with which France had overawed and conquered most of Europe, even before Napoleon made himself emperor. The winter-spring campaign of 1814 saw the defection of many of Napoleon's trusted high-ranking officers.

By 1815, the Allies had unwisely reduced the size of the armies they had in the field, and the Russians, of course, were not a factor in a campaign that lasted only three months--there wasn't enough time for the Russians to arrive. But Napoleon himself was not the man he had been. His great chief of staff, Bertier, who had made the grand campaigns of the past possible with his neurotically obsessive control of all the logistical aspects of a campaign was not available. So many officers had been left dead in Italy, Egypt, Austria and Germany. So many more had been lost in Spain, which had bled the empire white while Napoleon was involved elsewhere.

Napoleon could simply not rely on his officers as he had been accustomed to do in the past, nor could he keep all the threads in his own hands as he once had done. The English and the Germans hadn't many troops to call upon, but the Great Army was a shadow of what it once had been, and Napoleon could not coordinate and control it as he once had done, when he could call upon dozens of competent general officers and marshals. And the troops were not trained to the standard which, before Napoleon was even on the horizon, had made the French the best soldiers in the world of their day.

Wellington once said that the presence of Napoleon on the field of battle was worth 40,000 men. At Waterloo, that just wasn't enough. It was not the same Napoleon, and it was not the same Great Army.
 
 
@Setanta,

Interesting, I have been at the battlefield at Wagram. My "X's" family came from Leopoldsdorf - in the area. So I've driven the entire field many times. Good spot for the old style of combat - really flat, open terrain. Austria has had quite a few battles during their history in the same place. In fact the locals still refer to the area as "march field" where armies were moving around.

One day during the '80's we drove to a place close to an old castle ruins near the March River just north of where it meets the Danube and walked to the river. Across the water was Russian guard posts. My good friend Franz (who had fought in the German Army during WWII) led the way and advised us to not show ourselves because the Russians would take shots at us if they saw us. It was a good day.

Napoleon, while in Vienna stayed at the Schonbrunn Palace - so I've also crossed paths with the little guy. Really interesting place.
 
 
Napoleon's army of 1815 was one of the best he put in the field. It had the veterans that were recruited after 1812 and Naploeon had not yet introduced conscripted troops. They had a taste of the return of the King and they didnt like it. He had cavalry that was superior to the allies and yet he couldnt out manouvre them. He had several physical complaints and was being treated with laudanum ( an opium mixture) for pain and to aid sleep. This was not given in accurate doses and he spent the mornings ina stupor, inspecting troops and lazing around. As soon as it wore off by about midday he was energised and seems to have been a completely different man.
 
 
@Ionus,

I'm not sure about the French home country (though the guard national was conscripted), but all troops from German countries/departments serving in the Grande Armee were conscripted - from the very day onwards when they became French territory, at least [that's clearly pre-1811].
 
 
@Walter Hinteler,

You are correct about german territories, and in France but in 1815 Napoleon had not yet instigated conscription again. His political position was precarious and he was busy writing letters of peace to the major Powers. How would it look if he begged them for peace whilst conscripting a large army ? The King had political problems in dispersing the grande Army of 1814, so it had remained larger than he wanted. On the Kings return to power after the 100 days, he was politically strong enough to cripple Frances army to save money.

In 1812, Napoleon had many german conscripts and as he marched through germany they went home ! Then he had loses up till the capture of Moscow, and by the time all this is factored in, the retreat from Moscow in winter did not kill as many as popular history thinks.
 
 
The troops which Napoleon put in the field in 1813 were conscripts. The army which he took to the Battle of Nations in 1813 was young, raw, barely trained and inexperienced. Not many of the survivors of Leipsic fought with Napoleon in the late winter, spring 1814 campaign. Apart from the Old Guard, about 3,000 men at most, the bulk of the troops for the Hundred Days simply did not have the training or the combat experience of French armies in the period 1794--1809. Even before 1813, Napoleon was always a year or two ahead in his conscription; for Russia, he called up the "classes" of 1813 and 1814, and he was calling up the "class" of 1815 to fight for him in Germany in 1813.

Once again, the "cream" of the company and field grade officers, and the non-commissioned officers of la grande armée were lost in Spain, in the Wagram campaign and in Russia. He did not have the officer cadre upon which he had always relied. The Great Army which Napoleon took to Waterloo was barely a ghost of the army with which he had overawed Europe before 1808.
 
 
Napoleon started the Waterloo campaign against the Prussians "second" army. their best army was still in prussia and was to link up with the Russians. He had 60,000 soldiers from the King (more than the King wanted to pay for) and called up all previous soldiers. This made a total of about 260,000 men in various stages of readiness. He sent some to hold the borders whilst he took the best, a veteran army from previous campaigns of about 120,000 to fight the British and Prussians. He never relied on conscription for his forces in 1815 but he had hoped that a quick victory would give him the political leverage to restart conscription.

more to follow....
 
 
The point, which seems to have escaped you entire, is that the "veterans" you allege he used had been conscripts in 1813, and had seen little service, especially in comparison to the Great Army which he took to Wagram. You also continually avoid the issue of the utter devastation of his officer corps in Spain, at Wagram and in Russia.
 
 
In 1809, "King Joseph" had some veteran French troops at Talavera near Madrid, but the bulk of his army were Germans, Poles and Dutch. The main French forces were with Napoleon in the Wagram campaign. In 1812, of the more than 400,000 which he assembled in and south of Poland, half or more were Germans and Poles, or the troops of the Army of Italy, which had also fought at Wagram. The roughly 150,000 men with which he arrived at Borodino were French, while the Germans and Poles held the left of the campaigning area and the Army of Italy the right. The troops which Napoleon lost in Russia were primarily French veterans of his earlier campaigns. When he faced the Allies in Germany in 1813, he had to rely on conscripts.

So just what were these allegedly veteran troops veterans of? The defeat at Leipsic? The winter campaign in 1814? It is laughable to compare the army of the Hundred Days to the army which he employed from 1797 to 1808. You're just arguing for arguments sake.
 
 
The French army managed to maintain its loses in the officer ranks a lot easier than most armies of the period. In Britain you could buy a commission. In France you could rise up through the ranks based solely on merit. Every soldier liked to think that he had the baton of a Marshall in his knapsack.

You seem to think that every soldier who enlisted in 1797 was alive in 1808. France had severe losses of manpower and there was never a time when there were not large losses. It was Napoleon's style to break the centre because if you won this way you could negate your loses by inflicting a severe defeat on the enemy. Your attitude that experience came to an end is laughable. Your attitude that the army after 1812 had not recovered by 1815 is pathetic and shows ignorance on a Grande scale. I have not commented on the army of 1808 which was the arguably the finest French army of the period. For those who can read without adding nonsense from their own mind, I said the army of 1815 was one of the best. It should be obvious to even the dull and ignorant that statement does not exclude others.

Congratulations upon your success after all the recent postings you have miss uh er spelled very few words and actually have been attempting to use correct grammer. Damn, that's progress. I give you an A- at this point. Great going fella!!!!!

PS: Notice my erroer?? I would have corrected it except I had already "Posted it" --- Tiny Smile.
 
 
Say whatever you like, Ionus. It is certainly reasonable that officers and NCOs who served with Napoleon from 1797 onward would have been available in 1815--if so many had not been slaughtered in 1809 and 1812. All you're doing here is attempting to suggest you have specialized knowledge without actually demonstrating the case.

Your performance at this site in all subjects is such that no reasonable member familiar with your "contribution" is going to give you ordinary credence.

All you're doing here is demonstrating you have no specialized knowledge without actually even attempting the case. Your argument is that they never had loses before and there were no mechanisms to replace them. They had every mechanism required by a modern army. They had training schools, they promoted from the ranks based on ability and they had the same comparable loses as their enemies but better methods to replace officers.
The Fench army had nothing but loses, from start to finish. The break you attribute to post 1812 is imaginary.
 
 
@danon5,

Dont bother clown. Spelling is an over rated feature emphasised by those who cant communicate. Hey look, clown is a fool, but he can look up a dictionary !!

@VReaction,

The photo is definately not of anyone of the American Civil War period. I would agree that this is an Italian Bersaglieri of the World War-I era. The tunic style and cut, the collar insignias and headdress is definately Italian military. The upright collar and coat style imply this is pre-1939 era, most likely that of WWI vintage. The photo type and style as well as the large oval frame and domed glass mentioned is most common of the 1910-1925 era. These were usually made enlarged from an original smaller photo, thus the resulting darkened and grainy appearance that the artist typically would hand retouch to give some color hue and better definition.

@VReaction,

Unfortunately the photo is not of anyone of the American Civil War vintage. I would agree that this person is an Italian Bersaglieri. The headdress, insignia and uniform style is that of the Italian Military of the pre-1939 era most likely from WWI. The photo, frame and domed glass style mentioned was most common in the 1910-1925 era. Many of these were reprint enlargements of smaller originals thus the darkened grainy appearance results is common. The photo artists frequently would retouch to give better definition and/or some hand colored tones to make it more lifelike.

@LtFrederick,

What facts do you base this on ?
 
 
@VReaction,

Hello,
It sems to me the answer may be in researching the home owners names back to the civil war era (county tax records, deeds etc.) and researching those names on the soldiers and sailors system online. Hopefully you will be able to identify him that way, sounds like fun Bye, Duane
 
 
@panzade,

No, this is an Italian Bersigliere insignia and photo.
My Grandfather was in WW1 with this unit and I have an exact photo of him with this hat and crimsom colar insignia with start.

@boomerang,

I belive this is a WW1 Italian Bersagliere-special forces unit.
I have a photo of my Grandpa from Italy in WW1, and its exactly the same.
Hope this helps,
Mike
