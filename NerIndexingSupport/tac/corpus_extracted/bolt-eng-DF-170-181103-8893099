Pretty clever.
 
 
   

Why isn't Romney out there looking for land mines to step on??? I just don't get it!  
 
 
"Mittens" is Obama with an "R".
 
 
I agree with the premise of the site, Romney is closed off.

Special Report report foxs 600 pm show with Bret Baier ( I call him boy wonder or Jimmy Olsen   ) has a center seat segment, where in all of the candidates have come on, Romney? only one to refuse.

I hear you, but frankly I want to hear more from him, I'd like to see him take a grillin', the debates are a joke due to their set-up/their model= 30 second red meat blurbs etc. I want to hear him answer some tough questions.
 
 
The libs must feel they damaged Cain enough so they can start on Romney.

Starting to have flashbacks to McCain 2008 yet? I think the finger prints of his handlers and McCain's may be an exact match.

Huntsman made the site, he's a Republican candidate.

OHHHHH Huntsman! That explains it. He's the most lib of all the candidates. I'm surprised he's lasted as long as he has.
 
 
You know how at the end of a football game, if you're winning and you have possession of the ball with the clock ticking down, you just kneel on the ball..............?
