Good game so far. The Colts defense sucks. If they face San Diego or New England in the playoffs they are toast.
 
 
3rd time the announcer's said that the Colts are down by 4.

Score is 31-28.

At least you're consistent Holmes.

You keep saying we're going to lose.

If we do lose any during the rest of the regular season, no biggie.

We will be undefeated in the playoffs, and that's all that matters.

Not this year.

Go Jags!

Touchdown Colts!

Pathetic so called coverage on Wayne.
 
 
Like I've said before- there's game time and there's Peyton time.

Wait for it...

You sound like a broken record Dog.

You say that in EVERY Colts thread.

It's ALWAYS the refs fault, that's why the Colts are undefeated, you betcha!

Thats the problem with fans that have QB envy. I listened to that shit for 16 years when Favre was getting his ass run out of the pocket in Green Bay. Take it with a grain of salt.
 
 
The Colts sort of remind me of the Titans last year, only different...

After week 14, the Colts are ranked 17th in defense, 17th in rush defense, 20th in pass defense, 30th in rush offense and 1st in pass offense. Can a team ride one player all the way to the Super Bowl? History says not, but Manning may be the best player ever.

Yes, he may just be when it's all said and done.

But that's only because the refs protect him,, it has nothing to do with hard work and talent.

Thats like saying you would take 100 dollar bill over 5 twenties. They are both great, but different. Brady has more rings, but Manning is statistically different. You put Manning in Belichick's system running Weis' offense and Peyton wins 3 rings as well.
 
 
 
yeah peyton barely got passed brady when tom had reche caldwell and jabbar gafney, while peyton had harrison and wayne.

 

Considering the talent that Peyton has had, he should have 3 rings at least. However, he doesn't because he is like A-Rod in the playoffs.

I posted this earlier but:

 Peyton Manning - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 

Majority of his wins in the playoffs came from his SB year when they beat Rex. He was fucking horrible that year too.

Another record broken, besides Dogbert's whining about Peyton.

Manning could still turn out to be the greatets ever. If he wins a couple of more rings, then he surpasses Brady IMO.

Congrats to the Colts. That's amazing.

They have the Jets at home and the Bills on the road. If they play all their starters, its hard to see them lose to the Jets, and they lose to the Bills only if it is below zero and played in a snow storm. Otherwise, they're 16-0.

But there is something about them that makes me think they are vulnerable in the playoffs. I can see how the Chargers, Bengals and Pats might beat them. Teams that rely too heavily on the pass and play mediocre defense generally don't win it all. But maybe its different this time.

But have to factor in how long he has played.

Trevor Hoffman has the most saves of all time by any pitcher, but I still think Rivera is the best closer ever.

Manning has to be the MVP of the league this year. Without Favre, the Vikings are 10-6. Without Brees, the Saints are 8-8. Without Manning, the Colts are maybe 6-10.

I think they have to put some better personnel around Manning if he's going to win a couple more rings.

I f he only owned one record, then I could buy that argument. But he owns all of them, good and bad. You can't fault the guy for being thorough.

I think so. Ronnie Lott was one of the best safeties of all time. Dwight Clark was a great receiver. Roger Craig was a great back for that system.

reason I asked about Young, is he holds the record for wins AND losses.

I think Brady or Montana would have beaten Dallas in 92-94. Only reasons the packers won anything are Jerry Jones' self-destructive ego and Michael Irvin's nose.

I'm a Bears fan. I'm probably not a good judge of how good Favre is. that Fuckstain Dave Wannstedt never took that rivalry seriously.
 
 
Having watched a few Colts games this season I don't know how their fans can be confident heading into the playoffs especially with Manning's tendency to choke in the postseaon.

That's the problem with these best player ever lists. They never take the time or rules or anything into context. Every QB list out there is filled with QB's from the modern era. Joe Namath revolutionized the forward pass. Bart Starr was the best ball distributor that the NFL had seen before '56. Kenny Stabler led the way for guys like Randall Cunningham by showing that the QB didn't just have to stand in the pocket and take a hit. Thats just 3 guys from BAMA, there are examples throughout history. That is why I don't make lists. I just kick back with a beer and watch the game that I love and the players who make it great, no matter what Elvis thinks about them.

Minnesota has the best defense of the teams that will be in the playoffs but they can be picked apart in the passing game. If Brees is hot and they can run the ball, then New Orleans has a good chance of winning. Plus, I am not convinced of the Viking's coaches.

Actually, I think the Vikings have a good shot at beating the Saints.

 

Aye... they do. I still think New Orleans wins it all this year.

 

Minnesota has the best defense of the teams that will be in the playoffs but they can be picked apart in the passing game. If Brees is hot and they can run the ball, then New Orleans has a good chance of winning. Plus, I am not convinced of the Viking's coaches.

 

The problem with the Vikes is that if the passing game starts to fail, then AP takes the ball to pound town. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I think the Vikes are better than the Saints. Saints win a playoff game between the two though. If for no other reason then because the Saints want it more.
 
 
 
 
 
if the vikings and colts make it, I'm rooting for Favre for the first time ever.

 

Can the Super Bowl end in a tie?

 

Nope. If it happened John Madden's head would implode, especially if it were a game involving Brett Favre.

 

Dammit...

Well that's the only way that game can conclude without me throwing up at least a little bit.

a New Englander has to root for Favre in that game. Bennedict Vinatierri, and time for a commercial Manning, come on, Art.

that'd be cool. I like Reggie Bush. I wish he had more playing time.

 

I like him too... I wonder if he could be a feature back on another team though I doubt his body could up to that.

14-0

Another record broken, besides Dogbert's whining about Peyton.

23 wins in a row, NFL Record.

 

Why did the Jaguars lose?

They didn't have Peyton.

I'm a Charger fan.....have been since 77'.

I'm happy with the QB we have now [Rivers] but we could have had Peyton.

Ryan Leaf just didn't work out the way they thought....[heh, heh, still have his jersey hanging in my closet]
 
 
Ryan Leaf!
