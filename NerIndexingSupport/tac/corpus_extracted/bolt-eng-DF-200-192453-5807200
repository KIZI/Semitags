Are you for or against fox hunting, and do you live in a town/city or in the countryside? I am trying to get a better idea of the spread of people who support fox hunting or not.
 
 
Against, and I live in the countryside

Spoiler:
Brighton is my nearest city, which is why it's my 'location' on here; no one would have a clue whereabouts I was if I listed my village :')
 
 
For it, live in the countryside and have done my whole life. Apart from 8 months in a city centre (which was pretty awesome!)
 
 
Against. Without question.

oh I got negged o.o
 
 
No town people yet, maybe they arent as good at getting up in the morning as us country folk  
Thats a joke btw, before anyone complains about it.
 
 
I live in real hunting, fishing and shooting country. I understand that in managing the countryside, certain animals have to be controlled and can be real pests. In any animal husbandry scheme, there are times when animals need to be killed.
But to make it into a game???
"Well, we have to kill it anyway so we might as well have some fun." It's what this does to the people who take part that bothers me.

And they dont need to be killed as much as fox hunters would have everyone believe...
 
 
Strongly against. I live in a city but we have our local lil fox. No one around my area minds him  .

How about I let numerous viscious dogs chase you then tear you limb from limb? Disgusting. It sickens me to see little girls talking about it as a sport.
 
 
Strongly against I live in a town, it's not a sport it's disgusting behaviour that shouldn't be encouraged.
 
 
What kind of sick weirdos smear the blood of an animal they've just seen ripped to pieces over the faces of their own children. For that and many other reasons: countryside, against.

Blooding is no longer practised, sorry to burst your bubble.
 
 
Officially, perhaps.

Well I've been at a few hunts, not been on them cos I dont have a horse, and I have never once seen anyone do or even mention it. Maybe some people still want to do it, but not around here anyway.
 
 
There should be another option

I live in the countryside, and strongly dislike foxhunting. I would never do it myself, and see it as beneath me.

But I don't have the right to enforce that view upon others. It infuriates me that the labour government, for no reason other than class hatred and spite attacked a culture that they disagree with and banned it.

So, I live in the countryside, and oppose fox hunting. But for me the right to culture, history and freedom to continue the traditions of communities, households and individuals trumps my individual distain for the sport.

The only reason fox hunting is banned and greyhound racing, or horse racing, or any other sport based around the exploitation of animals is allowed to continue was the background of those who took part in the sport/game/indifferent beating of animals for monetary gain.

And as such i oppose the hunting ban
 
 
I live in the country where some of my friends frequenty hunt, I understand foxes can be pests when owning livestock but I think having hounds tear them apart as a hobby is disgusting. I have no problem with them being shot when on a farmer's land though, for example.

Why the neg rep? Am I not entitled to an opinion?
 
 
Don't have an opinion either way. People should be free to choose; I live in the country.

Sorry, there is no basis for the assumption that that was the motive behind the bill. The vast majority of the people supporting the bill were doing so on the basis of common humanity - you don't cause unneccesary suffering to any living thing and certainly not for fun.
As anyone who lives in a hunting area will know, it is not a "toff's" sport; the class issue is irrelevant.
 
 
For hunting - people from the town don't realise the pain that foxes cause. I live on a farm and the foxes are a constant pain terrorises our livestock and have killed so many of our chickens. Also, the hounds do not maul the fox - they simply grab it and then it is shot by the hunt.
I can understand why people are against it, but really it's the city dwellers that make the decisions and they don't know what it's like living with foxes all the time.

I live in Devon btw!! Proper countryside - my nearest neighbour is about a mile away.
 
 
Against, I live in Scarborough, so I suppose I'm kind of countryside even though I live in a town, as there are local hunts, lots of farms etc. I think farmers have every right to shoot the fox that is eating their chickens, but to chase it with dogs and rip it to shreds for fun. No thank you.

How can it be shot straight away when there are dogs in the way? A hunt is not a humane way of killing foxes. Shoot the foxes, protect chickens, hunting is not a terribly successful way of killing foxes anyway.
 
 
I support it 100% and live in the countryside

The dogs are often trained so that they don't maul it to pieces and then leave it alone because people did recognise that it was inhumane for the dogs to kill it. This is on the hunts that I've been on and understand from friends that their hunts are the same. The foxes can break the wire and we are not permitted to shoot the fox and hunting is more successful than some methods of killing foxes and a sport which provides some use.

If you're not allowed to shoot foxes then how would you kill them in a hunt?  
 
 
I'm against it, and I live in a very small town in the middle of Lincolnshire, so I put countryside.

I genuinely do not see the point in ripping a fox to shreds; by all means grab a horse and go chasing around the countryside if you will, but there's no need to kill it in such a violent way.

Why do you support it? If we ignore the fact that an animal is being ripped to bits for amusement which seems barbaric at best, where is the challenge? ~40 people with horses, quad bikes and 2 way radios, 10-20 dogs vs one fox? Frankly if you need anything more than a loincloth and a spear, you're a giant ****ing joke.
If it is a sport than surely having pitting a boxer against a 4 year old should be a sport, as well as any other grossly unchallenging event you can think of.
 
 
For, if practiced responsibly. I live in a city, right next to the city center.
 
 
Strongly against, town. It's cruel and unnecessary.
 
 
 
Against. Without question.

- oh i don't live in the uk -

 

if you dont live in the uk then adding your opinion to this conversation, although it is admirable, is giving a false view of the british publics perceptions. if you are originally from the uk then fair enough
 
 
I'd be interested to see if the people who voted against fox hunting are against Horse Racing.... Beating an animal to death in a stressful environment in an attempt to win money.

In the Grand National alone 19 horses have died since 1990. And that is just a single race meet. It's hypocrisy in the highest form to lambast fox hutning as cruel, essentially because it is percieved to be a pastime for the upper classes who want to have a jolly in the countryside. Either be anti animal cruelty, including things like horse racing, or stfu.
 
 
i am pro fox hunting, and i live in the country.
i am also a farmer, so i see the damage foxes do first hand, no matter what everyone will no doubt start saying to me from now on  
I would like to applaud those of you who are mature enough to say you are against it, but do not see the reason why everyone else should not do it because you dont like it.
we do afterall live in a free country (cough..)
 
 
Live in THE city. I'm for it. The hypocrisy surrounding the killing of animals in this country is so perverse as to be laughable. There is a need for these animals to be killed and culled. For individuals to complain about the manner in which it is done, and then promptly stuff their face with beef and walk to Mcdonalds in leather shoes is almost sad.

I challenge you to penetrate the innards of an abbatoir and watch a tattoed youth put a bolt through the head of a cow, which, was bred, and has lived in horrendous conditions to be slaughtered in this way.

If you want to take up a real cause concerning the killing of animals there are far more difficult and challenging cases than the lazy and pretentious attack on a bunch of wealthy idiots who enjoy pomp and circumstance. Just admit this is what you are really against, not the killing itself.

When one takes this into consideration it becomes obvious that this entire campaign and subsequent back-patting is entirely inconsequential. So congratulations.
 
 
im for it but not for the sake of killing the foxes.... its a great day out and really social and it gets people out in the open instead of sitting on their backsides playing on their xbox or whatever.....

and by hating fow hunting surely then you would have a case about fishing and shooting..... and then oh look.... theres no fish on the supermarket shelves cuz its cruel to kill them and whack them round the head.....
and if you still want your chicken nuggets or whatever then you actually need the chicken to be alive at some point instead of being eaten by a fox!!

by all means hate it but dont get angry at us people who take part or actually dont mind it

Ewww. A pity I can't think of any undesirable zoonoses that can be caught from the blood of foxes. Would be amusing to see parents infect their children with BSE or AIDS. Then that would teach them not to mess around with stuff they know little about.
 
 
 
Why?

 

There's many reasons, the main one being foxes do a hell of at lot of damage and they need to be controlled.

Hunting you don't kill to eat them. Though I'm a vegan. As for a day out, the same is said about dog fighting and badger baiting. May be the fox hunters aren't talented enough to compete in equestrian sports like show jumping and polo.
 
 
people should be allowed to do what they want but i don't see the point, i live in a city
 
 
100% against the culture surrounding the 'sport' as much as the sport itself.
 
 
I think it should be allowed, foxes need to be controlled because they have no natural predators. We as humans must take this role and decimate their speicies before they take us all over!

or they have horses that cant do those types of events?? not all horses are show jumpers or are good at polo or anything.... doesnt that mean you'd put loads of them down as they are useless and getting fat just sitting in the field when you cant go out for a whole day cantering around with others..... when i went out we didnt actually catch any fox and if they are caught then they are normally ill or not well so by controlling the population you would prevent diseases spreading and mutant foxes to run around freely!

I half agree. Of course a real jockey is not supposed to be beating the horse in the slightest and it is not the purpose to kill or hurt any animals.

So to compare it to something that has the sole purpose of ripping an animal apart in a laughable parade of a horse, human and dog army is just plain stupid.

I would however gladly say they can start again, if anyone on a hunt can also be hunted themselves. That way I can (along with plenty of others i'm sure) go and even up the foxes side and rid society of some pointless people at the same time.
 
 
I f*cking hate foxes with every fiber of my being. They scream and shout all night and two vile little pests destroyed my front garden. Can you imagine what it is like to have a sleepless night but get over it have a shower coffee and good breakfast and tell yourself that you won't be cranky today and take it out on other people and then walk out the front door to find my plant pots upside down and an unsightly hole burrowed 3 feet in diameter on my lawn. And the neighbour's trash strewn across the driveway omggggggggggg

yeah anyway as much as I hate them, the way they are driven to exhaustion and then maimed to an inhumane death I am against. I suppose people who practice it should by law be entitled to practice their culture, but then again it is a fair bit barbaric so then I suppose it is right to be banned

oh yeah and I live in London
 
 
I am strongly for fox hunting due to a few reason: Foxes are pests and need to be controlled as do many other animals like deer, squirrels and rabbits. If they are not controlled then they will all run out of territory, which will causes fighting between foxes and possibly the killing of fox cubs by other dogs/reynards (male fox). Also, fox hunting was a way of controlled foxes which was started in 1632 and what other methods did they have in 1632 or controlling foxes? Since then fox hunting has grown and thousand of people across the UK from all different background take/took part in fox hunting as it was a massive part in their life and still is but they don't chase a quarry. Some of you posting on the forum thread don't realize that peoples lively hood are in fox hunting weather it is the huntsman or the whipper-in and in one day for there whole career to chance with them having no real say and for people whom have never been fox hunting or that know nothing about it to say stop you can't do it anymore it disgusting, and to have people say that fox hunting is disgusting when they don't even know what goes on! A pack of fit hounds if never a going to catch a fit fox they are to fast. They will only catch a fox that is old or injured and the fox will be killed very quickly. However, I do completely see where you are coming from saying it is cruel and I think it is good that you have an opinion and I am not saying that I am write but that is what I think but I do think it is a fantastic British tradition stopped. I also live in the country.
I would just like to add I really like foxes and think they are cute but they do need to be controlled for their own good.

Why not put them down? Because they're cute and fluffy? I imagine it doesn't really make economic sense to keep horses to kill a few diseased foxes. Unless the farmers enjoy making a loss.

well aparently its wrong to kill animals needlessly..... are you saying we should start eating horses or something to make us feel better for killing them?? why would farmers enjoy making a loss?? they would have more livestock that haven't been eaten by foxes and the horse owners would buy hay and straw..... both ways there is an income for them!! and owning a horse is more for pleasure as it's nice to go out on a hack but also nice to meet up with other people.... and you dont have to own a horse!! i borrow one from a local riding stables!!
 
 
I'm for, and I live in the country.

I'm not an active hunter myself, but I do understand the practicalities of it - I think the only thing that keeps it in practise is the lack of *feasible* alternatives (see below).

Shooting - nonselective (young and old, strong and sick), non seasonal (does not allow for breeding and can be more damaging to populations when hunted in the spring when vixens are feeding cubs), and not always 100% accurate - there is a risk of a slow painful death.

Poisoning - nonselective, hazardous to pets, livestock and other wild animals, can potentially cause problems in the ecosystem where chemicals are leached further afield, nonseasonal.

Traps / Snares - I believe these are illegal, and for good reason.

The hunt itself, notwithstanding the hunting aspect, is also a vital part of the countryside community. They provide a good deal of services to farmers and other people, such as treating or putting down sick horses (my horse was put down by the hunt after she developed severe colic; the regular vet was not available so we called the hunt vet, who came and treated her and eventually put her down free of charge) - they also remove bodies of dead animals for free, saving the farmers some quite costly charges.

With regards to the class thing, I don't really believe the ban was an act for animal welfare - if it really was, there are 101 other things that the government should have targeted as well (foreign meat and animal imports, battery farming, mass fishing, halal slaughter, breeding farms) but the significant thing was they didn't, which leads me to believe it was purely an exercise to win votes, as hunting is popularly seen as a posh sport (despite the fact that the hunts round here are anything but!) and it was an easy target. The fact you see many of the opposing side referring to hunters as "toffs" etc only serves to strengthen this argument. It's not really relevant to the ethics, but it always gets mentioned.
 
 
I am undoubtedly AGAINST fox hunting, it is quite frankly disgusting and torturous for the animal. People who believe it is 'fun' to torture and kill an innocent animal deserve to be put in prison. I accept in some countryside areas there is a need to limit the amount of foxes, but this can be done in a more humane way, than 'stalking' them with hounds and guns. Human beings who engage in such sports have no level of morality and do not see how fundamentally wrong it is to interfere in the lives of such insignificant animals.
 
 
Ambivalent and I grew up in the countryside. Most people there seem to support it.

Why can't you just, I don't know, shoot them on site? Why does it take 40 people, 15 dogs, quad bikes, 2 way radios etc to hunt a single fox? Hell, that kind of set up is enough to hunt a convict, let alone a damn fox.
Considering the increasing market for organic food, your argument about food is hollow, not to mention do you eat the fox once you have killed it? Thought not.

by all means hate it but dont get angry at us people who take part or actually dont mind it  

 

So it's a good idea for everyone to get together around the event of killing an animal. Where have we seen this before?
 
Yeah. Nothing archaic or barbaric about it at all  
You don't eat the fox, and people don't gather to enjoy the killing of the food you eat, so your argument is pointless.

Amazing that the pro-hunting people's answers only seem to be neg rep. Nice to see that it clearly appeals to an intelligent crowd  
 
 
I am pro-hunting and I live in a staunch Labour community in the north east. A pit-town actually.

I've got a lot of family who live rurally and have never-ending trouble with foxes. I don't particularly enjoy the thought of killing an animal but I appreciate that it needs to be done or the world would be over-run by foxes. For the most part, the fastest hound will "strike" and normally this is where the death occurs - the fox if struck correctly will break its neck and die instantly. It's rare that the actual mauling of the fox by the hounds is the cause of death and it is rare a death takes longer than 10 seconds. Shooting, on the other hand, can be much more slow and painful if the marksman catches the fox somewhere like a limb or the abdomen instead of the head, poisoning is incredibly slow and painful (not to mention damaging to other wildlife) etc.

I don't mind people who disagree with me, everyone is entitled to an opinion at the end of the day (just to clarify, to hopefully avoid pointless negging)
 
 
I live in the country, and am all for fox hunting, however I don't believe that being ripped apart by dogs, while still alive is very humane, so I think hunts should end by shooting the fox.
 
 
 
Such as?

 

Individuals not doing it for their own pleasure and prolonging the agony of the fox. If you need to kill something, do it quick and fast and get it over with.

in the old days it use to be a sport about the fox.... now its more just a name given to an activity that has continued and is good exercise and now they sometimes use guys running along with a scent...... EVEN MORE EXERCISE!!! the amount of times a fox actually dies is pretty small!!
 
 
Completely against, and though I live in a town, it's surrounded by countryside. No fox hunting around here though, more posh hunting

Is driving a car good exercise?  
It's a pathetic 'sport' with zero challenge and just a way for pretentious people with too much time and money to spend outside instead with their friends instead of doing something 'less suiting for people their class' such as just walking etc.

I don't think it's entirely irrelevant. I grew up next door to a hunting stables, and used to help out with the horses every day after school (this is before I was old enough to form an independent opinion about it; hunting was all around me, I didn't question it until I was about 12). The grooms I worked with were all very much fresh-faced, down to earth types who had mostly left school at 15/16 and had local accents and lived on site, but the ones who did the actual hunting, whose horses we took care of, were bankers and CEOs from London whose horses were often named after their companies, and were basically just very, very posh and wealthy. A couple of my farmer-type (not upper-class) friends used to take their horses along, but the class divide was very noticeable at the stables.

That said, it just meant that you had a mix of lower- and upper-class people who were pro-hunting in that area.

As for me, despite being involved with it for most of my childhood, as soon as I hit my teens and starting questioning things more, I realised how vile it really is and am now staunchly against. There are kinder, less dickish ways to control the fox population.

.... last i heard horse riding is a recognised sport.... how else is it in the olympic games and have lots of events around the country?? people can still walk or run round!! and like i've said before you don't have to own a horse or be upperclass or whatever!!
... 'less suiting for people their class' <-- i never said that

..... have you never ridden a horse before?? it can take a lot of energy especially on long rides!!

Not against culling when necessary, but not in this manner. So against fox hunting, and I live in the city/suburbs.
 
 
Strongly against, I live in a smallish village. It is absolutely disgusting way of killing an animal by allowing it to be torn to shreds by dogs. If a fox cull is needed, they should be trapped and killed humanely by gas or shocks. I believe also that farmers ought to protect their hens more actively rather than just shooting the foxes, how about new fencing?
the government should bring in a small allowance for certified farmers at threat from fox attacks which allows them to buck up their fences without need to resort to mindless killing of an essentially innocent animal.
 
 
 
posh hunting??

 

We hunt posh people. Though not really because this is a joke and that's illegal.

haha nice but how would you define what a posh person was????
 
 
Apparently David Cameron wants to repeal hunting.
Shame on him for wanting to push our country back into the dark ages.

Considering i'm using it in a negative tone, i'd say for this.. rich, elitist, possible fox hunter   And so on and so forth
 
 
For it and live in the city.

There seem to be alot of disqust with specifically dogs killing the foxes. I'm pretty sure its quicker and more humane for dogs, that bred through generations of killers to dispose of it as to some toff with a rifle. As to catching the fox and killing it humanely, that seems equally as difficult. How do you catch a fox without dogs?

But anyway there are greater injustices in the world.
 
 
 
in the old days it use to be a sport about the fox.... now its more just a name given to an activity that has continued and is good exercise and now they sometimes use guys running along with a scent...... EVEN MORE EXERCISE!!! the amount of times a fox actually dies is pretty small! !

 

I dont understand this argument... half of my fox hunting friends claim that hardly any foxes die, the other half say that it's an important method of hunting and we'd otherwise be overrun with hundreds of foxes.
As for the OP, I live in the country and am against it. Not the principle of culling, I know that needs to be done, but I don't see why everyone has to get all dressed up and turn it into a game. We've managed to master "community spirit" in the village where I live without getting out the horses and hunting down some wildlife as well so I don't really understand that point of view.

Luckily our *spit* Tory MP Has vowed to vote against a repeal. So she mustn't be that bad.
 
 
One of the greatest pests in the world are the species which go by the name of homosapiens. They destroy habitats, take away food, chase other species for sport, and then show off their fattened chickens to desperate foxes.

ahhh ok   just wondered  
 
 
I think that as long as the hunting doesn't get out of control, there shouldn't be a ban. In the countryside foxes are pests, just as mice and rats are in towns. We set traps and poison in towns.

I think that, as I have lived in a town my whole life, I have no right to tell people in the country how to live. Unless it is damaging the environment, that is.

More humane for a pack of Dogs to rip apart a fox than for someone with a gun to shoot it!?
What planet are you on!?
 
 
Against,  because they'll get their revenge .

  to try to prevent this from happening

Not because I particularly give a damn about foxes, they're cute and all but yeah they are a pest of chickens etc. And that's exactly my problem. Fox hunters use that as their excuse to hunt foxes.

I'm all for pest control, but if the guy who exterminates roaches turned up wearing tight white trousers, a ridiculous orange jacket and tooted on a bugle before he started gassing the place, I'd tell him to bugger off.
 
 
 
to try to prevent this from happening

 

Sorry, I haven't had enough sleep to understand your point here...
 
 
I live in the country, and I don't really know how I feel. I think viewing it as a sport is wrong, but at the same time it prevents them attacking chickens or whatever it is they do.
 
 
 
Sorry, I haven't had enough sleep to understand your point here...

 

to try to prevent mutations from happening... which would've stopped it being possible for a fox to grow as big as a child
 
 
I live in the country and over the last 5 years we have kept over 100 chickens, each time a batch of around 10-15. Each time the fox massacres them all and normally only takes one anyway. We have tried everything to keep them out but they are just consant pests and deserve to be killed, as a sport or not.
 
 
 
There should be another option

I live in the countryside, and strongly dislike foxhunting. I would never do it myself, and see it as beneath me.

But I don't have the right to enforce that view upon others. It infuriates me that the labour government, for no reason other than class hatred and spite attacked a culture that they disagree with and banned it.

So, I live in the countryside, and oppose fox hunting. But for me the right to culture, history and freedom to continue the traditions of communities, households and individuals trumps my individual distain for the sport.

The only reason fox hunting is banned and greyhound racing, or horse racing, or any other sport based around the exploitation of animals is allowed to continue was the background of those who took part in the sport/game/indifferent beating of animals for monetary gain.

And as such i oppose the hunting ban

 

Keeping a savage sport just for culture is a terrible reason not to ban it. What our your opinions on bullfighting?
 
 
 
For it, live in the countryside and have done my whole life. Apart from 8 months in a city centre (which was pretty awesome!)

 

This, pretty much. It irritates me when people who've never set foot in the country proclaim that all hunting is bad, without knowing anything about it. And I know a load of people are going to say they don't need to understand it to be against it, killing animals is always bad etc etc. but they haven't got a clue what they're talking about. It is much more than that.

Exactly. And this is what town people fail to understand. Hunting does not just involve killing animals for fun (although there are many other 'sports' that also do this - horse racing and cross-country are two examples), it is sometimes a necessity. Often hunting can be more humane than someone badly shooting a fox and it running off to die a slow painful death.
 
 
Against it completely and i live in the countryside  
 
 
 
.... last i heard horse riding is a recognised sport.... how else is it in the olympic games and have lots of events around the country?? people can still walk or run round!! and like i've said before you don't have to own a horse or be upperclass or whatever!!
... 'less suiting for people their class' <-- i never said that

..... have you never ridden a horse before?? it can take a lot of energy especially on long rides!!

 

Horse racing, yes.
Equestrianism, yes.

But riding it merely into some hills and stopping every 10 minutes to talk for 30 minutes? That is about as much a sport as walking to the toilet.
You didn't say that, but I did because have you seen the people who participate? They are almost living caricatures.

Guess what takes more energy than riding a horse? Almost every other sport other than the ones like bowling, curling etc.
 
 
 
Keeping a savage sport just for culture is a terrible reason not to ban it. What our your opinions on bullfighting?

 

I detest it. With all my heart.

But that doesnt mean i get to prevent other people from doing it due to my own moral qualms, or that a majority of do-gooders have the right to restrict the rights of the minority to an identity and culture.

You don't think the culture is worth preserving. That is your opinion. But you don't live in the community, havent experianced their way of life. You just find it distasteful, so you want to ban it and get rid of it.

That isnt democracy, that isnt multiculturalism, that isnt pluralism. That is a tyranny of the majority, and it isnt in tune with british values of individual freedom.

The social cost of percecuting minorities just because we disagree with them is higher to society than the cost of foxhunting. ergo i oppose
 
 
i'm against i'm afraid - i live in a town
 
 
 
Why can't you just, I don't know, shoot them on site? Why does it take 40 people, 15 dogs, quad bikes, 2 way radios etc to hunt a single fox? Hell, that kind of set up is enough to hunt a convict, let alone a damn fox.

 

What is your point? Who cares how it is hunted?

 
Considering the increasing market for organic food, your argument about food is hollow,
 

   

I suggest you research the like for like figures on both markets dear. *pats on head*

My point is it is hardly a sport when there is no competition involved, nor any score system. It's just an excuse to dress up, get on horses and be pompous for a day, at the expense of killing a fox. What is the difference between that and dressing up for a sacrifice? Too many similarities to class one as barbaric and another as civilised without being contradictory.
I used think "who cares?" until I saw it in action. Then it dawned on me that is was hardly a sport or even a hunt. It was just a bunch of pretentious snobs on horses having a social meeting. It was completely and utterly pathetic.
And learn to read. The word 'growing' was pretty important in that sentence   Don't be patronising when your level of comprehension is so abysmal.

A lot of people, as it goes. Thought that was obvious?

So your problem is reverse snobbery rather than the actual killing of an animal itself?

No, you said that the organic industry was growing and that it therefore nullified my point.

In short: No it doesn't whatsoever at all. Which sort of makes your barb about comprehension very very amusing.

You miss the point dramatically. The users original point was that it was barbaric. However, as I have shown, his issue is actually with the pomp and circumstance of the hunt. Evidently there is not much of an issue with barbarism, hence my issue with it pervading society but not being a problem because it is out of sight out of mind. My comment which you blindly pick up on was a way of weeding this out of him.

You should read back a few posts if you wish to barge into an ongoing exchange. I shouldn't have to word my posts specifically to the user I am adressing for the benefit of lazy members such as yourself. "   "

You don't eat the fox, therefore your point is irrelevant.

We could eat the fox, in fact you have now made me wonder what it tastes like. Probably very chewy.

Not really, a sacrifice is purely for mystical or religious reasons. A fox hunt still holds value as a way of controlling the population of a pest. Your contention deals purely in with how over the top the methods of carrying out this pest control are. Hence my accusation of reverse snobbery.

Your analogy with a sacrifice is cute but very naive.

  I am starting to think you have some difficulties with basic reading comprehension. My original point was that those who complain of the barbarity of any hunt, or animal sport. Should pay a visit to their local abatoir. It will be a real eye opener. The fact that we do not eat pests has no bearing on the fact that we kill them. The death of all of these animals holds intrinsic utility. I would say that your point was void but you never really had one.

Both have social elements and require certain attire at the expense of an animal.
The pest control argument does not work due to the complete inefficiency of it all. 40 people, quad bikes, 15 dogs etc for one fox? Hah. It is hardly pest control when there is such a large social element to it. When I saw it in action, almost all of it was just people on horses talking to each other while the dogs were on the other side of the valley.
If you were to sacrifice a pest, then suddenly your argument falls down.

You do not eat the fox, nor are cattle killed for enjoyment or a social event. Therefore you cannot compare an abattoir to a fox hunt.

If you ate the fox then to be honest I'd be far less opposed to it all as then you are giving the hunt far more of a purpose that couldn't be achieved in a regular garden.

For someone who can't comprehend that the very 'pomp and circumstance' of the hunt alludes to barbarism on the part of those who take part (this is what I took from Mazty's argument), your patronising tone seems quite misplaced.

Surely your comparison with an abattoir is equally invalid since the fox is eaten afterwards?
 
 
 
I live in the country where some of my friends frequenty hunt, I understand foxes can be pests when owning livestock but I think having hounds tear them apart as a hobby is disgusting. I have no problem with them being shot when on a farmer's land though, for example.

Why the neg rep? Am I not entitled to an opinion?

 

Quick question regarding your username: did you mean lackadaisical ? It bothers me when people use words they can't pronounce properly to sound more intelligent.

If I'm wrong and there is deliberation behind the name, ignore what I just wrote.
 
 
I'm for it (not killing for sport though) and I live in the countryside.
I only say this because foxes around where I live always kill tens of the lambs, and one killed my neighbours cat.  
 
 
 
If you're not allowed to shoot foxes then how would you kill them in a hunt?  

 

on the hunt it's not me that kills them so one with a gun licence and permit on private land except at the moment fox hunting is banned so we don't shoot any!
 
 
 
For someone who can't comprehend that the very 'pomp and circumstance' of the hunt alludes to barbarism on the part of those who take part (this is what I took from Mazty's argument), your patronising tone seems quite misplaced.

 

Could you please elaborate on your point. How exactly does the pomp and circumstance enhance the barbarism? Is this colourful spectacle any more barbaric than the industrial, filthy machinations of an abbatoir?

Would a slaughter of human beings by colourful mounted individuals and their dogs be considered more or less barbaric than human beings bred for the purpose of being slaughtered? Shunted into a mechanised death camp for a grisly, rusty and ignoble end.

Please explain to me what premise you are basing your interpretation of barbaric on?
 
 
 
Surely your comparison with an abattoir is equally invalid since the fox is eaten afterwards?

 

There is no afterwards in my argument. It alludes purely to the utility of the kill. Both kills have an inherent utility. One for pest control one for food. Remember that this concerns the apparent barbarism of the kill itself.

You realise that foxes are still killed right? It was merely a certain method that was outlawed.
 
 
Strongly against. It is unnecessary cruel speciesism. I live in the countryside.
 
 
 
Both have social elements and require certain attire at the expense of an animal.

 

Please explain how this is done at the expense of the animal. Are you seriously suggesting that the animal notices the way it's killers are dressed?  

 
The pest control argument does not work due to the complete inefficiency of it all. 40 people, quad bikes, 15 dogs etc for one fox? Hah. It is hardly pest control
 

That is exactly what it is. What does the efficieny of the thing have to do with anything? Are you against private property? Are you against indviduals spending their money in a way they see fit regardless of how efficient it is?

 
You do not eat the fox, nor are cattle killed for enjoyment or a social event. Therefore you cannot compare an abattoir to a fox hunt.
 

This might be my last reply because you're faculties do not seem to be sufficiently advanced for the kind of discussion I am after.

We are talking about the utility of the kill itself. It doesn't matter what method is being used, merely that the kill itself has inherent utility. Kills in an abbatoir are for something, hunting pests are for something. It is the METHOD of killing we are discussing. (Do you maybe understand now?)

It's done at the expense of an animal because in both instances the major event is the killing of an animal  
Efficiency has everything to do with it. If it was really pest control then surely it'd be done as quick as possible. Why the attire and vast amount of people etc? Clearly the intention is not pest control.
Since when are we just talking about the kill?   We are talking about fox hunting. Is fox hunting just about killing a fox? No. You have to consider everything to do with it. It makes no sense not to. Your concept is far to vague - it would mean you think murder is okay as you inly have to consider the method within which it was carried out in.

But you're just a troll which is clear from your language and flawed views. Enjoy.
 
 
 
Why do you support it? If we ignore the fact that an animal is being ripped to bits for amusement which seems barbaric at best, where is the challenge? ~40 people with horses, quad bikes and 2 way radios, 10-20 dogs vs one fox? Frankly if you need anything more than a loincloth and a spear, you're a giant ****ing joke.

 

F*** off back to your city where nothing of the country concerns you. Go and vote in MP's who ban fox hunting without knowing the circumstances in which it happens or why it happens, that's the only f****** joke around here. I've witnessed the effects of foxes first hand so to be honest, I'm in a better position to comment than you. And how many times do I have to say it, THE FOX IS NOT MAULED.

Even if the fox isn't mauled it's damn pathetic. It's clearly not for pest control due to the hideous inefficiency of it all. Dress up, have a social meeting etc. It's barbaric and pathetic. Just like your argument.
 
 
for, countryside. although i can see what some people are saying, that's just my opinion, since i know a lot of farmers etc.

i'm very against how some (not all, before you start!) antis protest. my friend's horse had its hamstrings slashed by people against hunting (and had to be put down). talk about hypocritical, animal cruelty-wise.

Please explain to me what premise you are basing your interpretation of barbaric on?

 

Firstly, let me say again that killing foxes (or indeed, anything) isn't where my issue lies when the animal dies for good cause. If it's deemed that the fox population needs to be controlled then I'd support a cull; if foxes are killed because a few farms have lost chickens then I'd have an issue with it. We're the more intelligent species, we/farmers should think of better ways to protect livestock. The foxes are merely doing what their instinct tells them to do.

Secondly, the method of killing foxes. IF it's judged that hunting with dogs is the best, most efficient and least traumatic way of killing a fox (I'm yet to be convinced of this, btw) then so be it. But it cannot be denied that this experience for the fox is highly traumatic and unnatural. As a predator, a fox is not designed to be chased or hunted, it is not born with the fear/instinct that 'prey' animals have. It's chased to exhaustion and then ripped to pieces - I do not for one second believe that this is something that should be enjoyed. So, if some people are willing to get dressed up and celebrate it then by my standards, there is something barbaric about these people. It leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth at the very least.

Nevertheless we don't know if other methods of culling foxes is more efficient in the countryside because they've never been implemented. In the town, it's pretty easy to lure in even the most timid fox and shoot it, I don't see why the same can't apply in the countryside.
 
 
 
Hunting you don't kill to eat them. Though I'm a vegan. As for a day out, the same is said about dog fighting and badger baiting. May be the fox hunters aren't talented enough to compete in equestrian sports like show jumping and polo.

 

a lot of equestrian sportsmen and women go fox hunting as it is a good way of keeping the horses and themselves fit.
 
 
 
Even if the fox isn't mauled it's damn pathetic. It's clearly not for pest control due to the hideous inefficiency of it all. Dress up, have a social meeting etc. It's barbaric and pathetic. Just like your argument.

 

You have clearly never been on a hunt. There are approximately 10-15 horses, 1 quad (to pull the fox pissed on blanket so would't even be there if it wasn't banned) and 10 hounds which are normally in pursuit of more than one fox. Now who's argument is pathetic?
And for people in Devon the hunt is not just about killing the fox (which it can't be about at all at the moment) it's about our heritage which is why we continue to do it even though we can't hunt the foxes.
Look, if you experienced the affect that foxes can have, then I think you would be a little more understanding or at least be open minded enough to see why people do it.
 
 
 
Since when are we just talking about the kill?   We are talking about fox hunting. Is fox hunting just about killing a fox? No. You have to consider everything to do with it.

 

you are correct in saying that people have to consider everything about it, and i am quite happy for people to come to their own conclusions and form an opinion.

however, i find it quite sad that many of the facts people use in their arguments they have probably never witnessed first hand, and are quite often biased and inaccurate
 
 
If your main reason for being against fox hunting is because they like to look nice and earn more money then you then i seriously suggest you rethink your position? Thats like being against dog fighting because the main perpetrators are usually lower class.

In fairness unless you are vegan or only meat meat and dairy from highly ethical sources i don't think you have much a leg to stand on, why is it ok to eat battery hens but not ok to chase a fox around?
 
 
And just to add that outlawing fox hunting has caused the deaths of thousands of beagles, the closing down of many businesses who offer livery etc for hunting horses and accommodation providers for the season. Is the life of one fox worth more then all that?
 
 
 
Really? You need something to be that big and red to gain attention.. It's campaigns like these that got hunting banned in the first place

 

No, it's just arguments that got hunting banned. And, to be honest, if the pro-hunting couldn't organise a decent, attention grabbing campaign to promote their lies, then that's a damn good thing.
 
 
im against fox hunting but also anti ban. If people want to chase a fox around a field then it should be their choice but why would anyone want to do it? Whats the fun in killing an animal for the sake of it. It is diffrent with shooting for there is food at the end but with a fox nothing. I live in a built up area of great yarmouth

HAHAHAHA WOW! ONE fox? How can all that be due to saving ONE fox.
You just contradicted yourself.

And I would argue yes. I would argue no business based on unnecessary cruelty has any place in modern society. As for the beagles, it's very sad, but at least they would have been put down humanely (unlike foxes), and it's not right to breed dogs for the sole purpose of cruel activities.

Ok, could really do without the patronising tone of the first part of this message. I'm not even sure what your point is but its clear to see you have fallen into the well known trap that some antis do where you think by shouting and swearing your point will be heard and listened to. It won't.

Thing is its businesses that have been handed down for generations. I mean congratulations for having a career that doesn't harm others (i seriously doubt it) but most people do what they can do to get by, especially in the country where job opportunities are few and far between.
 
 
I don't particularly like the activity, but I certainly support it being allowed.
 
 
 
No, it's just arguments that got hunting banned. And, to be honest, if the pro-hunting couldn't organise a decent, attention grabbing campaign to promote their lies, then that's a damn good thing.

 

Pretty sure the pros didn't get a chance, they weren't voting, the MPs were. Its all too easy to use propaganda and hyperbole to turn people off hunting when it involves cute mammals.

how can we use properganda when they press are shooting the foxes down so to speak the meadia have alredy tuned a lot of people against foxes look at hoxe urbon fox hunt you will see what i meen about the press wanting to do anything to do with foxes
 
 
 
well aparently its wrong to kill animals needlessly..... are you saying we should start eating horses or something to make us feel better for killing them?? why would farmers enjoy making a loss?? they would have more livestock that haven't been eaten by foxes and the horse owners would buy hay and straw..... both ways there is an income for them!! and owning a horse is more for pleasure as it's nice to go out on a hack but also nice to meet up with other people.... and you dont have to own a horse!! i borrow one from a local riding stables!!

 

What objections do you have in eating horses then?
 
 
 
More humane for a pack of Dogs to rip apart a fox than for someone with a gun to shoot it!?
What planet are you on!?

 

Personally, i'd take dogs over being shot. A dog takes one bite to the jugular and the fox is dead, and THEN it's torn apart. How long does it take for a fox to bleed to death after being shot?

Oh, and the chances of the one of the 30 or so dogs scoring a perfect bite, first time against a darting fox which is writhing to get away are one to how many?? Not to mention the stress the animal must face before hand.

A single shot through the head kills a human instantly doesn't it!? So its most likely to instantly kill a fox with minimal pain...

I cannot take you seriously, you'd rather be ripped to death by dogs over a single shot to the head?
 
 
 
You have clearly never been on a hunt. There are approximately 10-15 horses, 1 quad (to pull the fox pissed on blanket so would't even be there if it wasn't banned) and 10 hounds which are normally in pursuit of more than one fox. Now who's argument is pathetic?
And for people in Devon the hunt is not just about killing the fox (which it can't be about at all at the moment) it's about our heritage which is why we continue to do it even though we can't hunt the foxes.
Look, if you experienced the affect that foxes can have, then I think you would be a little more understanding or at least be open minded enough to see why people do it.

 

That is still an absurd amount for A FOX. Does it really take a party of over 25 to take down a single fox?  
That is pathetic. Why not just pit the US army against a primary school?
Heritage?   So does that mean everyone in Liverpool should make sailing ships and restart the slave trade? How about the Scots? Should they apply wode and go burn down Newcastle? Heritage should be remembered, but not always repeated.
What affect can a fox have? Murder? Rape? Or killing a few chickens?   Get a gun. Deal with it properly.

What is there to be open minded about? It's unchallenging on every level and has more in common with archaic, barbaric animal sacrifices than anything else.
 
 
 
If your main reason for being against fox hunting is because they like to look nice and earn more money then you then i seriously suggest you rethink your position? Thats like being against dog fighting because the main perpetrators are usually lower class.

In fairness unless you are vegan or only meat meat and dairy from highly ethical sources i don't think you have much a leg to stand on, why is it ok to eat battery hens but not ok to chase a fox around?

 

That's a really weak argument.
What about the fact that fox hunting is extremely unchallenging and archaic? Is that really suitable behaviour for 21st century society?
The foxes are not eaten, therefore you cannot compare it to animals bred to be eaten

Well, you're assuming by the same logic a country "marksman" is going to be able to score a perfect shot on the "darting fox" that kills instantly. Personally my money's on the dogs. Also that dogs are trained killers the fox is hardly offered a slow death.

Yes theres stress beforehand but ultimately its extermination/culling of a countryside pest that destroys farmers livestock. Is it acceptable a fox kill but not us it? And yes, you can argue its sport not extermination, but can't it be both?

What is so wrong with taking enjoyment in the killing of murderous vermin? We do the same to household pests/mice/rats. The only differences are the context and cosmetics.
 
 
Mildly against (town) but I'm willing to be persuaded towards the other side.
 
 
 
I don't understand?

 

i proberbly miss understud what you said but you said it was easy if it had a fluffy mammel however ite harder than you think because people leson to the meadia and and ther demonizing foxes which is turing a lot of people against them if i sound arresive i aplegise

Yes i can, why are you for the killing of thousands of male calves for your cornflakes in the moring (they arent eaten) but against killing foxes? And i was pointing out the fact you are obsessed with the social aspect of hunting, you dont have to be rich or posh to hunt but you wouldnt know that.

Well, I'm sorry, farmers are also taught to shoot and have the right to shoot to protect their livestock / crops. And it just simply is quicker and more humane than dogs. It's a fact.

No one in the modern world in towns and cities takes pride in killing vermin. None of the sane ones. I'm not sure about you but most of us use things called "Humane Traps" which capture the animal for release instead of murdering it. To be honest the farmers should do more to protect their livestock, and yes I know its hard, but it must be done. I don't think foxes are vermin, and neither do most of the people in this country. If you want to hunt foxes, move to a country less developed than ours. Here, we take pride in our wildlife.

Everything you have written here is wrong. Sorry.
 
 
I'm against it. It's stupid, cruel, and barbaric. But, I don't think it should be outlawed.
 
 
 
There is no afterwards in my argument. It alludes purely to the utility of the kill. Both kills have an inherent utility. One for pest control one for food. Remember that this concerns the apparent barbarism of the kill itself.

You realise that foxes are still killed right? It was merely a certain method that was outlawed.

 

Yeah.... I realise that they're still killed. Did I imply anywhere that I wasn't aware of that?

Your speaking as if farmers have never considered protecting their livestock better. They're not country bumpkins. I don't want to hunt foxes, it bears no interest to me, I simply condone it.

You don't consider fox's vermin because they haven't caused you any trouble. But whether you or most people consider them to be or not doesn't matter. Vermin constitute as any animal or species that are regarded a pest or nuisance. Do you really think rats are released back into the sewers?

Its not a fact shooting is more humane. Please research your opinions and give evidence before asserting this.
 
 
 
We're the more intelligent species, we/farmers should think of better ways to protect livestock. The foxes are merely doing what their instinct tells them to do.

 

How does it follow from this that we shouldn't hunt them in a certain way?

 
But it cannot be denied that this experience for the fox is highly traumatic and unnatural. As a predator, a fox is not designed to be chased or hunted, it is not born with the fear/instinct that 'prey' animals have. It's chased to exhaustion and then ripped to pieces - I do not for one second believe that this is something that should be enjoyed.
 

This is an exceptionally weak argument. "The experience of being run to exhaustion and killed by a superior predator is traumatic"....... Go figure.   and yet you could not deny that most predators do enjoy this. That can be described as natural. (Seeing as you invoke an argument from nature at the beginning) What is natural and what is not doesn't really apply here. (Unless you can conclusively prove to me why we should adhere to what is natural. (It is actually a famous fallacy))

 
So, if some people are willing to get dressed up and celebrate it then by my standards, there is something barbaric about these people. It leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth at the very least.
 

Everything you have said up to now has been subjective and shaky. The bolded is basically a summary of your entire argument, and I could forward the opposite using the same method and it would be equally as valid. Basically what you are saying is that you do not like what these people are doing and so they should stop. Declaring that it is barbaric is wholly disingenuous given the other types of slaughter that pervade our society. (As I said earlier) Take the abbatoir for instance. Anything 'natural' about that?

 
Nevertheless we don't know if other methods of culling foxes is more efficient in the countryside because they've never been implemented. In the town, it's pretty easy to lure in even the most timid fox and shoot it, I don't see why the same can't apply in the countryside.
 

I am guessing you have never spent time in the countryside? Or seen such a trap like the one you describe above. Nor have you ever fired a rifle by the looks of it, or tracked any animals in the countryside? There is certainly a relatively easy way of luring and trapping foxes, but it will inevitably involve the fox being maimed and lying in pain for an extended period of time. Or, one of the more 'humane' traps will involve the fox being trapped in a small place, gradually becoming more and more dehydrated before being ignominuously shot in the face.

This is the truth. There is nothing humane about a kill. Whether you dress up in fancy clothes and blow horns. Or wear a grimy wifebeater while ending the life of a cow with an industrial bolt gun.

You try to take the moral high ground and fail. The only individual who can completely trump my position is a vegan.
 
 
 
Its not a fact shooting is more humane. Please research your opinions and give evidence before asserting this.

 

Hypocrite much? Ill start paying more attention to your arguments when you display some proof that being torn apart by hungry dogs is more humane than a simple shot.
 
 
 
Everything you have written here is wrong. Sorry.

 

Luckily, I don't care.

It's your fault if you're stuck in the past, don't take it out on defence-less animals.

On this point, I asked my friend on the subject. Here is what he said in what I take as honest an non biased. You may think otherwise:

"Rather depends on the man shooting the gun   "

"There is so many different ways of shooting them its hard to say one is better than the other. A high powered rifle is the most humane, but many people use shotguns which can be less so. A pack is by far the most productive."

"Indeed. However. If your livelihood depends on stock and old Charlie Fox up their comes and kills/maims 75% of them, humanity takes second seat to efficiency - right or wrong. This is where we are lacking following the Hunting ban. A hunt is a far more efficient method of killing foxes in MOST cases."

The other trouble with guns over dogs are the logistics. Its not like the fox readily comes over to say hello. Using dogs makes a day of it, it exercises the dogs and horses and the dogs go to the fox. I postulate thats how it became a sport in the first place, particularly when guns weren't as effective.
 
 
 
No i don't understand your typing.

 

i get it alot   your not the only one

Ahhh ok, I see your friend is what you call a knowledgeable such a reliable source.....

I don't really see why I am arguing with you, Let's face it, the ban won't be repealed and therefore Inhumane Hunting with dogs will remain a crime, as it should be.

Let me just quote an evidently more reliable and knowledgeable source
"Hunting enthusiasts claim that the first hound to reach the fox gives it a 'nip to the back of the neck' to kill it instantly. However, dogs which hunt in packs tend to bring down their prey by a series of bites and tears to the quarry's sides and hind quarters. This claim of a humane, quick death also ignores the suffering brought about by the deliberately prolonged chase.

When the fox is dead, most hunts cut off the tail ('brush'), the feet ('pads') and the head ('mask') as trophies. The carcass is then thrown to the hounds. Some hunts also indulge in the practice of 'blooding' - the smearing of fresh fox blood on the faces of those, usually children, who have witnessed their first kill. "

I won't be replying now as I should be revised.

Likewise with revision,

I felt my source gave a fairly unbiased account. But I agree, we're not going to persuade each other.

Also what people tend to do with the carcass doesn't really matter, a dead animal is a dead one. Blooding is irrevelevant, I don't agree with it and tends not to be practiced by most hunting groups.
 
 
 
I think you're getting yourself very worked up. Have you been on a hunt?

 

I honestly would not want to go on a hunt. Ethics comes higher than any pleasure gained. I have been horse riding. What's wrong with a simple group horse ride through the forest?

You don't need to own a horse, you can loan one for the day if you like. Calves killed due to the milk trade are not used in human consumption and are often bought by hunts to feed their dogs. Look it up.

Personally i think football is pathetic and barbaric and serves no purpose but there we are. I honestly think you need to stop getting so worked up about it and perhaps think about what you can do to stop inflicting suffering on the animals you do everyday

The milk is ergo your argument is ****ty at best.
Football inherently hurts no one and is a test of skill.
How is hunting a fox in any way, shape or form challenging? It isn't challenging, shows no skill, and has no competition involved. It isn't a sport - it's a barbaric, archaic joke that still plagues this country.
This isn't just about the suffering of animals; it's about the utter absurdity of fox hunting.

Well it isnt as male calves are killed and dumped or sold abroad in the European veal trade which is incredibly cruel for your tea in the morning, but thats ok. Football encourages awful behaviour from people that has resulted in deaths etc, but thats ok. Hunting requires great skill in horsemanship, dogmanship, tracking etc etc etc.

No, animals who are bred in factory farms have no life and then cruely killed. At least the foxes, prior to the hunt, have experienced a fufilling and natural life.

 
Killing the calves for nutrion. Why are you killing the fox? ****s and giggles?

 

To control the fox population.

Most people can survive quite well on a meat free diet. Not all but most. So the "killing for nutrition" argument does not work.

 
Seriously? In order for anyone to form an opinion about anything they must first experience it?

 

Well, I believe that we should be in an informed position and ideally should either partcipate in, or witness, a hunt. I wonder how many of those who object to huntng have ever set foot in the countryside.

I have never participated in a hunt, nor do I want to. But at the age of 10 I did witness one. I was with school friends in woods near Hexham (Northumberland) setting up a camp when a hunt came past us. First the fox, with a look of terror in its eyes, then the pack of hounds. Followed by about ten hunters.

I live on the edge of town and country, on the border with Northumberland but still only seven miles from Newcastle, although I've always spent more time in the country (at least until my teens) and identify with rural life over urban life.

I recognise the need to control foxes, but I vehemently reject any economic justification for fox hunting (particularly those made on conesequentianlist grounds) and reject it as being thought of as a sport. I also object to any appeal to traditional and rural culture.

I just think you are talking a load of made up bull without knowing any facts. Why on earth are you bring up things ive said in other threads and how would you even know if i have received benefits?

I don't really need anything to get into my skull especially not because some angry boy on the internet says so. I am happy in what i believe (have i actually said im pro hunting anywhere?) and i am happy that i know the facts before i start losing my temper and become unpleasant and ridiculous like you are now.
 
 
 
The dogs are often trained so that they don't maul it to pieces and then leave it alone because people did recognise that it was inhumane for the dogs to kill it.

 

Ha, ha, ha. This is very naive. You know one of the pieces of evidence put forward in the research before the ban was the fact that foxes are consistently mauled by the first thing the hounds can grab, ie hindquarters, tail, legs. The death can be very prolonged. They are not in any sense of the word "trained" to deliver lethal bites to the neck, heart, or any other ridiculous tales I've heard literally so many of from pro-hunt people.
 
 
 
Well if you haven't been you should probably stop spouting rubbish then.

No. *sigh*

I was just proving the point that you don't need to experience something first hand to form an opinion. Simple enough?

Ahh now you're assuming that i'm angry   I just think YOU are talking a load of made up bull without knowing any facts. Tehehe

And I don't care If I appear unpleasant. I see many more unpleasant qualities in your quietness to be quite honest.

Actually I use milk as part of a controlled diet to aid in bodybuilding.
How does fox hunting help anyone? It doesn't.
Can you please explain how the sport of football encourages any sort of behaviour. A bunch of guys on a pitch kicking a ball around in a non-contact sport encourages violence? Really? Please, do go on...  
The sheer numbers involved makes the hunt a ****ing joke. 1 fox vs a guy with a spear and loincloth, sure. 1 fox vs quadbikes, a horde of dogs and 20 odd people on horseback? You are joking, right?

I've never listened to the propaganda. I only really took this view when I saw it first hand.  
Killing and eating animals for nutrition is natural and acceptable. Killing for fun is archaic and barbaric. But then again any view I shared with you I'd want to drastically re-evaluate.
 
 
 
Neither are you.

I'm just happy that this repealing almost definitely won't happen.

Yeah I have some revision to do but I've done enough today.

 

Ok, obviously you aren't grasping the point here at all.
 
 
 
F*** off back to your city where nothing of the country concerns you. Go and vote in MP's who ban fox hunting without knowing the circumstances in which it happens or why it happens,

 

Why it happens? It happens because farmers don't like anything that disrupts business. Animals are money and foxes are a disruption to that cash flow. The problem we have here is that the typical farmer's response to anything living that messes with their livestock is KILL KILL KILL. That's why many livestock parasites in the world (and increasingly in the UK) are now being found in certain areas to have resistance to anthelmentics we've long-depended on and overused without education and careful manipulation of their use. That's also why farmers want to kill every fox in the ecosystem, because it disrupts business. A viewpoint I err on the side of supporting with the hunting debate, is this; farming by definition tries to take something which is living, part of the wild, with wild ancestral roots, and domesticate it into an ideal setting for production. If farmers want to try and "pen in" a little slice of nature, in the form of land, animals and crops, then they will have to accept that nature has its ups and downs, in this case, foxes. Of course, they can do whatever is within reason to manipulate those problems and try not to let them hinder production. But there always has to be a line where those measures don't infringe on other important parameters, like the foxes' welfare. The fox is just doing what it would do to any other group of vulnerable wild animals in a predator-prey relationship, and farmer doesn't like it. If you want to pen in your own little slice of nature then you have to accept that you can't standardise it and make it plastic like a factory, it's still nature. And to make the other side of the same coin fair, the consumers should be willing to accept a rise in prices on their end associated with the greater risk of keeping livestock without being able to hunt them with hounds. Farming just got riskier and if prices reflect that then so be it.

However, all this debate is largely moot anyway because hunting still goes on just as it always did.
 
 
 
Now you're just being silly aren't you.

 

Valid comparison. Experience is valuable in any debate but part of our mental capacity as humans is that if we have enough information, evidence and exposure to material on a topic, we can usually be entitled to some degree of an informed opinion on it after giving it thought. Not being silly at all.
 
 
 
Actually I use milk as part of a controlled diet to aid in bodybuilding.
How does fox hunting help anyone? It doesn't.
Can you please explain how the sport of football encourages any sort of behaviour. A bunch of guys on a pitch kicking a ball around in a non-contact sport encourages violence? Really? Please, do go on...  
The sheer numbers involved makes the hunt a ****ing joke. 1 fox vs a guy with a spear and loincloth, sure. 1 fox vs quadbikes, a horde of dogs and 20 odd people on horseback? You are joking, right?

I've never listened to the propaganda. I only really took this view when I saw it first hand.  
Killing and eating animals for nutrition is natural and acceptable. Killing for fun is archaic and barbaric. But then again any view I shared with you I'd want to drastically re-evaluate.

 

Ok 1) Please stop swearing at me, it doesn't make your point any more valid.
2) Erm football riots? Duh.
3) I wasn't aware numbers were the ultimate cornerstone of what makes something a sport but ok.
4) You are still avoiding my male calf analogy but ok, great, you drink it to bulk up for whatever reason. You are still part of the cause of calves being taken from their mothers, killed and left to rot? Why is that different?
5) Like the swearing, insulting me isn't really helping.
 
 
 
Ok, obviously you aren't grasping the point here at all.

 

Lol. Traaa wierdo!

Well, it is. If you haven't seen a hunt or at least haven't done any research into what common practice is then youre just jumping on the hyperbole bandwagon. Pretty obvious that foxhunting and raping children aren't even on the same level here. Bit silly.
 
 
 
Lol. Traaa wierdo!

 

Wow. Really showing your age here kid. I hope you aren't taking critical thinking for Alevel.
 
 
 
No, animals who are bred in factory farms have no life and then cruely killed. At least the foxes, prior to the hunt, have experienced a fufilling and natural life.

To control the fox population.

Most people can survive quite well on a meat free diet. Not all but most. So the "killing for nutrition" argument does not work.

Well, I believe that we should be in an informed position and ideally should either partcipate in, or witness, a hunt. I wonder how many of those who object to huntng have ever set foot in the countryside.

I have never participated in a hunt, nor do I want to. But at the age of 10 I did witness one. I was with school friends in woods near Hexham (Northumberland) setting up a camp when a hunt came past us. First the fox, with a look of terror in its eyes, then the pack of hounds. Followed by about ten hunters.

I live on the edge of town and country, on the border with Northumberland but still only seven miles from Newcastle, although I've always spent more time in the country (at least until my teens) and identify with rural life over urban life.

I recognise the need to control foxes, but I vehemently reject any economic justification for fox hunting (particularly those made on conesequentianlist grounds) and reject it as being thought of as a sport. I also object to any appeal to traditional and rural culture.

 

You know what I enjoy? Cheap food. This would not be possible without the techniques of farming. Personally I think it's better to be able to feed the masses than to let them perish because a pretty brain dead cow doesn't have an entire field to mindlessly wander.

Does it really require a social gathering to kill a single fox? Due to the dire inefficiency of it, that sounds like an excuse rather than a reason, otherwise if it was to control the population, wouldn't better methods be used?

Survive yes. But again this comes back to the factor of the cost of food. Not to mention if you anything like bodybuilding, a meat free diet is absurd.

I 100% agree with the notion that calling it a sport is absurd as it has no elements of a sport - no challenge, no competition, no scoring system etc. It's just an archaic tradition that should have ideally died away with time.
 
 
 
Wow. Really showing your age here kid. I hope you aren't taking critical thinking for Alevel.

 

It's the internet, chill out haha. I hope you aren't always this uptight.  
 
 
 
Killing the calves for nutrion. Why are you killing the fox? ****s and giggles?

 

No, she is right on this point. The dairy industry does have alot to answer for in some respects. Not sure if you understand the point she is making but male dairy calves are a by-product of the dairy industry because they (obvious, being male) don't produce milk. So unless they're of prize stock to be kept for their semen, they are culled by the bucket-load. Just as in the egg industry, male chicks born of the layer-hen gene line are useless because they (being male) can't lay eggs, and have poor genes for producing meat, so are literally dropped into a blender or gassed.
 
 
 
a lot of equestrian sportsmen and women go fox hunting as it is a good way of keeping the horses and themselves fit.

 

There are plenty of sports that people can undertake to get themselves fit. I used to be an archer in my day as well as a white water kayaker. There are a huge number of sports out there that are not considered mainstream and should be taken advantage of. If the mainstream sports like football, rugby, squash, rowing and cricket are not appealing, there are other sports that have varying degrees of gaining fitness, or just for social enjoyment. As for the horses, they could probably become more fitter with regular sessions of polo than seasonal hunts.
 
 
 
Well, it is. If you haven't seen a hunt or at least haven't done any research into what common practice is then youre just jumping on the hyperbole bandwagon. Pretty obvious that foxhunting and raping children aren't even on the same level here. Bit silly.

 

Obviously they aren't on the same level, one is much worse than the other. But it's just an analagy to make the point. And you're the one making poor assumptions here. You are right about me having never attended a hunt (but I will one day), but how do you know I haven't done research into the matter? How do you know I haven't spent weeks and weeks of my free time day in day out researching this topic to the point where I'm so damn bored with it I no longer care for the outcome? You don't. You're just assuming I haven't researched it and am jumping on a bandwagon because my opinion is not in line with yours. You obviously think that if I had researched it my opinion simply must be the same as yours. And that, is a really poor show on your part.
 
 
Hm, I grew up in the countryside and now live in a town.... I'll put countryside 'cause that's where I lived when the ban happened.
 
 
 
It's the internet, chill out haha. I hope you aren't always this uptight.  

 

The last call of an internet hero   an hour ago you were literally foaming at the mouth desperately smashing the keyboard with your ill-informed fingers.

Wouldn't suggest polo personally, totally agree that "it keeps horses fit" is a crappy argument.

Please google football riots and educate yourself.

I don't care if you swore once, you've been swearing throughout this debate and it makes you look thick.

If you can get a proper definition of the word sport il be more inclined to agree with you.

The the calves are not used for food, killing the fox saves the chickens that you eat and use for eggs. Again why is it different?

What is my type exactly? Are you this vile to everyone who doesn't share your view on things or am i special?
 
 
 
Ha, ha, ha. This is very naive. You know one of the pieces of evidence put forward in the research before the ban was the fact that foxes are consistently mauled by the first thing the hounds can grab, ie hindquarters, tail, legs. The death can be very prolonged. They are not in any sense of the word "trained" to deliver lethal bites to the neck, heart, or any other ridiculous tales I've heard literally so many of from pro-hunt people.

 

I'm sorry, I'm a person who goes on hunts regularly so I am in a better position to know surely?

This does happen in some cases, and it did used to occur more than it does now but I can say I have never been a part of a hunt where a dog has mauled a fox. It is a very rare occurrence.

Can't stand city foxes either but i understand why they are here (interestingly enough i don't live on Gloucester Road any more but never mind).
 
 
Majority opinion is irrelevant on this issue, the majority have never even seen a fox let along what the little bastards do, the majority do not have to earn a living from the land, the majority would see a return to the death penalty but the bleeding heart activists wouldn’t agree with that would they.

I could give you the ins and outs of foxhunting but the bleeding heart townies would still not listen, I simply take solace in the fact the ban is completely ignored and most anti-hunt activists are told to get lost by the police when they turn up with 'evidence'.

Over the years New Labour treated the countryside as simply something pretty to look at. Fact is the countryside has the sole purpose of food production and it has been managed in such a way for hundreds of years. It is not the place of meddling politicians to come out and try and change the ways, if there was a better way of controlling fox population do you not think we (farmers) would have done it by now! You wouldn’t tell a surgeon how to do a heart transplant, a solder how to defuse a bomb or an electrician how to wire a house. Managing the countryside is just as complex yet people feel they have the right and the knowledge to stick there noses in. Everything in the countryside happens for a reason, including fox hunting.

As for the class thing (something Labour MP’s have claimed motivated them), absolute ********. Yes the local duke will come out and hunt but so will all his staff, from farm hand to tenant farmer to land agent. There is more to a hunt than chasing foxes, many people follow on foot and bike and will help out when they can. There are only a coupe of thou ennobled people in the country, simply numbers will tell you the majority are not landed gentry.

Animal cruelty, what cruelty? Hunting is the most humane and safest way to kill a fox, only a mad man would think bullets whizzing and poison lying about the countryside is a good thing.

With regards to the poll. I live in the true countryside of North Northumberland. Over the years however more and more new build houses have been bought by people from the town who commute into the city for work. While I don’t disapprove of this, just because someone says they live in the countryside it doesn’t mean there a countryman.
 
 
 
Ah I see what you mean. Surely the meat is used for some purpose? Seems completely pointless &amp; an economic waste to let meat go to waste  

 

Dairy bull calves have such poor genes for meat comformation (as dairy animals need good genes for milk, not meat) that it is literally unfeasible to feed up a dairy bull calf and try to sell it for meat. They have the worst feed-conversion ratios and are the equivalent of an ecto-bag-of-bones in the animal world. They just don't put alot of meat on, and that which they do put on is poor quality. Having said, some people do buy dairy bull calves (often crosses though), and put them through intensive systems where they have them in and out of the farm within a short space of time, to get the most of them while they're at an age where they'll put on at least something. But on the whole pure bred dairy bull calves go to waste, people even try to give them away at cattle markets sometimes. Sadly the plastic tag in their ear can often be worth more than the animal itself, which says alot for the value of life in modern agriculture but is simply a fact of life.

Edit: or as said by grumps below me, they go to veal or the hunt for feeding hounds.

Yes if you actually read what i said rather then ignored it you would have found they go to Europe for veal (very cruel) or they go to the hounds you hate to be fed. I would have included a link to something that explains this but i refuse to post vegan propaganda and anything else is hard to find.
 
 
 
Can't stand city foxes either but i understand why they are here (interestingly enough i don't live on Gloucester Road any more but never mind).

 

Oh that's a shame. I live on Gloucester road and I love the foxes I see trotting about here.

Il be honest i'm on the fence on the subject as a rule and i think foxes are gorgeous to look at. If backed into a corner i think enough are killed on the roads and defences on commercial chicken coops are able to withstand most attacks. I tend to fall on the pro side mostly due to utter drivel that spouts from people who claim to know all about it but really can't get past the anthropomorphic ideals they have in their heads

Well, I can only agree with most of what you say. I don't anthropomorphise but simply try to look at everything from a welfare point of view and work from there, within the widest constraints possible. Be a pretty shoddy vet otherwise. I also (honestly) try not to disregard economics either because at the end of the day the country needs farming and farmers need business.

Fox hunting certainly fits the definition of sport given there. There is physical exertion, as you are riding a horse. There is skill, horse riding and arguably tracking. There is a set of customs to be followed. It can be argued that it is not competitive, but on the other hand, if the fox is not caught, surely it has won?

Not a vet yet. I have lived near that butchers, but never been. As an interesting aside, I saw a fox outside there yesterday, licking something off the pavement. Got so close I could have stroked it, u jelly? I don't really care much for organic, I find most organic stuff abit of a joke, anyone who has kept plants in their garden and sprayed abit of Weed and Feed/whatever on them and then marvelled at the benefits (ie most people) is pretty much unable to criticise non-organic farming cos it's simply the same thing. I also humanely dispatch of slugs found in the kitchen of my scratty student house, and alway marvel at the mites crawling over them, which look pretty cool. I don't really have anything else I can counter with in this little e-penis measuring competition but I did rescue a butterfly once and I never harm bees (some people try to kill them, it makes me mad) so HOW DO YOU LIKE THEM APPLES.

Never tried game, but seen it at the butcher's before. Venison's dear isn't it?

edit: Not sure if my shameless one-liner is going translate well over this medium

Pretty terrible that. It shouldn't really be a sport if your opponent is fighting for his/her life. Hunting animals with the intent of eating them is okay because it's necessary and part of the food chain. Hunting animals for fun is just downright cruel and if a person needs to shoot a fox to have a good day then that person should be put in a 'white house'.

Against. Strongly against.

I'm just one of those people who think every living being on this earth only has one life, and that's not something I'm prepared to take away from it, regardless of it's size or what species it belongs to.

Although I do love riding and bringing my dogs with me. I just don't want to hunt anything on those rides.

Against when used for sport.

I live in Cambridge, so a city - but never far from the countryside.
 
 
 
Doesn't sound any different to MMA or boxing to me.

 

So are you telling me that fox hunting has a levelled playing field? Also, do foxes chose to participate in being hunted? LOL. What do foxes gain by wining? Bear in mind that they were already alive before the hunt, so being able to live isn't a prize.
 
 
 
Fox hunting certainly fits the definition of sport given there. There is physical exertion, as you are riding a horse. There is skill, horse riding and arguably tracking. There is a set of customs to be followed. It can be argued that it is not competitive, but on the other hand, if the fox is not caught, surely it has won?

 

If you think riding a horse is exerting enough to be a sport, is shopping then also a sport?
If fox hunting is a sport, then so is shopping.
 
 
 
You know i have some perfect responses to these most excellent points but i have asked you twice to stop speaking to me like that and you aren't able to. We can continue you this when you have learnt how to speak to people politely.

 

In other words you are bailing because it is getting too tough. What a surprise....

Damn good points you've brought up there. Good going.

Like Supermarket Sweep you mean?
 
 
 
Like Supermarket Sweep you mean?

 

That'd certainly be a sport if fox hunting is  

I mean shopping has general rules you have to adhere to and tradition to follow with vague challenge.
Rules = You can't shop lift
Tradition = Walk, don't run, dress in appropriate clothing etc.
Challenge = Get the lowest price
 
 
It's not something I'd do personally, but I feel a little uneasy taking the choice away from others.
 
 
 
You know what I enjoy? Cheap food. This would not be possible without the techniques of farming. Personally I think it's better to be able to feed the masses than to let them perish because a pretty brain dead cow doesn't have an entire field to mindlessly wander.

 

Wow, talk about speciesism  

You do realise that modern factory farming is arguably partly to blame for the "starving masses" that we current have (inefficient use of grain used to feed animals which could otherwise be used to feed human beings as well)? Not to mention the environmental effects of meat eating, and the effects on human health?

 
Does it really require a social gathering to kill a single fox? Due to the dire inefficiency of it, that sounds like an excuse rather than a reason, otherwise if it was to control the population, wouldn't better methods be used?
 

Which is why I don't agree with it being used simply out of tradition. To continue doing something, whether that's because it is natural (eating meat - even that's debateable) or traditional (fox hunting) is absurd. Although I have encountered many people who do hunt, and support it as their tradition and sport, I have never encountered anyone who does it solely for these reasons. The reason is to control the population.

I can reject it as a tradition or sport, and express my personal dislike of it, but not reject its ultimate purpose - to control the fox population.

As for alternatives this is the problem. I will direct you to Renner's post: -

 
if there was a better way of controlling fox population do you not think we (farmers) would have done it by now! You wouldn’t tell a surgeon how to do a heart transplant, a solder how to defuse a bomb or an electrician how to wire a house. Managing the countryside is just as complex yet people feel they have the right and the knowledge to stick there noses in. Everything in the countryside happens for a reason, including fox hunting.

Animal cruelty, what cruelty? Hunting is the most humane and safest way to kill a fox, only a mad man would think bullets whizzing and poison lying about the countryside is a good thing.

With regards to the poll. I live in the true countryside of North Northumberland. Over the years however more and more new build houses have been bought by people from the town who commute into the city for work. While I don’t disapprove of this, just because someone says they live in the countryside it doesn’t mean there a countryman.

 

I would also like to draw attention that that final paragraph which I think is an interesting point. There is a clear difference between a person living in the country (one who has recently moved there and has spent all his/her life in urban surroundings) and a country person (someone with experience and knowledge of rural affairs).

 
Survive yes. But again this comes back to the factor of the cost of food. Not to mention if you anything like bodybuilding, a meat free diet is absurd.

 

It's not absurd. It requires far more care but it is possible.

Besides, I did say most can survive on a meat free diet. Not all. I was thinking more those who are allergic to typical non-meat sources of protein (soya, nuts) or those in the developing world, who may not have access to foodstuffs necessary for a vegetarian diet, who will otherwise suffer were they denied a daily meat intake for a meat diet has been shown to be of significant nutritional value to those in the developing world.

But I don't put cost before ethics and suffering nor do I think a vegetarian or vegan diet, if properly planned, is more expensive.

I do find it extraordinarily hypocritical that you're up in arms over the killing of foxes, but seem to be willing to support the annual holocaust of billions of animals every year.

 
2) Erm football riots? Duh.

 

You're pointing to extreme, relatively isolated incidents. Football/competitive sport does not cause riots. If you're referring to football hooligans these people are so thick, violent and partisan that they'd use anything to justify their behaviour.

When you first brought up football causing death and injury I thought you meant between players.

Spoiler:
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v= http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzEGkmY-Vio 

The difference here is that, whilst "tackles" (not really a tackle, as the intention was to injure the player and not get the ball) such as these are in no way justifiable, it is in theory a level playing field with consenting players.

 
, I saw a fox outside there yesterday, licking something off the pavement. Got so close I could have stroked it

 

It would bite your hand off  
 
 
 
I don't think it's entirely irrelevant. I grew up next door to a hunting stables, and used to help out with the horses every day after school (this is before I was old enough to form an independent opinion about it; hunting was all around me, I didn't question it until I was about 12). The grooms I worked with were all very much fresh-faced, down to earth types who had mostly left school at 15/16 and had local accents and lived on site, but the ones who did the actual hunting, whose horses we took care of, were bankers and CEOs from London whose horses were often named after their companies, and were basically just very, very posh and wealthy. A couple of my farmer-type (not upper-class) friends used to take their horses along, but the class divide was very noticeable at the stables.

That said, it just meant that you had a mix of lower- and upper-class people who were pro-hunting in that area.

As for me, despite being involved with it for most of my childhood, as soon as I hit my teens and starting questioning things more, I realised how vile it really is and am now staunchly against. There are kinder, less dickish ways to control the fox population.

 

Fair comment - you get a certain amount of class divide in most activities and I suppose it does cost a bit to keep a hunter. But I do know a number of farming folk who also join the hunt and I think it's too easy to dismiss the anti-hunt argument as being simply class hate or envy. I do believe that the majority of the politicians who were behind the bill were driven by moral considerations rather than inverted snobbery.

A while ago my band played for the Bromyard Hunt Ball - what an obnoxious, arrogant bunch - treated us like servants. We refered to them as "The Badger Baiters" and the guy in the red coat was obviously the Master Baiter. Never again.
 
 
 
In other words you are bailing because it is getting too tough. What a surprise....  

 

Lol no not at at all, i just refuse to be spoken to in the manner that you are. Also try horse riding and tell me it isnt physical excercise. Oh no wait, you're talking rubbish about something you know nothing about...again.

Also my mind boggles at how you can be for cheap nmeat for your mindless bodybuilding obsession but you are aganst chasing vermin around the countryside? You are either incredibly stupid or trolling.
 
 
 
It would bite your hand off  

 

Of course it would, it was blind too, or at least heavily visually impaired so even more the likely to snap. But I could have stroked it, if I'd wanted

Of course you think horse riding is exercise  
It's not exactly a 1:30 hour gym workout. If you think it is....someone is grossly out of shape.
The idea of fox hunting is ludicrous and barbaric. "Hey lets kill something for fun!". Yeah, because that's a 21st century attitude and not something more suiting of the Dark Ages.
And no dear. Just because you don't understand me doesn't mean I'm either stupid or a troll

"Hey lets keep animals in disgusting conditions and kill them en mass because im an alpha male who likes bodybuilding" I like that you think 21st C farming methods are more palletable then old fashioned blood sports. In reality they are both as bad as each other but you don't care because one suits your lifestyle.

I'm not going to continue telling you horseriding is legitimate excercise becausee it seems unless you are being agreed with you don't listen, this has been proven time and tiome again throught this thread. Stop being so childish and open your mind.

Nice strawman.
You mean "Hey let's keep animals in poor conditions so we can feed the majority of people".
Would you prefer famine?  

It is hardly a sport. It's just mindless killing. And yes, feeding the population takes a great role over killing animals for fun in most peoples eyes.  

Horse riding is hardly exercise, especially when fox hunting where you have large periods of sitting about doing jack ****.
Childish and open minded? Rich coming from you who is making such absurd arguments. "Football causes riots!!!!11!! OLOLOL!!11!"

Please grow up, you are embaressing yourself.

You don't get rugby riots or tennis riots or cricket riots, think about that for a second.

Modern farming methods are the cause of a lot of poverty and famine in teh world as mentioned in this thread. You, again, no nothing if horse riding so id probably just stop mentioning it if i were you.

Its not a debate if you just keep screaming and stamping your feet espcially if you are throwing some rather childish insults in the mix. Youre letting yourself and your silly argument down.

The education system has clearly failed you as you are unable to deduce that the sport of football doesn't encourage any behaviour whatsoever - it is merely a comment on the mind-set of the supporters than the sport itself  
Oh yeah modern farming methods cause famine hence why famine is significantly less than it was 30 years ago. Your logic is totally water tight there dear.
Horse riding when used for fox hunting is hardly skilful or tiring unless you think sitting on a horse for 20 minutes counts as exercise.  

The only one being childish here is you are you fail to grasp basic logic whilst using in reply the flawless argument of "Yeah well but like you is total wrong!". At 24, stunning show of intellect and maturity, wrapped into a golden ball of wisdom. Go you?

You know what i'm not wasting my time with you anymore, no this isn't me giving in and accepting your view. You are completely unable to actually debate or even consider another viewpoint and i feel i am just going around in circles whilst you try and belittle me and repeat the same nonsense over and over again. Its boring and not getting anyone anywhere. Believe what you like about horserding/fox hunting/eating intensivly farmed milk i don't care.

Honestly you are so laughably hypocritical that the fact your take yourself so seriously is dissturbing and probably the indication of a personality disorder.

I am happy to debate and discuss with anyone else in this thread.

Good day.
 
 
 
Against. Strongly against.

I'm just one of those people who think every living being on this earth only has one life, and that's not something I'm prepared to take away from it, regardless of it's size or what species it belongs to.

Although I do love riding and bringing my dogs with me. I just don't want to hunt anything on those rides.

 

What about cats? They have 9 lives :P

In short your argument has been shown beyond doubt to be the laughable mess that it is but god forbid you admit that. Instead you'd rather post a pretentious conceited reply in a last ditch effort to try and remain correct.
Nice going dear. Not sure where you fell down harder - claiming modern farming techniques cause famine or football causes riots.

Have you ever ridden a horse? It is actually quite tiring, especially if trotting, or doing jumps which happens a lot during a hunt.

When I saw a hunt more time was spent sitting on the horse and just talking then any riding whatsoever, hence why I would say in a fox hunt horse riding hardly counts as exercise due to the long periods of doing nothing.

a lot of hunts have nail foxes to things so when the time comes they can be releated in front of a pack of hounds
 
 
Killing foxes that kill the owners sheep is right. To those of you who say it's inhumane because its not natural. What makes us un-natural?

The method of killing could be more humane, but nobody complains about fishing!

I have witnessed a hunt on a relatives farm, so yes I have seen it first hand.

Another point is, is letting foxes kill sheep humane? Just because its natural doesn't mean its humane, they often kill for fun even if they have already killed a sheep - just to get "fresh" meat. They kill in nearly the same as dogs kill foxes. Remember foxes have a high k/d ratio so killing a fox, may be the greatest happiness to the greatest number!

As in nailed to a tree? Hate to say this, but you can't really chase something which is nailed to a tree, so that isnt really a hunt is it?

Not always a fox, can be anything thats been killed recently really, rabbits, deer etc. Problem with drag hunting is that it tears up the land as the hunt go hammer and tongs for the whole day because a dead animals is easier to track then a live one.
 
 
 
What about cats? They have 9 lives :P

Why is it chained to a park bench? Last time I checked fox hunts dont go through parks. I think what you have there is someone showing extreme animal cruelty, and that should not be permitted at all.

use your amganiton open your eyes
 
 
You guys seem to know quite a bit about this, so I thought I'd ask since I'm a little confused.

Someone said that foxes kill farmers sheep, but as far as I'm aware Red Foxes are like what? 8kg? and sheep as be like 50kg to 80kg. I could understand if it was lambs, but from my experience foxes usually go hunting between midnight and dawn. So if the farmer simply put the sheep inside during these hours there shouldn't really be a problem.

The problem with that is space and time. To have a significant number of sheep, you need a lot of land, which means it is all quite spread out. It simply isnt feasible to bring the sheep and lambs in every night. Also, sheep are incredibly stupid creatures, whereas foxes are clever and have very sharp teeth, so a fox sneaking up on a sheep and biting its throat would not surprise me at all.

*Imagination

Also, I have never heard of this practice, and even were it true there would be no reason to chain a fox to a park bench in such a cruel way. Hunts take place in open country and in woodland, not in parks.

That may be true, but the size just doesn't make it logical to me, also I'm not trying to attack anyone on here, but from what I gathered they generaly don't hunt larger animals.

The fox may well be acting in self defence. If it has tracked a mouse into a field containing sheep with lambs, the sheep will attack the fox to defend the lambs.
 
 
From a town, against fox hunting.

I dont agree with any form of hunting for fun. Hunting for food is fine, by all means kill any animal you like as long as 1) your going to eat it and 2) its not going to suffer.

Also, about the problems foxes cause in the countryside; Yeah I accept that, and have lost some animals to hungry foxes myself. There are humane ways to deal with it though, i wouldnt round up the cavalry and chase it down with a pack of hounds.

like the hunt are going to say the nail foxes to a bench are they they want the public tov support then not condem them
meen wile you know the hunts say they care for the animals hmmmmmmm i....... i.i cant put my finger on what is rong with this pic hmmmm some one help me please

Ok, call me silly and old fashioned, but if it's self defence, why is it seen as grounds for the farmers to hunt it?

And with it's size, to me it seems like a lion taking down an elephant. I could of course be completely missing something here, but it just doesn't seem reasonable. Animals who hunt for their prey just rarely attack animals that much larger than themselfs from what I've gathered, of course feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.

Please learn to speak proper english, I can barely understand you. That picture is a pro hunting picture because many horses are kept primarily for the purpose of hunting, and without hunting they would not be kept, and would so be killed. This is even more true of the hounds, as they cannot be trained as domestic pets once trained as a killing machine.

You are right it is rare for adult sheep to be attacked, but lambs certainly are as they are weak and relatively defenceless. Also, the fox has revealed itself to be in the area, and if the farmer also has chickens, or a nearby farmer has chickens, they do not want the fox to break into the chicken sheds, so must get rid of it to eliminate the risk.

I'm going to take a guess at what he's trying to say:

"As if the hunters are going to say that they nail foxes to a bench as they want the public to support them and not condem them, mean while you believe the hunters when they say they care for the animals
Hmmmmmmm i....... i.i cant put my finger on what is rong with this pic hmmmm some one help me please " (this last part I have no idea but I think he might sarcastically be asking what is wrong with the picture)

Yes, I was saying that golf still counts as a sport despite most of the time spent there not actually spent doin exercise. This was to counter an argument that horse riding during a hunt is not a sport because so much time is spent sitting around on a horse chatting to one another. We were not at this point debating other reasons why it may not be a sport, do pay attention.

But surely there are more humane ways of doing this, instead of ripping them apart.

I used to live on a farm where we had a lot of chickens, and quite a few foxes in the area. The chickens were let lose during the day and at night we'd put them inside a huge barn which had a fenced in area outside leading up to it. Here we just places a small wire with electric shock in it around the outside of the fence so that the fox couldn't dig under it. Most chicken sheds used on farms which only have enough chickens for piravte use will have a door you can close and it's not a big effort to do every night. The electrical wire takes about 5min to place. And the larger farms usually keeps the chickens inside anyway.

This is all true, but no matter how much you try to keep a fox out, they can still find a way in if they want to. The wires may break and stop being electrified, or the walls in a part of the shed may be damaged in a storm. The only surefire way of stopping foxes is to not have any foxes around, and the hunt is the traditional way of dealing with them.
 
 
 
Yes, I was saying that golf still counts as a sport despite most of the time spent there not actually spent doin exercise. This was to counter an argument that horse riding during a hunt is not a sport because so much time is spent sitting around on a horse chatting to one another. We were not at this point debating other reasons why it may not be a sport, do pay attention.

 

I'm guessing sporting fox hunting and >normal IQs do not go hand in hand....
Golf is a sport regardless of exercise due to the competitive nature and scoring system.
Fox hunting has none of the above and **** all exercise. Therefore fox hunting is in no way a sport.

Do you not consider riding a horse to be exercise? It most definitely is.

Maybe we were just lucky, but the wire didn't break once in the 6 years we had chickens, it wasn't a big expense to replace and the ferret was a much bigger lose because those also find a way in, much more so than foxes, and they infact kill as many chickens as they can, where as a fox usually brings it's prey back to it's burrow. Foxes are fairly easy to keep away from your chickens, but ferrets aren't but I have never heard so traditional ferret hunts.

Also, although it may be tradition it doesn't really justify the method in my eyes. People were traditionally stoned as a practise of punishment. But that doesn't make the act accepted in a modern society, nor do I believe fox hunting should be just because it is practised against another species than our own.

(Not sure they are called ferrets, I think they are, but correct me please if they are not)

Yeh ferret is correct. You can hunt ferrets, just in a different way. It is one of the purposes jack russels are bred for, going down ferret holes to either get them or chase them out.

The thing with the tradition argument is that I feel it sad we are losing so many of our traditions, and it is a wonderful spectacle to behold a hunt riding off across the field. It may be barbaric, but in my view humans are fairly barbaric creatures, which is where all these traditions came from.

But surely a tradition shouldn't be kept if it's not justified. I can understand people wanting to keep certain things that makes their country different (even if I personally don't care the peice of land I'm born on). But with the amount of suffering these foxes are put through I don't view tradition as a good enough reason to practise it. The rides can surely still continue, just without the purpose of killing animals is a horrible way.

In Denmark it used to be tradition to go riding and kill animals, for sport, fun, tradition, whatever. But is rarely practised anymore, as far as I'm aware fox hunting with dogs is illegal. But people still part take in yearly hunts where differenty obsticles are set up. It's more of a sporty social thing now.

You make a very valid point about the human nature, but if we have been able to distance ourself from other barbaric rituals, why not this one?
 
 
 http://www.brighthub.com/pets/exotic...les/87206.aspx 
If you're at all interrested in what it's like to have a pet fox.  

On the subject of traditions, why not focus on all the other traditions that are kept and odn't harm anyone instead. Old dances, music, food, language, literature and artists. Keeping things like that alive is much more important in my opinion, than the right to hunt down and burtally end a living beings life.

You are right it is illegal to kill the fox with hounds anymore, but it is still legal to chase the fox and then shoot it, which is less barbaric I'm sure you agree. The rides still continue, often with drag hunts (see the episode of top gear where they hunt a daihatsu terios).

We may have distanced ourselves from other rituals, but i question why we have? Why are we denying our human nature?

I agree that it's less barbaric if people are decent shots, but it's still not something I support since I still see it as inneccessary.

I'm going ot go watch a film with my little brother.  
 
 
I also live in the "proper countryside" (Dorset). You can shoot them if you really must, but I think killing as a sport is disgusting and inhuman.

(countryside, against)
 
 
So 65% of people are against fox hunting overall, roughly 40% of people that live in the countryside support it while only 31% of people that live in a town/city support it.
 
 
 
Please learn to speak proper english, I can barely understand you. That picture is a pro hunting picture because many horses are kept primarily for the purpose of hunting, and without hunting they would not be kept, and would so be killed. This is even more true of the hounds, as they cannot be trained as domestic pets once trained as a killing machine.

 

oh comon dont be a grammer nazi. the horeses they can be looked after like normal horses the hounds go in for the kill when told by the hunter
 
 
I live in a small town but there are a lot of rural villages around and I live next to a huge expanse of fields, so I see myself as being more from the country than the city. Either way I'm against people killing for pleasure. It's pretty disturbing.

I'm not being a grammar nazi, but your english is godawful. The hounds cannot be retrained, they are simply too vicious, and so must be killed. The horse was used for the campaign because a dead horse lying in the street is more obvious than a dead dog.

We have population problems in London. Therefore, humans need to be killed. Since they need to be killed anyway, let's make it entertaining and throw them in a cage with a hungry lion.
 
 
 
i got more for ya amego

 

These are just pictures of dead foxes, you have no idea who killed them and by what means. I have found so many times the last resort of antis are to post horrific pictures of dead animals and expect us to take it all as fact.

I know you mean well but the pictures prove nothing. Do you even know how the horse died?

Hunting with dogs is illegal, taking the dogs out for a run and shooting a fox isn't. Face it the ban came in and no one is enforcing it, what does that tell you?

There is a large element of luck in monopoly - the dice.
Chess has tournaments and a very deep level of skill.
Golf has a large element of skill and competition.

Fox hunting has no competitive nature, no scoring system, and very little skill involved. If it was one guy vs the fox with nothing more than a spear, sure. But it's not.
 
 
For if it's for genuine culling.
Against if it's for sport.

Monopoly has high levels of skill required - and there is a high level of luck involved in pretty much all sport.

Hell sport comes from the French desport - which means leisure. It's defined by Roget's as "activity engaged in for relaxation and amusement" with synonyms of diversion an recreation. I think fox hunting fits the Bill.

Oh yeah, it's like the game risk; there is strategy, but far shallower than something like chess and far more luck based thanks to dice.
 
 
 
Firstly, let me say again that killing foxes (or indeed, anything) isn't where my issue lies when the animal dies for good cause. If it's deemed that the fox population needs to be controlled then I'd support a cull; if foxes are killed because a few farms have lost chickens then I'd have an issue with it. We're the more intelligent species, we/farmers should think of better ways to protect livestock. The foxes are merely doing what their instinct tells them to do.

Secondly, the method of killing foxes. IF it's judged that hunting with dogs is the best, most efficient and least traumatic way of killing a fox (I'm yet to be convinced of this, btw) then so be it. But it cannot be denied that this experience for the fox is highly traumatic and unnatural. As a predator, a fox is not designed to be chased or hunted, it is not born with the fear/instinct that 'prey' animals have. It's chased to exhaustion and then ripped to pieces - I do not for one second believe that this is something that should be enjoyed. So, if some people are willing to get dressed up and celebrate it then by my standards, there is something barbaric about these people. It leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth at the very least.

Nevertheless we don't know if other methods of culling foxes is more efficient in the countryside because they've never been implemented. In the town, it's pretty easy to lure in even the most timid fox and shoot it, I don't see why the same can't apply in the countryside.

 

in terms of other methods of killing foxes... you'll need a good marksman to make sure the fox is shot sufficiently as to kill it quickly without further suffering.
 
 
 
What you need to get into your skull is the basic fact that causing pain to animals is cruel, even more so when you take pleasure from this.
*cough* Sadist *cough*

 

Why is it cruel?
 
 
 
Socialising around the event of killing an animal. Why don't you just chuck in an ancient deity and call it a sacrifice?  

 

This is such an utterly ridiculous argument. It is highly amusing that it is all you have to be honest. It is akin to saying that a group of exterminators destroying a wasps nest is exactly the same as an ancient sacrifice.

Here is a tip for you. Drop the emotive analogy and try to debate like a grown up.  

 
She should have made a better chicken pen then....Sucks but it is what happens...
 

Seeing as you enjoy emotive analogy I will construct one of my own.

I am a serial killer and have just broken into your house and slaughtered your family. You should have made a better house..... Sucks but it is what happens.

Ridiculous as that is, hopefully it will open your eyes to what your posts look like to the rest of us.  
 
 
 
For it and live in the city.

There seem to be alot of disqust with specifically dogs killing the foxes. I'm pretty sure its quicker and more humane for dogs, that bred through generations of killers to dispose of it as to some toff with a rifle. As to catching the fox and killing it humanely, that seems equally as difficult. How do you catch a fox without dogs?

But anyway there are greater injustices in the world.

 

I'm pretty sure that if the farmers round here could only get rid of foxes by shooting them, they would soon be very adept at it and do it in a thoroughly business-like manner, and would be quite able to distinguish a breeding vixen from a mangy old dog chicken rustler.

I know someone who shoots rabbits (for the pot) with a.22 air rifle. He only uses head shots. Surely a fox is going to be easier than that?
 
 
The local village (where I play cricket), Gargrave, was where the first illegal hunt took place. I'm all for it! Yorkshire pride.
 
 
Against it. From a semi rural villiage, so not really city and not really countryside.
I just see it as disgusting barbarism.

 
But I don't have the right to enforce that view upon others. It infuriates me that the labour government, for no reason other than class hatred and spite attacked a culture that they disagree with and banned it.

 

It has nothing to do with culture.
Murdering animals is not a cultue.
And even if it was, cultures still come under our laws and principles.
If a group of people lived here said it was their culture to kill random humans, you wouldn't have a problem with that would you?

 
For hunting - people from the town don't realise the pain that foxes cause. I live on a farm and the foxes are a constant pain terrorises our livestock and have killed so many of our chickens. Also, the hounds do not maul the fox - they simply grab it and then it is shot by the hunt.

 

If its for that reason, then why make it into a sport? There is no need. Just round up the fox and get rid of it quickly and without and fuss. No need for all the crap sport stuff that goes with it.

 
Why is it cruel?

 

Killing something for a sport / for fun is by its very nature cruel. I am surprised anyone has to ask why.
 
 
From Manchester. Don't really care but we should be able to hunt animals if we want it's actually more natural than pretending we are some kind of stewards watching over the animal kingdom. Animals kill each other deal with it.

This is a strawman. What is and what isn't cruel is quite obviously subjective from person to person. I am asking you why you think it is cruel to kill an animal for pleasure. You have yet to offer any kind of substantial explanation to back up your claim.

Nope it isn't. You are asking why killing a living being is cruel. A human is a living being.
And why? Because you are causing pain and suffering and death just for fun. That is why it is cruel. Doing that is wrong no matter what the living being is.
You wouldn't go to your neigbours cat and kill it for no reason other than for your own pleasure would you? (and if you would, then I suggest you seek mental help).
 
 
 
And why? Because you are causing pain and suffering and death just for fun.

 

You still haven't told me why this is cruel. All you are doing is stating that it is cruel. You are making an assertion without substantiating it.

If your contention is that causing pain and suffering is in itself cruel then how do you justify or even begin to explain the widescale pain and suffering of animals in and as a result of our society at this present moment. Pain and suffering which you implicitly contribute to.

I would also contend that it isn't 'just' for fun. Fox hunting has inherent utility. It serves a purpose and fuels an industry regardless of how efficient you deem it to be.

Now, if your contention is about causing pain and suffering 'just' for fun. Then that contention applies to any industry in which the slaughter of animals is involved. A hunter on one of these hunts could glean as much enjoyment as a youth working in a slaughter house putting bolts in the heads of cows and watching them die. Or shocking and opening a pig. Are you a vegan? Have you sworn off any and all products which derive from such industry? If not, then your attack on fox hunting is entirely disingenuous, the type of slaughter and wanton cruelty that exists in the meat and livestock industry relegates fox hunting to irrelevance in terms of barbarism.

Oh and before you start going on like all the others have about how we don't eat the fox. It doesn't matter. What matters is that the killing of these animals has utility and serves a distinct purpose. Livestock for food, foxes for pest control. (Which in actuality is done to protect livestock, go figure.)
 
 
 
It doesn't matter.

 

Sorry to cut down all your post to that, but it DOES matter.
Killing an animal for food in essentially a factory method is a million miles removed from killing an animal for fun as a sport. It is a huge difference and it certainly does matter.

As for your other points:
1 - Yes it is "just for fun". There are other methods of controlling the fox population. Hell, hunt them if you really have to. But its the whole being a spot and being "fun" bit that I have a problem with.
2 - No I am not a vegan, but that point is pretty much addressed above. There is a massive difference.

Please can you explain to me the difference? Remember that it is not just for sport, it serves a purpose as pest control.

Then answer this instead of blatantly dodging it. I have adressed your posts, the least you could do is adress mine.

Well no it isn't, the end product is the same and really we don't need to eat meat anymore. How is it different to kill a fox for fun and to sit and eat a really good steak? That cow was still killed so you could enjoy a good meal.

Trying to be objective, are there moral norms that we can agree?
Animals do not have 'rights' since they cannot have responsibilities: no responsibility, no right. Nevertheless, we owe all living things, sentient or otherwise a duty of care since we are the self appointed 'ruling species' supposedly superior in intelligence even to dolphins and chimpanzees (see above). Where we place ourselves on the spectrum of how we treat living things wrt our own pleasure is PART of the measure of our humanity; I would commit genicide on ground elder to make my garden look better, I would kill an animal or fish in order to eat it if I knew it tasted good but at the same time would prefer that the animal had been treated decently while it was still alive, I would not kill a gorilla to make it's hands into ashtrays or an elephant for it's teeth and four novelty umbrella stands. I would enjoy watching horses ridden with skill and courage in a setting which takes the welfare of the horse seriously and would enjoy watching greyhounds race, which they love to do. I would not enjoy seeing horses being ridden pell-mell across country following a pack of hounds baying for the blood of a fox that they had been put on, or watch greyhounds being set against a hair in a field to see how fast and nimbly they destroy it, or a terrior in a pit of rats to see how many it can kill.
I suppose that puts me somewhere on the spectrum - perhaps nearer to one end or the other. Where are you?

Go back and read my post. An individual is faced with myriad oppurtunities to enjoy killing animals. All he has to do is get a job at an abbatoir and he can slaughter thousands. Please explain to me the difference. Your point above is stunted and hardly a point at all.

Stating that it is a million miles without explaining WHY it is a million miles removed makes me think you do not know why, and you do not really know whaqt you are talking about. Prove me wrong.

You accept that killing foxes for reasons other than food is fine.

However, if someone were to enjoy that, it makes it a bad thing?

What is it?

 

My point is that killing an animal for food in essentially a factory setting is very different to conducting a sport to kill an animal because it is a pest. If you can't see that difference, then I am sorry. But for the rest of us, that different is pretty damn huge.

If some sick idiot gets kicks from working in an abbatoir, then it doesn't really matter as the animal would still be killed in the same way whatever.
But with fox hunting, there is no need for the sport aspect. No need at all.

I'll address the rest of your points later on.
 
 
I am against it.

The debate around fox hunting is very strongly politicised and it's a class debate just as much as an animal ethics debate.

For example: take the sport of Urban Fox Hunting. Gangs of chavs taking their dogs around central London to rip up Foxes.
When this got into the news there was a moral outrage, it was branded 'sickening' by the newspapers. Mindless animal cruelty for fun. There were calls for the chavs to be prosecuted for animal cruelty.
Yet when a lot of wealthy people dress up in their red coats to go a-riding 'pon their horses with cute beagles, it's a tradition that should be upheld, isn't cruel and is beneficial to the countryside.
Contradiction much?

Oh for goodness sake, you know the urban foxhunting was a massive hoax right?
 
 
 
Hang on.

I think its a bad thing to purposly go about the load of crap, purposly worsen the pain and suffering, just so some sick ****ers can get a kick out of killing something.

 
Well no it isn't, the end product is the same and really we don't need to eat meat anymore. How is it different to kill a fox for fun and to sit and eat a really good steak? That cow was still killed so you could enjoy a good meal.

 

I can't explain it, but there just is. If you kill an animal for meat, it has a purpose. Killing it for fun does not. Of course, with fox hunting sometimes it does have a purpose. But I do not feel all the pompous sport aspect of it is needed. Just get rid of the thing if you must, and that is that. You don't need to ****ing chase it around for hours and end and then let it get ripped to shreds.

The important thing is what it says about the nature of that individual. Is that to be encouraged? It's like advising a wannabe slasher, "Why don't you just become a cosmetic surgeon?"
 
 
I wonder what it's like living in the countryside  
 
 
 
Trying to be objective, are there moral norms that we can agree?
Animals do not have 'rights' since they cannot have responsibilities: no responsibility, no right.

 

I wouldn't necessarily agree with this. Rights can be bestowed as and when we please.

 
Nevertheless, we owe all living things, sentient or otherwise a duty of care since we are the self appointed 'ruling species' supposedly superior in intelligence even to dolphins and chimpanzees (see above).
 

Again I would contend this. I don't see how us being at the top of the food chain necessitates a duty of care. Certainly that is admirable but given the current reality and a large scale demand for food at competitive prices. It isn't really going to happen.

However I completely agree with you on this issue. But that is not my point. My point is that, if one were to take this position, there are far more pressing issues than fox hunting, which, relatively kills a negligible amount of animals and the cruelty that exists as part of it pales in comparison to large scale industry. Hence my calling the other users disingenuous and emotive.

 
Where we place ourselves on the spectrum of how we treat living things wrt our own pleasure is PART of the measure of our humanity; I would commit genicide on ground elder to make my garden look better, I would kill an animal or fish in order to eat it if I knew it tasted good but at the same time would prefer that the animal had been treated decently while it was still alive, I would not kill a gorilla to make it's hands into ashtrays or an elephant for it's teeth and four novelty umbrella stands.
 

Would you kill a Gorrila for ashtrays if, for instance the money you spent and contributed to the hunting industry in a certain part of Africa stopped the locals from slaughtering these creatures en masse for food with far more ignoble methods?

 
I would not enjoy seeing horses being ridden pell-mell across country following a pack of hounds baying for the blood of a fox that they had been put on, or watch greyhounds being set against a hair in a field to see how fast and nimbly they destroy it, or a terrior in a pit of rats to see how many it can kill.
 

Would you enjoy seeing the fox maimed in a trap? Or stuck in a humane trap, dehydrated, starving, terrified until the time when it is blown to pieces?

All I am saying is that emotive reverse snobbery has far more to do with peoples opinions on this issue than cruelty to animals. I would highly recommend everyone visit an abbatoir before getting involved in such an irellevent issue as fox hunting. The same goes for many other blood sports.
 
 
 
Oh for goodness sake, you know the urban foxhunting was a massive hoax right?

 

Yes, the point was that the outrage was real.

TBH if you cant coherantly explain why you are against something you shouldn't be trying to make a point in this thread. "Just because" isnt a reason.

It doesn't matter if they wear a red coat or a wax jacket the fox is still dead at the end. You are either for killing animals for our own benefits or against, you can't pick and choose which animals are worthy of saving just because you liek chicken nuggets.

So, whats the point?

  If the difference is so obvious then explain it to me!

Essentially, we are killing an animal to serve an economic purpose. Why is the method of killing relevant.

 
If some sick idiot gets kicks from working in an abbatoir, then it doesn't really matter as the animal would still be killed in the same way whatever.
But with fox hunting, there is no need for the sport aspect. No need at all.
 

No, you said that animals should not be caused pain or killed for enjoyment. Now you suddenly acknowledge that in fact it is ok. So do you redact your point and concede that you were wrong? Because evidently you do not mind if somebody enjoys killing hundreds of animals. Your contention evidently isn't because fox hunting is more cruel because relatively it isn't. Livestock is bred into awful conditions and is forced to live in them until the day it is slaughtered. The death of a fox on a hunt is quick and painless in comparison. It is also quicker and less traumatic than a professional fox trap.

So thus your argument is reduced to the fact that these individuals wear shiny read coats and blow horns. Which is, as I have always said just a classist issue. At least admit that.

I'd have to disagree.
Killing animals for food is not the same as killing for a sport. If you kill them for food they are serving a purpose, feeding us and keeping us healthy (plus it's natural to do so); but killing them for sport (and saying they are pests isn't a good reason, they should just put better defenses up around their chickens) isn't the same thing because it's not natural, it's not healthy and so there is no reasonable explination for doing so.

Then to repeat the same thing again, what is natural? Why cant we chase prey? Why is keeping animals in disgusting condions for the sake of farming better then chasing down a fox once or twice a month?

You don't need meat to be healthy so why are battery hens morally justifyable or, indeed, natural?

Let's not bring battery farming into this, because that's not the point. I'm completely against any farms that treat animals badly (I've posted a lot on the "why aren't you vegan" thread about where I get my meat).
Hunting for food - yes. But that's not what fox hunting is. Hunting for a sport, just to kill, there is no need for it and it's wrong.
 
 
 
Well that isnt a point its a statement...

 

A point is a statement you...fng.

Ok...well thankyou for adding to the discussion.
 
 
 
How can it be shot straight away when there are dogs in the way? A hunt is not a humane way of killing foxes. Shoot the foxes, protect chickens, hunting is not a terribly successful way of killing foxes anyway.

 

 
WE, people of the town, are very annoyed with the foxes as they wake us up at 1 or 2 am every night and cry so loud it scares the **** out of you, for real! Also eat the bin bags and destroy the bin, spreading rubbish all over the street and we have to clean it up in the morning, they also attack the cats and when I used to have a dog i could NEVER sleep at night because the fox would come into the garden and my dog would start barking all night long. Grrrrr I agree with the b_adam they that just because the foxes get haunted it doesnt mean that there will be any molding, i dont know what this crazy story is about of the girls smearing fox's blood onto children but definitely this is not what happens when foxes get haunted, they get shot. thats it! I would love to be able to enjoy my nights sleep without listening to foxes crying or ****ing each other < which they do and it sounds utterly nasty :s

I don't ignore that it exists. I'm completely against it, but it's pretty irrelevent when we're discussing fox hunting!

A statement isn't necessarily a point though, which was the point he was making.

 
 
 
 
you can't pick and choose which animals are worthy of saving just because you liek chicken nuggets.

 

It isn't about picking and choosing the animals.
I'd feel the same about "chicken hunting" if it existed.
If we need to kill animals, then whatever. But you don't need to make a ****ing sport out of it.
 
 
 
I think its a bad thing to purposly go about the load of crap, purposly worsen the pain and suffering, just so some sick ****ers can get a kick out of killing something.

 

That's an entirely different argument. Your problem is with the worsening of the pain and suffering.

After all, if there was no more pain to the fox, and people enjoyed themselves - is that not a better situation than the same amount of pain dealt to the fox and an entirely miserable time taking them out (nothing is worse off, and some things are better off). You seemed to be advocating that the latter was preferable to the former.

 
I can't explain it, but there just is. If you kill an animal for meat, it has a purpose. Killing it for fun does not.
 

You, uh, just contradicted yourself there. The purpose is 'for fun', whether you deem that a worthy one is again, another argument.
 
 
I'm all for hunting for necessity, food and the sort. But I am entirely against the idea of recreational hunting with particular regard to trophy hunting.
 
 
 
Essentially, we are killing an animal to serve an economic purpose. Why is the method of killing relevant.

 

Because it is relevant. There is simply no need for the "sport" part. If you are going to kill it, just ****ing kill it.

 
No, you said that animals should not be caused pain or killed for enjoyment.

 

No I didn't. I said that the main purpose shouldn't be for enjoyment, and any killing that is necessary shouldn't be about enjoyment (which I am sorry, but the "sport" aspect of fox hunting IS about).

 
So thus your argument is reduced to the fact that these individuals wear shiny read coats and blow horns. Which is, as I have always said just a classist issue. At least admit that.

 

Except it isn't classist. It is partly about the pompous bull**** of it, but that isn't about class. I'd feel the same if it was a working class, or middle class thing. My problem is there is simply no need. If you are going to kill the thing, then just do it. There is no need for the sport bull****.
 
 
 
That's an entirely different argument. Your problem is with the worsening of the pain and suffering.

 

My problem is with all of it.
The worsening of the pain and suffering, the fact people go about for hours enjoying the killing of an animal, the fact that there is all the sport bull**** for no reason at all. As I have said, if you are going to kill it, just ****ing kill it.

 
You, uh, just contradicted yourself there. The purpose is 'for fun', whether you deem that a worthy one is again, another argument.

 

No I didn't. Killing something for fun is not a reason for killing something.

So you have a problem with others enjoying themselves, even if there is no more harm to anyone or anything else?

 
No I didn't. Killing something for fun is not a reason for killing something.
 

"Why did you kill it? For fun."

It by definition is a reason. Like I said, whether you deem it an acceptable reason is a whole different argument.

You can't kill something without there being any harm.
And granted that is what I mean, but any sane person will say that killing something for fun is not acceptable. If you enjoy killing something, then there is something wrong with you. There are clear links between people who hurt and kill animals and those who hurt and kill humans.

But there is more harm, and it's unecessary anyway.
 
 
 
Because it is relevant. There is simply no need for the "sport" part. If you are going to kill it, just ****ing kill it.

 

But that is exactly what they are doing. So to recap.

1. We have established that regardless of the method, the animal is killed.

2. You agree that as long as the kill has economic utility that is ok.

3. That the hunt is probably the most humane way to kill foxes. It is so gaudy and inefficient that no professional extermination business would grant the fox such a relatively quick death. Instead they would traumatise, starve and dehydrate it for an extended period of time before exploding it with a shotgun.

4. Enjoyment gleaned from the kill is ok as long as the kill has an eocnomic purpose. (ou admitted this last post.)

As you say above, your problem is with them wearing red coats and blowing horns. Your problem is with this certain tradition or sport.

 
No I didn't. I said that the main purpose shouldn't be for enjoyment, and any killing that is necessary shouldn't be about enjoyment (which I am sorry, but the "sport" aspect of fox hunting IS about).
 

I say again, what if somebody applies for a job at the abbatoir purely because they enjoy killing?

What if somebody joins a hunt because they want to destroy a pest and in fact hate killing animals. But recognise it as the most realistic and least cruel method to eliminate a problem?

Doesn't this utterly dismantle your point?

 
Except it isn't classist. It is partly about the pompous bull**** of it, but that isn't about class.
 

You have just contradicted yourself.
 
 
Against-because it is done as sport.

Culling is a different story though.
 
 
 
You can't kill something without there being any harm.
And granted that is what I mean, but any sane person will say that killing something for fun is not acceptable. If you enjoy killing something, then there is something wrong with you. There are clear links between people who hurt and kill animals and those who hurt and kill humans.

 

It's relative. If foxes need to be killed anyway (as you accepted) then it's about any extra pain or suffering.

What you're saying is that despite there being no extra harm to anyone or thing, you'd ban people having fun merely because you frown upon their morality. Why should you impose your morality upon everyone else, who is doing no more harm than you accept is necessary?
 
 
 
But that is exactly what they are doing. So to recap.

 

But they aren't. They make a huge ****ing show and sport out of it. There is no need.

 
You have just contradicted yourself.

 

No I haven't. It has nothing to do with class. I couldn't give a **** about the class of the people. Its the actions that I have a problem with.

So you are trying to say chasing a fox for hours and then letting it get ripped apart by dogs is not causing extra pain or suffering? Really?
As for the bit about morality, don't we do that as a society anyway? We think rape is wrong so we say it is illegal. Or would you support people being able to do anything they wanted?

It depends on the alternative, but like I said, that's not my argument - your bizarre chain of reasoning is.

No, we can say rape is morally wrong because of the harm caused to others, just as murder, theft, fraud, assault all cause harm to others - and thus should be outlawed.

To give you an example, it would be like me banning supporting Cardiff City, because I don't like them - not because of the harm caused to others by supporting Cardiff City - simply because I disapprove of you having fun by supporting them.
 
 
 
It depends on the alternative, but like I said, that's not my argument - your bizarre chain of reasoning is.

 

I don't see how my reasoning is "bizarre". Fox hunting promotes pompous sport and enjoyment around the killing of an animal. It draws it out and it is all unnecessary. If you are going to kill it, just kill it. There is no need for the sport stuff.

 
No, we can say rape is morally wrong because of the harm caused to others.

And enjoying killing something is morally wrong because of the harm caused to the animal (and arguably the human too - someone who enjoys killing things must be messed up). As I said, there is a clear link between enjoying pain and death of animals and the same of humans.
 
 
 
But they aren't. They make a huge ****ing show and sport out of it. There is no need.

 

So to conclude our argument. You have shown that your problem is not with the death of the fox itself, it is not with the cruelty, it is not with somebody enjoying the death of an animal.

It is with the fact that a certain group of individuals have turned it into a sport.

Let me ask you a question. If an extermination agency put a league table up on their company notice board, logging who got the most kills and offering prizes to the winner. (Or bonuses/commision) Would you have a problem with it?
 
 
 
I don't see how my reasoning is "bizarre". Fox hunting promotes pompous sport and enjoyment around the killing of an animal. It draws it out and it is all unnecessary. If you are going to kill it, just kill it. There is no need for the sport stuff.

 

What's wrong with the sport stuff though? Yes, you might not like it, but if it causes no harm to anything or one else, and gives some pleasure, why should you be able to impose your personal, subjective morality upon everyone else. You want to ban it because it's fun, blimey.

Hello thought crime!

Yes, it might be messed up, I don't particularly like the activity either - and I haven't and wouldn't partake in it. However, that doesn't mean I think it should be banned. Until someone commits that harm, why should they be prosecuted? Or shall we lock people up for thinking about theft?

It causes much harm to foxes.

*sigh*

Firstly, you must compare it to the alternatives. Secondly, I'm not arguing about that, I'm arguing about a hypothetical for now. The issue here is the wider reasoning, not the narrow issue of fox hunting. Your post misses the point, which is why I ignored the first time you interjected.

I don't think there's any good reason for killing foxes. If they're eating your chickens, secure your chickens better.

Its to do with all of it put together.
The sport stuff is just the tip of the iceberg.

And I am sorry, but that comparison is just stupid.
1 - It doesn't draw it out or cause any extra suffering (like chasing a fox and then letting it get ripped to pieces does).
2 - Its really isn't in the same category. If the "huntsmen" killed the foxes quickly and humanly, but had a leaderboard, then I wouldn't care.

But it does cause harm. There are other ways of quickly killing the fox without having to chase it around and without having it ripped to shreds.

Not thought crime at all. Fox hunting is illegal. This it is a real crime.
Where did I say people should be locked up before they did something? I didn't.
I said that enjoying animal cruelty and killing often leads to the same person enjoying human cruelty and killing.
 
 
 
*sigh*

I think the alternatives stack up pretty well to chasing a fox around for hours and then it getting ripped to shreds.
 
 
They eat my chickens.
 
 
 
I don't think there's any good reason for killing foxes. If they're eating your chickens, secure your chickens better.

 

So why is it justifiable to kill male calves or cockerels - both of which not for food, and not foxes?

Furthermore, even if it is for food, you consider it justifiable to keep animals in captivity for their whole lives (yes, even free range chicken is held within borders), purposefully fattening them and making the whole purpose of their life to be killed?

It's ok to exterminate wasps if there's a wasps nest in your house? Bees? Cockroaches? What if your timber frame house has woodworm? Build a better house?!

I presume none of the things I've mentioned are justifiable, else you are entirely inconsistent.

Shooting, gassing, snaring and poisoning a fox is far less humane than a short chase followed by a trained kill, with almost immediate death from the 'nip' to the back of the fox's head, it's what hounds are trained to do. Unless you hit with a head shot 100% of the time, you're being less humane.

As for the chase, the average hunt lasts 17 minutes, and the fox doesn't anticipate death.

However, that's entirely besides the point I was arguing or wished to argue with you. It was with your reasoning that the bit that was wrong was it being a sport, not to do with harm to the fox or any such consideration.

 
Not thought crime at all. Fox hunting is illegal. This it is a real crime.
 

...

 
Where did I say people should be locked up before they did something? I didn't.

Yes, and thinking about theft often leads to theft. It's exactly the same logic, prosecuting on the possibility of harm rather than harm itself. The fact that you support one and not the other shows only your internal inconsistency.
 
 
 
Its to do with all of it put together.
The sport stuff is just the tip of the iceberg.

And I am sorry, but that comparison is just stupid.
1 - It doesn't draw it out or cause any extra suffering (like chasing a fox and then letting it get ripped to pieces does).

 

Of course it would cause extra suffering. An exterminator may lay more traps to get a higher score, which would mean that the fox would have to be trapped in an exceptionally small space starving, terrified and dehydrated for far longer until it is shot. Animals trapped in these things have been known to gnaw limbs off in terror. There is also no chance of escape, wheras in a hunt there is. Also there is the wider enviroment to consider, foxes will be the only thing hunted in the sport you detest, and yet the traps do not discriminate and far more things will be killed in the process. In comparison a hunt is far more preferable wouldn't you say?

So we are back to your argument being wholly a problem with the pomp and circumstance of the thing. In which case it fails.

 
2 - Its really isn't in the same category. If the "huntsmen" killed the foxes quickly and humanly, but had a leaderboard, then I wouldn't care.
 

I have already established that the hunt is a far quicker and more humane way to kill a fox. Have you any idea what you are talking about? Have you seen industrial traps for foxes and other pests? Are you aware of the damage this causes to the enviroement and other life forms? Seriously the hunt comes out on top every time.

Stop trying to make this about cruelty or morality. Your argument is full of holes, hence the reason why it is being torn to pieces with ease.

It isn't justifiable to kill male calves and cockerels in my eyes.

Keeping an animal within boarders where it is happy and enjoys life is fine, as long as they are killed painlessly at the end to serve their purpose as food. This is not the same as hunting down a fox, causing it immense destress and having it harmed and ripped apart by dogs, causing a great deal of suffering BEFORE it is killed. Causing it suffering is wrong, and killing for no good reason, when there are other things that can be done is also wrong.

It's only okay to exterminate bugs if it is detrimental to your health and there is no other way. We had an ants nest in our wall once, but left it since it caused no harm.
 
 
 
I don't ignore that it exists. I'm completely against it, but it's pretty irrelevent when we're discussing fox hunting!

 

No it isn't, you are against animal suffering, battery farms result in suffering.
 
 
 
It isn't about picking and choosing the animals.
I'd feel the same about "chicken hunting" if it existed.
If we need to kill animals, then whatever. But you don't need to make a ****ing sport out of it.

 

But why does it matter if its a sport if the end result is the same  
 
 
 
 
WE, people of the town, are very annoyed with the foxes as they wake us up at 1 or 2 am every night and cry so loud it scares the **** out of you, for real! Also eat the bin bags and destroy the bin, spreading rubbish all over the street and we have to clean it up in the morning, they also attack the cats and when I used to have a dog i could NEVER sleep at night because the fox would come into the garden and my dog would start barking all night long. Grrrrr I agree with the b_adam they that just because the foxes get haunted it doesnt mean that there will be any molding, i dont know what this crazy story is about of the girls smearing fox's blood onto children but definitely this is not what happens when foxes get haunted, they get shot. thats it! I would love to be able to enjoy my nights sleep without listening to foxes crying or ****ing each other < which they do and it sounds utterly nasty :s

 

 
That is an argument for shooting foxes, not ripping them to shreds with dogs.

I don't really understand what you've said sorry.
 
 
Can we all stop using the term "ripping it to shreds" its not particularly accurate.
 
 
PLEASEEEEEE KILL ALL THE FOXES i really hate them....they are so dangerous....ahhhh

or at least get them out of towns
 
 
 
PLEASEEEEEE KILL ALL THE FOXES i really hate them....they are so dangerous....ahhhh

 

*******s to that.

I was walking home from the station in Leicester last week, in the middle of a park, and a fox walked right past me about a foot away, and just looked at me and carried on. The worst that 99.99% of urban foxes will do is **** on your lawn.

Now, the fox population needs to be controlled if we're going to continue to manage the countryside rather than restore the ecosystem that once kept foxes in check (foxes are now an apex predator - we'd need wolves and bears back for a natural ecosystem, as well as huge reforestation) but foxes are not particularly dangerous to humans. Even with the rising fox population we haven't seen a correspondent huge rise in fox attacks nor have we seen a particularly serious increase in losses of livestock.

I live on the urban fringe (about a minute away from open fields) and I don't really have that strong an opinion either way, but to put it simply I am for control, but I am against hunting. If you want to control the population, trap them rather than chase them.

Trapping is more cruel though.
 
 
how do you know that there isn't a rise in fox attacks now theres more foxes?....my friend got attacked by a fox last year since then when i see one i have a mini heart attack....scary animals

Fox attacks are rare because foxes are quite small, the largest red fox on record weighed 12kg, and humans are considerably bigger, making them an illogical target unless the fox is frightened or trapped.
 
 
Live in a countryside area - although I live on the outskirts of a small town personally.

I absolutely see the need for fox control, however my views on fox hunting are that:
It is not the most effective method of fox control - I have had quite a bit to do with shooting (I only ever shoot paper targets at approved ranges, but I am aware of people who use their guns for fox culling purposes as permitted by the law) over the years and I believe that shooting is considerably more effective than hunting with dogs. I accept that trapping is also effective, however I think that this is extremely cruel.

Fox call devices can be used to lure foxes which can then be shot (or meat can be used as a bait), and it is possible to shoot many foxes in the course of one evening like this - no pomp, no ceremony, just the fox being dispatched effectively and quickly by the hunter. There are always going to be cases in which foxes suffer injuries that are not fatal and which regrettably result in a drawn-out death, however this is very much not the norm and measures can be taken to reduce this (the use of a spotlamp to stun the fox and illuminate it, giving the marksman much better chances of an effective and humane shot - as well as the use of expanding bullets).

Hunting with dogs is not that effective - I've never heard a shooter talk about how few foxes he's shot, but I have heard stories of fox hunts which are grossly ineffective - so how the hunts can claim to be super-effective killing machines, I have no idea

Foxes are natural predators and it is not in their natural instinct to be prey - the experience of being chased down by a hunt determined to make as much song and dance as possible will be an intensely traumatic and frightening experience, rather than a pre-conditioned natural response (such as when a bird darts off when you scare it by coming too close). Compared to some of the awful stuff that farmers and gamekeepers get up to with traps, 10-60 seconds of trauma at the hands of the hounds doesn't rank particularly highly on the list of global animal suffering, but it does still represent a cruel, and (for a fox) unnatural method of killing.

Hunting with dogs creates unnecessary pomp and ceremony associated with pest control. Pest control which is something that I think we should see a necessity in a human-dominated ecosystem with unnatural concentrations of plants and livestock, but I don't think that it should be something which we see as deserving of such colourful and elaborate celebration with bizarre, almost tribalistic displays such as the act of smearing the blood of a dead fox upon a child at a fox hunt

The argument that fox hunting being banned has caused economic turmoil is exceptionally weak - structural unemployment (unemployment caused by the decline or demise of an industry) is a known economic concept which is easily tackled through retraining and relocating workers.

I also believe that fox hunting presents a residual risk to public safety. Whilst there will also be risks associated with shooting, all land on which pest control takes place should be approved by specialist police officers beforehand (or the shooter must be very experienced with a proven record), and shooters will always be ensure of their backdrops etc meaning that the risk of incidents is exceptionally low. The nature of pest control shooting is very clinical - each shot must be accountable and careful risk assessment takes place.

There have been numerous incidents, on the other hand, of fox hunts trespassing on people's private property to continue their chases, and charging across roads (and even railways) without due risk assessment. The fast-paced nature of fox hunting combined with the fact that hunt members can hide behind the label of 'the hunt' which is seen to be acting in the 'public good' means that there is little to no accountability for incidents such as trespassing in peoples' gardens and potentially hunting their pets!

Also, I personally think that the presence of a large group of horses and dogs (with no legal requirement for insurance) on a public highway of any sort presents an unacceptable obstruction and risk to other road users (be they motorists, pedestrians or cyclists)

Yes, tradition should be respected, but the fact that the slums had heritage leading back to the Industrial Revolution did not stop them being cleared, and the fact that public hanging for theft was a long standing tradition (and possibly a deterrent against crime) did not stop us abolishing it, and I really don't see that tradition should be the main argument here. A democratically elected government passed the law and served one more term following the ban, and subsequent public pulls have consistently delivered a an anti-hunting response.

Throughout the years the pro fox-hunting lobby have exploited the notion of the 'countryside' as being an entirely seperate entity within the UK, with the notion that tradition should come above all else - indeed many people take it as far as to say that foxhunting or even the countryside itself is a way of life. I find it difficult to see how people can really take this view - it is my firm belief that we are all equal under the law and government of this country, no exceptions. It's not really appropriate to say "if you don't like it, don't do it" because it is clear that many people feel that it is not only "not for them" but that it is also abhorrent to their moral standards (and not just their personal tastes), and therefore they feel not only that they should not take part, but that it should not go on at all. I think that there is a strong argument that fox hunting is not in good taste in 21st Century Britain - if it was the most effective way of controlling foxes then this would redeem it to some extent, however I have serious doubts that it is and therefore I wholeheartedly stand against it!
 
 
 
This is such an utterly ridiculous argument. It is highly amusing that it is all you have to be honest. It is akin to saying that a group of exterminators destroying a wasps nest is exactly the same as an ancient sacrifice.

Here is a tip for you. Drop the emotive analogy and try to debate like a grown up.  

Seeing as you enjoy emotive analogy I will construct one of my own.

I am a serial killer and have just broken into your house and slaughtered your family. You should have made a better house..... Sucks but it is what happens.

Ridiculous as that is, hopefully it will open your eyes to what your posts look like to the rest of us.  

 

That is all I have?
 
Keep trolling kid, keep trolling.

You are comparing a fox killing chickens, a completely natural part of the food chain and completely avoidable situation to a serial killer?
As I said, keep trolling...
 
 
I'm for it and live in the countryside.
 
 
 
No it isn't, you are against animal suffering, battery farms result in suffering.

 

And I'm against battery farms too, as I've said. So it's pretty irrelevent to continue talking about it when we're supposed to be discussing fox hunting!
 
 
 
But why does it matter if its a sport if the end result is the same  

 

Because why you do something is morally more important than what you do.
What if a vet had to put your dog down and said, "Hey, lets give it a head start, I want to practice my long shots."?

But what have your particular set of morals got to do with other people’s actions.

I don’t think its moral for one person to impose there views upon others. Some may pull the 'good for society' argument but the hunt ban isn’t even that, seeing as society at large is generally apathetic about the hunt until someone starts whipping things up.
 
 
 
I wouldn't necessarily agree with this. Rights can be bestowed as and when we please.

 

Those aren't rights, they're permissions.

 
Again I would contend this. I don't see how us being at the top of the food chain necessitates a duty of care. Certainly that is admirable but given the current reality and a large scale demand for food at competitive prices. It isn't really going to happen.

 

...so don't even try?

 
However I completely agree with you on this issue. But that is not my point. My point is that, if one were to take this position, there are far more pressing issues than fox hunting, which, relatively kills a negligible amount of animals and the cruelty that exists as part of it pales in comparison to large scale industry. Hence my calling the other users disingenuous and emotive.

 

let's deal with the other issues as well, one at a time until they're all sorted but don't start giving up ground gained. We don't want to repeal laws against cock and dog fighting, badger baiting, hare coursing or any of the other medieval sadisms that passed for sport at the time.

 
Would you kill a Gorrila for ashtrays if, for instance the money you spent and contributed to the hunting industry in a certain part of Africa stopped the locals from slaughtering these creatures en masse for food with far more ignoble methods?

 

No, I wouldn't. If I was going to contribute to a local economy, it would not in any way be hunting related. BTW gorillas and elephants aren't hunted for food they are poached for the sick trophy industry.

 
Would you enjoy seeing the fox maimed in a trap? Or stuck in a humane trap, dehydrated, starving, terrified until the time when it is blown to pieces?

 

I know a small number of people who shoot and they all say that foxes would be easy to cull in this way. Farmers are practical people with a job to do; if that was how it had to be done, they would quickly become adept.

 
All I am saying is that emotive reverse snobbery has far more to do with peoples opinions on this issue than cruelty to animals. I would highly recommend everyone visit an abbatoir before getting involved in such an irellevent issue as fox hunting. The same goes for many other blood sports.

 

I'm sure that people have different reasons such as inverted snobbery, bunny huggery, belief in a divine spark etc. for opposing this and any other blood sport - my own are tied up in its effect on the people who participate and by extention our society.
 
 
*** I've just joined in now, so sorry if these points have already been discussed ***

To those who say fox culling is necessary, however making a game out of it is not acceptable:

1. What's the difference between fishing and fox hunting? Both are aimed at increasing food, whilst also making a game out of it. On those grounds would you suggest sport fishing should be stopped? It is the worlds most popular sport nonetheless... and yes I know the end result is foxes die, whereas sport fishing that isn't the aim.

I respect chasing a fox with dogs may be inhumane however:

2. What's the difference between a dog killing a fox, than a fox killing a sheep? Surely killing one fox, is better because you may potential be saving say 10 sheep from an inhumane death? Foxes do not kill a sheep, drag it back and live off it for a while - they kill fresh sheep.

I know we may kill some sheep anyway, but I hope it's a much more pleasant way than a fox killing a sheep.

I think the problem that a lot of people have with fox hunting (either conciously or subconciously) is the instrinsically ritualistic and bloodthirsty nature of it. Fishing is a pretty laid back sport (certainly, whenever I've seen people fishing at my local reservoir, they've been sitting under a sun shade on a folding chair with vacuum flasks!) - even with coarse fishing where the end result is that the fish do get killed and eaten, there is no bloodthirst or ceremony attached with the kill.

Fox hunting on the other hand feels almost tribal in comparison - people doing it in uniforms with a rank structure within the hunt - probably most telling is the fact that it is a hunt tradition (might recently have gone out of favour due to being unsanitary, but I imagine it is still practised in some places) to smear the blood of the fox over the faces of young children in attendance!

Farmers do get annoyed when there livestock is attacked, that's why so much emotion is expressed during a hunt. Fox hunting is often a retaliation, whereas fishing is not. Fox culling is needed, the chase is just a byproduct of it.

When fishing, and you make a big catch, you will probably celebrate it.
Bloodthirst is just a loaded term, it makes it seem worse than it actually is, which is the problem. The hunts primarily goal is to kill the animal, not to cause pain to the animal (ironic as it is!), whilst also taking part of a social outing. I find it annoying that people exaggerate the emotions felt within a hunt.

I watched a hunt (sat in a trailer of a tractor   ) probably about 10-15 years ago, when I was maybe only 7. I didn't get any blood smeared over me, and there was only one other young person with me. It's not something I'm aware of that happens now.

On the topic of a rank structure, is this not because it's the best way to approach it? If there was no structure to a hunt, it would be inefficient and the fox would be running for longer.

OFF TOPIC: The last fox I have seen to be killed ran in to a field which was being being mowed, (combine harvester I have no idea what the actually term is!) It was already half way through, so 4 people were stationed on each corner of the field on top of a tractor armed with a shotgun, whilst the field was getting mowed and the fox was still inside, they waited until it made a run for it before killing it.

1. I personally would say it isn't necessary anyway, but also the difference I think is a brutal death.

2. The difference is the dogs wouldn't chase and kill a fox in a very painful manner if people didn't tell it to and create a sport out of it; a fox needs to eat.

I can never understand the argument for 'its not natural'. Why are we any different than a fox, who needs to eat?

At the end of the day, we have influenced nature - we have changed the food chain.

As such, we have influenced on what a dog needs to eat! We have fed them, changed their food chain so they do not need to hunt for food. Previously in the wild, they may at times need to kill foxes, you've just been socialised into thinking that's not the natural thing they do.

No. We're not killing it for food so there's nothing natural about it. The dog doesn't eat it either, it's just killing because it's told to... So there's no excuse to be honest.

I don’t think its moral for one person to impose there views upon others. Some may pull the 'good for society' argument but the hunt ban isn’t even that, seeing as society at large is generally apathetic about the hunt until someone starts whipping things up.

 

I doubt if I could impose my morals (such as they are) on anyone and wouldn't dream of trying. My point is that rather than arguing for the 'rights' of a fox, I am more concerned about the nature of someone who would find killing fun. By all means kill animals when they need to be killed but at least show some recognition that you are ending a life and don't make it a game.

The fishing argument is harder to reconcile. Perhaps it's like comparing alcohol to other drugs. It's use has become so entrenched in our society that it would be almost impossible now to enforce such a ban (as the Americans found out) but that's not a good reason to legalize all other drugs.
 
 
 
No. We're not killing it for food so there's nothing natural about it. The dog doesn't eat it either, it's just killing because it's told to... So there's no excuse to be honest.

 

We are killing them for food - it is eating our food!

Think of it of say, a tiger (humans) kills a buffalo (animals we eat such as sheep), and then a lion (the fox) comes along. The lion and tiger may have a fight to keep the prey for themselves, and one of them may end up dead. By that logic that would not be natural.

You seem to forget humans are animals.

Likewise you can edit in dogs for humans into that scenario.

Lions and tigers don't live in the same places.
Plus, if there is these kinds of situations in the wild, they usually fight but don't kill over it. The winner eats til they're full, then others come in to get leftovers.

Humans are animals, but we have moral consideration and intelligence now. When we can simply make the sheep or chickens more safe, there isn't necessarily a reason to kill the foxes.
Plus, if the "lion and tiger" were to fight and maybe kill, it's because they won't eat that day otherwise. If they've eaten recently they tend to give in quicker... There is no such danger with us.

If the farmer has done everything possible to make all of the animals safe, and he is present when a fox is on the farm, I wouldn't have an issue with him shooting it.
I object to the whole sport because the animal dies needlessly, and in great pain.
 
 
 
I'm pretty sure that if the farmers round here could only get rid of foxes by shooting them, they would soon be very adept at it and do it in a thoroughly business-like manner, and would be quite able to distinguish a breeding vixen from a mangy old dog chicken rustler.

 

Most farmers tend to carry shotguns to rifle which aren't going to give a clean death, and then the farmer has to be guarding his coop all day doesn't he. I'm not a farmer and I don't know quite how the logistics would work, maybe its possible to have a dog guarding the coop. That gives a middleground.
 
 
We kill animals for our own pleasure (it's not necessary) therefore I fail to see (unless you're a vegan) why its wrong to kill foxes for pleasure. Are some animals more deserving of certain rights than others? Do we arbitrarily assign rights e.g. you can kill it but you can't 'rape' it?
 
 
 
Farmers do get annoyed when there livestock is attacked, that's why so much emotion is expressed during a hunt.

 

I accept that farmers would take an attack on their land by foxes personally - I can see where this might come from. I don't see why the other people on the hunt who've never touched a pitchfork in their lives - e.g. the very rich members [I'm not saying all are, but some are] or the young children (often girls!) on hunts should derive so much pleasure from it.
 
 
 
Humans are animals, but we have moral consideration and intelligence now. When we can simply make the sheep or chickens more safe, there isn't necessarily a reason to kill the foxes.

 

How can we simply make the sheep or chicken safe? We can either create a net around the animals in a feild, which potentially destroys habitats in the process. Or we can turn to battery farming, which I feel is worse than fox hunting.

For sheep, this is even harder, in the winter its not too bad because you can put them in a barn, where as in the summer you need to have them in a field.

 
Lions and tigers don't live in the same places.

 

I'm not wild cat animal expert, it does not necessarily only mean to be lion and tigers. I was just using it as an example of where an animal may kill to protect its prey. I'm sure you can think of another scenario where this would be applicable.

On the idea that if they kill an animal, and say the lion wins and he gets 'first dibs', and the tiger gets second. Humans do not eat the sheep after a fox has already started eating it.

 
There is no such danger with us.

 

Likewise with foxes, they can easily go back and eat what they have already killed. However they go and get a fresh sheep or chicken.

A member of my family had around 60 chicken killed by foxes in one day, they often kill for fun like this demonstrates!

I have seen a few hunts, and in all they consisted of farmers and family. They also entirely consist of men, when the woman stay at the farm house cooking food or socialising - and if they did watch, it would be from a distance.

I think the rich people you are referring to our those who go on pheasant shoots, not fox hunting.

The aristocracy go on hunts because it is usually their land, the farmers simply work on it. It is much easier to get permission to ride across someones land if they are with you.
 
 
 
Because why you do something is morally more important than what you do.
What if a vet had to put your dog down and said, "Hey, lets give it a head start, I want to practice my long shots."?

 

Well i would hope that if my dog was so sick it needed to be out down it wouldnt be up for moving anywhere fast, thats just unsporting.

Chickens are not in open fields, you can put barbed-wired fences and make the coops safer.
But as I've said... Puting a gard dog there, or shooting them on site = fine. But the whole sport of giving them a horrible painful death is unecessary.

My point on the lion eating first wasn't about us sharing with foxes, but that animals in the wild usually don't fight to the death over food.

Foxes do not kill for fun, this is a ridiculous claim. They kill because they need food, for both them and their offspring. It is insinct to kill as much as they can if possible.

You are entirely missing my point, so here it is again:
Killing them as humanely as possible (like shooting them on your farm) because they are a threat to your livlihood, I am fine with (as long as all proper measures to secure your animals have been taken). The issue is that they train dogs and go on a hunt for a sport, and the foxes suffer a brutal horrific death uneccessarily.
 
 
 
Fox hunting on the other hand feels almost tribal in comparison - people doing it in uniforms with a rank structure within the hunt - probably most telling is the fact that it is a hunt tradition (might recently have gone out of favour due to being unsanitary, but I imagine it is still practised in some places) to smear the blood of the fox over the faces of young children in attendance !

 

One way to risk giving your own children rabies. It would be most unfortunate to the children but I wouldn't have any sympathy for the adults who aren't aware of zoonoses.
 
 
 
Most farmers tend to carry shotguns to rifle which aren't going to give a clean death, and then the farmer has to be guarding his coop all day doesn't he. I'm not a farmer and I don't know quite how the logistics would work, maybe its possible to have a dog guarding the coop. That gives a middleground.

 

These days we would be talking (hopefully) of a sizable field with a barn which is open a lot of the time so that the chickens can move around freely. We're also talking pretty large scale - it's not just a question of guarding a coop.
Yes, it would involve tracking down the fox i.e. hunting it and shooting it. A properly used shot gun can kill perfectly cleanly and many farmers have rifles too (there are more and more deer being farmed here and these are often culled by rifle).
 
 
 
That is all I have?
 
Keep trolling kid, keep trolling.

You are comparing a fox killing chickens, a completely natural part of the food chain and completely avoidable situation to a serial killer?
As I said, keep trolling...

 

I'll take that as an admission of defeat.  
 
 
 
Those aren't rights, they're permissions.

 

Explain to me the difference.  

 
...so don't even try?
let's deal with the other issues as well, one at a time until they're all sorted but don't start giving up ground gained. We don't want to repeal laws against cock and dog fighting, badger baiting, hare coursing or any of the other medieval sadisms that passed for sport at the time.
 

You are missing the point. My point is not that these things should be allowed, or encouraged. It is that self-rightous campaigns to get rid of them on the basis of animal cruelty are entirely disingenuous and full of hot air. Self-important organisations like Peta et al who go after the most relatively insignificant animal cruelty issues whilst scoffing down beef and chicken. It is just one massive ego boost for them. So is the issue of fox hunting. I'm not judging you, I am laughing at you. I personally have no opinion on this issue. Merely an eye for the hypocritical and absurd.

 
No, I wouldn't. If I was going to contribute to a local economy, it would not in any way be hunting related. BTW gorillas and elephants aren't hunted for food they are poached for the sick trophy industry.
 

You reveal a startling lack of knowledge regarding the hunting industry in Africa. I would suggest reading up on it. The income for local populations from regulated trophy hunting ensures that the animals are worth more to them alive in quanityt than dead and roasting. If it were not for the income from rich western indivdiuals hunting for a weekend. (An average hunt costs about $200,000) then the animals would have more value as food for the locals. Do you see now? Would you still ban trophy hunting which can be used to control a population and fuel a local economy? Or would you rather these animals were hunted on a far greater, indiscriminate scale for food by a poor population? (The world isn't quite as simple as you would like)

 
I know a small number of people who shoot and they all say that foxes would be easy to cull in this way. Farmers are practical people with a job to do; if that was how it had to be done, they would quickly become adept.
 

This is an unsubstantiated opinion. Show me evidence.

 
I'm sure that people have different reasons such as inverted snobbery, bunny huggery, belief in a divine spark etc. for opposing this and any other blood sport - my own are tied up in its effect on the people who participate and by extention our society.
 

Well then my point still stands. You would have a society in which the people weep for a few foxes and yet ignore the millions upon millions of sentient creatures, bred into a cage, fattened up and then slaughtered. As I have said wholly disingenuous. What industry has more damage on our society and the people who participate?
 
 
 
I'll take that as an admission of defeat.  

 

Hardly, I just cannot see the logic in debating with someone who is hell bent on warping what I say to suit themselves. That's not an argument - it's an exercise in futility.

You're obviously just here for the argument and (in your own head) winning points rather than any meaningful exchange of views. I have at no point "wept for foxes" or argued for animal rights( i.e. generally accepted minimum expectations rather than largesse bestowed by a more powerful authority). My only point all along, and I will make it again, is that it saddens me that in the C21st we still have so many people in our society who enjoy inflicting suffering (rather like your approach to debate) and I find it repugnant that anyone would find fun in killing something. It is what it has always been: the bullying of the vulnerable by the inadequate who find themselves in a position of power.

The inadequate? Again would you care to substantiate this? Your argument is full of emotive generalisation and fails to adress the complexity of this issue. You have just dodged all of my points on Africa and the ethics of the thing and the blind eye turned to the mass death camps we breed and slaughter tens of millions of animals in each year. You talk about being sad so many enjoy inflicting suffering when it is not necessary. Then where is your attack on the livestock industry!? Isn't that inflciting death and pain for unecessary enjoyment? Why did you even quote me in the first place if you were not prepared/capable to engage in intellectual discussion? (That is what this forum is for   )

Neither have you addressed my one and only point and the only point that I will continue to make - it's not about foxes, it's about people.
 

Yes, I have acknowledged that more than once. My point, is that this position is entirely disingenuous given the wider complexities of industry involving the slaughter, rearing and extermination of animals. How you can say that hunting and bloodsport has more of a negative effect on society than the industrial death camps we use to breed, rear and slaughter our food. I suppose you are more of the opinion that out of sight out of mind.

Yet I would contend that such ignorance is far more damaging to our society than an exceptionally small amount of animals being killed for sport. So I say again... Your position is disingenuous.

Now, I am fully expecting you to lazily dismiss my points with unsubstantiated ad hom despite the fact I ahve addressed you points.

I don't, and haven't said that. Don't suppose my opinions. My position is far from disingenuous; it applies equally to the off-topic issues you are raising. There is a spectrum between "We are the top species so we can do what we like to everything else" and "Don't kill that scorpion, it has a right to live" (said to me by an American tourist in Egypt when I prevented said scorpion from stinging my daughter). Where each of us places oneself on that spectrum is a moral decision. Societies put some of these decisions into law as they decide what is best for the majority of the people in that society (or the ruling family) and of course this varies from society to society.

On the issue of hunting as fun, my opinion (and it is only my opinion - I'm no evangelist) is that this barbarizes the people who take part. Surely this must impact on our society as a whole. How far is that mind set from that of the people who go out in our market towns on a Saturday night literally looking for someone to start a fight with because it's fun (for them)?

 
Yet I would contend that such ignorance is far more damaging to our society than an exceptionally small amount of animals being killed for sport. So I say again... Your position is disingenuous.
