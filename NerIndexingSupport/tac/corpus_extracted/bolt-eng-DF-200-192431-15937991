GURL *high fives*
 
 
 
whyyyyyyyyyyyyy

 

Because it doesn't actually make sense. Not really trying to be a grammar nazi, but 'worlds most beautiful man in the world' is quite bad...
 
 
Matt Berninger. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SAY, he is definitely the world's most beautiful man currently in this worldly world.
 
 
Bradley James.
 
 
I genuinely think Armie Hammer is the closest thing to being perfect in the form of a man...
 
 
 
Bradley James.

 

oh yeah and the guy who plays merlin

bradley is now in lewis new show in itv its a bit rubbish though
 
 
 
whyyyyyyyyy

Marlon Teixeira by a country mile.

Colin Morgan! Uh, he's incredibly beautiful. Unf.

And yeah, Lewis is indeed rubbish but I absolutely adore him as King Arthur. The role suits him perfectly...
 
 
 
what just googled him and i thought  

 

I hope that's a good   rather than a bad one. I still think he's absolutely facially divine.
 
 
That Pip is not that handsome to me... lips = meh.
And what is with the Pattinson love?

I'll try to think of some nice ones... later. Got some TV to watch now  
 
 
Has to be Jared Leto!

I hear its a dude who goes by the name of Woffles  
 
 
 
The title of this thread is bothering me :L

 

Maybe he works for the Departmant of Redundancy Department?
 
 
Alexander Skarsgard is the epitome of man beauty.
 
 
Do chicks with dicks count?  
 
 
David Tennant, without a doubt!
 
 
I see all your submissions and I raise you Marlon Brando.

In terms of living men I have a massive thing for Tom Hardy.
 
 
Subjective opinions will inevitably mean there is no consensus on who is the 'most beautiful man', so the title itself is redundant. That being said, lets just all accept that I am the closest thing and we can move on with our lives.  
 
 
Why has no one mentioned Enrique Iglesias?  
 
 
I give you:

Well he's definitely pretty... lol I think I prefer a guy who doesn't pout quite so much though and maybe who looks like he'd spend less time in the bathroom than me... Do you not think he looks kinda girly?

I like guys who look a bit androgynous   He has a strong jawline though, so he's not too girly for my tastes  
 
 
 
I would have a breakdown if I was in his presence, what a great specimen of a man!

 

And to make matters worse, he is unbelievably talented too. Ugh, I wish he had some obvious flaw   It might make me feel better about not having him to myself.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Douglas Booth people, Douglas Booth

Josh Hartnett has to be one of them, he's gone off the radar recently.. but he's still gorgous.

Bruno Mars is another one for me, its not so much his looks, but his voice and songs are amazing so thats a major factor.

Also, Lil Wayne is very nice too, love the tattoo's

So yeh, abit of a mixed bag for you there, but i cant decided      
 
 
 
 
 

 

Marlon Brando..uuuummmmm if only i was around in the 50's. I loved him as Stanley in A Street car Named Desire
 
 
 
And to make matters worse, he is unbelievably talented too. Ugh, I wish he had some obvious flaw   It might make me feel better about not having him to myself.

 

And he sings so well and his voice is beautiful too

Is it just me that thinks his face looks just like Nick Holzherr's off the Apprentice?
 
 
Cilla Black is the most beautiful man in the world.
 
 
Not exactly my area but I have to admit, young Marlon Brando - pretty homo for that.
 
 
 
I rest my case.
