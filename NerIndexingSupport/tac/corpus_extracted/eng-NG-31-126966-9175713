This team has the same magic — what else can you call it when it comes
back from a 3-1 deficit and utterly humbles Cleveland, the team that
went through the Yankees like a cutting torch through one-ply toilet paper?

I've seen better.   I was living in Kansas City in 1985 when the
Royals
came back from being down 3-1 against Toronto for the AL title and
then
doing the same comeback from 3-1 down to St. Louis in the Series.

The best part was the total paste job they did to St. Louis in Game 7,
11-0
where John Tudor broke some fingers punching something in the dugout
after
being yanked in the 3rd after giving 5 runs.   All told, St. Louis ran
through 7 pitchers, 4 in the 5th inning alone.

The BEST part?  Whitey Herzog losing the series to KC, a team he gave
up the managing job on to take the St. Lou job.
