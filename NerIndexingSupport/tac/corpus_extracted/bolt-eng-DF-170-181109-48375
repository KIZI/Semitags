If it passes the House, Governor O'Malley promises to sign law. Law has provision that no religious institution can be forced to perform the marriages. Prediction: The sky will not fall and it will not effect my marriage one bit.

Thanks for the information. I'll cross Maryland off my list of places to potentially move to, work in, or visit.

No, but that does not mean I have like, accept, or condone your lifestyle. Nor do I have to do business with anyone or any place that does.
 
 
I predicting two possible outcomes. The first, water turning to blood killing all fish and other water life, frogs, lice, gnats and flies, diseased livestock, unhealable boils, hail and thunder, locusts, darkness, and the death of the first-born of all the people of maryland. The second, gays can marry and not in any material way change the life of heterosexuals and christians.
 
 
Get government out of the marriage business.. have government recognize family couples for the purposes of taxation, inheritance, legal and medical decisions in case of emergency, etc.... treate everyone equally....

Government intervention in such things as gay or abnormal marriage forces acceptance... acceptance is a personal thing.... when left in the hands of the churches or whatever other private institutions, people can join as they choose, accept what they believe in, and live free without governmental repercussion... if someone chooses to be with a person of the same or opposite sex is entirely up to them in a free society, but in that free society they are not entitled to make everyone accept their same belief

No one is asking you to accept their belief. The law specifically states that no religious institution can be forced to participate. This about civil rights and fairness before the law.

No... when government mandates acceptance of a choice thru legalities, it is indeed wrong... this law will tie in to discrimination laws, insurance laws, housing law, etc....

By definition, governmental intervention into this forces acceptance on a legal level

This is NOT about fairness (which is inherently SUBJECTIVE, not something government should be)... don't be deluded

My only concern is that sooner or later, someone is going to attempt to sue a religous organization for discrimination because they refused to marry them. At that point the law as written is pretty much moot, as it then becomes a fight between The 1st amendment right to practice ones religion, vs. Equal protection under the law based upon the 14th amendment.

All you need is a single court decsion going against a church that wouldn't marry a gay couple, and you will have a shitstorm to end all shitstorms.

You dun get to discriminate or violate the rights of anyone whom you disapprove of, either. For example, I loathe sexual bigots but I cannot refuse to serve one in my public restaurant or book one into my hotel.

I'm not even allowed to hit one! Sometimes, I think this freedom thingie is a pain in the ass.

"Acceptance" is not personal when the mode in which it is displayed is public. You have no right to refuse to sell a home to, or refuse to hire, etc., another person merely because of the gender of their spouse.

However, if you'd like to stand with the WBC at their next protest, feel free.

Race is known to be determined from human genetic makeup... there is no such thing with being gay or the choice to marry someone of the same sex.... and we are allowed to have preferences of choice and discriminate in relation to choice... This is legislating the acceptance of a choice, something I am not for

No... you should not be allowed to discriminate based on race or other natural/genetic aspects of being a human.... discrimination against the choices of a person is completely acceptable... you don't wish to hire a satanist or you don't wish to have a roommate with a criminal record or whatever, all well and good with me...

And if you think I am a person who does not accept people's choice of sexual lifestyle inherently, you are sadly mistaken.... and if you think I am a person apt to side with Westboro loonies, you are even more mistaken... asshole
 
 
 
Because you only want to live, work or visit among GLBT single people? I can see that, sorta. Marriage does make most people a tad more settled...some would even say boring.
 
Actually, if these people could keep their PRIVATE lives PRIVATE, I'd have a lot less trouble with it, Madeline. I have no need, interest, or desire to see two people of any gender combination exchanging spit or anything like that in a public place. I definitely have no need to see two people of the same gender doing it. The legalization of Gay Marriage is one of many reasons I'm trying to get out of Massachusetts as quickly as I can.

 
You dun get to discriminate or violate the rights of anyone whom you disapprove of, either. For example, I loathe sexual bigots but I cannot refuse to serve one in my public restaurant or book one into my hotel.
 
See, you have made the mistake of involving yourself in a function where your actions can be controlled by the government. I don't own a business. I don't own rental property. I can still choose to associate with only those people whose lifestyle I agree with. So, yes, on a personal level I DO get to discriminate.

 
I'm not even allowed to hit one! Sometimes, I think this freedom thingie is a pain in the ass.
 
If you ever run into me, please feel free to throw a punch. I'll even agree not to sue you or press assault charges. Just realize that I have no problem defending myself with and and/or force I feel necessary from any assault by man or woman.

 
And (and I mean this sincerely), we thank you for that.
 
I'm not sure why you would thank me for suggesting that your lifestyle should be restricted to the shadows of society and your own bedrooms, without any form of legal or societal recognition, as it has been for centuries.

No... fairness is SUBJECTIVE... hence why it has no place in government... now equal treatment under government and under law, all well and good... YOU are the one trying to force acceptance beyond what government should be doing for base equal treatment...

I am all for equal treatment of family units for taxation, inheritance and other governmental realms.... not for forcing someone to recognize a marriage they don't believe in, or force acceptance of a choice of sexual lifestyle....

but nice try

Most of the fights that happened over inter-racial marriage occured way before our current litigation-happy time period. As for inter-faith the usual requirement is to bring the children up as part of one religon to have the ceremony done it that tradition. No faith couples are not going to try to get a faith based marriage anyway.

Are you trying to tell me that somewhere, there will never be a religous gay couple that, when told thier church will not perform a gay marriage, will not sue them on grounds of discrimination?

This is a distinct possibility, and if it does happen, and the couple happens to win, it will be a giant clusterfuck as every person who railed against gay marriage would have a giant "WE TOLD YOU SO!!!" point.

But only in a gay poolroom and a gay restaurant!
 
 
BTW, I cannot be driven out of my home merely because two neighbors have a wedding I disapprove of, or two kids kiss where I can see them. Driving me from my home takes more serious events, like an infestation of rats -- or bigots.

Interracial marriage, Inter-faith marriage, Marriage where one (or both) members were divorced for conditions not recognized by that Church, and/or since Same-sex Civil Marriage is legal in multiple states, Same-sex marriage?

Thank you in advance for providing such supporting evidence.

Seems like using your logic the stricking of laws against interracial marriages should not have happened because there was a possibility that a Church could be sued for not marrying an interracial couple. (BTW - any one can sue anyone else for anything they want. Winning the case is a different matter.)

Yeah. of course. By maintaining the status quo we are forcing our personal choice on people. The fact that the statute empowers the state government to regulate and redefine more relationships that they cannot currently enforce means that the opponents of the bill are trying to enforce personal choices on others.

It's amazing how you can twist reality so easily. You empower the government to enforce your viewpoints and not its the other guys who are the bad guys. You are just trying to "free" people with the use of violence.

It's interesting to note that in the linked article (by The Christian Post) it cites a poll showing 54-37% the people of Maryland oppose Same-sex Civil Marriage. A little research shows that the cited poll was conducted for the National Organization of Marriage, a national action group that specifically opposes equal treatment for homosexuals under the law.

Independent polls show 46-44% (May, 2010  LINK  ) and 51-44% (Jan 2011,  LINK  ) favor Same-sex Civil Marriage.

If it goes to a referendum in 2012, it will be an interesting fight to watch because it has the very real potential to be the first victory at the voting both for same-sex couples in terms of Civil Marriage.

I would like to think that we have learned something from California and Prop H8 and the minority neighborhoods and voters will NOT be taken for granted this time.
 
 
 
BTW, I cannot be driven out of my home merely because two neighbors have a wedding I disapprove of, or two kids kiss where I can see them. Driving me from my home takes more serious events, like an infestation of rats -- or bigots.
 
In my case all it takes is an infestation of disgusting, immoral Liberals. I had hoped that Central/Western Massachusetts might be able to survive what goes on East of Rt. 128. I was wrong. Very wrong. Wrong enough that I'm looking at a total life change to get the hell out of here ASAP.

The first states to allow Same-sex Civil Marriage did so because of court order.

At least two that I can think of now have it based on legislative action (IIRC Vermont and New Hampshire) not court mandate.

If Same-sex Civil Marriage is approved by the voters in a Maryland referendum that would be huge, repeat HUGE, in terms of long term political capital against the social authoritarian talking point that Same-sex Civil Marriage has never won at the voting both.

If the referendum fails with the voters, I predict it would be a tipping point for voters in other states to know, "Hey, it's OK to vote to end discrimination."

Please scroll up to my response to a similar point made by someone else.

In the other cases it is either that the religion itself has not issue with the marriage in question, or there are other factors involved. In the case of gay marriage, you can have people who beleive in the tenets of the religon, except for the things against gay relations, who feel discriminated against due to the religon denying them a marriage under thier tradition. In today's litigous environment, I do not see this never happening.

I'm a Conservative. I'm surprised they allowed me into the Communistwealth of Taxachusetts to begin with, 13 years ago.

I'm looking at PA right now. Texas would be great but I'm not sure I have the finances to make that big of a move right now. Utah is a religious theocracy; that's not what I'm lookin for. If it weren't for the chaos in the Middle East and their lack of RTKBA legislation I would have been there a long time ago.
 
 
 
 
 
My only concern is that sooner or later, someone is going to attempt to sue a religous organization for discrimination because they refused to marry them. At that point the law as written is pretty much moot, as it then becomes a fight between The 1st amendment right to practice ones religion, vs. Equal protection under the law based upon the 14th amendment.

All you need is a single court decsion going against a church that wouldn't marry a gay couple, and you will have a shitstorm to end all shitstorms.
 

Could you cite for us any successful lawsuit against a Church for failure to perform a wedding that is against the doctrines of that Church for...
Interracial marriage, Inter-faith marriage, Marriage where one (or both) members were divorced for conditions not recognized by that Church, and/or since Same-sex Civil Marriage is legal in multiple states, Same-sex marriage?

Thank you in advance for providing such supporting evidence.

Seems like using your logic the stricking of laws against interracial marriages should not have happened because there was a possibility that a Church could be sued for not marrying an interracial couple. (BTW - any one can sue anyone else for anything they want. Winning the case is a different matter.)

Please scroll up to my response to a similar point made by someone else.

In the other cases it is either that the religion itself has not issue with the marriage in question, or there are other factors involved. In the case of gay marriage, you can have people who beleive in the tenets of the religon, except for the things against gay relations, who feel discriminated against due to the religon denying them a marriage under thier tradition. In today's litigous environment, I do not see this never happening.
 
Because you've been told it is something to be afraid of....but you haven't been told that there have been NO successful lawsuits against any church for refusing to marry couples they. don't. want. to.

In neither post have you provided any supporting legal evidence that there has ever been a successful lawsuit against a Church for failing to perform a wedding, you raise the specter of "Well what if...". Well "What if..." it was possible that a Church might be sued for not performing an interracial marriage, that is not justification for continued discrimination in the law. Well "What if..." it was possible that a Church might be sued for not performing an inter-faith marriage, that is not justification for continued discrimination in the law.

People, more and more, are seeing that we are NOT the Boogie Man.
 
No, but that does not mean I have like, accept, or condone your lifestyle. Nor do I have to do business with anyone or any place that does.
 
You dun get to discriminate or violate the rights of anyone whom you disapprove of, either. For example, I loathe sexual bigots but I cannot refuse to serve one in my public restaurant or book one into my hotel.

I'm not even allowed to hit one! Sometimes, I think this freedom thingie is a pain in the ass.
 
Very telling that you want to hit people who exhibit behavior with which you disagree.
 
 
 
 
 
BTW, I cannot be driven out of my home merely because two neighbors have a wedding I disapprove of, or two kids kiss where I can see them. Driving me from my home takes more serious events, like an infestation of rats -- or bigots.
 
In my case all it takes is an infestation of disgusting, immoral Liberals. I had hoped that Central/Western Massachusetts might be able to survive what goes on East of Rt. 128. I was wrong. Very wrong. Wrong enough that I'm looking at a total life change to get the hell out of here ASAP.
 
I understand that Massachusetts will be grateful to you when you leave. May I suggest an appropriate state like Texas or Mississippi or Utah? Or perhaps another country like Iran? Their lose will be Massachusett's gain.

In no place in my post(s) did I ever imply that I am against this happening in Maryland. I have always said that there is no consitutional ban against gay marriage (I also think there is no constitutional right to one either), and that is has always been a legislative function of the state. If allowed to vote in a refurendum, however, I would oppose it being allowed, as to me it is not marriage, but would not throw a fit if a vote for it passed and it became law, nor would I attend rallies against it, or protest against it.

My concerns are actually something supporters should worry about far more than people who are against it. IF one of these lawsuits were to ever happen, and IF even one of them managed to succeed in any level of the judicial system, the backlash would be catastrophic on a national level, not just a state level. Such a lawsuit would play into all the fears and catastrophic predictions your opponents have been using for years.

I've still yet to hear how homosexuals getting married has ANY impact on any other couple or family. I love the hypocrisy of people who want to be able to make their own choices without outside interference, but it's not ok for others to be treated the same way.

So if you believe that Civil Marriage is a legislative function of the State, then do you support the repeal of the Federal DOMA and returning to the federal government recognizing all legal marriages entered into under State law.

[BTW - I just so you know, I support the replacement of DOMA because I feel it is defective in that is was obviously an discriminatory law target one group. DOMA **ONLY** exempts states for recognizing only one type of Civil Marriage. DOMA should be repealed and the federal government should recognize all legal Civil Marriages and Congress should provide (under it's Article IV Section 1 authority) that no state is required to recognize **ANY** Civil Marriage that conflicts with it's own laws. That returns the power to the States to decide on Civil Marriage.]

It doesn't have an effect on any other couple, but it does on all families with kids. Both traditional and homosexual.

When young children daydream and think about adulthood, getting married like their parents today means man and woman. Throw gay into the equation and they are then thrown into the sexuality of family and not simply the unity and love of family.

A kid can want to live with a partner like his uncle, get married like his dad, live with a partner like his dad etc. At a young and impressionable age when they simply want to emulate someone they love keeping things separate but equal also keep young minds free to mature and discover at their own pace.

I don't mean this as saving the children from homosexuality, but saving them from the discovery and discussion of sex at all until they are ready.
 
 
 
If it passes the House, Governor O'Malley promises to sign law. Law has provision that no religious institution can be forced to perform the marriages. Prediction: The sky will not fall and it will not effect my marriage one bit.
 
100% agree with your prediction and say it is about time that this happened.

As far as the kid who wants to "get married like his dad" can do so even if his dad is married to another guy. Marriage is about love, not gender. The discovery and discussion of sex should happen when it is time, having 2 parents of the same gender won't make it happen anymore because if everyone realized it is not a big deal it would be seen as normal and no one would question it.
 
 
 
Well, I was right. Iran is the country for you.
 
Nah. I'm more a believer in morality than in religion. Someplace like Saudi Arabia would work if it weren't for the RTKBA issue.

Quite possibly one of the dumbest posts I've seen on this site in a long time. Believe me, that's no easy feat on this site. Bravo!  

So, let me get this straight
- Kids want to one day marry, but if Gays can marry then the idea that marriage is about Love is lost? So gays don't marry because of love?

- So allowing gay people to marry might turn more kids gay?

Wouldn't "keeping young minds free" actually be reason to support gay marriage and show them that they should accept who they are because it's ok to be proud of your feelings and who you love?
 
 
 
 
Well, I was right. Iran is the country for you.
 
Nah. I'm more a believer in morality than in religion. Someplace like Saudi Arabia would work if it weren't for the RTKBA issue.

Why would Greece be a more appropriate country for me? Please explain, because I am quite happy living in a country that is showing more and more that we are all indeed equal under the law...as it should be.

So no, there has not always been (nor is there currently) only one type of marriage.

We are discussing US law here, and prior to the same sex marriage debate legal marriage was between a man and a woman, one of each, only 1 pair at the same time. Polygamy was only recognized for a brief time in Utah.

The restrictions of race on marriage are very very different than the current sex based restrictions, as race based restrictions in public law have been established as unconstitutional originally in the 1870's (which were erroneously overturned) and rightly re-recognized as unconstitutional during the 1950's and 1960's. With the exception to voting rights, restrictions in public law based on gender are still being upheld.

Perhaps he realized how ridiculous his comment was?

Nah.................  
 
 
Once more and more states allow gay marriage it will pressure those states that do not to accept people who were married in other states.

There are too many legal ramifications of nullifying a marriage because you crossed state lines

Good grief you are irritating and yes, ridiculous.

Go back and read what I posted -your preconceived notions aside, then ask about what is not clear to you if you really want to discuss what was a polite response to your question.

There is no reason for me to defend your idiotic mis-interpretation of my post.

No we weren't discussing just US law. You said "Also, before all the gay marriage stuff started there WAS only one kind of marriage, one man, one woman. thats it. It was regular marriage legal, anything else illegal."

You said before the discussion of same-sex civil marriage there was only one kind of marriage. You placed no restrictions on just US law. So you were in fact incorrect.

 
The restrictions of race on marriage are very very different than the current sex based restrictions, as race based restrictions in public law have been established as unconstitutional originally in the 1870's (which were erroneously overturned) and rightly re-recognized as unconstitutional during the 1950's and 1960's. With the exception to voting rights, restrictions in public law based on gender are still being upheld.
 

The race based restrictions creating white marriage and minority marriage were found to be limitations on freedoms one individuals rights. Slowly we are seeing that limitations on marriage based on gender are also limitations on freedoms and individual rights. Opinions are changing. Slowly true, but they are changing. In the early 20 years ago opinions on Same-sex Civil Marriage were strongly opposed (resulting in the Federal DOMA). In that time we have gone from "0" states recognizing Same-sex Civil Marriage in some fashion to 9 states and the District of Columbia.

In addition, in 2000 and 2004 voter initiatives amended statutory law and state constitutions and won by (IIRC) a range of 23-76%. The last two referendums (California and Maine) have narrowed the margin so that a change of 2-3% by voters would have had Same-sex Civil Marriage.

Just as segregating marriage by race eventually toppled, history and current trends show that segregating Civil Marriage by gender will also eventually topple.

As I said before, if the legislature and governor pass Same-sex Civil Marriage and those who wish to continue discrimination take it to the voting both in a referendum it will be an interesting situation to watch. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not calling the vote either way, but mark my words it will be damned close.

Be careful thinking history is a constant march toward more liberal social policy, conservative retreats can and have occurerd, some having lasted centuries. The Roman empire was pretty swinging, and then all of a sudden this prudish chirstianity stuff took hold.

I also find people using the word discrimination too cavilerly. In this case even if we grant same sex couples the right to marry, arent we then discriminating against polygamists?

Actually the position supporting Same-sex Civil Marriage is quite conservative has it supports more individual freedoms, liberty, and less intrusive government. The social authoritarians wanting big government to dictate how other people live their lives is actually a pretty liberal perspective.

From Merriam-Webster: Discrimination - "the act, practice, or an instance of discriminating categorically rather than individually "

When a select group is targeted for unequal treatment because they are a member of that group, then that is discrimination.

I can't speak for others, I don't use discrimination "cavilerly", I use it correctly. Discrimination is not a bad word. You don't have to run away from it. The question is, does discrimination occur - yes, of course it dose. The correct questions from a social and legal perspective is "is there a compelling reason to support the government discriminating against it's citizens in the case of XXXXX?". For example it is perfectly reasonable to discriminate against blind people and deny them a drivers license as someone who can't see should not be operating a multi-ton vehicle at 60 MPH on the public highways endangering themselves and other members of the public. (Now if the person wants to drive a truck on their private property I have no issue with that.) However to date no one has provided a valid (IMHO) compelling government reason for denying like situated couples equal treatment under the law. Those like situated couples of course being law abiding, United States Citizen, tax paying, consenting, infertile, adult different sex couples and law abiding, United States Citizen, tax paying, consenting, infertile, adult same sex couples.

How would that be? Since we don't allow polygamy in traditional marriages, this doesn't change a pre-existing condition.
