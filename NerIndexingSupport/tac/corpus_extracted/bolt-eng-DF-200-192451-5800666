 
 
Which countries will cease to exist?
 
 
If you look at a map of the Middle East or Europe in 1900 it doesn't look anything like it does in 2010 (obviously), but I was thinking are the countries we have established now more secure and stable than the countries in 1900s?

For the purposes of this discussion, countries are members of the United Nations and "secure and stable" is purely in the sense of the strength of the existence of a state.

Which countries do you think are likely to cease to exist in 100 years? Which countries would you want to cease to exist?

In this I include radical regime change: not just the shifting of political programmes (e.g. from a nationalised health service to no state intervention in healthcare) but a radical shift in political structure (for example, the abolition of the Islamic Republic of Iran - but not necessarily a sovereign body over Iran).

What do you think? Discuss (or just ignore).
 
 
Greece and UAE (10 years later when earth's oil finish).

I want Israel to cease to exist because they did so many bad things such as conflict with Palestine.
 
 
Israel will hopefully be gone in 100 years, being an illegal/terrorist state and all that.
 
 
Israel,as a Jewish state.I read an article by some guy who is convinced of a one-state solution of a secular state of Israeli/Palestine will happen within decades.Not my opinion but is a possibility I suppose if there was a radical change in policy over the next century,could have a chance of happening.....ish.

European states as sovereign states.Instead entering a federal,supranational European Union.
 
 
Pakistan, it'll be reunited with India.... LOL.... Could happen?????
 
 
I would like to see the complete destruction of the Islamic Republic Regime of Iran, and the emergence of a democratic secular Iranian Republic. I think this will happen sooner or later.

On the whole in the Middle East I would like secularisation. I think as the populace become more educated and prosperous, this could happen, especially if the Islamic Republic Regime of Iran collapses, since they are the main financers and proponents of theocratic, undemocratic political systems.

I get the feeling that one day there will be an independent Kurdistan. I also think a two state solution re Israel-Palestine may one day be reached.

I don't think the Basque seperatists will ever be successful.

I think Korean re-unification may eventually be reached, especially after the death of the Dear Leader

You just wait. In a 100 years they'll name a country after me...

Oh, wait. They already have.

Isn't Andorra basically a village and a ski slope? People will probably just forget it's there.
 
 
Unfortunately, I think the U.K will cease to exist in 100 years time. Nationalism within each constituent is going too far

Agreed, and this should be done through exclusively peaceful means where possible. Violence should be an absolute last resort on the part of the West. Reforming those societies is primarily the task of the peoples of those countries, and we should peacefully support them in throwing off tyranny and oppression.

I'd like to see this too, though this seems increasingly unlikely as time goes on due to the settlement program making a contiguous, viable Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital increasingly unrealistic. Unless something it done soon (serious negotiations participated in seriously by both Israel and Palestine, palestinian statehood, a serious settlement freeze or something) it seems that either the conflict will go on, or there will be some sort of one-state solution. The situation doesn't look too good there at the moment. (at least this is what I have gleaned from various places - I'm sure Folderol is going to correct me though   )

That would be the weirdest thing ever. Millions of people essentially having to be un-brainwashed. I would not want to be the people dealing with the cluster-****. Who knows wtf would happen if the Dear Leader (or his successor) lost his grip on the country.

Throwing it out there to those who know more about it than I - how about a separate Pashtunistan or Kashmir?

I'm not convinced they will stop hostilities within decades, let alone form a secular state together. Neither side has much commitment to make peace with the other and it doesn't look like they will any time soon.

The only way I see anything changing is a UN force seizing control and forcing them to either live side-by-side or together - something I doubt could ever happen.
 
 
Hopefully the little Nazi state on the Med.
 
 
A 100 years from now all the oil will be gone with the money that came with it so, i think the middle east will brake up into small countries not much more advanced than Afghanistan is todey.

Why should they be forced to have democracy or secularity? What about if they like there existing government? The Iranian people have overthrown their government once before, but the Arabs, no. The Arab citizens are getting a very standard of living and benefits from their current leader; do you think they would risk that? Anyway, any talks about secularity and democracy will come AFTER their oil runs out.

you obviously know nothing about the majority of states in the Middle East region.
 
 
I cannot see many of the Arabian countries lasting in the long term, their main trade is limited. I think North Korea will be bombed at one point as will Iran.

Besides oil... what trade does Saudi Arabia have ?
 
 
Yea yeah, say what you want. Israel will always exist, no matter what you want. I think Iran will be attacked by some states and that it will loose that war. A war it started by itself.

Just look at their wikipedia page. Click on the economy. Calculate how much oil counts for their GDP.

Yes but there are many other countries where oil is not their export in the Middle East!!
 
 
I can't really predict the future but...

Here's hoping Pakistan gets absorbed back into India, they can still call the area Pakistan if they wish etc but it would bring more peace to that particular area I believe (I also can't hide the fact that I'm Indian though, so a v. small bias :P). However this is just not going to happen.

Israel should go. Or at least stop being such terrorists.

Hopefully we get the balls to deal with N. Korea - or even better, N. Korea starts a conventional arms war with the South and then we have a reason to attack the North.
 
 
at least in africa countries could either lose their soverienty based on neighbours invading for any neccsary resources. or degenerate into a state similar to somalia without a government or a sense of national unity. then again some countries may emerge if they are able to seal independence from another nation.
 
 
If this is turning into a "which country would you like to see wiped off the map" thread, then I'm very much hoping for Saudi Arabia.
 
 
lol, Britains way to proud to die, although we may be have a mild tinge of the ol inbreeding depression  
 
 
Lot of (Muslim) people on this thread calling for the destruction of Israel.....  

As the only secular democracy in the middle east and the only place where trade unionists, women, homosexuals etc would live without persecution, I want Israel to stay there. If only the rest of the middle east could follow suit, the world might be a more civilized, less crazy place.
If Israel was destroyed, the country would revert back to the dusty ****-hole full of hateful arabs that it once was, just like the countries around it.

I would like some major change to Saudi Arabia and for their monarchy to stop sponsoring the spread of Islamist extremism around the world whilst at the same time claiming to be our "ally" in the war on terror - yeah right.

And the changes in Iran as detailed by Democracy.

You want Israel to stay because trade unionists, women and homosexuals are allowed to live there without persecution, great. What about the Palestinians that are mercilessly oppressed and systematically waged war upon in order for them to be eradicated.

Oh I think you missed that point  
 
 
Probably Israel, the Arab States, Taiwan and EU States.

I don't think that's the case, however that's what Arabic leaders and media constantly tell Arabs to make them feel under attack and hostile to Israel, and to encourage their children to want to become suicide bombers.
Since Israel is surrounded by hostile neighbors who are determined to eradicate not just Israel but the Jews as a whole, and Palestinians elected a terrorist group to represent them for whom Jihad and not dialogue is the only option, I think they reap what they so.

"mercilessly oppressed systematically waged war upon in order for them to be eradicated."

Get real. This double-think and inversion of the truth is dangerous, and I hope people don't swallow it.

It's Israel's neighbors who have waged war on Israel ever since it's inception in order to eradicate the Jews, not the other way round. It's the Arabs that want to eradicate the Jews, not the other way around.
It's not the Israeli's who are full of hate and want to drive the Palestinians into the sea, it's the Palestinians and Arabs that want to drive the Jews in to the sea, and claim that "The Jews are in one place [Israel] for easy killing come judgment day."
If Israel was weak for a minute it would be destroyed, just as many even on this forum want it to be.

But we're going off topic now and I don't really want this to turn into another Israel/Palestine thread. PM me if you want to continue this convo.

Then maybe the Palestinians should stop being terrorists so Israel doesn't have to defend itself. Blame effect on cause, not on effect. Like me slapping a kid around the face and then prosecuting the kid for crying.
 
 
Most of the african states I believe, since most of them shouldn't exist with their current boundaries. A sad consequence of european imperialism. Koreas would unite sometime in the future and Europe will turn into a federal superstate to challenge the United States...come on someone should do, and that way the United Kingdoms "special relationship" with the US is not possible.
 
 
North Korea is likely to collapse within the next 25 years, and I expect once that happens we'll have an East German style unification (i.e. absorption of the poorer half by the richer) into one 'Korea'.

Taiwan will, I think, rejoin mainland China in 50 years. It may not be through coercion. The Taiwanese are becoming less hostile towards the PRC, and particularly if the PRC undergoes political reform they may see joining China as an attractive proposition. (China would guarantee them some degree of autonomy and whatnot as well, I imagine).

Further down the line, the obvious tinder box is the Middle East. I have no idea what states would cease to exist, but in theory some of the secular republics could be overthrown by religious fanatics, and vice versa.
 
 
How about the UK - will it split up into Scotland, England, Wales? N. Ireland might go with rep of Ireland if the demographics continue to change the way they do now.
 
 
Hopefully Palestine will just become Israel.
 
 
Nobody has mentioned the Maldives, which stand a good chance of completely disappearing of the face of the earth.

Who is this 'arab media' you speak of? This is the kind of blind ignorance which exists in the USA were most people think of the conflict in terms of 300 million Arabs vs 6 million Jews. Saudi Arabia, Egpyt and a few other Sunni powers, as well as Iraq were quietly cheering Israel on against both Hamas and Hezbollah. They are happy with the current US backed regionall system and most definately do not want the kind of Middle East the Islamic Republic of Iran, Syria and their Hamas/Hezbol proxies envisage. You need to get over this misconception.

I explicitly said using peaceful means. That explicitly means NOT forocing them to have democracy or secularism. That means supporting democratic, and secular elements in those countries if they do try to shake off the yoke of their corrupt leaders. It means allowing them to choose their own form of government.

And sorry, but you have no ******* clue what the Arabs would want if they were not oppressed any more. I'd like to see them given the chance to choose - at the moment, they do not.

to answer OP's question... definitely Israel (the brand new country that everyone's gonna love) and South Korea and North Korea will become Korea, similarly to North Dakota and South Dakota will become Dakota  
 
 
Nigeria - if Gadaffi had his way  

The Maldives are sadly going to disappear soon too

Israel is not going anywhere but hopefully the Palestinians will finally have a state.
 
 
I used to think that Afghanistan would be split into its various ethnic denominations but no longer. The people seem to be uniting against the Taliban now while sympathy for fundamentalism is dropping as the coalition actually starts spending money on nation building and repair; the people are seeing a viable return on their immense suffering.

I would like to see Pakistan as we know it completely changed, with the military control broken and the people in charge. But I fear that without the strict Government enforcing order the country will split apart. All that is holding it together right now is the strict Islamisation implemented decades ago. The same kind exercised in the Pashtun tribal lands before the Soviet invasion.

I would like to see the destruction of the Islamic Republic of Iran preferably by the people, but most likely it will be through US airstrikes. The regime cannot be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons, if this was to happen, the region would become ground zero for world war three.

I would definitely like to see a Kurdistan, and I still cannot believe these long suffering people are ignored so nonchalantly by the international community. I would have thought Israel would seek a more vocal solidarity with the Kurds.

Iraq I think will be a success, they have elected a secular Prime Minister in Ayad Allawi deposing the previous administration who were trying to implement religious changes to the constitution while being a little too friendly with the IRI.

And of course I would like to see a solution in Israel/Palestine preferably a one state solution, but most likely a two. Obama needs to keep up the pressure on Netenyahu and his anhorrent right wing Government. Which just blatantly does not want peace, instead trying to exacerbate the situation at every oppurtunity.

Also the destruction of the authoritarian regimes surrounding Afghanistan most notably Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan. The strengthening of these regimes against their oppressed people was our shameful legacy in the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq. It is something we need to address within the next decade lest they also fall into ruin around a strict Islamic theocracy.

Nooooo Arabs are a monolithic bloc who want to kill everyone and institute sharia law! jfc has anyone here ever actually been to the Middle East, met any arabs, realized there are differences of opinion in the arab world etc?

I'm sorry but it's hardly an inaccurate "generalisation" to say that Arab states populations are virulently anti-Israel, and in many cases anti-semitic. No matter what their leaders think, the Arab media from PA TV to Saudi media is very, very, anti-Israel and denying this is merely fallacious. Also, arguing that Arab populations aren't anti-Israel on the basis of their unelected political leaders quietly(emphasis on quietly... why would they be if Israel is so well loved in Arab states) backing Israel against Hezbollah/Hamas is the height of stupidity.

Not to the extent you want to believe it is. The Iranian media is an example of a truly anti semetic agenda, the same goes for Syria. It is quite obvious that Egypt and Saudi are trying to diminish the ingrained hatred towards Israel which they themselves have cultivated over the decades. That isn't going to happen straight away though. Anybody with an ounce of intelligence would realise reality does not work like that. That is the reason i said 'quietly supporting' You think the Saudi Princes would retain a fraction of their control in that country if they paraded around mecca draped in the Israeli flag?

You don't think it's the case, and you're ignorant. The Arab leaders are mostly wholly Pro-Israel, the people of the Arab nations are not. Arab Media telling Arabs to feel under attack? Name me one.

Arabs aren't desert wanderers who need to be told their friend from foe.

Israel's neighbours are 'hostile' towards it because the zionist aim is to take over most of these countries and establish 'zion', as you would know had you done your research. What's amazing is that the leaders of these countries aren't even hostile (apart from maybe Syria) towards Israel, it's the people that are.

As for Hamas being a terrorist organisation, one mans terrorist is another mans freedom fighter. And no their aim is not soley military based, they are willing to negotiate but Israel holds the stance that it ' doesn't negotiate with terrorists. '

You seem to be missing the point here. Israels neighbours waged war on it because it was an occupying force to the region. How old is Israel?
Before 'Israel' came into existance there was a country called Palestine, I'm sure you know. You can't just come and impose your force on another country and expect them to split their land with you and kiss your feet.

Again, you've had your say I've had mine, don't turn this into a Palestine/ Israel thread.
 
 
UK  
 
 
I wouldnt be surprised if the US split (100 years) what with the different financial problems facing different states. I cant see Texans being all that happy about having to bail out their liberal left leaning brothers in California haha. As the US becomes more and more left leaning and socialised, I expect to see tensions between the fiscally conservative states and the spend thrifts, especially with the population ageing and the current systems of entitlements set to bankrupt the country.
 
 
Northern Ireland.
 
 
I would like to see "Northern Ireland" cease to exist, and I think this will almost certainly happen in the next 100 years.
I'd also like to see the "U"K as a whole cease to exist, with an independent Scotland, Wales and England, this seems less likely however when one considers what would have to come before this/what would be likely to come. England would offer Scotland greater devolution, and the ability of inhabitants to opt into Scottish as opposed to British citizenship before they allowed the last of their empire to slide away.

Basque independence is perhaps also a vague possibility and definitely something that I'd like to see.

Very unlikely.

There is AFAIK no organised independence movement for a seperate Pashtun state in Pakistan. Although Pashtuns are largely tribalistic they do show some degree of loyalty to Pakistan. During recent operations in the NWFP soldiers and journalists remarked how houses contained pictures of  Allama Iqbal  and  Jinna , foudning members of Pakistan. It could be argued that there is a Pashtun independence movement in Afghanistan in the form of the Taliban but the Taliban's alliance is only ot themselves. Pakistan has been faily liberal in granting autonomy to rural reigons, the NWFP where most Pakistani Pashtuns live is an autonomous reigon and it is currently reform is being introduced to rename it to Pashunistan etc.

There's a greater movement of independence in Kashmir but these are largely fringe groups and hardly a threat to Paksitan. Like the NWFP, Kashmir is also an autonomous reigon with it's own political apparatus. A united Kashmir is almost impossible as it would mean India and Pakistan both giving up control of some of their most fertile land.

The only real independence movement in Pakistan is the Balouchi seperation movement which really stems from inequal distribution of state resources with Balouchistan receiving the least. There's a similar movement in Iran but AFAIK both are largely small scale.
 
 
UK, Scotland will become Independent.

Look for yourself on Youtube at the thousands of clips of Saudi clerics on Arabic TV teaching hatred of Jews to millions of people, how they must rise up and kill the jews, and how another holocaust is necessary. And Egyptian tv. That's the Arab media I'm talking about.

I agree with you that the notion of "the Arabs" as being a homogeneous, monolithic group is an easy trap to fall down, as there are certainly significant cultural, social, even physical differences between the Arabs from the Levant and those of the Gulf states, not to mention an unbridgeable gap in matters of religion, but I disagree with your view on Syria and Saudi Arabia.

Are you talking about the people or the government?

Syrian people are generally quite liberal*, spiritual Muslims who disagree strongly with this "Islamist" craze, (although several Hizb-ut-Tahrir cells have been discovered there in recent years trying to spread their ideology.)
Travel to Damascus and see Muslims and millions of Christians etc living side by side in peace if you don't believe me.... You mentioned the caliphate in a recent post you quoted me on, but the "unified Islamic state" that founding Islamists refer to, Syrians generally speak of in disparaging terms "400-year Turkish occupation of Syria.".....

*(bar the odd moment of Holocaust denial, revering Hitler as a hero and saying killing Jews is acceptable.)

But Saudi Arabia?! Come off it. Even Syrians will tell you Saudi extremist influences are corrupting Islam in Syria. And this is despite Syria being considered part of the "axis of evil" and Saudi Arabia an "ally" in the fight against terrorism?!
Friends of mine have said how they've seen even their own family members undergo personality changes whilst working in Saudi Arabia, becoming stricter in their behavior claiming purity of religion, refusing to listen to music, meet female relatives, rampant Jew hatred and all the rest of it.

If you think Saudi Arabia is "Israel-friendly" you've got another thing coming. The House of Saud is sponsoring the training of clerics in to the Wahhabi mold, tens of thousands of which have been sent to all corners of the globe to propagate this form of Islam, including Britain.

It's this Wahhabbi doctrine that led to several British Muslims traveling to Israel to turn themselves into human bombs and kill Jews.

Saudi Arabia is at the very heart of extremism and it's export around the world.
Read the compulsory texts on "Islamic Culture" for all Saudi undergrads, regardless of subject, that teach things such as all forms of Islam except Wahhabism as being deviant, warning against the West, plurality and democracy and the pages devoted to blaming the Jews for the world's ills, citing ridiculous sources such as the "Learned Elders of Zion" as "evidence" - a book widely available in the Arab world that continues to be the source of "evidence" of a Jewish plan to dominate the Arab and wider world.

To this day, every Saudi embassy has a missionary army, staffed by Wahhabis, to monitor Muslim activity in the host country and help support Wahhabism financially, not to mention the Saudi funding of extremism mosques in Britain and else-where.

As for Egypt, a recipient of vast amounts of US/EU aid, well it's media produced a 41-pat TV series based on the Protocols, and broadcast it to the Arab world as recently as a few years ago.

And sorry, but you have no ******* clue what the Arabs would want if they were not oppressed any more. I'd like to see them given the chance to choose - at the moment, they do not.

 

Are you serious? I know that 70-80% of Saudi Arabia population like their current government. I know that UAE emirates like having free PhD and high class living as well as the Qatari’s, this government are offering their CITZENS the best living standards, even better than what UK is offering you and me. Who would want to chuck that away for democracy, secularity etc? Oman and Bahrain are doing pretty good for themselves, as well as Jordan, which is pretty moderate. Lebanon already has democracy and secularity.Yemen are doing the worst, but seeing as their GDP is low what did you expect? Kuwait is doing ok for itself and citizens. Syria already has secularity and has partial democracy as well as Iraq. Like the Romans said, “'Give them bread and circuses and they will never revolt”.

You must learn to discern between peoples and cultures. As Mr_K says, the Arabs are not a homogenous block.

 
Syrian people are generally quite liberal*
 

Syria is still officialy at war with Israel. They are heavy supporters of Hezbollah and hamas.

 
But Saudi Arabia?! Come off it. Even Syrians will tell you Saudi extremist influences are corrupting Islam in Syria. And this is despite Syria being considered part of the "axis of evil" and Saudi Arabia an "ally" in the fight against terrorism?!
 

If you knew anything about the region you would know that the worst nightmare of Saudi Arabia is IRI/Syrian supremacy in the region. Which is why we are allies with them. They are quite happy to maintain the region as it is. So are Egypt, hence their support of Israel against Hamas and Hezbollah.

I am not trying to say that it isn't an abhorrent theocracy. but you are mistaken in your assertion that it supports the current war against Israel. It would much rather see the destruction of the IRI, in fact there have been reports that Saudi is willing to open it's skies to Israel for a strike on Iran. Saudi is all about it's own supremacy, which is the reason it supports negotiations in Palestine. Anything to quell the IRI/Syrian proxies.

 
Friends of mine have said how they've seen even their own family members undergo personality changes whilst working in Saudi Arabia, becoming stricter in their behavior claiming purity of religion, refusing to listen to music, meet female relatives
 

Like i said. The regime supporting Israel against Hamas and Hezbollah doesn't mean it isn't a despicable one.

I never said they were Israel friendly. I said that they supported Israel in their battle against hamas and hezbollah.

 
Saudi Arabia is at the very heart of extremism and it's export around the world.
 

It is at the very heart of it's own brand of extremism. You are generalising again. These clerics are just as likely to support the bombing of sh'ia mosques as they are Israeli synagogues.

 
To this day, every Saudi embassy has a missionary army, staffed by Wahhabis, to monitor Muslim activity in the host country and help support Wahhabism financially, not to mention the Saudi funding of extremism mosques in Britain and else-where.
 

Precisely. You will find that neither Hamas, nor Hezbollah are Wahhabi proxies.

 
As for Egypt, a recipient of vast amounts of US/EU aid, well it's media produced a 41-pat TV series based on the Protocols, and broadcast it to the Arab world as recently as a few years ago.
 

I think you should go abck and read my original post.

Beyond Europe I agree with Democracy re the formation of a Kurdistan. Iraq has made that pretty much inevitable. Much else is unclear although one bet for certainty in my eyes is the Americas essentially remaining unchanged, especially in the South.

Well from an outsider looking in, three countries have already ceased to exist due to occupation, Palestine, Afghanistan and Iraq, so if it's a question of which countries will cease to exist? those three countries would be considered as they have lost their own voices and the ability to solve their own problems by themselves, due to imperialism and ''god given'' rights.

I think the next country to cease to exist will be Iran as the rhetoric from the west is pushing for another front out of their war machine.

A better question would be IMO, which countries will regain their existence.

So according to you. A country loses it's voice when the opressive dictator keeping the people brutally supressed is removed from power?  
 
 
Belgium will cease to exist.
Iran, Afghanistan and Iraq will hopefully cease to exist - Break them into smaller territories that recognise the different groups.

Hopefully Israel will exist.

And no, I don't give a flying **** what the bible says about it being entitled to you.

At what point did I deny that there weren't jews who were born 1st generation in Israel? You think because you've occupied stolen land for 60 years it should now be entitled to you for eternity?

Whatever, I suggest you calm down. This is nothing to do with jews. I would like to see Israel wiped off the maps and a new, single, unified Palestinian state. With a secular, democratic, non-funded, self-standing government. This is something I will never stop fighting for, regardless of how many wimps like you think it's 'selfish' to y'know, claw back stolen land and then quote me Wikipedia articles about pretty irrelevant jewish terms.

Erm, yes. If you're born in a country that is your country for ever. If we use your argument then all of the region should be Jewish, as why should those who expelled the Jews thousands of years ago still be entitled to the land for eternity?

By not recognising that first, second and third generation Israeli born Jews deserve their own state, you're being anti-Semitic. You have to recognise that Jews from the region deserve a state just as much as the Palestinians do.

 
Whatever, I suggest you calm down. This is nothing to do with jews.
 

Yes it has. You're talking about replacing the Jewish state with a Palestinian state.

 
I would like to see Israel wiped off the maps and a new, single, unified Palestinian state.
 

Where do the Jews go, and do they not deserve a state or something?

 
With a secular, democratic, non-funded, self-standing government.
 

The Israeli government is secular. And what difference does it make whether it is funded or not?

 
This is something I will never stop fighting for, regardless of how many wimps like you think it's 'selfish'
 

Good for you. But you're the reason the fighting keeps going on - you've made it clear that you don't want a Jewish state anywhere in the region. That's pathetic.

 
to y'know, claw back stolen land and then quote me Wikipedia articles about pretty irrelevant jewish terms.

I pretty much stopped bothering to listen to you when you said this. Biggest facepalm moment, EVAR.   But hey, seen as you're look through the forums trying to find anything remotely related to Israel, I'll humour you.

I'm not talking about a jewish state, I'm talking about the dissolution of an Israeli state. Where do the jews go? No where, seen as (what seems like tiny fraction of) the jews of Israel were actually born in Israel. I don't see much sense in turning them away, however, the land and the resources that the zionist state has created was carved out of Palestinian territories by Britain and the United States of America. I'd like to see all the people currently residing with Palestine and the occupied territories under one united government and to have a comprehensive non-discriminatory immigration policy.

It's not very secular to say 'hey, all the jews come to the stolen land y'all' now is it?   As for being anti semetic...   it's pretty typical for people like you anyway. 'DON'T LIKE ISRAEL? ANTI-SEMITE!!'  

Just grow a pair, honestly. You're pathetic

You're denying the Jews a right to self determination in a land that they have lived in for thousands of years. That's anti-Semitism. Jews are not just a religion - we're a people and a nation. Of course its secular to say come to this country, purchase some land and then the UN will make a Jewish majority state alongside an Arab one.

I am not arguing with you any longer because you make me want to kill myself with your stupidity.

The hatred of people of Jewish descent.

Discrimination against or persecution of the Jews because of their religious beliefs or race.

Funny that. Anti-semitism is not the same as disagreeing with your geo-political views about who deserves to live on stolen land and who is entitled to the land that they've lived in for thousands of years.

  Are the jews in that photograph at a pro-palestinian freedom rally 'anti-semetic'?

The truth is, being anti-semetic is not the same as being an anti-zionist. but people like you are too pathetic to come up with decent enough arguments to justify their brutalisation and dehumanisation of the Palestinian people and their right to THEIR land, so calling me an anti-semite is probably your best bet. You'll go really far in life like that  

Ironically, people like you who believe Israel belongs exclusively to jewish zionists who stole the land in the 1940s, fuel more anti-semitism than you do to put a stop to it. What a shame :/

Denying Jews the right to self determination below any other nation fits into quite a few of them.

Why pick on Israel all the time? Why obsess over this and ignore other issues?

I understand that many people have good reason to highlight the Israel/Palestine conflict (their family background, religion, whatever), but there are many, many more who jump on the bandwagon for all the wrong reasons, and this is when it starts to border on anti-semitism.

I don't believe for a minute that simply denying Israel's right to exist is anti-semitism. But many of those who do so have anti-semitic intentions.

First of all, calm the **** down. Secondly, it makes little to no sense for a fairly wide portion of the jewish community to denounce the actions of Israel for all the pain and suffering they have caused, all in the name of selfish occupation of another's land. The Anti-Zionist jews are not anti-semites, and that's what it is about people like you. Anti-Zionism is exactly the same as Anti-Semitism in your eyes. You feel any opposition to your political ideas as an attack on your religion. Well to be honest, I don't give a rats arse how offended you are. Many jews share my views on Israel, so go ahead an be offended. I have no reason to be anything but indifferent toward the Jewish religion.

Secondly, why should a people who's land has been continously stolen and occupied compromise? I don't agree with a two state solution for two reasons.

1. It's not a fair deal
2. It won't work

I'd like to see how many Palestinians would be happy with accepting a measley portion of their land back, and I'd like to see how many Israelis would be happy giving back some of the land they've managed to steal from Palestinian families. I want one country, united over their land, jews AND non-jewish people. Israel and the zionist movement are the exact opposite of that.

But hey, why would I give two ***** what people like you think? Your argument is the equivalent of saying 'You hate Iran? YOU HATE ISLAM! HOW DARE YOU BE SO ISLAMOPHOBIC! FFFFUUUU..'

I really couldn't care less about how zionists feel they're entitled to stolen land. It just highlights their greed and simplicity and just how low they'll sink to keep their claws into occupied territory.

I think you're absolutely right. Unfortunately, some people who have somewhat similar views to me on the Israel/Palestine situation are anti-semites and I completely denounce them. I wouldn't want to personally associate with anti-semites and find it just as disgraceful as Islamophobia.

As for your other point, yep. Many othere places do face such cases, and on a much bigger scale too. The truth is, the Israel/Palestine conflict is the most high profile case because it has such a rich history of relationships, Britain, Muslims, Jews, Israel, Palestine, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, The United States of America, Syria and even Saudi Arabia (to a lesser degree) all have some stake or previous involvement with the issue, so it's become a highly politicisised conflict which draws emotion into the debate, especially as the creation of Israel followed the jewish holocaust.

Though, I don't think highlighting the crimes of other countries and the scale of them negates Israels disgraceful human rights track, or the fact they are occupying more territory every day. The Israeli UN Ambassador is trying to make the same case saying that the UN is 'unfairly demonising Israel', which I don't think is the case at all. I just think there's a lot of pressure due to the high about of media attention the situation gets, but yes. All issues like this should be given equal care and diligence.

Eh? I'm probably on your side in this argument, but you seem to be saying that anyone who isn't a Zionist is an anti-Semite. That's just laughable (and makes a mockery of real anti-Semitism).

I'm not saying that at all. I'm saying that denying the Jews the right to a homeland below every other people is anti-Semitism, and it's exactly what jjhc is proposing through his one state solution.

From what I've read his position is that the land is stolen, and should be returned to it's rightful occupants. Whether he is right or wrong, that doesn't seem to be denying Jews have the right to self-determination, it is denying that Jews have the right to self-determination in (what he sees as) what is primarily someone else's homeland.

Let's just imagine that it was proven that almost all of Israel was stolen from other people. It would not be anti-Semitic and it would not be denying Jewish self-determination to say that the state of Israel is illegitimate and is based on land stolen from others. That wouldn't be anti-Semitism at all, and to say that it is, would be a form of racism by placing Jews above other people, namely the Palestinians.

Now, I don't agree that the land is stolen, and I do believe in Israel's right to exist, but other people have differences of opinion over the land, and it is a poor debating tactic to just label them anti-Semitic and say that they don't believe the Jews have the right to self-determination.

He might be an anti-Semite, but I haven't really seen any evidence of that so far.
 
 
From your position, this also follows - anyone who supports the Palestinian right of return is an anti-Semite because allowing all the Palestinians to reclaim their old land would (some would argue) destroy the Jewish nature of the state of Israel, and thus, I guess, compromise Jewish self-determination.

Yet, it should be pretty clear that many of those who believe in the right of return believe in it because they think it is just, not because they are anti-Semites.

But the thing is, he's not an anti-semite, is he? He doesn't hate Jews and he's not denying Jewish people the right to self-determination; he's denying it in the area where it's currently happening. And (I assume) not because he doesn't want the Jews to have a homeland, but because he doesn't like that fact that Palestine has been affected as a result.

I don't agree with his point of view, but to say that it's anti-semitic is unfair. Views like his may lead to anti-semitism, and they may be caused or exaggerated by anti-semitic motives, but the views in themselves do not constitute anti-semitism. Not in my opinion anyway.

No they have not!

I am sick to death of hearing this rubbish. Modern-day Jews, who are no more related to ancient Jews than modern-day Palestinians are, began illegally immigrating into Palestine under the British mandate from the 1920s onwards.

The Arabs have lived in that land for thousands of years up to the modern day, and yet each and every year more are evicted and pushed out, maimed and killed by Israel - is that not far, far worse than a couple of idiots going around saying "kill all Jews". It is.   Because actions mean far more than petty words.

What the Israelis complain is said against the Jews (desires for ethnic cleansing, humiliation, brutality, eviction and teleological extermination) is what the Israelis actually do to the Palestinians!

See the double standards for yourself, please.

Oh, and as for the "thousands of years" these people following Judaism lived in Old Judea, how are they in any phyogenetic way more related to modern-day Jews (after thousands of years of breeding) than any other people? And even if they were, how does this even matter?! My ancestors were undoubtedly inhabitants of Africa for thousands of years before my traceable ancestors found themselves in India - does that give me a rightful claim to Africa?  

 
That's anti-Semitism. Jews are not just a religion - we're a people and a nation.
 

Jews are not a single genetic peoples any more than most broadly ethnic groups are, and most educated Israelis and Jews acknowledge that, even a few of the Israelis you call your "zionist brothers" on this site.

Read Shlomo Sand's "The Invention of the Jewish People" - written by an Israeli Jew, so accuse him of anti-semitism.  

And as for the Jews being a nation - I don't quite understand that. The Jews today have a nation - yes, Israel. But the Jews are not "a nation" in themselves, they are a bunch of people across the world who share a religious / cultural link, as you acknowledge.

What kind of rubbish is it that causes an intelligent person to scream "anti-semitism" in the modern day, against anybody who dares to criticise Israel despite the overwhelming objective UN and other evidence condemning Israel as one of the most despicable countries on Earth today, in terms of practising ethnic cleansing, terrorism, apartheid, restriction of humanitarian aid and water and committing war crimes against civilian populations - and yet you still have the audacity to declare Israel a hub of human rights!

I will criticise Israel whole-heartedly and no that does not make me an anti-semite in the slightest. Do you condemn Kurdish terrorism against Iraqis or Iranians? Because they are a people too without a nation, but criticism of their actions (which I assume you'll readily engage in) is not tantamount to calling for the death of all Kurds. In the same way, please open your eyes and realise that passionate anti-zionists do not hate Jews.

In fact, I romanticise about the days when the Jews flourished in Arabia, living at peace with Arab neighbours and being highly successful in their generally open and well-cultured societies. Is this not what you want too, to be able to celebrate Jewish festivals without having to be extra cautious of a foreign attack just due to the fact that it is the day of atonement or Yom Kippur? I know that is what a hell of a lot of anti-Israel rabbis across the world want - and that is what I want for the Jewish people too: peace, prosperity and security.

But I will never support Jewish security when that comes at the costly price of millions of Palestinian homes, schools, hospitals, Mosques, markets, farms, lands and lives - because that "security" is stolen by force, and not deserved and nor should it be given, or Israel will only raise its powerful arm again and again.

 
Of course its secular to say come to this country, purchase some land and then the UN will make a Jewish majority state alongside an Arab one.
 

Again - Jewish majority. How is this fair at all?

Nothing but love for Jews - but let me admit it, I hate the so-called "State of Israel", and as I've explained, with bloody good reason. Peace out.

Thank you.

In fact, replace the word "Jews" with "people" in the emboldened part above and that summarises the view of almost all pro-Palestinians today.

I've tried to explain this many times, with varying success.

To sum it up: anti-zionists today may be yelling "Jews out of illegally occupied land" but they are not yelling that because the people are Jews! I assure you, if British people occupied the land, the chants would go "British out", or if it were the Sikhs (from a number of countries), the chants would go "Sikhs out".

The reason it is "Jews out" is because the people who illegally occupy this land self-identify as Jews, whether that's as an alleged people or members of a religion or whatever.

Pro-Palestinians want illegal settlers out of Palestinian land which was very recently stolen from them. The fact that these people are Jews is why people want the Jews out - not because they inherent value Jewish life after other peoples or whatever rubbish you may speculate.  

In reality, I put it to you that the Israelis are the racists, valuing Jewish life infinitely more and granting so many rights to Jews in illegally occupied territories which Palestinians are banned from. (Such as forcing Jewish settlers to be armed but killing any Palestinian who has a weapon, despite the fact it is his land anyway). I don't think like that and neither do most pro-Palestinians. We believe (generally) in equality of all people and the Israelis here deserve serious action against them, not because they're Jewish but because of what they have done and continue to do.

Oh nonsense. There were always Jews in the area. And there's no such thing as "illegal immigration" to a colony. For immigration to be "illegal" there would have to be a state in place to enforce it - there wasn't. Please realise that after the Holocaust the immigrants to the region were not immigrants - they were refugees. Just as someone fleeing Afghanistan and the Taleban now is a refugee.

 
The Arabs have lived in that land for thousands of years up to the modern day, and yet each and every year more are evicted and pushed out, maimed and killed by Israel - is that not far, far worse than a couple of idiots going around saying "kill all Jews". It is.   Because actions mean far more than petty words.
 

Palestinian Exodus = 650,000 - 700,000 refugees (mainly in Jordan, Egypt and the West Bank).
Jewish exodus from Arab lands = 850,000 - 1,000,000 refugees expelled from Arab lands and settled in Israel. They had nowhere else to go.

 
What the Israelis complain is said against the Jews (desires for ethnic cleansing, humiliation, brutality, eviction and teleological extermination) is what the Israelis actually do to the Palestinians!

See the double standards for yourself, please.
 

Oh for God's sake listen to yourself! "Extermination"? Get a ******* grip.

 
Oh, and as for the "thousands of years" these people following Judaism lived in Old Judea, how are they in any phyogenetic way more related to modern-day Jews (after thousands of years of breeding) than any other people? And even if they were, how does this even matter?! My ancestors were undoubtedly inhabitants of Africa for thousands of years before my traceable ancestors found themselves in India - does that give me a rightful claim to Africa?  
 

I wasn't actually using that argument. Go back and read it. JJHC said that all of the land should be Palestine because they were expelled, and I said it'd be just as ridiculous to argue Jews have a right to the land because their ancestors were expelled thousands of years ago.  

 
Jews are not a single genetic peoples any more than most broadly ethnic groups are, and most educated Israelis and Jews acknowledge that, even a few of the Israelis you call your "zionist brothers" on this site.

Read Shlomo Sand's "The Invention of the Jewish People" - written by an Israeli Jew, so accuse him of anti-semitism.  
 

You've mentioned this a few times -  here's a review  of his book.

"There's plenty more to criticize with Judt, but one more point to ponder: if Jewish nationalism, an unbroken idea that spans millennia, is a myth, how real is Palestinian Arab nationalism?"

 
And as for the Jews being a nation - I don't quite understand that. The Jews today have a nation - yes, Israel. But the Jews are not "a nation" in themselves, they are a bunch of people across the world who share a religious / cultural link, as you acknowledge.
 

Yes, a culture. A people. We share a religious/cultural link just as a nation does.

 
What kind of rubbish is it that causes an intelligent person to scream "anti-semitism" in the modern day, against anybody who dares to criticise Israel despite the overwhelming objective UN and other evidence condemning Israel as one of the most despicable countries on Earth today, in terms of practising ethnic cleansing, terrorism, apartheid, restriction of humanitarian aid and water and committing war crimes against civilian populations
 

And off you go with your buzzwords that are merely opinion (mostly of Arab nations that uphold these policies legally). I was saying that it is anti-Semitic to replace a Jewish state and an occupied Palestinian land with a full Palestinian state and denying the millions of Jews there they right to self determination.

 
and yet you still have the audacity to declare Israel a hub of human rights!
 

In light of all other parties in the region, yes. It is.

 
I will criticise Israel whole-heartedly and no that does not make me an anti-semite in the slightest.
 

Of course it doesn't.

 
Do you condemn Kurdish terrorism against Iraqis or Iranians?
 

  - are you actually asking me if I condemn terrorism? Goes far in explaining why you are so eager to defend the actions of Hamas, who you see as a "liberation force".

 
Because they are a people too without a nation, but criticism of their actions (which I assume you'll readily engage in) is not tantamount to calling for the death of all Kurds.
 

I know they are a people without a nation (as are the Tibetans who have had worse actions committed against them by the Chinese than the Palestinians have by the Israelis - going to criticise this as vehemently?) I never said that opposing it is like calling for the death of them all - just that denying them the right to self determination when giving it to another group is racism. Of course, the Kurdish terrorists (like the Chechens) need to stop their terrorist acts before they get a state - which is why the Palestinians are yet to have one.

 
In the same way, please open your eyes and realise that passionate anti-zionists do not hate Jews.
 

I know they don't - but a lot of them do.

I know that is what a hell of a lot of anti-Israel rabbis across the world want - and that is what I want for the Jewish people too: peace, prosperity and security.
 

Then you have to realise that Hamas, Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad etc. are doing damage to this thought, and the only way to stop them is to hunt them down and kill them.

 
But I will never support Jewish security when that comes at the costly price of millions of Palestinian homes, schools, hospitals, Mosques, markets, farms, lands and lives - because that "security" is stolen by force, and not deserved and nor should it be given, or Israel will only raise its powerful arm again and again.

Again - Jewish majority. How is this fair at all?
 

  There is a region with predominately two peoples. There are 11.5 million people - 6 million Jews and 5.5 million Palestinians. How is a two state solution, one with a Jewish majority and one with a Palestinian majority, not fair?

 
Nothing but love for Jews - but let me admit it, I hate the so-called "State of Israel", and as I've explained, with bloody good reason. Peace out.  
 

Out of curiosity, do you support a two state solution? If so under what boundaries and what concessions would be made?

Like the Lehi and Irgun stopped committing terrorist acts before the UN decided to create the state of Israel right?

Israel may be gone. Greater Syria will form.

India and Bangladesh may look very different to today.

African countries may unite or be affected by major starvation, water shortages and desertification. They'll have to leave.

But we were referring to the Jewish homeland. They are a distinct group in the area, and if he said that the Tibetans don't deserve a state I would have accused him of racism in that case too.

Well its only in the eyes of ours that they are dictators, even though we groomed them most of the time and when I say I care for those nations, I mean that I personally would choose a dictator that had the divided sunnis and shias under control, kinda like Abraham Lincoln when he united the states, not a puppet of the Americans who only wish to occupy and manipulate their government to the westerns liking for their oil. In that sense their resistance is as legitimate as one's right to life. hopefully the world will see.
 
 
Well with the Israeli's using so much ******* white phosphorous on Innocent Civilian Palestinians its hard to say there will be much of Palestine left.

The UN themselves have condemmened this action as a WAR CRIME.
 
 
Israel, North + South Korea, Moldova, Vatican City, Andorra, Puerto Rico, Taiwan, Somalia, and UAE all face a potential massive change in their status.

North + South Korea can't stay split forever. Israel's position was never established as safe, it faces a dark future without more apartheid measures and higher Jewish birth rates. Moldova is an uncertain and weak country. It could fragment and become pieces of Ukraine and Romania. Puerto Rico might become either a US state or an independent nation. Vatican City only remains sovereign as long as the Catholic Church exists, really. Somalia is barely a nation as it is.
The rest of them are in uncertain positions due to their identities.

So, just the ones that supposedly threaten national security? Compared to Turkish restrictions on political behaviour and expression, that is mild. Many democracies ban political parties for various reasons - doing so does not make a country (necessarily) undemocratic.
 
 
Well, I HOPE that every E.U country will cease to exist as a country and will be states in a Federal Europe... well, I can always dream!

Interestingly Belarus may cease to exist. Of all the countries that split from the USSR Belarus is the only one who retained very close relations with Russia, to the point where there were talks of creating a state of Russia and Belarus. The talks stalled however I wouldn't be surprised if, in our lifetimes at least, they start up again.

Surely if that happened, Belarus would really become just another federal subject of Russia? I can't see it being an equal partnership. After all, I'm sure the culture in Belarus is closer to Russian culture than the culture in many parts of Russia.

Oh yeah thats pretty much how it'd be I imagine. There is no way on earth that Belarus would have any power in that monopoly. Also like you said, Belarus is more Russian than many parts of Russia. Belarus and Russia are very much like the UK & Ireland in that apart from the differing currencies, culturally they're very very similar to the point where they speak virtually/entirely the same language, and if you're travelling between the two there's very little difference.
 
 
Israel will cease to exist if the left-wing get their way.

On a related note, though, I'd like to see regions such as the Basque, Catalonia, Waziristan, Quebec, Tamil, Flanders etc. gain greater autonomy and independence.

The bans weren't upheld in the Supreme Court. If you'll look at the Knesset Arab parties hold 14 out of 120 seats.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knesset#Current_Knesset 

And to be honest those parties deserve banning for openly supporting enemy states... half of their MKs have committed treason by visiting and supporting Syria and Hezbollah! I'd like to see a pro-Al-Qaeda US senator.

5. Mexico (Rapidly becoming a failed state)
6. Kosovo (Serbian minority unstable; everyone else basically Albanian.)
7. Korea

I get the feeling that one day there will be an independent Kurdistan. I also think a two state solution re Israel-Palestine may one day be reached.

I don't think the Basque seperatists will ever be successful.

I think Korean re-unification may eventually be reached, especially after the death of the Dear Leader  

 

I'm guessing with you supporting secularism in the Middle East you are also including the termination of the 'Jewish' state of Israel?
 
 
From what I see at the present time, Israel's tactics are making a two state solution impossible.
Hence a one state solution seems to be the only solution in the horizon.
The fact that the Arab population is going to consitiute more than 50% of the population in the land between the river and the sea (river of Jordan and the Med that is), the Jewish state of Israel as we know it is going to cease to exist.

And I think the EU is going to adopt a federal system, with the UK breaking up into England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

But Israel is also a secular state. It's for the Jewish people, not necessarily people of the Jewish religion. As I understand it, the Jewish religion has as much influence in government decisions as other religions do in other secular countries. Not that I'm saying I necessarily agree that there should be a state for the Jewish people.

No they are not. European Jews are not 'indigenous' to the area between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River.

You can't expel inhabitants of an occupied territory because you believe a certain religious group had claims to it 2000 years ago based on ridiculous theistic myths.

That is not a secular state's legislations.

Couldn't get any better!

A secular fanatic asking for dismantling his own country's most capable regime in over a century in favour of systems like "materialism"   now claims that Jews that were born in Poland, eastern europe were living in Palestine for millenia.

Who is the current prime minister of the FZE (Failed Zionist Entity)? Who was the previous PM of the FZE? Where were their parents born? Where were those two PMs born?

Not only that, Ethiopian and Indian jews have nothing to do with "indigenous" Palestinian people.

As if to exemplify what level of irresponsibility is engendered by the Zionist lobby and supportive media in western immoral countries, they even published (pseudo)scientific articles claiming Ethiopian Jews and Indian Jews have more in common with Eastern European (Slavic countries') Jews than with Ethiopians or Indians in terms of DNA.

Religious belief has nothing to do with it.

A Jew can also be an atheist and still immigrate to Israel.

In fact, both my cousins and my aunt are not Jewish at all, but they still immigrated because my uncle is, and he's an atheist.

I am not stupid. I know that they don't check whether Jews actually believe in God and the Torah to get into the country.
But Judism is NOT an ethnicity, it's a religion. Therefore a secular state the discriminates based on RELIGIOUS belief, isn't really secular. IMO.
