This week has made me very stabby toward the people in DC. I have been here over a year and a half, so for it to just happen this week is surprising. I know not everyone here is bad, but this past week it has gotten to me. I have gotten used to the typical no door holding, no please and thank yous, etc. Today a man fell off of his bike and most people walked right by him and that infuriated me. I can't get over not letting elderly with canes not sit down on the metro because a late twenties person won't offer their seat. The city is eating me alive right now and I want to go sit in a cabin in the woods and be alone for the weekend.

So for fun, the following is what I would love in a city, have you been somewhere like this or know of where I would be happy?? Must have: cooler winters, by the water, city with culture and arts, people that don't care about what you do for a living, people that can stop talking about work when they leave and people who will not try to convince me how awesome they are because of where they went to school and how much they make, dont care about the label you are wearing, havent been to a plastic surgeon by 30, wont think twice about someone wearing flipflops, a hat and tank on the weekends, say good morning, hold doors, dont fly confederate flags, and are just genuinely good people.

That all sums up the other places I have tried. After all of that, where would you recommend?? :)
 
 
Seattle
 
 
Portland, OR
 
 
San Francisco meets most of that, depending on your definition of a cool winter and what neighborhood you're in.
LA definitely does not.
Actually Charlottesville, VA meets most of that too--but it's tiny.
 
 
If you can give up living by the water, I'd go to Asheville, NC. Though people don't like to talk about work there because a lot of them don't ;) Dirty hippies.
 
 
Minneapolis?
 
 
I know what you mean about the northeast; we have a lot of business contacts around there and that is the mentality we tend to encounter/the stereotypical judgements we have made about there. I'm sorry it's got to you this week :( buuuut your dream city sounds kind of like Huntsville, AL :) haha only our water is lakes or rivers (is that okay?)
 
 
I don't live there, but I think Milwaukee fits a lot of your wants.
 
 
Ahhh Houston has almost all of those. Our water (beach) isn't pretty and people don't like our summers because they are hot. I wouldn't consider our winters cool either. Every other point you are looking for is here.
 
 
When you say water, does a big lake count? Burlington, Vermont and Portland, Maine are both really cool cities. Small though and not too sure of their job markets.

SF was actually our next choice, but so far away from family, so we chose here. Wish we would have gone there instead right now.
 
 
More locally, I loved living in the city of Frederick. It's still close to dc and bmore, it has a large arts community, history, nice local people, a lot of families and commuters, very close to some nice countryside and farmers markets, etc.
People seem to be friendly without being overly so. But it's not a huge city, so I'm not sure if your looking for something larger.
 
 
Everything you posted about is why I live in Baltimore and commute to DC (Bethesda actually, but inside the beltway). We could not stand DC and DH flat out refused to move back.
 
 
Baltimore was a bit like that, but I'm sure it has a lot to do with what social circles you run.
But it doesn't have a subway system and it not the seat of government for the most powerful superpower on earth.

I prefer oceans and beaches, but that's because I am from FL. At this point, I just want water, cool weather and bonfires with friends far, far away from the city. :)
 
 
I think you want a city in the Midwest (anything but Chicago.).
I'm think Minneapolis is your best bet.
 
 
Portland, OR. I've lived in many places and it truly is different here.
 
 
Ditto the Portland, Ore. or Seattle suggestions.
 
 
Portland, OR.
Our water isn't really pretty (I swear they photoshop it in magazines) but the Columbia is pretty and coast isn't far. We don't have SF cost. Hooray for PNW!
 
 
I think people are friendly in DC. I never get why people say its unfriendly, I guess I just haven't had that experience.
ETA: People do talk a lot about work here, I will admit that.
 
 
If you don't mind rivers, Pittsburgh fits your bill. People are amazingly nice, there's a decent arts scene---lots of local theater companies, galleries, etc. Tons of local parks and lakes within driving distance.
 
 
 http://www.cityofpt.us/ 
This is a tiny city in the pacific northwest that is very arts centered. I've never lived there, only visited.

I agree 100%.
The people are one of the reasons I love this area so much. Not a whole lot of pretense, none of that passive-aggressive "bless your heart" crap. I find most people to be friendly and helpful but not overly intrusive or annoying about it, which I like. I mean, there are asssholes everywhere, it's not a dc thing.

eta: Yeah, there is a lot of "Where did you go to school?", "What do you do?" around here. People are always looking to make contacts. lol

So far just this week, I had a girl on my hall shut the elevator door in my face when I was less than 15 feet behind her, watched an elderly man fight to hold on to the metro pole because the people sitting down didn't offer thier seat, saw a man literally pick up and move someone elses bags that were saving her seat at lunch so she lost her seat and he put her food on the floor. It's not that everyone is unfriendly, it's more that people just don't care about anyone else and when you do something nice like hold open the door no one says thank you because they feel like you should do that for them. It's just very different from what I am used to.
 
 
Seattle. Although, there's not a lot of sun unless it's summer.
 
 
I find DC friendly as well, but I could see how a recent transplant might think otherwise. It takes a while to find a neighborhood and community that suits you in a city with so many young professionals without any community roots and so many self important 24 year olds.
OP, I'm sorry your having such a bad week. One of the reasons I don't ride the metro is that it puts me in a terrible mood. Though I attribute 70% of that to WMATA incompetence and the remainder to general asshattery. I commute on a bicycle and find that 95% of the population is friendly and respectful of my place on the road. Sometimes I'm surprised by how much actually. Most of the remaining 5% seems to be from MD :)
 
 
Do you want a big city or a smaller place? I'd agree that Charlottesville is very nice and close to DC for if you need the 'big city' nearby, but definitely has a more small town/city feel.
 
 
I would vote for Chicago. You do have some status stuff going on, but for the most part I found that people were cool when I lived there. I would love to go back.
 
 
 
Minneapolis?

 

I vote for Minneapolis too! There is plenty of water, just not all in one place.
 
 
 
Ahhh Houston has almost all of those. Our water (beach) isn't pretty and people don't like our summers because they are hot. I wouldn't consider our winters cool either. Every other point you are looking for is here.

 

I agree although I did see my first confederate flag flying last fall but that is a rare occurance.
People are definitely caring here, for example yesterday a guy wouldn't let me sit in a vacated seat at a large gathering ( no assigned seating) and several people shot him horrified looks and immediately got up and offered me their seats.
 
 
Canada.

where in FL are you from? I find the ppl in DC just as friendly as the ppl from the tampa bay area, maybe even more so b/c the area is so transient that ppl are more open to meeting new ppl.

i guess it's all about your circle. all of my friends are normal, nice, able to talk about things other than work, etc.

shrugs.
i do find it sad re: metro, but i don't necessarily attribute it to rudeness as much as ppl reading & not noticing a person needing a seat enter the car. this is why i rarely opt for a seat in a busy car b/c I'd rather read (standing up) than inadvertently be rude.
you should come to dc nestie gtg. nice women hold open doors, save seats & can talk about things other than work.
 
 
Madison, WI
 
 
 
 
Minneapolis?

 

I vote for Minneapolis too! There is plenty of water, just not all in one place.

 

Minneapolis is where it's at. They don't call us "Minnesota Nice" for no reason :-)
 
 
St Paul/Minneapolis, MN. It's everything you're describing, as long as you consider lakes and rivers to be "near the water". There's more shoreline in MN than FL, CA and HI combined!
 
 
I would say Baltimore - I think we're nice here - but they will still ask you where you went to school, only they mean high school, because we can tell a lot about someone based on where they went. lol.
One of my oldest friends (who lived in NYC for years and is now in Boston) spent a few years in DC after graduating from College Park and hated it. She loved the city itself - the restaurants, the bars, all that stuff - but she said it stressed her out because she felt like people were always discussing politics (but all her friends were congressional staffers, I know lots of people from DC who never discuss politics) and that business and networking just never stopped. She loved New York and likes Boston but says that there was something more......uptight....I guess...about DC.
I've never particularly noticed it but I've never lived in DC or spent extended amounts of time there although I know a bunch of people from the suburbs.
 
 
I second Portland, ME! Smaller city than what you're used to and definitely cold (not cooler lol) winters, but it has every other positive thing you mentioned!
 
 
you're hanging with the wrong crowd.
the funny thing about d.c. is that, in my experience, the people with the most power and influence seem to be the ones with the least pretense. when i first moved here, and hung around with the mid-20's crowd, it was exponentially more annoying. most of the annoying people i know moved away, and the people I am around now are settled in.
 
 
Philly fits a lot of those (although Philadelphians can be a bit salty).
Brooklyn? Really, there is a lot of NY generally like that -- just stay away from the investment banking crowd :) (There's probably a lot of DC like that too but I know what you mean -- whenever I go to DC I feel that all anyone wants to talk about is what they do for a living/where they went to school/politics. I'm not interested in any talking about of those things   But really, it could be a matter of who you're talking to rather than the city itself.)
 
 
Portland, Maine
It doesn't have the same kind of intensity as living in a bigger city. I grew up in NoVa and lived there for a few years after college. I'm much happier since I moved to Maine.
 
 
Grand Rapids, Michigan
Cooler Winters: Yes, but it comes with a lot of snow most years.
By the water: Lake Michigan is 45 minutes away and has great beaches.
Culture and Arts: Great live music and a huge art competition each year that brings artists in from all over.
Very down to earth.
Charlottesville, VA is one of my favorite places too. It's a great college town.
 
 
 
Portland, OR.
Our water isn't really pretty (I swear they photoshop it in magazines) but the Columbia is pretty and coast isn't far. We don't have SF cost. Hooray for PNW!

 

Another vote for Portland. We'd move there in a heartbeat if it didn't mean taking another Bar exam  
 
 
I prefer Nashville to Seattle (lived there a decade). I like to see the sun.
All I know is the infrequent flyer of the confederate flag would be likely to help me if I needed it and hold the door for me. My kids listened to live Western African drumming last weekend at the library, a coworker of mine hosts poetry at a coffee house....we have a wonderful art center and symphony hall--- it is as cultural as you make it.
 
 
St.Pete, FL
I don't live there, about an 1.5hrs north. I was there this wknd. Lots of neat shops, tons of restaurants. The Dali museum is downtown, Holocaust museum is downtown. On the water. Winters are... interesting. Freezing over the weekend, supposed to be 80 by Thursday.
 
 
 
San Francisco meets most of that, depending on your definition of a cool winter and what neighborhood you're in.
LA definitely does not.
Actually Charlottesville, VA meets most of that too--but it's tiny.

 

Is exactly what I was going to say. There are still some people who are pretentious in their artsiness, hippiness, growing their own food-ness, but overall its a cool city. Not by the water though.

Um what??
 
 
I think you are hanging out with the wrong crowd in DC. ;-)
I live in the DC area too, have most of my life. I do agree that the metro sucks. However, I regular ride the bus, and people are very nice. The bus driver greets me by name every day. I have seen people offer others a ride home from their bus stop and jump off the bus and run after someone who forgot their phone. (The bus driver waited.)
People regularly hold doors for each other at my office. Customer service does suck a lot of places, but I've found that in most big cities. Power (or perceived power or proximity to power) is a big deal in this city, but there are also a lot of people who simply don't care who you are or who you know.
FWIW, when I travel to southern VA and around Lancaster PA, I am always surprised by how nice strangers are.
 
 
Providence, RI
Portland, ME
Burlington, VT
Except I am not sure that anyone will hold the door for you or elevator for you in these cities. I will admit that I am the first person rapidly hitting the "door close" button in an elevator.
That being said I do try to hold doors for people, but not holding the door doesn't make a city, rude, IMO. It's just so cold and people are in a hurry.

I am actually from Tampa, and yes, the people here remind me of the South/Downtown Tampa people. I didn't like them in Fl either. I also lived in Miami and the FL Keys, but couldn't find the right place to live. Miami was too LA for me and the Keys didn't have a job market. I work in Investment Sales and my friends are CPA's so I am constantly around these type of crowds, which is why I have the issues I do. I haven't been able to meet any other type of people because I don;t know where they are. lol I would love to come to a DC gtg!!
 
 
Minneapolis/St. Paul. Definately. We have an amazing amount of arts and culture here. And back when I was riding the bus to get to work, I once saw three people get up at the same time to offer a boarding pregnant woman a seat.
 
 
Pittsburgh PA

Only caveat is the "by the water" part, although we do have three rivers! Plus we have been on all kinds of lists for being one of the greatest places to live.
 
 
I think Chicago fits all your requirements. My in-laws (who have lived in Maryland, Virginia, Kansas, Florida and Texas) all say that Chicago is the friendliest place they've ever been.
 
 
 
If you don't mind rivers, Pittsburgh fits your bill. People are amazingly nice, there's a decent arts scene---lots of local theater companies, galleries, etc. Tons of local parks and lakes within driving distance.

 

and it's fairly cheap, but the job market can be iffy, which is why we moved away...
 
 
This sounds exactly like Santa Cruz, CA to me. I lived there for years and it is a fabulous place to live.
ETA: saw your followup about bonfires--bonfires on the beach are absolutely allowed. Just call your friends and tell them which beach you're all gathering at that evening. There are cans provided for the bonfire!
 
 
Another Seattle vote  
 
 
 Portsmouth, NH 
 
 
Redondo Beach!
It is a beach city in LA county south of the city.
Our winter temps are mid-60s most days. I can walk to the beach from my house. We are a short drive to any of the arts and culture offerings in Venice, LA (which -- little known fact -- actually has more small theatres than NYC), Long Beach, Santa Monica, etc. No one cares what we do for a living -- the jobs of people on my block range from lawyer to construction worker to hippy pot thrower to engineer. And I have no clue, nor do I care what any of them make. We are like one big extended family. I think I know more clothing labels than anyone I hang out with and that is only because I work at an art school with a huge fashion department so I have to know them. Flip flops are a mainstay in every wardrobe here. BF, ds and I have a basket of them near our front door because if it isn't a work/school day, that is all we wear. Add hat and tank to that... it is very beachy, casual here. People I live near, work with, etc. all hold doors, say please and thank you and such. And the only flags I see flying are American or related to football teams.
 
 
I always assumed the "close doors" elevator button was for the rare situations where the door stays open for an inordinately long amount of time. I didn't realize it was regularly used. Ha.
Ah, Louisiana. Where bigots will happily hold the door for you.
 
 
I would think a smaller setting, rather than a big city would make you happier.
I live in such a place in the Northern Midwest. Small state university town, a few blocks from on one of the Great Lakes, great recreational opportunities, biking, hiking, water sports, winter sports, hunting, fishing. People are friendly and don't care how you dress, what your job is or how much money you make. We have a great regional hospital and medical facilites and the schools are very good.
Negatives are it is rather isolated, short summers and shopping stinks. It is expensive to fly out of here and takes a day to drive to a major city, the area is not very diverse and good paying jobs are not plentiful. There are many underemployed PhDs.

Wait, what do you mean by cooler winters? Do you mean cold, lots of snow or mild winters? If cold/snow- Chicago/Madison/Minneapolis/St. Paul. Lots of know and cold temperatures there.
 
 
I'm LOLing at all the responses for places in FL and CA with a criteria of "cooler winters".
 
 
Vancouver, Canada.

Did you offer your seat while you watched the man swing from the pole? Just wondering.
 
 
I'll add more votes for Chicago, Milwaukee, Madison and the Fox Cities in WI. All lakes but still near water. All have tons of major music festivals and patronize the arts. The only thing is that I wouldn't say these aren't "cooler" winters - more like cold in the winter (well, not this year though!)
 
 
 
Did you offer your seat while you watched the man swing from the pole? Just wondering.

 

It seems to be implied that she was not sitting...
 
 
Wilmington, NC, you should try a long weekend there. It's a small city and there are rednecks out in the county, but you might like it.
 
 
You should start hanging out on the DC local board. We're mostly nice and don't care what you do for a living. And we have GTGs and happy hours. :)
 
 
Chicago is a major city that would fufill most of your criteria- but it can get very cold here in the winter!
 
 
I wanted to tell you what happened on my way home to help restore your faith in DC humanity.
I was scheduled to pick up some meat and eggs from a local farmer at 5:15. I arrived a few minutes early so I rested my bike against a tree and sat on the curb. During the ~5 minutes I was there two separate cyclists came by, stopped and asked me if everything was ok.
Once I picked up my delivery I had to bike home about 10 blocks. I had a 2 dozen eggs in my purse and was carrying about ten pounds of frozen meat in a bag in my hand, so I was a little bit unbalanced. On three separate occasions drivers ceded the right of way (in one case at an intersection where they had no stop sign) to allow me to continue home without losing momentum once they saw I had a heavy load and was struggling uphill. One of them rolled down the window and asked me where I got the meat and if the farmers were still there.
 
 
I'm sorry. DC is a tough city. I was miserable when I lived in the city. Now I'm way out in NOVA and spend all my time working, with DH and DS, or with a few close friends so it's OK but it still makes me sad that people are the way they are here.

No, I was standing. There are never seats when I ride the metro.

This is wonderful. I am not talking about DC people in a negative way. This week I have encountered a few bad eggs that have gotten under my skin. This is the first time in a year and a half that it got to me. Yes, this place is different from what I am used to, and I wish people would say thank you when you hold the door open, but it's not everyone. There are plenty of nice people, but unfortunately they are few and far between in my career.

I get it. I don't think anyone thinks you're saying everyone here is mean.
For some reason the metro seems to bring out the worst in people. On the rare occasion that I ride it I arrive to the office in a grouchy mood. Once I actually yelled at an entire car of people "when they say 'move to the center of the car', they're talking to you!" Not my finest moment :)
 
 
The west coast is generally less prestige oriented. You'd probably be happy in Seattle or PDX.
The people here are very nice, but not in a super "hey how are ya!!" kind of way.

Last night coming home, a lady was leaning onto the only pole I could reach. I was able to finally hold on once she moved an inch and then she moved back and leaned on my hand the whole time. I wanted to scream "you feel my hand, right? Stand up straight!"

ehh? I don't really tend to 'defend' Maine (I'm not a native) but honestly I've never NOT had a door held or anything like that here. I find people to be loud in general but not in a mean way.
Before I read any replies I was also going to say Portland, ME. Sounds like it fits your requirements to a T.
 
 
Frederick, MD. 60 miles out of DC. Meets all your qualifications if you count one big lake and one river as water. Tons of free or nominal fee activities/stuff for kids sponsored by the city. Artsy/hipster vibe downtown. Large restaurant district. Schools aren't stellar but they don't suck either and lots of private options. No one wants to talk about work that I've ever met.
 
 
Pittsburgh  aka the new Portland . Sorry, Portlandia.
