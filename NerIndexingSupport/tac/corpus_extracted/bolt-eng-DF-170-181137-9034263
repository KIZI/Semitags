  Me too. Go Sox!
 
 
Go cubs. first world championship in 101 years!!!

If the Sox are out and the Cubbies are still in it you got my full support, E!
 
 
What kind of interesting ways will the Mets find to blow it this year?

I'll support boston if the cubs are out. I hope the White Sox finish in last place.
 
 
Yeah the Cubs are one of those teams I can automatically get behind if the Phils are out. I'd love to see them win one.

For me, I'm worried about missing JC Romero for 50 games, and Hamels' injury has me worried too. But Howard and Utley are looking good, so that's a plus.

I'm pumped. Let's just wait for some games to talk about!

Not a big Ozzie Guillen fan?
 
 
I'm calling Reds and Giants as my two potential sleepers, leaning more towards the Giants. You can't overlook that rotation!

I lived in the Chicago area until I was 12. Back then, you liked one of Chicago's teams and hated the other one. so, I hate the white sox no matter who manages them. I would prolly like Guillen if he managed a different team>

Yeah, I like the Giants, too.

I also like Kansas City to surprise us a bit.
 
 
Is anyone gonna sign Barry Bonds? How long has he been off?

I doubt it. He didn't play an inning last year.

Nobody wants him. He'd wreck any club house's chemistry.

Plus he's like 44, a year removed from the game, and off the roids... I doubt he has anything left in the tank.
 
 
The three best teams in the AL could all be in the East, which means at least one is guaranteed to miss the playoffs.

I dunno, Mani, they got a heck of a young rotation, Crawford had a down year in 2008, Upton didn't catch on fire til the playoffs, and Longoria will only improve. The Rays are beastly.

Hillary Clinton curse.  
 
 
It smells like opening day!
 
 
Ah, the anual 'hate the Yanks' posts time are upon us.

The odd team out will be the Rays, their pitching is suspect and they are banged up.

NY's Pitching is the best i can remember it ever being, all five starters could or have been #1s in their careers.

Boston's pitching looks good, the potential weakness is long relif and is big popy & lowell through.

Jays and Baltimore will do their usual battle for the basement.

AL Central is a toss-up, so i will take the Twins, just because I have two twins in fantasy this year.

The west would be oipen with the Angel's pitching problems, except the rest of the teams their suck.

Over in the NL East, I look for the phils to repeat.

The Mets already managed to secure their screwup, they signed Shef.

The Cubbies should win the central, with the Cards getting that wild card.

In the NL West, manny leads the dodgers to another penant and first round elim.

So, play ball!
 
 
The Yankees have more to prove than anyone else in sports right now.

I don't think Girardi has what it takes to manage that roster.
 
 
I heard Dyke & Dyke make their predictions on espn radio this morning and they both picked the Sox to not make the playoffs.

What a couple of retarded douchebags!  
 
 
What are they basing that on?

2 best pitching staffs in baseball are NYY and Boston.

Neither is missing the playoffs.

Boston Red Sox 2009 World Champions. I like the way that sounds.

 

If the Red Sox can have the lowest average number of innings pitched per start in the MLB...they will be unstoppable.

On paper, their bullpen is extraordinary:

Papelbon
Okajima
Saito
Ramirez
Del Carmen
Masterson
Lopez

And best of all...no Timlin.

Yeah, our bullpen is going to be filthy. Don't forget at any time we can bring up Bard and his 100+ MPH stuff from AAA.

National sports radio likes to make bold predictions. They don't have a lot to lose to pick an unlikely event to occur, and they have a lot to gain (bragging rights) if that unlikely event actually occurs.

I agree. That Yankees have a pretty potent pitching staff on paper. But they have absolutely nothing between the starter and Rivera.

Their line up leaves something to be desired.

Granted the Red Sox have their question marks in the order but they are in a MUCH better position than the Skanks are to make a deal mid-season to pick up a bat.

Miggy Cabrera anyone?

NY has better options then you think.

Melky isn't a starter, isn't even the 4th OF anymore.

NY's only offensive worries are whether Posada and Godzilla are still productive, they are solid everywhere else.

We'll see how Gardner does.

Swisher is garbage.

And don't expect Nady to have another career year.

I like the kid, he hustles.

Nicky is a waste, NY picked him up as a 1B before tex was signed.

I have seen Nady play in NY for the mets, he's ok, 280 and 20HR is a reasonable expectation from him.
 
 
I still say the Rays are going to struggle this year.

It would certainly take a lot of pressure off us if you're right.
 
 
I believe the Ray's pitching is over rated.

I don't see them hanging in their this year.
 
 
 
The home opener postponed until tomorrow. This sucks.

 

Look on the bright side, at least they're already up a half game on the skankees, who got bitch slapped by the orioles. Sabathia got shelled.

I saw the box score and grinned.

Shades of last season for CC... I don't think most Skank fans will be very patient with him.

I can't wait for Burnetts first trip to the DL.

That's what everyone said in 2006, yet we still got to the WS. You never know with baseball.

Realistically though, I don't see us making the series again until we improve our pitching. Little chance of doing that while we are still eating huge $ for players (Gary Sheffield, Nate Robertson, Jeremy Bonderman, Dontrelle Willis, etc.) who are either not on the team or adding little to it.

Mike Ilitch has been more than generous but, by end of May, if the Tigers aren't competing I think we have to look at dismantling and rebuilding. You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.

From my head to my scrotum I am overwhelmed with anticipation for the home opener.

3 runs in already. But with 2 down and Tek at the plate, that'll probably be it.

Ayup...

But at least he doesn't look completely lost at the plate and is making solid contact.
 
 
Someone remind Ellsbury that leadoff hitters who start off every count 0-2 tend to get bumped from that spot... he's doing it again.

I don't think of it as the Phillies are digging themselves a hole as much as they are propping the Mets up higher on a termite-infested wooden ladder.

You guys are ahead again tonight and it looks like Bedard is pitching well.

Hopefully he doesn't pull his vagina this year and plays a full season.
 
 
Un-be-freakin-lievable!

The Tigers get 7 1/3 stellar innings of work from Edwin Jackson (1 run, 2 hits) and then Lyon, our presumptive 'closer', comes in and gives up a 3 run homer to put the Jays up 4-3 in the 8th. We tie it up in the top of the 9th, only to see Lyon implode again in the bottom of the inning with a BB, a single, a free pass and a walk-off sac fly to center.

Deja vu all over again and our bullpen - which we have known for the last 2 years was our achilles heel - has given up 7 ER in 5.2 IP.   28 blown saves last year, and we didn't have to wait long for the first one of '09. Lyon. Lions. Both crap.

Why I keep buying season tix to watch this steaming pile of poo I will never know.

Easier than last year, when the Tigers' so-called "Murderers Row" got murdered  

I get 4 tix, front row of the upper deck about halfway down the 3rd base line. Cost is just under $2k for which I get home opener, home closer, every Sunday home game and at least 1 midweek game for every homestand. 108 tickets in total, plus priority for playoff tix (an option that has been used once since the early 90's). Works out at about $17 a ticket - roughly 25% off the regular price.
 
 
I'm not worried about anything right now, personally. I'm never one to make excuses for millionaire professional sports players, but we do have a pretty crazy week with a lot of distractions. We had to deal with a day off right after our opener, and banner ceremonies, ring ceremonies, another day off, and a crowd that's bloodthirsty with higher expectations than probably ever before.

It'll be good to get all this chaos over with, enjoy the day off tomorrow, and get back to just focusing on baseball. I'm not one to make ex
 
 
Tigers win 5-1. Much better performance.

A lot of people were.   Pretty much the same lineup this year, minus Sheff (who was clubhouse poison). But pitching wins championships, and our BP could at very best be called a work in progress.

I have a feeling if things go south this season Miggy is going on the bloc.

I have a feeling that our rotation may be better than expected this year, if Verlander finds his game. Irrespective, our pen will still cost us at least 15 games this year if they perform as they did last year.
 
 
Damn it's been a long six months, but finally the day has arrived! Home opener against the Rangers!

Galarraga on the mound (our winningest starter last year).

Weather reasonably bright, but crisp. Better get the kids wrapped up warm.

Irrespective of how the result pans out and the absurd price of a beer and a dog, home openers are good.

Go Tigers!
 
 
Does anyone else have Dollar Dog nights at their stadium?
 
 
In NY?

I haven't seen a dollar hotdog since the late 1960s.

Not that I know of but the owners froze price increases on concessions at Fenway this year you hot dogs and beer costs will remain a steady 80 bagillion dollars a piece. Thanks goodness for small favors.
 
 
Wow that sucks, Hatfield does a promotion for the Phils several games a year where hot dogs are $1. They're not as big as a regular price hot dog, but a regular price hot dog at the game is like $4, so it's an awesome deal.

And the Phils haven't raised prices now for the past 2 seasons, at least, maybe more I can't remember. Beers have remained a steady $6.75.
 
 
 Fenway Concession Prices 

ETA: That's actually 2007 prices. They are all a bit higher than that now.

Just got back from the game. 15-2 Tigs win. Life is good. First time this week I looked forward to Sportscenter.

About the same at Comerica, Ball Park Franks are $3.50. Crackerjacks and Peanuts $4 each.

Ten years ago, you could get into the bleachers at old Tiger Stadium for $2.50, Labatts was $4.00 and a dog was $2. Could have a great day out for $20. Damn I'm old.
 
 
 
 
 
Damn it's been a long six months, but finally the day has arrived! Home opener against the Rangers!

Galarraga on the mound (our winningest starter last year).

Weather reasonably bright, but crisp. Better get the kids wrapped up warm.

Irrespective of how the result pans out and the absurd price of a beer and a dog, home openers are good.

Go Tigers!

 

Just got back from the game. 15-2 Tigs win. Life is good. First time this week I looked forward to Sportscenter.

 

Miguel Cabrera is a house of fire right now!

 

Miggy is da man!

Between him and Pujols in the NL one of them is going win a Triple Crown in the next few years.

Oh, man...

The Angels are letting all their emotions out right now and it's ugly.
 
 
Hunter is ejected. It looks like they threw out Scioscia, too. They might've tossed Speier, I'm not sure.

And now Youk and Drew have gone back to back.

 
 
 
Yep they tossed Speier and Mickey Hatcher, too.
 
 
Nice comeback by the Tigs today. A six run eighth giving them a 6-4 win for a 3 game sweep of Texas. Brandon Inge and the bullpen the heroes - whoda thunk it?

Over.500 for the first time this year, and leading the AL Central. Whoo-hoo!

Grats to the Tigers. They're a year late but I'm sure Detroit fans aren't complaining now.

The Central is going to be a fun division to watch this season.

Long way to go yet, but it might be a fun season. White Sox up next, which will tell us more about how good we are or aren't.

We couldn't go today (Easter Day lunch with the family) so we gave the tickets to my daughter's best friend and her family. They went but - get this - left at the top of the 8th because the Tigs were down 4-0 and showing no signs of life!!! Oh, how they must be kicking themselves!!!  

Looking forward to seeing the Angels game highlights on Sportscenter tonight - WTF happened???

There was a really late time call with Abreu at the plate, Beckett threw through it and the pitched buzzed Abreu's head.

Hunter, Speier, and Hatcher went completely berserk. I think they had a ton of pent up emotion and it was the little spark they needed to let it fly.

I've been there before, I could tell they were seeing red.

Yeah - I saw it. It didn't look like there was anything bubbling under between the teams before that, and there didn't seem to be anything malicious in the pitch - just one that got away.

Torre is a good PR guy, he was ok on teh field when Don Zimmer made the baseball moves, but after Zim was fired you could see Torre was clueless.

Yeah, great game. We were terrible hitting into four double playing in the first 5 innings and squandering a bunch of chances. I'm glad the Skanks coughed this one up. We kinda own Rivera.

okay i am an a's fan...i like jason giambi fan...much to the disdain of my husband..but here goes:

his rant:

the yankess has more to prove than any other team in ALL of sports history due to their over paid players who have the all time historical payroll in the history of all sports. (i am not providing links to back up this rant at all)

plus they tore down one of the most historical venues in all of sports history...the house that ruth built..they suck...(he is not scratching..doing that man thang) they will be beaten by teams with 10% of their payroll..due to their lack of HEART, they are simply too rich, so they have plenty of heart they just have nothing to pay for...too much money..its just bullshit...10 or 12 yrs w/o winning the series and ever year they spend more and more money, its just nuts.

yankess will not make the playoffs...mans says "i can throw the ball as hard as johnnie daymon, you can put that in there too"

he has now stormed out in total disgust....due to me saying i liked giambi...he comments "why, he can't hit or run?"

but there is our prediction...no playoffs for the yankees...and never underestimate the braves
 
 
omg he is back and ranting..about daymon...millions of dollars how cant play defense...he could play for the red sox cause their center field was short but they still got shed of him...cut his hair to...man is now making that mocking voice "played with the yankees and cut his hair"...o this is funny...he is walking down the hall going they could have got robinson cano but no they got daymon...i am not sure of these spellings....lol..thanks guys now he is in a total fucking hating yankees rant i have seem them go on for days lol.....
 
 
" sebastain doesnt seem to have a fast ball this year" i cant keep up any longer....they have him 100 mill a year highest paid pitcher in the league...now they are saying he never has a good april anyway..maybe that is not it.? not having a fast ball in april makes no sense...

o how funny...he would stop and be quiet and do something then come back and just start again...he is now out in bees..whew
 
 
i got perhaps 1/2 of his rant down....he will rant the rest of the day...i mean he gets pissed talking about the yankees...

I wouldn't say kind of, I would say completly.

I saw it coming too, Giradi paniced by putting Mo in with two out in the 8th, Rivera has said for some time he loses speed on his fastball when he has to sit between innings.

As soon as Bay hit it, i knew it was gone too.
 
 
Tigs totally dominated last night by the Royals and the increasingly impressive Zack Greinke. Royals win 6-1, and I'm gonna start a thread about Greinke. He is quite possibly gonna be he story of the year.  
 
 
BTW, the original Yankee stadium has not been torn down, it's still there, as a museum to baseball.
 
 
tell ya what xen you can call tonight and tell him that...me i am glad i am hauling trash today and trying to help him from being overwhelmed with yankee hate
 
 
I'm used to people hating them, it's no big deal to me.

When I was a kid, they always lost, it wasn't till I was 15 that I saw them win a world series, I spent my childhood hearing about Tom seaver and the mets, while the Yankees just sucked.

Then they won 2 World series, and didn't win again for 18 years.

So when people bitch about NY buying this or that, i laugh, all that money spent and i have onlt seen 6 titles in nearly 50 years.

George should ask for his money back.  
 
 
Tigs hang on for a tight 3-2 win over the Royals.

2 of 3 from the M's.
1 of 3 from the Angels.
2 of 3 from the Royals.

5 and 4 is a successful road trip. C'mon home home boys!

Yo, Bob, what's your take on Armando Galarraga?

 

Well, we all love him in Detroit but let's face it the Tigers were tough to love last year and he was one of the few bright spots.

I believe he's got real potential but it worried me at the start of the season that he was going to come under a huge amount of pressure from expectation, both from fans, the local media and the fantasy pundits.

He was a complete surprise to us all last year. We got him for next to nothing (as I recall he was traded for a Single or Double A player) and it was only Dontrelle Willis' injury that brought him up to the Tigers. I happened to be at his first game against the Tribe last April. Everyone was kind of looking at each other, thinking of our dismal start to the 2008 campaign, and saying to each other "Oh crap, who the hell is this guy, is this the best we've got?" None of us were saying that by September.

He's not overpowering but has wicked movement, good location, and seems at present to have the mental strength needed to succeed. The fact that the Tigers rotation seems at least early in the season to be stronger that many expected (Verlander's poor start notwithstanding) can only help him. Amazingly to many Tiger fans the bullpen looks solid as well at present. We're all holding our breath right now and wondering if this is a flash in the pan or whether all we needed was some self belief.

I'd like to see him throw more ground ball outs, and a lot of teams don't know him that well yet so better scouting may reveal weaknesses, but the year has started positively. If he stays healthy (and the bullpen doesn't revert to the form of the last 3 years), I wouldn't be surprised to see him as a 15+ game winner this year.

If Verlander can get his shit together then our 1-2-3 with him, Galarraga and Jackson could make us contenders. Mind you, Justin pitches against the Yanks and Sabathia tomorrow night so.....we'll see!
 
 
Thanks, Bob!

I'm trying to decide if he's a sell high candidate or not.
 
 
 
 
 
can't believe how hot the mariners are right now, number one in the A.L. West. I hope they keep it up. I guess Griffey is good for them, people can say whatever about him but he seems to be good for morale.

I've always liked Griffey and yes the M's are better than expected. This season is bringing plenty of surprises so far!
 
 
 
 

 

Congrats and, as the Yanks will have arrived here overnight, thanks for putting a severe dent in the confidence of their bullpen.

Tigers 4 Yanks 2. Tigs 3 games over.500 at the top of the AL Central  

Closer is still potentially an issue though.

NY finally wins behind Phil Huges as they shut out the Tigers 11-0

 

Ugh! That was such a depressing 7th inning. 0-0 at the start of the inning, 10-0 at the end of it. And all because Anderson misjudged a fly ball.  

At very least we should have had one out (F7), and with Josh's arm I'm fairly sure the guy tagging at 3rd would have been out at the plate. As it was, 8 of the 10 runs are unearned. But I can't blame Anderson for everything. Our bullpen finally had its long anticipated implosion.

Hughes, BTW, was superb, as was Ed Jackson. Shame to see two really good quality starts remembered more for that disaster in the 7th.

I'm at the game tonight. It will be interesting to see what happens. Porcello goes for the Tigers (he's looked OK so far, but this is his first start at Comerica and playing the Yanks is always a big deal), with Joba starting for NY (I'm surprised he's not back in the bullpen by now, and he's started to walk a lot of batters, possibly due to throwing more breaking balls than when he worked in relief).

My daughter got a ball from Andy P and Joba's autograph last time we saw the Yanks. Think I'll go early for BP.
 
 
 
I'm used to people hating them, it's no big deal to me.

George should ask for his money back.  

 

What George should do is keep his nose out of management. You know, if you're going to gamble your money, it's a bit tacky to whine about losing your money.

Georgie is old and senile and has not interfeared with team for over a decade.

Joba is a starter according to Cashman, they won't bullpen him, which is dumb, he is great at that, average as a starter.
 
 
NY holds on 8-6, excellent start for Joba, horrible bull pen again.

Pen whoas are becoming a real worry, Mo gave up a 3 run shot, not good.

Ooooh, that was tough to watch. Another one big inning seals the Tigers fate.

Joba looked in trouble early on but got out of it. Then I looked at the scoreboard in the middle of the 6th or so and he'd thrown as many balls as he had strikes - 30 of each! The 5th and 6th instead of making him throw strikes we were swinging at anything. Tigers faced 10 pitches in the 5th and 6th inning combined! We came back in the 9th but it was too little too late and in all honesty if we'd won after batting that poorly it would have been an injustice.

Hats off to the Yanks, They took their chances, while the Tigers didn't.
 
 
Joba has been batling his control since they made him a starter.

He tends to become addicted to breaking balls and he misses a lot with them.

On the other hand, the Red Wings went 1-0 in their series against the Ducks tonight, scoring the winner in the last minute. Whoo-hoo!!!
 
 
Welp, I'm pissed. Today was my first game this season, against the Mets no less, and it's rained out. Had these tickets for 2 and a half months just DYING to go, and who the hell knows when it'll be rescheduled. Probably to a day game during the week when I can't make it  
 
 
NY's win steak is finally over, CC pitches bad again.

If it isn't rained out, Hughes will try for his second win.

NY was rained out, no baseball on a sunday, mega boring.
 
 
Sorry to hear that Xeno and Paulie. By contrast, today was a perfect day (68 degrees, bright blue skies) at the ballpark in downtown Motown.

To start with, my son got to go on the field about 10 minutes before the first pitch and have his photo taken with his Little League team. (That's him in the front row, 2nd from left).

To make it ever better, the Tigs are back on track and so is Verlander. 7 IP, 2 H, 1, ER, 11 K's and the bullpen holds the 3-1 lead. Verlander's fanned 20 in his last 2 starts.

Life has been good today.

 
 
 
Oh, actually, the Wings lost in triple OT but I suppose you can't have everything.
 
 
What a difference a day makes. Tigers blank the Twins 9-0 behind 7 strong innings of 4 hit ball from rookie Rick Porcello.   We're in the middle of a critical 13 game stretch against AL Central rivals. 2 game set at the ChiSox coming up before we travel to Cleveland for 3 at the weekend.

We're 14-12, one game out of first behind the surprising Royals.

Go Tigers!

are the royals the rays of '09?

red sox are up 6-3 in the 8th

 
 
 
How many called 3rd strikes are we going to have in this game?

sox win. 7-3.
 
 
Man, I'd love to see a Phils/Sox WS.

I didn't want you guys last year because I knew we could beat TB, but I wasn't sure about Boston. This year though, I'd welcome it because I could handle a loss now that I got a WS.

The way things are looking, that might be a possibility too. Our rotation is finally starting to come around, and our bats right now are just crazy.

How about friggin Raul Ibanez??? Dude's dusting off his shelf and making room for a certain incoming trophy  
 
 
I am going to say again, man I am glad Griffey is back in Seattle. Mariners still lead in the west but I feel it is too early for them to be doing this well. No one even thought they would be contenders this year. We will see!
 
 
Tigers bounced 6-0 by the White Sox last night. Buehrle was perfect until the 7th. Tigs now travel for Cleveland for 3, but if we can't beat the Sox we won't win the central.

BTW, Dontrelle Willis looks like he'll start for the Tigers on Wednesday.  
 
 
Gayrod returns and hits a 3 run bomb on the first pitch he sees.
 
 
Cubs are only 2.5 games back toward their march to be World Series Champs 2009~
 
 
Picture this if you will...

Verlander for Detroit, Lee for Cleveland. A pitching duel. The only run of the game given up by Lee in the 8th because Clete Thomas hustles to leg out an infield single.

Verlander comes out to pitch the 9th. He's thrown a gem. 0 R, 2 H, 1BB, 10 Ks. About 110 pitches but he's still throwing 98mph. He walks Valbuena to start the inning. Shoppach comes to the plate, representing the winning run. Shoppach lays down a sac bunt that Verlander fields and throws to 2nd to retire Valbuena.

Sizemore now comes to the plate. He hammers a pitch over the wall in right center...where Curtis Granderson leaps and pulls it back!

Verlander K's Cabrera, Tigers win 1-0.

That was one hell of a game. You gotta feel sorry for Lee. 22 wins last year, but 1-5 this year because the Tribe can't give him any run support. But still, hats off to Justin. First shutout since his no hitter in '97.

Awesome game, and well worth staying up for Baseball Tonight.

Back to back Tigerbob posts, back to back Tiger shutouts. Tigs win 4-0 in cleveland on 7 strong innings from Ed Jackson, hold for Zumaya and save for Rodney (7/7).
 
 
Six straight wins gives the Mets a half game lead.
 
 
Tigers win 5-3 at the Tribe, despite Rodney looking decidedly average for the second straight appearance. Actually, average probably overrates today's near catastrophe.

Still, 3 out of 3 away to a divisional rival is a great result.  

 

Off day tomorrow then 3 at the Twins before the boys come for a 9 game home stand starting Friday.

4 games over.500 now, one game out of first. Whoo-hoo!
 
 
NY beats the Orange birds 2 out 3, but the team is still under performing.
 
 
NY on the way to a sweep of the Twins after another late inning comeback.

Bullpen is still to inconsistant at this point, starters coming on however.
 
 
Big Papi has been sat down, I think he will struggle without Manny in the line-up?
 
 
I think he's struggling without an injection in his butt.
 
 
could be true, I don't know why they use that crap but I guess it makes them super strong, the side effects are not worth it in MHO
 
 
Well, the difference between average player and superstar is something like 10 million per yer, and ball players usually only last 5 years.

So taking the chance means a possible net gain of 50 million dollars.

Risk your health for the chance to be set up for life, a lot of people would take that deal.
 
 
5 in a row, and third straight walk off win for NY.

Twins sure are the cure for what ails the Yankees.
 
 
 
Big Papi has been sat down, I think he will struggle without Manny in the line-up?

 

Bay and Youk don't quite provide Manny-esque protection but they are pretty damn close.

Besides, if you project his number's last season to a full one minus injury David's production was a-okay.

Ortiz' problem is age and prolly a lack of steroids. Guy's like David don't decline slowly, they dive off a cliff.

He needs to be moved down in the order. Youk and Bay should be the 3/4 hitters in either order now. Papi should be hitting 5th or lower. Let's see if the Tito finally gives in the obvious and moves him out of the 3 slot.
 
 
Managers can be thick some times.

After mattingly's back went, the dopey NY managers kept batting him third, no matter how bad he stunk it up.

Francona is probaly smarter then that, at least you guys better hope so.
 
 
Went to game 3 of the Tigers / A's series today. Tigers sweep.

Gotta be tough being an A's fan right now. They scored 5 runs in the first inning today, and 4 runs in the other 26 innings of the series. By comparison, the Tigers racked up 34 runs over the 3 games.

It's been feast or famine with the Tigers lately. We've swept the A's (34 runs to 9) and the Tribe (10-3), and got swept by the Twins (26-17).

Willis gets his 2nd start Tuesday, and Bonderman's first rehab start Saturday at Single-A West Michigan looked good (7 IP, 6 H, 2 ER, 1 BB, 94 pitches). If Carlos Guillen comes back from the DL healthy and Magglio's batting continues to strengthen (he's on bereavement leave until about Thursday) the Tigers are looking like they could be in with a shot this year.

Rangers and Rockies are in town next, then we visit the Royals. Our biggest challenge will be to prove we can beat our key divisional rivals, against whom we are 9-8 this year but 5 of those wins were against the Tribe (who are struggling since they hired our old pitching coach!) As it is right now we are on top of the AL Central, 1 game and 3 games up on KC and the Twinkies respectively.

I was always small framed, at 29 years old I weigh 175. That's big enough to play in the majors. I was tiny growing up. I always batted lead off because I was fast and I could work a count. I'd crouch low and work just as many walks as hits.

In baseball, there's a ROLE for the small guy. What it all comes down to though, is chicks dig the long ball.

Oriz has 10-5 status and is signed thru next season at like 11 mil. His value is in the toilet already.
 
 
Unless he shows he has anything left, Ortiz is going nowhere.

The fact he doesn't play the field really deminishes what value he has left, if was decent at first you might be able to dump him.

LOS ANGELES -- If Ryan Church thought he was in Jerry Manuel's doghouse before, just wait.

It's only going to get worse after what happened here last night.

In a 2-2 game, Church missed third base while scoring what would have been the go-ahead run in the 11th inning, providing the most monumental of many Met blunders that set up a crushing, 3-2 loss the Dodgers later that inning.

Please, join me in discussing our national pastime here throughout the season.

I'll get started.

Boston Red Sox 2009 World Champions. I like the way that sounds.

 

  Me too. Go Sox!

 

 
 
 
Go cubs. first world championship in 101 years!!!  

 

If the Sox are out and the Cubbies are still in it you got my full support, E!

 

I'll support boston if the cubs are out. I hope the White Sox finish in last place.

 

Red Sox woo hooo
 
 
 
 
 
I like first place.

 

Me too.

2 of 3 from the Yanks in their home ain't too shabby.

I'm a little worried about Lidge though.

 

And we thank you for it.

Srsly... what's up with Lidge?

 

From what I've seen, nothing is really "up" with him. He's making good pitches, but hitters are being way more patient and waiting for their pitch.

Everyone knows he doesn't throw the slider for a strike, so you wait until you see a ball in the zone and maybe this season hitters are just getting a little luckier and guessing right that it's the fastball.

When I say I'm worried about him, I just mean I'm worried that maybe hitters have figured him out. It's certainly not like he's hanging the slider, I haven't seen that YET. A-rod's homer the other day was a slider low in the zone that he just got enough of.

The same thing is sorta happening to Papelbon recently. A lot of hitters seem to be jumping on his first pitch fastball which is almost always in the zone. He has also given up bombs in his last two appearances and already has more walks issued than all of last season.

It happens from time to time. You almost have to reinvent yourself, otherwise big league hitters are inevitably going to adjust. That's why they're in the big leagues, afterall.

Maybe Lidge should learn a changeup, that would definitely be a huge asset. Papelbon has one, right?

True with the exception of Mariano Rivera who seems to have been doing it with one pitch all along.

Paps doesn't really feature a change up.

That cutter is something damn special, though. It's the latest breaking pitch I've ever seen, and I've never seen anyone else throw one that does anything close to what Mo's does. You can't blame the ones who've been made to look stupid all these years.
 
 
pedro in his prime had the best changeup i've ever seen.

Pedro made the best hitters the world that steroids could produce look like fools at the plate because of that changeup.
 
 
Mo's cutter has been his bread and butter, but his real secret is he's always thrown strikes.

Even the cut fastball is usually in the zone, walks and being behind is why pitchers fail.

no shit. he nibbles WAY too much.
 
 
He's not alone.

It's Joba's #1 fault, he gets ahead 0-2, and it's three breaking pitches off the zone, and 100 pitches by the fifth inning.

DAMN annoying.

sometimes they think too much.

they don't get paid to think.  
 
 
99 times out of 100 a hitter expects a breaking ball when down 0-2.

Forget about the curve ball Ricky, give em the heater!
 
 
Hughes is starting to figure that out, he was getting the Rangers all day yesterday with 0-2 heat.
 
 
Lester allows another big inning, kills my fantasty team.
 
 
Believe it or not, it's raining in Texas and the yankee game is delayed.
 
 
Bollocks.

We cruised the first game against KC (Verlander is on fire at present), but last night ran into Zack Greinke again. At least the one run we scored against him was earned this time, but he is hugely impressive. Every time he got in trouble he somehow induced a DP.

The rubber game is today. Our 20 year old rookie Rick Porcello (5-3, 3.55 ERA) is going for his 4th straight win. In the previous 3 he's given up 1 run or less. If he does it again, he'll be the first pitcher that young to do it since Fernando Valenzuela's rookie year in 1981. Of course, Fernando did it seven times in a row!

I came here to ask people outside of Detroit if they realize how good our team is yet. This team could go all the way. Sad we didn't a couple years ago. Seemed like we were destined to do it then too. I think we didn't have enough good pitchers. Is it me, or does it seem like we got a lot of good pitchers this year?

We had a lot of good pitchers back then too. I remember 8 of these guys. I only know 7 of the guys names from this year, so far anyways.
 
 
What a difference a year makes.

Detroit Tigers..........RECORD.........ERA.........SHO.......... WHIP..........WIN RANK #..........SV..........BSV..........SV%
2008 season.............74-88..........4.91............0.............1.51..................12.................34...........28..............55
2009 to date.............25-19..........3.88............6.............1.33...................5..................9............5..............64

Cleveland Indians.....RECORD........ERA.........SHO..........WHIP..........WIN RANK #...........SV..........BSV............SV%
2008 season.............81-81..........4.45............5............1.37.....................8................31............20..............61
2009 to date.............19-28..........5.49............1............1.56....................13...............10.............9...............53

I know Cleveland has had several changes to their pitching staff, but the biggest difference I see is that the Tigers got a new pitching coach (Rick Knapp) during the offseason and their old coach (Chuck Hernandez) went to.....CLEVELAND!      
 
 
As predicted Joba was near 100 pitches in the 4th and never made it to the fifth as NY falls to Texas 7-3.

He's got an advanced case of Kazmiridus.
 
 
The sports talkers in NY are apeshit to get him back in the pen and Wang back in teh rotation.

I always thought making him a starter was a mistake, but Hank Steiny ordered it and cashman is too much a pussy to change it.

The sooner the Yankees come to the conclusion that he's their future closer the better (for them, I of course hope they continue to suck at handling pretty much every aspect of management).
 
 
Management is unlikely to change much.

Making this guy a starter was a mistake from the start, and now it looks like pride is preventing them from admitting it.

NY might have a 3 or 4 game lead on the socks had Joba been there in the 8th closing down teams instead of stinking it up as a starter.

Your main problem is letting your front office make those kinds of decisions.

Why have a manager? What the fuck DOES Girardi do, if not decide who's in the rotation and who's in the pen?

Does Hank write the line-up card too, and hand it to Giardi in the clubhouse before the game?
 
 
Obviously you have been in a baseball cave the last 4 decades.

That has ALWAYS the way NY has been run since the steinys bought the team.
 
 
NY takes 2 of 3 from texas with an 9-2 win.

Wang looked great out of the pen and appears to have his sinker back.

NY and Beantown now tied for first with identical records.
 
 
Neck and neck... just how I like it... for now.

I can't wait until Ortiz gets "injured" so Theo can make a BIG move before the deadline with the massive stack of chips he has in front of hime to play with. This team is geared to win now, he better not blow this opportunity.
 
 
Big Crappy looks pretty lame these days.

Firstly, way to go Wings!  

Tigers take 2 of 3 at KC and are now in Baltimore for 4 games before coming home to face the Red Sox Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. I've got tix for the Thursday game.

AL Top 5 Win %

Texas.587
Detroit.578
Red Sox.574
NYY.574
Toronto.540

Looking likely Wild Card will come from East. But there's a long way to go....

What's with the Blue Jays??? Daaamn!

The majority of the post was sarcasm. The Girardi reference was just for the sake of current events.

Seriously though, why have a manager? Why not just let the FO call the playsfrom the booth like a friggin football game?

I'd say it's a waste of money, but it's the Yankees. That would be like saying water is wet.

6 WS wins and 10 WS appreances in that time.

Anybody else close?
 
 
NY takes sole possesion of 1st for the first time since the final day of the 2006 season by beating cleveland 3-1.

Great bullpen work, 4 innings of 2 hit shutout ball.
 
 
NY continues to roll as it again defeats the Indians on their home turf.

The win, combined with another beantown loss increases teh Yank's leasd to 1 1/2 games.
 
 
Aye. The Sox are skidding a bit.
 
 
Big Crappy is getting worse, another ofer wiff of a day.

I see Smoltz may be ready next month.
 
 
Yep. If we can get 100 good innings from him I'll be satisfied.

I think Papi needs to get "injured" to make room so we can make a move for a big bat to solidify the lineup.

I get that, and that's all well and good, so why bother complaining when the FO decides the rotation and bullpen?

You win some, you lose some, right?

Since Joba's not working out well, we'll sell you Chan Ho Park on the cheap

Y'all need to take Brad Penny off the Sox fans first.
 
 
Joba found the cure for Kazmiridus tonight.
 
 
Yo, Bob, the big series starts tonight!
 
 
 
Yo, Bob, the big series starts tonight!

 

Yep. Should be a good one. Based on starting pitching so far, I think.....

We have the advantage tonight (Dice has looked shaky so far, Porcello very impressive).

You have the advantage Wednesday (Gala has struggled recently, while Beckett has impressed).

The rubber game Thursday (for which I have tix   ) depends on which pitcher shows up ('Late Movement Willis' or 'Hanging Over the Plate Willis' vs. 'Good Control Wakefield' or 'Walks and Hit Batters Wakefield').

Either way, it's just one series on a long road, but will be a gauge of how good we are or are not. Our season will not be decided until September. I've just noticed that we end the regular season playing 19 straight divisional games!
 
 
Joba ate a bug and pitched 8 last night, as NY took 3 of 4 against the tribe at the Jake (fuck the corporate name).

Time for Texas at home tonight as AJ goes for the pinstripes.

I still call it the Jake too. And I still refer to Tiger Stadium more often than CoPa.
 
 
I loathe the corporate names, the Mets are a laughing stock, they play at 'citifield' named for federally bailedout Citibank.

At least the Yankees play at Yankee Stadium, and the Football giants play at Giants stadium, as it should be.

Actually, Maggs just came to the end of a 16 game hitting streak at the weekend, but something's definitely not right with him at present.

I was at my son's little league game last night and then watching the Wings/Pengs game, but I saw Papelbon's 9th. Doubt he'll be available to pitch tonight. What was it, 35 pitches?

First game to you guys.

Thus far the "gauge" is leaning towards 'not'. Actually, "leaning" is probably underselling it. Falling over might be better.

I'm heading down to the game early today. Watch BP from 11.30 - 12.30 and see if I can shag a fly ball, then I'll wander over to the pen and watch Wakefield warm up. Not often one gets the chance to see a knuckleballer up close.

Apart from a brief period of sound and fury late yesterday we've been pretty tame so far (though that said, Beckett was masterly yesterday   ).
 
 
NY falls to Texas as Andy has a bad day, his back may be worse then suspected.

Wang tonight, Hughes out of teh rotation.

Yesterday's game was weird.
All runs scored in two half innings Dontrelle pitches great for the first two then in the 3rd walks the first 2, strikes out the 3rd, then walks the next three (including 2 runs) before getting the hook. Cabrera injures his hammy and leaves the game Reliever Zach Miner leaves the game with leg cramp Leyland gets ejected for arguing balls and strikes, presumably to make Willis feel better about pitching a crap game The umps all have to leave the field to video review a potential home run (first time I've ever seen that live) When he was yanked, Willis was still actually throwing a no hitter (unless you include hitting a batter) At one point, Boston had scored 5 runs on 1 hit.
Irrespective of all these notables, it doesn't change the fact that we just got swept at home. Bugger.

Hats off to Boston.  
 
 
And the Red Wings lost. Double bugger.

On the other hand, my 9 year old went 3 for 4 in Little League, scored 2 and knocked in 2, and caught his first fly ball in center field. Pretty good catch too, over his head and moving to the left, holding runners at 2nd and 3rd and preserving a 3 run lead in the bottom of the last. Won 8-5. Well done Tom!  

So, not an entirely crap day!
 
 
Wang stinks it up, but NY still rolls 8-6 over texas.

Rays are next up.
 
 
It's feast or famine with Lidge this year, it's killing me. We're getting stellar pitching from our rotation now and SHOULD be going strong with 10 in a row, but then there's Lidge.

Sunday Night Baseball tonight on ESPN, our rookie Bastardo vs. our ex-starter Randy Wolf. Bastardo looked good in his debut the other night, hopefully he can keep it going.
 
 
 
And the Red Wings lost. Double bugger.

On the other hand, my 9 year old went 3 for 4 in Little League, scored 2 and knocked in 2, and caught his first fly ball in center field. Pretty good catch too, over his head and moving to the left, holding runners at 2nd and 3rd and preserving a 3 run lead in the bottom of the last. Won 8-5. Well done Tom!  

So, not an entirely crap day!

 

Great news about your 9 year old. The best thing I can say is not to boost his ego or he will be like you and me watching sports in our forties. Fred Lynn's dad liked to throw knock down pitches at his kid. If you do this, don't throw too hard. Take care.
 
 
NY has another comback as an 8th inning error prolongs the Yankee at bat and allows the tieing run to score.

This, combined with a Rangers win propels NY back into first.

The only thing I ask of him it that when he's playing he pays attention. A kid who doesn't keep his eye on the ball is gonna get beaned. Other than that, so long as he's enjoying himself, it's all good.
 
 
Clete Thomas hits his first career slam in the 8th as the Tigers rebound from the depressing sweep by Boston to take 2 of 3 from the halos.
 
 
NY wins behind Pettit and lots of long ball 5-3, takiing 2 of 3 off Tampa.

Yankees now have best record in AL.
