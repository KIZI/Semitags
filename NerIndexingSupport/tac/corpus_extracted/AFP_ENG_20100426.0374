Poland's conservative opposition leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski will run for
president in a June 20 snap election called after his brother died in an air
crash in Russia, he said Monday.

"Poland is our common, great responsibility. It demands that we overcome
personal suffering to take action despite a personal tragedy. This is why I have
taken the decision to be a candidate for the office of president of the Republic
of Poland," Kaczynski said in a statement on the website of his Law and Justice
party.
