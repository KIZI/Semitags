European Union Industry Commissioner Guenter Verheugen will meet next Monday
with EU economy ministers and representatives from General Motors to discuss the
future of GM unit Opel, a German newspaper reported.

"The (EU executive) commission is strictly opposed to a race for subsidies" to
finance the restructuring of GM's European unit, which employs around 50,000
people in several European countries, including Germany, Britain, Spain and
Poland, he told the Rheinische Post in an interview to appear in its Wednesday
edition.

"We need a European solution based strictly on economic criteria," he said.

The newly named head of GM Europe Nick Reilly is expected to attend the session.

General Motors jolted the European auto sector earlier this month when it
scrapped a decision to sell German-based Opel and said it would hold on to and
restructure the unit itself.

Germany had backed the planned sale to Canadian auto parts maker Magna
International and Russian state bank Sberbank and offered several billion euros
in aid to support the transaction.

The German government could now decide to assist Opel through a fund created to
help companies hit by the global economic crisis.

Verheugen said such an approach was possible but would have to adhere to "strict
conditions."
