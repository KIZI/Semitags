Russian mining company MMC Norilsk Nickel is selling its majority ownership stake in Montana's Stillwater Mining Company.

Norilsk announced the sale Monday, saying it wanted to focus on its "core operations" in the global mining and metals industry. The company said its $257 million initial investment in Stillwater had generated value for the parent company's shareholders, fulfilling a strategic objective.

Stillwater's two mines in the Beartooth Mountains southwest of Billings produced 529,900 ounces of palladium and platinum last year -- the only raw source of the metals in the U.S.

Company spokesman Dan Gagnier says Monday's news will not impact Stillwater's plans to expand its Montana mines and develop another in Ontario, Canada.
