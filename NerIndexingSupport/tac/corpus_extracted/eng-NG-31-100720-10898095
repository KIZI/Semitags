This election: socialism vs capitalism

It didn't surprise me that the same Democrats that demanded and
celebrated Government intervention to stop the collapse of home loan
companies (by way of government takeover) would reject the same
government intervening to support the markets in the country.   Why?
It is becoming ever clearer that this is an election of socialism vs
capitalism.  Everywhere you see something that will benefit companies
and corporations, McCain is for it and Obama against it.  When you see
some kind of socialist government proposal...like governmental
healthcare...you find Obama for it and McCain against it.

Just take a few seconds to let it marinate, and you will see what I am
saying is true.  Almost EVERY proposal of Obama leads to greater
governmental growth and fulfills a socialist desire n
(support for unions, universal healthcare, government takeover of
humanitarian work, etc).  The things he attacks are almost all
capitalist (those dirty big corporations...those fuel
companies....those HMOs...etc).  Meanwhile, almost everything McCain
proposes leads to less government and more capitalist freedom and
growth.  The things he attacks about Obama is almost always some
socialist proposal.

This is East vs West in our very country in this election.

couldn't care less about their neighbors, live in castles

Capitalism vs Socialism is a very simplistic view of the issues.  Take
Health care - did you know that the USA pays the highest per Capita in
the world on its privately run health care or over 15% of GDP compared
to about 9% for the rest of the OECD?  Yet 50 million Americans are
not covered by health insurance and the quality of care is no better
than anywhere else in the world.

And what has happened to the lazy faire system of government
regulation that Bush has supported?  America's financial system is
almost bankrupted by greedy incompetent Corporate CEO's and the
taxpayer will foot the bill.  Government has an important role to play
unless you believe the great depression was good for the country.

And repuglicons are the socialists.

In the last couple of months the federal government has, either directly or
indirectly, taken over 70% of the mortgage funding in the US, now owns 79.9%
of the largest insurance company in the world, owns a piece of several
investment banks, and now is talking about buying off a portion of more
companies. This will put taxpayers on  he hook for about a trillion, yes,
that's with a "t", dollars.

There are so many lies in that paragraph, that it isn't worth the

Just to remind you - in the last week, appointees of the Bushwhack
administration committed the Federal government to take ownership of
80% of AIG, an enormous insurance corporation.  This is the largest
single "socialist" act that the US government has ever taken,
socialism being defined in terms of the government taking ownership of
private property for the public good.

 

Yeah.  Look where that got us.

Less government, means more private greedsters abusing common sense in
order to MAKE MONEY FASTER!!!

George Soros is obviously smarter than Kennie.

 

He's just the President, and therefore the leader of the party that
McCain was nominated by.  And he most certainly is not a Democrat, and
your post accused the Democrats of what Bush's government actually
did.

 

McCain has said all sorts of things this week, most of which
contradict other things he has said this week.  You ignored this, that
I quoted earlier this week:
< http://thinkprogress.org/wonkroom/2008/09/16/mccain-regulation-2/
<<Here is a look at McCain’s back-and-forth on regulation during the last 24 hours:
<<- Deregulation: McCain issued a statement Monday morning saying that
<< “we cannot tolerate a system that handicaps our markets and our
<< banks.”
<<
<<- Regulation: McCain’s campaign then put out an ad calling for
<< “tougher rules on Wall Street.”
<<
<<- Deregulation: This morning, on NBC’s Today Show, McCain said, “Of
<< course, I don’t like excessive and unnecessary government
<< regulation.”
<<
<<- Regulation: Then, on CBS’s The Early Show, McCain said, “Do I
<< believe in excess government regulation? Yes.”
<<
<<- Both: On CNBC’s Squawk Box, McCain said, “We don’t want to burden
<< average citizens with over-regulation and government bureaucracy…And
<< I’m proud to be a Teddy Roosevelt Republican, who said, ‘unfettered
<< capitalism leads to corruption,’ and we’ve got to fix this.”

 

As did most of the world.

 

Which of course is inevitably the case, since the kinds of laws that
are needed will require the full time attention of Congresscritters
that are busily trying to get reelected.

Common sense recognition of practical reality is a plus for Obama.

 

liar.

 

I'll even ask for a cite to their legal conviction, since you've
repeated this claim.  I suspect that it is another lie.  I think they
both face fines for civil liability, but that does not mean that they
are "guilty".

 

No it didn't, clueless.  It took over an insurance company.  And it
was a Republican government that did so.

 

The Republican version thereof, perhaps.

Government *regulation*.  Something McCain approves of, except when he
doesn't, but what might have prevented the idiocy that went on this
week (at least the idiocy on Wall Street.  The idiocy YOU post on
Usenet cannot be blamed on the government.)

 

It is not socialism.

 

A mortgage-holder is not an owner until after foreclosure.

No it is not socialist.

Taking over AIG is arguably a socialist step - taken by the Bush
administration that McCain would be the third term of.

 

Russia and China are both claimed to be capitalist now, even though
the state owns many of the largest industries in each country.

The difference between socialists and Republicans: socialists want to
distribute wealth and resources to the many and Republicans want to
distribute wealth and resources to the few.  Welfare for the many or
welfare for the few.  By the way, the government spends a lot more
money bailing out and financing corporations than the citizenry.

For some reason, Jesus has been turned into an elitist, favoring the
giving of wealth and power to a few small group while the masses
suffer and starve and work hard for little.  Jesus use to want to

This web site explains what is going on with the "left" and the
"right" in the modern economic sense.
http://www.michaeljournal.org/myth.htm

The meaning of "right" and "left" has changed. I stay with the
original meaning for the same reason I refuse to call homosexual
perverts "gay". The word "gay" was originally a good thing.

The right is for outlawing homosexual perversion,
prostitution, abortions, heroin, and other bad things.  It puts the
good of the nation first and ahead of the freedom of individuals to
corrupt the culture of the nation.

Leftists believe in the Rede of Witchcraft which states-- If it
harm none, do what will you will. This sounds nice, but like the apple
that the witch gave to Snow White it has poison within. The Rede of
Witchcraft is the Bible of liberalism. It would legalize homosexual
perversion, prostitution, drugs, etc.

The right is for building a great nation. Leftists care only
about individual freedom and are opposed to any laws that would make
the nation better. There are beaches where normal families will not go
because homosexual perverts practice their perversion on the beach.
When the liberals say they are for freedom this is kind of thing they
are talking about. Of course people should be free to do what they
want most of the time. There is no argument there. Liberals are
talking about being free to do things that many people object to and
want outlawed.  Their philosophy, taken to its logical conclusion,
would not allow the law that says drivers have to stop at the red
lights. Their philosophy would allow heroin to be sold on grocery
store shelves and allow ads promoting heroin on TV. Their philosophy
would result in chaos and degeneracy.

Libertarians are liberals who want freedom for the Ebenezer
Scrooges to be as greedy as they want. They have the same philosophy
as other leftist who want to legalize heroin and prostitution, namely
that the state can't tell them what they can't do. People don't like
laws stopping them from doing things, and we should sympathize with
that, but sometimes that is not the most important thing. Capitalists
want freedom for greed, other liberals want freedom for degeneracy,
but good laws would make a nation good.

The Communists were leftist and they said they were fighting for
freedom. In Spain they sided with the anarchists. The Communists and
the anarchists were the same people or the same type of people. The
Communists were for having government but only temporarily. They said
that their government was necessary only until the whole world was
Communist. After the world was Communist they wanted to dissolve the
government and have an anarchy.

The right wing cares about the future. Leftists only care about the

Soylent Green or some other futuristic nightmare they are not
interested and insist that nothing could be more important than the
freedom of individuals to be as decadent as they want. To see the kind

libertarians are fighting for see the movie "8MM", they aren't for the
snuff  part, but
other than that it shows liberalism in action.

Sorry to burst your bubble but America has been doing that exact same

country where the wealth is concentrated in a small minority of the
population.

 

Sounds like the private sector does need to be regulated, if the
government did not step in with taxpayer money as it has done
recently, the economy would colapse and America would enter into a
depression.

You really

 

Read your history books about the great depression before you spout

Semantics over capitalism, communism, socialism is meaningless.  There
is a role for government to pay and the recent events on Wall street

Raines and Johnson...both CEOs of those companies and BOTH on staff

Here's a record of these CEOs contribution to Obama.
First, Raines...
http://www.newsmeat.com/fec/bystate_detail.php?st=DC&amp;last=raines&amp;firs...

Here is a Washington Post article that shows Obama has been consulting
Raines on housing policy matters, and it confirms that Raines paid
millions in fines and giving up 22 million in benefits, as a result of
government investigation of accounting problems.  Indeed, the article
even suggests that Raines contributed to the slide of the company.

An MSNBC article confrims that Raines was warned about the accounting
irregularities and did nothing (in fact, certified the results as
accurate, despite knowing they were not)...
http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6189481/

Now, Johnson (also a former chief of staff to Mondale)...
http://www.newsmeat.com/fec/bystate_detail.php?st=DC&amp;last=johnson&amp;fir...
He gave money continually to the Democrats, even during the
Countrywide scadal in which he was involved.  This Fannie Mae LOBBYIST
on Obama's staff gave the Democrats in congress many thousands of
dollars.  As a bundler for the campaign, he has raised 200,000 to
500,000 (nah...Obama wouldn't have incentive to cover for him).

Here's a Washington Post story citing federal officials that said the
accouting was "fraudulent" to give Johnson a huge bonus, when no bonus
was due.  Now, EVEN if you were to suggest that Johnson wasn't
responsible for the accounting oversight that benefited him (by
millions) in undeserved money.  It is evidence that the accounting
system was poorly run by this CEO.

Both from CONGRESSIONAL action and approval.  Obama has applauded
every step, while the GOP has done it hesitantly...both Bush and
McCain have said it was an unpleasant but necessary step.  I disagree
with them, but it still confirms my point.  Obama CELEBRATED the move,
while McCain-Palin has issued speech after speech this week condemning
the government intervention as being a bad thing.

And WHY do you think that Obama is so much in favor of it.  It
couldn't have anything to do with the fact that Obama is the second
highest recipient of Fannie and Freddie LOBBYIST dollars...right?  It
couldn't have anything to do with the fact that Obama has on his staff
two former CEOs of Fannie Mae that were both found guilty of fraud in
running the companies....right?  That's why the current CEOs of these
failed companies are STILL getting bonuses and millions of dollars in
pay, thanks to the congressional action.

Non-sense.  You have no idea what you are saying.  You are simply an

Socialism to ANY degree ultimately ends up in disaster.

Hong Kong prior to 1997 was pure Capitalism.  Since its Communist
takeover it is in decline.
It had the most free economy and the people lived under the highest
degree of freedom than any country in history.
People risked their lives to leave pure Socialism (Communism) just
over the border in order to have this Capitalism and the freedom it
demands from government.

Still to this day never a single person risks their life to "escape"

That's just a glaring dumb thing to say.  Here is the definition of
socialism by Webster:

1: any of various economic and political theories advocating
collective or governmental ownership and administration of the means
of production and distribution of goods

THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SCHOOLS OR UNIONS, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!

Your evidence is lacking.

 

And resigned when his participation was questioned, and hasn't been
involved since.  He also was not "on staff"

 

Not relevant.  Financial contributors are not paid staff.

 

I provided the recent (as in last week) Washington Post article that
shows that the information in its earlier article was misrepresented,
to the level of two Pinocchios.

 

Your evidence that he was a registered lobbyist for Fannie Mae?

 

He was not considered to be on Obama's staff.  He was an unpaid
volunteer for a single task, and he did not remain in that position,
when his history was questioned.

 

Your cites do not mention any legal convictions.  They are newspaper
investigations.

Meanwhile, you ignore the MUCH more active involvement of Duberstein
with McCain.  He was on the Board of Directors that was supposed to be
overseeing the CEO, and was collecting megabucks, while serving on
McCain's campaign.

Then provide us your definition.

 

Profits that they were given by the government in the form of
exceptional tax breaks, and cheap oil leases of federal property, many
of which they are just sitting on.

 

Then provide us your definition.

 

Nazi Germany wasn't socialist, but fascist.  And most of its victims
did not die of old age.

 

Similarly, Communist China was communist, not fascist.  You seem to
not know the difference between these economic systems.

 

Your evidence is lacking.

 

Kennie was just last week on about the million or so Republicans who
are members of the NEA.  Are they Socialists too?

 

Not hardly.  It is arguably based on Lutheranism, since Martin Luther
was the first proponent of universal public education by the state.

 

What is a "Socialist teaching method"?

 

The US school systems long predated unions, and half the states don't
recognize teachers' unions.

 

Martin Luther again.

 

That has existed since pre-Roman times.

 

Your evidence is lacking.

By your implied definition, every country in the world is a "socialist
system" and most of them are NOT failing, but replaced failing systems
that were less "socialist".

The US itself would have failed without its repeated strengthenings of
Federal power in 1787, 1861-8 (Lincoln through the 14th amendment),
1900s (Teddy Roosevelt), WWI (first nationalization of industry for
wartime purposes), and 1932-1945 (FDR)

Rather odd for a country after "Communist takeover" to be considered
