NO ONLINE USE UNTIL MONDAY, MAY 10

If you think getting into a good college is tough, try planning
the ceremony that signals students are ready to leave.

"It's incredibly competitive," said Jason Cook, an executive
at Texas A&M University, where Gen. David Petraeus will address
graduates Thursday.

The invitation to Petraeus, commander of U.S. forces in the
Middle East, was issued more than a year ago, in early 2009.

Other area graduates will hear from Nobel Peace Prize winner
Muhammad Yunus, former presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani and
Gov. Rick Perry before they cross the stage. Former boxing champion
turned entrepreneur George Foreman will speak at the University of
St. Thomas, while singer Lyle Lovett will receive an honorary
degree from the University of Houston. Actor Marcia Gay Harden will
address graduates at the University of Texas at Austin.

Ideally, a commencement speaker reflects the interests of the
students and the times in which they are graduating. A speaker who
can generate buzz among both graduates and their families in the
audience is a bonus.

"The graduation speech is kind of a tough speech," said Mike
Gustin, a professor of biochemistry and cell biology at Rice
University and chairman of the committee that recommended Yunus.
"You want proven leaders who can inspire."

Rice students increasingly are interested in public service,
making Yunus a good fit. Yunus, a banker in Bangladesh, developed
the concept of microcredit -- small loans for people too poor to
qualify for traditional bank loans, allowing them to start
businesses and become self-sufficient.

"We found his work interesting," said Tracy Dansker, a
graduating senior at Rice who served on the committee. Students
wanted a speaker with a recognizable name, she said.

"But we also wanted somebody who would have a message," she
said. "We thought he might have a different message than a
celebrity who made a lot of money and donated it to a cause."

Pairing speaker, message

Similarly, Cook said that Texas A&M looks for speakers who
personify the school's emphasis on public service.

George W. Bush served as speaker in December 2008; former
astronaut Charles Bolden addressed graduates last spring, just
before being named to head NASA.

But snaring a well-known speaker requires persistence,
connections and luck.

The Rice committee submitted Yunus' name, along with several
others, to President David Leebron's office more than a year in
advance.

Gustin declined to name the other people on the list. After all,
those names might come up again, and it wouldn't do to let people
know they weren't the first choice.

Leebron acknowledged the competitive nature of securing a
commencement speaker but said Rice students in recent years have
opted for substance over celebrity.

"The students ... really seem to want individuals and public
intellectuals who can provide an inspirational message," he said
in an e-mail.

Other schools take a lower-key approach, asking local business
leaders, top-ranked graduates or university officials to speak.

Sometimes, it's a student

The University of Houston-Downtown usually selects a student for
the honor. This year it will be Cheryl Chodaniecky, who is
graduating with a management degree.

And even the best plans can change. Houston Community College
announced that Lisa Ling, a television journalist best-known as a
co-host of The View, would address graduates May 15. When Ling
canceled in mid-April, the college went to Plan B, Board Chairman
Michael P. Williams.

Politicians have instant recognition, even if not everyone in
the audience is a fan.

President Barack Obama addressed the class of 2010 at the
University of Michigan last weekend, while Michelle Obama has
agreed to do the honors at George Washington University.

Governor selected
      Texas Southern University will have Perry.

Having a governor or similarly prominent speaker sends students
a dual message, said Wendy Adair, vice president for university
advancement at TSU.

"It gives them the sense that, my graduation is important
enough for him to participate in it," she said, while also
suggesting that TSU is an institution worthy of support by the
state's governor.

UH Law Center graduates will hear from former New York Mayor
Giuliani.

"You want somebody whose achievements in law are very
high-profile," Dean Ray Nimmer said of finding the perfect
commencement speaker. "Giuliani fits that."

Giuliani is a partner in Bracewell & Giuliani, and Nimmer
said a partner from the firm's Houston office made the official
request.

But this spring is old news. Schools already are planning for
2011.

"With any type of national figure, it takes months of
scheduling to make it happen," A&M's Cook said.
