 
 
Kicked out of school for long hair.........
 
 
You know.........even though the school has rules on the length of hair for boys (a rule I disagree with by the way), they should make exceptions for this young man......

 
A few inches of hair stand between J.T. Gaskins and an education.

The 17-year-old, who had been treated for cancer and said he now wants to grow his hair to give to Locks of Love -- a charity that provides wigs for kids who lose their hair due to chemotherapy and other treatments -- was recently suspended from Madison Academy, a charter school in Burton, Mich., for refusing to trim his tresses.

Gaskins told The Flint Journal that he was diagnosed with leukemia as an infant and has been cancer-free since age 7. This is something I want to do, and I feel very strongly about it.

The schools dress code policy, spelled out in the student-parent handbook, says hair must bair must be kept clean, neat, free of unnatural or distracting colors, off the collar, off the ears and out of the eyes for boys.

Gaskins hair, which resembles the windswept bangs of Justin Bieber, dangles at his eyes and covers his ears.

His mother, Christa Plante, told the Journal she supports her son and remembers his cancer fight as a small child. The fact that hes ready to talk about everything he went through, his strength... I cant deny him that. Hes ready to speak out about what hes been through, Plante said, according to the newspaper.

Me personally? I hope the parents are able to sue the school over this bullshit behavior.
 
 
While his thoughts are commendable, the school has rules that predate his decision to grow his hair. He's 17. He'll graduate HS soon enough. If he just cannot wait, he should transfer to a school with more lenient rules. If he's enrolled in a charter school, he's there by choice, not by necessity.
 
 
Exactly. The school administrator may have been a prick about it, but you can't sue someone for being a prick.

Also, as a school employee, I know for a fact that we only hear one side of the story. Locks of Love needs a min of 7 inches. It doesn't sound like this kid is even close. His desire to donate his hair could be complete BS.
 
 
Locks of love is a great charity. I had a boss who had beautiful black hair that grew preternaturally fast and was naturally curly. She'd grow it out until she had 18 inches to whack, then have it whacked, then do it again. She's been doing it for years.

But if this is something he's committed to, perhaps he should attend a school that doesn't have this particular code.....I'm not much for suing schools when people have the right to move their kids.

Because he's a cancer survivior, I don't think so.

And do you know how long it takes to grow hair? I've been growing mine out since a year after I retired, and its still only around 12 inches.

That was 8 years ago.
 
 
Lol...some people grow it a lot faster. My boss cut hers about once a year, and that gave her the full 18 inches.

Mine grows almost that fast.
 
 
I can get a good six inches annual growth, it's about waist length right now.
 
 
The kid won't have enough hair til he's well out of school.

Given a choice to be EXPELLED, or to grow your hair for the next five years or so, seems like a no brainer to me. There is def more to this story. My hunch is that he was on thin ice to begin with. Even Principal Prick would want to keep a great kid when his rep is on the line.

Troo dat!
 
 
Yea there's always more to the story, but I don't think anyone should be expelled for that.
 
 
I think the school should have turned this into something positive and encouraged any kid that wanted to grow his or her hair to be donated on the last day of school.

It would have made national news on the good side of the feel-good spectrum.
 
 
What is funny to me is, back 60 years ago I was suspended for getting a crew cut for the warm weather that was beginning at the end of the school year. Catholic schools require conformity, so both long and short hair were punished.
 
 
Kid has options. He doesn't like the rules, he can leave the school.
 
 
Why should the school make exceptions for some people, but not others? They either have a code or they don't. In this case, they have one. If he doesn't like it, he can attend a school that will embrace his uniqueness. Some schools encourage conformity, and it has its place to, as it levels the playing field. Kids are there to learn, and the rest can be a distraction, and if that's the sort of attitude they have, that's okay...it's beneficial to many students.

And if that isn't the sort of school he wants to be in he has the option of moving to a different one.
 
 
When I was in high school, they had a dress code and your hair could only be a certain length. Also, no facial hair. Shirts had to have a collar. No jeans and tennis shoes could only be worn in gym class. Apparently, we survived it.
 
 
And not all schools have rigorous dress/hair codes. Many encourage individuality and artistic creativity. It's silly to take on a school and try to make it change it when there are other schools available.

Now if it was a rural area, and the only school available to the kid, I'd say he might have more of an argument.

Ya beat me to it, X.

The school could embrace the idea and have a huge donation drive.

Win/Win

Slow growth there guy. Mine's been growing for 10 years and it's about 6 inches above my waist. I have the ends cut about every 6 months and just had 5 or 6 inches cut off. In the 80's, I went 6 years without cutting it and sat on my pony tail or tucked it under my belt when I rode the Harley.
 
 
All you fast hair growth people fill me with sadness. Hell, my hair started getting shorter eventually when I didn't cut it for many a year.

I agree that the kid should have either gotten permission beforehand or waited till he graduated. He may well not have been aware of the dress code beforehand (I seem to remember being fairly oblivious at that age), but it was there before he decided to grow out the hair. I also agree that the school COULD have used this as a good pr thing, but they certainly had no obligation to do so.
 
 
Our schools are zero tolerance zones and we all know that zero tolerance = zero intelligence

They do not care about how long it is, they just want it to meet the styling guidelines.

That said, the guidelines are stupid, and the schools is stupid for enforcing them.

That depends. mine grows almost 2 cm a month. Yours obviously hit its maximum length years ago as, on the average, it should grow about 30 cm (12 in) in 2 years. Different people have different lengths of hair, just like all mammals.

Mine. def grows faster than that. I got my hair cut (down almost all the way) in probably April or May? And it's already a little more than 6 inches. It's weird, my hair just grows very quickly.

Anyways back on topic: the kid violated a rule. I'm sure they gave him a chance. Once you let one kid get away with a rule-so many more kids will start to do it too, and then kids stop respecting the authority/rules of the school.
 
 
They did not ask him to cut off all his hair.It just must be neat and trimmed.If he refused to cut his hair then he should have been kicked out of school.
 
 
Why does anybody care how long a students hair is?

First impressions and perceptions of cleanliness matter. Cancer survivor stories may be interesting, but not necessarily marketable.

A charter school prepares kids for the real world.

And in the real world a person can have his hair any length he wants.
 
 
Yes they can. They can also pierce whatever they want or get a tattoo on their face. But in this job market, it might be unwise. Just like it may be unwise to give up a placement in a charter school. But hey - it's a free country.

The job market has nothing to do with a kid in a charter school. To have an arbitrary rule like this is beyond idiotic.

And if people want to pierce ans tattoo they can deal with the consequences. It ain't any of our business.
 
 
Preparing students for the real world is the business of schools.

We can argue all day long about whether or not they are effective, but that's the goal. I'm not familiar with this academy, but I do know most private schools have strict dress codes - that inc. hair, makeup, and piercings. There's a reason.

Wow that's harsh. I had to get caught drinking before they kicked me out of school. Even then it was only a three day vacation. We had guys that had hair half way down thier back and nobody complained. This kid has Justin Bieber hair,I'd hardly call that long.

I understand it's school rules but considering the circumstances I wonder why the kid can't be allowed to pull his hair back and up out of the way? He may look a bit like a girl but that's his problem.

As the man said, "you can sue a ham sandwhich". They may not win, but I'm sure a creative attorney could find a cause of action.

A creative administrator would make this a 'teaching moment' and offer an exception to the rule based on the young man's life experience and willingness to help others.

BTW, the school adminsitrator should hear all sides of the story, not simply default to a rule which if not enforced is unlikely to cause an injury.

I agree about the tat's and piercings not being good for business but long hair, if you want to call it that, really doesn't matter much now. I've seen male lawyers,teachers ect. with ponytails and no problem. Justin Bieber length hair being considered long is laughable in 2012. I thought school offiicals got over the long hair heart attack after the Beatles in the 60's.

I thought so as well, but I guess with the GOP wanting to return to the "good old days of the 50's and 60's", I guess that means hair styles too.

Shit..........gonna miss all the new styles of slink that the women like to wear nowadays when they switch short mini's for poodle dresses and penny loafers.
 
 
Don't fret darling. Fashion will never die.

Personally, I love long hair on men. My sons would grow their hair down to their shoulders in Catholic school as a small act of rebellion. But when they were threatened with a demerit, they would cut it.

Now they are in college with short hair and beards (ugh) Whatcha gonna do?

I mean shit..........for the 17 years I was a kid in Montana, I had to keep my hair off my ears.

Then............20 years in the U.S. Navy where I had to have short hair and keep the back of my neck clean.

Now? I'm 47 and have hair down to my shoulders. Damn it..........I earned my right to grow it!

As long as he keeps it clean and tied back, I don't see why they should have a problem with it.

One thing I thing people should know about "locks of love" is that the hair you send in, isn't used for making wigs for peole with cancer. No they sell THAT hair to a doll manufacturer and then buy the wigs. I found that out after more than a year of growing my own hair out for them. Then I decided, it would be easier to just send them money.

I'm not sure what makes you think you have the right to do what ever you want on someone else's property. This is a charter school. He chose to go to it; he wasn't forced so he sure as hell isn't being assimilated. Hyperbole fail on your part. They have a dress code. If he doesn't like it then transfer to the regular public school where he lives, just like in the "real" world if this were an employer. Yeah, in the "real" world, you can have long hair and tattoos and piercings like you said, but good luck finding a professional job showing up that way to the interview because in the "real" world you don't have the right to dictate to your employer how you're going to look when you come to work and what you're going to do all day.

That a child is denied a chance to donate to a worth while cause because of an idiotic dress code that has absolutely nothing to do with anything but conformity is zero tolerance. It's more important that he have short hair than he exercise his sense of civic duty.

As I said zero tolerance is zero intelligence.
 
 
He's not being denied shit. If he wants to grow his hair, he can move to a school that doesn't care if his hair is long.

He would only be "denied" anything if he was forced to attend that school, and that school only.

And you know what? Schools aren't supposed to accomodate all whims, even if the intent is positive. They're a place for students to learn. And as noble as his desire to donate his hair, he won't be saving anyone's life by doing it. Nobody is being HARMED by the school's adherence to a dress/hair code.

In other words, he can either pick a different charity that won't require him to flout the rules of the school, or attend a different school. This is what it's like to GROW UP. You make choices and you deal with the hindrances imposed by law and society.
 
 
PS..his parents are douchebags for allowing this to become all about the school.

I'll bet his parents chose the school and he had very little say in the matter.

This kid wants to do something for others, he should be encouraged, not discouraged. The school could have taken this incident and turned it into a lesson for the whole school. They could have just raised money to give to locks of love in this person's name, encouraging him to cut his hair anyway. There are any number of things they could have done so this would end amicably and in favor of locks of love and the boy who tried to grow his hair for them. Of course, had the school simply looked up the program and discovered that the hair wouldn't be used to make wigs for people with cancer, but instead sold to a doll manufacturer, chances are the kid would have gone with a money donation instead anyway.

I disagree. IN this case I think the harm was done and it'll be a cold day in h*ll before the kid tries to do anything for anyone again. What a way to grow up, hating the world and being so rigid that you can't even encourage a kid to help someone.

He chose it, his parents chose it, whatever. The family knew the rules when they went in.

 
This kid wants to do something for others, he should be encouraged, not discouraged. The school could have taken this incident and turned it into a lesson for the whole school. They could have just raised money to give to locks of love in this person's name, encouraging him to cut his hair anyway. There are any number of things they could have done so this would end amicably and in favor of locks of love and the boy who tried to grow his hair for them. Of course, had the school simply looked up the program and discovered that the hair wouldn't be used to make wigs for people with cancer, but instead sold to a doll manufacturer, chances are the kid would have gone with a money donation instead anyway.

 

Sure the school could have let him do it or raised money instead or done a lot of other things, but they don't have to. It's their school. They get to make the rules. If you don't like the rules, you don't go to that school. Would you like if I walked into your home and told you how to run your household?

I really don't understand why this is so difficult to grasp.
 
 
 
He's not being denied shit. If he wants to grow his hair, he can move to a school that doesn't care if his hair is long.

He would only be "denied" anything if he was forced to attend that school, and that school only.

And you know what? Schools aren't supposed to accomodate all whims, even if the intent is positive. They're a place for students to learn. And as noble as his desire to donate his hair, he won't be saving anyone's life by doing it. Nobody is being HARMED by the school's adherence to a dress/hair code.

In other words, he can either pick a different charity that won't require him to flout the rules of the school, or attend a different school. This is what it's like to GROW UP. You make choices and you deal with the hindrances imposed by law and society.

 

Dress codes and short hair do not improve the quality of education and do not improve the character of students.

They are arbitrary and meaningless meant only to force conformity and limit free thinking.
 
 
 
 
 
No it's not.

 

Yes, it is because whether or not he is a better student with long hair or short hair is not the topic of discussion.

 
A zero tolerance society is a mindless society.

 

I agree and I don't support zero tolerance policies. I have no issue with this incident, however, because as already stated numerous times, he is not required to attend that school. He chose to attend it knowing what the policies were from the beginning just like everyone else attending it does.

 

I'll bet his parents chose the school and he had very little say in the matter.

Yes, they could have done that. But they didn't. Maybe they have a rule about raising money at the school. Who knows. The point of the matter is, there is no law keeping him at this school, and many schools have policies meant to limit distractions so that students focus on ACADEMICS rather than appearances or outside interest (or social standing).

And again, if his parents force him to attend this school, and then have a fit over the rules, they're douchebags. They're using their kid, and it's disgusting. Tell him to cut his hair, or move him.

Bullshit. They're meant to limit distractions so children can focus on academics. They also level the playing field as far as economic and social stature go, because they prevent children from displaying their status via clothing and other symbols. AND they cut down significantly on gang recognition.

Also, they reduce cost to parents SIGNIFICANTLY and make getting ready for school much, much less complicated, which reduces stress associated with going to school. Kids who don't have to worry about whether their clothing is up to snuff and who know they look exactly like everyone else, rich, poor, or indifferent, are kids who have one less thing to worry about...which means they're in a better place for learning.

Kids will form the same gangs no matter what they are forced to wear.

And I have yet to see anyone distracted by someone else's long hair.

The economic argument is pure horse shit.

It costs the same to buy a few pairs of pants and a few shirts no matter what color they are.
