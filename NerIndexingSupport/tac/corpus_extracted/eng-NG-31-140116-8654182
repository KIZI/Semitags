Reche visits Jets

By Mike Reiss, Globe Staff

The Jets hosted free-agent receiver Reche Caldwell on a visit at their team
headquarters today.
The visit comes one day after Caldwell was released by the Patriots.
The Jets have six receivers on the roster: Jerricho Cotchery, Laveranues
Coles, Justin McCareins, Brad Smith, Wallace Wright and Chansi Stuckey.
It is possible that they have genuine interest in Caldwell, who led the
Patriots with 61 receptions last season. Or they might be more interested
in some information he could pass along about how the Patriots are
preparing to attack the Jets.

Silly if they are. Likely the gameplanning wasn't done until all cuts
were made. Plus I think Mangenius knows what they plan to do. He
worked alongside BB and knows how he attacks defenses. They've played
each other enough to know what to expect.

The Jets follow the Patriots like a hounddog--sniffing for information,
signing coaches and castoffs, etc. They must be still ticked off over losing
Belichick.
