Are you referring to James River and Suisin Bay?
 
 
Siuson Bay, October 2006 after inspecting USS Iowa.

Ghost Fleet 2:
 
 
I thought those ships were supposed to be kept in a condition that they could be fast reactivated when needed but uhm..ok they dont really look like that...
 
 
USS Mispillion with Sea Shadow barge alongside. Part of large ghost fleet in Siuson Bay off of Benicia, California.
 
 
Very nice photos. I agree with Tarek though. Those ships look to be in decrepit condition.
 
 
If there is no money to keep them in a somewhat good condition why not scrap them completly? I mean its not like they are useful for anything in that conditition and it must hurt like hell for anyone who was on board of one of those to see them like this..

I think they just look bad on the outside, which is not too much trouble to clean up. What's important is how the inside is maintained. I'm sure Rusty can tell us more about it.
 
 
Because they're worth more assembled than disassembled, maybe the US Navy can offer to sell these ships minus weaponry and electronic systems to other allied third world countries.
 
 
Hey cRusty, aren't all those ships basically in "safe storage" meaning they're just rusting away?

With the exception of the Iowa, in a word, YES.

Actually, the Mispillion is no longer there. She has been towed to the Gulf Coast for scrapping.

Not all the ships have dehumidification (D/H) systems on them. Iowa has 9 machines all in operating order with even a back up generator on deck should shore power be lost.

Here's the most expensive catamaran ever built in the world, USS Pigeon. With the decommissioning of her, her sister ship Ortolan and both DSRV's we no longer have a rescue system for submarines that have bottomed out but did not go below crush depth (as the Russian subs always seem to do),
 
 
Iowa is still kept up in fair shape. Whenever MARAD can requisition some more paint or decking they put it on the Iowa.
 
 
Some of the ships don't look too bad there:
 
 
But they can go from bad
 
 
To worse
 
 
Thats really bad to see. Bet it hurts like hell to see your ship in that condition :( poor girls.

Any reason they keep the Iowa in better condition? Or just because they like it?
 
 
Are these some of the same ships (4) that were towed to Hartlepool UK for dismantling, app 4 years ago, and i believe are still there as a licence has not been issued to the firm to dismantle them ( could have by now tho ) ?

Perhaps because she is still listed as a Cat B mobile asset and must be maintained until removed from the register.

These photos were taken just last October in 2006 after we finished our second inspection and evaluation of the Iowa. Only the MARAD people know exactly which ship is which. However, when asked about certain ships, they would point them out for us so we could photograph them.

This is in Siusun Bay just off of Benicia, California (up the river and east of Vallejo and Mare Island).

No, they were not tour guides but as they were manuevering their water taxi from one group of ships to the other to pick up other MARAD workers we got lucky with the views.

That is correct as well as both California Senators want the ship put SOMEWHERE in California as a museum. So when authorized visitors or inspection parties (such as mine) board the ship, there won't be any complaints about totally ignoring it.

I must say, though MARAD funds are limited and once got an unqualified sub-contractor, they are doing a tremendous amount of work to keep the ship preserved.

My hat is off to them.
 
 
Hey Guys,

I just found this site, and quickly registered so I could ask for your help. My father served on the USS Papago, an ocean tug, during WWII. I have been doing some research on this ship, and the last record I can find is from 1997.

I have a picture of the Papago in this ghost fleet in Virginia.

Does anybody know what ships are still there? I fear this ship has been scraped by now. I would love to get close enough one time to lay my eyes on her.

My dad passed away in 1993, and I find myself seeking all the information I can find about his naval service.

Thanks for any info.

Welcome to the World Affairs Board.

The register of ships in the ghost fleets change weekly and I doubt there is any up-to-date list readily available to us common folk. However, if you contact the Marine Adminstration (MARAD) in Virginia they may be able to give you some information on the ship.

Another possible source of info would be the Inactive Ship Facility back there generally in overall charge of mothballed ships.

You can order your dad's military records from the National Personnel Records Center and you can also get one free replacement set of the medals and ribbons he earned.

You can also get the Presidential Memorial Certificate recognizing your dad's service to the country. Both records and certificate information can be located through Google.

Do you know if something like this exists in Canada?

Well said, Dick.  

I wish some people had more moral integrity and would publicly apologize for claiming back in 2001 (  Link#1 ,  Link#2  ) that "MARAD does not have the ability to care for a mobilization asset like the Iowa ".      
 
 
 
Do you know if something like this exists in Canada?

 

You'd probably have to check with the National Archives of Canada or the Chief Military Personnel (CMP) website as a start for military records.

As for the Presidential Memorial Certificate, it was initiated by JFK in 1962.

Mr. L. I dont doubt that MARAD is well capable of caring for Iowa, but would she not be better served in Norfolk with Whiskey? My reasoning is that since Whiskey is on the same bill as the Iowa she is well maintained from what collegues that have inspected her several times over have said. Would it not force the hands on care of the Iowa as well fitting the very same status as Whiskey. You know nobody would want her seen as delapidated especially when compared to her sister in reserve.

The East and Gulf coasts already have an overwhelming monopoly of Battleship museums. There is none on the West Coast. Actually only two Aircraft Carriers (the Hornet in Alameda and the Midway in San Diego).

As for MARAD's capabilities of maintaining the ship, they are extremely limited by small budgets, lack of personnel and this is normally not their job. However, extra measures are being taken to have the ship in somewhat of a decent condition for turnover to a museum.

This is because many people screamed to high heaven about the Navy's total lack of care when Iowa was anchored off of Rhode Island for a couple of years with NO dehumidification power and NO cathodic protection.

When she was moved to Benecia, several organizations (including myself when I was registered as Dreadnaught Consulting) bugged the hell out of Bremerton (INACTSHIPFAC for all of west coast mothball fleets) and they made sure power was run out to her for D/H and installed over-the-side Impressed Current Cathodic Protection anodes.

The ship still shows damage from her Rhode Island "abandonment" such as leaf plugged deck drain piping that filled full of water, froze in winter bursting the pipe and running water down into the compartment below when Spring came.

This is all fixable and even MARAD does some patching here and there when they can with what materials they can afford.

Pic: Flaking paint on overhead where a broken deck drain flooded the compartment up to 8 inches deep. Paint is of wrong formula and excess moisture from the flooding is causing it to peel off.
 
 
My impression was that the MARAD ships are just being stored awaiting disposal. The problem being that environmentally sound disposal is difficult to find. Even moving the MARAD ships might cause environmentalists to get upset. For the warships, the situation was different. My impression was the warships, i.e. Iowa, are at least paid for from the USN budget. Thus, they are in better material condition. Is that not the case?

That's getting into an area I'm not experienced on. Seeing the condition of most of the ships in Benicia I tend to agree with you that the Iowa is an exception to the rule and more care is taken of her than the AK's, AO's, etc. that are anchored there.

Mothballed combat ships I have inspected in Bremerton are kept in pretty good shape. That included two Battleships and two Carriers we were on. But then, MARAD isn't the "contract" agency caring for them.

As for environmentalist concerns, they have justification. When Missouri was towed from Bremerton to Pearl Harbor, she was berthed for a week in the fresh water of the Columbia River to kill off Bremerton fouling and not transport it to Hawaii.

They were perfectly justified in this. When the BB Floating Dry Dock was towed from Subic Bay to Pearl, WESTPAC critters were still sticking to it and started to pollute the Mid Pacific waters of Pearl Harbor.

Strange story about that Dry Dock. It was towed from Guam to Subic Bay back in the late 70's and a Filipino friend of mine was the General Foreman Rigger in charge of erecting the side walls. Prior to the Guam assignment, that same Floating Dry Dock was berthed at Long Beach Naval Station until the 1960's.
 
 
Hi Guys,

Was browsing the Forum and registered to pass on what may be of help. Went to Suisun Bay in 2006 to research my book on the USN and took many pictures from a charter boat.

Of interest to you guys might be the following link which is updated regularly by MARAD, listing all of the vessels in the reserve anchorages and their status. It takes a little time but I managed to identify the majority of ships at Suisun Bay (and Hawaii). Hope this helps.

Environmental groups sue for removal of 'mothball fleet'
Groups complain the fleet is generating toxic pollution.
The Associated Press

SAN FRANCISCO Several environmental groups on Monday sued the federal government over toxic pollution caused by a fleet of mothballed warships floating near San Francisco Bay.

The groups accuse the U.S. Maritime Administration of violating state and federal environmental regulations as dozens of decaying ships linger well past a congressional deadline ordering their removal.

The suit was filed Monday afternoon in U.S. District Court in Sacramento.

"These vessels have long since ceased being useful for transportation and are now just floating junkyards," according to the complaint brought by the Natural Resources Defense Council, Arc Ecology and San Francisco Baykeeper.

More than 70 ships comprise the Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet, some dating back to World War II. The old ships were once kept afloat in case of war, but many have fallen into disrepair, overtaken by rust and rot.

The suit asks the court to order the federal agency to prepare an official review of the environmental impact caused by the ships and to remove hazardous wastes – including paint, discarded oil and asbestos – from the vessels.

The head of the Maritime Administration said in a statement that the agency was engaged in "ongoing and extensive efforts to ensure the safety of these vessels."

"The best way, ultimately, to protect the Suisun Bay is to remove these vessels in as timely a manner as possible," Maritime Administrator Sean T. Connaughton said. "We hope this latest development does not needlessly delay our efforts to remove these vessels."

A congressional order set a 2006 deadline to scrap more than 50 ships, but a regulatory quagmire has kept the fleet anchored in place in the shallow, brackish inland waters east of San Francisco Bay.

Before they can be scrapped and sold, Coast Guard regulations require the removal of barnacles and other sea creatures clinging to the obsolete ships' hulls. That process causes toxic paint to flake off into the water. Fear of contamination has delayed their disposal.

Disposal operations in the country's two other reserve fleets in Beaumont, Texas, and on the James River near Newport News, Va., were also halted after the discovery of paint in Suisun Bay, though recent agreements with both states paved the way for disposal to resume.

A February study commissioned by the federal government suggested that even without the scraping, paint flaking off the Suisun Bay ships has shed tons of toxic heavy metals into estuary sediments.

Earlier this month, California water regulators informed the federal agency it could be fined up to $25,000 per day if it fails to come up with a plan to stop the paint from falling into the water.

The fines have not yet been issued, said Bruce Wolfe, executive officer of the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board.

But state regulators have seen "very little progress in terms of what the Maritime Administration will do to stop the ongoing discharge of hazardous materials from the ships," Wolfe said.
 

I do see their point. Some of these ships are well over 40 years old. Why didn't we blow them up instead of using newly decommissioned ships like the Sprucan class and one of the Ticos?

The problem is moving them may cause as much environmental damage as letting them rot in place. It's a damned if you do, damned if you dont situation.

I can see that part of the problem too. Why didn't the navy blow them up like 15 years ago when they weren't so dilapidated? Did someone just say "hey it's too much trouble to move them, let's just let them sit and save ourselves some trouble?"

Nice to see there are still a few of those bad boys left in reserve. I was surprised to read above that she was removed from Subic Bay. A friend was an officer onboard the America (CV66) and they transported a few Iowa class rifles to Subic. Whereas I have also read that a few went by an LS class ship.  

Myself I have only been aboard one transportable dry dock that one belonged to Sun ship of Chester. That was eons ago before they sold her off.  
 
 
If anybody is interested, I've ID'd almost every ship visible in the USN Reserve Fleets and MARAD Reserve Fleets on wikimapia, which uses the (very dated) sat imagery visible on google maps.

NISMF Philadelphia:
 Wikimapia - Let's describe the whole world!

How old is this imagery of Philly Naval Reserve? By the way the PG (Patrol Gunboat) you have listed as PG-100 Ex USS Douglas is actually PG-90 USS Cannon. There are also a few other ships missing from the imagery, This is why I was wondering how old the imagery is. Nice job though.  

There are a few in Bremerton that are no longer among the "floating" as well such as the fast supply ships Camden and Sacramento if memory serves.
 
 
The Philly pics are from spring/summer 2007. The Bremerton pics are older than the hills, with the Camden, Sacramento, Mississippi and South Carolina visible - all of which have been scrapped and the Knox and David R. Ray which have been sunk.

Dont worry, the Canon is there - moored to the Port side of the Lauren. In fact, the Canon is still in Philly, supposedly having arrangements made to be towed to Sheboygan along with the USS Edson
 
 
Are there any new pics, I mean from 2009 of the current state of Iowa??? I'd like to see that she hasn't gone down hill at a rapid rate of knotts.
 
 
Best bet is to surf through the west coast ship preservation sites like the Red Oak Vic, Jeremiah O'Brien etc to see if they have any pictures from their recent trips to Suisun Bay.

Of course, you can always check on PMARS, which has some old & recent pics of the Iowa.

Incidentally, more recent studies have concluded that the mothball fleet in Suisun bay is not a major source of contamination in the Bay. Naturally, the Chronicle has put the worst possible spin on the report in its headline:

 Mothball fleet's flaking paint taints shellfish .

The Suisun Bay fleet is almost entirely old junk like break bulk cargo ships from the early 60s. There is a proposal floating around to open a ship breaking facility on Mare Island, though I am not sue how far it has gone.
 
 
Its funny to read such reactionary news story crapola written by somebody who has probably never even seen the SBRF.

When I was at the James River Reserve Fleet this April the ships were quite literally alive with seabirds. Every ship had at least 5-10 Osprey nests in it and there were usually 40-60 cormorants sunning and resting on each ship. Some environmental catastrophe.
 
 
It is funny to see that the report mentions no major environmental impact, but the Chronicle headline is designed to make the reader think the opposite.   It is true that many of these ships seem to be at risk of sinking at their mooring if not scrapped soon. I believe the Mare Island facility is looking for stimulus dollars to open up and start scrapping.
 
 
Does anybody have any recently taken pictures from TAO Andrew J Higgins mothballed in suisun bay?
Chilean navy has bought her for 50 million dollars plus refitting and is expected to be handed over at the begining of next year
 
 
^^ Nothing has been recently posted on the ship's PMARS page to indicate she has left the reserve fleet yet.  PMARS Ship Record Detail - ANDREW J. HIGGINS 

While the PMARS page is often a few days/weeks behind actual events, once the ship departs under tow to the conversion yard it should appear there. Once she's under tow or in the yard I'd expect pics to start appearing Chilean Navy and military forum sites.

Oh, Im not worried I see the reserve fleet every day (except saturdays)  

Yep, Cannon is slated to be donated as a museum ship. Neat little ships they were for their time.
 
 
Nice, I damn near drove off the bridge the first time I went past the Philly NISMF trying to see what was in there.

I'm glad to see the Cannon is being preserved. There are far too few memorials to the small boat navy these days, and the Cannon will make a nice museum for her class, now that she's the last in her original configuration. I think the former Chehalis (PG-94) and Grand Rapids (PG-98) are in service as research craft with the Naval Sea Systems Command in Panama City, but they both have likely been pretty heavily modified.

Dear Rumrunner:
I apprecciated very much your quick anwer.
By the way are there any new pics, I mean from 2009 of the current state of Higgins? the posted picture is pretty old ( 2005).
I ´ll be awaiting news from TAO 190 A. Higgings departing
Thank you again
 
 
 
Here's the most expensive catamaran ever built in the world, USS Pigeon. With the decommissioning of her, her sister ship Ortolan and both DSRV's we no longer have a rescue system for submarines that have bottomed out but did not go below crush depth (as the Russian subs always seem to do),

 

The Ortolan was recently sold for scrapping out of James River Reserve Fleet, part of a 2-ship deal which included the last WWII-configured APA, the USS Gage (APA-168). As it breaks down, each was sold for:

USS Ortolan: $325,090.00 (Or $4.38/cwt // $87.72/ton)
USS Gage $564,910.00 (Or $4.10/cwt // $82.19/ton)

Both are awaiting their respective tows to Brownsville and scrapping at ESCO Marine.
 
 
USS Gage (APA-168) was towed from the Reserve Fleet at Fort Eustis on July 30th bound for Browsville where she will be scrapped at Esco Marine.

Gage is the last surviving WWII-configured Haskell Class Attack Transport, based on the VC2-S-AP5 Victory Ship hull design. A combat Veteran of Okinawa and a member of the US occupation forces postwar in the Phillipines, Japan, and China the Gage also brought several thousand US Vets home as part of Operation Magic Carpet. Following her decom in 1947, she was layberthed in Norfolk for 11 years before shifting to the James River Reserve Fleet in 1958, where she remained until last Thursday.

Here's a few pics I took of her last April when I was aboard her.

Could you please let me know if is she still moored there or is under refit elsewhere. Do you have the chance to take a look?
Supposedly will be delivered to the chilean navy mids next year

The Higgins is over in Suisun Bay, I'm on the East Coast - maybe somebody who lives/works in that area and is on this board may be of assistance. Being that she's now a MARAD ship, I'd expect the pre-transfer work to be done in local non-usn shipyard, and I believe the closest to Suisun Bay able to handle the job would be Cascade General in Portland, where a number of ships either entering or leaving the Reserve Fleet are sent.

This is my first post to the forum. Thought I'd let you know the current situation of the MARAD ships currently moored up at Graythorp Yard on the outskirts of Hartlepool. This is home to Able UK's, Teesside Environmental Reclamation & Recycling Centre (TERRC).

Able UK were awarded the full planning permissions and environment permits last year. So the go ahead of scrapping ships is starting to happen after 5 years of delays due to a small group of individuals protesting (who were ill informed, spreading ill informed information and scare stories).

Caloosahatchee, Canisteo, Canopus & Compass Island from the US MARAD Fleet, so called "Ghost Ships". These are accompanied by 3 British vessels and the French Aircraft Carrier Clemenceau awaiting scrapping.

I personally hope that with everything in place at TERRC, Able UK will be able to attract more MARAD ships in the future. I hope for some of the Aircraft Carriers in the coming years, Please.  

The Cofferdam has been built and is complete also there is an internal bund built. Remdial work on the MARAD ships has been carried out, once the dock is dry the waste will be taken off then scrapping can start. It is understood from press reports here that the MARAD ships will have been completey scrapped by December this year.

I hope you enjoy the shots.

Welcome to the board!

Head on over to the Intro Forum and tell us about yourself!  
 
 
I did contact MARAD about retrieving artifacts from the USS Mispillion (AO-105). They usually stow such items on the APL that serves as their offices, life jacket issue, hardhat issue, etc. They told me the artifacts are still on board and Mispillion has been given another two year reprieve.

The Mispillion Veterans Assoc have asked me (as President of Friends of the Navy) that the next time I take an inspection team up there to retrieve the artifacts for them.
 
 
Welcome JonHare, and great pics. I'm still surprised those ships are sitting there unscrapped because of some lead paint and asbestos (and by some, I mean tons). I figured by the time they dragged the Clemenceau over that Able UK would have had the permits and related whatnot to get cutting on the USN ships. Ah well. Still sad to see such old battlewagons get cut up.

Rusty - Have you seen the PMARS site for the Mispillion? While it does not have any catalouged artifacts from the ship per-se the SRBF warehouse certainly will.
 PMARS Ship Record Detail - MISPILLION 
 
 
For those interested parties, here is the present listing of the ever-dwindling James River Reserve Fleet, with the only exception being that the former USS Cape Cod (AD-42) was just sold for scrapping.

I'll be heading down for the 2nd time this year from Sept 20-23rd to pick at the USS Sylvania and USS Shenandoah for spares and electrical cable for my ship, so I'll throw some pics up here of the trip.

From what I understand Philly will be loosing one of three destroyers in the basin as a artificial reef. I'll see if I can find anything/  
 
 
Maybe its the Radford? The Charles F. Adams is there too, seemingly on a perpetual donation hold for a museum group in Jacksonville.

From what rumor holds its DD946 the Edson a Forrest Sherman class.  
 
 
Wow, I hope thats not true. She's in far better shape than either the Radford, Adams or Forrest Sherman, all of which are still there.

I remember going on the Edson as a little kid when she was with the Intrepid. From what I can find Sheboygan is applying to get her and the former USS Canon towed up there as museum ships, but those applications were sent in long before the economic toilet flush.

Sad end to a Veteran ship, NHL and a member of the NRHP if she does get reefed though.

Hey Guys,

I just found this site, and quickly registered so I could ask for your help. My father served on the USS Papago, an ocean tug, during WWII. I have been doing some research on this ship, and the last record I can find is from 1997.

I have a picture of the Papago in this ghost fleet in Virginia.

Does anybody know what ships are still there? I fear this ship has been scraped by now. I would love to get close enough one time to lay my eyes on her.

My dad passed away in 1993, and I find myself seeking all the information I can find about his naval service.

Thanks for any info.

Does any nation besides the U.S. keep a reserve fleet?
 
 
England does just upriver from Portsmouth, and I know the Greeks keep a few older ships no longer in service in Souda Bay
 
 
I would suppose that the ex-Soviet fleet laying in the waters along the Baltic coast are not really a "mothballed reserve fleet"?  
 
 
 
I would suppose that the ex-Soviet fleet laying in the waters along the Baltic coast are not really a "mothballed reserve fleet"?  

 

One could suppose that, and also suppose the same thing for the dozens of ships they have littering the inlets around Murmansk. All in 'reserve' in some shape or form.

Ships kept in true reserve status have a significant amount of equipment onboard to maintain humidity control in internal spaces, prevent flooding and have regular maintenance crew visits to turn over their prop shafts and perform inspections.

Like say half a dozen aircraft carriers in the US and UK?   Along with Amphibious ships and Replenishment ships.
 
 
You mean like this?

"Murmansk" A Russian Sverdlov class cruiser built 1955 one of the last all gun cruisers decommitioned 1987 scrapped 1995 Lost 1994 while in tow to India for scrap along the berents coast between North cape and Tromso is now aground on Soeroey Finmark.
 
 
Hows about a pre WWII Catalina flying boat.  

In of all places a beach in Saudi Arabia. Off the Straits of Tiran.
 
 
That looks like a warbird collector's dream. Pre-war configuration, easy access and relatively good condition.... wonder why it's still there?
 
 
Probably full of scorpions....
 
 
Finally, after years of delay, action on the Suisun bay fleet:

 Warships near San Francisco Bay to be recycled 

I guess the plan to open a ship breaking facility at Mare Island is dead, since they plan to clean the hulls in SF and then tow the ships to Brownsville.
 
 
When I was last at the JRRF the director of fleet operations said that the large scale scrapping program of the older ships there was wrapping up and that Suisun Bay was next to be thinned.

With that in mind, I'm willing to venture that the following ships are about to meet their ends:

The article I read said the first two ships slated to be pulled from Suisun Bay are the Earlham Victory and the Pan American Victory, both, as the name indicates, old Victory ships built in the Richmond shipyards in 1945 (my grandfather worked there during WWII).

Not surprising that the Victorys are the first to go. The Mission Santa Ynez will probably follow next, being that they are the oldest ships in the fleet and have the highest quality pre-nuclear steel in them.

The rationale, at least in the JRRF was to get rid of the highest risk sinkers and leakers first, which are usually the older ships in the fleet.
 
 
It's about time to get rid of some junk. There is absolutely zero chance that any of these ships could possibly be re-commissioned by the navy. They could be used as museums, but someone will have to pay for them.

I agree about the breakbulkers. As modern as they once were they are pretty much useless today except for spare parts hulks. I could see more of a use for the Tankers if things really hit the fan, but at this point their engines and operating systems are getting too outdated for younger sailors to operate effectively.

The former military hardware might have had some purpose for a foreign navy, particularly the AOR's and amphibs, but looks like the offer's off the table. Going once....twice....
 
 
Man, am I glad I found this place! Every time a "lady of glory" is cut up and scrapped I feel a twinge. Think of how useful a couple of carriers would have been after Katrina. FEMA spent millions renting cruise ships! Like the government doesn't have any ships of their own? Sheesh! My Alma-mater, CV-63 is now relegated to rust! Does any one know the status of the two carriers that were being held in Newport, the Saratoga and the Forrestal" I know they planned on scuttling the Forrestal. They would serve nicely as a replacement for Gitmo. Anchor em offshore and we don't have to let those idiots into the uS!

I have read this thread for sometime but never posted anything. Now I have been on most of these ships over the last 10 years except for the American Reliance, Racer, Dawn and Gettysburg since they were of no interest to the USS Hornet. I heard on 10/27, when up there, that the Pan American Victory and Earlham Victory are supposed to go over to San Francisco for prepping before leaving on their final voyage. The Pan American is in the worst condition of the 4 Victory ships. The Dawn and Racer aren't much better and neither is the Taluga. The oldest ship up there, Nereus (12/1941), seems to be on historical review at the moment. Still it will be awhile for it to leave. The Patrick and Pope have already been put off limits to parts hunters which happens when there is a contract to scrap the metal. I expect the AOR's not to be going anywhere for some years since many went in Suisun around 1995.Tuesday I was aboard the Tulare and then Roanoke, Wabash and Nereus in Row G. We boarded Row G via the Iowa. As is usual I took my camera for that and if interested you can fine 97 shots of the Iowa on my web site.

Someone mentioned Wabash. Here's a shot of the main electrical panels. Note that the lights are on above. The engine room was pretty much spotless for an engine room.
 
 
I greatly enjoyed those photos. Thanks for posting them.  
 
 
In a strange sort of way I like seeing Iowa like this (great pics btw) rather than all dolled up and made 'tourist friendly'. But as long as the battleships are saved I'm happy.
 
 
Excellent photos tbm3fan. Good to see that the old ships on the left coast and old ships on the right are in pretty much the same condition.  

And man oh man, my group has got to get onboard the Patrick. We have the exact same gyro and we need all the excess steam plant parts we can get our hands on!
 
 
Unfortunately both the Patrick and Pope have now been put off limits to parts hunters. Recently, we from the Hornet, and a crew from the Red Oak Victory were getting what we could. Since it is now off limits that tends to mean the ships have been sold and MARAD now has no legal right to let anybody inside them. Of course these deals sometimes fall through.Too bad as just wandering them was an experience in and of itself. Saw several parts in there tagged by BB-59 USS Massachusetts dating to 2003 yet obviously they never came back for them.
 
 
Was there any thought by the Navy to create a reserve fleet in any part of the Great Lakes system?

Not likely. Anything worth saving is too big or too much trouble to tow up to the Lakes. There are also freshwater locations besides the Great Lakes, like USS New Jersey's current locale.

Don't the great lakes freeze? Probably not the best choice of storage location. Wouldn't the freezing ice slowly crush the hulls of the ships?

Not always. If ice forms in a calm protected area and is not subject to heavy winds or currents while frozen it wont exert the tons of pressure needed to crack into a ships hull. When wind, waves and currents push ice sheets around and into each other or the shoreline, pressure ridges build in the ice. That is was destroys ships hulls.

Most, if not all of the US bulk carriers on the lakes are layberthed inside the fjord-like docks in Toledo, and their Canadian counterparts in Thunder Bay. Alongside the docks the water freezes around and sometimes under the hull of the ship but after that it pretty much stays put as one enormous ice cube. Provided the ship doesnt touch bottom it will stay well-supported and relatively safe until the next season.

The 3 key reasons I think there is no major USN reserve fleet in the Great Lakes are 1). Lock dimensions are too narrow for most USN ships 2). Lack of proper shipyard/refit facilities in Lake Ontario (closest to the open ocean) 3). Prohibitive cost and legal issues in towing decommed vessels from the nearest Navy Bases (Norfolk, Portsmouth).

There are plenty of freshwater locations for reserve fleets to be located, and many were placed in areas that were freshwater like Astoria, OR, Green Cove Springs FL, Wilmington NC and North of Mobile AL when the US had a shocking overabundance of merchant and naval hulls to deal with.
 
 
We really should keep these old ships sea-worthy. When the Cylons and/or Skynet attack and render all of our new, networked combat systems inoperative, we'll need some good old-fashioned fighting power to save the human race.

High energy lasers + radar targeting = nothing flies again. Aircraft, satellites, artillery rounds even.

All technology filters down eventually (take nukes for instance). We could end up back in trenches and firing close quarter broad-sides again someday.

The ex-USS Saipan LHA-2 (a ghost, this ship was supposed to have been sunk a few years back) It was towed to Norfolk and then re-towed back to Philadelphia. This just shows you that not all MARAD records are exactly accurate.

It appears to be a different shade if color.
 
 
The ex-USS John F. Kennedy CV-67. If you look close enough, you can see her mast laying down on the stern.
 
 
The ex-USNS Joshua Humphreys TA0-188. A Henry J. Kaiser class fleet oiler.

*Must have slipped out since these pics were taken in October of this year. With where she was moored she could have easlily slipped away without anyone noticing. They tend to tow ships out at night around here, but if you are on 495 in Delaware its quite hard to miss a ship getting towed out. Just look up since the channel comes so close to the roadway.  
 
 
The grapevine has it that Philadelphia may be expecting two more CV's very soon for storage. KittyHawk and Saratoga. Not sure if accurate but not surprising either.  
 
 
Just google Saipan and Brownsville (photo of Saipan entering the Brownsville shipping channel). The Saipan is at the breakers in Tx. Left Philadelphia before the big Nor' Easter.
 
 
Nice pics Dread - why are the Sara and Kitty Hawk coming to town? The Sara is currently up in RI with the Forrestal, is the USN shutting down operations up there for good? And I thought the Kitty was in Bummertown where she'll stay for the forseeable future. Odd rumors indeed. Not too long ago the Forrestal was slated to be sunk as a deepwater reef...I wonder if that has changed.

Did the conveyor get painted astern of the New Jersey?  

It appears to be a different shade if color.

 

In the northern latitudes during late fall through winter, the sunlight (lower over the horizon than in summer) on the ships reflect back a tan color. It only looks haze gray when you get up very close to it or on board.
 
 
I did a week on the Saipan back in 99. She was doing MV-22 trials/test. We used her for a TCAT. (Type Commanders Amphibious Training).

She was pretty beat up back then. Ooh well another of the ships I played on going to the breakers.

She was pretty beat up back then. Ooh well another of the ships I played on going to the breakers.

 

She almost went to the breakers back in the 80's. It was in the era of "The Perfect Storm" (Al Gore; please take note) and had the entire starboard side of her bow caved in.

Within the same year, but in the Pacific instead of the Atlantic, her sister ship Belleau Wood had the port side of her bow caved in. Belleau Wood was sunk last year as a reef.

Inspection of the welds of the framing to the hull plating was very poorly done with the "Short Arc" method which uses direct polarity instead of reverse polarity. Direct polarity, with the welding rod on the positive end of the arc, puts all the heat into the welding rod and it only puddles onto the base metal. Reverse polarity (standard for ALL structural welding) puts the base metal as the positive end of the arc and allows it to fuse together while the welding rod merely fills in the joint.

It took the Navy yards several years to cut out all the bad welding fillets with chipping guns or a No. 5 scarfing tip on a torch so it could be re-welded correctly with reverse polarity.

I don't know if Ingalls, who built the ships, were charged for the re-welding or if the "warranty" had run out and the taxpayers had to pick up the tab. But as the structural project leader for that class of ships (Long Beach was the planning yard) they gave me nightmares even before the caved in bows.

I was in the Battleship Configeration Managers office when the welding of the LHA's was fully inspected and we got a "panic" order from NAVSEA to make sure we do not use "short arc" welding on the Battleships. But we were a NAVY yard, not a private contractor and knew better anyway.
 
 
Rusty have you got any photo's of the LHA's with caved in bows? BTW as I know you know the Belleau Wood was sunk in Sinkex 2006 out of Pearl. There is a 2006 post from you stating that you thought it was waste (you wanted a drive on drive off conversion).

The Belleau Wood, in my personal opinion, was the best of all five LHA's. But she was the middle one built and lessons learned from the first two were corrected (such as the thickness of the bottom plate of the aft docking skeg). However, Ingalls still didn't use the right kind of paint for the fuel tanks and we had to sandblast every one and repaint them.

As for drive on - drive off, I did that on the Tarawa. We got selected to go on a family day cruise from San Diego to Long Beach. Besides myself was my wife, our daughter, a friend of ours (who is now our daughter's father-in-law) and two of his sons (one is now my son-in-law). We drove down to San Diego in the Chrysler LeBaron we owned then, drove up the ramp from the pier to the lower vehicle deck and then up the ramp to the upper vehicle deck scraping the bottom of the car at the upper edge of the ramp.

It was a nice cruise back to Long Beach and our future son-in-law and his brother had fun challenging other ships with Tarawa's Radar and getting their ranges.

I also wanted to show them what parts of the ship broke apart during its Grade A shock test (I was assigned to inspect them and recommend repairs) but they really didn't want to know that. As we were going up the aft Aircraft elevator to the flight deck, I happened to mention, "Oh, this is the elevator that fell and took a fork lift down with it".

They thought I was joking.

I wasn't.
 
 
Today I got the revised list of ships available in the James River fleet for non-profit and ship restoration groups. Pretty much the same as last September, the only ship not present is the former USS Kittiwake who was just removed for preparation to become an artificial reef in the Caymans.

BENICIA, Calif.  After years of dispute and delay, the federal government on Wednesday said it would remove a decaying armada from the San Francisco Bay estuary that has shed toxic substances into the water for decades.

The U.S. Maritime Administration, or MARAD, settled a lawsuit and agreed to remove most of the Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet, known as the ghost fleet, a decrepit collection of mostly obsolete military vessels dating back to World War II.

The gray and rust-red ships, some with their hulls flaked with peeling paint, are anchored in rows in Suisun Bay, a shallow estuary between San Francisco Bay and the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.

Studies by the administration have suggested the old warships have dumped more than 20 tons of copper, lead, zinc and other metals into the estuary, a critical habitat for a number of endangered species.

We are moving expeditiously to remove the worst polluting ships first and diligently moving to clean the rest, said David Matsuda, acting administrator of MARAD.

The settlement involving MARAD, environmental groups and state water quality regulators will see half of the ships deemed obsolete  the 25 worst polluters  removed by September 2012, with the rest gone by September 2017. In all, 52 ships eventually will be recycled at various MARAD yards.

The federal agency plans to keep more than a dozen of the ships anchored in the bay  including the iconic battleship USS Iowa  that are in better shape or still considered useful.

Some of the removals have already begun, with four taken out since November 2009.

On Wednesday, tugboats dragged the gray, rusty USS Mission Santa Ynez toward San Francisco Bay. The ship, once a U.S. Navy oil and fuel tanker used from World War II through the late 1960s, was on its way to a dry dock in San Francisco, where it would be cleaned and prepared for the longer journey through the Panama Canal to a recycling yard in Texas.

The U.S. Department of Transportation said it could not estimate how much the removal of 52 ships would cost, but so far, taking out the Santa Ynez and four other ships has cost almost $1.7 million, including costs of dry-docking, towing and dismantling.

Under terms of the settlement, which still needs final approval from a judge, MARAD also agreed to clean up within 120 days piles of hazardous paint chips from the rotting old decks. Each ship will be inspected every 90 days, Matsuda said, and paint chips removed from the deck before being blown into the water.

The San Francisco Bay should never have been a dumping ground for toxic waste. Getting these ships cleaned up and removed is a huge victory for our environment and the people of California, said Michael Wall, lead attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, one of the environmental groups who sued to get the site cleaned up.

Congress had previously ordered MARAD to dismantle the ships classified as no longer useful by 2006, but that never happened. Maritime officials blamed funding and a shortage of facilities for the failure to act on the Congressional mandate.

Still, cleaning up the damage that has already been done is impossible, as Suisun Bay is a tidal environment, so the paint that has peeled off the ships is now mixed in with sediments throughout the bay.

However, environmental groups said removing the ships would keep an estimated 50 tons of pollutants from entering the bay. Current cleanup efforts had already removed 120 tons of debris from the old warships, Matsuda said.

Suisun Bay was chosen by the military as one of several sites for ships withdrawn from active military service. MARAD continues to manage two other ghost fleets in U.S. waters in James River, Va. and Beaumont, Texas.

Over the years, the ships became unusable and too expensive to repair, so they were allowed to rot and pollute nearby waters and wildlife while officials debated what to do about the vessels.

Deb Self, executive director of San Francisco Bay Keeper, one of the environmental organizations that joined the lawsuit, said the ship removal is a key step toward cleaning up the polluted waters of the bay and delta. She said the waterways are key habitat for struggling chinook salmon and the tiny, endangered delta smelt.

This area is a nursery for fisheries in San Francisco Bay and the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, she said. Keeping these toxins out of the water gives these young fish a fighting chance.

That was also in this morning's Long Beach Press-Telegram.
 
 
The Iowa looks out of place in the picture. All freshly painted, clean and taken care of compared to the other ships. She is getting some TLC.
 
 
This has been in the works for years; the problem was jumping through all of the EPA hoops and finding a place to (eventually) dispose of the cracasses. One by one, they'll head across the Bay to San Francisco to be cleaned up, then off to Texas to be broken up.

Maybe not that far. The company that took over the old Mare Island Naval Shipyard is leasing out two dry docks and a few hundred feet of wharf space to a ship scrapping company. If the ships can fit into the dry docks to be cut up, not only will the EPA be happy the work can go faster.
 
 
The former USS Mission Santa Ynez was slated for removal to TX on 3/31, she's the last unaltered/jumbo-ized T2 I'm aware of.

Gone? Really? Seems like the agreement went from "all the old and useless ships will be out" to "everybody out" in just over a week. What happens to ships like the Iowa, Green Mountain State and the ships of the Cape B and Cape G class which are still considered military useful?

 Suisun Mothball Fleet to Be Gone By 2017 | NBC Bay Area 

Suisun Mothball Fleet to Be Gone By 2017

The historic but toxic skeleton crew of ships in Suisun Bay known as the Ghost Fleet or Mothball Fleet will be gone by 2017.

Details of an agreement between The U.S. Maritime Administration, state clean water regulators and environmentalists to remove the Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet were announced Wednesday.

Under the plan, hazardous material will be removed from the 52 ghost ships in four months and paint chipping off the ships will be cleaned within two years.

Twenty of the ships in the worst condition headed for disposal in the first round will be taken from the fleet to a dry dock in San Francisco by 2012 until they head to Texas to be recycled.

The remaining ships will be cleaned every three months to prevent any further pollution. Monthly inspections and water tests will be done on the ships that will be staying in Suisun Bay until their final ending. No more ships will be added to the fleet.

The agreement ends more than two years of legal wrangling between environmentalists and the government over maintenance and disposal of the outdated ships, which have been polluting the Suisun Bay for decades.

"What a difference an election makes," Rep. George Miller, D-Martinez said via a news release. "During the last eight years, virtually no action was taken to clean up the ships, and only a few of the decaying ships were removed - despite clear congressional direction. But today's announcement is a significant step forward. In just one year, the Obama administration has restarted a stalled process, and crafted a plan that will lead to the removal of the worst ships."

Miller, along with Rep. Ellen Tauscher, and Senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein have been active in trying to get the fleet removed.

A federal judge in January ruled in favor of environmentalists, saying the fleet is polluting the bay as toxic paint and other material falls from the ships.
 
 
 
Gone? Really? Seems like the agreement went from "all the old and useless ships will be out" to "everybody out" in just over a week. What happens to ships like the Iowa, Green Mountain State and the ships of the Cape B and Cape G class which are still considered military useful?

 

This?
 
 
unfortunately some very sad looking ships (but great photos just the same)
Thanks for posting!
I to had thought (and expected) that these ships would have been kept in much better condition - then as already pointed out some are WWII vintage, and it would cost a fortune to keep them all maintained

A very interesting topic/subject

Just back from 2 weeks in the Philippines three days ago for a special project. I can confirm that all 4 Victory ships are now gone, along with the Fort Fisher and the Mission Santa Ynez. The Mission Santa Ynez deserved to be pulled as it was the most fouled ship out there due to birds. Dung was literally 4-6" deep on the deck and the insides so fouled it was hard to walk and avoid the bulkheads.

I saw a list for the next 7 to be pulled out in the coming months. Don't recall all of it other than the Pyro and the Monticello are on it. Not yet on the list were the Patrick and the Pope even though they have been closed to parts hunting. To bad as the Pope is a really cool ship inside. The Patrick will definitely need to be pumped empty of water that has flooded the 4th deck mess area as she is listing. As was said there are a lot of recently added ships out there which look to be in brand new condition. Cape Fear, Cape Breton, Cape Borda, Cape Bover, Green Mountain State, Comet, and Meteor to name most.

Last month saw the crew that had a contract to go out and sweep the ships of deck debris. Their contract was up this week and a new crew will be coming out to continue putting stuff in 55 gallon drums. One thing that irritates me about comments is that they are rusting hulks rotting away. Outside of heavy layers of paint peeling and surface rust there is very little rust of the ships structure on the whole. Oh, and of course birds add to the debris considerably. It is a shame that Marad's budget has been cut over the years which allowed the ships to get like this. They literally have had no maintenance at all for years. All of Marad Suisun's tugs are out of action due to lack of maintenance except one. They are also for sale and were originally Navy YTB tugs from Mare Island. Tugs need to be rented for the day to move the ships out now.

The special project below:
 
 
Oh, when I first saw the group of 20 going out to clean the ships I thought they looked a little rough around the edges so to speak. Turns out they were Correctional low level prisoners what ever low level means in California these days.

So does Cal Dept of Corrections have the cleaning contract?

Seems to me that would be a win/win setup.

They probably mean "minimum security" prisoners; cons in for their first time and/or misdemeanor cons. There's an "honor farm" (a fancy way of saying minimum security prison) not too far from where I live, and they typically use the prisoners to clean the highways, etc. Every once in a while you hear about one "hopping the fence" (not too hard to do) and high-tailing it back to Mexico (well, I DO live in the Central Valley!).
 
 
Well for the month they were out there I didn't hear of any drownings...  
 
 
Even more interesting is that the cost for cleaning the ships for the tow out runs $1+ million per ship. At 52 ships it will be at least $60 million to process them. Give us some of that and we can put the Iowa next to the Hornet in Alameda which has been mentioned by some. I'm sure MARAD would be thrilled since they feel the Hornet is in their way with their Ready Reserve ships stationed around us. Apparently they feel that all our visitors driving through the parking lot are a threat to security.
 
 
 
This?

 

Yea...and note that on the bottom of those blades it says "Made in China" - thats where 80% of the recycled steel ends up.
 
 
 
I saw a list for the next 7 to be pulled out in the coming months. Don't recall all of it other than the Pyro and the Monticello are on it. Not yet on the list were the Patrick and the Pope even though they have been closed to parts hunting. To bad as the Pope is a really cool ship inside. The Patrick will definitely need to be pumped empty of water that has flooded the 4th deck mess area as she is listing. As was said there are a lot of recently added ships out there which look to be in brand new condition. Cape Fear, Cape Breton, Cape Borda, Cape Bover, Green Mountain State, Comet, and Meteor to name most.

 

The Cape Fear is a parts hulk for her 3 sisterships in Beaumont which are still in the RRF for the SeaBees, so she might stay somewhere unless she's already been picked clean. The Cape B's are, technically speaking, the most modern cargo ships in the RRF despite being breakbulk, but from what I'm given to understand are in the best material condition, much like the Cape A's located in the James River. I dont see them getting chopped until their cargo tonnage can be replaced.

The Green Mountain State just lost her sistership to the DOD Missile Defense agency as a tracking ship, so I would think she's now little more than a parts hulk. There already are three ACS's next to the Hornet so I think she's done for, especially being the only ship of her class now.

The Comet and the Meteor are as good as gone, despite being the first 2 ro-ro ships in the world.

 
It is a shame that Marad's budget has been cut over the years which allowed the ships to get like this. They literally have had no maintenance at all for years. All of Marad Suisun's tugs are out of action due to lack of maintenance except one. They are also for sale and were originally Navy YTB tugs from Mare Island. Tugs need to be rented for the day to move the ships out now.

 

Much the same in the JRRF, their crane barge wasnt working when I was there last September, but they got a beat-up looking hand-me-down river towboat/crane from the USACE they were trying to get operational. Neither was working when they repositioned the former USS Monongahela and the hired crane they used couldnt lift her anchors from the bottom so she could be re-moored properly. End result: She got loose in a storm and spent 11 weeks aground on the side of the river. Oops  
 
 
I also remember the Cape Gibson and Cape Girardeau. The Gibson was recently sold to Texas A&M as their new training ship. There was rumor that the Girardeau might have been going south as in way south but nothing yet.

Our MARAD crane has worked off and on. Mainly has had leaks in the barge itself that had it out of commission over in San Francisco. The barge and crew used to pull the twin mount gun was loaned to us by Trident or Bay Marine. Can't remember which but whoever it worked out well for us.

After that group of ships from early to mid 2000 we have the group from 1994-95 which is mainly AOR's and LSD's. Then you get to the crappy private merchant marine ships stored there and the WWII built ships. Then a few odds and ends like Coast Guard.

Soon there will be nothing as compared to what I remember from the 70's. Luckily we had the chance to go aboard the Big O in 1990 to snag escalator parts for our ship while she was at Mare Island. On one trip even got to wander into the Oklahoma City to take a look. She was a royal mess but nonetheless a gun cruiser. Best part was when one of the guys wandered off by himself and the rest of us headed back to the carrier. At the end of the day he was nowhere to be found until we saw him waving from the bridge of the Oklahoma City. He got locked in and since this wasn't MARAD property we didn't have a babysitter with keys   )
 
 
Leaving for the breakers.

tbm3, forgive me, this is a little off-subject, but are you involved with the Hornet in some way? Are you a docent? Reason I ask is that I get out to the Hornet at least once a year (sometimes twice) for the youth group overnighter program.
 
 
Not a docent as they don't touch a paint scrapper or paint brush. I have been restoring the actual ship since 1998 with three years of that time spent on the TBM. After restoring Secondary Con and the bull nose I have spent all my time in the Island working my way up from O4 to O5 to O6 and now on O8 till May 26th. From then on I move outside to finish the O6 port side wing before the next rainy season starts. Maybe after my hands become crippled from paint scrapping I might be a docent. Unfortunately O8-O10 will never be open to the general public but as long as I am with the ship all areas are worthy of restoration whether open or not.

This is what O8 used to look like and why I can't stand looking at it this way
 
 
That TBM is a real beaut, it looks like it was time well-spent; I'm glad you guys are keeping it down in the hanger bay below decks away from the elements (though the last time I was there I noticed they put the SH-3 up on the flight deck). Last year, I ran into one of the guys doing the work your doing (he was working on the forward elevator shaft when I saw him), and he was kind enough to take my son & I into some of the spaces not generally open to the public. That's a big ship! This should look familiar:

 
 

Also been on the docent-led tours through the citadel and the CIC and the Admiral's Cabin and all that, very interesting. Looks like you did a good job on the island!
 
 
Keeping it in the Hanger was the original deal. If it was to be put outside I and the Air Group head said they would have a hard time getting it done. Most of the interior of the plane belongs to me when it comes to instruments, radios and O2 equipment. I would not tolerate it being damaged much less put it into the plane. Since the previous COO has finally left the ship, thank God, we no longer have that battle to wage and remind him every year. This is the same fellow who, when presented with the chance of getting Tilly free, he turned it down without consulting the Board or CEO. Oh, and he was an Air Force guy, figures...
 
 
 
Just go to the main site and select the dropdown list on the right to get the current inventory.

I see that this has not been updated for June. Wonder what takes them so long.

Just wondering...is that plane operational? Can it fly? Or is it restored just enough for the visual? It looks great.
 
 
 
Yea...and note that on the bottom of those blades it says "Made in China" - thats where 80% of the recycled steel ends up.

 

Made in Poland on my package.

Ether way, exporting that steel isn't a bad thing.

They have a need. We have a product. Free Market.

Chop them up faster, Just not fast enough to drop the price of the steel.

Could it fly. Well the engine is in good shape and I could probably bring it on line with a few others to help out. However, the ship would not allow me to fire it up if I wanted to test it on the flight deck.

As to flying there are some issues with the upper wing root areas concerning corrosion. Ultimately the folding wings need to be removed so the heavy aluminum sheets on the top center section could be replaced. Once done then the plane could fly as I have found no other corrosion issues with it.

Fly her south above Atlantic Blvd in North Long Beach to start off our Veterans Day Parade on November 6th.

Our theme and grand marshall(s) is ROSIE THE RIVETER. So a couple of B-25 Mitchells, B-17 Fortresses, P-38 Lightnings as well would really be within the theme.

Great job on her. She is a thing of beauty.

Do you know her history?
 
 
 
Great job on her. She is a thing of beauty.

Do you know her history?

 

Yes I know most. Completed January 1945. Reached San Diego June 1945. Reached Guam in July 1945 and placed into a composite squadron. Returned to the States in 1946 and placed into reserve at Litchfield Park for two years. Pulled in 1948 and re-designated Carrier On Board Delivery. Last carrier she flew off was the Coral Sea in 1956 before retired for the last time. Sold to Sacramento Crop Dusters in 1960 for $1.00. Sometime later made her way into the fire bomber fleet in California. Purchased in 1990 by a guy who had a business at Oakland Airport and he flew it into there for storage. Sold to the Hornet Museum in 1998. Unfortunately the owner died of throat cancer right after the sale. In 1999 I was able to go up to his private home, shop and runway below Sacramento to get the gun turret from his wife.

If you like planes then one would have to see his warehouse. The walls stacked with wings, props, and anything else he could hang. Crated piston radials on the floor. His personal F-7 Tigercat and one of the few that flew. A B-23 used by Howard Hughes. An FM Wildcat undergoing restoration. One of the fake Zeros from Tora Tora Tora. In the yard outside two prop airliners.

Down the runway to the next hanger as we heard a hard charging radial above was: A Sea Fury coming in for a landing, four other Sea Furies being restored plus the well known Dreadnought race Fury, and a Corsair undergoing full restoration in French markings.
 
 
For TBM3FAN:

Noticed this item on ebay. Thought you might be interested.

It wouldn't have been 80425, would it? Saw it a few years ago out at Pine Mountain Lake with Clay Lacy at the controls.

And, on a personal note, I should be back onboard the Hornet sometime in October; any chance you might be around then?
 
 
No, it was Eagle's Nest in Ione California. I have a picture of the Tigercat somewhere but I don't think the number is visible. The plane was in correct colors with green stripes at the time.

The more well known restoration place is Sanders which is where I saw all the Sea Furies as the guy has a well known reputation for restoring them.

Below is a link to Sanders and one for Dreadnought

As for October there might be a chance that I would be in the Philippines for two weeks. The other two weeks I would be on the ship as always all day Wednesday from 10-7.
 
 
Here is a link for a time lapse photography of the twin mount 3"/50 cal gun we removed from the USS Tulare. Amy, a photographer, sometimes goes with us to shoot the fleet. She took 685 photos every 2 seconds and put together this slide show. Pretty cool seeing it this way versus being their doing it.

My guess is: none. I expect at least one of the two to be expended as a target, while I could well imagine one carrier to be sunk as a reef...

The first link is the Tigercat as a firebomber in 1963-74. Lists Bogue as owner from 1979-2002.

Second link is from 2006 as she seems to be undergoing her second restoration in the shop I was in down the ways from Mike Bogue's place. He had already passed on and his wife was handling things. I know the Tigercat was up for sale at the time, circa 1999.

 Warbird Information Exchange &bull; View topic - ME-262, F7F, N3N etc. 

Last link I found is of a group of planes stationed at Oakland International in 1983. The Tigercat is there along with a picture of the TBM3E that eventually ended up on the Hornet and in my hands. This thread also had someone commenting on the Bogue Tigercat being used for parts. I hope they are wrong.

Its been a good long while since I have made an update to what the progress is in Hartlepool has been.

Looks like by tomorrow evening there will be none of the ships left visable, with just the keel left of the final vessel.

Some images of the Caloosahatchee being scrapped, becoming the second MARAD ship to complete scrapping.

There is a nice picture of the scrapping of the French Aircraft Carrier Clemenceau with MARAD ship Canopus sitting next to the Clem. This can be found on page 13 of the magazine.
 http://www.operc.com/downloads/PEP/Pepcurrent.pdf 

After this week work will begin cleaning the basin and then upgrading the basin and quaysides.

So after a long drawn out affair, the story for the MARAD ships first towed to Graythorp in 2003. Seven years on and the completion of the scrapping of the MARAD ships is at an end.

It is going to be certainly interesting to see as to what Able UK will bring in, in the coming years ahead.

Hope you find this update useful.
 
 
Thanks for the photos.  
Do you have any idea if Able intends to take more US ships?
 
 
I wouldn't be too surprised if Able did get more ships from the US. As the completion of the ships will open more avenues for work. So now the world is oyster.

I hope he is able to bring some of the big aircraft carriers over that are up for disposal. As I would really like to see them and Able bringing them across is probaly my only way of seeing them. lol

Thank you !

Where is your source for this?
 
 
We asked the manager at MARAD. We always ask what ships are near their pull dates in case we need to get on that particular ship for parts. I'm also pretty sure there might have been something in a Vallejo newspaper as this is a big deal for them at Mare Island.
 
 
Apparently sometime this month or next, T-AO-146 USS Kawishiwi, is to be pulled out and towed down to Long Beach for reefing. Just informed today. Also as she is moved other ships are to be moved about as Mare Island seems to be a go, real soon, for cutting up ships. Just a little more dredging to do. MARAD has been so busy up there, and with her crane down some, the Hornet Crew has been unable to arrange times for picking up stored items and to look for more goodies.

The Savannah, has been getting around years ago she was in Charleston SC, then Norfolk and now Baltimore. Is she on a tour of the East coast?
 
 
 
The Savannah, has been getting around years ago she was in Charleston SC, then Norfolk and now Baltimore. *Is she on a tour of the East coast?

 

Hi surfgun:

From Globalsecurity.org;
"Launched on 21 July 1959, NS Savannah was in service between 1962–1972.*The SAVANNAH was maintained in lay-up status until defueled in late 1971. From 1973 onwards the ship was permanently removed from service, and the nuclear facility was partially decommissioned in 1975-76. From 1981 to 1994 the vessel was bareboat chartered to the Patriots Point Development Authority, Charleston, SC for public display as a museum ship. During that period the PPDA was designated a "co-licensee" for the reactor and exercised custody of the ship - but ownership remained with MARAD."

From Wikipedia:
"*When a periodic MARAD inspection in 1993 indicated the need for dry docking the Savannah, Patriots Point and the Maritime Administration agreed to terminate the ship's charter in 1994. The ship was moved from the museum and dry docked in Baltimore, Maryland in 1994 for the repairs, after which she was moved to the James River Merchant Marine Reserve Fleet near Newport News, Virginia. The fuel in her nuclear power plant was removed upon retirement, though parts of the system that still contain radioactivity are on board."

"The Maritime Administration has funded decommissioning and removal of the ship's nuclear systems. The Savannah had undergone work at Colonna's Shipyard of Norfolk, Virginia, beginning 15 August 2006. That $995,000 job included exterior structural and lighting repairs, removing shipboard cranes and wiring, refurbishing water-damaged interior spaces, and removing mold, mildew and painting some of the interior. On 30 January 2007, she was towed to Pier 23, which is owned by the City of Newport News. On 8 May 2008, the NS Savannah arrived in Baltimore under tow from Norfolk, for removal of the vessel's remaining radioactive material.[3] The Savannah is expected to remain in Baltimore for up to 3 years under a $588,380 U.S. Maritime Administration contract with the Vane Brothers' shipyard at the Canton Marine Terminal in the Canton section of Baltimore."
 
 
The good ship NS Savannah had completely left my thoughts.
Reading about her adventures in "My Weekly Reader" in grade school when she was headline news will provide the synergy to schedule a tour of her during my next visit to the east coast.

Thank you for the update.

 Nuclear Ship Savannah - Frequently Asked Questions 
 
 
Ahhh the NS Savannah, I read about her when I was a kid too, what a great museum she would be, I hope they let people see her powerplant, closest most of us will get to a maritime nuke plant. The minor residual radiation is buried deep inside, behind massive sheilding, with no fuel, there is virtually no chance for an accident if she is reasonably maintained.

Great pictures David, and the naval pictures too, wonderful - I look forward to seeing more.

Are the machinery spaces part of the tour?
 
 
 
Found this thread in a Google search trying to find info on some of the ships I have seen going through the Panama Canal over the past few months. I do not know if you were aware of these before now but here are links to some webcam grabs I took of various Ghost Fleet members passing into the Panama Canal on their way to Brownsville as well as links to pictures taken by a SF local of them in dry-dock for cleaning before they departed SF for their final voyages.

 

Thanks for the links. Have been on all those ships looking for anything of value the Hornet could take and use. The Victory ships had long been stripped when we got on them last summer. The Pan American was downright dangerous inside due to a leak that created a tropical atmosphere inside and rotted the wooden decks of each hold. My only regret was that I didn't carry my tools with me onto the Rider Victory which had a stash of lifeboats in her holds. All built in 1943-44 as evidenced by the solid brass build plates of which I failed to remove some.

The Pope and Patrick attracted both us and the group from the SS Jeremiah Brown during her last year at Suisun. Really got to love wandering the interior of both ships whether looking for stuff or just taking a tour. Other than papers thrown about and asbestos on the deck they were very clean inside when you got down to it. One of these days I need to get my Pope photos up on my site to join the Patrick. Below are a few of the Pope when we visited her the summer of 2010 before she was put off limits in September. I did get the Patrick"s Store hours sign and her Sick Bay hours sign.

There is only a 'viewing gallery' that surrounds on three sides (from above) the secondary coolant loop machinery and control room. You can see this near the final pictures linked here.

 NS Savannah - a set on Flickr 

You do not actually get to go in to the machinery room or control room, nor do you get to see any part (other than the exterior of a portion of the reactor compartment wall) of the main coolant loop or reactor, also seen in those pictures. Along the tour route they did have very large imagery posted of what the inside of the reactor compartment would look like if we could 'see through the bulkhead'.

I would love to see your pictures. Is there a link to your site for the ones you already have downloaded of the PATRICK? I am surprised that there is anything left on these ships while they are in mothballs. I would have assumed they would be stripped bare. Did you get any other items original to the two ships construction?

Here is a link to my Suisun page where she was located:

 USS Hornet CV-12 CVS-12 

What is unique about those two, and which made for limited use for the Hornet, is that the electrical system was DC and the Hornet is AC. There was a lot of unused and barely used electrical equipment just sitting on shelves. Also, not being warships or true Navy ships, they did not have the sort of naval items we use on the Hornet that would be found in CIC, Radio Central, Bridge Engine Rooms and so forth. From the photos you can see there are a lot of small items left all over the ship that we removed especially mess items. Plus there is rope, cable, fie hoses, life vests that may be of use. We did, however, remove some of the Patrick's original small galley items like bread slicers. The one original item that excited me the most was an AE 50 wall monophone, in pristine shape, that was hidden behind a ton of life vests in a deck house. Had been looking for three years for one and every ship had been stripped of theirs except this hidden one.

For the most part their treasures were mild in amount. The true Navy ships really have nothing that you can pick up and carry out. Yet, we use those ships for the big stuff such as lathes, generators, radio panels, phone switch panels, flood lights, antennas and the like. Then there are the ever valuable bakelite sound power phone caps, the little spare fuses on electrical panels and the little indicator lights that I strip out everytime I see them. These are pocket items that I fill my backpack with. The best ships are the USNS supply ships put up there in the 90's. They are loaded with a tremendous amount of good stuff. One ship had enough linens, towels, and bed spreads to supply a good size Holiday Inn. All that is on the Hornet. Machine shops are almost completely stocked with bolts and nuts from #8 on up. Could go on about the items but one really has to spend a day on the ships to see what I am talking about.
 
 
For the person interested in this type of history, this is fascinating! To be able to rummage and browse through a derelict ship like that, that use to be so alive. Even if I were not able to take anything, just to be able to roam and see what there is. Those of you that are able to do this, sooo lucky. I scuba dive, and it's usually the same, look but do not remove anything. My 2 cents.
 
 
I came across the website of  California Ships to Reefs  the other day. As you see, they want to sink all the 1950s oilers and LSDs, plus a couple of buoy tenders off Dana Point to form a sort of diver's paradise. It seems  KAWISHIWI (click for sinking details)  will be first.
 
 
Back, last fall, we took two former crewmen of the USS Mispillion (  Fleet Oiler (AO) Photo Index  ) to their ship for what will be the last time any crew member sees that ship. Their Association would really like for their ship to become a reef rather than cut up.

tbm, is this one of the ships that's usually docked on the other side of the pier from the Hornet ? Last time I was there (last year), there were two or three of these ships berthed right across from the Hornet.

tbm, have you been aboard SPERRY? What condition is she in? She must be the oldest ship still in Suisun bay, except maybe HOGA.

Thank you for posting these photo sets. How is it that you know when to look for these ships transiting the canal?
 
 
 
Thank you for posting these photo sets. How is it that you know when to look for these ships transiting the canal?

 

The first one I ever 'caught', the Victory Ship Winthrop Victory, was completely by accident. I use to always watch the webcams of the locks for hours on a side 'window' opened on my monitor while doing other stuff and surfing. After luckily catching the Winthrop Victory going through I Googled her to do some research on her past and found a photoset taking by a San Francisco 'local' of the ship, which in turn gave me an estimated time frame for her transit from the bay area to the canal. There was a photset of the Rider Victory and I calculated her departure date from the photosets, and two days later she came through right on time. Since then I use the photosets as an 'alert' that they are being prepped and have departed, then keep a look out for the TUG towing the ship on AIS until they appear off the coast of the canal zone. No, I dont have a life   but it makes for an interesting historical record of their final days.
 
 
Good to know. I had seen your sets earlier and asumed you worked for the Canal somehow.  
I used to live in San Francisco myself, but they didn't start towing en masse until after I had moved. Here is a photoset by me of  HORNE (CG-30)  when she was towed out for SINKEX.

I was on CG-34 USS Biddle. Your pictures brought back a lot of memories. Sad to think that some of the ships up in Suisun Bay were still in active service when I was in the Navy. Makes me feel even older....
 
 
 
tbm, have you been aboard SPERRY? What condition is she in? She must be the oldest ship still in Suisun bay, except maybe HOGA.

 

Yes, I have been on the Sperry several times and we have several more times before removing her phone system completely. You're right she is one of the oldest with the Hoga being the oldest ship up there.

These are two that I only had a chance to go on once each in mid 1998 on my first trip to Suisun after joining up on the Hornet. I had no prior knowledge of which ships we were going on but just the information to meet at Mare Island. Of course no camera as I had no digital camera only larger professional SLR's which are a pain to carry along with your backpack of food, water, batteries and then tool chest. The carrier would be self explanatory since she was an Essex and had very useful parts. The second just happen to be open and we wandered in for a brief look see before closed up at 4:00. The part we still recall, with a laugh, was when one of the guys was wandering by himself and when we left the ship and it was locked up he was unaccounted for awhile. Back on the dock one of the crew spotted someone waving frantically from a bridge window and so we needed to find the employee with the keys to let him out. Hey it happens. I always keep that in the back of my mind as I always go down into the deepest parts of the ships on my own. The other guys are a little to old to want to climb down whereas I see a hole I go in. That is how I discovered the parts of the inner hull cut out of the Holland due to radiation. One trip we had 19 people in the group and it was impossible to keep track of everyone and not leave someone behind. Up until then MARAD didn't really enforce the 10 maximum but after that they did.
 
 
Here is one of the Heavy Cruiser USS Des Moines (CA-134) (1948-1961) in mothballs, Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. Dont remember when I took it but it must have been around 1982-1983:

Not a naval man by any stretch of the imagination, but I do enjoy perusing the naval threads. One thing that as always made me curious is, I am amazed at how many ships, boats etc the US has around in retirement, so here is my question...........

What percentage of them could be reactivated if necassary, or are they all scrap metal just waiting to be taken apart? I understand some will be museum pieces.

According to the November report the National Defense Reserve Fleet has a total 184 ships in the 'ghost fleets', only 49 (less than 1/3rd) of those ships in their Ready Reserve Force, most of those (35 of 49) are Roll-on/Roll-off ships. None of the combatants with the exception of the battleships(?), and none of the auxillary/supply ships are listed as in the Ready Reserve Force, all are listed for 'disposal'. The list is of course somewaht out of date as at least 10 of the ships listed in their inventory have already been towed to Brownsville for scrapping, are already scrapped, or are in the process of being cleaned at BAE Systems SF for their final journey.

 http://www.marad.dot.gov/documents/i101130.pdf 
 
 
I think they are kept on the list until the ship breaker confirms in writing the terms of the disposal contract have been met.

What I find interesting is wondering if the US won't miss some of these old ships, if and when, a major problem happens. like in 1939 or 1941. I read the navy was looking at anything (back then) to reactivate or use, because of the threats in the Pacific and Atlantic.
 
 
Most of the stuff being dismantled now are 45+ year old break bulk cargo ships, along with even older single hull oilers. They won't be missed.  

A different question can be fairly asked about the recent SINKEXing of nearly the entire SPRUANCE class destroyers, which probably wasn't the best idea.

Especially all those that had additional armor added to them.
 
 
Additionally, that was a lot of spare parts for the Ticonderoga class!
 
 
 
That TBM is a real beaut, it looks like it was time well-spent; I'm glad you guys are keeping it down in the hanger bay below decks away from the elements (though the last time I was there I noticed they put the SH-3 up on the flight deck). Last year, I ran into one of the guys doing the work your doing (he was working on the forward elevator shaft when I saw him), and he was kind enough to take my son & I into some of the spaces not generally open to the public. That's a big ship! This should look familiar

Also been on the docent-led tours through the citadel and the CIC and the Admiral's Cabin and all that, very interesting. Looks like you did a good job on the island!

 

Should Stick still be reading this thread the TBM just took a big step forward today. Two of our Air Group guys just got back from Idaho Falls with TWO complete sets of bomb bay doors for an Avenger. We have only been looking for 12 years now. We got the two sets complete with hinges and some new ribs. Even better we got two actuators so I can hook them up to the hydraulic system in order to operate them with the pump on manual. The very, very best part was the price...$500 versus $15,000 made to order. Looks like it is time to get the rivet gun and bucking tools out after a long sleep.

Yes, still here!

I'll be on board again in a month or two, hope to see your handiwork first-hand! I'm assuming you'll be keeping her below-decks, away from the elements?

Nice one. What's the tall ship, there?
 
 
On Friday, Dry Dock #3, was flooded in preparation to take their first ship for dismantling. Big day for the Mare Island dry docks which have been empty a long time. Definitely a more cost effective way of dealing with the ships than cleaning in San Francisco and then dragging them all the way to Texas. The first ship set to arrive today, Feb. 2nd, at the dry dock. However, it seems wind conditions have delayed the arrival of the Solon Thurman until the 3rd. Maybe...

THANKS for this great info!!! The only disadvantage is that we dont get to see them either at BAE Systems in SF for cleaning or on webcam through the Panama Canal for their final transit. The tow between the ghost fleet and Mare Island is very short indeed, and these ladies will disappear without us ever seeing it.

Would love to see any of the remaining combantants go through the PC instead of to Mare Island.
 
 
 
tbm3fan, I don't suppose you know what the other three ships are that need to be disposed of this year, do you?

 

I know another is the SS President. There is a row of old merchant ships which are in very bad shape so it would make sense that many of those would be first on the block. Can always ask if I see the manager next Wednesday.
 
 
Just curious. I think BOLSTER and CLAMP must be in pretty poor shape by now too....
 
 
Story at:

 Ship's arrival marks dry docks' rebirth - Vallejo Times Herald 

She was delayed yesterday because of the Coast Guard being notified, late, to do a safety inspection to see if seaworthy. Why the U.S.C.G got notified late no one knows. After she was deemed safe the winds and tide had shifted enough to stop the planned Wednesday delivery. I've been out there enough to know that the tides are a big deal even for us to get the crane out some days.

Concerning the Clamp and Bolester see the story below:

 Thousands apply for 120 jobs at Mare Island dry docks - San Francisco Solano County Buzz | Examiner.com 

Almost forgot. In order to get these contracts and dry docks Allied Defense has to dredge the the route in. How deep they went I don't know but I remember access to the Mare Island Naval Yard was a big deal to another BIG ship.

An old article on the Iowa in one of San Francisco's alternative newspapers from 2007

 http://www.sfweekly.com/2007-01-10/n...ttleship-down/ 
 
 
Built in 1963 as the MARAD type C4-S-58a breakbulk cargo ship African Dawn, this ship served the commercial trades for Farrell Lines Incorporated on the New York - Cape Town route for over 25 years before being eclipsed by faster and more capable containerships. Returned to MARAD in 1988, she was renamed Dawn and placed into the reserve fleet at Suisun Bay for 23 years until departing in mid-January 2011 for Brownsville TX to be scrapped.

Probably within the next day or three.

Unfortunately the ALLIE B with tow went through the far lock and was partially obscured by the AMORITA. They anchored out overnight in Gatun Lake and finished her transit this morning (Feb 7 approx 10:30am) but again went through the far lock and was near totally obstructed by a giant EVERGREEN container ship so no other webcam grabs.

Am keeping my eye out for the SCORPIUS on AIS.
 
 
How long is it taking these ships to make it to Brownsville from SFO? Brownsville is covered over on marinetraffic; I suppose you see them reaching their destination.

Actually once they leave the Panama Canal I stop tracking them, but my best guess for transit time from the canal to Brownsville would be 10 days. I have a point of contact in Brownsville who is kind enough to send me pictures now and then of the ships after they arrive and a couple of their dismantling. I was mostly interested in the POPE and PATRICK due to their history's, the other ships I just get webcam grabs and post in case anyone is interested.
 
 
Things are happening out here that might interest people.

First, Rusty, asked if the Iowa had actually been moved and the answer is no. Row G, which she is in, is unchanged. I'll have to sort out my photos and post one of that row.

Row E has been whittled down to 4 ships. They are the Wyman, Glacier, Sperry and Piro. This row will be going to the breakers in the future. Ten ships are supposed to be pulled this year. The Glacier is sitting in mud with a 25 ton anchor holding her. This will be a very tough move. The Piro and Sperry would be considered large ships.

Row F has four ships with the largest being the Point Defiance. On the outside is the Hoga which is in no danger. The other two ships are small and medium.

Size is an important distinction as it seems some of the smaller ships will be taken to Bay Ship, in Alameda, to be scrapped. Apparently there is a skid there that the ships can be driven onto and then the skid pulled onto dry land. Next a large piece of heavy equipment, with a large scissors, will be used to cut the ships up.

Mare Island will have Dry Dock 2 and 3 in operation. MARAD would like to see ships going there as it would cost 50% less versus cleaning and then sending through the canal. MARAD is becoming concerned about saving money. This has actually brought up discussions about what replaces all these ships. I get back to this.

Row G is not going anywhere at this time with Iowa on one end and the Hughes Mining Barge on the other. Row H is just one barge. Row I is all the newer ships. These are mainly the Cape ships as I call them with the Green Mountain State on the outside. Row J is another single small barge. Row K is another large row of Navy ships which will see a few going from the outside like Vancouver and Holland.

Row L is a row of old merchant ships like the President, Argent, et al. This is where Solon Turman came from. All these ships (6-7) will be going. Row M and Row N are at the far east end where we never go as there are no ships that interest us. Row N is all small ships. I saw a list but it was in the shop area of MARAD so I can't just walk in and we were leaving in 10 minutes anyway. Maybe our lead guy got a copy. I know the Bolester is in this row.

Now the discussion. There is talk concerning the Ready Reserve ships in Alameda surrounding the Hornet. There are maybe 10 there where the government is paying rent to the City of Alameda. The thinking is to move the ships from there and put them at SBRF where there is 24 hour security. Of course all those ships need to be powered from shore for their continually upkeep that I see done all the time in Alameda. The odds of this, I am told, are good this will happen. Hmm, that opens up 3 large berthing spaces next to the Hornet.

Pictures as soon as I can get them reviewed...
 
 
Hi everyone. tbm3fan pointed me to this site when we were out at the SBRF today, so I thought I'd check it out. There's tons of great resources and information here.

Thought I'd share some of the photos I've taken of the ships:

Are you thinking there might be room for other museum ships in the future? A friend of mine is a "plank owner" on the S.S. Jeremiah O'Brien; I wouldn't mind seeing it a bit closer to home at NAS Alameda, instead of out at Fisherman's Wharf. Last time I saw her she was out at Fort Mason.
 
 
Now looking to the west where we are headed over calm waters is Row G.

At the Sperry we are taking her complete phone system to replace the one in the Hornet that was stolen by a volunteer between 1998-99. Yes, we have had some volunteers who have helped themselves to items on the ship. Our phone system was intact, on 6th deck, yet somehow a person removed it piecemeal over a couple of years. When it was time to work on it, as other parts of the ship had priority, much of the switching equipment was now missing. Nothing new as recently one of my personal Navy blankets, in the Captain's at Sea Cabin was stolen, and so I had to remove my other two to the safety of my home.

So we grabbed an 800lb. generator which the Navy removed. Next is all the switches we need and then the lift. Still left if the switchboard and then clearing out the phone system on the Nereus.
 
 
tbm3fan THANK YOu for this wonderful update. I wonder if there are any combatants left other than the USS IOWA there in Suisun Bay? It appears they are mostly support ships.

tbm, what were those ships that are usually docked there? I think one of the docents on the Hornet last year told me they're off-shore refueling ships.
 
 
Nice shots of Iowa. She seems to be holding up nicely minus a few rough spots in the deck.

Over all she is looking good by my trained eye. Her first advantage is that she does not have many coats of paint on her which is the downfall of many of the ships out here. Her biggest issue, as with any ship standing still, is water accumulating in flat areas with no drainage. Without the constant movement of a ship, like rolling in the ocean, the water cannot find an exit. So those places rust away. Gutters, stuffing tubes and so forth. The areas one sees that look nice and gray were painted in 2005. They did a good job as those areas were cleaned of all loose paint and surface contamination. The chalky areas are her last paint job but they are firmly adhered to the substrate.

It is obvious that her whole deck may need to be replaced which is a very big expense. Her entire superstructure will need to be redone which also won't be cheap by any means. As an example, the SS Red Oak Victory had a $1 million dollar contract to do her entire superstructure and she is a small ship. I saw it being done and it was a beautiful job. Paint stripped to bare metal, the metal treated with rust killer, a clear coat applied over that and then her gray paint. The whole ship is one uniform layer of paint. Absolutely beautiful! I hate seeing multiple layers of paint under a new coat which is why I hand scrape every area I work on as close to bare steel as possible. A rough guess would be around $13-17 million to do this work including cutting out rust.

The deck picture below is the same area that was posted above only from August 2009.
 
 
 
Hi everyone. tbm3fan pointed me to this site when we were out at the SBRF today, so I thought I'd check it out. There's tons of great resources and information here.

I wish the first webcam was HD. The second webcam is HD but the ships are almost always too far from the camera to get a decent shot. THANKS for the news link.
 
 
Interesting story. Wonder what they will do when the reserve fleet has no more ships for them to dismantle?
 
 
They probably don't need to worry about that for a decade. It will be interesting to see if the pace of dismantling slows as the ships in worst condition are removed.
 
 
I actually noticed the other day while driving by that there are at least 3 of the old Mk26 Ticonderoga's being dismantled at the Philly yard.
 
 
SS President should be on the way now to Mare Island for scrapping:  Benicia Herald Article .

This  Contra Costa Times  article suggests that a vessel was lost last year when under tow to the breakers. Anyone know what ship this might have been?

As far as I can tell Bill, only a Burke class was dismantled for tow and sinking as a natural reef.
The ones you see forward on Philly side of the bridge I listed in another thread.

Sperry and Thomaston go up for bid the end of this month. We will be hitting both of them on the 30th and 31st for the last time. Ships are literally flying out of Suisun now.
 
 
I don't suppose you have heard anything about HOGA? She has been "waiting for a tow" for a long time now.

More news on activity at Mare Island:  Vallejo's Mare Island shipyard swarms with activity .

Article mentions that:
1. SS LINCOLN to be moved to Brownsville.
2. Mare Island is waiting for the results of the bidding on USS Clamp, SS Sagamore, USS Bolster and Reclaimer.
3. Bids ae being sought for dismantling USS Point Defiance, USS Sperry and USS Thomaston.

They want to dismantle SPERRY at Mare Island since she was originally built there.  
 
 
Has anyone seen a website showing the dismantling progress of these ships (pictures)? A while ago there was a Modern Marvels or similar show showing the dismantling process of some ships at a Texas dismantler. Would be interesting to see this since Suisun Bay is so controversial.

Oh you have to look at Esco's eBay page of items. Lathes for $4500 in unknown working condition and unknown if complete. Sperry gyrocompass repeaters that I have seen all over. The lifeboat oars for the Gen. Pope which I should have taken myself. A coffee maker of the type we were hunting down last month and found 3 of them. To me their prices are worth a good laugh especially so after you look at their feedback and see they don't sell many high priced ship items.

From the Navy Times Story

"Crews are removing asbestos and other hazardous materials from the destroyer in a Philadelphia shipyard"

I worked on DD's 964, 965, 966, 971, 972, 973, and 976. Some numerous times and never found asbestos. ( cough, cough, wheeze, hack, cough )  

I wonder what the contractors are up to?  
 
 
When did asbestos use cease in US Navy shipbuilding?

 Here is a nice picture of the tug ALEXANDRA  towing AMERICAN RELIANCE to Brownsville. She is presently waiting at San Francisco to take SS LINCOLN on her final journey.

In the mid 70's. I know that the Arthur W. Radford was laid down in 1974. Since it was made in the same place as all the other Sprucans I worked on, I find it curious that contractors are "Removing" asbestos from it.

I have issues with the ships being dismantled in Brownsville, TX because I know for a fact that a lot of them had asbestos on them when they got there. I haven't seen anything on their website that showed any large scale abatement before cutting them up. I'm guessing that in a dozen years or so, some residents of the city are going to start having respiratory problems.

Is it possible that the bureaucracy that writes the contracts put in "Must remove asbestos" even if there is no asbestos in the ship to remove?

I don't know. They've used a great majority of the Sprucans as targets in SinkEX and I haven't heard of any asbestos removals on those before sinking.

Well............... there are probably hundreds of 1/16" asbestos impregnated gaskets on steam valves all over the ship, but I doubt that's what they mean when they say "Asbestos."  
 
 
"Asbestos" is one of those hot button terms that seem to create action out of all proportionality to potential impact. I was involved in the dismantling of a beverage production facility, and we found one abandoned hot water pipe that was wrapped in asbestos. Since this pipe was not on the plans we were working off of, the darn project virtually ground to a halt till the full extent of the asbestos was found. The plant was originally built in 1958 and had one major modification in the seventies, along with various and assorted production lines that would come and go with technological innovations. I wonder at times if the threat of asbestos is used to drive remediation when encapsulation would suffice.
I suppose a gasket would be, for the most part, already "encapsulated"?

Asbestos is an excellent insulation and safe as long as it's undisturbed. Problem with asbestos lines around new construction is that workers will carelessly bang into them, hook things from them, do stupid things causing tears.

On the battleships, only enough asbestos was removed so that things could be checked or updated. A lot of problems occurred when other trades, like riggers, would hook cables to the asbestos lines instead of pad eyes in the overhead.

Gaskets are pretty much safe as long as not disturbed, along with old asbestos deck tiles. The correct term for the asbestos in the deck tiles is that they're "non-friable", safe unless someone starts grinding on them.

I don't understand why the lead and asbestos are being removed from ships that are going to be reefed but not on the ships before they're cut up in Texas.

Because the asbestos is removed before the scrapping at the yard commences.

Pointless taking it to one place and get it removed then to another place to get scrapped. As it would cost more that way.

The MARAD ships at Graythorp, Hartlepool, UK had the asbestos removed before cutting began. So I would presume this is the same in other yards

I've seen the pictures out of Brownsville, TX and I know a little about asbestos abatement, so I seriously doubt it......

Back when the Mo came in, we were allocated 27000 manhours to partially remove asbestos off steam piping for inspections and repairs in the engineering spaces. We exceeded the manhours by over 50%, but it was done 100% legal.

On a 5" main steam pipe, the first layer of insulation is usually 5" x 2.5" (Pipe size x insulation wall size). The second layer then would be 10" x 3". Air tools were not allowed to cut asbestos insulation, so the basic hand tools we used were a hook knife (Linoleum knife), serrated knife and end nippers. The stuff had to be sprayed with amended water slowly as each cut was made, but not so much amended water that would leak into the bilges. OSHA would hang an air monitor on a worker and analyze the sample afterwards to make sure there wasn't too much loose asbestos dust flying around during the abatement. After the stuff was removed, we'd have to double bag all of it and then form a line and pass the stuff out from the bottom of the ship to the main deck or pier.

We got cloth coveralls daily for all our work, so we'd go to Safety Issue and check out a "Bug Mask", 100 ft of hose and a "Black Box" (air manifold for two people).

At the job site we'd put on Tyvex coveralls, taping sleeves, collar and pants legs. There would be the plastic "Booties" that went over the steel toed shoes. On the hands would first go surgical gloves, then flash gloves and rubber gloves over that. On the head would be a cloth hood and Tyvex hood over that, then the Bug Mask.

We'd hook up the air manifold to the main air manifold, hook up the air lines, grab tools and go in and cut. Oh, forgot the two gallon water bottles with amended water to put on the asbestos while cutting.  

Good Times...... having to pull the mask off and climb out of the fireroom of the Mo during a full ripout because a dimwit from the Service Shop turned off the air without checking.

Getting suited up then having to climb the vertical ladder with tool bag, air line and manifold of the after funnel of the Jersey, then having to dive in sideways through the double scuttles to get past large drain lines.

Climbing up in the overhead working on a line when my partner thought it would be funny to step on my air line to cut my air supply. I immediately thought it would be funny to try to crush his skull by throwing my steel two gallon Hudson spray bottle at his head. He got off my air line but we had to go get a new spray bottle.
 
 
At Suisun yesterday and today. Couldn't find anything out about the Hoga as someone asked. Manager wasn't around when we were getting ready at 7 am to head out. Targets were the Nereus and Northern Lights. Nereus for her phone system and the Northern Lights for all the items left on her and it was a lot of stuff. I was 30 minutes behind the other guys in my group as I had to go back to my car so I was taken out by myself. Boarded at the HMB-1 and onto the Misipllion to start crossing to the Nereus via three other AO ships. Up the ladder, swing around and run right into Mrs. Goose who had a few things to say but didn't charge. Apparently everyone gives this nest a wide berth except me as I didn't know about it. Across the oilers, with nice clean decks, and onto the Nereus. Wait a second is this the Nereus? This ship is way too clean. Everywhere you look there is no peeling paint to be found. She has been pressure washed and is ready for paint. Down on Deck 4 we have our phone system to take apart for transport to the Hornet. Later we head to the Northern Lights where there is a ton of linens to remove besides electronic and engineering supplies. Saw that the Cape Breton is being painted right next to us. Also learned the Cape Jacobs, by the Hornet at NAS, is coming to the Reserve Fleet on Monday. Saw her crane cables removed last week. After Tuesday, Wednesday and Saturday operating Elevator 1 on the Hornet my lower back muscles and feet are truly killing me. Last shot is my sleeping quarters on O5 Level of the Hornet.

Now if you would buy my book, chapter 11 on HAZMAT gives you all the info. Thanks to Ytlas for providing it. I've had only one problem with that chapter. That's being called on by various Lawyers for more details. At least I found out with a meeting some of us yardbirds had with a lawyer was that the NAVSTA doctor who ordered the testing of every person in the shipyard was named Shelton.

Whether he's still alive today or not, I don't know. Probably got asbestosis from X-raying about 6,000 people.

Problem with yard doctors is they didn't admit to anything. At one of our training seminars with the yard doctors, they showed a film that included "Asbestos Corns" and they stated that there were no reported cases of those in the yard. A few of us just looked at each other. I could have raised either hand with the asbestos corns on them, but the doctors would have dismissed it as something else.
 
 
tbm - So that's what those are? I've peeked into those sleeping quarters quite a few times on my several (overnight) stays on the Hornet. While my Boy Scout Troop is busy earning Merit Badges, I prowl around the ship looking for a space I haven't seen yet (though I will say that I DO NOT go beyond the chained-off areas!). The parts of the ship that are open and those that are closed off change from year to year, so it's always an adventure. Haven't seen #1 elevator working for a couple of years. Last time I was there, they were painting the hanger deck portion of the the elevator bay (this was just before Urban Shield 2009 which, by the way, was pretty cool; got to watch some serious CT action from the deck of the Hornet ).
 
 
 
I don't suppose you have heard anything about HOGA? She has been "waiting for a tow" for a long time now.

 

Have some news on the Hoga. Was at lunch last week with a friend who flew out from Iowa for a funeral. In his working life he was Fire Captain on the Hoga. The Hoga was to go to Arkansas and there was grant money to pay for her from the West Coast to the Gulf and up river. Then Katrina came along and messed up the plans for New Orleans and now the grant has expired. So the Hoga is not going anywhere it seems.
 
 
Thanks for the news on HOGA. I hope she finds a good home soon.

Meanwhile, a contract was awarded to a Brownsville company for scrapping CLAMP, SAGAMORE, RECLAIMER and BOLSTER:  Mercury News article .
 
 
So those four ships cost a 1.85 million contract, $150,000/ave.x 4 to clean and who knows what to tow. So at least $3 million when all is said and done. Did Mare Is. submit a bid that would cost more than that total? I would really like to know. I do know there is no way Mare Island can compete when it comes to facilities and workers. Brownsville drives the ships onto land just like in India to dismantle. Then their workers probably don't cost much more than the workers in India. Those ships may have the obvious toxics removed but all the lead paint remains and no doubt just ends up in the water around the ship in Texas. At least in a dry dock everything is completely contained.
 
 
Oh yeah. I remember as a shipfitter between 1954 & 1964 working with Red Lead, Yellow Chromate and Lead Oxide.

The "old" way we installed passive cathodic protection Zind Anodes was to grind the paint under the hull where the galvanized steel straps from the 24 lb Zinc anodes would be welded to (47 pounders for longer lasting protection). Because of schedule crunch, we normally didn't bother grinding the Zinc off the galvanized straps. Then we would have to trowel on a thick layer of Zinc Oxide too squoosh between the Anode and the Hull while we welded it in place.

When our shift ended both the shipfitter and welder looked like they were caught in an explosion of white seagull crap.

I was highly congragulated on doing one half of the bottom of a Destroyer. Most fitters could only do one quarter at best. Scoggins was the best of all as he could do the entire stern end of a Destroyer in one shift on Swing.

Well, he was a chicken rancher during the day time so having dripping sh*t all over him was a normal day.

Ah! The good old days. And I wonder why I'm still alive after spending three-quarters of a century on this planet.
 
 
Well if you ever worked on any Submarine Tenders then you just might also be a little radioactive. I do remember what you said about bringing a geiger counter. For the old sub tenders or the old shipfitters...?

There might be a scheduling concern. These four are to be pulled in May, but I don't think Mare island will have a drydock free for a couple of months. There's still SPERRY and the two THOMASTON LSDs out for bid...

Oh I have worked on sub-tenders. Installed tons of lead in the Neurius and Sperry for radioactive waste storage tanks.

Proteus was another one I worked on but didn't need to go below 2nd deck. But she is an amazing history lesson of the progress of ship construction. She started off basically as an all riveted ship. Then she was jumboized 44 feet amidships with a welded hull insert. Early aluminum deckhouses were installed by riveting them to steel coamings with stainless steel hot rivets. Later aluminum deckhouses were installed on steel coamings with Huck Bolt "Pop" rivets. The last aluminum deckhouse (that I designed) was welded to a steel coaming whith bi-metallic metal as the joint (steel on the bottom, aluminum on top and fused together with Ammonium Nitrate and fuel oil controlled blast).

Talking to our guy in charge of aircraft and volunteers to see what was up with our F-4 Phantom and when we are going to get an operational F-18 he brought out this piece of naval equipment to see if two of us could identify. Believe it or not it was going to be dumped as we had several clueless people on our ship who did stupid things like that. The thinking was it wasn't for our ship so let's just throw it away. We had bad COO, who didn't like me at all since I told him to get off the ship one day, who turned down the donation of a 100% operational Tillie that a contractor had in Alameda County. Not many people happy about that and the fellow above wasn't here at that time. He was here when this item was to be dumped and he saved it. He has also told us to strip the ships in Suisun of anything and everything now.

So can anyone identify it based on the photos. The build plate is a dead giveaway as I knew what it was the moment I saw it. I'll save the build plate for one day. Here are the other four.
 
 
The only clues I can see is that it was used for range finding, azimuth & elevation of a gun system. Hmm. 550 mils is 45 feet - 10 inches at 100 yards. The rear sight of my M-1 Garand won't go that far. so it must be for a bigger gun.
 
 
Gotta be for a 16"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun. Is it possibly from the Iowa ?
 
 
Looks like some parts of a Rangekeeper Mark 8.

If it was I am sure Dick would be breathing down my neck about it      

Fortunately it is not from the Iowa. I do know the particular ship it came from which no one else would probably get but one might have a 1 in 3 chance of getting the class. One hint from the tag is Mark 6 Model 22. That should keep googlers busy for awhile. The stuff in fine print on the tag is a dead giveaway and I'll put that pic up tonight.
 
 
Well, Mr. Google suggests that this object is part of a 40mm Bofors gun director.
 
 
IMO, Since your dealing with the Reserve Fleet and outside of Iowa herself nothing as big as 5" as far as I can see im going with either 40mm up to 3"/50's FC component. It's obviously dealing with a simplified FC solution judging by the inputs and nothing as complex as a 5"/38 FC.
 
 
Don't jump to conclusions based on how old you might think it is as you could get mislead.

Hmm, where did you guys get the 6"/47 FC computer or is it a leftover from a former WWII CL Guided missle conversion? These are the only ships I know that carried the 6"/47.

So, you have had it since 1999 or before. Storage or display i assume?

Or possibly stuffed away in a remote corner of the Hornet just waiting to be discovered?

As I said earlier we had two people on board who could be incredibly clueless. The former COO and our supposed head of restoration but don't ask me how or what he even knows. This was to be put into the dumpster awhile back before the guy in charge of the volunteers saw it and saved it. He does not believe in throwing anything away no matter what. If it is not part of our ship he will use it in trade which he has done many times. Hopefully we will pull another 3"/50 cal twin mount and then he will use it in trade for a 40mm quad Boffers. On the other hand, our COO who thought planes only took up space, turned down a completely operational Tilley that was free for the taking. Never even passed it by the board but simply turned it down on his own. Luckily he didn't know about all the Navy work clothes we accepted from Moffit that is stored on 3rd deck in the CPO quarters. Boxes upon boxes upon boxes.

Oh, the FC computer is stored in a storage room on the 2nd deck next to the Head of Volunteers Office.
 
 
Evidently SS LINCOLN is in such poor condition she cannot be towed to Brownsville. SS PRESIDENT will therefore be taken out of drydock and sent to Texas whilst LINCOLN is dismantled at Mare Island:  Times Herald article .

RECLAIMER and SAGAMORE are to be pulled over to San Francisco for cleaning. The other two should follow next week.

Meanwhile, a group of urban explorers have posted up pictures and an account of sneaking onto Suisun bay ships in the dead of night and spending the weekends in different ships taking photos:  Adventures in the Abandoned Ships of Suisun Bay .
 
 
You could literally say the shit hit the fan with this discovery. When the Navy turned this up in a web search, as they routinely do, they contacted the Dept. of Justice. The Justice Dept. contacted MARAD in San Francisco who then contacted the manager at Suisun. Naturally they wanted to know what the hell was going on. The Justice Dept. also call the Hornet. The next thing I know was our visit for the first week of May is canceled until further notice. Needless to say there were a lot of unhappy people around. There was also to be a show on May 7th in San Francisco regarding these ships  Scott Haefner Photography  which is the site first discovered.

There was some concern that the manager at Suisun might lose his job over this. I know not all hatches have pad locks on them and you only need to check each and everyone. Some are wired shut from inside while others have nothing. You can get into the Thomaston if you can get to the very front of the ship were there are two doors, port and starboard, and the port side is open. It was open when I first ran across it as I followed a water leak. Our man at the Hornet had several talks with both the Dept. Of Justice and the Dept. of Defense. We seem to be ok now. One person, who had permission to go with us, withdrew from the show and probably will never be allowed to go with us again. Several people on the Hornet feel they were used. Jon I know was with us once that I can recall. The others I don't know and obviously were the ones to sneak out there. I have a pretty good guess what stoked their interest in sneaking out there given the time frame.

Our guy on the Hornet told me we were cool with MARAD on this past Wednesday. He is working on a secure procedure for ship members being up there not that anyone sneaks into our group. I have heard anything that might happen to the three guys who did sneak onto the ships and admitted trespassing onto a restricted government site.
 
 
I was amazed to see a thing like that posted using the guy's real name. There are many more stories of trespassing in all sorts of buildings on that site. What is it you think "stoked their interest" if you can say? The impending scrapping of most of the ships they visited?

Meanwhile, daver6 has posted up a  nice photoset  of RECLAIMER and SAGAMORE arrive for cleaning. I never realized just how small SAGAMORE is....
 
 
Look at his main page right here under update. That is where my guess comes from in that he saw photos taken 2 years ago and after that their interest was heightened.

Really makes you wonder, doesn't it? They knew someone else had received permission to go and take photos, yet they anyway felt the need to sneak on board the ships illegally in the dead of night. Guess that is part of the 'adventure'. I especially like the line about them 'vanishing into anonymity' as they drove away for the last time. Then they go and post all the photos and stories under their real names....  

They are nice photos though. Shame they had to get them this way....
 
 
We are still on hold. Initially MARAD was blaming us for leaving hatches open which was never true. Many of the ships those three went into we had no reason to go in ourselves. So that part has been cleared up so right now we are waiting while Justice decides whether or not to prosecute the three since they spelled everything out in their pdf file.
 
 
I hope you guys can get back soon. World War II vintage ships are going fast. Yesterday BOLSTER and CLAMP were pulled out to have their hulls cleaned:  Daver6 photo .

I find it somewhat amazing that CLAMP was decommissioned in 1947 and then spent more than sixty years sitting in reserve!

Speaking of older ships I have heard from a reliable source that the Ranger IS going to Oregon and the JFK to Rhode Island. We already know the Iowa is going to San Pedro only everyone is waiting for the official announcement. I hope they do ok and keep their forecasts in check because, like the one below from the Ranger, I seem to have heard it before and it didn't pan out. These smaller venues might be paying too much attention to San Diego and the Midway rather than the Hornet and Alameda. The visitors might be a stretch but I don't think those numbers of $46 million and 536 jobs are realistic at all. I will say that bringing the Ranger all the way up the Columbia to Fairview will definitely be a sight to see given the difficulty of the passage.

"Ranger will be an important educational resource and serve as an emergency preparedness center capable of supporting the entire region. Studies show Ranger's economic impact will push 46 million dollars a year into the local economy and 536 direct and indirect jobs with 350,000 visitors a year to the ship."

Norway has decided to scrap the remains of the Sverdlov class cruiser MURMANSK. The ship ran around and sank off Norway en route to the breakers. Evidently, various nastiness such as PCBs and the like were discovered aboard her and so Norway has decided to break her up.

Surprising. That ship broke loose and wrecked in their waters years ago. The Russians should have been responsible for the salvage of it from their waters but I guess if its polluting their (Norways) waters which it is in then the sooner the better. I hope atleast they are being compensated for it where its not known if the deal they just made over boundries to islands with Russai has anthing to do with it.

Novel way to break a ship !

Just build a coffer dam and send the wreckers.

If it weren't for the PCB's imaging the attraction for divers in the crisp clear clean & extremely cold water of Norway.....

I agree; I assume Norway will keep whatever proceeds she gets from the scrap (assuming it's usable) as partial compensation for having to clean-up Russia's mess.
 
 
I sort of hate to see it scrapped. It was one of those cool shipwrecks. No doubt it's a bit of a navigational hazard though.
 
 
The Suisun Bay urban explorers are featured today in the  Daily Mail . No mention of whether or not they have been arrested.
 
 
What splendid writing, eh chap? These ships fought in WWII. Really? Only 3 were in use during WWII and all three are auxilliary ships not to mention the Coast Guard ships, all the private merchant ships, AORs, and the dozen of new ships from the last 5 years. The Hornet crew is still on hold until Suisun MARAD gets their security situation under control. We are still not amused...
 
 
Did you look at his blog again? Plenty of people ranking them out for what they did. It is amusing to see the fellow deny that they committed breaking and entering because they didn't physically 'break' anything. Guess they should have seen a lawyer first....
 
 
They took some decent pictures though. I'll give them that much.
 
 
Sure, but they could have taken them legally, as a previous photographer did. They lamely claimed that they 'wouldn't get through the bureaucracy in time".
 
 
The only thing that would concern me is them entering ships dehumidification barriers and wrecking the work those men do to keep certain ships preserved while there and souvenier hunters.

Since this is California. I would also expect a law suite if someone gets hurt or killed while sneaking around at night out there and no doubt it wont be the intruders fault as always.  
 
 
The guys are probably guilty of Criminal Trespassing.

If the guys defecated on board or left trash, who knows what charges they'll add?

I'd ask my brother (An attorney for 31 years) but there's never
a quick answer to a law question.
 
 
Fortunately the only ship up there that has a dehumidification system running, and a ship that they would want to get in, is the Iowa. Luckily, there are very few access points into the Iowa. Then outside the newest ships put there in the last 8 years there are no others with working systems. Those ships are the ones that had hatches that were supposed to be wired shut from inside if they didn't have a padlock. I can attest that some wired shut hatches were no longer wired shut as someone in MARAD went out through them and didn't reattach the wire.

Yes, it is one and the same...

What a pompous *sshole Haefner is. They are trespassing on Government property, entering spaces on the ships that are often off-limits due to deteriorated ladders and expanded metal decking, publishing unauthorized photographs, ---- well, I could go on and on.

Here is another article on the Suisun Reserve Fleet written by Bob Fish, trustee of the USS Hornet Foundation, that appeared this month in Alive Eastbay. I was told today that the cover shot for the magazine is the USS Iowa. I'll wait to see if true when it shows up in my office.

Iowa is on the cover.

I have a copy for you Rusty after going next door and getting their copy.

The never completed oilers BENJAMIN ISHERWOOD and HENRY ECKFORD will soon be on the way to Brownsville:  Maritime Professional story .
 
 
Thought these two part completed oilers were contracted for scrapping at Able UK in Hartlepool, UK. After the deal for 13 ships was renegotiated for the 4 already in the UK and then the 2 uncompleted oilers in the MARAD fleet.
 
 
The article implies that that was cancelled for Byzantine political reasons....
 
 
it is the Clinton era; are you surprised?
 
 
Hey RustyBattleship. Wasn't the Glomar Explorer parked there for awhile? I think Transocean bought it, I wonder where she is now? When I was a kid the Ghost fleet used to be enormous rows and rows of destroyers heavy and light cruisers and Liberty and Victory ships.

Hello All,
Can anyone enlighten me as to the fate of the PATRIOT STATE (formerly SANTA MERCEDES)? According to official sources (Lloyd's Register) she was broken up 21st September last year. I've combed the internet but can't find any evidence. I believe she had been laid-up at Fort Eustis.
 
 
The maritime commission web site only has its reserve fleet listing through may of this year. see below for link.

I have no idea of what happened to the Glomar Explorer. Nor the Glomar Challenger either. For some reason, even after the real purpose of one of them was made public, I only had a passing interest in them.

Probably just as well with the intense involvement I have had with the Iowa class museum ships after I retired. Sometimes my wife claims I have TOO much of an interest. Would she rather I downloaded photos of young babes in string bikinis?

Hmmmm. Now just where was the link to that last --- uhhh, never mind.
 
 
Glomar Explorer is now the GSF Explorer and she is currently off Indonesia drilling for oil as she was converted to a deep sea drilling rig.
