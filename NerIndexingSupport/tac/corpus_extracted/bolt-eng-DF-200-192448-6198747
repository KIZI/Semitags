Various polls I have read lately have revealed an alarmingly (yet not entirely unexpected) high incidence of anti-americanism in the UK.

What is your view of the USA, given that America is different than Geroge Bush?

Personally, I think that the anti-american backlash could be one of the most dangerous effects of the war in iraq for Britain. Whenever I see those 'no. 1 terrorist' stickers with bush's face i fell like slapping a sticker of bin laden over the top.

In my opinion the UK and USA are deeply culturally and politically linked, and we mustmaintain our 'special relationship' (excuse the cringe-worthy phrase)
 
 
I dont mind the iraq war or any of that *******s in this context. I just dont like the general ignorance and self importance that americans place on themselves. Bowling for Columbine pretty much sums it up for me. Its a shame, my mum thinks the US has some great parts, but im so repulsed by it in so many ways, i dont think i ever want to go there.

The way they think a good american should be christian despite the fact the US is supposedly a secular nation. The way they have this 'us or them' mentality towards foreign policy. The way they sentimentalise things like columbine without actually doing anything to prevent such things from taking place.

But i love some of their films and music and i'm generally glad for the impact they've had on the world and i think we'd probably be worst off without them. But still, i look forward to the rise of a new world power to replace it...
 
 
Culturally speaking the US is a very diverse place, which I think is great; there are some very liberal streams of thought and behaviour as well as some very conservative ones - and everything in between.

But, yes, Bush is a moron who has sent brave soldiers to die for a lie (the WMDs that we were told would be found, but never were).

Oswy.
 
 
America offers you endless top ups of coffee in places like IHop and Waffle House and gives you a choice of paper or plastic in grocery stores so it can't be all bad.

Yes. "Bend over and grab your ankles Tony - here comes Georgie boy - now who's your daddy?"
 
 
Hrm...interesting. I fit in with the profile of what most people would call an 'anti-american', but I don't think I am.

I don't like what the USA is doing in the world at the minute, but then again, I don't like the system that the majority of the world works under either, so I guess that would that makes me anti-German, French, etc.

And there is, of course, the string of American ex-girlfriends that litter my personal history. Sleeping with the enemy, maybe?  
 
 
I think anti-americanism is still quite trendy throughout the world today, mostly due to Bush's 7 year string of **** ups.

That said, people in some areas (read: Iran and Iraq) are more than glad to chant and burn stuff even when America isn't involved.

Yea, thats why I hate the expression.

It could even be used as a ephemism in every day speech.

"oh yea, we have a special relationship, you could say he's my Geroge Bush, if you know what I mean"

Playing behind enemy lines, penetrating the labia of justice and spewing information over the face of those who entertain his company, alasdair - spy extraordinaire.
 
 
It often strikes me as odd when people lambast the current US administration and create Bush as some untold evil the western world has ever witnessed. I think can also name a few other US presidents who sent hundreds of brave solidiers to their death because of false policies and ideologies. Somalia under Clinton? Vietnam and LBJ? Korea with Truman?

People have to understand that bad foreign policies and the futile death of innocent civilians and solidiers did not begin with GWB. Nor will they end.

I think the fact that we have been roped into another one of these proxy-wars with the US, means that anti-american feelings are going to be somewhat high, although mostly shallow and devoid of any real substance.
 
 
Hey, I posted that I like america but not its gov! lol my family live there too... anyways!

Im horrified to find out that my boss discriminates against americans!!!!!

She does not like them at all!
shes horrible about an american woman that I work with, she makes out like they are stupid and she gets really tetchy if I mention america, She said why would she want to take a holiday in america when she can go to whitby! Im sorry but can you compare america to witby and am I right to be offended by her?!

Anyone else got a new found desire to become a spy after reading this post?
 
 
not really a fan of america. their dramas are good...
but everything they do seems to be in the pursuit of money...they also waffle on about being land of the free and democracy and blah blah the constitution blah as though Western Europe doesn't exist, and personally, when a country has the death penalty, tortures detainees and legalises guns, i don't think we can call them truly civilised.
plus, the 'liberal' thinking seems to come from these up their own arse places, like LA and san francisco, and all the hollywood types who talk about the gvt and corporations and how terrible pro-war americans are, despite the fact that they're the poster children for capitalism, spouting all this crap from their million dollar homes.
american tourists also seem a bit gee-whiz and noisy.
but i'm sure this doesn't apply to all americans, i'm sure there are many nice ones  
 
 
I voted for the third one.

I'm quite jealous that they actually have a constitution.

Obviously that's an arguably unhelpful amendment. But still, I'd prefer a written constitution, so I wasn't arguing to have the US version. We're one of only three countries remember.

Anyway, the Magna Carta is hardly brilliant too given its anti-semitism in places.

So, both have their bad points.

Most people just hate America because it's trendy. Personally, I think the Bush administration hasn't done too good a job, and there are certain areas and people within the country who (culturally) I can't stand, but the majority of the country I don't have a problem with.

well i was mostly referring to the fact that it established freedom, which is what the american constitution is meant to do.
i didn't know about the anti-semitism, i haven't read it really.

Look at the first amendment, that does pretty well.

Our freedoms are mainly conventions and traditions- I'd hardly call that as much a guarantee as the US'.

Are you really going to sing the praises of an 800 year old anti-semitic document, over half of whom's clauses are entirely irrelevent in modern day society?
 
 
We do have the European Human Rights Act, which must be effective at something given the amount of whinging it provokes.

The Magna carta was an important early step in democratic history - flawed though it is it was the first time the British were granted any sorts of rights against an absolute monarch.
 
 
It needs a better appreciation of cricket and better real ale.
 
 
I went through a huge Anti-American phase about 6 months after I moved here, and curiously enough, now that I'm going back to Blighty in 6 weeks I think I'm going to quite miss the place.
I will miss Aint Jemimas cinnamon toast, Nick at Night and Barns and Noble.

I like America, but I got a false impression of it from previous trips to Washington (ultra friendly and chilled) and Miami. I ended up in NY, and rapidly found ouit that it is London with Tourettes. I wont, miss the arrogance, the shameful lack of employment protection, and the back stabbing that this work environment promotes, or the total unawareness that any other country apart from the US exists. I also wont miss the crappy weather in NY where you feeze your arse off for 9 months of the year and then burn in the fires of hell for the other 3. I am presently sitting in my apartment and can see where the police have cordoned off the corner of FDR drive because a lamp post blew down in the Nor Easter. Blighty has been in the mid 70's all week and it is rough.
I have no great problem with their politics, any more than I have with Britain, but living here can be a pain in the arse, especially NY men who treat a date like a job interview, the superficiality "Oh have a nice day and you take care now and please if you are passing listen to my entire life history" and then the next time they see you they look right through you. The fact that you cant make friends through work and that you are expected to tip everyone exorbitantly for crap service. I cant wait to get taxis again where the driver doesnt spend the whole time screaming obsceneties and talking on his hands free and then expects a $4 tip for going 10 blocks.

And by the way, I offered a plumber a cup of tea, like you do in Blighty, and he looked at me like I was mad. Why is brewing up for trades people not done in America?

Edit: Why is there not an option to vote "I like America but I dont like Americans", or I like Americans but I dont like America". I tend to veer between the two without the government coming into it.

oh bloody hell, i'm not singing its praises, it was just an off hand comment that amounted to "i'd rather not live in America, thanks".
all i know is it established democracy. Like that person said ^ european human rights, which includes the abolition of the death penalty (i've said it once and i'll say it again - it's a requirement of a civilised nation).

Oh, I'm not for a moment calling America "civilised".  
 
 
Honestly, for all the comments about hating the "percieved arrogance" in America, I see an awful lot of it out in the open on here bring spouted by Brits  
 
 
America is hugely Christian, and half are YE Creationists.

I certainly wouldn't call that civilised.

i always hear this argument. i can't see much written about arrogance ^.
just saying, i can name a good few countries i would rather live in than ever living in America if i wanted freedom. Western European countries, Australia, New Zealand and Canada a million times over.
 
 
Not just in this thread, it comes up everytime someone mentions America. It basically looks a bit like this:

What I find arrogant is the persistent assertion of being a free society and not having a class sytem etc, when their only experience of the British class sytem is watching Pride and Prejudice at the movies. I also get extremely tired of the defensiveness from some quarters about the Revolution and the whole "You Brits think we're dumb Americans" etc. Admittedly that usually comes from upper east siders who have never moved from the parental home but there are just as many misconceptions held by Americans about other countries as they hold about the US.

And for all the anti-American viewpoints on TSR, there are an awful lot of people that want to come here to study.

I don't like nor can i fathom how extreme America is, for example on an American wifeswap they had people who visisted art galleries and museums and then the people who they were swapping with ate raw meat and lived waaay in the middle of nowhere and were stocking up for a apocalyptic disaster. You just dont get people like that in the UK. The worst we have is the BNP handing out a few objectionable leaflets, then in America the KKK prance around in silly robes burning things.

There are 5,000 Klansmen in the US. The BNP got 200,000 votes.

I saw a programme on White Nationalists in the US where this family had these two angelic twin 11 year old girls preaching racist filth, dubbed Ashley and Mary-Kate Goebels by the US media.

I'd rather be closer to the US than to Europe. But I think in the same way that Europe is dim wittedly Socialist, America is dim wittedly capitalist and right wing. I think they dont really appreciate that the world is slightly more nuanced than they think, but try to point out things arent black and white and they think you a ditherer compared to their righteousness. In the long term though that mentalitiy is hurting themselves.

I dont have a problem with Americans being arrogant, i'd be arrogant if my GDP was the same size as Europe's. But whats dumb is that they base their arrogance on a half concieved view of a) themselves and b) the rest of the world. Its stupid becasue even if they did have a more accurate picture of themselves and everyone else, they could still be quite justifyably arrogant.

Its like America is still acting like a teenager, being overly matcho and trying to assert its dominance, when in reality its a fully grown man and doesnt need to act so immaturely, becasue its already dominant.

Mush's reaction to the Virginia shooting
Pathetic.

Americans are killing hundreds of thousands of innocents and guilties all over the world. And they're doing it everyday.

Yet you don't hear the faintest of whispers about that in the news. But the minute a few of their own flock take a bullet they start whining and seeking sympathy.

I have no sympathy for it. If they're going to be a power mad nation who's entire existence revolves around power, weaponry and ego then this is what's going to happen.

Not talking about TSR- just about the Americans I've met here in the US. If the Americans I'd met in real life were as even handed as the ones on TSR I might have had a better time here. See my thread about how we'd be speaking German if it werent for the Americans. Notice how well argued and even handed you, Bismark etc were, as compared to the idiot who said it in the first place. I despair at knee jerk anti-Americanism as I prefer Americans to most of Europe any day. But I also object to rants about about how "we kicked your asses out in the revolution". One idiot even told me that "noone cares about Tony Blair and the British because the French had helped them gain independence"! This is ridiculous in light of the make up of the allied forces in Iraq.

Where do you meet these people?   We live in the same city, right? If anything, everyone I know here is reflexively anti-American, rather than the opposite...
 
 
Ya, sadly there is no denying that a portion of our population honestly couldn't find France on a map. I just don't like it when us Yanks are lumped in with that Confederate riff-raff

Jewish singles events. They are the worst and I'm not going anymore. I think the people you are talking about are on the UWS or in the village. The UES and East midtown are full of Republican princes and princesses, who like I say, still live with their parents. I made a bad real estate decision.

What can I say? There are ignorant people everywhere. Americans get ripped on for not being able to find countries on a map, but what % of non-Americans could identify more than California, Texas and Florida?

Not many I'm sure. In fact, one of my friends from home didnt know the difference between Staten Island and Long Island. That is even more inconceivable, especially if you forked out for a house in Nassau county.

Yeah, my sister is at CUNY, and ended up studying Arabic and buying a keffiah, no joke! Mind you, the people I met at Jew do's were usually city types, obsessed with making money and who is going to advance their capitalist causes. Students are more open minded.

I imagine it would be very low. At my last job I repeatedly had to identify Illinois and Georgia on a map of the US. Let alone the shock I experienced when a coworker told me he thought that New Jersey was north of New York State. Then again, someone at the firm with an Oxbridge degree tried to schedule a meeting with someone in Houston, when the person lives in Dallas. He didn't realize that they are several hundred miles apart.

I cannot believe you think service in the US is bad. I have never been in a country with worse customer service than the UK, except maybe Tanzania. My British relatives always comment on how friendly people at American shops and restaurants are. In Britain they act like you are ruining their lives by actually wanting service. Then again, it seems like British people enjoy needlessly standing in queues, perhaps I'm the only one bothered.

Maybe it's because in the US the waiters/waitresses make most of their money on tips so it's in their interests to provide good service?

Besides, good service is hardly universal in America just as bad service is hardly universal in Britain. A friend of mine and his family had a really bad experience in Boston at a TexMex place. The food was awful and the service worse, so they refused to tip. They were told it wasn't optional and that the police would be called if they didn't tip.
 
 
That's just, frankly, dumb; why not simply put 10% on the price and say "service included" like everybody else does?
 
 
If getting a tip and its size are unaffected by the standard of your service, there is no incentive to try any harder or at all.
 
 
I strongly dissaprove of America's foreign policy. I disagree with much of it's domestic policy, but that has nothing to do with me as it doesn't effect me and it's their choice in the end of the day. But their interventionalist capitalist foreign policy makes me  . Having traveled across America, I have to say that Americans are very friendly and polite people in general. Although some aspects of their cultures i see as undisreable; guns, the strong christian influence, the american dream and the strong belief in the free market economy and rising and falling on ones own merit.

I have to admit though that even their ultra hard line capitalists are charming; I think it was Janice Brown (a potential supreme court nominee at one point), who described minimum wage as evidence of a socialist revolution.

Oh and their ignorance and intollerance for other cultures and views is sometime annoying. Espescially about Islam and left wing views,
 
 
How can people be saying service in America is friendly, it counts for nothing when the general attitude is dog eat dog and so socially vicious.

In all fairness, that's entirely forgivable compared to not knowing where entire countries are. Major countries, often not even getting the continent right according to most studies and sources.

Not knowing where half the states are (in the USA) is perhaps comparable to not knowing the configuration of the Australian or Canadian states and territories.

Though I do take you're point.

I hate that. It's so incredibly annoying. If I want to tip I will, but they have to work for it. If they want to increase their staff's wages just do so and hike the price. In the past I've deducted the service charge, scribbled the new total on the bill and told the manager to like it or lump it. He was so shocked that he didn't complain. Though I've never been there again.  
 
 
America and UK are so much alike. I dont think people should be anti amercian. If our country got into trouble, guarenteed USA will be the first ones to come and help us. Plus Tony Blair licks George Bushes ass
 
 
 
what % of non-Americans could identify more than California, Texas and Florida?
 

To be honest with you, i probably know the locations of states and large cities within them in the USa better than i do the location of loads of counties and cities in Britain. I didnt know Warwick was by Birmingham untill like 2 months ago. I also used to think durham was more north than Newcastle untill i actually looked at a map the other day.

But at the same time, regardless of the fact that many states are the size of countries, its the fact other countries are soverign nations that makes their location more important than the location of a state. what amazes me is the geographical ignorance of the middle east. If people simply knew the countries Iraq borders, you could realise why there are so many problems.

I forgive America its many transgressions (what state hasn't done something wrong) with the exception of the gun laws and the rampant coming together of Church and State. Both of which are the result of the going against of the constitution and the values the USA was founded on.
The 'founding fathers' clearly said that there exists no relationship between church and state and they must be kept seperate, yet looky what we have, a bunch of nutter religious blokes voting in the daddy of all religiously motivated pillocks - who ends every awful announcement with "God Bless this or that, We are one nation under God" and then actually SUPPORTS the teaching of Intelligent design in schools! Piss off!

Now to the gun laws. The constitution says something along the lines of "there is a right for the milita to bear arms against foreign invaders".

That means the army.
It doesnt mean every yee-haw moron and drug dealer can have one. But oh well, ignore that and create a rate of gun homicide that makes the average European wince.

Other than that though, I can't criticise, because I can find similar complaints in all states.

They have triggered a global arms race as every small nation tries to get nuclear weapons to defend themselves against the US.

One thing that get to me about American culture is the excessive patriotism. It just seems like one big competition to be the most "patriotic", buzzwords like "un-American, and "anti-American" is thrown at dissenters with little meaning or context, just as a way to belittle the other side.

Plus the American right-wing in general. Take  this  tool for example. As much as I disagree with the British right-wing they could never stoop to the level of the American.
 
 
Yeah, the excessive patriotism is a bit of a joke. Again, it expresses a sort of insecurity that America doesnt even have to have.

Its fantastic how people discount a film they probably havent seen. If you had you would realise it simply states facts. but no, any criticism of the US, NOT ALLOWED! He's not even religious!
 
 
America's ok.

Why are people acting as if we're suddenly not allowed to like countries and that there's something wrong in doing so?

The atom was first split in Cambridge, that might be what you're thinking of; I believe the first fission reactions were also done in the UK too but I'm not sure. The Manhattan project was a collaboration between UK and American scientists to develop the first nuclear bomb.

Well there are an awful lot of British people running around the US with smiles on their faces at the moment:

Nigel Lythgoe
Simon Cowell
Piers Morgan
Cat Deeley
Posh and Becks
Heather Mills McCartney

I think they are swayed by the fact that you don't have to be a millionaire to have several cars and live in a detached house.
 
 
Actually, I think Shady Lane symbolises the type of person some British people get a bit sick of.

For the record, I dont have anything against you lol.
 
 
What kind of person is that? An American who has a high level of international knowledge and awareness and has moved to the UK?

True. They are hiding their money from the naughty Labour government.
 
 
No. From the posts ive seen of yours, Britian sort of a cute little quaint cousin you can rightfully look down on. I've seen you argue to the death the superiority of everything American over British, especially in regard to the education system.

But as i said, i dont have any problem with you at all.
 
 
I criticize America too. However, being American, I criticize the US based on actual knowledge and experience. Most British posters here criticize based on a holiday to Florida and what the BBC tells them.
 
 
And of course its easier to have a detached house here in the US as they are all made of crappy wood and take 2 days to build.

Lol, they're all millionares, and they're moving to/have moved to America so they can get even more money. I doubt they're moving there because they prefer American values and principles.

But they're paying American taxes, meaning that they are (at least financially) supporting the government. Think about it that way.
 
 
Fair enough. I dont really have a problem with Americans being arrogant. Its jsut that when there are Americans who are arrogant becasue of their ignorance of everywhere else, it gets annoying. As i said, I think most Americans can justifyably be arrogant even if their judgements are based on truth, its just that no a lot of them are.

I agree that htey havent moved there becasue they love it more, its just for the cash. I hope to live in New York and maybe Chicago for a bit when i get older, becasue i think the big city culture is great, but i could see the novelty wearing off pretty quickly. I love the deep red brick a lot of buildings are built with on east coast cities.

That's in Boston, but its similar ot the type of mental image i have. I think of that as quinessentially east coast American.

*Looks at sisters $2,000,000 wooden house on Long Island and all the wooden houses in the neighbourhood, and between here and the Catskill mountains, from the Bronx to Poughkeepsie, up to Cape Cod and over to Martha's Vineyard, and then looks out of a window for 2 hours en route from Penn Station to Washington Central and sees yet more wooden houses, then sees the trail of destruction on The Weather Channel after every tornado or hurricane, after they rip through yet more wooden houses*

Oh wow...you are writing this from a train! Wow that is so amazing! You can see all of the Eastern seaboard! I guess my suburban NJ street, where most of the houses are made at least partially of brick is some bizarre exception. And the fact that I can actually see them out my window right now much be some sort of hallucination. I am so silly.

Relax, honey. No one told you to move to the States. I'm sorry it's treated you so badly, but I think you are idealizing Britain. As a new Londoner, I don't think people are any friendlier or more intelligent than New Yorkers. At least New Yorkers who bump into you on the street will yell at you. In London I constantly have men in suits and old people bumping into me, and once even knocking me off the sidewalk, without any acknowledgement of my existence. And I'm a tall women; people can see me. They just have no bloody manners.

And don't get me started on the alcohol abuse that you lot call "a good night out." It's appalling.
 
 
You cant dispute that London is awesome though. The place I love is Paternoster square by St Pauls (i think its where the new stock exchange building is). I spend most of my time in that area coz my bro works on Fleet Street. In fact, the LSE campus isnt that far from Fleet Street is it? Just round the corner from the courts?

I like America. Just not that struck on NY, as I have said on many occasions. And for the record, if you think my idea of NJ is bad you should know what your fellow Americans say about it. And I dont idealize Britain. And I certainly dont feel that British people are friendlier or more intellegent than New Yorkers as I have said in previous threads. And you obviously havent been down past the UES frat bars on a Friday night. And I'd rather not be yelled at by people in the street!
Noone told you to move to England either, or to speak about America's superiority on threads on an internet forum where you know the vast majority of members are British. I have seen threads where this kind of attitude reduces the meakest members to profanity.
 
 
LSE is basically next to the Royal Courts of Justice.

I do love London quite a bit, which is why I'm moving there. But I'm not crazy about the fascist state that it is, between my Oyster Card tracking all of my movements and the CCTV taking my picture all day.
 
 
Its quite ironic really. My bro says trips to NY have amazed him becasue the security is so ****. Or rather, the people who are supposed to be implimenting it are so dumb. You'd think it would be the other way round becasue the UK is obviously second on the target list after the US.

Not sure what you're talking about here. Where have I gone on about America's superiority? America is racist, for one, which as a black person I clearly don't like.

I have made many comments on UK education, which I do not like. If I have children in Britain and raise them there, I will send them to an IB school. And I will encourage them to go to the States for university. That's my right to have an opinion, that studying 3 subjects past 16 and one subject past 18 does not make for a person with a diverse set of skills in an increasingly uncertain and competitive international job market.
 
 
None of the choices reflects my views on America. I disagree with some of their policies whilst agree with others. American people are 'okay'. Their government is 'okay' but had a very tough Presidency. America is okay and I do think it should have a special relationship with the UK. I'm pretty indifferent. I don't want to generalise Americans, but they can be a bit... you know... weird  .

I dislike their striking political stances which have remained unchanged for many years. It is arguably the most conservative and Christian country there is. The country just seems too controversial to be a superpower, though I can see no better substitute.

It is truely a great place to visit and great vacations induce people like me to up sticks and emigrate. I shall not elaborate any further, except to say that, although the Woody Alan movies hit the spot, Sex and the City should be against the Trades Descriptions Act, and dont come in February.

The World Wide Web was invented by Tim Berners Lee who was at CERN at the time.

The internet was, to an extent, invented by the yanks. They used telephone lines to connect a load of computer across the country in the 60's, primarily so as to have a multiply reduntant system in case of a Soviet nuke attack.

It was actually created to allow universities that were working on military projects to be able to interact with each other quicker.

Tim Bernars-Lee et al worked at CERN, on the French/Swiss border. However, a lot of the groundwork was done by American researchers. It was a global effort, really.

Regarding America, I think it is an interesting country with some amazing places. However, I don't think I would like to live there. The politics seem too polemic for me, and I don't like the general materialistic ethic going on there. Also Americans work much than Europeans. British people get about 17 days off a year, Americans can get about 4 (from The Economist). I don't like the high amount of religiosity there, especially since a lot of it of the conservative born-again type that seem very bigoted to me. I suppose Americans are arrogant, but then so were the British when they were the chief world power. Perhaps Americans have little interest in the world around them. A recent Pew survey showed that 31% of Americans don't know that Dick Cheney is the vice-president, and more than 60% don't know who the Russian president was. That might seem bad, but then your average British person probably wouldn't do much better in a survey altered for Britain.

 Here  is the survey. As an example of the political bitching, the report was seized upon by some because Fox viewers came in near the bottom, despite the fact that viewers of the O'Reilly factor are among the most knowledgeable. Can you imagine a similar report here being used to try and state that viewers of BBC or ITV news are less knowledgeable because of their political beliefs? I suppose TV news channels aren't as politically biased as they are in the US. I dislike their lack of social security, but then I'm a lefty European socialist. I dislike the death penalty and their whole attitude to crime. It doesn't seem to be working either. The Virginia shootings are making me think about gun laws; I can see the arguments for being sides. The way climate change has been made into a political issue irritates me, but Al Gore can be partly blamed for that.

I think the above things are what differentiate the US from Britain. America has a lot more poor aspects than I posted, but then so does Britain so it's hardly fair. No country is perfect, after all. I think anti-Americanism is a knee jerk reaction from people who think very simplistically. At the end of the day, I'd rather have American hegemony than Chinese. And even though I support the UN, there is no doubting that is has many problems and I can't really blame the US for ignoring it a lot of the time.

Black people are just as racist as white people. The only difference the government allows black people to be racist. White people lose their radio shows.

Ask Jesse Jackson what happened to the scholarship money he was supposed to give to the prostitute that was "raped" by the Duke Lacrosse players. I'll save you the time: he never gave it to her. Why? Because she was a liar. And, Jesse Jackson is a racist who jumped on the bandwagon stricly based on race before he knew the facts. For what it's worth, he donated the money to Rutgers University.

And, what the **** does you being black have anything to do with not liking racism? That's why America IS racist. You as a PERSON should not be happy with racism. But, your polarization of race just proves why we aren't where Dr. King would have wanted us to be as a nation as far as race is concerned.

America is a wonderful country and is what all others should aspire to be, as the most powerful country in the world they should have the biggest say and anyone who is anti-amercian is just jelaous of them.

The fact the terrorists groups here and in the middle east shout "death to america" and all that jazz cracks me up, especially when they have cans of Coca Cola in their hands with Nike baseball hats on their head.

Stars and Stripes forever!

Umm...clearly as most racism in American is towards non-whites, I would imagine that many white people are ambivalent about racism. In my experience, most white Americans fall into two camps:
1. are racist themselves
2. don't think racism exists
The majority are in the second category.
So they probably wouldn't be as affected by it as I am.

Surely that sort of labeling would fall under the category of prejudice?
 
 
Is it a prejudice to think that most white Americans are more idealist about race relations than they should be?

I assume you mean the conflict in Northern Ireland. The one in which the US refused to stop the those of it's citizens who were openly funding those making the bombs aimed at UK citizens and the government.

Imagine if we refused to stop British citizens funding Al-Qaeda.

1 - Speaks for itself.
2 - You proclaim that America is racist. You also conclude that most white people "don't think it exists." Therefore, you conclude that most white people are ignorant to the fact that racism exists.

Explain to me how I've "interpreted" it wrong.

Well, you are; You did say that all white people are ignorant. That's pessimistic and racist.

Wah wah wah. How many times have YOU been jumped based on the tone of your skin? Because I know it's happened to me on MORE than one occasion just because I was one of 3 white kids in my neighborhood. Don't give me that ****. Racism is a carousel and every race is on it.
 
 
I disagree with that. But I've gotten nasty looks from white girls for going out with white men too.

Listen. I'm sorry you were jumped. I don't see how you could possibly interpret anything I've said to mean that I support racism by anyone.

But to be honest, racism from whites to blacks is not only more common in the US, it is more powerful. White people are in charge of the nation. This is why black people who murder white people get the death penalty much more common than black people who murder other black people, for example. The institutional racism in the US is towards minorities, and that is the most harmful kind.

Frankly, I find these debates annoying, because I'm almost always the only black American posting on TSR and I get the brunt of whatever other posters want to say to black people but cannot or are afraid to.

I really don't want to get bogged down in this, obviously that girls parents are racist but is the second guy? I've heard much worse from black musicians on the radio. Also, I don't know the origin or connotations of 'nappy' despite knowing what it means, but how is 'ho' race specific?

Whether a comment is 'racist' seems really quite subjective and the judgment appears to be totally given to the person it's aimed at. Surely there's an element of intention involved in whether something is racist or not? Anything could be racist, even an insult with no obvious racist connotations, given the relevant intentions. Why not the other way round? Or at least, why couldn't it mitigate it's racism?

Unbeleivable, you must have had some experiences then because most white Americans I have came accross have been friendly, courteous and most definately not racist.

It really makes me sick when people play the racist card, why not grow some balls and treat it with the contempt it deserves instead of acting the wounded soldier all the time.

Yesterday Oprah had several people in the hip-hop industry discussing rap lyrics and Imus. It's not something that goes unaddressed within the black community. However those rappers are black, so they are misogynist. I personally organized a talk with a professor last year on misogyny in hip-hop. Imus's comments have just brought it into a larger sphere; it was already a major topic of discussion on my campus and in the academy (see bell hooks).

Anyway, Imus is a white man, so his comment was both racist and misogynist. "Jigaboo" is also a VERY RACIST term for a black person. They totally took it out of context of the Spike Lee movie (which was not Do the Right Thing, by the way). Besides the fact that not a single girl on that team even has nappy hair; they are black, but they are not "nappy headed."

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui1jPNDWArM 
 
 
Surely the fact that Imus was fired as a result of these comments shows that racism isn't tolerated...

Well then you are far too easily offended, have you never heard the term "sticks and stones".

Boo hoo, so find something offensive, there is a shock, people get slagged all the time, colour of hair, size of genitals, country of origin, accent, colour of skin.
Who cares, its not exactly gonna physically hurt you is it.

Ok that's the bit I don't get. If two men were to say what that radio chap said, one black and one white, the black man would be a misogynist but the white man would be a misogynist and also assumed to be racist. Even if they both made the comment with the same intentions.

If the predominantly white institutions of America can be said to have an institutional racist bias. Could not the black community be said to have a cultural assumption of racism?

A lot of people keep saying that they don't like or don't want to visit the US because it is too religious. This is an attitude I have a hard time understanding.

I choose not to go because I'm not interested in religion and don't want to give up that much of my free time on a Sunday. I've been invited to go, and I've said no. The big question I have for all of you is what exactly is the big problem if my coworkers want to go to church on the weekend? Why is it anymore of a problem than if they want to go fishing on the weekend and I'm not a fisherman? How does this affect me? They go to church and I don't. So what?

Shady Lane has pointed out that race is still an issue in the US and I agree with her. I see a different form of prejudice coming from the mostly British members of this forum. Why do so many people hate someone who wants to spend a sunday in church?

It's not that they go to church per se, but perhaps the views which one who goes to church every sunday may hold.

Note that I stress the may and perhaps to ward of criticism.

Having said that, I don't think the US is so religious, that I would not go on holiday over there. The US stance on global warming and the environment is probably a bigger reason I would refuse to spend my pounds over there.

America remains a controversial and strikingly Christian country. It even uses the death penalty.

A country can be both liberal and controversial. Incidentally, some states are not so liberal. I'm not one of those nutters who say America is as bad as Iran, by the way. Just elements, such as the death penalty usage, make it somewhat controversial. Its interventionalist policies also make it a big character in the international community (disregarding the sheer size of the country for a minute.) I would much prefer a less provocative superpower.

It's not 'hate' as far as I can see, certainly not if you widened your sample (from just a forum) to the British public. It's a manifestation of the different conduct of our respective religious populations. Perhaps, perceived conduct.

In the UK, religion barely leaves the confines of an individual's thoughts unless they are in church or similar. It's rarely discussed and almost never flaunted. The exception being among a relatively small proportion of the community who quite literally wear their religion for everyone to see. i.e. through religious dress. Even then it's generally kept pretty subtle. Compare that to the perception of American religiousness as a badge, something to make obvious, discuss, push and be proud of. The most notable difference being in the Christian populations, there's no halls packed with people waving their arms about over here. Or, at least, that's the perception.

You may disagree with abortion, but that does not make it right to impose those wives on others.

No, abortion is legal in all parts of the US (Roe v Wade), although there is a legal ambiguity in North Dakota. The only reason why European today is a capital punishment free-zone is because of the EU. The majority of people in European countries such as Poland, Turkey, the UK, Austria and etc support capital punishment, but they cannot do anything becuase of EU pressure.

Bush never claimed god told him to go to war.

 http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/abb...563027485.html 

Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas has denied an account by another Palestinian official of a meeting with US President George Bush in which Bush is cited as saying he believed that God told him to go to war in Afghanistan and Iraq.

A statement in Abbas's name released by his office said an excerpt from an interview with Palestinian Information Minister Nabil Shaath due to be broadcast by the BBC in which Shaath described a meeting with Bush in June 2003 gave a "completely false" account.

"This report is not true. I have never heard President Bush talking about religion as a reason behind the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. President Bush has never mentioned that in front of me on any occasion and specifically not during my visit in 2003."
 
 
There you go.

Notice how people are always so keen to question any evidence that puts Bush in the right, but take in anything without question that puts him in bad light.
 
 
Just out of morbid curiosity I am wondering what possible justification there is for voting for 'America is the great satan and must be destroyed', as some people have done. Are these people calling for the death of the hundreds of millions who live in the US? If so, I can't possibly comprehend such unwarranted hatred and blood thirst.

It's just people who take in what popular musicians say to extremes.

LOOK AT ME IM ANTI AMERICAN, IM JUST LIKE BOB GELDOF LOL.

Anyone in the showbiz world should not be allowed to dabble into politics, makes things far too messy. How on earth does someone who plays a musical instrument badly / sings badly for a living know better than a team of thousands of highly paid professionals. The musicians do it because they want to be rebellious and trendy, and then the public blindly follow like sheep.
 
 
The death penalty is cost efficient. I like it for that reason.
 
 
It's like that with everything in life. Everyone loves to hate the greats. It can been seen in sports very often.
Teams people love to hate: Yankees, Bulls (in their day), Cowboys, Notre Dame, etc.

It is true that people to tend to like the underdogs, but I think the current anti-Americanism has nothing to do with it with being 'great'. The US was 'great' when Clinton was presiding in the White House, but the anti-Americanism back then is non-existent compared to the amount of anti-Americanism in the world today, after 7 years of Bush rule.

In "quantity" but not "quality."

The hijackers on 9/11 didn't decided to carry out that sort of plan after Bush took office. That hatred had been brewing for decades. All Bush did was stir up the already massive hornet's nest.

The cost to execute an inmate is more than the cost to incarcerate them for 40-75 years? (Last question on this matter for me. Another debate, another thread.)

That argument is totally spun out of context as it only applies to the US, where people who are sentenced to death rot on death row for a few decades before they are executed.

Indeed, the quantity has increased, but also the quality. Events such as the continuing Iraq war, Guantanamo Bay and etc, fuel hatred against the US in the Muslim world, but also annoy non-Muslims. In the aftermath of 9/11, the US had the sympathy of most of the world, but within a few years, it has become one of the most despised countries in the world.

The number of appeals that people on death row are allowed, hugely increase the costs. Furthermore, if the only reason you support death penalty is the financial side, which is flawed anyway, then one with your stance could easily argue against habeas corpus, trials and etc.

I'd say that's true. I had a much more postive view towards America in general in the Clinton days.

Studying American history has also increased my negativity towards America in general, as well as the last 7 years.

"This report is not true. I have never heard President Bush talking about religion as a reason behind the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. President Bush has never mentioned that in front of me on any occasion and specifically not during my visit in 2003."

 

Nabil Shaath, who was Palestinian foreign minister at the time, said: "President Bush said to all of us : 'I am driven with a mission from God'. God would tell me, 'George go and fight these terrorists in Afghanistan'. And I did. And then God would tell me 'George, go and end the tyranny in Iraq'. And I did."

Mr Bush went on: "And now, again, I feel God's words coming to me, 'Go get the Palestinians their state and get the Israelis their security, and get peace in the Middle East'. And, by God, I'm gonna do it."

Abbas' claim doesn't somehow debunk Shaath's claim. It's disputed, maybe Abbas wasn't around at the time ? It looks like we'll never know for sure, but it seems Abbas only denied it for political reasons. But my point is more general. Bush manages to invoke voices in his head which take effect on decisions he makes. For example:

 
"I feel like God wants me to run for President. I can't explain it, but I sense my country is going to need me. Something is going to happen... I know it won't be easy on me or my family, but God wants me to do it."
 

--George W. Bush commenting to Texas evangelist James Robinson in the run-up to his presidential campaign

 
I've heard the call. I believe God wants me to run for president.
 

-- George W Bush, quoted from Aaron Latham, "How George W Found God," George Magazine, September, 2000

A man who acts on voices in his head is clearly not fit to be any sort of President.

What part of American history? I think the founding ideals of America were very good, but they seem to have been lost somewhere. I find it interesting that the Founding Fathers all had what were then very liberal, forward thinking views, but many conservatives quote them when it suits.

I'll offer one American's opinion.
I think the war in the Mideast is a travesty, and I would prefer to divorce myself from the actions taken by the current administration.
It has been reported that G W Bush referred to our Constitution as "just a God Damned piece of paper" when confronted with the legality of some of his directives in his "War on Terror".
The Bush administration has done more to ruin the reputation of the USA than any president I could name since Abraham Lincoln, who led this nation into a catastrophic war.
Our President proclaimed that we were attacked on Sept. 11, 2001 because we were "free and prosperous", poppycock!
His solution now seems to be one of making us less free and less prosperous, apparently to preclude any further aggression.
Most Americans do not approve of what is happening, it does not phase our President in the least, his last election is behind him, and he believes, quite correctly, sadly, that our "greatest Presidents" have been wartime presidents, and he wants his place in history.
I am sure his name will never be forgotten, unfortunately.

and don't you just get tired of the anti-Semitism card? It's the oldest one in the book and gives anti-Semitism a new meaning. Boring, Bismarck - get over it.

  I never said it did. However I really don't want to go through the whole exhausting abortion debate again. What I will say, is that if scientists or other experts agree that something is actually 'immoral', such as murdering, based upon facts, then society has every right to implement its restrictions for the good of humanity. Abortion is not seen to be as bad as murder in today's society. Human cells with potential to become humans at the age of 21 weeks after fertilisation are seen as inferior to other humans. Whether this is right or wrong, I would prefer not to discuss.

 
No, abortion is legal in all parts of the US (Roe v Wade), although there is a legal ambiguity in North Dakota.
 

I think it would be fair to say that a ban on abortion would be more widely accepted in the USA, given that politicians publicly campaign on such issues. Interestingly, I didn't know that abortion was legal in all states. You learn something new everyday...

 
The only reason why European today is a capital punishment free-zone is because of the EU.
 

Certainly in the UK that's not the sole reason.

 
The majority of people in European countries such as Poland, Turkey, the UK, Austria and etc support capital punishment, but they cannot do anything becuase of EU pressure.
 

The majority of the UK don't support the death penalty. From 1974 to 1994 the debates in parliament conclusively voted against the death penalty. The Timothy Evans case was still fresh in many people's memories. However, the cause for this anti-capital punishment is irrelevant. The fact is, in the US capital punishment is popular in many states. The USA exercises its liberty to employ the death penalty.
 
 
Is there even any truth in the argument that the Jewish lobby influences US foreign policy? Its smacks of the same half assed attempt to explain things by saying 'god made it all'.

The US is practically ran by lobbying and special interest groups from all areas of society, so it's hardly a Jewish thing.

The Jewish lobby in the United States is strong, and it may influence foreign policy, but the Jewish lobby is merely one of an array of different lobbies.
 
 
Hey Bizzy, do you consider Judaism a religion or a race?
 
 
but how can you really justify a separate ethnicity based on an ideology?
 
 
If any British people here had any awareness of their own history they would feel sorry for America's position in the world and view it with a certain amount of irony.
The British Empire was the global superpower before the US and it (ignoring the self-depreciating liberal left) left a legacy of common law, civil service, parliament and democracy. This was mainly for it's own end but the outcome was a method for running a country in a stable way that worked (check out Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, Malaysia, Singapore etc...) Yes it had some dark moment but what power doesn't?

I think the US will be remember for a series of failed wars and a global detailed coverage of every mistake it makes. It is under an intense media spotlight all the time. This is one thing the British Empire never had to stand up to and it makes me wonder if the public's perception would have been different if the British Empire had been followed by a camera and microphone.
 
 
It certainly would. I suppose you could argue that the fledgeling mass media played a part in the demise of the Empire - certainly in India - but by and large it didn't have to contend with it, and I think a significant cause of global anti-Americanism is the combination of a perfectly ordinary jealousy of the current top dog, and the effect of modern telecoms.

That said, I'm not sure what legacy the era of US hegemony will be said to have left when it, eventually, passes. Although I don't know when that will be.

Not really. Judaism has remained relatively untainted, comparatively speaking.

Yep, which is why I've got dark hair and skin (Jewish) but green eyes (probably not from genes that originate in biblical Judea) and often get mistaken for being Irish or Italian. However, the fact that so may Jews "look Jewish" means its probably not that dilute.

BTW. I was supposed to be American. Its thought that the cohort of Russian Jews that went over to Britain at the beginning of the 20th century actually bought a ticket to NY but were swindled and got off in England. Apparantly my grandma was there for 3 years before she realised. Maybe they mistook the Humber Bridge for the Brooklyn Bridge and black pudding for bagels!

"Untainted" Rusty, Oy!

Oh, I'm not going that far back. I'm referring to the Jim Crow era, Civil Rights, McCarthyism, Vietnam etc.
 
 
It'll all be gone by the morning.
 
 
American women in NY have better nails and better teeth thanks to Vietnamese nail techs and Jewish dentists. I am going back to Britain with both, but a substantially lighter wallet. American women in LA have better everything, but most of it is fake.
 
 
What does a Jew look like? the stereotypical black hair and dark features could easily be mistaken for being Black Irish or whatever.

Black Irish? Not sure about that. But yes: even the stereotype isn't conclusive, and there are plenty of Jews to whom it does not apply in the slightest.
 
 
That's true. Living in England, if you see a girl or boy with dark hair and skin, but Caucasian, and without a button nose, you think they are Jewish. However, in America, they could be anything, Italian, Spanish, Mexican etc. However, some Jews you can tell straight away because they are so inbred they look like they've just stepped out of the Children's Illustrated Haggadah. I get mistaken for Irish sometimes, but I have a little French Canadian Catholic mixed in.
 
 
As somebody who lived in Germany for the first fifteen years of his life (where there are, understandably, not that many Jewish people), and then in a pretty white, middle class part of Britain, I find this idea of 'looking Jewish' very strange...
 
 
I don't hate Americans but i hate their self arrogance and the fact that they can be manipulated to so easily.  

btw anyone ever noticed that jews usually have the same surnames? Names like Cohen,Levy and names that contain or end with Berg or Stein.

Cohen and Levy are Hebrew, Cohen means priest. Another Jewish name is Kohn, obviously related to the Urdu name Khan. They are true Jewish names. Berg and Stein are just German Diasporic names. Quite often, German names were given to Jews when they arrived at the country as antisemitic perjoratives, e.g. the Jewish surname Goldwater comes from Goltwasser, which literally means piss. Nice.
 
 
I hate how insular America is. That ****s me off...
 
 
On a lighter note. When I came here it was so nice not to see the ****ing Beckhams on the cover of every magazine. Now they've followed me over here, and they are all over the place. Thank G-d I'm going home.

To all people who say they "hate all Americans":

Someone would have to be incredibly stupid to say that they "hate Americans". USA has 300 million people, 99%+ whom you've never met. should people write off such a population and assume that all 300 million of them fit their stereotype of "satan"? I don't think so. The same logic can be applied to the British, Russian, Chinese people, etc.

Of course, it is fine for people to say they don't like the government of USA, as that is obviously an entirely different matter.

Cheers!  
 
 
You only "hate" people/things who have something you don't. In most cases, and in this one, that thing is control. (With the exception of things that directly affect the human senses; noises, tastes, smells, etc)

I hate spiders, they control my fear.
I hate terrorists, they control societies fear, actions, opinions.
I hate illegal immigrants. They have more control of our borders than we do.

Well to me the idea of Jews looking Jewish is just as dumb as saying Christians look Christian. Fair enough, Judaism mightnt have been an evangelical religion, which I dont agree maintains its 'purity' (e.g. millions of marraiges were one person has converted) but if this is the case, then what ethnic group were/are the people who worship Judaism? The ethnic group cant be the same name as the relgion, especially since they probably existed before the religion. In the same way that Irish Celts are Christian, or Saxons Christian, what is the name of the ethnic group who originally worshipepd Judaism?

It seems to me that the idea of everyone being different, through religion or history or whatever, is sort of fround upon in most of society. Its not really a good thing to think you're 'different' from a muslim coz the PC line is we're all the same, but when Jews say they're different its fine?

I also dont buy the line where if a kid is born to a say, non Jewish man and a Jewish woman or whatever, then they are 'half Jewish' or have 'Jewish blood', as if the fact they have 'Jewish blood' makes them biologically different from someone who hasnt. I'm 'half Irish' given my dad is Irish, but in reality I'm no more Irish than my English nextdoor neighbour given i've barely been over there, was born in England and have grown up here. I have no idea of what is it to be Irish. To be honest, If i was Irish and someone like me came over saying how 'oh Ireland is in my blood, its where my roots are', i'd find it annoying. The only way your 'blood' could have a bearing on who you are is if it prompted you to you go and live in Ireland or wherever and then your exposure to their culture might make you more Irish.

That type of thing annoys me with some British Asians. They're ****ing born in England, have grown up here, have never been 'home', but still then rediculously say 'oh I'm Bangladeshi first and English second'. How the **** are they?

The concept of your 'blood' determining who you are is as false as the eugenics that sought to investigate this phenomenon.

The 'Black Irish' are white Irish people black hair and the corresponding darker complexion. They are not distinguished between in the British Isles, but they are on American race forms, I never realised such a group existed untill a few weeks ago. Actually, my dad is 'Black Irish', but I have blond hair and blue eyes (mum is reasonably fair), so i look nothing like my 'heritage' after just one generation. So i dont know how Jews have managed to look 'Jewish' for the last 3000 years.

Back on topic, the thing that irritates me most about some in the American media is how they manage to totally get the wrong end of the stick in a situation, and then act smug and pleased with themselves as though they have found the truth. I still like America though, and the vast majority of American people. I think thick working class Americans, or bigoted southerners of whatever are just as annoying to me as thick working class Liverpudlians. I'm working class, but that's no excuse to be ignorant of everything around you.

No different to the Scottish clans, really. There are plenty of people who have the same " Ah..." response to a Campbell as others would to a Rosenberg.
 
 
I've got an Irish surname - Considine. Several people have asked me if its Greek, which i thought was mad since Gaelic and Greek have absolutely no relation :P
 
 
Lots of people in the North West have Irish surnames.

They are the people of Judea. The whole point of Judaism, if I'm not mistaken, is that it's a covenant between God and the people of Judea, and by extension, their descendants. From an entirely theological point of view that doesn't make much sense to me (how can a universal God single out one people as the chosen ones?), but that's what I understand.

 
It seems to me that the idea of everyone being different, through religion or history or whatever, is sort of fround upon in most of society. Its not really a good thing to think you're 'different' from a muslim coz the PC line is we're all the same, but when Jews say they're different its fine?
 

Well Jews are a race (the people of Judea), whereas Muslims are people of several different races who ascribe to a religion. Nationality and race don't come into it.
 
 
How are Jews soely the people of Judea if you can covert to Judasim to get married? A person whose wedding we're going to later this year is getting married to a Jew. Her surname is McKenna, but shes converted to Judasim to marry this dude (first Jewish wedding i will have ever gone to). She isnt from Judea. I'd wager cases like this over the years have certainly made the idea that Jews are from Judea, just as Saxons we're originally form Saxony, irellevent in the modern day.

 
The whole point of Judaism, if I'm not mistaken, is that it's a covenant between God and the people of Judea, and by extension, their descendants.
 

Well if this is the case then it proves my point. They are relating their ethnicity to a theological position. There is thus no different ethnicity in biological terms, apart from the 'ideological ethnicity' of their supposedly being god’s kids. As for that line, well we all think we're bloody gods kids.
 
 
Probably what upsets me most about the US is the frustration. The Founding Fathers gave them a better than even chance to make something special out of a fresh start. And we're left with a country that epitomises most of what they were trying to avoid.

Having visited America countless times, having lived in Britain and abroad and having worked and travelled with different classes of Americans, I can't escape the impression, unpleasant though it be, that the US is just about the only country whose intelligent, educated natives stay at home while the ones you meet travelling are the ignorant, insular bigots.

Worse than that, the country's belligerent adolescence is not only harming everything and everyone it touches, it isn't even helping itself. The British Empire, flawed though it was, did at least leave some good for some of the people in some of the places it affected. The US empire seems likely to leave nothing but hatred, division and destruction at significant cost to itself.

There is so much good about the US, it has so much potential; why is it hell-bent on hating the world and destroying itself?

Good post; I think it must simply be the mass-media factor. No Empire has ever had to contend with that to anything like the same degree as has the US. There are entire swathes of the world where one-track anti-US media sources seem to have near-total control over the popular consciousness. Once you've got that, a corresponding xenophobia from significant proportions of the US is highly likely due to exactly the same "everybody hates us" sentiment as is found in North Korea, Israel and, with regard to Europe, the UK.
 
 
Am I right in thinking that the consitution did say there had to be a separation of church and state? if this is the case, why are atheists so hated, and why does it seem you have to be Christian to be decent in politics over there? All politicans have to say they go to church and all that jazz to come across as electable. Isnt this exacly what the consitutuon didnt want? Has it always been like this? The bible bashers didnt seem as prevelent in Clinton's time. There was uproar when that Sentaor said he would be putting his hand on a Koran when he was sworn in, but the swearing in ceremony doesnt even have anyhting to do with relgion, its only the bible bashing evangelicals who have got into office that have introduced this practice and made it precedent, so now anyone who really wants to go by what the consittuion laid out is considered unAmerican, when its really the bible bashers in office that are unAmerican.

What's worse is that most of the bible bashers are evangelicals or pentecostals, the folk who take the bible literally. They basically follow a watered down Christianity which doesnt require its followers to think of consider anything, becasue everything is already interpreted for them. That type of intellectual laziness is damaging in a modern state. At least Catholisim or Anglicanism is a bit more considered and nuanced in its beliefs, becasue its bothered to think about them. Rowan Williams spent a lot of time discussing and wahtnot and stated that the creation story shouldnt be taken literally. But evangelicals believe every word of the creation story literally, and hate anyone who doesnt, and becasue so many of them have managed to wrap themselves around American politics like poisin ivy, they also say these 'godless secular liberals' are unAmerican. Why has it even got to the point where being a 'secular liberal' is an insult?

What's Ironic is that britian does have an official relgion (the CofE) and yet its one of the most religiously apathetic and secular places around. America doesnt, the consitution explicitly states that you shouldnt, but is the complete opposite of what Britian is.

And who rebuilt the European economy, kept Europe secure, prevented God knows how many conflicts, spread free trade across the world, and single-handedly maintained the world economy for nearly 3 decades?  
 
 
Cant argue with the first one, although there is a difference between providing money and actually doing the rebuilding. Second one, it was more the EEC/EU. You can count conflicts saved on one hand and conflicts started on the other, Britian spread free trade across the world, and has probably been historically the most free trade country around. How can you single handedly maintain the world economy? The whole point of globalisation is interdependence. Indeed, the USA is a MASSIVE player in the world economy, but it is still one hub among many. Global dependance on the US economy, although perhaps somthing to brag about, isnt necessarily a favourable thing. The '29 Wall Street Crash is evidence of that. You want a global economy where if one part is in recession, there is always another big player/selection of players in boom or doing well to help pull them out of it, not one that all goes into recession at the same time.

The one thing you cant take away from you guys though is efficiency of your human capital. Economically, your efficiency is impressive, no doubt about it, but its the social impact of that kill or be killed mentality which is more ambiguous.

It's rather hard to rebuild without the money (and security that the US provided). You're actually claiming that the EEC/EU kept Europe secure?   Britain might have supported free trade in the 19th century, but it was protectionist ever since WWI, and it's pretty damn hard to deny that the US has been far and away the biggest actor in spreading free trade in the second half of the 20th century. You should read up on Bretton Woods if you want to see how the US single-handedly ran the world's economy for nearly 3 decades. As to how it did it, having 50% of the world's GDP helps (after WWII). Don't see your point about the Wall Street crash. It certainly didn't cause the depression in the US or in Europe.
 
 
The wall street crash never casued depression in US or Europe? What? remember the slogan 'In Hoover we trusted and now we are busted'? People living in card board boxes in central park, soup kitchens on the streets? One of the key reasons Hitler and Mussolini got to power was becasue of how the depression hit European economies, prompting extreme figures to rise up and promise salvation. Was European appeasment responsible for Hitler's rise, or was it the Hire Purchase methods that backfired on American families?

I'm not disupiting that money was important, i'm just saying throwing money at somthing doesnt solve the problem, it just provides a way to do so, you still have to solve it. I'm not mitigaging how much was given though.

The Coal and Steel commision, and then the EEC prevented Europe from waring against itself again, and provided a bloc of capitalism. The US didnt tell us all to get togeather.

Saying Britian was proctionist in the years immediately following WW1 is hardly disproving its free trade record given every other nation was pursuing protection at that time too. In the 30's when everyone else was still protectionist, we were trying to induce trade again by not introducing tariffs. What tariffs there are on some of our goods are no more steep than what you have on your, say, steel. Its also hard to be that protectionist when your part of a trading bloc that allows for the free movement of the 4 factors of production.

Additionally, isnt the US famous for its isoloationism at the turn of the century? What's more, Marhsall Aid wasnt given by a magnamimous US, you wanted to turn Germany into an agrarian economy and 'cut and run' after WW2. Churchill and Britian had to pursuade the US that leaving Europe on its knees would be a bad idea, especially given communism was kicking off. It gets on my tits the way Americans talk about Marshall aid as though it was given from the good of thier heart. Nevertheless though, you still gave it, im not disputing that.

I think the oil crisis of the 70's kind of showed who really ran the world economy. I'm not disputing your a big player, and movements in America created tremors elsewhere, but you wernt the only mover and shaker. You seem to contradict yourself by saying how prevelent free trade was globally, but then saying America ran things. Its impossible to run things in a global economy.

As for spreading free trade, Britian created the means to do so given our empire was one of trade. Most nations already had the means to engage in international trade becasue of us. America might have done alot with NAFTA, but you negate what the creation of the ECC/EU and most of all the collapse of communism did for the growth of free trade. America didnt just go 'lets all trade freely' and everyone went 'sweet!', trade has picked up becasue of many reasons, not just becasue America has been a free trade nation.

You're joking right? The Crash was a symptom of the unstable economic conditions of the time. It didn't cause the Depression.  

 
The Coal and Steel commision, and then the EEC prevented Europe from waring against itself again, and provided a bloc of capitalism. The US didnt tell us all to get togeather.
 

And whose troops made sure that Europeans didn't get invaded by the USSR? Whose troops alleviated French and British fears of a resurgent Germany?

 
Saying Britian was proctionist in the years immediately following WW1 is hardly disproving its free trade record given every other nation was pursuing protection at that time too. In the 30's when everyone else was still protectionist, we were trying to induce trade again by not introducing tariffs.
 

Once again, are you joking? Read about the Ottawa Convention. Britain enacted very harsh tariffs on everyone outside of the Commonwealth. Britain only wanted "free trade" with the Commonwealth (which it believed it could dominate by the way).

 
What tariffs there are on some of our goods are no more steep than what you have on your, say, steel. Its also hard to be that protectionist when your part of a trading bloc that allows for the free movement of the 4 factors of production.
 

Once again, are you joking? You can't look at single tariffs. The US has one of the lowest average tariff rates in the world (I believe Australia is the only developed country with lower tariffs).

 
Additionally, isnt the US famous for its isoloationism at the turn of the century? What's more, Marhsall Aid wasnt given by a magnamimous US, you wanted to turn Germany into an agrarian economy and 'cut and run' after WW2.
 

What the heck are you talking about? There were some proposals to that effect (mostly from the French), but Truman and Eisenhower never seriously considered them. The US is the one that pushed Germany to rearm, create a common currency (for the zones under American, French, and British occupation), and allowed it unfettered access to American markets (despite large tariffs on American goods).

 
I think the oil crisis of the 70's kind of showed who really ran the world economy. I'm not disputing your a big player, and movements in America created tremors elsewhere, but you wernt the only mover and shaker. You seem to contradict yourself by saying how prevelent free trade was globally, but then saying America ran things. Its impossible to run things in a global economy.
 

Actually, the oil crises marked the end of complete US dominance. The dominance existed beforehand. During the Six Day War in '67 for example, the Arabs and Iran also declared an embargo against the West, but the US (which still had a surplus of oil at the time) provided its own oil to its allies. Also, the Bretton Woods system was based around the US dollar, which made the value of the dollar artificially high, limiting US exports to Europe and increasing European exports to the US. The US never complained until this arrangement could no longer be tolerated by the US economy in the late '60s.

 
As for spreading free trade, Britian created the means to do so given our empire was one of trade. Most nations already had the means to engage in international trade becasue of us.

The bible bashers didn't seem as prevalent in Clinton's time. There was uproar when that Senator said he would be putting his hand on a Koran when he was sworn in, but the swearing in ceremony doesn't even have anything to do with religion, its only the bible bashing evangelicals who have got into office that have introduced this practice and made it precedent, so now anyone who really wants to go by what the constitution laid out is considered un-American, when its really the bible bashers in office that are un-American.

 

Not quite. The Constitution's aim was to make the Church and the State separate. The State cannot favour one religion, for example. See the controversies over putting the Ten Commandments up in courts and similar things. However, that does not mean that a politician cannot have religious beliefs. Given that such a large percentage of Americans claim to be devout Christians, then it's just a political necessity to come across as a good Christian. If the majority of the population were atheists or Jews or Muslims, the politicians would act accordingly. It's not really anything to do with the Constitution. Perhaps there is the fear that politicians are standing so that they can force their religious views on everyone else - banning gay marriage or gay sex, for example. However, the Supreme Court can be used in these cases. They recently struck down a law in Texas that illegalised gay sex. From a religious point of view, there is also the argument that religious people shouldn't use politics to achieve their ends - you get no brownie points for resisting temptation if the desired thing is illegal anyway.

What scares me more is the way in which words such as "treasonous" and "anti-American" are thrown around so freely.
 
 
 
You're joking right? The Crash was a symptom of the unstable economic conditions of the time. It didn't cause the Depression.
 

Unstable economic conditions, is that the boom in the 20's? The world had never had it so good, even Germany was rocking after hyperinflation in 24, Stresemann engineered the 'golden age' on the back good intenrational trade and political co-operation. 29 comes along and kills it all off.

 
And whose troops made sure that Europeans didn't get invaded by the USSR? Whose troops alleviated French and British fears of a resurgent Germany?
 

Fears of a resurgent Germany? We wanted a strong Germany for trade, you wanted to gut it and leave it for dead. I'm not disputing you kept a lot of troops in Europe and help ensure its safety, but would you have been able to have troops there if it wasnt for a captialist western Europe? Dont try to kid us by saying you were keeping troops there for our sake, you were scared of commuism threatening America, and so our reliance on your troops is ofset by your reliance on Western Europe's co-operation.

 
Once again, are you joking? Read about the Ottawa Convention. Britain enacted very harsh tariffs on everyone outside of the Commonwealth. Britain only wanted "free trade" with the Commonwealth (which it believed it could dominate by the way).
 

What period are you talking of? Given the commonwealth was being dismantled from 45 onwards, that would seem impossible. If you mean Chaimerlain's campagining for Imperial Preference in the 1900's, then fair enough.

 
What the heck are you talking about? There were some proposals to that effect (mostly from the French), but Truman and Eisenhower never seriously considered them. The US is the one that pushed Germany to rearm, create a common currency (for the zones under American, French, and British occupation), and allowed it unfettered access to American markets (despite large tariffs on American goods).
 

What are you speaking of here, gutting Germany or aid? why would France not want aid? As for wanting to get out, the US wanted to get away from Europe in WW1, that's why Wilson set up his 14 points to try and make everything dandy, but was ****ed over by congress which didnt want to join the League of Nations. The same thing occured in WW2, you just wanted to get out of Europe but we had to pursuade you. Ill find the evidence of that, all you have to know for A level history is semantics :P

 
Actually, the oil crises marked the end of complete US dominance. The dominance existed beforehand. During the Six Day War in '67 for example, the Arabs and Iran also declared an embargo against the West, but the US (which still had a surplus of oil at the time) provided its own oil to its allies. Also, the Bretton Woods system was based around the US dollar, which made the value of the dollar artificially high, limiting US exports to Europe and increasing European exports to the US. The US never complained until this arrangement could no longer be tolerated by the US economy in the late '60s.
 

Fair enough, you clearly know more than I in regard to the mid 20'th century, but as you say, the Bretton Woods thing isnt America 'running the world economy', its America looking after itself and not giving a **** about the effects its actions has on the rest of the world. You even admit that Bretton Woods collapsed becasue it wasnt suitable for America, and so everyone else had to find another way.

 
Um, have you ever heard of the WTO?
 

Yeah, its about as useful as the IMF.

I'm not disputing, obviously, America's superpowerdom, what im saying is America isnt this far sighted magnamimous father of the world that makes sure everyone else is ok. It acts in its own interests, and leaves others to deal with the wake it leaves. I.E. it behaves like a teenager.
 
 
I don't understand how good things America did 50 years ago absolves her from blame for the bad things she's doing now...

Actually it was based around Gold but the USD was often used as a substitute for ease of reserve management.

Given that the USD was routinely made stronger during Bretton Woods and that it immediately strengthened after it's collapse, it's valuation is not that cut and dried. Indeed it's average value since said collapse is approximately where it began. It took about 8 years until the USD made a concerted forray below it's base year value. It stayed there for about two years, only to be shortly followed by an 80% appreciation. It took another 6 years to get back to base where, bar one decent 5 year rally, it stayed marginally below ever since. Basically, USD over valuation during Bretton Woods is marginal to say the least. i.e. I wouldn't start using it as an example of the US being altruistic toward the world economy.

The Bretton Woods system disrupted American economic cycles, since the dollar wouldn't fall when the US economy was weak and it wouldn't rise when the US economy was strong. This led to inflation on the one hand and sharp recessions on the other. Furthermore, the dollar's average value since then isn't that important, since what matters is that the US was facing an acute economic crisis in the late '60s and early '70s. Its hands were tied in dealing with this crisis due to the value of its currency being fixed.

The stock market boom was not backed by similar rises in productivity or production. It was artificial. It was going to collapse and the only question was when. And the crash was made much worse by impending protectionist legislation. To think that a stock market crash can actually cause a depression is ludicrous. The stock market measures the health of the economy, not vice versa.

Please read some history before debating on this topic. France was strongly pushing for Germany to be completely annihilated. It was strong American pressure that got France to agree to merge the three German zones of occupation to create a Federal German Republic. And why are you bringing motives into this? It's irrelevant why the US did this.

Once again, motives are irrelevant. It is a fact that the US carried the world economy. It doesn't matter why it did so. This arrangement benefited Europe, and that's what should matter. It is also a fact that the US suffered economically from the arrangement, but it was willing to tolerate the costs when its GDP was nearly 50% of the world. Once its share of world production declined, when it started running fiscal and trade deficits, and when it became dependent on foreign oil, it could no longer pay the costs. Yes it was doing this for political reasons, but the fact is that it did so.

 
Yeah, its about as useful as the IMF.

For starters, the US created the WTO, the IMF, and the World Bank. And more importantly, the WTO has done far more for free trade than Britain ever has. It actually institutionalized free trade, and created mechanisms to punish countries that fail to meet their obligations. The WTO has successfully forced the US, the EU, Japan, and plenty of other entities to change their policies.
 
 
The whole point of crashes is that they cant be anticpitated. As for looking at textbooks, the textbooks that helped me blitz my early 20th century America paper suggested the crash was the casue of the world depression. You even aknowledge American economic hegdemony, free trade dominance and how they 'run the show'. The crash itself was damaging internationally, but subsequent recalling of loans by the US from countries which were also ****ed made things worse. It also ushered in massive protectionism as a result of the slump, which ended up prolonging things. Protectionism in America was symbolised by the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act. America and Germany got hit the worst, Britian didnt get hit that bad in comparison, but even we got nailed. Our staples were struggling anyway, and with the death of international trade, who were we gonna export to?

The point of stock market crashes is that they are symptoms of major underlying economic problems. They do not cause those problems.
 
 
Again, I have to wonder how American economic policy in the 1950's is relevant to unsavoury American actions today?

It was the same for every other country. It still can't be used as an example of US generosity or what not.

I agree on the more general point that the US has done a lot of good* but I'm just picking up on discrepancies. That's all.  

*though I would say that saying the US 'carried' the world economy or that it 'single-handedly ran' it is going too far.

The price of the dollar was set in '45 (give or take a few year). The European economies strengthened between then and the late '60s, yet most of them refused to change the price of their currency (relative to the US dollar).

That was pretty much the point. That exchange rates were kept fixed; despite the only period without revaluations being around 51-56. It wasn't a matter of refusing to do this-that-or-the-other for some malicious reason but that that was actually the plan. We know it was harmful now but back then they, obviously, didn't. Currencies were revalued by mutual agreement and out of necessity.

However you phrase it, it's not some kind of gesture by the US. There are plenty of others, stick with those.

The fact is that the European refusal to adjust the exchange rates meant that the US was flooded with European products, while US access to European markets was extremely limited (the huge European tariffs on American products, which the US tolerated, certainly didn't help either).
 
 
 
Read any recent history book on the topic. The general consensus is that the Crash was a symptom of the Depression. The markets usually sense danger ahead of time.
 

The earliest decrease in share price was in 1926 in the construction industry. Then in September 1928 for pretty much everything else. In September 1929 the rapid decline began. Before 1928, the USA benefitted from an economic boom. Even Germany was benefitting under Stresemann.

It didn't refuse. There was no question of revaluation. That was predominantly the point of the system, to keep exchange rates the static.

Yes, there's the possibility that the USD should have devalued but that was neither the point nor a certainty. The US was doing badly but so was Europe. As we've seen since, even under a floating exchange rate system a trade deficit doesn't necessarily mean devaluation nor does poor performance and a devaluation certainly doesn't mean a narrowing of deficits.

I'm starting to think you've got a serious victim complex developing here Bis.

My trouble is, I'm too ignorant to recognise American magnanimity when I see it. Perhaps you would enlighten my ignorance with some examples, preferably by comparing and contrasting with the conflicts that do make the news (feel free to limit yourself to those conflicts caused solely or jointly by the US).

For starters, it dissuaded right-wing officers from carrying out coups in most of central America and Peru. It helped manage the transition of Chile from a military dictatorship to a democracy. It reduced tensions in Macedonia and Albania. It worked (and continues to work) with the governments and oppositions in many African countries, persuading them to "fight" in elections instead of on the street. It managed the transition from military rule to democracy in South Korea, Taiwan, and the Philippines. And it's usually the first port of call in any part of the world where conflict is about to break out.

What's worse is that most of the bible bashers are evangelicals or pentecostals, the folk who take the bible literally. They basically follow a watered down Christianity which doesnt require its followers to think of consider anything, becasue everything is already interpreted for them. That type of intellectual laziness is damaging in a modern state. At least Catholisim or Anglicanism is a bit more considered and nuanced in its beliefs, becasue its bothered to think about them. Rowan Williams spent a lot of time discussing and wahtnot and stated that the creation story shouldnt be taken literally. But evangelicals believe every word of the creation story literally, and hate anyone who doesnt, and becasue so many of them have managed to wrap themselves around American politics like poisin ivy, they also say these 'godless secular liberals' are unAmerican. Why has it even got to the point where being a 'secular liberal' is an insult?

What's Ironic is that britian does have an official relgion (the CofE) and yet its one of the most religiously apathetic and secular places around. America doesnt, the consitution explicitly states that you shouldnt, but is the complete opposite of what Britian is.

 

Just because the US does not have an official religion does not mean that the US Constitution was trying to discourage people from being religious. The separation of church and state was always meant to protect religious freedom, not prevent people from being religious.

Also, it might be noted that religious fervor was rather on the decline in the US in the middle of the 20th century, but the Cold War actually pushed religion back to the forefront of American politics. The association of atheism with communism pushed the current notion that religious politicians can be more trusted.

Furthermore, in the US, religion has long been seen as part of one's identity (Tocqueville even wrote about this), which is more reasonable in a society that has no official religion than in one which does. I think, overall, the problem is that the American view of religion is rather different from that in much of the rest of Western Europe, which is probably derived from the history of religious freedom in the US. At the same time, I'd like to point out that Canadians are very similar to Americans in their attitudes toward religion.

Right. Religion "works" better in the United States, mainly because it has never been used as means to oppress or degrade another group of people; at least not anything close to the extents of which has been seen in Europe throughout history. The Constitution is responsible for the strength of religion here, but BECAUSE it keeps it seperated from the state. The state doesn't take a position on religion officially, and therefore candidates, not the goverment itself, are held responsible for their respective religions.

No official religion means no one religion has more power that the other in the eyes of the state. Therefore, no one religion controls the state, and therefore no one religion is a threat.

There isn't many countries in the world that are willing to wage war, taking the difficult decisions to make the world a safer place by spreading democracy and freedom. At least Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair had the guts to make those decisions regarding Iraq and Afghanistan. There are operational errors with regard to two wars, but I support the overall strategy of the US and UK in removing a) a dangerous and eratic dictator and b)The terrorist Taliban regime.

The USA is the beacon of liberty and freedom in this dangerous world that we live. The least we can say about the USA is the fact that it is the most powerful democracy in the world, which helps defend our democracy against all the evils in the world such as communism and authoritarian regimes.

Sorry for the delayed reply, I had to go missing for a few days coz I had coursework to hand in.

And the crash was made much worse by impending protectionist legislation. To think that a stock market crash can actually cause a depression is ludicrous. The stock market measures the health of the economy, not vice versa.
 

Its not at all. I’m not arguing the crash just appeared out of thin air and gatecrashed everyone’s party. There were some economic problems, a la Americans buying everything on HP and then not being able to pay or their being to many banks, but the stock market crash turned these semi serious problems into catastrophic ones. I’m sure you know how elastic a place the stock market is, even a whiff of a problem and there is chaos. The economic problems casued everyone to sell their shares, which in turn caused a collapse, which in turn destroyed companies wealth and even worse confidence in investing. This collapse, where companies were brought to their knees, then casued protectionism as half dead companies didn’t want to deal with foreign competitors too. You seem to be arguing that the crash just happened and people took no notice, and fate took its course all the way down depression lane. Its not like that, the crash made some pre-existing problems massive ones.

 
Please read some history before debating on this topic. France was strongly pushing for Germany to be completely annihilated. It was strong American pressure that got France to agree to merge the three German zones of occupation to create a Federal German Republic. And why are you bringing motives into this? It's irrelevant why the US did this.
 

I know, France wanted the same in WW1, it would given it took the brunt of both wars, which is why her opinion never really counted in either post WW1 and post WW2. Where your wrong is that the Americans also wanted a strong Germany. It was Britain who persuaded you not to ‘cut and run’ out of Europe again.

As for Britain being protectionist In the 30’s, that’s hardly a stain on its free trade history given everyone else was protectionist too, including the USA. You cant use that to sully our record.

 
Once again, motives are irrelevant. It is a fact that the US carried the world economy. It doesn't matter why it did so. This arrangement benefited Europe, and that's what should matter. It is also a fact that the US suffered economically from the arrangement, but it was willing to tolerate the costs when its GDP was nearly 50% of the world. Once its share of world production declined, when it started running fiscal and trade deficits, and when it became dependent on foreign oil, it could no longer pay the costs. Yes it was doing this for political reasons, but the fact is that it did so.
 

Actually, the motives aren’t irrelivent, because the thing that started off your flag waving was someone slagging off the USA for being a belligerent teenager. You countered by saying how the US has looked after the world and led it, when it hasn’t, its just done what it likes. The motives are therefore relevant. you said this:

 
And who rebuilt the European economy, kept Europe secure, prevented God knows how many conflicts, spread free trade across the world, and single-handedly maintained the world economy for nearly 3 decades?
 

 
Do you know how many conflicts the US is preventing at this very moment? Despite public rhetoric to the contrary, do you know who most countries call to mediate conflicts with other countries or with the opposition?
 

That doesn’t matter. Those things come with the job. All that matters is how America reacts to the few make of break situations that comes its way during its lifetime, its those things that define its greatness. I hand in one A grade piece of homework after another over the course of the year, but all those good pieces count for ****, all that matters is that I nail my final exam. If I don’t, I just go down as another mediocre student regardless of how well I did during the course of the year. The same goes for the US, its make or break situation was Sept 11, when it had a choice of what to do and had universal sympathy. Its blown its chance magnificently through Iraq and the 'war on terror', as though you can fight ideas with missiles. All this other behind the scenes stuff doesn’t matter; individuals and nations are defined by one or two set-pieces in their lifetime, and America is currently making a hash of dealing with one of those make or break situations.

I also wouldnt say the 70's oil crisis marked the end of Amercia's total dominance, it more marked the beginning of oil rich countries waking up to their nacent dominance and using it.

The USA is the beacon of liberty and freedom in this dangerous world that we live. The least we can say about the USA is the fact that it is the most powerful democracy in the world, which helps defend our democracy against all the evils in the world such as communism and authoritarian regimes.

 

I never knew Saddam or Osama were going to overthrow the monarchy ?
 
 
Democracy gets banded around as if its some inherently amazing thing, when its not. The technical workings of how a government is elected doesnt really count for much. Its supposed to instill choice, but how much choice do we have? WE usually have to pick between two diametrically opposed candidates who decide themselves to run. Additonally, once they're elected, the nation essentially becomes an elected dictatorship anyway. Everything from top up fees to road taxing has been widely opposed in Britian but has gone through anyway. Not only does this show the limits of democracy, it also shows acting essentially undemocractically isnt always a bad thing. British univeristies needed top up fees, regardless of what the public thought.

 
aking the difficult decisions to make the world a safer place by spreading democracy and freedom.
 

Freedom doesnt always follow democracy. As i said, setting up the technical electoral infastrucue or a governemtn in a nation doesnt automatically solve all the other problems. The mind block in Iraq is that democracy is supposed to fix everything, when its not, or that democracy is a big step forward, when really it isnt (esp. given amount of corruption). The USA seems to think becasue democracy works for them, it must work for everyone else too, and its not like that. Middle Eastern nations, and even Islam, isnt used to democracy, its used to a strong ideological leader telling people what to do. Who are we to say our way is better? AS for the USA being a becon of liberty, I think such fancy rhetoric is a bit wide of the mark. The US certianly isnt a bad place to live, and isnt that oppressive, but its not as free and liberal as everyone makes out. Lack of even basic social security infastructure means although poor people are often free to do things, there are many things they are not free from. Im not a socailsit or anything, but America isnt a free as you think. America's reputation for liberty was also a bit of an assumption made by other nations. When Ameirca has had a chance to prove how fair and just it is, its kind of botching it, with gwantanemo, torture and secret prisons and ****. Im not idealist who thinks this stuff doesnt go on anywhere else, but it seems in America that Americans have one set of freedoms and rights, and everyone else has another, lesser set.

Just becasue a government isnt elected doesnt necessarily make the nation it rules a really opressive, ****ty place to live.

Im also not saying trying to overthrow a tyrant isnt a noble pursuit (if the motives for overthrowing the tyrant are just, i.e. for the genuine benefit of the oppressed people), but trying to save the wolrd one tyrant at a time is futile, and the bleeif to do so is fantasy. One nation cant go round and save the world and make everyone happy, life just isnt like that. Its pointless to try and spread democracy, flowers and happiness around the world becasue it just causes more **** than it sorts out. Whats annoying is that everyone knows this, Blair and Bush know this, they didnt go into Iraq for the Iraqi peoples' sake, they went in for their own sake, but now theyre retrospectivly trying to say (partly, at least) that they DID.

I know i may come across as a Gaurdian reading socialist here, but im not. I was for the war when it was proposed, but given once we invaded our pretexts turned out to me false, it kind of negated my initial judgement on the issue. I also dont think we should just get out and leave them to it - the least we can do it try to is to try and sort out the Iraqi's lives we've ****ed up.
 
 
 
Do you know what happens to any booming economy, especially one with an artificially long boom?  
 

;yes; Ben Walsh even stated that the Wall Street Crash was the main cause for the depression.

Well that's certainly not some gospel truth. If the crash had been such a trigger it would have been followed a marked worsening of the recession, which was already in full flow. It didn't, as such it was just a feature. It was certainly the most obviously dramatic thing (to the average man on the street) and made the best headlines though.

I tend to side with the argument that it was only once the banking system started to implode that it became a crisis, one worthy of the label 'the great depression'. One could say that the depression was signed sealed and delivered by the death of Benjamin Strong.
 
 
It wasnt just a feature! Do you know what shares are? investments in companies. If confidence in companies drops, share prices drop, people sell shares, it ****s you up.

Yes, more than you probably imagine.

If a share were to drop from 100p to 1p what affect would it have on the company itself? Nothing. It has nothing to do with their day to day running (unless they are trying to raise capital), it's a market valuation that only affects the owners of the company or those wanting to take it over. As such it's affect was limited to savings and investments, cutting their value and skewing expectations. It had no direct affect on the underlying asset. The WS crash made a recession into a worse one but it didn't come close to causing a crisis on the scale of 'the great depression'.

Had the banking system stayed intact the Dow would have recovered, it certainly wouldn't have hit 41! The crash meant that those who had invested (queue Kennedy quote) had less, the banking implosion meant that an enormous number of people had nothing.
 
 
It dissuaded any sort of investment or risk in the following years, and investment and takeovers are drivers of growth. The biggest thing is confidence, both on investers and consumers parts. Given no1 was gonna spend and buy shares, they would likey save, but then the banks died. Cluster**** or what. I'm not saying the crash was the be all and end all, but it made bad things catastrophic. All the factors are cogs in the machine, but the crash was a big one, and located pretty close to the centre of the machine, meaning it ****ed everything else.
 
 
I must admit, I do seem to have a stream of anti-Americanism rushing through my blood these days which is probably entirely irrational, but it really is difficult to avoid. For a developed country of 300million, it is seemingly lacking in everything that makes a society civilised. It seems these days the USA is intellectually and culturally starved, expecially in the no-mans-lands of the Bible belt where chimpanzees probably live more productive lifestyles.
America seems to have serious issues that transcend George Bush, lets not forget who put him into the white house in the first place...
 
 
Various maps are produced from time to time that distort the relative areas of countries according to their GNP, carbon emissions or growth rate. It occurs to me that if one was produced judging instead on artistic capital, the two most powerful countries in the world today would be pretty hard to find. America because it hasn't had time to develop one and China because the CCP has made it its mission to destroy it.
 
 
I've had such fleeting thoughts, but i just think its coz the nutjobs have been given more airtime lately, perhaps coz bush, who is pretty religious, is in power. I kind of had the impression their society was a little more base and less subtle, less textured. Intellectually, it feels as everything gets treated as though its very striaght forward over there, as though things are understood at GCSE level. its the presence of understanding things in absolute terms which is worrying. But at the same time, there are clearly a huge number of highly intelligent individuals, and the average american is probably no different intelligence wise from anyone else, all im going on is media, films, and what i hear from my bro who spends months in NY society wise. Perhaps its becasue of the patriotism, it encourages beleiving things in absolute terms. 'WE are the best, WE are the most just', it sort of instills a certainy in judgement and action which isnt always a good thing, especially in the former.

Sometimes i just want to shout 'STOP! Wait a minute and have a little think before you do something, its not dithering, and it doesnt make your penis smaller, just pause for a moment, and then do.'

I still like America though, the prevelence of superficiality is what has made it so economically strong, and it can somtimes be a good thing culturally.

Its people like O'Rilley that make me want to cry. Look at this, just listen to him, and the beliefs he implicitly conveys in his voice tone.

I dont know if its me, but does anyone else thing British academics are the best academics? I dont know why Amiercan ones have a bad rep (this is history im talking about), but its the British, and very slightly less so the Germans, that run the show in academia. Even French pieces of history are best written on by Brits, although some translated German work is good. I know im stuck in the AngloSphere so im bound to see the prominence of English academia, but it just seems we're the most sensible in discussion.

I take your point. It was certainly a big deal but it wasn't sufficient to turn a recession into the great depression, just to make a recession into a bigger one.

Bail out the BoUS et al and you have no great depression, remove the WS crash and you still do.

You do realize we're talking about the 1920s, right? You know, when at least half the work force worked in agriculture, when only a handful of firms were public, and when only the rich (with a few exceptions) invested?
 
 
What are you saying, the NYSE is insiginificant? Dont people realise the amount of company bankruptices, laying off workers? And the companies who were private most likely interacted with companies that we're public, so its not as if private companies were dandy. Who buys the farmers food if everyone is broke?

Except the public corporations were responsible for an insignificant portion of the US economy. Since when do public corporations buy the farmers' food? Last time I checked, the food was either for their own consumption or sold in neighboring towns. The amount of workers employed by the public corporations would have been negligible as well. Please don't confuse 1929 with 2007.
 
 
the individuals who are no longer employed by public corporations im talking about. There is no need to patronise, how can you reasonably imply the NYSE had an insignificant part in the US economy and the world economy? Saying half were farmers means nothing, apart from the fact that another half were not.

For starters, a falling price of stocks does nothing for the well-being of the corporation. Secondly, even if many of the top corporations went under, and this certainly wasn't the case, then the resultant unemployment would not be very high. Third, saying that 50% worked in agriculture means that a vast majority of the other 50% worked in small factories and in services. Fourthly, the NYSE was indeed an insignificant portion of the US and world economy in 1929. Even today, the companies on the NYSE are responsible for 10-15% of the US GDP. In 1929, it would be silly to compare the NYSE with the major exchanges in Europe.

A million and one people have written about American history. Are you naive enough to take one guy's opinion as sacred and think that I must be making up a contradictory opinion without either research or justification? Are you? Honestly, that would be laughable.

Evidently you haven't noticed that there's more than one argument for how and when the great depression started. Do you even read oposing views or do you just accept orthodoxy? (The WSC argument is less of an orthodoxy than you might think anyway)

I suppose we should just tell the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York not to bother making that big expansion of Greek and Roman antiquities? After all, they're culturally starved. The 12 American Nobel Laureates in Literature must also be uncivilised...

The orthodox view is actually that the Crash was a symptom of the worsening economic conditions, not its cause. Even today a stock market crash wouldn't cause a recession (or are people blaming the 2001 recession on the stock market crash in 2000?). Back then, the stock market was a curiosity. To think that it had a significant effect on the economy is ridiculous.
 
 
Do you agree that the crash had a large impact on making a bad situation worse though?

No. I don't think a stock market crash has a significant effect on the economy. A crash serves as an indicator that the economy is flawed; it doesn't make the economy flawed.
 
 
so it had negligable impact, it was just a sign that let everyone know?

Yes. Whenever a stock market crashes, one can usually point to specific flaws in the economy that led to those crashes. Do remember that the stock market is a secondary market for shares. It doesn't actually affect the public corporations unless they intent to make sell additional shares. Yet a vast majority of credit for these firms comes from bonds, not public offerings.
 
 
I like America but not Bush.

It would affect their credit rating though but that's another story.

As an aside, when I referred to orthodoxy I was referring to the fact that it's the most often stated cause by the textbooks that these chaps have likely been reading. Anyway, you get the point.

I quoted two people from their books regarding American history, stating that I agree with their views. I'm not denying that others have different opinions. You didn't quote which historian takes your view, though I accept there'll be some. I never said I take the guy's opinion as sacred. Though I respect his view considering his work and professional research on the area.

 
Are you? Honestly, that would be laughable.
 

It would be. However you know I'm not arguing that. What I also think of as laughable is the overuse of ad absurdium. You know fine well that I never said the guy's opinion was sacred. You've stretched my words into something you want. It's unfair to put words in my mouth.

 
Evidently you haven't noticed that there's more than one argument for how and when the great depression started. Do you even read oposing views or do you just accept orthodoxy?
 

Of course. As you may have noticed, I go against the orthodox view of feminism, though I'm not a sexist and will debate for literally hours against anyone who states the contrary. Likewise I'm in favour of the death penalty and I'm a rare pro-lifer. I'm not the first to follow public opinion. Likewise, I'm not the first to be controversial, like 9/11 conspiracy theorists. Just because I happen to agree with one man's opinion (be it a historian or not) does not mean I believe they are God (certainly not, due to my religious beliefs) nor that I don't read anybody elses views. Learning is an integral part of debate. For instance, I've opened my eyes towards the drugs issue; something I thought I would always be against.

I just respect Tony Judt's judgement. That's all I'm saying. His way of arguing seems coherent and logical, if not a little wordy.

I wasnt arguing that the stock market crash appeared out of nowhere, i was saying that the impact it had accelerated existing problems into much worse ones. its illogical to say a stock market doesnt represent the market it trades within. But i disagree over its impact being negligable. Even if actual effects in figures wernt large, the physcological impact was. Im also not as much concerned with its intricate effects within the 30's depression as i am on its impact on other economies in the world through its impact in America.

Remember, the original argument was over America's influcence and lead in the world. Its not magnamimous, it only does things when its convienient for itself. That's fine, though less fine when your a superpower, but its not fine if you suggest that you are magnamimous and do genuinely care for other nations, which is what you seem to have suggested.

I always learnt that the crash was a catalyst for the more serious problems that came about.

Once again, we're talking about 1929, not 2007. Why would the psychological impact be large? A vast majority of Americans would never have heard of the stock market in 1929.

Given many of these comapnies would be involved with the stock market, their subsequent difficulties becasue of its crash would have symbolic importance, even if people didnt know what was causing their dificulties.

The sum invested in the stock market was tiny relative to the US economy. I doubt the crash had any real effect outside of New York and perhaps Chicago. And the average American was employed in farming...

Er, and what portion of the NYC skyline was around in 1929? You still fail to grasp that the companies whose stocks plummeted didn't suffer much as a result of the Crash.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_...an_Explanation 

As you can see, none of the main economic explanations of the Great Depression pay much attention to the Crash.
 
 
I really detest the government within the United States. All it has appeared to have done is to bring misery and suffering to many worldwide. Roll on the next presidential elections.

Given the system of fixed rates, there was no rescuing being done by anyone, only countries fulfilling their obligations and Gold convertibility.

Don't you dare try and palm any of your depression off on us Bis!

Or the USD from spiraling out of control.

What I'm mainly saying is that emotive rhetoric about 'collapsing this', 'climbing that', and 'rescuing the other' really annoys me when people talk about FX. It implies some kind correct price or that there is intrinsic merit (usually) in strong currencies. It's a sort of a socially constructed habit. If you get my drift.

Anyway, it's the wrong way to look at it in this example. The currencies were fixed. They couldn't move, they weren't pegged by open market operations, they were fixed. It was the fact that they were fixed that contributed to the declining reserves in the US. i.e. the Fed wasn't 'emptying their reserves' and the BoE filling their's (which was equally harmful by the way) in order to keep the rate fixed, the fixed rate was automatically causing the changes. There's a distinct difference. The former implies some kind of active role played by the Fed, when in reality it wasn't some act of benevolence but an automatic process that began as soon as they signed the rate agreement.

Just me splitting hairs really.

The language of economics is far from neutral... "strong" and "weak" currencies, "climbing" or "collapsing" share values; and even the more basic psychological connotations of a market being "up" or "down".

Except that the movements of a share price tell you something about the intrinsic strength of a company (note movement, not absolute price). The movements of currencies are a different kettle of fish, they aren't a judgment on the strength or otherwise of a country (or even the currency itself) but that's often what people conclude, they have more to do with relative interest rates than that.

Weak and Strong take on a technical meaning but people still assume some kind of emotive connection. For example, the Yen is one of the 'weakest' currencies out there, but it's easily one of the most influential and so is the Japanese economy. The GBP is 'stronger' than the USD but it's influence pales in comparison and the US economy is the 'strongest' by miles.

Gah, you probably get my point. It's a bit of pet hate.

Because they'd have had to redesign the entire world's exchange rate mechanism. They couldn't just exit on a whim, it wasn't an option.

Well, shall we start on identifying Indian and Chinese provinces and even cities, then? If we're going on population.

California GDP is roughly the size of Britain's.
 
 
Yes, but it's also true that many British school children didn't know who Hitler was, so let's not go down that route.

And it's terrifying that someone doesn't know where France is? Calm down a bit.
I do think it's a valid point that many Brits and continental Europeans who deride America so much would be unable to locate many states. No, they're not countries, per se, but then I'd imagine many British people scoff at the American inability to separate England, Wales and Scotland.

World history is far greater than american history, for someone not to be able to point out a country such as france is terrifying.

Is it true that many americans could not point out Iraq on a map?

 

That's rather odd seeing that many Brits I spoke to (who were in uni no less) didn't know about which countries fought on which side in WWI or who Lenin was.

Regardless of silly statistics about who can identify what on a map, I think it's safe to say that the US is somewhat more culturally isolationist than European countries.
 
 
Does it matter? You're obviously so bent on hating Americans and believing they're stupid that nothing is going to change your mind. You completely disregard the quality of their higher education and research institutes, their record in the Nobel Prizes and science, and instead focus on statistics about the average American not knowing about countries which are as distant from them as Central Asia is from us.
Out of curiousity, how much do you know about Uzbekistan?
 
 
Sorry, is Uzbekistan an important country to know about? I mean no offence to any Uzbeks posting here, but personally I'd be rather more anxious to educate American kids as to where France, Germany, Britain, China, India, Israel, Iraq, Iran, Afganistan, Vietnam and Korea are.
 
 
Fine then. How many British people are fully educated about any country outside of Europe? I daresay most people's knowledge of European countries stems from
a) WW1 and WW2 history lessons
b) Holidays

LSE, with all of them studying for Masters in either International Relations, History, or related fields.

"Fully educated"? Very, very few people are anywhere near "fully educated" even about one period in the history of one country.

You assume wrong. Americans are taught American and world history in junior high school, high school, and in university.

dont reply back unless you're going to answer ALL of these

 

Your low opinion of Americans is made apparent by your arguments thus far. If you weren't impinging American intelligence with your comments about the inability of some Americans to find countries, what were you hoping to do, exactly? It's clear what you attempt to infer, even if you don't directly state it.
If not Uzbekistan, how about a non European country not involved in either WW1 or WW2? Unless your school brushed on Vietnam or Korea, it's unlikely you'll have much knowledge of non European nations without researching them yourself.

The fact is that in American and outside America, there will be people with little interest or knowledge of the world. Living in Britain, next door to Europe, we obviously know where France is. Living in America, an ocean away, it's hardly surprising if fewer people know exactly where it is. I doubt such people represent the cream of the American crop in any case.

As far as I know, people in England and N. Ireland take A-levels, and people in Wales did until this year. I don't see why I shouldn't be allowed to say Brits, instead of listing three out of the 4 entities making up Britain.  

Seeing that Brits are supposed to be good at sarcasm, it's rather odd that you don't realize that that site is meant to be a joke.

Well, yes, because England, Wales, Scotland and NI constitute the UK, and the 50 states constitute the US. Given that the states are bigger than any country in the Union, I don't think it's an unreasonable comparison. The length of their existence doesn't matter when they've both existed since any of us were born.
If you expect an American to be able to name and locate the countries in the UK, you must be able to do the same with US states, especially as the US is a far more influential nation than the UK.

No, we are not only taught about American history. Did you know that United States scientists have received the majority of the Nobel Prizes in Science (Chemistry, Physics and Medicine) awarded since 1951? I'm tired of our schools being criticized by people in other countries using invalid test scores about geography. Forrest Gump can memorize a map in one afternoon, but that doesn't make him a genius.

You think Britain is currently more influential than the US, and you call Americans arrogant?

For a screen name like "love to learn", it seems that you aren't willing to learn anything about the U.S, and you have already made up your mind about us.

You seem far from neutral as you proclaim.  

Have you ever been to any place in the US?  

If so, what was your experience? How did you reach those conclusions?

Oh, I'm sorry, I thought we were discussing how influential America is, not whether it is the world's saviour?
American culture is endemic, The Simpsons is shown in almost every country, Communist Chinese school girls carried pictures of Clark Gable, and there's a Starbucks in the Forbidden City, and capitalism has spread in some form or another almost worldwide. Whether you think these are good or bad influences, you can not claim American culture is not influential.

Yes, people only commit crime because of rap music. Also, rap music is the only American music in this country.

No one is saying America is perfect, in fact, no one apart from you has passed moral judgement on the US so far.

Yes, many people arguing against you are from the US, but you'll notice they have not passed any moral judgement, good or bad, on the US. The only person so far to have made such a statement is you.

Are you stupid? You think gang members only carry guns because rap songs involve lyrics about violent crime? What the hell is "rap music with guns" anyway? They carry guns because they want to shoot people, and the violent streak does not originate in rap music, despite what the Daily Telegraph tells you.
 
 
I respect America and their culture. Although I may not agree with some policies, it is their country. Who are we to tell them how to run their country? Or to have as their president?

One of admiration I have of Americans is that they take no s*** from other people, unlike us. Slaves to bureaucratic powers in Brussels and the whole debacle of the Iran hostage. Iran wouldn't have dared to take American soliders hostage for two weeks. America is definitely number 2 on the list of places I would live if I ever left UK.

Every country has bad bits about their culture. There's no direct equivalent to chavs in the US. Do you want me to post a list of American Nobel Prize Winners? Or American inventions? You seem determined to ignore the good parts about American culture and focus only on the negatives, while ignoring the fact that every country has negative parts to their culture.

American culture is global. American economic influence is global and greater than any other nation's. They have the strongest, if not numerically largest, military. Show me any other country whose culture, for example, is more influential than America's. America has been the most influential nation in the West since the end of WW2, and in the world since the fall of the USSR
 
 
Dear God, can't you read? "They have the strongest, if not numerically largest, military" Not to mention the wiki article supports me as the USAF is the largest, as its navy, the combination of which makes its armed forces extremely potent.

So, with that out of the way, care to provide any actual arguments or will you just continue to employ diversionary tactics until I leave in disgust?
 
 
Yes, I can. Shall I repeat what I said for the third time? The US has the strongest military, but not the largest. How does the wiki article contradict me?
 
 
 
Originally Posted by love2learn7

He never said that. It's by far the most powerful military in the world.

Again, you don't notice any aspects of American culture. What are you typing on?
 
 
'They have the strongest, if not numerically largest military' - they have the strongest, even if it is not the largest. Simple.

My question was going to be: "So, you're saying that a nation that accounts for less than 2% of the worlds population is responsible for the usage of an item it didn't invent in a country that is an ocean away? And, that's not influential? I smell something fishy..."

But, the romance is lost.

I think the mods tend to shy away from deleting posts when they clearly show a man digging his own grave. However, there have been notable acceptions in the past, and some members have used their connections with moderators to wage counteroffensives, by claiming to be the victim of angry responses to their here-one-minute-gone-the-next vitriolic post.

Ireland is a massively catholic country, this is well known, having children out of wedlock is probably still a huge shame (not like over here, have a crackbaby and set yourself up in a nice council-paid home!). British laws are much more liberal, and the Irish law is pretty backwards. but at least people don't pray in tongues!

So that's a yes.
 
 
id just like to make a quick point. I think america is too controlling i.e. it wishes to have interests in every country, wishes to lead every political argument (even if it has nothing to do with them). I like america and its people (who i think are friendly, as ive been to america several times), but i strongly oppose the bush administration. I wonder what a man like Barak Obama will change if he gets the chance to become the next president.

It comes with the territory of being the most powerful nation in the world. Britain acted in the exactly same way prior to WWI.
 
 
As did the Turks at the height of the Ottoman empire, the Spanish in the 15/16th Century, and just about everyone else who has every been a superpower.
 
 
I can buy guitars cheaply from america at the moment, hence america = good.

Or at least our economy is.

Australia? Island-state? It's practically a continent!

Just because a country is small it doesn't make it any less viable for comparison though.

I'd stick with the USA beign 'one of' the freest countries in the world for now Bis.

I don't think a place can be the land of the free when it has virtually no people (referring to Singapore and Hong Kong). I think a key component of that term would be a place where people flee to avoid persecution and a place that fights on behalf on liberty (not necessarily using military force). Australia might do okay in those categories, but it can't really compare to the US.

Hong Kong has fulfilled that since it's inception, harbouring people and businesses fleeing from Communism in China. In fact they punch above their weight on the fighting for freedom (in a none military way) aspect as well, it's pretty much the unofficial home of the WTO and, dare I say it, capitalism.

oh well really! I think Australia is much more free than America, I'd feel comfortable and safe there, rather than a country where guns are considered the primary means of protection! I'd put America in a category with Israel and Japan, rather than Western Europe, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
besides, I'd say Singapore and Hong Kong can't be land of the free because in Singapore, you can still receive whippings for crimes like drug use and homosexuality, and I'm sure Hong Kong is still fairly strict on these sort of things, rather than its numerical make-up.
You seem to be confusing a free market and economic freedom with genuine civil liberty.

So Hong Kong helps people from one country, while the US allows in a million people from around the world every single year?
 
 
Well a little late but many of the Americans I meet I like, we have a lot in common and there is a diversity of ideas and culture that is laudible, never met an American I didn't like, sincerely.

Hate their government, for too many years it has been conservative, in a two party sate you need balance. Bush showed just how important balance between the x and the y is in any country. The best form of democracy is one that progresses, I haven't seen much evidence for a while, and I genuinely detest neocon mentality, it was insane to think that aggressive foreign policy would bring peace to the world, before 9-11 most neocons were considered crazy. Love the Americans hate their gov. Quite simply.

Bushes signing laws piss me off no end too, especially the one about allowing terrorists to face torture, friggin cruel and unusual punishment on a technicality! Taking democracy out of the hands of the people, why? Thank all that is holy that he's a lame duck now. And the sooner he's gone the better off the US will be IMO. Hope the US gets some useful politicians in the coming years, they certainly deserve it.

I respectfully ask this question:

Where else is owning a firearm a right?

Perhaps switzerland?

I think a better argument is: Americans are TOO free.

Hong Kong is great...Singapore...nice place to visit, but way too controlled...but still... very nice people, would visit again in a heartbeat.....

I kept getting told there...i'm from the land of "al Capone"...they all wondered how many of my neighbors were whisky runnin gangsters,,,,

Anyway, I obviously harbor no ill will toward Canadians, since I'm more often assumed to be Canadian than American.   I guess that happens when a pale person has great knowledge of hockey and an intense love of all things maple-derived.

The land of the free... the use of the definitive article implies that it is THE land of freedom in an exclusionary sense.

The indexes you posted are interesting, but I can't help but think that freedom, and indeed even the choices of metric to make up such an index, is an inherently subjective concept, so that an objective measurement of "freedom" is troublesome to say the least.

That might have something to do with the fact that the poem that first invoked those words was written in 1814, when the US was THE land of the free.

I think you'll find that the US comes out near the top in every single category.

Unless you were a woman, black or native american of course.

Regardless, whatever the genisis of the phrase, the phrase for many in the states these days tends to conjure up precisely the sort of notion that I spoke of... namely that the US is the undisputed world champion of freedom... not some hark back to a questionable historical reference.

I dont doubt it. The US is certainly one of the most free societies in the world. But ONE OF is very different to THE land of the free...

In truth, I dont think you would feel any less free living in say, Germany or the UK, than you would in the US... but again, its very much a question of what you are measuring.

Blacks and women didn't exactly have rights in Europe at the time either. A white man in the US was, however, more free economically and politically than his counterparts anywhere in the world. The world might have changed since then, but the "city upon a hill" mentality in the US never disappeared.

Germany lacks economic freedoms, and Britain is lacking in privacy. I think you'll also find that unlike much of Europe, the US isn't plagued by problems of unintegrated minorities and class envy.

There is virtually no "class consciousness" in the US. And Americans don't so much envy their neighbors as they motivate themselves to work harder to surpass them. I recall an article in the Times where a Frenchman said "whenever I see someone in a nice car, I can't help but hate the owner". When your average American sees a person in a nice car, they put in more overtime to buy that car for themselves.

Certainly blacks didnt do too well elsewhere, nor did women.

However, the US lagged behind most developed nations in regard to rights for both then, and for decades to come.

And gay men are free to marry, and censorship is less... prostitution is permitted in the Netherlands... germans probably enjoy more privacy than US citizens...

My point is simple - the notion of the US out front leading the pack in terms of freedom is simply not an accurate or definitively verifiable fact.

As to class envy and ethnic minorities - racial tension between blacks and whites in the developed world is probably greater in the US than anywhere in western Europe, and though we can dispute the existinence of "class" envy between the haves and have nots is not at all uncommon in the US. However, I dont really see that that relates much to legal or economic freedoms.

Agreed. Just look at the likes of the Rodney King and OJ cases. America's black and white communities seem very polarised to me. And wasn't segregation active in the US until dates past anywhere in Europe?

Interesting that both examples are widely the result of the LAPD being utterly terrible.

How do you figure? Women got the right to vote in the US at roughly the same time as they did in Europe, and unlike in places like Britain, they didn't have to be 30 and married...

Gay marriage is hardly a right that's needed for liberty to prosper. I'm a supporter myself, but it ranks pretty low on the list of rights a person should possess. I don't know about Germans and privacy (I doubt the right to privacy is as fundamental to their legal system as it is to ours), but the point is that the US near the top in every category. Surely someone who's #2 in every category (for example) is better than someone who's #1 in some and number #20 in others.

Considering that blacks have historically made up as much as a quarter of the US population (12% now), I think race relations are pretty good when you compare that to countries in Europe who have problems with minorities that make up 5% of the population. I think the fact that our unions are thoroughly depoliticized, that we never had a strong social democratic party, and that the political divide is based more on moral issues than on economic ones all suggest that class as a concept does not exist in the US. As for how this relates to freedom, as you yourself said, a country isn't free when a significant minority of its population don't have the same rights (and I'd add economic power to that) as the majority.

Name a European country that had a 15-20% non-European minority in the 1960s. Now that some countries in Europe do have such a minority, I don't see much social harmony in those places. I mean, Germany wasn't able to integrate even a small portion of its Turkish population in several decades now.

I hate saying it to you, as we're friends, but the people born in the US in the 1960s were all American and just varied by their ethnicities. As such, your remark somewhat implies that the descendants of African slaves were more foreign than the descendants of the European immigrants to the US.

Wasn't that due to Islam rather than race though?

What about  this one  that you posted on the Taiwan thread. Joint 53rd with Botswana, Tonga and Croatia, that's a pretty poor showing Bis.

Not to mention  being  toward the bottom end of the most developed nations for Corruption. Only 7.3 (=20th) compared to (for example) the UK (8.6 =11th) Singapore (9.4 5th) or Finland, Iceland and New Zealand (9.6 =1st).

As a composite picture of:

the freedoms of:

A) blacks and
B) women
C) compared to the rest of the developed world

the US was by no means a leader, regardless of comparisons in relation merely to the universal vote in the UK and the provisos set.

My point was again, not to paint the US as a backwater of bigotry relative to an elightened and relaxed western europe, but to disagree with the concept of the US as a leader on such freedoms.

 
Gay marriage is hardly a right that's needed for liberty to prosper. I'm a supporter myself, but it ranks pretty low on the list of rights a person should possess.
 

I think many gay people would disagree. I think sexual freedom is very much a core freedom. However, again, its a composite picture and that was but one example of many.

Again, I would question the methodology here. I am not saying its necessarily faulty, but these concepts are not objective in nature.

Still, I dont really agree that the US fits the hypothetical comparison you specify when compared to the rest of the developed world.

 
Considering that blacks have historically made up as much as a quarter of the US population (12% now), I think race relations are pretty good when you compare that to countries in Europe who have problems with minorities that make up 5% of the population.
 

"have problems" is not really exact now is it?

The fact remains that there is far more racial tension in the US than in say, the UK between blacks and whites. There may be reasons for this, but the fact remains.

Would you disagree that race is a far greater issue in the US?

It isnt due really to numbers, its due to a legacy of slavery.

 
I think the fact that our unions are thoroughly depoliticized, that we never had a strong social democratic party, and that the political divide is based more on moral issues than on economic ones all suggest that class as a concept does not exist in the US.
 

Again, it depends very much on what you define as "class". However, i dont really think, it matters.

 
As for how this relates to freedom, as you yourself said, a country isn't free when a significant minority of its population don't have the same rights (and I'd add economic power to that) as the majority.
 

I simply dont, on the whole, see being rich as having greater rights. Not unless you equate rights with options.

Not even greater legal rights? I don't know about here, but it seems in America the rich can buy their way out of legal trouble whilst the poor are screwed.

I would agree it happens... but overall, I dont think that we can equate a disparity in economic wealth (which the US I would imagine without googling it would have a greater degree of) with a lack of "freedom" so to speak.

And once again, that's not really relevant since most of the "civilized" world didn't care about the rights of blacks and women. Sad, but true. When you add the fact that the US government was incredibly small, the American people were the most free in the world.

Not allowing gay marriage does not magically keep gays from having relationships with each other. Not being able to have your marriage recognized by the state is hardly the end of the world.

The UK never had to deal with a non-European minority that made up to a quarter of its population. As things stand, the UK is having far larger problems with the 1-2% of its population that's Pakistani than the US is having the 12% of its population that's black.

It depends on why certain groups are richer. For example, a large reason for why French Arabs are poor is because of discrimination (though they share the blame).

True, but Britain did abolish slavery first, and use its navy to make others follow suit, whereas the practice in the US continued until the Civil War. I'm aware that we played a large role in instigating the slave trade, but still

Ill admit it was a tangential point, but in there is certainly a case to be made, that during the 1800s and early 1900s, the US was NOT, taking into account the plight of blacks, women, and other minorities, THE Land of the free.

 
Not allowing gay marriage does not magically keep gays from having relationships with each other. Not being able to have your marriage recognized by the state is hardly the end of the world.
 

Of course it isnt the end of the world. And neither is, in my mind, a larger number of CCTV cameras. However, it is, as said, part of a composite picture, and is certainly a "minus" in the freedom column of the US.

 
The UK never had to deal with a non-European minority that made up to a quarter of its population. As things stand, the UK is having far larger problems with the 1-2% of its population that's Pakistani than the US is having the 12% of its population that's black.
 

I dont really see what the historical explanation has to do with it?

Your point was:

 
the US isn't plagued by problems of unintegrated minorities...
 

I simply diagreed and pointed to the large degree of racial tension between blacks and whites in the US; I havent even begun to talk about the large swathes of the country that you cant get about in without spanish.

Yes, there are historical, geographic, and cultural reasons for that. I am not blaming the US, or anyone for that matter. I am merely pointing out that the US actually has, to my mind, mor problems on the whole with integration and racial issues than the UK and most of Europe.

 
It depends on why certain groups are richer. For example, a large reason for why French Arabs are poor is because of discrimination (though they share the blame).
 

And American blacks would say the same I'm sure.

America is a big, boring, souless country full of fat, boring, workshy, kid-obsessed, loud people - isolated from reality and with the collective brainpower of a slug. Sorry if that causes offence but that's pretty much my summation after 6 years living in the place. Having said that, no Brit should feel smug since the the UK is itself a complete pissoire and has nothing much to sing about either.

I don't want or need sophistication. Sophistication and the pretense that comes with it bores me to tears. I don't want to talk about Blake's poetry. All I want is to meet people who are intelliegent enough to have a half decent conversation and drink with - and be able to light up a malboro without being looked at like I've just crawled out from under a stone. (PS - Utah is pretty "intellectual" aamof - a very wealthy state that places high priority on education)

No, and no. The LAPD totally wrecked the investigation. Most of the physical evidence was compromised. Chains of custody weren't kept properly and photography from the scene showed that the police obviously tampered with some of the evidence (Ex: photos of the woman's body showed drops of blood on her back, but the blood drops were not present in later photographs. However, there was no submission of swabs to be tested for DNA.). Consequently, the majority of the evidence that was permissible in court was only circumstantial. There was nothing to pin the crime on him scientifically.

Again, the LAPD are about the world's crappiest police department. If this takes place in any other metro area, it's probably going to result in a better investigation that isn't harmed by evidence tampering. Having thoroughly studied the case, it would be almost impossible for one to ethically claim he was guilty based on the evidence presented in court.
 
 
Just a little point against the "Americans have an evil stupid president who they love" BS I see on TSR all the time:
 http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?p...efer=worldwide 

 
Bush's approval rating fell to 28 percent this week, the lowest since a similar score by President Jimmy Carter in 1979, the year of the Iran hostage crisis. The poll also found that 71 percent of Americans are dissatisfied with the way things are going in the U.S.

Almost two-thirds of those polled, 62 percent, said that Bush's actions in Iraq showed he was ``stubborn and unwilling to admit his mistakes,'' the survey said. The poll also showed that all three leading Democratic contenders beat their Republican counterparts in head-to-head competition among registered voters.
 
 
 
Wow, this thread is fascinating. Just remember we're not one giant homogenous mass of right-wing Christian fundamentalist Bushers, just like not all Brits are friendly, tea-sipping, fun, open-minded, intellectuals (as I fantasize).

Many of us Americans are thoughtful, levelheaded, worldly people. I guess we're just not as vocal as the "other side" seems to be - the horrible, obnoxious Republicans, who are in bed with big business and spend a ridiculous amount of energy trying to deny the fact that "climate change" is taking place. As you well know, America is an extremely divided place. Actually, the general thrust of the opinions about America/Americans describe how I tend to view the South and most Republicans (which I know is a distorted outlook).

I can tell you there is a huge population of Americans who are fed up with the type of people many of you seem to describe - the capitalist, dominant, "we're the greatest," aggressive foreign politics, lack of awareness of different cultures people. We recognize and are terrified and embarrassed by our government's glaring problems and Bush's foreign policy.

As to the several comments about American girls being "sluts," I find that quite interesting. British humor seems to be often very sexual, and while I haven't been to the UK, I know that Europe in general is much more sexually open than in America (in France there was porn everywhere) and we're considered prudes. So maybe it is simply that we are victims of your charming British accents, and that tends to make us act out of character...

A very thoughtful and level headed post..
 
 
Well, it was a lighthearted post. But thanks for taking it so seriously..
 
 
I think America has some very interesting policies (not in a good way!) They seem to go very over the top on everything. I mean 9-11, how have they improved security?...By taking away privacy and rights of those living in the country.... urrr... that works how? So great, they now know what my eye looks like and have my fingerprints, they know I goto Florida every other year and that I stay in the same Hotel, clearly the signs of a terrorist. The American government are bullies, everyone is bullied to do it their way and if they don't agree then a war is unleashed on them.

I hate to stereotype, but Americans really do shine out their own backsides, I know some Americans personally, and they seem OK, but as a nation, they just appear to think they are the best and appear narrowminded about a lot of issues.

Rather ironic for someone from the land of CCTV to accuse America of not protecting privacy.
 
 
Ah of course we have our faults, our government wanted to introduce ID Cards, which is a rediculous idea. I just think some of the things America has done since 9-11 haven't exactly benefited the country, more made them more of a target. The only people loosing out aren't the terrorists - but the civilians of the country.

Not everything is that black and white. I think climate change is a not due to man made CO2, I'm very well-travelled, love capitalism but I'm sure as hell no christian fundamentalist. A church's walls would crumble if I ever set foot in one.

This is always true; the extreme views grab the headlines and lead to a distorted impression of the whole. See also: Islam.

It's not so much "sluts" as that from my experience, Americans in general, of both genders, are much more open about sexual humour than Brits.
 
So maybe it is simply that we are victims of your charming British accents, and that tends to make us act out of character...
 

I can vouch for this

Have you seen the state of our country? I think you should look at ours first before you start criticising America's. At least they have the bill of rights which protects the rights of all citizens of America and limit the powers of the federal government.

Whereas in this country where we have constant state intervention into our private lives. Council officers are legally, under British law, allowed to walk into your home and garden without any prior arrangement. Not to mention the fact that it will be illegal in 2010 to not have an ID card.
 
 
is it true that american girls have a reputation for being easy? Casual sex seems as normal as getting groceries in LA.
 
 
As it is in parts of Britain. I don't think it's easy to make broad generalisations in this regard.

Average age to lose virginity in Britain is 16-17. The average age in the US is 18. So if anything, it's the other way around. Plus seeing drunk American girls every night is far from a regular occurrence, while it seems to happen in Britain with alarming frequency.
 
 
Averages can be skewed a long way by a few extreme data. I think this is certainly the case here...
 
 
were you get those stats bismarck? And its not really losing virginity thats the point, its how much they get it after the first time. What im saying is, is it relativly easy to score some in NY or LA? Like over here, Liverpool girls are pretty easy, but London ones tend to be more hard work.
 
 
I think the term is "   "
 
 
Well its pretty common knowledge that people are more sexually liberal in LA than most other places - it isnt the porn capital of the world for nothing, so i was wondering if the average woman is more 'liberal' in regard to sex there. Stats dont really prove things unless its neighbourhood/town based, since im sure small towns the mid west or whereever have far higher averages than deprived areas in big cities. Even round by me, teenage pregnancy rates are really high, but you go to south liverpool to where my auntie lives and they plumit.

I also think, at least on the media, which obviously isnt a totally accurate representation of reality, that American girls are easier, or at least come across as easier.

Actually porn doesn't tend to go along with sexual liberalism. It's most popular in some of the most sexually repressed places.

Maybe politically, but culturally we are on different planets. Two nations divided by a common language.

You are right about American girls.

but its easiest to be based in a sexually liberal place, even if the people who come to work in it are from elsewhere. It would be illogical to set up a porn studio right in an evangelical heartland.

I'll find out how easy NY hoochie is to bag when im in New York in the summer, i was just wondering if any cities have 'reputations', coz Liverpool has a bit of a rep for easy girls, and girls that all look like footballers wives.

OK, enough already. This is Chat-level stuff. Let's keep it at least medium-brow.
 
 
Like its medium brow anyway. One person says all Americans are culturally deficient, and then Bismarck shoots back with how it is really Britain that is culturally deficient.

There's my pet hate again, Brits using yank slang.
 
 
oh, sorry old chap, didnt mean to offend.

"Your people are culturally deficient" is at least a better calibre of insult than "your girls are easy"...

But realistically, Britain's culture does dwarf that of the United States. It has a grounding in history that America simply lacks. In decades and centuries to come this may very well cease to be the case, but as things stand at the moment America's cultural visionaries (Whitman, Barber, Armstrong...) unfortunately represent mere flashes in the pan.
 
 
Can anyone tell me why American academics, in the field of History at least, have such a bad rep? I guess I should know since i study it, but whenever somthing gets written by an American its treated suspitiously becasue American history books are seen as superfiicual and absolute. This might just be British academics displaying arrogance, but the best history writings on, say, Germany, are usually by British people and Germans. Same goes for France. And they're not just the best becsue they're written in English and so English historians get moreexposure to them, British Historians like Ian Kershaw are treated by Germans too as being awesome Historians on Germany. Now you cant say 'well thats a no brainer becasue Britain is in Europe and so is France and so its all the same' becasue thats simply not the case. Superficially it might seem so, but French culture and history, when looked into properly, is just as different from British culture as it is American culture, yet American academics on European history seem to be few, and ****.

Two examples of American histoians displaying pretty dump academic quality are Daniel Goldhagen (I.E. every single German LIKED killing Jews) and Robert Gellately.

Can't find the US one, but I remember reading a BBC article that said the age in the US is 18.

May I just ask, do you mean they can come into your home, with a garden outside, or hat they are permitted to enter your home and start planting azaleas?

You're thinking of  San Fernando Valley , which is where a lot of porn films are shot. I think it's adjacent to LA, but wouldn't really be considered to be the same thing. Also, the type of people who are producing pornography are not necessarily representative of the average person in LA.
 
 
And from personal experience, the average girl in LA weigh at least 20 pounds more than the average girl in New York, so I doubt they're as obsessed with their looks as Hollywood would have people believe...

Word of advice, don't even talk about that idea to Native Americans. They tend to get very annoyed when individuals suggest that nothing happened in the Americas until Westerners arrived to write things down in English.

Maybe because Europeans would sooner trust their own to understand European history than people from other continents? Also, there may be some anti-semitism, or skepticism, toward the number of Jews, or descendants of Jews, when they write about topics like Nazi Germany. Also, I think it may have something to do with the idea that people try to be fairly close what they study, since that is where most source material is available to them. So, the greater experts in European history would congregate in Europe, and the greater experts in American history would tend to be in America.

Maybe NYers can hide it better because of they actually get to have winter clothes, and they also tend to dress more professionally. The Beach Boys said it best: "East Coast girls are hip, I really dig the styles they wear."

When I said garden, I meant people's private back gardens. Council tax inspectors will soon be entitled by law (and are legally already in N.Ireland) to enter anyone's home and take photos to analyse how much council tax people should pay.

Having a 'good view' or a conservatory can end up costing people more. And If people don't "reasonably assist" then they will £1000 plus £200 every day after that. Plus you'll get a police record too.

Hah, I've seen girls with clothes that reveal their stomaches in January.
 
 
Maybe 20 lbs heavier is a good thing since many new york girls are about 10-15lbs underweight.

Why continents? If they’re not going to discriminate nationality wise then they aren’t going to continent wise are they? I mean, given two major continents, North America and Ocenania, both speak English, it would surely be even easier to get a hold of and review good academic stuff from those countries than it is from France or Germany. If your good at history, your good at is regardless of the place you’re studying. Just because I come from Europe doesn’t mean I have a better idea of how Europe was 300 years ago than someone from America, we both didn’t live then. And given American culture is pretty much the product of enlightenment European culture, its not even the same difference as, say, us trying to study African history.

I also don’t think its anti-Semitism, its just what’s happening. There are a lot of Jewish historians with baggage that go to investigate the holocaust, and their emotional attachment shows in their works. Its not the fact they’re simply Jews, since there are a number of very good Jewish historians even on the Holocaust and Nazi Germany, its just that there genuinely are Jewish historians who have some sort of goal to distort the holocaust. I’m surprised at Goldhagen, given the Nazis aimed to kill all Jews and didn’t discriminate between them, you’d think he’d be less likely to commit the same injustice of tarring everyone with the same brush in regard to the German public under Nazism.

Source material is an ambiguous one. Source material for sale usually goes to the highest bidder, and thus would end up in the USA. Also, geographical location is hardly prohibitive to getting information nowadays. Russian communist primary sources that came to light after the unification of Germany are just as easy to get hold of by American historians as they are European ones.

It might be because American academics are very American-centric that none of the good ones bother looking outside their own countries history, which wouldn’t be surprising. You’d think they would though since, especially in historical terms, America is the product of European history – they have just a good a reason to study European history as I, as a British person, do.

The top IR scholars regularly write about Europe. The current international system is said to have started in Europe, and they all start their analysis from the way Europe operated when that system was created. Most reference to the major European wars of the last 4 centuries when writing about current events. Waltz, the top IR scholar over the last generation, wrote a book comparing the domestic systems of Britain and the US. Mearsheimer, probably one of the top 3 scholars today, regularly wrote about European integration. It seems to me that you're only looking at American history books and then wonder why they're American-centric.

We must travel in different circles then. If anything, girls in London (and Paris from what I heard) are far skinnier than the girls here...

Isn't our culture based on yours though? I don't really see how you can argue that the US is culturally deficient when we share the same language, measurements, history, etc. Our entire judicial system and its principles are based on British common law. Look at our seventh amendment in our constitution and you'll see that it refers to the right of a trial by jury without even bothering to define what a jury is.

Regarding the British men/American women thing...I think it just comes down to American women finding the accent sexy for some reason. That makes it easier for a guy with a UK accent (it really doesn't matter what part of the UK) to sleep with an American girl because he's got "an angle" right off the bat.

I find it funny being on these forums reading about how Americans all supposed to be religious nutjobs, but the girls here are sluts. Which one is it?

IR is very different form actual historical investigation. When i say there are hardly any Americans of good repute, i mean that when you look for good books on certain topics, lets say the rise of hitler since thats fairly modern, there are hardly any Americans who write anything any good about it. And its not as if im limiting myself looking for things in English there either given Americans speak english, and given if somthing written by a German is good it gets translated quickly, so the 'Anglo centric' argument doesnt apply. The further you go back the less and less common it becomes. Regardless of whether the history is 'relevent' to America or not (and relevence to your own nation doesnt have much to do with historical investigation), considering Americans laugh at places like Oxford and then say how much more cash and 'better' professors American uni's like Harvard have, they dont seem to produce much of value in terms of History. I wonder what % of History papers America produced in 2006

Just out of curiousity, do you have like 'the Harvard History of America' or anything in the USA?

I don't read history textbooks. Their only purpose is to teach the basics to people who know absolutely nothing. You probably only read the books that are most available in Britain, which would explain the lack of American authors. I'm far from a specialist in history, but I know people like Marc Trachtenberg are considered among the best in their field, and they write mostly about Europe.

I could give you a link to the top History journals. Nearly all are American, and most of the articles are by American authors...
 
 
 
I find it funny being on these forums reading about how Americans all supposed to be religious nutjobs, but the girls here are sluts.
 

I think its silly suggest you ALL are. To me places like LA symbolise Liberty taken to its fullest extent. Parts of America remind me of Rome in terms of peoples' vices and liberties. I think what most people are saying is that relgious nutjobs seem to be more numerous over there, and that religion, especially conservative aspects of relgion such as evangelicalism and pentecostalism, have greater prominence there. I guess in the Bush administration it also has a bigger role in government, but its not as if all people are a mirror image of the govt is it?

I think you told me this before. I wasnt thinking about how easy they are in relation to brits, i was just thinking in relation to your own folk.

As for 'culture', I sort of measure that more in novels or popular culture or plays. Perhaps modern media has led to the 'watering down' of literary achievenemnt, but its not as if Hollywood as produced much in terms of film that will go down in history as an awesome cultural achievement. People like Marylin Monroe are famous not for being genious, but just for being pretty. There are obviously some films, like saving private ryan, that are fantastic, but a lot of what gets produced by hollywood is self congratulatory garbage.

If 1% of America's films were good, that would still mean there are far more good American films than British films...

Sorry man, when i say textbooks i just mean books. they can be proper investigations by people, i just call them all the same thing. Sorry bout that. I'm talking books written on pretty small historical periods written by professors.

In terms of European history, theres not an American equivilant of somelike like AJP Taylor, who wrote classic texts on British, German and even pan european history. At the same time though, European history, i.e. studying Europe as a whole, can never by THAT good anyway becasue its too broad, and implicit in its study is trying to relate different nations to eachother, that inevitabley fabricates parts of history for convienience.

Who says these history journals are top?

But as a proportion of your own budget? Its hardly somthing to brag about saying we created 1% of good stuff with a budget of 1,000,000,000 dollars or whatever.

In terms of 'old' cultural things, i.e. authors and playwrites, i dont think anyone can compare with Britian. But of course, that also has to do with history. We obvioulsy have a larger back log of people. The only people who can compare to the British in that sphere are the Classical and Archaic Greeks.

I doubt either of us knows the academic field of history enough to debate this issue.

Journals are judged by how often its articles are cited by the top scholars/journals. And I'm sure you'll get some general agreement in the profession about what the top journals are.

 
But as a proportion of your own budget? Its hardly somthing to brag about saying we created 1% of good stuff with a budget of 1,000,000,000 dollars or whatever.
 

That's irrelevant. You can't measure culture by per capita indicators. If the US has 10 great movies and the UK has 1, then by your own definition, the US has more culture. Did Luxembourg have a better culture than the UK in the 19th century, despite having a population that's 200 times less?
 
 
Its not irrleevant at all. Of course 'classic films' are highly subjective, but considering the USA a massive industry dedicated to creating films, most of what it produces is ****e. Ironcially enough, one of the most sucsessful films of modern times came from New Zeland in the Lord of the Rings. If you want to 'compare' in a hugely flawed way, then if you take the dominant media forms of when Britian was prominent, that is the late 18th and 19thC, the amount of classics it produced in terms of novels and plays is pretty decent. But America's prominence during the New Media of films and TV shows has been far less. Even if you dont want to compare that way, Edgar Allen Poe gets bitch slapped by Dickens. Taking singular instances and comparing them is very subjective, but comparing literary achievenemnts en mass is less so, and i think Britian owns in that respect.

 
I doubt either of us knows the academic field of history enough to debate this issue.
 

you dont need to be that savvy, becasue really great authors or investigators end up becoming known outside of intellectual circles. I was also commenting on the general consensus amoung teachers that American historical literature is somthing to keep away from. I guess ill know more when (if) i go to Oxford.

So are you actually claiming that the true measure of culture is the amount of great books/films per capita?

No, the authors who write books for a mass audience tend to be well known outside of academia. That doesn't mean they're any good at their subject; merely that they could write to the lowest common denominator.
