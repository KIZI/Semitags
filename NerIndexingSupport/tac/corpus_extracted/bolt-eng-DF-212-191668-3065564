The Mandarin Offensive
Inside Beijing's global campaign to make Chinese the number one language in the world.
By Michael Erard

A light snow is falling outside the windows of Cyrus H. McCormick School in southwest Chicago, but the second graders in Room 203 are not distracted from their lesson. May Cheung, an energetic teacher from Hong Kong, holds a cup to her lips and asks, "Wo he shemma?" (What am I drinking?) A forest of arms go up. "Cha! Cha!" (Tea!) An hour later, Cheung has kindergartners counting to 27 in Mandarin as she hands out Chinese New Year hong bao, the red envelopes that promise wealth, abundance, and good fortune. For most of the kids in this Mexican-American neighborhood, Mandarin is their third language - after Spanish and English.

The children at McCormick are part of the largest grade school Chinese program in the US. Seven years ago, after a post-college stint teaching English in China, Robert Davis wandered into the offices of the Chicago Public Schools and convinced the director to start a comprehensive Chinese language program and hire him to manage it. Now 3,500 Chicago kids, from kindergartners to 12th graders, learn Mandarin. "The days of everybody trying to be American are over," Davis says. "When you do business with or go to other countries, be prepared to work on their terms."

Far from Chicago - 6,597 miles to the west, to be exact - Ma Jianfei is pointing at a huge map on the wall of a plush meeting room in an otherwise dreary building in Beijing. Ma is the deputy director general of the National Office for Teaching Chinese as a Foreign Language, better known as Hanban, and the map chronicles his success exporting Mandarin around the world. The map shows that the hottest markets for Mandarin are Thailand and South Korea, where all elementary and middle schools will offer Chinese by 2007. Europe, particularly* France and Germany, is also doing well, thick with yellow circles (teachers), red triangles (test facilities), and blue squares (language centers).

There aren't many shapes in the US yet, but Ma is working on that. For the past two years, Hanban has been collaborating with the College Board, the nonprofit that runs the SAT and the Advanced Placement program; in 2007, high school kids across the US will be able to take the first ever AP exam for Chinese language and culture (this year they're prepping for the test in new College Board-accredited classes). In October, Ma was in the American heartland, inking an agreement to open a Confucius Institute, a center for Chinese language learning and cultural studies, at the University of Kansas. It'll be the sixth in the US, the 41st in the world. Soon there will be 100 such institutes worldwide.

Mandarin Chinese is already the most popular first language on the planet, beating out English by 500 million speakers. And it's the second-most-common language on the Internet. Now, just as China requires students to learn English, Beijing wants to make Chinese the must-take language for English speakers - and everyone else. Ma figures there are currently 30 million people around the world learning Chinese as a second language. Hanban aims to increase that to 100 million over the next four years.

It's an audacious goal, and the government is backing it by funding - to the tune of nearly $25 million a year - the teaching of Chinese as a foreign language. Last year, Hanban sent 1,042 volunteer teachers to France, Kazakhstan, the Philippines, Vietnam, Mauritius, Nigeria, Colombia, and 16 other countries. This year, it will top that number.

Hanban provides schools, centers, and Confucius Institutes with seed money, textbooks, and game-based learning software. College kids and adults play Great Wall Chinese, while middle school students get a game called Chengo Chinese, which Hanban developed through a partnership with the US Department of Education. Nearly 15,000 American kids in 20 states helped beta-test the game, and it's now used in Mandarin classes offered through the accredited Michigan Virtual High School.

Beijing isn't doing anything different from what the British or the Americans or the French have done - sending emissaries abroad to spread its language and culture. It's not the first time the Chinese have pushed their native tongue, either: In the 17th and 18th centuries, imperial China brought several Chinese languages to much of Southeast Asia. But this 21st-century push is more global in scope, as befits an emerging world power. "This is the linguistic equivalent of sending a person to the moon," says Oded Shenkar, a professor at the Ohio State University and author of The Chinese Century.

Chinese bureaucrats take their evangelism seriously. The country is "merging into the world," Zhang Xinsheng, China's deputy minister of education, explained to reporters before the first World Chinese Conference last June. The event attracted diplomats and teachers from 65 countries - all there to partake in China's efforts to export Mandarin. "China, as the mother country of the language, shoulders the responsibility of promoting [the language] and helping other nations to learn it better and faster."

Chinese authorities also see spreading Chinese as an important part of the country's "peaceful rise," says Elizabeth Economy, the director for Asia Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, a New York foreign-policy think tank. This was the philosophy articulated in 2003 by China's president, Hu Jintao. China wants to emerge as a global power without threatening global security. "I think the Chinese have been very careful and thoughtful about assuaging the fears of the rest of the world," says Economy. "There's a benign element of the language work: to help educate."

One of the people most responsible for providing that help is Zhang Yi. Over the past three years, she's been to South Africa, Thailand, Japan, and Canada on business - not bad for a 24-year-old government employee. Trained as a lawyer, she coordinates Hanban's volunteer teacher program, selecting, training, sending, and supporting the agency's pool of 10,000-plus volunteer instructors. Like missionaries, these full-time teachers receive no pay, only a small stipend from Hanban. Most are young women who sign on to see the world - and sow the seeds of Chinese along the way.

As a young cosmopolitan Beijinger, Zhang Yi celebrates Christmas and prefers coffee over tea, so when we meet one frigid evening in Haidian (China's Silicon Valley), she picks Starbucks. Zhang marvels at the remarkable popularity of her native language outside China - it's something European newspapers like to call "Chinese fever," or hanyu re. Zhang sees evidence of Chinese fever all the time. In Bangkok, her waiters spoke Chinese. In Jakarta, she helped a Korean traveler who couldn't speak Indonesian or English, only Chinese. She recently had dinner with three professors from Beijing who had just been in Cuba, where they met students who were learning Chinese. Zhang is delighted to see the language taking hold in all these places. "That's why we are feeding the fire," she says.

Back in Chicago, Robert Davis is fanning the flames, but he isn't asking for volunteers. He wants teachers who'll stay, not leave after a year or two. So Hanban gave him $70,000 to build a Confucius Institute at Walter Payton College Prep; it also sends him free software and books. This spring, the new institute will begin providing grade school instructors with teaching materials and lesson plans, and it will offer how-to seminars for parents who want to help their kids with Chinese homework.

If Hanban exports Chinese around the world, then the main American importer is Gaston Caperton. He looks like Bill Clinton - though thinner - and speaks, once he gets talking, with an unchecked southern accent.

Caperton caught his own version of Chinese fever on his third visit to the country in 1994, when he was governor of West Virginia and traveling to China as part of an international trade mission. Expecting to return to the raw, poor country he'd seen in the 1980s, he instead found people drinking Coca-Cola and using com*puters, and the hotel was as lavish as any in the West.

Normally you'd find him in New York at the College Board, where he's president and unofficial promoter for Chinese-language education. But ever since the AP Chinese course was established, he's been on the road, trying to solve the shortage of qualified Chinese teachers in the US by prodding American universities to offer certification programs and persuading elementary schools and colleges stateside to offer more Chinese language classes. He's recently been in Beijing, meeting with Hanban officials about their volunteer-teacher program. But today he's in Shanghai with his wife, Idit Harel Caperton. She spent the fall teaching software engineering at a university here and is a consultant and major investor (along with MIT's Nicholas Negroponte) in a language software company based in China.

The College Board is among the few organizations that can have national impact in a public school system where most decisions are made at the local level. So Gaston Caperton hopes that the Chinese AP will spur interest in the language in high schools - and even trickle down to elementary schools. "The future is in Asia, and we have to know Asian languages," he says. The point is to keep the US competitive. Learning Chinese isn't just a way for Americans to get jobs in China, but for them to do business with Chinese companies and compete with Mandarin speakers from other countries.

Hanban contacted Caper*ton in 2004. At first, the Chinese government was frustrated by the fragmented US public school system. "They said to me, 'In China, we made English the second language,'" Caperton says. "'So why don't you just make it happen in the US?'"

Caperton is working to spread Chinese however he can. After becoming president of the College Board in 1999, he urged the organization to offer courses and exams in more languages. Given the importance of standardized tests, decisions by the College Board inevitably filter down to high schools and even elementary schools. Hanban also wanted to import the curriculum they'd developed directly into US schools. But Caperton persuaded them to abandon their one-size-fits-all approach. The Chinese were "aggressive" about helping, he says. After speaking for a few moments, Caperton backtracks and changes aggressive to progressive. What's the difference? "Progressive is moving forward and up. Aggressive is simply getting what you want."

Alexander Feldman saw this behavior firsthand when, as the US government's coordinator for international information programs, he was touring a new library at the State Institute for Islamic Studies of North Sumatera in Indonesia. On the third floor, an "American corner" was stocked with books, magazines, and computers with Internet access. Feldman suggested to the university's chancellor that videoconference equipment be installed in the empty space next to the corner. That's a good idea, the chancellor said. But about a month after the American corner was built, the Chinese were here and proposed a Chinese corner, which would sit right next to yours and have more resources than yours, he said. "There is a bit of friendly competition," Feldman mused later. "Competition is a good thing, both in business and in public diplomacy."

Several things wrong with this article. Take out China and the number of Mandarin speakers drop dramatically (duhhhh????). Outside China, does anyone need to speak Mandarin? It was not all that long ago that people told me that I should be learning Japanese instead of French. Well, I've used French in my travels a 1000 times more often than I was required to speak the few pick up words of Japanese.
 
 
col yu,

well, the article is coming from a business-oriented sense, and not so much a cultural-sense:

"The point is to keep the US competitive. Learning Chinese isn't just a way for Americans to get jobs in China, but for them to do business with Chinese companies and compete with Mandarin speakers from other countries."

in other words, it's not exactly an attempt to knock off english as the number one world language (a hard thing to do, given america's pre-eminence in the world, added to the historical impact of english-speaking peoples on the rest of the world).

so...the main focus, especially for the funders of this project, is to get people to speak chinese to do easier business with the chinese.

as for japanese, honestly, that was a flash in the pan. both in terms of influence and the economy that influence came from. japanese has some 125 million speakers (and even larger majority of that being japan's japanese, given that overseas japanese is actually a fairly small pop). japan's population is predicted to shrink precipitiously in the next 25-40 years due to aging and some of the world's most restrictive immigration/citizenship policies, which means barring some unforeseen great advances on part of the japanese in terms of labor efficiency, their economic might is going down. certainly relatively, and it's not unimaginable for it to go down in absolute terms, as well. france, on the other hand, still has the "benefit" of having been an imperialist power- foreign french speakers actually vastly outnumber the natives.

china now, china is in a whole 'nother ballpark. china's population is not only a magnitude larger than japan OR france's population, its immigrant population around the world number 60 million. and unlike japan, its economy is not exactly anemic, as it is still on the ascending side of the growth curve, rather at the top.

at a trade conference some while back, jacques chirac walked out when french business executives addressed the conference in english, as opposed to french.

 http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main...ixnewstop.html 

that already shows the declining power of french against an established language.

of course it would be premature to say that chinese NOW has a greater immediate influence than french worldwide. people might not need to speak chinese now, but in the future? given where the money is to be had, and expectations of where china will be in the future....i'd say chinese is a surer bet than japanese if it comes to overturning the influence of the french language.  
 
 
 
"The point is to keep the US competitive. Learning Chinese isn't just a way for Americans to get jobs in China, but for them to do business with Chinese companies and compete with Mandarin speakers from other countries.":

 

Think this through. Outside of China, how much of this is really true?
 
 
Mandarin is one of the most difficult languages to learn. Even in Singapore, the gov had to initiate a program to make Mandarin popular with the Chinese here...
 
 
Quite the opposite. China is focusing more on english, since it realises that there is a huge service market out there which it can compete for if it has trained workforce which can speak english.

The French though are trying hard, I guess don't realise that no one is bothered any more about French. Since both UK & US's primary language is english, I don't see a change in trends coming anytime soon.

Add in India, Australia, Canada, New Zealand & some African states like Nigeria, Zimbabwe, SAF, we collectively outnumber any other language.
 
 
col yu,

of course. chinese businesses have yet to fully penetrate the int'l market. exporting, yes, but usually not under their own name. in fact, chinese market penetration by the likes of haier and lenovo et al have barely begun, with the huge focus on supplying the demands of 1.2 billion chinese first.

but any manufacturing infrastructure that can begin to supply the demands of all those people will certainly make a splash overseas. and when that happens, chinese will certainly be helpful if not necessary.
 
 
 
Well, I've used French in my travels a 1000 times more often than I was required to speak the few pick up words of Japanese.

 

True but I have picked up more than 1 japanese tourist in europe by speaking Japanese to her. Same in Florida, when I was a single man.

Gotta look for the opportunities
 

Korean was the most useless languange that I learned. But the Marine Corps sent me to school for that.

It did help me meet my future wife once I came back to the states though.  
 
 
667medic,

i would disagree, speaking-wise, chinese is a good deal easier to learn than english. writing, however, is another matter.  

gautam,

a more globalized world, is all. china, and for that matter taiwan, has always focused quite a bit on english. now, the US and the rest of the world is trying out mandarin for size, having not done so at all previously. for example, the US AP (advanced placement) system in high school is planning to open up 2400 advanced chinese courses throughout the US.

surprise, surprise- after that happens that will be more than all other AP foreign language courses combined. it's a trend...  
 
 
Americans should be learning Spanish, so they can hold their country together, then Chinese, to keep up with Chinese economic expansion-- and then French, because-- well, because American French is so bizarre and so irritating to the French.
And yes, the Chinese expatriate community is huge, still speaks Mandarin or Cantonese, and plays a significant role smooting the way for mainland business (and other) enterprises as they take up global challenges.
 
 
I hope they bring those yummy little oranges when they come...
 
 
 
Americans should be learning Spanish, so they can hold their country together, then Chinese
 

Nope. The Spanish speaking population had better learn English...
 
 
 
Nope. The Spanish speaking population had better learn English...

 

Brainstorm! They can sell those yummy little oranges on the street corner after the Chinese bring them!  
 
 
Would we have to learn to speak Chinese or Spanish?
 
 
Let me offer a rebuttal of this article, because I happen to know a thing or two about this subject. You see, I teach English in China. I can say from first hand experience that the Chinese are actively trying to teach their population to speak ENGLISH. The English language training now begins in grade school here. And trust me, if you are any sort of teacher whos native language is English you can find a job here tomorrow.

And another thing. Hell.. most people here speak Cantonese. They cant even get their entire population to speak Mandarin, how are they gonna influence anyone else to?

Frances' main problem is their insistance on a pure language, constantly trying to weed out 'foreign' words to keep french 'french". English on the other hand is a whore, getting into bed with whatever other language comes along and stealing the best bits for latter use, that's why it survives and prospers.
 
 
 
Would we have to learn to speak Chinese or Spanish?

 

Nah, if the Mexican kid is holding up a bag of oranges and three fingers, give him $3, then go home and enjoy your oranges.

Hey, shouldn't you guys convert to islam so you can hold your country together?

I want to learn Spanish so I can tell my maid what to do.  

And Chinese won't be as big as English unless they can control the internet.

that sounds pretty suspect for a guy who's both worked and lived in china. the article did not question the fact that the chinese have been teaching their population english- as a second language. hell, to use pinyin, you have to know the basics of the alphabet, anyway. even on taiwan, where they use the zhuyin system, english is still taught extensively (although very poorly).

the real suspicious part is your last paragraph. "most people here speak Cantonese", this would be true where? Hong Kong? Guangdong? but in either case, most hongkongnese can speak mandarin and english just fine, while in guangdong most people also known cantonese. there's some 65 million cantonese speakers...and some 865 mandarin speakers. you do the math.

as for influencing anyone else, there's a dam' good reason why all those US high schools are suddenly offering programs in chinese.

with a very low percentage of internet penetration, china's already number two. the US's internet penetration has slowed down dramatically in the past few years, as most people who want the internet already has it. most of the others don't have the internet, not because they are too poor, but because they don't want to.

so...wait 5-10 years, china will start approaching the number of US users in at least absolute terms. we're not even talking about the investments in cable and broadband technology which places like South Korea, Japan, and even China are making, and which the US is not. it is of sufficient concern that a piece on that matter showed up in Foreign Policy magazine a while back.

The only people who keep telling me this are mainland Chinese. Are you one of them...
Seriously man how exactly is Mandarin supposed to be easy to learn when you have the same word having different meaning based on the pronounciation. I agree that even in English there are words like Minute (time) and Minute (size) which are similar words but pronounced differently but its not as common as in Mandarin.
I am fluent in English and Tamil. I know some Hindi. I even found it easier to learn German but I failed at Mandarin.....
 
 
medic,

mandarin's grammar structure is less complex than that of english or german. not only that, there are far, far fewer "exceptions to the rule" which english has a plethora of. the difficulty which you point out of having the same word with different meanings based on pronunciation- well, it's the same way you would differentiate between the two types of "minute"- context.

you know the context of what the person is talking about, and you know the pronunciation of the word, you should know exactly what's happening.

It does not matter how many users China will have. A typical internet user searches and looks for webpages in English. So unless China has many websites offering interesting content, let it be media, technology, research etc non Chinese speakers will not get the urge to read/write Chinese in the web.

And for that you have to beat the current internet powerhouses who almost exclusively publish in English and the big ones who translate them in English. French tried to propogate their language in the internet, and so far they are failing miserably.  
 
 
Thanks to Google's translation tool, even if the content was in Chinese, Google would just translate it into English.

Like what the colonel said, even if the entire Chinese population is online and using the internet in Chinese, how often are you likely to converse with them in Chinese halfway around the world?

Do you think people can communicate with each other without writing? Speaking, maybe, but a huge part of online communication is in writing. People need to learn how to write Chinese first before they can post anything in Chinese. How likely is that to happen?
 
 
gunnut,

it will most certainly get more likely, what with both europeans and americans jumping on the learn-mandarin bandwagon  

as any nation's influence increases, more people will speak the language. we saw this with both english and french during their period of dominance.
 
 
Well, I don't mind learning Mandarin, in fact I had tried to in the past. It would help me communicate better with my Chinese buddies from mainland and Singapore.

Astralis, can you direct me to a source where I might be able to learn Mandarin. Must be free ofcourse  
 
 
Date a Chinese Mandarin speaker... Oh, wait, you said "free."

667medic,

 
Astralis, can you direct me to a source where I might be able to learn Mandarin. Must be free ofcourse
 

well, i can assure you col yu's suggested method will probably be the most entertaining way  

but hey, if you want free, here's a few good suggestions:

-local library for beginning mandarin course readers. get the very basics of chinese down, like the four tones/pinyin system. find out if you want to learn traditional or simplified chinese. heck, you can google this and you'll find something.

after that,

-ChinesePod.  http://www.chinesepod.com/ 

good for listening comprehension.

-  www.zhongwen.com 

excellent reference site, easy to use dictionary. also links to other chinese-learning pages.

and a bit more advanced, but very useful:

-  http://www.oneaday.org 

pick up the idioms and references that native chinese speakers sprinkle into their speech and writing. these are probably the hardest to learn, because they are so varied and many, and are based in the chinese historical/cultural tradition. but if you can use these competently in speech, it'll not only show you that you got chinese down...but that you're probably going native  
 
 
 
Date a Chinese Mandarin speaker... Oh, wait, you said "free."

 

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA...

Excuse me, yes Guangdong, and Hong Kong, guess I should have been more specific with "here" I live in Guangzhou. Although I wouldnt say that "most" people in Hong Kong speak English well enough to hold any sort of complex conversation, at least the vast majority of those that I encountered.

Also, I learned a great deal of Mandarin before my travels here, and contrary to what you say I've encountered many people here in "Guangzhou" that do not understand Mandarin, only Cantonese, and at times my Mandarin knowledge is useless.

Well honestly some of our people should be learning Chinese, but I would hardly say that the Chinese have illusions of the Mandarin language taking over the word, thats just plain, dumb.

I couple photo's here. One from Baiyun Mountain, and one from Guangzhou zoo, I toke during the May holiday here last week.

I'm not a lier sir.
 
 
 
jay, gautam,

Trust me, the reason they bought Baidu is not to loose out Chinese search and admarket revenues. Did you see Baidu as a brand outside China? Or for that matter, since China is the 2nd largest user base for internet can you tell me a Chinese web brand thats popular here in the US??

well, sir, forgive the note of suspicion; simply just that at WAB there have been quite the number of liars whom the mods promptly ban. just checking   if true, then i shall wholeheartedly welcome WAB's own laowai and send in my 'pologies!  

in any case, to address your pt,

no, the chinese do not have illusions of mandarin taking over the world. i don't think that was either mine, nor the article's, meaning. as for guangzhou and hk, i reckon that we are interacting primarily with different sets of people. obviously just about everyone in guangzhou will speak cantonese (i think i poorly worded it above), but i would still say most people understand mandarin. but given china's population, even the minority that do not is still a tremendous number.

Haha, yes lao wai in the house...hehe.. no problem. I was actualy kinda disheartened when I arrived in Guangzhou and incountered my first problem with a street vendor who looked at me as if I had spoken greek to him when I asked him a question in Mandarin.
