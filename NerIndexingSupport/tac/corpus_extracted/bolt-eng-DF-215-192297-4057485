Once again the US Government is controling how much money people can make on the side by imposing TAXES on E-BAY purchases through PAYPAL.You can't have over 200 payments on paypal or the government will get you for taxes,nor can you make over $20,000 in a year.BIG BROTHER is now controling just how much the poor person can make selling USED items on EBAY.EBAY,an online flea-market sort o speak.
This is just another example of how the BIG BROTHER squashes the little guy,yes,you can be a entrapenure,and run a small business from your home,but BIG BROTHER,in all it's patheticness and dowright GREED now wants US,the little guys,to pay for their misgivings and over spending.
I for one have been enjoying selling on EBAY for quite some time,and now,that must come to an end.Why,EBAY won't even let us accept money orders from people,because they want those absorbent FEES from us for PayPal,plus EBAY wants us to pay a "percentage" of what we get for an item,so with all those fees and percentages being taken out,and now,BIG BROTHER wants us to PAY EVEN MORE of our hard earned money,it just isn't worth it anymore to sell on EBAY.
I for one will be seeking other,less obtrusive selling avenues,other than EBAY to sell my items,if not,I just won't sell anything again.
I refuse to be victimized by BIG BROTHER or anyone else.
EBAY and PayPal will be out of business within a year or less,because I feel I am not the only one outraged at this disgusting turn of events!
Comments welcome to me by other sellers at swordsbane@aol.com.
I'd like to hear from you.
 
 
They will tax you or simply give you a 1099MISC income statement as they should.
 
 
If you doing more than $20K it's probably not a hobby selling used stuff out of your garage. That would be a business and subject to take anyway. There's really no change here other than making it harder for people to cheat their taxes.
 
 
take - tax
 
 
not if you make more than $20,000,,, if you do more than $20,000 in sales,,,,,

I'm going to argue that I was bartering with cash as a medium since I'm unemployed and Items I sell are from personal collections.

theres a few other posts about this on other boards,,

I use my paypal card for all postage, supplies and business,,,, I'm using the term loosely,,,,, purchases.

Print paypal balance Jan1,
Print paypal balance Dec 31,,,,

If its more you made money, the rest is unprovable and the IRS has to prove things these days.

The IRS does not have to prove you did not make a profit. You do.

The IRS just has to prove you have income or assets that you could not have on the reported income.

The IRS will tax you on every penny you receive unless you can prove you have a qualified deduction.

The change is not in what is taxable. Most of your ebay sales should be reported somewhere on your return any way.

The only thing that is changing is now the IRS requires ebay and pay pal to report the sales so they can make sure you are reporting what you were suposed to be doing any way.

You can make as much money as you want. In fact, the government wants you to make lots of money. They also want to make sure you are paying the taxes that you legally owe. Those taxes aren't new. I for one have been enjoying selling on EBAY for quite some time,and now,that must come to an end. Why? Because the IRS will find out that you have not been reporting all your income? That seems like throwing out the baby with the bath water. I refuse to be victimized by BIG BROTHER or anyone else. An admirable sentiment but how does that apply here? EBAY and PayPal will be out of business within a year or less,because I feel I am not the only one outraged at this disgusting turn of events! This isn't about eBay at all. It isn't even about PayPal. It is about all payment processors. It is a federal law. eBay and PayPal did not cause. You did. How? By not paying legally owed taxes on the profit you made selling. I already claim all my revenue. Having it reported to the IRS won't change anything.

I don't think it's a matter of the government controlling how much money you make, only you have control over that. You make the money, you owe the taxes. It's pretty simple fact of running a business, here in the U.S. or many other countries.

I claim my income from eBay sales, so nothing new for me either.
 
 
I would argue that we should all be mad about paying taxes WE OWE but..... I like going to the bathroom INDOORS and want that and a few other services/infrastructures my tax dollars go towards keeping up to continue! And I agree with Fairie.....I feel you are just upset cause you will get caught not paying on what you should have been paying for all this time. By the way....I was once in a barter service club...that is taxed as well. Bad argument.

and now,BIG BROTHER wants us to PAY EVEN MORE of our hard earned money Sorry, but income from garage sales, yard sales, and even bartering has been taxable for decades. Do not confuse taxable with enforced. The IRS is smart enough to realize that sending a $50,000 a year agent to collect taxes on a $500 once-a-year garage sale is stupid and not cost effective, so they don't. But that doesn't mean they won't asses income taxes if they have proof of income that is not showing up on your Form 1040. And it's not even the government you should be mad at!! The IRS didn't make the law -- they only enforce the laws that are on the books. The law was created by our elected officials - US Senators and US Representatives, and signed into law by our previous President. But you can't blame Congress and the President... they didn't dream this stuff up... they just bowed to the wishes of their constituents -- the people who voted them into office. Which would be you and/or your neighbors... and the folks down the street... and the next street over... and downtown... and...well...just about everyone. Or at least everyone who takes the time to VOTE. -Bob.

As Pogo Possum said, "We have met the enemy and he is us."
 
 
THE IRS WILL PUT EBAY OUT OF BUSINESS, THEN THE WILL GET NO TAXES, FROM EBAY OR THE SELLERS
 
 
I HOPE EBAY NOTIFIES THE SELLERS WHEN THEY GET TO 199 SELLS AND/or TO $19,995
 
 
eBay will not issue a 1099. Payment processors are the ones subject to the new tax regulation.

the rules on taxation are not changing at all. some of us will simply get a statement of sales that have occurred. the taxes and generous deductions remain.
 
 
ebay will be out of business by june 2011
 
 
ebay will be out of business by june 2011 I've seen similar predictions since I started selling on eBay. Obviously none have come true yet.

George Bush signed this into law July 2008.
 
 
I could be wrong. But, how can the money you make at a garage sale be taxable? If you are selling lets say baby clothes in your garage sale for a loss because they are used. Then you should be able to claim a loss, right?
 
 
If you need tax-related information, it's always a good idea to start w/the IRS, since they are the proverbial "horse's mouth." Anyone who's not sure about where they stand (is it a hobby or a business?) should go to the IRS website page  Online Auction Seller Hobby versus a Business . You'll find a video, fact sheets, etc. Additionally, the IRS site has an  Online Auction Sellers Tax Center  for even more information. Finally, check out the  IRS Small Business and Self-Employed Tax Center .   Sallie

 No matter where you go, there you are. 
 
 
"Faerie", I just love to hear holier-than-thou people like you spout off like you do. I'm sure you do everything right and proper in your mind, you don't do anything wrong at all and never have, right?

The argument here is about whether it's right for ebay/paypal to report our information to big brother, just as the fight going on where they are trying to force amazon and every other online or catalog vendor to do. Government already intrudes in our lives far too much. They tax us when we earn money, they tax us when we spend it, they tax what we own after we've bought it, even when it gets worn out or we don't need it anymore and want to sell it (at a loss) they want to tax it again. If we save the money they tax it, they tax any interest our savings may earn, if we then draw it out and spend it, the tax cycle starts again. The government taxes every dollar multiple times, and then are amazed that the economy is failing! Then add on non-tax taxes, such automobile registration, mandatory inspections, and licensing fees. Situation even worse...

Then, to top it off, they waste it on idiotic pursuits and come back with their hand out again, taking more and more when there's nothing left to give. Robin Hood, where have you gone?

You are such a big supporter of the gov't that you must be one of their "un-fire-able" clones, er I mean employees. That or you're way better off than the great majority of eBay'ers that are trying to make a little extra cash to pay the bills and scrape by any way they can. And yeah, check those bills we have to pay, there's gov't tax in there somewhere too.

Just keep spouting about how good the gov't is to you and remember that when they start installing video cameras in your house to make sure you aren't doing something they think you shouldn't do. Hear that noise? It's the jack-booted thugs marching up to your door...

Apparently there has been a post deleted from this thread, or you have completely missed the point...

Faerie has at no point defended either the government's tax policies or the means in question with which they hope to enforce them. He/She has merely pointed out that this has nothing to do with ebay & PayPal, & surely will not be the end of either. Frankly, from reading posts here & far more so on the Power Seller boards, (where dozens of posters have come forward on threads with hundreds of posts basically saying "now I'm going to have to pay taxes!"), I'd concern myself far more with whatever else the IRS might be doing.

If I were the IRS, I'd have someone reading these world readable ebay forums (or better yet, a bot collecting relevant posts), & building a list of seller IDs to subpoena from ebay.

What is being debated here is a non-event from an ebay/paypal perspective. Sellers publicly ranting about how tee'd off they are that they may have to pay taxes, on the other hand...

(so how about we kill these threads, before the IRS gets really smart   )

I have nothing to fear from the IRS, anything I owe I pay. That doesn't mean I like the way they do business, or the way the government wastes all they take from us. If they want to come after me, they can bring it on.

My point with Faerie is the tone of the posts that tries to paint anyone who doesn't agree with the policy as being dishonest or trying to get away with something. Many of us simply want the government to back off and give us just a little freedom.

When the economy is so bad and people are trying all they can to scrape by, that is clearly NOT the time to start going after things like flea markets, garage sales, and eBay. Oh well, after they stop everybody from making anything, we can all live on welfare and let Big Brother foot the bill.

If you buy something to sell you are running a business.

Up to $20,000 You are running under the radar.

But the year your income does get reported... then the IRS May look back and wonder how you got to that $20,000 level

And do remember...

If Paypal does the reporting... then the cost of shipping is included..

If ebay sales get close to $15,000 to $17,000 then postage could put you over the $20,000 limit.

There are three realities... Birth... Death... and... Taxes.
 
 
I'm confused here. Say I buy something for $19,500 (which I pay taxes on, so the actual sales price is $19,975 for arguments sake). I sell it on Ebay for $20,100 (and then Ebay & PayPal take out their fees so I actually lose money). Because the sale was for over $20,000, the IRS wants me to pay taxes on something that I originally paid taxes on, and that I also lost money on? Forgive me for being stupid, but something smells rotten in Denmark.....
 
 
"Faerie", I just love to hear holier-than-thou people like you spout off like you do. I'm sure you do everything right and proper in your mind, you don't do anything wrong at all and never have, right? How silly. I did learn from my first business mentor that ultimately legal is a more cost effective way to do business. I am usually right but I'd hesitate to ever say that I am proper. I most certainly have done wrong - sometime unintentionally but sometime deliberately. You are such a big supporter of the gov't that you must be one of their "un-fire-able" clones, er I mean employees. That or you're way better off than the great majority of eBay'ers that are trying to make a little extra cash to pay the bills and scrape by any way they can. And yeah, check those bills we have to pay, there's gov't tax in there somewhere too. I believe that government is best which governs least. That said - there are some things that are best left at a federal level. Things like national security and an interstate highway system. Those things need to be paid for. That's not support -- it's pragmatism. I am not an eBayer. I am a business owner that sells on eBay. It leads to a very different perspective. Personally I spend more time buying on eBay and on the discussion boards than I do selling. I don't care if you agree or disagree with it. I actually haven't thought of it in those terms because my agreement or disagreement doesn't matter. It is what it is and when it becomes active law I will deal. tarheeltreasurehunt - to be reported you have to both sell more than $20,000 in revenue and more than 200 transactions. Either condition alone will not qualify for reporting. If after selling you lost money, then you wouldn't pay taxes. In fact, it might lessen your tax liability.

The critical fact about the transaction.

(1) Did you buy it to resell?

(2) Profit is sales price, minus original price, minus costs to sell the item.

If that number is negative... there is no profit and in turn no income tax dues on that transaction..

We are talking about running a business... buying inventory for resale... and if after a series of sales you have a profit...

that is sales plus postage minus.... cost of inventory..... minus fees... minus all other costs to make the sale...

then you have taxable business income...

You can check an IRS form to determine what the allowable business deductions are.

I live in Canada,,, my business deductions include..

eBay fees

Paypal fees.

Purchase of new inventory

Use of the internet

Supplies... paper, tape... and pens... anything you use in your business

Uses of an automobile... (70 % of the annual cost of my automobile is deductible for me).

Use of my apartment (About 50 % of my monthly rent is deductible.)

Also allowed a percentage deduction of the cost of a computer, and printer each year plus other equipment (for me this percentage is 30 % each year)...

Earn $20,000 by working at a salary job... and you pay tax... income is fully taxable

After $20,000 in sales plus shipping cost as reported by Paypal... You may have no taxable income... or very little taxable income..

Things may differ somewhat with the IRS... but the end result is that after allowable business deductions

taxable income is greatly reduced.. Yet you have paid for your vehicle... part of your apartment or residence or 100 % of a storage area...

Small businesses are very much tax advantaged.

Find out what you can deduct to determine taxable income...

I use one of those computer programs to calculate my tax each year... If you have done the same.

Find the forms and do a rough calculation for last year...

Not all of that $20,000 reported by Paypal will be taxable

Find out what deduction the IRS allows and go from there...
 
 
Small businesses are the backbone of the US and Canada as well as other countries... Just look around you.

There are big businesses... They are obvious.

Look carefully to see all of the small businesses

As sellers on eBay we are those "small businesses"

and you may find out how little tax you owe.

or in turn

how little profit you actually make...

or in turn......

how well off you are after all of the allowable deductions.

After deductions I have a new car... a new computer... a comfortable apartment...

and the money the government would have received in the form of income tax... That money I use to buy inventory...

The tax man is coming...

The most important thing anyone can do now is do the calculations and find out what your actual situation is

Forgive me for being stupid, but something smells rotten in Denmark.....  
 

The IRS wants you to pay the taxes you owe. And if you do not owe any they what to know why.

If you purchased the item to resale you would be able to claim a loss on the item. If it was a personal item you may still be able to claim the deductions up to the income but not the loss.

Reportable income $20,000
Basis (what it cost) $19.975
------------------------

Profit $25

deduct your fees $1000

-----------------------------------------------

total loss $975

Now you show a loss of $975 on the sale of the item. No taxes paid and it can offset other taxable income and can reduce the tax you would have paid on it.

This is really nothing new the IRS is just now forcing Ebay and Pay Pal to report the income to them so that the IRS knows who is being honest and who is cheating on their tax returns.

I guess that most people on here are honest and are doing what they are supposed to do and will see no real change except maybe getting the 1099. No big deal they are reporting it anyway.

It is the smaller percentage of people that are dishonest and are not reporting the income from sales that will see the biggest change.

I have read that one of the reasons for the law change is that Pay pal and other like online banking services have been used to transfer money to terrorists and drug trafficking. The ideal of this new law is to track and stop those type of transactions. One key way to catch those type of criminals is tax evasion. Al Capon only served time for Tax Evasion not any criminal activity. The law could not prove he was guilty of any crimes but they could prove he was not reporting all the income he had on his tax return.
 
 
This is why I took the time to become a legit biz in 2010. I got an accountant and learned my bookkeeping software. I have an apptmt for my acct to do my b&0 taxes. I'll write a check to my state and to my city and learn how to remit the small amount of sales taxes that I collected. Then I'll have my accountant do my fed taxes. I am not an expert and admit that I am a new biz owner and an extremem newbie to all of this legal stuff. That is why I have my accountant to help me. What I will pay them is essential!! Everyone who is not an expert in these matters should have one. I can run the biz but have a hard time becoming an expert of everything.............like most entrepreneurs.

It is important to know the many aspects of the accountant's activities.

If only to make sure the accountant does it right.

Because if anything goes wrong... you.. and NOT the accountant... are in trouble.

Always ask yourself...Was it done correctly?... and if you are not sure... or the accountant is hesitant... Take care....
 
 
When the economy is so bad and people are trying all they can to scrape by, that is clearly NOT the time to start going after things like flea markets, garage sales, and eBay. Most of these new reporting laws were kicked around in Congress long before the current recession. Things like this don't happen overnight -- and they don't get enacted and 'turned on' the next day. I guess Congress -- the people WE voted into office to look out for OUR interests -- just decided it was time to make sure everyone on eBay was paying by the same rules. -Bob.

How about items we got last year 2010 and being sold this year 2011? Are they counted as the COST too?
 
 
How about items we got last year 2010 and being sold this year 2011? The actual answer is: "it depends". Ask your accountant for the full story - here's the short one... Accounting is either done on an "accrual" basis or on a "cash" basis. Most micro businesses (like eBay sellers) work on a "cash" basis -- you account for your expenses when you pay them, you account for your income when you receive it. So in your example, the expense would be accounted for against 2010 income, and the payment would be part of your 2011 income. -Bob.

HOW MANY PEOPLE MAKE THAT MUCH ON EBAY??????

I SELL ON EBAY FOR 6 YEARS AND NEVER MADE CLOSE TO THAT MUCH

PAWN SHOP sell on ebay for years big money

example

I know of one pawn shop in houston that sell over 1000 dollar a day and a few year ago they were making over 3 to 4 thousand a day

THE FAST MONEY ON EBAY IS LONG GONE

IRS is nothing compare to the ebay fees that keep going up in the last 6 years, this year we pay for the item and postage and paypal fees.
 
 
Dayumm. I remain committed to only making $19,999.99 in eBay sales this year!
 
 
Hell with selling on ebay or paying taxes....I'm trying to figuire how I can make myself a "financial institution" and qualify for federal "stimulist money"....like the guys on Wall Street....that's thr real gig to have!!!!
 
 
My other thought is to sit down and a book about fiction based upon true life experiences that involved the following...

an $18 mil bank heist

political corruption and cover up all the way to a top ranking washing politician

and Institution that is ranked as one of the most powerful in all the world and is located in Italy....

It involves all the elements that make a great novel...sex, drugs, lies greed and political power...

Unfortunately it's so true, nobody would believe it....

Dang!!!!
 
 
Silly me, here I have been paying all the taxes I owe on my Ebay BUSINESS income.......
 
 
Those that are not paying their taxes look on the bright side.

Being a tax cheat is a requirement if you are looking for a presidential cabinet position.
 
 
But, if you sell 200 items over the course of year for.99 cents that ain't right.
 
 
Selling 200 99cent items won't trigger it. The rule is 200 or more transactions AND $20,000 or more in total transaction value. You must cross both thresholds in order to get reported - this year. As with most things governmental, once they get a taste of how many non-reporters they find, you can expect those thresholds to come down. It's just like the excessive shipping sellers -- a few bad apples get the whole barrel thought of as cheats, so the broad swipe of governmental edict is used to "fix everything". -Bob.

Why am I paying taxes twice? i've already purchased the items
and paid 10% tax here in lovely Illinois - then, I must pay taxes
AGAIN after it is sold?.......UH,.........?????????? criminal.
 
 
Why are you paying tax on items you are going to resell?

And yes, all of us pay taxes on the income we earn.

The 10% is your state and local SALES tax, do you charge tax for items you sell within the state? As an eBay seller you should get a tax ID # which means that you are a legal business, do not pay sales tax when you purchase, collect and pay taxes on all sales within your state. The Fed INCOME tax or state INCOME tax is completely different from the 10% state SALES tax you are paying.

I spent today doing inventory and giving my accountant a headache..he loves me during the holidays   I make sure that I am totally finished with all my taxes by January 5th so I can adjust as needed as early in the year as possible to take advantage of every tax advantage that there i.

And yes, all of us pay taxes on the income we earn.

I dont consider The IRS the "Big Brother", I consider them the "Big Dummy". But anyways, 20,000 a year is not just bubblegum money, That probably equivelent to someone making 9 bucks an hr at a full 40 hr work week for a year. Plus, people should want to claim and pay into it to build their retirement amount, and other government benefits. The benefit amounts are based on your income. Disablity, Retirement, Unemployment, Ect. ect. If you dont claim it, you may be robbing yourself in the long run!
 
 
Hello,
Last year was my first year selling with Ebay and I am trying to figure out what I will need for my 2011 Ebay/PayPal taxes. Does anyone know of a good tax person that specializes in Ebay home businesses in San Deigo or Los Angeles? Thank you in advance for any information.

how do i go about getting a tax id number? do i have to pay for it? and can i pay my taxes monthly and get a tax return like a regular job, or do i have to wait till the end of the year and pay?
 
 
If you are a sole proprietor then your SSN is your tax ID.

You should either talk to an accountant or do some research to learn about your options. The IRS website has good information and most state revenue websites also have good info.

I been selling on ebay for around 5 yrs or so and its alot harder then some people think. What i dont understand is how someone can sell an item for less then what I can get it for!!!! What the heck??? I removed alot of my items from flebay recently because this is getting out of hand, fee's on top of fee's they never stop. And now another hand wants in the cookie jar of my hard earned money!!! What a joke! I think after this happens alot of people will realize just how much money they are LOOSING!!
 
 
It will be PayPal who will send you an email. I received my email today and my 1099 is on the way! And I think this is wrong. Tax was already paid on initial purchase This is double-dipping!
 
 
You pay sales tax on purchases. You pay income tax on income.

Does anyone know if the $20,000 that can be made before you have to file taxes is total earned income after all the fees? For instance, I sold $23,000 in 2011, but all my fees equaled $12,000. Since I'm only profiting $11,000, do I still need to file on that since my total sales were over $20,000? Hope this makes sense.
 
 
At the end of this month,(JAN), PayPal will send you and the IRS a copy of your Form 1099-K for the 2011 tax year in accordance with Internal Revenue Code Section 6050W. Under the new rule, PayPal is required to report the total payment volume received by any payee that:
· Received more than $20,000 in gross payment volume from sales of goods or services in 2011, AND · Received more than 200 separate payments in 2011. If you receive a 2011 Form 1099-K, this means your PayPal account exceeded both thresholds during the 2011 tax year.
 
 
I didn't come close to either threshold so this doesn't really apply to me however...

Reporting gross receipts on a 1099 to the IRS is just wrong. 1099's are for income. Gross receipts via ebay or Paypal are not necessarily income. In no other area of business is someone required to submit a 1099 for something sold - even if it's $1M.

If you inherited a house full of contents and sold it on ebay and it exceeded the $20K/200 pcs limit, you would have to explain to the IRS why you actually had no business and no income.

If you sold stuff for friends and exceeded the limts, you'd also have to explain yourself.

I'm surprised that more people aren't up in arms about this. It is an invasion of privacy (Paypal and ebay are forced to share the numbers).

No one should have to answer for their transactions. Businesses claim their income on Schedule E's or on separate returns.

Contact your Congressman.

Yes. You are supposed to report your profit and pay taxes on it no matter how little it was. The $20K threshold is not about what YOU have to pay taxes on, it's specifically about what PayPal has to send out a 1099-K for.
 
 
Reporting gross receipts on a 1099 to the IRS is just wrong. 1099's are for income.

1099's serve a variety of purposes but all are about money received.

It isn't just a PayPal thing. It affects any payment processor. So now instead of listing my gross sales revenue on my taxes I have to break it out into sales revenue from payment processors where I received a 1099 and sales revenue from other sources. What hasn't changed is that I report my gross revenue.

In my family we have a phrase for this type of complaint: first world problem.

Think about it.

bs.has nothing to do with terrorists getting money via online sales etc....the change in the law is because of lobying of the simon group and other MALL owners who feel that online sellers are getting an unfair advantange by not paying sales taxes on purchases.
 
 
Anyone can help me filling this ebay tax"whatever"..

Got my 1099 by mail a week ago,and never thought i made that $20,***...Just today i got my paypal reports.So i have all figures including..

**Money I spend for buying items to sell..
**Ebay fees
**Paypal Fees

About mid of year 2011 my laptop need to be replace and i bought a new one and used this laptop all my ebay transaction, but i did use to my personal use.Does this count as one of the write off?
I have lots of question with regards to this.What form to use.This is my first time to do taxes and i dont have any idea. I dont wanna go to tax office and pay for this..unless no choice at all..Any help is much appreciated.
 
 
I guess I'm a little surprised at how many people are bothered by getting the 1099 from PayPal. I got mine this week and was actually proud of myself because my figures that I was going to give to my accountant for Gross Sales was only $80 off what PayPal said I had made. Just showed I had kept track pretty well with my sales figures.

I don't look at it as any invasion of my privacy. I was going to report the amount anyway. I'm not paying tax on anything twice as I have a sales tax number and don't pay sales tax on my resale goods anyway. And I understand that the amount on my 1099 is not what I actually made in profit but is my gross sales that my expenses will be subtracted from. Which after I subtract all of my overhead and expenses it is rather depressing to see what little profit is left. But, it is what it is.

Hi! I used to sell items at a local antique mall that were & have been recently purchased at local garage sales. I have no receipts to show what I actually paid. My basement is full of stuff I now sell on ebay. I did sell enough last year to receive the 1099. How do I put a dollar value on the garage sale item I sold? Where do I begin? Thank you for any info.
 
 
Hi, I am not bothered either. My concern is proof of what I paid for my garage sale items. I have none and I have a basement full of such items from the past 10 years or so. I used to sell at a local antique mall. Do you have any input you could share? Any is appreciated. Thank you

It just occured to me that this was about my comment of it being a first world problem, The comment wasn't about terrorism. Duh.

Think about it. Really, think about it. I don't have to worry about having clean, safe drinking water. I never worried that my children would die of cholera or dysentary or malaria. I never worried that my daughters would be physically mutilated to make them acceptable to a husband. I don't worry that my husband might get gunned down by a rival political faction because of his political views. I can sit at my computer or on my phone or in a restaurant and freely criticize my government without fear of arrest.

Stressing about a 1099 is a first world luxury.

I sell a lot of things for friends on Ebay that are too dumb to utilize the system. How would the IRS look at that?
 
 
My goal is to pay $1 Million in taxes, that certainly isn't going to happen buying/selling on eBay. It's truely amazing how many people don't understand taxes......or, maybe it isn't.
 
 
Once again the US Government is controling how much money people can make on the side by imposing TAXES on E-BAY purchases through PAYPAL.You can't have over 200 payments on paypal or the government will get you for taxes,nor can you make over $20,000 in a year.BIG BROTHER is now controling just how much the poor person can make selling USED items on EBAY.EBAY,an online flea-market sort o speak.
This is just another example of how the BIG BROTHER squashes the little guy,yes,you can be a entrapenure,and run a small business from your home,but BIG BROTHER,in all it's patheticness and dowright GREED now wants US,the little guys,to pay for their misgivings and over spending.
I for one have been enjoying selling on EBAY for quite some time,and now,that must come to an end.Why,EBAY won't even let us accept money orders from people,because they want those absorbent FEES from us for PayPal,plus EBAY wants us to pay a "percentage" of what we get for an item,so with all those fees and percentages being taken out,and now,BIG BROTHER wants us to PAY EVEN MORE of our hard earned money,it just isn't worth it anymore to sell on EBAY.
I for one will be seeking other,less obtrusive selling avenues,other than EBAY to sell my items,if not,I just won't sell anything again.
I refuse to be victimized by BIG BROTHER or anyone else.
EBAY and PayPal will be out of business within a year or less,because I feel I am not the only one outraged at this disgusting turn of events!
Comments welcome to me by other sellers at swordsbane@aol.com.
I'd like to hear from you.
 
 
Reading this board and other boards about the 1099 I cant believe this many people were not claiming there Ebay income. Makes us feel dumbe for claiming everything we made through ebay for the last 10 years. People complain about our country not having money but no one wants to do there part. Its not big brother it called being AMERICAN. We pay taxes on our money Why shouldnt You.
