Russia on Wednesday asked for more time to probe the murder of investigative
journalist Anna Politkovskaya, amid few signs of tangible progress in the search
for her killer four years on.

The chief investigator's office said in a statement one day before the
anniversary of the journalist's slaying that it planned to extend the long-
running investigation until February.

Politkovskaya, who was sharply critical of Russia's strongman Vladimir Putin and
his policies in Chechnya, was gunned down in the stairwell of her central Moscow
apartment on October 7, 2006, in an apparent contract killing.

No one has yet been brought to justice for the crime, and the authorities have
failed to identify the mastermind behind the murder.

Russian rights activists said on Wednesday that the lack of progress in the
probe simply confirmed fears that such murders could be committed with impunity
in Russia.

Investigators said they were hunting for people "who could be involved in the
murder" and had requested legal help of "several European countries."

Two Chechen brothers, Dzhabrail and Ibragim Makhmudov, and former police officer
Sergei Khadzhikurbanov are suspected of being accessory to the crime.

All three were acquitted on lack of evidence in a jury trial, though the verdict
was overturned. Shortly after the case was reopened last August, the Supreme
Court sent it back to the prosecutors for further investigation.

Khadzhikurbanov, who was sentenced to eight years in a prison camp for extorting
money from a witness, has been transferred to Moscow for questioning, the state
Rossiiskaya Gazeta daily reported Wednesday, citing a source in the chief
investigator's office.

A third brother, Rustam Makhmudov, was the suspected hitman and is on the run.

"The probe is very slow, ineffective. They've only now begun looking for the
trigger man Makhmudov -- why not earlier?" Tatiana Lokshina of Human Rights
Watch told AFP.

"We are talking about an abhorrent trend: people who write about dangerous
things, things distasteful to the authorities, are killed, and the impunity of
their killers inspires other criminals to commit new murders," she said.

The 2006 slaying of the Novaya Gazeta journalist, who wrote a critical book
called "Putin's Russia", shocked the world because she was well known, but the
killing was not the first and not the last, Lokshina mourned.

"It was a monstrous shock. It seemed that her worldwide renown would protect
her, but it didn't protect her, and everyone felt how vulnerable she was," she
said.

"Nothing has changed, 2009 was a nightmare without precedent for rights
activists."

The lack of security for Russian activists was again underlined last year when
Politkovskaya's friend and prominent rights activist Natalya Estemirova was shot
dead after being abducted in Chechnya.

Veteran rights campaigner Lyudmila Alexeyeva, 83, grimly said that the probe
could be going nowhere because of the involvement of the Russian federal
security service (FSB).

"The FSB carried out surveillance either for the killers or to kill her,"
Alexeyeva, head of the Moscow Helsinki Group, told AFP. "It is because the FSB
is involved that the investigation is stalling.

"It's obvious to me that the FSB's involvement in this case has made it
impossible to sort out."

Politkovskaya's supporters will hold an annual rally in her memory on the fourth
anniversary of her death on Thursday at 4:03 pm (12:03 GMT) at the Chistiye
Prudy park in central Moscow.
