Not according to mohammed and the history of mohammed in "inspired scriptures" of the sunnah.

Lets investigate....

Sahih Bukhari 82.817
...Allah sent Muhammad with the Truth and revealed the Holy Book to him, and among what Allah revealed, was the Verse of the Rajam (the stoning of married person (male & female) who commits illegal sexual intercourse, and we did recite this Verse and understood and memorized it. Allah's Apostle did carry out the punishment of stoning and so did we after him.
I am afraid that after a long time has passed, somebody will say, 'By Allah, we do not find the Verse of the Rajam in Allah's Book,' and thus they will go astray by leaving an obligation which Allah has revealed. And the punishment of the Rajam is to be inflicted to any married person (male & female), who commits illegal sexual intercourse, if the required evidence is available or there is conception or confession. And then we used to recite among the Verses in Allah's Book: "O people! Do not claim to be the offspring of other than your fathers, as it is disbelief (unthankfulness) on your part that you claim to be the offspring of other than your real father."

So there is a missing sura/book, why is that, how can this be...Surely mohammed who is perfect didnt mess up ddi he??? What the heck caused a missing verse??? Lets find out....

Ibn Mardawayh reported that Hudhayfah said:
Umar said to me 'How many verses are contained in the chapter of al-Ahzab?' I said, '72 or 73 verses.' He said it was almost as long as the chapter of the Cow, which contains 287 verses, and in it there was the verse of stoning.[4]

Ayesha:
"When the verses “Rajm” [Stoning] and ayah “Rezah Kabir” descended, they were written on a piece of paper and kept under my pillow. Following the demise of Prophet Muhammad (S) a goat ate the piece of paper while we were mourning."

Another translation goes:
The verse of stoning and of suckling an adult ten times were revealed, and they were (written) on a paper and kept under my bed. When the Messenger of Allah (SAWW.) expired and we were preoccupied with his death, a goat entered and ate away the paper.[5]

AHHHHHHHHH so a goat ate the verses, oh well stuff like that happens.

But what about the rest of the quran, can we trust chinese whispers??? Surely mohammed memorised the quran perfectly???Lets see what mohammed said about his memeory...

Sahih Bukhari Volume 6, Book 61, Number 558: Narrated Aisha: Allah's Apostle heard a man reciting the Qur'an at night, and said, "May Allah bestow His Mercy on him, as he has reminded me of such-and-such Verses of such-and-such Suras, which I was caused to forget."

Sahih Bukhari Volume 6, Book 61, Number 552: Narrated Abu Musa: The Prophet said, "Keep on reciting the Qur'an, for, by Him in Whose Hand my life is, Quran runs away (is forgotten) faster than camels that are released from their tying ropes."

Sahih Bukhari Volume 6, Book 61, Number 558: Narrated Aisha: Allah's Apostle heard a man reciting the Qur'an at night, and said, "May Allah bestow His Mercy on him, as he has reminded me of such-and-such Verses of such-and-such Suras, which I was caused to forget

Sahih Bukhari Volume 6, Book 61, Number 559: Narrated Abdullah: The Prophet said, "Why does anyone of the people say, 'I have forgotten such-and-such Verses (of the Qur'an)?' He, in fact, is caused (by Allah) to forget."

So to conclude from islamic scriptures, not only did mohammed have a very dodgy memory according to him. A goat ate a alrge portion of the quran...

Are muslims reading the correct quran???

Please enlighten me fellow muslims...

Thats very thoughtful but that really has nothing to do with whether muslims are reading the "correct quran". Verses seem to be missing, allah sent down verses only to be abrogated, goats eating verses. This surely begs the question to muslims, what the hell are they reciting mohammed memory and goats have altered the scriptures....

O God get a life please...I am sick to death of people demoralising my religion. If you don't like what we do, how we worship, then fine, don't like it-nobody wants you to. Just like many other things in life we need to learn how to deal with things. What business is it of yours if we are reading the right quraan or not? What is your source, where did you get your information from?

From your scriptures mate thats where. Its your prophet that said this not me...

Im not having a go, i just want you to make sure that you are reading the correct quran thats all. Judging by the sunnah, which is the ONLY historical info on the messenger, it appears that you are reading the incorrect quran.

Good luck i hope you find the correct quran to read

^^Thats exactly the sort of reaction he wants. He's a troll, and the best way to deal with one is with witty comments and rampant sarcasm. Eventually he'll get bored, confused and quite possibly a bit lonely and drudge off to find someone else to harrass  
 
 
Or just believe in the One God, pray to him everyday, keep your relationship tight n ish, and follow your heart instead of a book..

But that's just my cheesy 2 pence/cents.
 
 
Just neg rep him, and writing witty comments is always good  . He is clearly very sad and has some odd agenda. Don't take anything he says too seriously, it's not his fault he's a moron.
 
 
I blame the parents

Like you care...

Thanks Ahmato i'll bare that in mind  
 
 
All i have seen is nasty biting comments towards me and no one actually dare tackling the issue that mohammd himseld admitted he had a shoddy memeory at best and a goat ate a large protion of the quran...

I suppose this links in with muslims not being allowed to befriend a jew or christian as commanded by allah on sura 5.51

Oh well...

Yep, Oh well.

SO
What did everyone have for tea today?  
 
 
Sausages and potatoes, wasn't too interesting - but! I had Reggie Reggie Sauce, and that makes everything interesting/delicious. Although I call 'tea' supper, interesting... What did you have Ahamto? And good lad with the Arsenal supporting, not too bad a result for us on Saturday, I was satisfied with the draw.
 
 
I had a very nice Shepard's Pie, with an odd assortment of vegetables.

The Arsenal where very good, I didn't even realise that second goal had gone in, until Fabregas started shouting at Ferdinand. I've been waiting for a season ticket for ages, have you seen the waiting list?

PS.This has to go down as one of THE best thread hi-jacks of all time.
 
 
For me...beans on toast...mmmm

He's not a troll, he's a fanboy. Read his post history. Every single post he's made so far has been about how his god can beat up all the other gods even if all the other gods join forces and do the fusion dance and charge to their maximum power levels.
 
 
theres only one GOD and I doubt GOD will beat himself up
 
 
I didn't realise the goal had gone in either, until the players were celebrating   I didn't have a clue how we'd scored till they showed the replay (that didn't stop us from celebrating though). I couldn't afford a season ticket, but I have friends who do, and sometimes when they can't go I can use their ticket   Wouldn't it be a bit of a trek from Birmingham to London every weekend ?

Personally, it was the pricelist of the season tikit tht put me off (that and the 300 mile distance between me and emirates)

Wait, surely not at their maximum levels? This is Unheard of!

Mate, for The Arsenal, anything. I would walk 1000 miles, and all that.

Sadly, I will have to leave this thread for now, as I think Sleep > Trolls atm.

The rest of you, enjoy, I'll be back to check up on this in the morning  
 
 
Ever heard of Bart Ehrman, OP?
 
 
OP you arnt making enough effort to know about islam. Go to a mosque during this week, Friday would be better as you will meet more muslims, theerfore, get more ideas and also meet the Imam. Dont try to analyse the Quran on your own since, you dnt know the foundation/principles (may be u do) of islam and an imam can answer your any question at the same time analysing the quran.

So to conclude from islamic scriptures, not only did mohammed have a very dodgy memory according to him. A goat ate a alrge portion of the quran...

Are muslims reading the correct quran???

Please enlighten me fellow muslims...

 

1) The verse regarding stoning to death was abrogated in the presence of Muhammad (pbuh) and it was by Allah's revelation to Muhammad (pbuh) that it should be abrogated. This link talks about it:  http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/S...=1119503545902 

2) The prophet (pbuh) is the teacher and the one that Muslims should take as their guide. If he (pbuh) said that he does not forget anything then that would break his role as a guide because people normally forget and so they cannot follow someone who does not have this same feature as humans. In that hadith regarding Muhammad (pbuh) forgetting it does not mean that therefore there are gaps in the qur'an, no. There is a wisdom behind it (as stated above) and also to remind the Muslim that he should review whatever he forgets from the Qur'an.

Regarding the other part about the goats eating the paper can you please source that? Because it seems false and I have never heard of it before.
 
 
To the OP--
I'm a bit concerned for you. I've seen three or four posts like this one, and it seems to me that you've got this hang up about Islam. Now, I agree with you in the general sense that, as a Christian myself, I naturally believe in the God of Christianity and not the God of Islam. But I'm wondering, why are you so adamant about bashing Islam? It is a religious tradition with a rich history, not unlike our own, and millions (billions? maybe?) of devoted followers to whose lives it gives meaning and comfort. I don't understand why you feel the need to come onto here and pose these "questions" (that are really very, very thinly veiled attacks) about very surface-level inconsistencies in the Quran and other holy texts (that are not any worse than some of the inconsistencies in the Bible, by the way). Both Muslims and non-Muslims on here have sufficiently answered your objections, and yet you don't listen to them. Why are you so opposed to understanding their religion for what it truly is, and not how you (incorrectly, it seems) perceive it? How can we Christians expect people to truly try to understand our own faith if we don't make that same effort ourselves? (answer: we can't, really.) Proving Islam wrong, which seems to be your intent here, does nothing to prove Christianity right, so I'm not sure why you are so insistent. Does your faith really hinge on singling out and "disproving" Islam? To me, it seems more relevant to try to convince others that Christianity is right than that Islam is wrong. I don't mean to be rude or presumptive--and if I am you can tell me off--but I just don't see any benefit in the way you're trying to engage Muslims here in discussion.

Now that I've got that off my chest, I'll just go back into my normal hidey-hole of lurking...  
 
 
I briefly wished to second ~ Shannon ~ 's comments, although not at all wishing to appear pretentious.

Additionally, philos33, if you feel you must even begin to broach such topics, it would be greatly appreciated if an attempt was made at an improvement in spelling, grammar and the like.
 
 
listen yeh youre asking for it
there is only one Holy quran and this quran can still be read and fllowed today in this day and age
also ure merily quoting from the holy quran but you need a better understanding from it
try testing Dr zAKIR nAIK JUST LIKE david campbell and all his queries were answered and after that he didnt say a word
this is a peice of advice for you read the explanations for the transalations at the bottom of the holy quran
maybe you didnt get many relevant answers because all the muslims are sik and tired of you firing questions at islam when you are stone hearted and have lak of knwledge concerning these matters
one minute youre like you want to revert the next minute youre enquiring i dont understand!!!
 
 
If you're so proud and sure that we are reading the incorrect quran then why don't you go to the Muslim Council of Britain, and make your well thought out point to them. Or if you're too scared, make a speech in your local mosque on friday. Stop wasting time on forums and let the whole world know that you think muslims are reading the incorrect quran.
 
 
Guys he's been banned. Forget it.
 
 
What do muslims feel about the Yemeni Fragments?
 
 
To the OP, whatever religion you are, id suggest you worry about what your reading first before worrying about what other people are reading. Its obvious this thread was started to cause a heated stir on simply false imformation but the OP couldnt even manage to get one response.
 
 
Quran is Allah's book, sent through Allah's Messenger Prophet Muhammed (P.B.U.H). How could you challenge the Qu'ran's integrity? You must be bored.

Presenting a challenge like the OP has doesn't take an awful lot of brain-power... you're over-estimating his capacity.

I do enjoy reading challenges to religious books, mind; I just prefer it when it's done well.
