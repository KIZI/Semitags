My coworker would get along swimmingly with kgettingmarried. Or maybe she is kgettingmarried...

Coworker is on the phone with a vendor. CW is from Arizona and went to University of Arizona. Vendor must have asked CW about what school she went to, because CW said, "Well, they're both pretty big schools. U of A is a better school because, you know, it's a university and ASU is a state school, soooo... yeah."
(Back story for those who missed the ML post: kgettingmarried adamantly believes that "universities" are superior to state schools. OP:  http://community.thenest.com/cs/ks/forums/thread/62438842.aspx .)
 
 
Hooooly crap. Then she moved on to talking about how Arizona's gotten really dangerous with "gangs and violence and stuff." Fine. But she just said this, verbatim:

“I don’t know if you heard on the news but, like, last year a lady—some politician or something?—was, like, making an announcement or something and some guy just ran up and shot her....Oh yeah, you heard about that?"
 
 
 
Ha! Does CW know that ASU stands for "Arizona State University ?
FTR, the University of Arizona is superior, but it has nothing to do with university vs. state school.
ETA: Holy shiit, your CW is from Arizona and apparently just now heard about Gabby Giffords?
 
 
I went to a state school for one semester. It was called Central Connecticut state University. How is that not a university?
 
 
 
Ha! Does CW know that ASU stands for "Arizona State University ?
FTR, the University of Arizona is superior, but it has nothing to do with university vs. state school.

 

Oh, no doubt in my mind U of A has a better scholastic reputation overall, but yeah, her reasoning is a little faulty.
 
 
Louisiana State University
Florida State University
Arizona State University
Oklahoma State University
I could keep going.
 
 
 
“I don’t know if you heard on the news but, like, last year a lady—some politician or something?—was, like, making an announcement or something and some guy just ran up and shot her....Oh yeah, you heard about that?"
 

 

  is right. I'm pretty sure everyone heard about that. And part of the reason it was such a big deal was that something like that is sooooooo uncommon as to be incredibly note-worthy. And the guy who shot her wasn't even in a gang!
Okay, sorry, I know everyone else already knows this but ignorance like this bugs the crap out of me.
 
 
She's not exactly proving her argument about UA being the "better" school.

She had to know before. Had to.
Or, I hope. I could have sworn it came up in conversation last year when it happened. But she's very self-involved and has no interest in politics or most major world events.
 
 
The real test of whether she is k, ask her about coupons.

LOL

For the sake of the company I'd probably walk over, hang up her call, tell her to call the vendor back and blame technical difficulties AFTER I'd made her realize what an idiot she is.

In case you don't want to wade through the whole crazy-long thread, here's what kgettingmarried had to say about college options:

"The idea being, you want to go to a university vs a community college. Universities are ranked higher than state schools which are ranked higher than community colleges."
And I don't think she ever did explain her thinking.
 
 
 
“I don’t know if you heard on thenews but, like, last year a lady—some politician or something?—was, like, making an announcement orsomething and some guy just ran up and shot her....Oh yeah, you heard about that?"
 

 

No! My mind = blown.

I assume by "universities" she meant private universities, like Harvard or something, but that still doesn't make much sense. That would put Bob Jones University higher than the University of Iowa.
I wonder where private colleges fit into her rankings.
 
 
 
 
 

So much for her Universities produce smarter people argument.

She's very... special. Our work requires us to request certain documents issued by government agencies in order to clear goods into foreign countries. There are seven different approval numbers for the places in which the goods are produced, and it's vital that those numbers are correct on the documents. Recently, some cargo got held up by customs at the destination because the approval number listed on one of her documents was incorrect.
Our QA team ended up involved to smooth things over with the importing country's authorities. When trying to understand the sequence of events, our QA manager asked CW what was wrong with the certificate she'd issued. Her response: "Oh... yeah, I guess some number was wrong or something."
I'm friends with the QA team members, and the running joke whenever a problem comes up now is, "I guess there's something wrong with some number..."

I would love to believe that was her thinking, but here's kgm's first comment in that thread:
"I'm in MN and went to the University of MN which is a public university. If I had gone to a state school, like St Cloud State or something, the tuition would have been a little less and $863 a month would be about right for tuition + fees."
So her definitions aren't reliant on whether the school is public or private, just whether it's "University of..." or "X State" (she just conveniently ignores the word "university" in the names of state schools   ).
 
 
I have a related question. Are there any states in which the "(state name) State University" is ranked higher academically than the "University of (state name)"? For example, Michigan is ranked higher than Michigan State. Florida is ranked higher than Florida State. Texas is ranked higher than Texas State.

A co-worker and I had this conversation a while back and we couldn't think of any. I'm talking about overall academic reputation, and not just a specific major or program.

Ohio State is ranked higher than Ohio University.
Also, some states are weird. There is no University of New Jersey, New York's system is "State University of New York" so sort of a hybrid of the two nomenclatures, and Penn State is the best state school in PA.
 
 
I miss kgettingmarried.
She kept things lively.

H is from Idaho, and he has always said Idaho State is a better school overall than University of Idaho. Purely anecdotal, and I'm having difficulty finding rankings comparing the two.

In any case, it's still Idaho, so...
 
 
Oh good. So now my feelings of superiority re: Iowa State are justified. Sah-weet!  
Just kidding. Your CW...well...you already knew she was an idiot.
 
 
 
I miss kgettingmarried.
She kept things lively.

 

Yes. And I think she was real. She replied to some of my threads about IT and seemed to actually know about the field, etc.
No offense to bliss but k's brand of drama was much more enjoyable to me.
 
 
Well, I went to the University of Arizona and lived in AZ pretty much my whole life until I graduated college. I view ASU and the U of A in the same vein. Both are good schools, both have the same entrance requirements (at least they did back in 1996 when I was starting college).

Exactly. Which is not called "University of New Jersey." It is called Rutgers.
My point was that it is going to be hard to compare University of New Jersey to New Jersey State University. Not that NJ doesn't have state universities.

Penn State is not a "state school" in PA. There are 14 state schools in PA - Penn State is not one of them. Although, they receive 30% of their funding from the state so they are also in an uproar about Corbett's new plan.....but that's for another thread

Best public school? I think there's a distinction being made here that isn't relevant to this discussion.
Point was -- you can have a discussion about whether University of Pennsylvania is better than Penn State, but that isn't a discussion of which public university is better because University of Pennsylvania is private. If you want to compare the various public universities and colleges in PA, Penn State wins even though it has the "state" name in it (which according to OP's coworker and kgettingmarried, should mean it is inferior to the other schools).
 
 
K probably thinks University of Chicago is a community college.
 
 
But how does she feel about University of Phoenix?

To really make things interesting...the full official name is Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey. So I guess they've covered all the bases.
 
 
that is TOTALLY stupid. There are lots of good schools out there with State in their names and University.

What about the ones with both?
I went to Virginia Tech and the schools full name is Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State Univerisity.
I got a great education and have a great degree and a great job.
ugh....
 
 
Yep, how about Cal State University, like all of the CSU's  
 
 
 
I went to a state school for one semester. It was called Central Connecticut state University. How is that not a university?
 

Ha really? I went to Eastern Connecticut State University.

Wait, does this mean that University of Phoenix outranks Michigan State?
 
 
This is obviously because she is a sadly misguided mildcat*. ~Signed a SunDevil twice over (undergrad and grad school)
Actually it really depends on the program. UofA has the medical school. ASU has the better business school, law school, etc. Historically UofA is older. ASU started out as a teacher college and they because Arizona State University later, but has been a well respected University for many years.
*UofA is the Wildcats, it's a rivalry joke.
 
 
I can sort of see what K is saying. There is a distinction in CA between the UC system and the CSU system, yes? And in my state, I think of "state colleges" on a different level from "state universities." (I am not being judgy here; I interviewed for a job yesterday at a state college and it was a great place.)

a) I've always wondered what "State" the full name referes to: Virginia is a Commonwealth (as is PA--so I have the same thought about Penn State).
b) Yes, but who in their right mind would claim VATech is better than Mr. Jefferson's University ( The University of Virginia for the uneducated masses).  

And, yes, I am saying that tongue-in-cheek even as the only non-UVA grad in my family who has been taught "all dirt roads lead to VATech" since I could talk. I mean they both are better than Virginia Commonwealth Univeristy...

But both the UC system and the CSU systems have universities, right, not just four-year colleges? How can one have "state colleges" and the other have "state universities?" The difference between a college and a university is that a university has grad programs.
It's just an arbitrary naming thing. It has nothing to do with the quality of the school.
 
 
I went to Georgia Institute of Technology - not a university.
I think highly of my school. A non-university, state school.

Those were two separate examples.
1. UC vs. CSU (all universities, but UC schools tend to be ranked higher)
2. University of Georgia vs. Something in Georgia State College (flagship university vs. four-year college)

Per the GA Tech website:

"The Georgia Institute of Technology is one of the nation's top research universities, distinguished by its commitment to improving the human condition through advanced science and technology." (emphasis added)
Just because something doesn't have the word "university" in its name doesn't mean it isn't a university.
Another good example: Boston College, which is -- zomg -- a university, even though the name says "College"!
