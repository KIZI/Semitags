There are choking noises coming from the northeast again...

Hello squander, my old friend,
I’ve come to talk with you again,
A little dribbler softly creeping,
Another groundout leaves me weeping,
And the horror that is planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the walls of Fenway.

In restless dreams I walk alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
‘Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of
the ballpark lights
That split the night
And touched the walls of Fenway.

And in the naked light I saw
Thirty thousand people, maybe more.
People watching without cheering,
People jeering without listening,
People chanting taunts that fans should never share
And no one cared
Within the walls of Fenway.

Fools said I, you do not know
Ineptness like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.
But my words like silent popups fell,
And echoed
In the halls of Fenway

And the people bowed and prayed
To the baseball God they made.
And the scoreboard flashed its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the signs said the calls of the umpires
Are written on the Monster’s walls
The division falls.
And whispered in the sounds of silence.

(with apologies to Paul Simon)
