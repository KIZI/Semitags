U.S. on Friday decided that it will extend sanctions on Burma, according to a
statement issued by the White House.

"Because the actions and policies of the Government of Burma continues to pose
an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy
of the United States," the sanctions imposed on Burma will continue in effect
beyond May 20, said the statement.

The statement said the sanctions will be extended by one year.

U.S. accuses the government of Burma of committing "large-scale repression of
the democratic opposition," imposing sanctions on the southeastern Asian
country, including prohibition on new investment.
