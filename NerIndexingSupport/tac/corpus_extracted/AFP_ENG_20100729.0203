Mexican veteran Juan Manuel Marquez defends his lightweight title on Saturday
against American Juan Diaz in a rematch of their title slugfest from last year
that brought Marquez two titles.

Marquez knocked out Diaz in the ninth round in February of last year to retain
the World Boxing Association and World Boxing Organization lightweight crowns
that will again be at stake on Saturday.

"This fight is going to be better than the first one because Juan Diaz is a
great fighter and a great warrior and I am too," Marquez said.

"I like to fight. Everyone who knows me knows I like landing so many punches.
I've prepared very hard and I'm ready."

Marquez, 36, is a 3-1 betting favorite to defeat Diaz, 26, once again.

But Diaz, 35-3 with 17 knockouts, says the time has come for Marquez, 50-5 with
one drawn and 37 knockouts, to be replaced.

"It is time for the new generation to step up and reign over the lightweight
division," Diaz said. "It just makes sense that I am going to win this fight and
I am going to keep winning from now on."

Since losing to Marquez in his hometown, Diaz split two fights against
countryman Paul Malignaggi, winning a unanimous decision last August but losing
by unanimous decision four months later.

"We went back to the drawing board and tweaked a few things that Marquez
capitalized on in the first fight," said Diaz's trainer, Ronnie Shields.

That has put Diaz in solid form, according to his manager, Willie Savhannah.

"I've never seen him as in shape as he is for this fight. The public is going to
see a boxing machine," he said. "I'm telling you to go out and bet your house on
Diaz."

The only fight for Marquez since beating Diaz some 17 months ago came last
September when he stepped up to welterweight and lost to undefeated US star
Floyd Mayweather by unanimous decision.

The only other losses since 1999 for Marquez came at the hands of two other top
stars, unbeaten Indonesian Chris John in 2006 and Filipino legend Manny Pacquiao
in 2008.

Diaz, whose parents became US citizens after moving from Mexico, resists US,
Mexican or Hispanic fighter labels.

"I don't want to be any of that. I am 100 percent warrior," he said. "I fight
for all of my fans whether it is Mexicans, Mexican-Americans, Blacks, Whites or
Asians. I want to give everyone a great fight."
