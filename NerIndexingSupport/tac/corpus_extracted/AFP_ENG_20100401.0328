A Lebanese journalist who was maimed in a car bomb attack five years ago vowed
she would never be silenced after winning the International Press Institute's
award for heroism on Thursday.

The Vienna-based IPI said that May Chidiac's bravery since losing one of her
hands and one of her legs when a bomb went off under her car in September 2005
had been a source of inspiration for journalists around the world.

"May Chidiacâ€™s refusal as a journalist to bow to the threat of violence nearly
cost her her life, but has won her admiration around the world for her courage
and resilience," IPI director David Dadge said in a statement.

Chidiac, a journalist for the private LBC network who has been openly criticial
of Syria's influence in neighbouring Lebanon, said she herself was inspired by
the work of colleagues who have lost their lives.

"I will never regret speaking my mind," she said.

"I have to be the voice of those who are not here anymore. This is now my
mission. Nothing will ever stop me from saying the truth and what should be
said."

Chidiac returned to work in July 2006 after undergoing a series of operations in
Paris to attach an artificial hand and leg in the wake of the attack on the
northern outskirts of the Lebanese capital Beiruit.

Lebanon was plagued by a series of assassinations and attempted assassinations
between October 2004 and September 2005, notably the murder of former premier
Rafiq Hariri in a massive February 14 bomb blast.

Two other Lebanese journalists, Samir Kassir and Gebran Tueni, were among those
killed in similar attacks.

Other journalists to have recently been honoured by the IPI include the
assassinated Russian reporter Anna Politkovskaya and Sri Lankan correspondent
Lasantha Wickrematunge who was shot dead in January 2009.
