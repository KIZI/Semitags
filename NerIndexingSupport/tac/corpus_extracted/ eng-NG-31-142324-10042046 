SPRINGFIELD - A long-awaited measure authorizing release of new funding for schools, public safety and human services was sent to the governor's desk on Friday.

"The time has come; we need to pass this bill," said state Rep. Gary Hannig, D-Litchfield.

After months of delay, the budget implementation bill won unanimous approval in both the House and the Senate on Friday. Among other changes, it would raise the minimum per-pupil spending level by $400 to $5,734, and provide a $1,000 increase in the reimbursement rate for special education teachers, which has been stuck at $8,000 for more than two decades.
Gov. Rod Blagojevich's signature on the measure would mean almost $16 million to East Central Illinois schools, including $2.5 million for Danville schools, $1.6 million for Champaign schools, $262,000 for Urbana schools, $233,000 for Cerro Gordo and $86,000 for Tuscola.

State Rep. Bill Black, R-Danville, said he was grateful that the schools would finally get the money they had been promised in the state budget, but questioned a provision in the bill that called for a state-funded study on the feasibility of expanding Lincoln's Challenge, a military-style, alternative high school program in Rantoul
