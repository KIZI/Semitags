Philippine leader Gloria Arroyo's ruling coalition appeared to be in disarray
Thursday with just over a month before national elections to choose a new
president.

Arroyo's chosen presidential candidate, Gilberto Teodoro, this week resigned as
chairman of her Lakas Kampi CMD coalition, while many other senior leaders
defected to other parties.

"Gilbert Teodoro's resignation is a shock to me and (came) without any
consultation from us... the local troops are now confused over this event," said
House Speaker and top coalition member Prospero Nograles.

Nograles said in a statement sent to AFP on Thursday that even he, a former
vice-chairman of the party, did not know in advance of Teodoro's resignation.

"I am now confused and seem to be out of the loop," he said.

Teodoro announced on Tuesday that he had resigned as chairman of Lakas Kampi
CMD. His running mate, Edu Manzano, resigned as vice-chairman.

Teodoro's resignation came after several top Lakas Kampi CMD members defected to
support the candidacy of a main rival, Senator Manny Villar.

The defection of key party members to Villar's camp has fanned speculation that
Arroyo and her allies have abandoned Teodoro.

Claims that Teodoro quit to protest lack of support from Arroyo dominated the
Philippine media on Thursday.

However, Teodoro's office said in a statement he resigned as chairman to have
more time to devote to his presidential campaign.

Villar has also consistently denied any links to Arroyo, whose popularity
ratings are so low that her endorsement is seen as costing a candidate votes.

Three governors in the southern Philippines, including a provincial coalition
chairman, announced in recent days they were switching their support to Villar.

Former governor Luis 'Chavit' Singson -- a key Arroyo ally and political kingpin
in the northern Philippines -- also said he was switching from Teodoro to
Villar.

Surveys have shown that Teodoro lags a distant fourth in the race for the
presidency.

Villar is second, just behind Benigno 'Noynoy' Aquino, the son of recently
deceased democracy heroine Corazon Aquino.
