The National Police Agency (NPA) has set up a special "civic forum" corner on
its official Web site www.npa.gov.tw, on which members of the public are
encouraged to leave comments about the police and their work, a spokesman for
the agency said Tuesday.

A recent survey conducted by the Ministry of the Interior indicates that among
the 10 biggest complaints of the general public, several are related to public
safety and police work, rampant telephone and Internet scams, the high number of
traffic tickets issued and illegal occupation of public pathways.

The NPA is also hopeful that the public will also post stories about good deeds
done by policemen in addition to using the site as a space to voice their
complaints, according to the spokesman.

The spokesman also reminded the public that the forum is different from the 110
police service phone number and that reports of suspected criminal activities
should be made by calling 110 rather than by posting on the Web site.
