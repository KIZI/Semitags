 
 
Use of UD has lead to Iraqi Mutations
 
 
Substantial evidence has been presented to prove large quantities of Depleted Uranium (DU) has been used in Iraq since the invasion in 2003.
From  http://www.tehrantimes.com/index_View.asp?code=223505 

 
“UK forces used about 1.9 metric tons of depleted uranium ammunition in the Iraq war in 2003,” UK Defense Secretary Liam Fox said in a written reply to the House of Commons on Thursday,
 

 
The long- term effect of DU is a virtual death sentence. Iraq is a toxic wasteland. Anyone who is there stands a good chance of coming down with cancer and leukemia. In Iraq, the birth rate of mutations is totally out of control.
 

 
Iraq's Ministry for Human Rights is expected to file a lawsuit against Britain and the U.S. over their use of depleted uranium bombs in Iraq.
 

[Edit] Ok since alot of people think the 'Tehran Times' is untrustworthy I will give another source which gives the same information about Liam Fox's statement.
From  http://rt.com/Top_News/2010-07-24/uk...d-uranium.html  &  http://www.kuna.net.kw/NewsAgenciesP...95&Language=en 

 
"UK forces used about 1.9 metric tons of depleted uranium ammunition in the Iraq war in 2003," UK Defense Secretary Liam Fox said in a written reply to the House of Commons on Thursday,
 

[Edit]

From  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/wo...a-2034065.html 

 
Dramatic increases in infant mortality, cancer and leukaemia in the Iraqi city of Fallujah, which was bombarded by US Marines in 2004, exceed those reported by survivors of the atomic bombs that were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, according to a new study.
 

 
Iraqi doctors in Fallujah have complained since 2005 of being overwhelmed by the number of babies with serious birth defects, ranging from a girl born with two heads to paralysis of the lower limbs.
 

I can't bring myself to understand this in any way. I remember seeing some pictures of deformities a little while back and couldn't even believe it was humanly possible. They disturbed for a few days after and that's from someone who isn't easily upset. Back then I always believed that the leaders of our militaries would never allow this. They would never allow generations of Iraqi's to suffer from mutations and deformities like these. I passed it off as propaganda at the time but now the evidence seems substantial and clear that this is exactly what happened.

What is the most upsetting is that our taxes funded this. Our taxes causes girls to be born with two heads like something straight out of a horror film. How can this ever be rectified? How can you explain to the children why they are born with paralysed limbs or are born with their eyes formed inside out?
Your thoughts?
 
 
If this is true.

**** from us.
 
 
How can you rectify a system which has done to Iraq what it's done over the decades. From supporting tyrants, to watching on and doing nothing, to several large scale wars, to crippling sanctions. What harm were they afraid of from these ordinary, poor Iraqis. You can't rectify.
 
 
That's ******* disgusting and I hope the perpertrators are made to suffer what generations of Iraqi's already have and will ever endure. Remember those who champion themselves on human rights are actually the biggest terrorists in the world.
 
 
its bad, but it depends in which part of Iraq they were used.

Are you serious? Why does that matter? The answer is all over Iraq. Although it appears Fallujah has been affected the most.
[edit] Oh and read his news reports, it's all in there[edit]
 
 
Our 'heroes' are terrorists in their countries.

Their 'heroes' (not all of them think this way of course) are terrorists in our country.

This is messed up though.

A part of Iraq where there were humans...   what do you mean by that?
 
 
In two minds about this. War is hell I guess. It shocks me that people are suprised by these kind of things.

You aren't ******* surprised. Is there anything you wont whitewash as long as there are Muslims suffering from it.
 
 
We are at WAR for anybody who hasnt realised. What do you imagine it to be like?

I'd imagine they wouldn't use weaponary which causes cancer and mutations for generations to come. If this isn't one of your expectations, you should seriously question your morality.

I should question my morality because I have realised that war isnt fair?

Maybe you should take the rose tinted glasses off?
 
 
certain places like fallujah, tikrit, mosul atc, baathi scum strongholds deserve it for what they did to Iraq and the Iraqi people under saddam's(May God curse him) regime.

You do realise these are new born babies, so unless you inherit the crimes or sins of your ancestors this can't be used to justify it. Not to mention it is indiscriminate. You claim to be a Muslim yet you have forgotten "killing an innocent human being is like killing all of humanity."

This you can't seriously justify this by claiming it is their own fault and that they were deserving of this.

The hell are you talking about? I never said anything about Muslims or Islam. War is hell and both sides in a war will do anything they can. There is a stupid notion that war can be nice well its not. Its a horrible thing that should be avoided at all costs but when it happans you cant regulate it. Just hope you are on the winning side.

That's bull-**** and this has nothing to do with winning the war. Both sides will not necessarily do anything to win a war as you claim.

You absolutley can regulate it. This has been done for many years and these regulations stille exist. One example being the banning of White Phosphorus in civilian areas.

I will always and forever hope to be on the side of the freedom fighters and those who are fighting for justice no matter how weak. Not the simply the side who is winning if they are barbaric murders. Why would anyone want to be on their side.
 
 
I learned all this from the Anti-Flag song "Depleted Uranium is a war crime" about three years ago.

Its unfortunate that thier children are suffering. Perhaps the parents are being punished for their crimes by God, and as the children have no sin they would be guaranteed heaven.

But i guarantee you that had they of grown older they would have been with the wahabi scum and contribute to the destruction of Iraq. I have no compassion for them or thier types.

Good luck regulating war I can give you many examples of regulation's being broken.

Many countries will do anything to win a war, Germany in the First world war. Japan in the Second World war. America's use of torture.

And I did not feel the need to condemm this attack as many others have done so, it has nothing to do with the fact Muslims died, my point was that people should not be shocked by what goes on in war and as I said WAR IS HELL.

It is not unfortunate it is a War Crime. Stop whitewashing it. Them being guaranteed heaven is not a justification. Do you really believe God would punish innocent people just to harm a tiny minority of people who are guilty of crimes. Afterall, God is not injust in the least. I know you started on this thread claiming it had been brought upon them but surely on contemplation you can realise this is barbaric and condemn these actions right?

You cannot make this claim. In Islaam every one is born good and pure and therefore it is not for you to judge whether they will become evil and use this as justification.
Please tell me brother, do you actually condemn this?

That does not mean there are not those who fight and would choose not to do anything to win a war. There are those who would choose to fight with morality. In fact the USA chose not to Nuke Iraq to win the war.

I am sure you had the "War is Hell" rhetoric when the London trains were bombed in retaliation for the Iraq war. I am sure you never felt the need to condemn that.
Oh and it isn't about them dieing which is unavoidable in a War it is about the weaponary that was chosen which will create generations of mutants.
 
 
Ach well, that's a shame

Well yes I did as a terrorist act is different to a war. Bombing civilian targets in a deliberate act of terror is and I know you will not agree with this but it is very different to civilians dying in a war.

And no the USA did not nuke Iraq but they did use depleted Uranium shells as a way to win this war, and that counts as doing anything to win a war. They were willing to use a weapon that will cause mutation and deliberate suffering.
 
 
That's ******** for a start the US would not a shell a town with DU, it's high density means it is used for penetrator core for armour piercing sabot rounds, to be used against tanks. It's a kinetic energy round and would serve no purpose other than in a pitched tank battle, of which there weren't that many in GW2.

And that's the Independent article, I don't even need to bother trying to discredit something from the 'Tehran Times'.

Get a grip.
 
 
Well that's war isn't it? Never liked it but when war happens you have to expect any atrocities.

Your thoughts?

 

It's nonsense, you don't actually understand what DU is used for, it' not used in bombs. It's used in tank sabot rounds:
 

Because of it's high density it makes a very good penetrator core for piercing tank armour, the core usually relies on extreme velocity and kinetic energy rather than an explosion.

The Tehran times source said it was used in bombs, which is nonsense, it doesn't work like that, and the Independent said it was used in Fallujah, which was not a tank battle, and as such DU would have served no purpose and not been used. It's purely a specialist anti tank munition.

That is not true, it used on bunker busters in the form of a bomb.

  wahabi brigade has arrived.

Salam,

Firstly, being a Shia has nothing to do with it.

Secondly, please state where i have mentioned that they are sunni? Is this some sort of wahabi vision where you can see what others can not?

If you actually read, and understood, what i said, then those who are guilty of crimes deserved to get punished. Those places i mentioned were places that fully supported and helped your idol saddam(may God curse him).

I'm suprised at you, for one who claims to know so much about Shia beliefs, you do not know that Islamic Unity is a key belief. You need to do some more research it seems, and you also need to learn how to read what people have said without the use of your wahabi vision.
 
 
Extreme birth defects occur in lage numbers in ALL countries. Foetuses in this country thet have the wrong number of heads or limbs are usually terminated after the 12 week ultrasound.

I'm quite prepared to believe that munitions used in the Iraq war increase the risk of birth defects (it certainly sounds palusible) - but, unless you can provide reliable figures to show this is more common in areas with heavy fighting like Fallujah, how can you convince sceptics that this is anything beyond the normal occurence of birth defects?

I will leave idol worship to Shias. You quite clearly wish Muslims to be punished for the crimes of Saddam.

I am all for unity with muslims, not Shias.

The best you can do is make yourself look like an ignorant person who resorts to name-calling. Congratulations.

Spoiler:

I had a good laugh today at this fatwa of Rabbi Sextani

Question 30:
Is it permissible for multiple men to have mut'ah in succession without penetration, and with penetration in case the woman reached menopause?

Fatwah:
It is permissible without penetration if she did not reach menopause stage, and it is permissible with penetration if she reached menopause stage all this after completion of contract period (i.e mut'ah contract period which could be from 10 minutes to 99 years).

(prostitution)

Dirty old Sextani must be in those 'chastity house' all day!

Some of the mutations are twice the amount found by victims in Hiroshima and Nagaski. The sheer numbers and speed the mutations have grown at in Iraq contradict this concept that it happens everywhere

Anyway, i can't be bothered turning this thread into another Shia vs wahabi thread, as it is unfair to the OP, and it achieves nothing.

Spoiler:
It has been narrated from Abdur Rahmaan ibn Shayba; he says the Holy Prophet Peace & Blessings Be Upon Himsaid, "A rider should give salaam to a walking person, a walking person should give salaam to a seated person, a small group should give salaam to a larger group, whoever then responds to salaam, it is for his benefit, and he who does not respond to salaam, is not from amongst us." Ibn Sunni has narrated this and also Imaam Bukhari in his book Al Adabul Mufrad. On these bases Allama Nawawi in his commentary of Sahih Muslim has said, "To commence salaam is Sunnah and to reply is Wajib." Similarly Hafiz ibn Abdul Bar says, "It is an unanimous agreement of the Muslims that to commence Salaam is Sunnah and to reply is Wajib."

Returning salaams to a muslim is waajib. What's your point? You aren't one.

Keep going with the wahhabi phrase, you really make yourself look smart with it.

Hmmm I bet that sounded more intelligent in your head (and probably made sence).

Note (before you complain):

1)There have been no Iraqi (born) terrorist attacks in the UK.
2)British soldiers were fairly warmly welcomed into Iraq - particually in the part where there were frequent gas attack targetting specific parts of the population (Curds I believe).
But yes if the story is true (not totally sure) then it's pretty sickening!

When has it ever been denied? Since the conflict began it's been well reported by the BBC and American stations that DU weapons have been used. All service personel know that they're being used. There isn't a cover up, it's public knowledge  

You're clearly deluded or have been living under a rock if you think there's been a big denial surrounding the use the of depleted uranium, it's use is standard in many military forces around the world. The Russians and Chinese also use it in their weapons systems. It's used because of it's excellent armour piercing capabilities.

Sure we all want war to be just and we all think nothing like this should happen, but you'd be naive to think this is possible and this is how a war should be conducted.

What? Choosing weapons which do not cause mutations is absolutley possible and many wars have been conducted without these.

Riight.

So, to clarify, in this case you are on the side of innocent Saddam who definitely didn't gas like 100000 Iranians in the Iran Iraq war (think you have whitewashed over that islamic suffering?) and 10000 of his own kurdish people?  
Or just the remnants of his supporters left behind?

You seem to have conjured some moral supremacy in supporting opposition of part of an (successful) effort ending the regime of something far worse. Good job!

Depleted uranium is may have caused something horrific in Fallujah but maybe ponder the above before instantly trying to make this thread all about religion.

And lets not completely forget why the Americans were attacking Fallujah again.

Saddam was an evil dictator who I would have always opposed and have been happy executing myself. I never claimed to support him it is offensive you even make this claim.

Even the report you quote doesn't cite DU=cancer so there is still room for confusion and this was 6 years ago. Before this study even got started.

So still a tiny fraction of the population. Most people just want a stable government and the ability to live a simple life with their family, without fear of pursicution.

What is this occupation? Nato forces have left the country, yes some people will become resentful to the British, if this is true (which it doesn't seem to be seeing as it has had so limited press coverage).

Edit: I'm actually pretty sure it's false. The source is a Iranian news coperation (which means government controlled) and as such will only make stories that boost the regime/belittle the West.

The second source is about a UK military personel saying that some US bombings were badly coordinated
 
 
 Depleted Uranium is a War Crime?

I still argue that the terrorist attacks are worse, but not my much. When we use weapons like tis we lose all credibility, we claim to be freeing people yet use weapons that will scare people for years.

The GBU-28 'Deep Throat' was only used twice in GW1 to take out hardened, underground military complexes, and not with a DU tip, it doesn't need it, it will penetrate 100 feet of earth without it, why go to the extra expense of using DU? And what's more, there were no targets in GW2 that required that level of bunker buster, especially in Fallujah which was a disorganised insurrection mounted from houses and stuff.

I'm talking about actual use of DU, which is only used as an anti tank round, usually fired from a tank, or very rarely used from Bradleys or A 10s. It was used in GW1 and the sickness it caused in allied troops has meant it was not really been used again in Iraq.

I'm talking about actual use of DU, which is only used as an anti tank round, usually fired from a tank, or very rarely used from Bradleys or A 10s. It was used in GW1 and the sickness it caused in allied troops has meant it was not really been used again in Iraq.

 

However the DU was used, the fact remains 1.9 metric tons were used in the Iraq war since 2003.
[Edit] not questioning what you say here but do you have a source which shows which weapons used DU in GW1 and GW2. [edit]
 
 
It's a ******* war.

Don't tell me Muslim countries like Iran and pre-war Iraq wouldn't invoke such methods if they could.

Riight.

So, to clarify, in this case you are on the side of innocent Saddam who definitely didn't gas like 100000 Iranians in the Iran Iraq war (think you have whitewashed over that islamic suffering?) and 10000 of his own kurdish people?  
Or just the remnants of his supporters left behind?

You seem to have conjured some moral supremacy in supporting opposition of part of an (successful) effort ending the regime of something far worse. Good job!

Depleted uranium is may have caused something horrific in Fallujah but maybe ponder the above before instantly trying to make this thread all about religion.

And lets not completely forget why the Americans were attacking Fallujah again.

The Tehran times source said it was used in bombs, which is nonsense, it doesn't work like that, and the Independent said it was used in Fallujah, which was not a tank battle, and as such DU would have served no purpose and not been used. It's purely a specialist tank munition.

 

Ermm no its not it was used in Barret rifles long before it was used as a tank munition, although the Barret uranium round is banned under UN law, but i doubt that would of stopped that idiot bush from allowing it to be used

Oh come on, the 'Tehran Times'? Do you not think they might be prone to lying about the infidel, pigdog, great satans in the UK.

Nah I don't have a source I could call up offhand, most of it is stuff I pick up from reading MP.net and I can't be arsed to try and search for it as the advanced search is for members only.

I'd say mutations and stuff is far more likely to be caused by events in GW1 like Khamisiyah or something.

You kind of pissed on your own fire there. And that's supposd to read 'anti-tank' I just haven't edited yet.

Well if Iran would do it, then it is completely justifiable.  
 
 
It seems odd that the Tehran times has managed to get hold of this statement by our defense secretary but it seems to have skipped past the British media.

Speculative at the moment.

Sorry but without a source I can't really just take your word as fact. Because people on the internet sometimes lie.

Ah fair enough, it has only been banned in the last 2 years though ? i think. i will try and find source, but it is used in alot of heavy machine guns, particularly the gatlin gun on board 'copters and various attack aircraft.

OMGZ TEH GOVERNMENT IS OUT 2 GET US

Just like they censored the reporting on the Ian Tomlinson enquiry, the beheading of Al-Qaeda soldiers by a gurka, the expenses scandal etc etc etc.

....and all of the articles use the same source.

Fail.

Seems to have skipped past the French, Spanish, Italian, German, Swedish, Finnish, Belgian, Russian, Australian, New Zealand, Danish, Portugese, Japanese, Chinese, African media as well.

TIS A CONSPIRACY.

are you sick? you do realise that INNOCENT people also live in them places who may have been against what happened in Iraq. You just over-generalised on such a huge scale. And even so the generation itself don't deserve that punishment! Oh yeah there's a bad guy, his children and grandchildren deserve to be mutated, what kind of logic is that

I'm not saying it isn't true, I'm saying I'm not listening to the Tehran Times.

I find it odd that a globally well known news source could fabricate this kind of thing. It goes far beyond biased sources.

OK now I have a source you (I hope) will find reliable.  http://rt.com/Top_News/2010-07-24/uk...d-uranium.html

But yes if the story is true (not totally sure) then it's pretty sickening!

 

The irony.

Reports have emerged that the UK used depleted uranium weapons during the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. A UK defense official has reportedly admitted using highly controversial ammunition.

"UK forces used about 1.9 metric tons of depleted uranium ammunition in the Iraq war in 2003," UK Defense Secretary Liam Fox said in a written reply to the House of Commons Thursday, Iranian Press TV reported, citing the Kuwait News Agency.

It is alleged that a joint inquiry by Iraq’s environment, health and science ministries uncovered more than 40 sites across the war-torn country contaminated with high levels of radiation.

The use of uranium ammunition is widely controversial because of potential long-term health effects. The US and UK have allegedly used up to 2,000 tons of such ammunition during the war.

British Labor Party MP Paul Flynn says the depleted uranium still causes serious health problems.

“We know that in the first Iraq war depleted uranium was used in shells. It’s very likely it was used again,” Flynn said. “It’s used as ballast because of its density in shells. It’s not as radioactive as it might be, it’s uranium 238 where the gamma-radiation has been reduced and it’s not the weapon of mass destruction, but sadly it’s a weapon of eternal destruction because it turns into dust and gets into the water supply, into the air and it can of course give children cancer, it can cause birth defects.”

Iraq's Ministry for Human Rights is expected to file a lawsuit against Britain and the US over their use of depleted uranium bombs in Iraq and will seek compensation for the victims of these weapons.
 

Yawn.
 
 
And then people complain about terrorism

Well seeing as Press TV reported it from a Kuwaiti news source and Kuwait is very pro Western seeing as they saved them from the Iraqis, my point still stands

Exactly this.

And the sad thing is, so many people in the UK are so detached from Britain's effect on Iraq that it isn't even a major electioneering issue. So election after election, hardly anything changes for the poor people of Iraq.

Truly disgusting.

" no burdened person (with sins) shall bear the burden (sins) of another " (53/38).

This concept is quite clear in Islam, a person who has done murder cannot have their family killed for it, this is not justice. The views you hold are quite repulsive to say the least, and against Islamic principles which I'm sure you'll agree.

Thaks that really opens your eyes. Of course the odd member on this forum will just, give the bull-****, 'War is hell' rhetoric to justify the crimes. Amazing how the US condemned the leak of this information but not any of the actual crimes committed.

DU was always toxic, and the top brass and manufacturers knew this in the first place. The defence industry continues to cover up the truth about its toxicity, they have no problem giving cancer to Iraqi and Afghan civilians as long as they profit from it.

Disturbing defects

No I never said that actually that evil tyrannical bastard deserved to be hanged. How many remnants of his supporters are left, anyway? Please dont tell me you think the insurgents are still fighting for Saddam

first of all, it's SENSE

second, i wasn't referring to Iraq specifically, but also Afghanistan, where we seem to be killing so many unnamed civilians. Wonder if those people who lost a relative because of our troops are welcoming as well.
