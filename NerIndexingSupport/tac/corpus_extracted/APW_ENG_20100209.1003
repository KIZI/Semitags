A graduate student from China accused of triggering worldwide flight delays has pleaded not guilty to charges stemming from a security breach at Newark Liberty International Airport.

A lawyer for Haisong Jiang entered the innocent plea to the defiant trespassing charge in Municipal Court in Newark on Tuesday. The misdemeanor charge carries a fine of up to $500.

Jiang appeared in a dark suit and sneakers. His lawyer sought a delay to review surveillance video.

Authorities say Jiang entered a restricted area at the airport Jan. 3 to see off his girlfriend. The breach shut down a busy terminal and snarled flights worldwide.

Jiang, a Rutgers University student, was arrested Jan. 8.
