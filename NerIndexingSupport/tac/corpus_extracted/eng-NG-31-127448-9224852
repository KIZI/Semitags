Bush, if he was arrested, tried, and executed for war crimes, corruption,
and treason.

That would be a big step towards a better world.

You misspelled Clinton.
You know, the guy who:

Blew up an embassy.

Launched massive airstrikes against a nation we were not at war with,
that did not threaten us, did not threaten its neighbors, and he did so
against the wishes of the UN and NATO. Oh, and he used deliberately
falsified intelligence reports of atrocities to justify it.

Knowingly allowed foreign agents into secret State Department meetings
in exchange for illegal contributions.

Illegally transferred technology to unfriendly countries by channelling
it through the Commerce Department.

Clinton was still very popular when he left office.

 

The Democrats had already lost Congress.

 

Lost the elections because of their own failings.  It is arguable that if
Gore had let Clinton do some campaigning for him, Gore might have got enough
to get over the Florida scam.

 

This doesn't even make sense.

 

I have no idea whether she is or not, and neither do you.  She was just a

Somewere I read that over his two terms in office Cuban Americans were

before the election that could hve offended the Cuban voters and make
them solidly Republican again. I wonder what that was... (*- see
below)

Perhaps the effect may not have amounted to the difference in Florida,
but its possible. And Gore was going up against Nader which had its
own effect nationwide.

The DNC has still got me pissed off about the delegation seating thing
at the next convention. Florida is a swing state with blue dog
conservative Democrats who may not take kindly to a turned nose at the
primary or controversy at the convention over the delegation from
Florida. These conservative Democrats might go all boll weevil on the
DNC and turn Republican (shades of Reagan landslide). Liberal
Democrats might go Green if they are pissed enough. Independents might
see how the DNC treats Democratic voters and swing Republican. The
Republicans aren't slapping the hands of Republican voters as much,
maybe cutting the Florida delegation in half. I have seen plenty of
Romney commercials already. He's getting an early subconcious impact
on the undecided come next November ('08).  Republicans can use this
DNC dust up to their advantage coaxing Democrats to switch parties via
mailers and other media pressure. A Republican candidate for president
will surely, along with Republican strategists, use this against the
Democratic contender, saying how the Democrats alienated Floerida
voters.

November rolls around. The final tally...Florida overwhelmingly goes
as a Red state. Tight election. Florida's electoral votes, and perhaps
Michigan's if they are in the same bind with the DNC right now, tips
the balance and the Republican candidate is sitting in the Oval Office
come January 2009.

Mark my words!

*- OTOH the dipshit Republicans, except McCain IIRC snubbed the debate
in Miami to a bilingual Hispanic audience. In the large Hispanic
voters might tend towards the Democrats, especially given the issues
surrounding immigration but also other key issues. As a bloc, the
Cuban segment of Hispanic voters have, since the Bay of Pigs, been
largely Republican. The Republicans might have alienated enough Cubans
(not sure) by ignoring a Spanish language broadcast debate in Miami to
have an impact next November. Not sure if this will polarize Cubans
away from the Republicans as much as Clinton's treatment of Elian
Gonzalez polarized them towards Dubya in '00.

Sunshine State politics lesson over.

Klaus isn't quite so bad as Fred Stone, but when your defense of Bush goes
from strong "he's fighting terrorism" and "his tax cuts will save the
economy" to "Clinton was a bastard", I think there's something of a tacit
admission that there's a problem.

Up here in Canada, I'm watching with fascination (and mixed feelings) the
results of Bush's domestic economic policies as the Canadian dollar sits
above parity, and the US dollar nosedives compared to a number of other
important currencies.

The real pity is that the full fallout of Bush's various policies foreign
and domestic won't be felt after he has left the stage, and whoever his
lucky successor is will bear the brunt of it all, and will, naturally,
receive all the blame for his predecessor's intense incompetence.

Unfortunately, the head of the Federal Reserve is one of those "for

woes, it's Alan Greenspan (aside from Bush spending billions in Iraq
to zero benefit). Paul Volcker (put in by Carter) reined in the
rampant inflation of the 70's. Greenspan, put in by Ray-Gun, presided
over bubble after bubble, all the while providing bailouts to the
wealthy. Our money crisis is bad and it's gonna get much, much worse,
since Benny is from the same mold as Greenspan.

I've heard a lot of variations of plans for US withdrawal

I've yet to hear anyone propose a remotely plausible plan
for peace...at least not in Iraq, Israel or Darfur.

So, who are these "peace candidates" of which you write?

Maybe, but just as importantly not to buy into rubbish like "we're going to
get out of the war today", because it's a fantasy that could only be made by
worse by someone sufficiently incompetent to actually try to do it.

Make no mistake, I'm against the war in Iraq, but the genie is out of the
bottle and running away and hiding in the sand won't make it go away.

Actually, a complete and unilateral pullout is the only plan that has
any practical potential to result in peace in the long run.  Yes, the
genie is out of the bottle, but no amount of troops are going to be
able to put it back in.  The best that can be accomplished other than
a pullout is to get more deeply involved in the civil war, either by
picking a side or fighting all sides at once, and neither of those
options are going to result in peace.

I'm not convinced that walking away will produce peace.  I have yet to see
anyone actually make an argument for it.  It's my proposition that staying
and being targets for insurgents and at least containing the civil war is
preferable to the other options.

Some say that a pullout will result in a civil war.  The problem is
there is already a civil war.  Pullout won't result in what is already
there.  Some say that the US presence contains the civil war, others
say that it turns a 2 way fight into a 3 way fight (or more accurately
an N way fight into an N+1 way fight).

So other than introducing one more military force into the civil war
what does the US presence do?  The various forces use the US presence
as a recruiting tool, while meanwhile the US is constantly switching
the official position on the many forces as to whether they are good
or bad, and giving them supplies while they are good, as well as
giving supplies to the Iraqi "government" which end in the hands of
the various forces.

If left alone, yes, there will be fighting, just like there is now.
If left alone, eventually the fighting there will come to some sort of
conclusion.  If not left alone, the fighting will continue
indefinitely.

Leaving isn't a good option, it's merely the best of the bad options.

In all of this mess, I've seen some arguments that are essentially
baseless rhetoric:

- Equating US pullout with _peace_ (as in PEACE NOW signs)

- Thinking [hyper-Sunni] Al Qaeda will have a base for launching
worldwide terrorist attacks in [Shi'ite majority] Iraq.  The
US presence in Iraq gives them a recruitable cause with local
convenience.

Personally, I'm of the position "if you break it, you've bought it",
such that the US is morally responsible for doing what it can to
clean up the mess.  Considering the overstretched troops, the
intractable hatreds, the innately artificial national boundaries,
the hypocrisy of allowing Kurdish terrorists to use Iraqi territory
to launch attacks against Turkey, the sect-based ministries of the
Iraqi "government", and the ineffectiveness of the parliament, I
think withdrawing militarily and redirecting the billions to
refugee relief would be the least-bad overall response.

Of course, with US withdrawal, the Crusading Westerners are out
of the picture, and neighboring Sunni-majority Syria and Saudi
Arabia would _have_ to deal with Shi'ite-majority Iran, whether
diplomatically and/or militarily.

That's a fantasy, of course, since we'd never risk letting Iran
get control of Iraq's oil.

As has been pointed out to, that region has been active for millions of

Dawkins writes best-selling books, is well-respected by his colleagues and
I've never heard of him not having friends.  Perhaps you could give us some
