While I am thinking about it the Lakers not only did not make the spread last
night but were blown out by the Hornets at home. I really doubt they were
heavy underdogs.

Also, Deborah Norville made comments on my local radio show about Brian
Williams on Saturday Night Live. But nothing relating to the strike despite he
hosted the unscripted show with staff writers.
