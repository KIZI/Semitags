Just received information from Accessible Arts regarding a Captioned
Film.

A special fundraiser screening of Australian documentary A Good Man
will take place on September 5. A Good Man, by Safina Uberoi, is the
true story of a struggling Australian farmer, his quadriplegic wife,
their newborn baby and their plans to open a brothel in a small
country town.

The film will be captioned for the hearing impaired and will be
followed by a Q&A with the film-makers. All proceeds from the
screening will go towards creating a fully accessible version of the
film with captions for the hearing impaired and audio-description for
the vision impaired.

A Good Man, co-winner of the Best Documentary Award at the recent
Sydney Film Festival, was described by the Festival jury as ‘a human
story of huge heart told with candour and humour.’

Accessible Arts is pleased to provide support and sector information
to the producers of A Good Man for: the incorporation of access
technology in the film; marketing to key organisations and for future
accessible screenings of A Good Man in cinemas and television.

Where: The Chauvel Cinema, cnr Oxford st and Oatley rd, Paddington
