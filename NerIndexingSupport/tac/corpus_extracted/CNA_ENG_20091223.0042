Some Taiwanese solar cell manufacturers have fallen prey to a recent financial
crisis involving China-based LDK Solar Co., a manufacturer of multicrystalline
solar wafers,  which are the principal raw material used to produce solar cells.

Those Taiwanese companies have forged business ties under a so-called bridge-
building  project launched by the Ministry of Economic Affairs in May.

In just half a year, the bridge-building project for the photovoltaics industry
has alomst become a "dead-end" bridge.

We hope the case will serve as a wake-up call for President Ma Ying-jeou's
administration which has been conducting a pro-China policy since its
inauguration in May 2008.

Believing China is the only relief for Taiwan's economic ills, the Ma
administration has come up with economic stimulus packages centering around
opening up to China.

As a result, many measures unveiled by economic and financial affairs have
further fed the craze for the industrial exodus to China.

Even the quasi-official  Taiwan External  Trade Development (TAITRA) has shifted
its traditional focus on the global market to a China-oriented strategy.

Since early this year, the trade promotion organization has organized more than
10 so-called bridge-building forums to help mediate cross-strait trade or joint-
venture deals.

It seems that TAITRA  has narrowed  its role as Taiwan's international trade
promotion organization to China's arm to attract Taiwanese investment and
mediate cross-strait business deals.

Furthermore, TAITRA has helped with China's procurement mission drama. While
China has announced plans to procure US$10 billion worth of goods from Taiwan,
the amount of orders Chinese business groups actually placed fall far below that
promised target.

Taiwanese people are not fools as evidenced in the large number of demonstrators
who have braved frigid cold weather to protest against the current round of
cross-strait talks.
