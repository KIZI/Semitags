Obama - Messiah Comparisons Growing and Spreading

  2008-11-08T12:31:11  
I've been noting for a while that the messianic projection of Obama
has been met by an equal reaponse by his followers.  I mentioned the
time in the Germany speech, where he said the whole world has been
waiting for his time to come (really said that).  Then, there was
Farakan saying that Obama's words were the messiah speaking (really
said THAT).  There was the manifest Obama website that sang a hymn in
the background and said Obama would save the world.

I didn't know, however, that someone was actually chronicling this
movement.  I cannot tell from the website if they are being over the
top satirical or if they REALLY think Obama is the Messiah, but they
provide a wealth of links in the press to the Messiah's rise...

http://obamamessiah.blogspot.com/

World Net Daily brought the site to the attention of their readers
here...

http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=57090

...where they threw in a few notes, such as a slate.com commentator
saying that "we can't dismiss this possibility out of hand" (about
Obama being the second coming).

It is a fascinating site, although the Obama - Messiah sites seem to
be shutting down after being discovered (why would they run from the
attention...I think someone is shutting them down to operate in
darkness).  However, the numerous quotes are undeniable, and the
magazine cover pages are a part of public record to check out.

When you have statements like I don't know, and I cannot tell,
that should be your first clue to shut the fuck up.

But you continue to show your complete ignorance, and blather on.

Didn't anyone ever tell you if you don't have something nice to say,
shut your mouth??

Smile.

You people are at it once again!  You have picked
your next target as "The Anti-Christ", just as I had
said you would!

Now where are your letters of apology to both
Saddam's family, for wrongly accusing him of
being "The Anti-Christ", as well as George Bush?!

Now it's this guy whom you have targeted,
calling it you being some "Bible prophecy expert"
and falsely claiming that "The Holy Spirit told me",
etc., etc.!

And when he leaves office and he wasn't "The Anti-Christ",
once again, there will be no apologies from your camp!
But rather again, you will just pick your next target,
never admitting you were wrong the last time and
denigrating another person!

Yea, you serve God!  Sure!  Right! (:

The Last Days were in the first century:

Romans 13:11-2

11) And that, knowing the time, that NOW
it is high time to awake out of sleep:
for NOW is our salvation nearer than when
we believed.
12) The night is far spent, the day is
AT HAND: let us therefore cast off the
works of darkness, and let us put on
the armor of light.

There is no "movement", idiot.

 

That is because you have the social awareness of a ... member of the
religious reich.  i.e. none.

 

I suspect that you'll find a reference or two somewhere in the
archives of The Onion, and you'll probably believe them, too.

 

Here is what the article said about the slate commentator:
<Slate.com's Timothy Noah introduced last year his tongue-in-cheek
< "Obama Messiah Watch," a periodic feature "considering evidence that
< Obama is the Son of God."

You must be one of the few people who doesn't know what
"tongue-in-cheek" means.

It's pretty bad when you are serious, and your posting history reads
like a "tongue-in-cheek" blog.

Kennie the Wonder Klown is a joke - a BAD joke.

Once the Florida election was settled and the SC selected Bush to be
president Gore made a gracious concession speech and the vitriol died down.

The first summer of Bush's term was somnolent --- nobody, especially
Bush while on vacation, did much of anything. New appointments were
sailing through the repuglicon dominated congress and other change of
administration tasks went on apace.

When 9/11's attacks shocked the country just about everyone rallied
around Bush. He got ALL of his measures passed by large margins, and he
got authorizations for his invasions.

Then it started to come out about how badly he planned the invasion of
Iraq and how much of the evidence for invasion was , shall we say,
dubious. Revelations about ineptitude by Bush appointees at DOJ that
allowed 9/11 hijackers to escape detection was unveiled. Film of Bush
sitting dumbfounded when given the news of the attack got wide
distribution. Katrina hit. Budget deficits exploded,. The economy tanked.

The negative judgments against Bush were about his actions in office.

You, and the other right wing haters, aren't even waiting for the
inauguration to spew hatred. The FBI and SS are tracking an escalating
number of racist threats. Right wing groups are funding a SCOTUS
challenge to Obama's legitimacy (not born in USA) , Berg v Obama. Right
wing groups are trying to organize a filibuster against the counting of
the electoral votes. The RNC has launched viscous public attacks on
Obama's only two official acts --- his choices for chief of staff and
press secretary.

And millions of idiots like you  lie, misrepresent the Bible, call Obama
a racist, Muslim, socialist, predict the end of the world, and threaten
to destroy the US by scuttling _any_ attempt by Obama and the congress
to fix the economy, social problems., budget, Iraq and Afghanistan, or
any other initiative.

Roast in hell, false Christian.

It didn't happen for the decades from 1949 to 1987 when it was in

The answer is that you have NO CLUE what the Fairness Doctrine is, and

So have Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity over and over. However,
Limbaugh attributes the expression to Louis Farrakan. In a recording

Interesting.

I just finished reading, in its entirety, the transcript of Obama's
speech in Berlin:

OBAMA SPEECH TRANSCRIPT:
Remarks of Senator Barack Obama (as prepared for delivery)

"A World that Stands as One"

July 24th, 2008

Berlin, Germany

Thank you to the citizens of Berlin and to the people of Germany. Let
me thank Chancellor Merkel and Foreign Minister Steinmeier for
welcoming me earlier today. Thank you Mayor Wowereit, the Berlin
Senate, the police, and most of all thank you for this welcome.

I come to Berlin as so many of my countrymen have come before.
Tonight, I speak to you not as a candidate for President, but as a
citizen - a proud citizen of the United States, and a fellow citizen
of the world.

I know that I don't look like the Americans who've previously spoken
in this great city. The journey that led me here is improbable. My
mother was born in the heartland of America, but my father grew up
herding goats in Kenya. His father - my grandfather - was a cook, a
domestic servant to the British.

At the height of the Cold War, my father decided, like so many others
in the forgotten corners of the world, that his yearning - his dream -
required the freedom and opportunity promised by the West. And so he
wrote letter after letter to universities all across America until
somebody, somewhere answered his prayer for a better life.

That is why I'm here. And you are here because you too know that
yearning. This city, of all cities, knows the dream of freedom. And
you know that the only reason we stand here tonight is because men and
women from both of our nations came together to work, and struggle,
and sacrifice for that better life.

Ours is a partnership that truly began sixty years ago this summer, on
the day when the first American plane touched down at Templehof.

On that day, much of this continent still lay in ruin. The rubble of
this city had yet to be built into a wall. The Soviet shadow had swept
across Eastern Europe, while in the West, America, Britain, and France
took stock of their losses, and pondered how the world might be
remade.

This is where the two sides met. And on the twenty-fourth of June,
1948, the Communists chose to blockade the western part of the city.
They cut off food and supplies to more than two million Germans in an
effort to extinguish the last flame of freedom in Berlin.

The size of our forces was no match for the much larger Soviet Army.
And yet retreat would have allowed Communism to march across Europe.
Where the last war had ended, another World War could have easily
begun. All that stood in the way was Berlin.

And that's when the airlift began - when the largest and most unlikely
rescue in history brought food and hope to the people of this city.

The odds were stacked against success. In the winter, a heavy fog
filled the sky above, and many planes were forced to turn back without
dropping off the needed supplies. The streets where we stand were
filled with hungry families who had no comfort from the cold.

But in the darkest hours, the people of Berlin kept the flame of hope
burning. The people of Berlin refused to give up. And on one fall day,
hundreds of thousands of Berliners came here, to the Tiergarten, and
heard the city's mayor implore the world not to give up on freedom.
"There is only one possibility," he said. "For us to stand together
united until this battle is won...The people of Berlin have spoken. We
have done our duty, and we will keep on doing our duty. People of the
world: now do your duty...People of the world, look at Berlin!"

People of the world - look at Berlin!

Look at Berlin, where Germans and Americans learned to work together
and trust each other less than three years after facing each other on
the field of battle.

Look at Berlin, where the determination of a people met the generosity
of the Marshall Plan and created a German miracle; where a victory
over tyranny gave rise to NATO, the greatest alliance ever formed to
defend our common security.

Look at Berlin, where the bullet holes in the buildings and the somber
stones and pillars near the Brandenburg Gate insist that we never
forget our common humanity.

People of the world - look at Berlin, where a wall came down, a
continent came together, and history proved that there is no challenge
too great for a world that stands as one.

Sixty years after the airlift, we are called upon again. History has
led us to a new crossroad, with new promise and new peril. When you,
the German people, tore down that wall - a wall that divided East and
West; freedom and tyranny; fear and hope - walls came tumbling down
around the world. From Kiev to Cape Town, prison camps were closed,
and the doors of democracy were opened. Markets opened too, and the
spread of information and technology reduced barriers to opportunity
and prosperity. While the 20th century taught us that we share a
common destiny, the 21st has revealed a world more intertwined than at
any time in human history.

The fall of the Berlin Wall brought new hope. But that very closeness
has given rise to new dangers - dangers that cannot be contained
within the borders of a country or by the distance of an ocean.

The terrorists of September 11th plotted in Hamburg and trained in
Kandahar and Karachi before killing thousands from all over the globe
on American soil.

As we speak, cars in Boston and factories in Beijing are melting the
ice caps in the Arctic, shrinking coastlines in the Atlantic, and
bringing drought to farms from Kansas to Kenya.

Poorly secured nuclear material in the former Soviet Union, or secrets
from a scientist in Pakistan could help build a bomb that detonates in
Paris. The poppies in Afghanistan become the heroin in Berlin. The
poverty and violence in Somalia breeds the terror of tomorrow. The
genocide in Darfur shames the conscience of us all.

In this new world, such dangerous currents have swept along faster
than our efforts to contain them. That is why we cannot afford to be
divided. No one nation, no matter how large or powerful, can defeat
such challenges alone. None of us can deny these threats, or escape
responsibility in meeting them. Yet, in the absence of Soviet tanks
and a terrible wall, it has become easy to forget this truth. And if
we're honest with each other, we know that sometimes, on both sides of
the Atlantic, we have drifted apart, and forgotten our shared destiny.

In Europe, the view that America is part of what has gone wrong in our
world, rather than a force to help make it right, has become all too
common. In America, there are voices that deride and deny the
importance of Europe's role in our security and our future. Both views
miss the truth - that Europeans today are bearing new burdens and
taking more responsibility in critical parts of the world; and that
just as American bases built in the last century still help to defend
the security of this continent, so does our country still sacrifice
greatly for freedom around the globe.

Yes, there have been differences between America and Europe. No doubt,
there will be differences in the future. But the burdens of global
citizenship continue to bind us together. A change of leadership in
Washington will not lift this burden. In this new century, Americans
and Europeans alike will be required to do more - not less.
Partnership and cooperation among nations is not a choice; it is the
one way, the only way, to protect our common security and advance our
common humanity.

That is why the greatest danger of all is to allow new walls to divide
us from one another.

The walls between old allies on either side of the Atlantic cannot
stand. The walls between the countries with the most and those with
the least cannot stand. The walls between races and tribes; natives
and immigrants; Christian and Muslim and Jew cannot stand. These now
are the walls we must tear down.

We know they have fallen before. After centuries of strife, the people
of Europe have formed a Union of promise and prosperity. Here, at the
base of a column built to mark victory in war, we meet in the center
of a Europe at peace. Not only have walls come down in Berlin, but
they have come down in Belfast, where Protestant and Catholic found a
way to live together; in the Balkans, where our Atlantic alliance
ended wars and brought savage war criminals to justice; and in South
Africa, where the struggle of a

This is simply the newspaper prophets at it again!

I have been saying that the end timers simply get
their "prophecy revealed" from the daily news.

So my question is; Do you believe me now that
we see another President come into office and
the end timers are now claiming that he is
"The Anti-Christ"?

But will there be any admissions that they were
wrong about the last target they picked?  Will
there be any letters of apology to him?  No!

Rather, all we will see, is attacks on Barack and
now that the old books have been pulled off of
the shelves, we'll see the authors scrambling to
write new versions of their books that name
Obama as "The Anti-Christ", without ever even
mentioning the last version of their books and
that will tell us how, "No other person in history
could have fulfilled the prophecies of the Bible
regarding The Anti-Christ as Barack Obama does!",
which is what they always say about every person!

The fact is, they have just picked their new target
and it's just more newspaper prophecy! (:

But will anybody believe me now?  No!  Of course not,
because that would mean that they would have to admit
to what their Futurism is all about!  And we can't have
that, can we?!  To do that, would mean doing the
Christian thing and apologizing to those that they
have accused in the past and to stop pointing their
finger at people and slandering/libeling them while
trying to claim it's okay, because the Bible says so!

They are newspaper prophets, plain and simple! (:

Do you believe me now?  Or will you be like them
and not want to say anything, because you don't
want to go against the grain and alienate these
newspaper losers, who falsely call what they do
"Christianity"?

Then why wasn't calling our current president "Shrub" or "Dubya" halted
several years ago? You people dislike the POTUS and ridiculed him every
chance you had. Now the shoe is on the other foot and we're all supposed to
be good Germans and follow orders from you nazis? You made fun of the
president's middle name/initial, let's just call the president elect by his
middle name, Hussein!
NOBAMA!

Tom's whole fundamentalist position is about HATE and INSULT.

Tom claims to have a very high IQ and be learned in all maner of subjects
but is UNABLE to provide one lucid statement without an insult.

Tom can only insult and NEVER DEBATE.

Fundamentalists seem aimed at making themselves feel better by placing all
negative and destructive emotions in people with different beliefs, and
enjoying the golden glow of self-justification that results. ... You know
that simile: 'As rare as a Fundamentalist who loves his enemy.' ... the
Inquisition did largely miss the point of 'Love Thy Neighbour', didn't they?
Wasn't burning heretics 'worse' than being tolerant towards them? ...

That's hardly even close to the truth.

The US Congress (especially the Senate) was in a definite "foot dragging"
mode.   The public saw this and that was why the GOP did very well in the
2002 elections.

In particular, the defeat of Max Cleland (sp?) of Georgia happend because
Max let himself be led by the nose by the democRAT leadershp.   Max was
popular and didn't need to kis the asses of his liberal leaders.

No.  A substantial number of people who voted for his opponent did so
because they weren't sure that Obama was ready, or because they liked
McCain's positions better.

Note that Democrats who supported Gore helped give Bushwhack even
higher positive ratings once he was elected - his approval scores were
above 90% when he took office.  It wasn't until late in 2003 when his
approval rating dropped to under 60% that you could claim that
Democrats were anything but the supportive loyal opposition.  Too bad
the reich wing isn't willing to offer similar good will towards Obama
until his actions display the incompetence that Bush showed.

So why don't you choose to teach by example instead of bringing yourself
down to the level of the lowest common denominator?  Be better than they
were. If you do what they did, then you're no better than they were, are
you?
