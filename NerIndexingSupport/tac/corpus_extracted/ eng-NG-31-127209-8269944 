Most of America HATES the New York Yankees,
and was enormously pleased earlier this season
when the Yankees were nowhere near contending.
But now they've come alive again, so I offer, on
behalf of baseball fans everywhere (except New
York), the following pleas to all AL teams
other than the Yankees:

1) If you're playing against the Yankees, please win.
2) If you're a serious wild-card contender, please
win. Â (If two contenders, neither of them the Yankees,
are playing each other, then I suppose I have to root
for the one with a better chance of beating the
Yankees for the wild card.)
3) If you're the Boston Red Sox, for God's sake win!
A howl of agony would arise from all America if
the Yankees bite you in the butt and steal the
division from you at the end of the season.
