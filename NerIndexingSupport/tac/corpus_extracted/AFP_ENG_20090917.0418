Scotland star Gary Caldwell has warned Celtic he will be looking for a new club
unless they come up with an improved contract offer.

Caldwell, who can operate as a defensive midfielder as well as at centreback,
will be a free agent at the end of this season and the 27-year-old could sign a
pre-contract with another club in January.

He insisted that the new deal he was seeking would simply bring him into line
with other first-team regulars.

"If the club say that's too much then I think they are kidding themselves on
that they can pay others a lot more than they can pay me," he said.

He added: "As I've said in the past, I want to play for Celtic and want to sign
for Celtic. That's always been my stance and it's the club who have not been
forthcoming.

"Allowing my contract to run down could probably be good for me financially, but
I have a young family and we want to stay in Scotland with Celtic."
