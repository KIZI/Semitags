A European Union report says grasslands, wetlands and butterflies are threatened in Europe.

The report says the increase of land for farm use, climate change, tourism and poor land management are to blame for the loss of biodiversity across the 27-nation bloc. The study, released Monday, assessed 216 habitats and 1,182 species.

The report compiled national statistics from across the EU. It concluded 65 percent of habitats and 52 percent of species are considered in bad or unfavorable conservation status.

EU Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas is calling on member states to step up efforts to set aside land for conservation.

EU countries have agreed to put aside 17 percent of their territory to preserve habitats.
