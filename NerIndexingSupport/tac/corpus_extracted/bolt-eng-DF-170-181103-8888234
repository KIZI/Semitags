Romney wins by 8 fucking votes...A state that he was beat by nearly 10 percent by Hickabee in 2008. He is expected to Win new hempshire by 20 points within 7 days...McCain beat him hard there in 2008....>Totally different game for Mitt then 2008 this year.

S.carolina is a toss up and Florida should be a close one, but mitt might win it. Nevada's mitt's to lose.

OK.... I still say big freekin deal.

With all the cash Mittens had, he shouldve been up by 10-15%

Santorum is the man!  
 
 
The Romney Team will crush Santorum like it did Gingrich. Santorum is dead man walking.

Mitt Romney 27%

Ron Paul 5%
Rick Perry 4%
Michele Bachmann 4%
Jon Huntsman 1%

About a week old, but after Iowa and New hempshire wouldn't suprise me if that increases for mitt.

Santorum should be very pleased with that number. I am finding it unbelievable that he got that many votes. Newt is gonna be pissed.
 
 
Just more evidence that the GOP doesn't have a clear view of who they want for president.

Obama is gonna win.

Some thoughts.

Romney- Well, no matter where Romney placed tonight, his constituency in the MSM (until after he gets the nomination, anyway. See also John McCain) was going to declare it a victory for him. Really, though, he spent millions of dollars, had the whole of the GOP establishment behind him, had a huge organization, and he got a whole 8 votes more than a washed up ex-Senator who had the good fortune of being the last "not Romney" the base looked at. He got less of a percentage than he did in Iowa in 2008.

Santorum did well, and he's the "not Romney de jour for the moment. This just means that MSM hasn't gotten around to sliming him like they've slimed everyone else. He lacks the organization, but he might get a grassroots swell at this point. We'll see.

Ron Paul- Is not going to be the nominee.

Newt- Newt still has the resources to continue. South Carolina is his make or break state as he competes with Santorum to be the last "Not Romney" standing.

Rick Perry- Is apparently "reassessing" his campaign. Ah, if only you assessed your campaign before you started it, Ricky! If he drops out, that's a lot of Not Romney votes up for grabs.

Michelle Bachmann- Done, finished, stick a fork in her. She has to concentrate on winning her congressional seat.

Jon Huntsman- Never had any skin in the game in Iowa, so he's going to be waiting for NH. Romney's "win" (no, no, really, it's a win when 75% vote for someone else!) probably makes it harder for him to gain traction, so he's out after New Hampshire.

I think he and Perry went in under the same assumptions that happened to be wrong.

that

1) The base hates everyone currently running, and all they need is someone to hoist the Conservative banner.

2) And that once they get a candiate to follow, they'd do all the work for you.

3) Building a ground team doesn't matter all that much.

But at the end of the day, this is the Republican Party. And the establishment picks a candidate, the rest of us are supposed to fall in line.

Which is why they've lost 4 of the last five popular votes.

Probably because they don't have a voter ID law.

All he had to do was be a Bush clone in Texas. Bush was always stupid in debates too but he had wingnut support. Even Republicans are catching on that we need more than empty suits running things.

Romney, (slightly) better than the worst..
 
 
A rather dismal showing for Mitt, eh?

All that money and all that political suck, and still more than three out of four Iowans reject him.

Interesting race, this.

It shows us just how divided the GOP really is.

That's a funny thing about the wingnuts.

First they cheered Bush as being a REAL conservative in his defeat over "that RINO MCCain".

Now they try to pretend that he wasn't a REAL conservative.

They need to make up their minds.

I agree. What if Santorum has the same kind of dumb luck Bush had? We could end up with that idiot as president for 8 years.

What mess? Specifically.
 
 
Romneys strategy to take down Gingrich, the only candidate who could calmly out debate Obama was a politically dicey one. And an arrogant one. We can basically say Romney tied with with Santorum when Romney had all the advantages a candidate could have.

This just says that Romney is not a shoo in for the nomination by a long shot. Gingrich is still viable in South Carolina and Santorum will have the funds. Who does Romney aim his venom at now? He has the reputation for breaking the party apart which isn't good for this historic election.

He was expected to take New Hamshire away by big numbers and if he doesn't, it will have everyone talking about him being a loser. He has never come above mediocre numbers, or experienced a surge.
 
 
Wow 8 votes. I wonder if there was any fraud. I'm sure it won't make a difference.

Romney's in. Everything from this point on is just a cat fight. Interestingly enough..it will be wonderful material for Democrats.

To Republicans? Naw.

Notice they weren't checking any ID's.

This shouldnt come as a shock for anyone who knows a thing about Iowa. Your only shocked because of ignorance.

Cause the Dems had such a clear idea who they wanted for President this time in 2008. After 1 freaking caucus.

The media was always going to declare Romney the winner? Really?? Which is why despite the fact that he did win, they are saying he only won technically and didn't really win because Santorum has the story coming out of Iowa.

Yeah. The media is in a conspiracy to freaking pick Romney. Which is why they are saying the exactly same crap you are about him.

Clearly the GOP won the Presidency in 2008. Thats the only possible conclusion that can come from his assumptions.
 
 
I'm no political pundit (and I consider that fact to be among my better qualities), but it seems to me that Perry and Bachmann are about to exit, and their supporters are more likely to fall in line behind Santorum than Romney.

Santorum. Holy crap, I can't believe I just typed that name in reference to the GOP presidential nomination. Obama's the luckiest guy on the freakin' planet.

Yeah. He is. He's going to make millions on the speaking circuit next year. Tis a shame someone so corrupt can make so much money
 
 
As you say. Iowa is only one State.

Lets see what happens in NH, SC and Florida.

As I recall McCain was toast at this time in 2008

Should be interesting.
 
 
I have to get to work but any hypocritical right wingnut who can help shed some light on why they weren't checking IDs in Iowa would be greatly appreciated.

Oh, please, just because they are doing a narrative of the story and still have to acknowledge that winning by 8 votes after spending millions is pretty pathetic.

Until he wins the Nomination.

Of course. Let's go back and crash the economy and bail out wall street again. It was Bush's policies that brought this country to its knees. Never before has there been a tax cut, largely for the wealthy, accompanied by fighting two wars. That is how you spell disaster. Yeah, we need to relive that nightmare.

Palin would be almost too good to be true. Get this stuff out of the party's system for 2016.

2010 was actually not a bad year. Until people realized the implications of all Obama's new regulations and ObamaCare, and it tanked again in 2011.

That's why this has been a long recession. No one wants to hire if hiring is such a liability.

Most of them are too ignorant to know what happened.

Possibly a few of them know, but they don't care because they think that politics is a game like football and they're "team" players.

Time for Barry to pull up his big boy pants and take responsiblity for his own economy. I mean, seriously, the blaming Bush thing isn't going to work much longer, guy.

The only thing that saves the idiot is that the Republicans are so awful.
 
 
The implosion had been building for 60 years.
Nothing to do with the current fool that places his fanny in the White House.
He could fuck up a steel ball without trying.
Santorum is going no where. This race is over for him. The only votes he got in Iowa were the anti Romney votes, not sure about Romney votes, maybe Romney votes and hard core evangelical votes.
He may have 10% in the next 3 and is gone. I still call it a Romney Gingrich race.
Iowa means little if anything except it gives Romney speed.
 
 
Romney won the headlines today but the race was a three way tie in reality. The press deals in sensationalism not reality.

The delegate breakdown is as follows:
Romney, Sanatorium, Paul get 6, Gingrich 4, Perry 3. This could change change later as the process continues.

It takes 1144 delegates for nomination. If Romney continues to only get 25% of the delegates or even 40% he will not get a first ballot election as the nominee and the convention will become open to anyone to become the nominee. I think there may be some behind the scene mechanization's going on that could deliver that scenario.

Never before has there been a tax cut, largely for the wealthy, accompanied by fighting two wars. That is how you spell disaster. Yeah, we need to relive that nightmare.

 

You know what, I did really good during Bush. Made good money.

Yeah, things got hinky after the Democrats took congress, and business decided that the party was over.

 

SHIIIIIT!!!!!!

During Clinton's presidency my 401k was making more money than I was and during that 8 years my home tripled in value, AND we had a balanced federal budget.

Then Bush came in, gave out MASSIVE tax cuts and invaded Iraq FOR NO GOOD REASON. And then the economy went to HELL.

You guys can only wish Bush was even half as effective as Clinton.
 
 
 
 
I agree. What if Santorum has the same kind of dumb luck Bush had? We could end up with that idiot as president for 8 years.

 

As opposed to the idiot we have now?

I wish we could go back to the Bush days when we had 5% unemployment and the deficit was a mere 200 billion a year.

 

I'll bet you do.  

Take my ass back to the 90's. (see above)
 
 
Really lukewarm contest last night. Only 122K voters last night and 75% of them don't like Romney.
 
 
60% of the Santorum voters stated that abortion was their NUMBER ONE issue.
They are brain dead.
 
 
 
 
Wow 8 votes. I wonder if there was any fraud. I'm sure it won't make a difference.

 

To Republicans? Naw.

Notice they weren't checking any ID's.

 

 

It was a caucus; had to caucus in 2 places at once. When the polls are open for 12 hours, you can vote quite often.

I fully support voter ID rules as long as a free picture ID is made available to all who whish to cast ballots. Any charging for said ID is a poll tax and loses my support immediately.
 
 
 
60% of the Santorum voters stated that abortion was their NUMBER ONE issue.
They are brain dead.

 

Valuing life is hardly brain dead. Quite the opposite.

With 2 wars going on, Iran building a bomb and threatening us are you also claiming abortion is your number one issue?
If you are then you are brain dead also.
Valuing life has absolutely nothing to do with abortion views or the issues of the day.
I value life, oppose abortion yet know that abortion is a NON ISSUE.
You can not fix stupid.
Anyone that has abortion as their #1 national issue is a dumb ass uneducated moron.
 
 
It's a big win for Romney. Obviously i wish Ron Paul won but i wont rain on the man's parade. It's a nice win. Most thought he wouldn't win. So i'll just congratulate the man and move onto the next battle. New Hampshire here we come.
 
 
 
 
 
Just more evidence that the GOP doesn't have a clear view of who they want for president.

Obama is gonna win.

 

So, because Iowa was close, Obama is a lock, huh?  

 

Clearly the GOP won the Presidency in 2008. Thats the only possible conclusion that can come from his assumptions.

 

Actually, it's because your party is so divided that they can't get behind any single candidate, which is going to result in some GOP voters becoming so disgusted that they stay home.

The funniest thing is that the winner has had to face a desperate campaign to find someone else and numbers 2 and 3 have been completely ignored and written off by the commentators.
I think it shows a disconnection between the GOP and it's base which they should be worried about - they seem to have no idea what Republican voters want.

All the noise from the likes of the Tea Party (and fair play to them) has convinced the strategists, commentators and candidates that they need to move further right when this is actually moving them away from their true base.

Paul is toast.
Romney wins in NH and the Governor of South Carolina has endorsed him.
But southerners, we tend to be very independent and Humpty Dumpty will do very well in SC no matter what. With that, Santorum and Perry if he is still around will split the vote and SC voters may listen to their female Gov and vote for Romney.
But he is a Mormon and that prejudice still exists here.
So who knows but Romney is the nominee.

Why is it a "prejudice"?

Frankly, I never have understood why being critical of a belief system becomes off limits if you call it a "religion".

People who think Obama was born in Kenya are nuts.

People who think Bush blew up the World Trade Center are nuts.

People who think aliens from Zeta Reticuli are kidnapping Americans with the consent of our government are nuts.

People who think Joseph Smith was talking to God and God told him to have sex with those teenage girls are nuts.

Only one of those nutty belief system deserves "reverence" like race or ethnicity because they've managed to dress it up as a "religion" and put the silliness in a gilded book?
 
 
Anyone else notice...

Mitt won by ONLY 8 votes even though he spent 8 times the money the next guy spent.
122 THOUSAND people showed up. That's half the number that came out to vote FOR President Obama.
When the counting was done, 75% of those people did not vote for either Romney or Santorum.

Any way you look at it, that's a pretty grim picture for the pubs.

Mitt will probably be the candidate and that might a good thing for the country. He'll probably lose to the president which is a very good thing.

BUT, if the lies about Obama are successful and Mitt wins, he has always been for sale to Big Business and always will be - but so are all the other pubs. He won't bring anything to the WH with him because he is truly an empty suit. Under the Mitt regime, a full fledged recession is a sure thing but I think most people can see that.

I spose the funny part is that, while the rw's blame President Obama for everything from gas prices to their sister's pregnancy, they'll make every excuse imaginable for a pub prez cuz that's what the rw does.

Go ahead and do it all you want and I do not care. Does not bother me.

There's no "pre-judging" him at all. He's said straight up he's proud of his Mormon beliefs.

In 2008, he said he welcomed questions about his religion. Today the subject is off limits. Probably because a few people actually asked those questions in 2008.

If he really believes that ancient Hebrews built a vast civiization in America and he's going to rule his own planet in the afterlife, I think that would be as good a reason to reject him as irrational as if he believes he got an anal probe from a gray alien.

Ok, what questions do you have about his religion?
Where did he state any of that?
Many of us Christians do not believe the story of Noah and other stories in the Bible.
Again, where has he stated he believed what you just wrote?

Mormons don't have the right to Cherry Pick what they do and don't believe.

For instance, when I was a Catholic (until about age 21 or so), the nuns told us the story of Noah like it was true. God drowned those babies because they were "wiiiicked". By High School, the Christian Brothers admitted it was either a myth or an embellishment of a story about a real flood in Mesopotemia. I figured out it was bullshit,and got into trouble for questioning it even then.

But here's the key. The person who wrote that down wasn't engaging in fraud. He was writign down stories he heard and for all he knew, were true. Modern Christians can reject it as a myth and it doesn't take away one iota from their beliefs.

Joseph Smith doesn't get the same wiggle room. Either he was making stuff up, or he was really talking to God. And Mormons think he was really talking to God.

Mitt Romney is a Mormon. He thinks Joseph Smith was a prophet who talked to God. Forget about the overwealming proof Smith was a con man and a liar, or that his prophecies have all failed to come true. Or that things he claimed were holy writing (The Kinderhook Tablets, the Book of Abraham Papyrus) have been exposed as fakes.

Therefore, it is fair game for me to judge him based on what he believes.. and he doesn't get a pass because he dresses up these silly beliefs as "religion".

Also, honestly, Mormons I've encountered were snaky and really creeped me out.

You have 6603 posts about what I believe, and I've been more straightforward than Romney has.

More to the point, how can we know what Romney believes if he refuses to talk about it and the subject is "off limits"? Your whole premise is that he's just joshing us about really believing in Magic Underwear just like he was joshing those folks in Massachusetts when he said was all for abortion... Or maybe he's joshing people now when he says he's against abortion.

No, no and nope.
I could care less what any candidate says about abortion.
Abortion is a non issue. There will be no national amendment.

I think you missed my point.

An honest politician would say this... "You know what, we only have abortion because a lot of women are too stupid to control their own genitals. But as a pure practical matter, you will never be able to outlaw it, so it might as well be legal."

My problem with Romney is not what he actually believes, but apparently what his position is shifts according to who he's trying to patronize this week. He's a shifty character who tells you what he thinks you want to hear.

No, yes, all politicians do that to a certain degree, but Romney does that on Steroids.

Heck, I think that he'd probably renounce Mormonism if a pollster told him it was the only way he could win.
