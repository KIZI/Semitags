Late Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein planned an attack on the Prague-based, US-
funded station Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty in 2000, the Czech counter-
intelligence service BIS said Monday.

"Saddam Hussein ordered his secret service to violently disrupt Radio Free
Europe's broadcasting for Iraq, and earmarked substantial financial resources
for this operation," the BIS said in a report.

The station, which beams programmes to countries with restricted press freedom,
angered Saddam when it launched broadcasting for Iraq in 1998, four years after
it had moved to Prague from its Cold War-era base in Munich, Germany.

Iraqi secret service DGI monitored the station's building -- the former
Czechoslovak parliament on Prague's central Wenceslas Square -- from March 1999.

At the time, the BIS first noticed a "tourist wearing a dark jacket and a
woollen cap," taking pictures of the building.

A year later, a BIS source at the Iraqi embassy in Prague confirmed that Saddam
had ordered an attack.

The Czechs made a diplomatic protest at the end of 2000, but the Iraqi spies
kept monitoring the building, forcing Prague to expel the Iraqi consul who was a
DGI agent.

After the September 11, 2001 Al-Qaeda attacks in the United States, Czech
authorities built a barrier around the building and called in armoured vehicles
to guard the headquarters.

The BIS later learned that the DGI planned an attack from the window of a house
across the street.

After US-led forces attacked Iraq on March 20, 2003, Prague expelled another
four DGI agents at the Iraqi embassy, plus a diplomat, and assumed the case was
closed.

But a month later, after Saddam had been ousted, the BIS returned to the embassy
to collect 11 handguns, six submachine guns and an RPG-7 anti-tank missile.

This year the radio station -- which has more than 1,000 journalists and
correspondents, who broadcast in 28 languages and run a range of websites --
moved to a new supersafe building in Prague.

Saddam was captured in December 2003 and hanged three years later after an Iraqi
court convicted him of crimes against humanity.
