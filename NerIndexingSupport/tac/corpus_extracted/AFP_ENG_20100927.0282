Japan's leading microchip manufacturer Elpida Memory plans to establish a
research and development centre in Taiwan to beef up its alliance with local
partners, an official said Monday.

"We've been in talks with Elpida on the investment proposal," the official at
the economic ministry told AFP on condition of anonymity.

He said the project was part of Elpida's efforts to "strengthen cooperative
relationships with local partners."

The official would not provide details, but the Commercial Times said that if
realised, the investment proposal would cost Elpida up to three billion Taiwan
dollars (95.42 million US).

Elpida has either invested or maintained cooperative ties with three Taiwanese
firms -- ProMOS Technologies , Powerchip Semiconductor Corp. (PSC), and Elpida-
PSC joint venture Rexchip Electronics Corporation.

Elpida is the world's third largest maker of dynamic random access memory (DRAM)
chips used in mobile phones and home electronics.
