How Much Revenue will Government Gain from Tax the Rich?

How much additional revenue will the government collect from increasing taxes on those making over $1 million a year? On those making $250k a year?

Be sure to factor in some Laffer curve bias.

Will this additional revenue cover the government spending gap?

Can we give the rich incentives to pay higher taxes?

Hardly any. A progressive VAT tax would work, especially if applied to bank interest and fees, to get the country back on a solid footing but soaking the rich, dream on.
 
 
It is interesting how not one of the tax the rich democrats has a clue, yet they point fingers as they suck the country dry.
 
 
No amount of additional taxes or cuts in spending can fix the debt as we have crossed over the line.
With a 14 trillion dollar debt growing at the rate of over 4 billion a day and currently borrowing 40% of every dollar spent it is too late.
The current 38 billion that the GOP got cut from the budget was a joke. 38 billion is only 9.5 days of savings when there is a 4 billion a day increase in debt.
If we could cut the annual budget by 1 trillion a year we would still be adding to the debt and it is impossible to cut one trillion from annual spending. Get ready for this nation to default and become like a third world country as we lose our freedoms and rights and the military takes over to police the people who are living on the streets all because of irresponsible and corrupt politicians.
 
 
The truly wealthy never have any taxable income, so no tax increase will hit them. They have their wealth hidden in phony "charities" that they control. The only way to get them to pay their fair share of taxes is to end all charity deductions, and tax all "charities."

For example: The DuPonts had their house declared a historical site and then set up a "charity" to maintain the historical site. They packed the board with family members and required that the head of the board must be an immediate family member. They then donated the historical site to the foundation and specified that the head of the foundation lives in the house. They now get a tax deduction for the value of the house they live in and a tax deduction for their electricity, heat, etc. When the head of the foundation dies, the next family member becomes the head and lives in the house without paying a penny in inheritance taxes.

 Socialist Schakowsky Introduces Bill to Tax Millionaires and Billionaires 

 
The most popular way to reduce the deficit, according to 81% of Americans? Put a surtax on federal income taxes for those who make more than $1 million per year.-- NBC/Wall St. Journal Poll, March 2, 2011

The Fairness in Taxation Act asks enacts new tax brackets for income starting at $1 million and ends with a $1 billion bracket. The new brackets would be:

$1-10 million: 45%
$10-20 million: 46%
$20-100 million: 47%
$100 million to $1 billion: 48%
$1 billion and over: 49%
The bill would also tax capital gains and dividend income as ordinary income for those taxpayers with income over $1 million. If enacted in 2011, the Fairness in Taxation Act would raise more than $78 billion.
 
Lets see if I got this right. We are spending $1,345 Billion more than we take in each year, and the big soak the rich tax bill from a major socialist congresswomen may raise $78 Billion a year. Where the hell are we suppoed to get the other $1,267 Billion from???

Considering the Bush 2.4 trillion dollar tax cut that was passed through the same reconciliation that Republicans hate did nothing to help the country and more than 52% went to the top 1% and all of those that were millionaires and billionaires only saw their fortunes swell, I would say we could start there. That would bring back over a trillion dollars from people who never needed it in the first place.

This has no basis in simple math.
 
 
The solution isn't to TAX the rich.

The real solution is to refute the debts.

The nature of compounding interest makes that refutation of debt inevitable from time to time.

Generally that refutation of the debt happens when the organization (be it state or the monarch) either dismisses their debts or collapses and cannot pay them.

This is going to happen worldwide, sooner or later.

ACtually I susect sooner.

Spain and Portegal, and perhaps even this nation seem ripe for collapse.

If the deficit reduction established under Bush had continued until today, without the effect of the Obama Failed Stimulus, we'd be in surplus today.

As a failed economic plan, the Bush Tax Cuts are dwarfed by the Obama Failed Stimulus.

You got a lot of things right with this post. The wealthy have always been able to hire the best tax attornys to keep them from paying taxes. This is why raising taxes on the rich results in them circomventing the system. Daddy Bush 1 helped bring these tax free charities to the middle class with his "Thousand Points of Light" This was to help people fund tax free private education for their children with private charities. It has morfed into all kinds of crazy tax shelters. Most of this money is held in huge tax stock funds. Taxes on dividends was also reduced to spur more of this activity to fund private education, charities, fuel stock markets, economy & investment. The result is tax shelters allow the high income earners to pay smaller percent of their income as taxes than the low income earners.

Enron tought people how to use offshoreing & dummy foreign corporations to tax wash enormus sums of money. How do we keep the clever people from avoiding taxes while the IRS beats up on the lower & middle class?

STOP THE FUCKING SPENDING!!!!!!!!!!!!
 
and even if you pushed that up to 70% across the board lets say she gets 150 billion, hell, 200 billion........and? Now what.

you broaden the tax base, Ryan is on the right track, they have to do more on that but he has the right idea, you will never get more than the (average) 18.0% of the gdp, so you need to grow the pie, that is the gdp and the tax yield in DOLLARS grows not by % really.
 
 
From Heritage.com, talking about Obama's desire to extend the Bush 2003 tax cuts except for the top 2 levels of earners. It was written back in October 2010, and illustrates the tax increases would result in about $700 billion in more revenue over 10 years, but cost us in other ways. I suspect the claims of lost jobs and lower wages might be overstated (it's a conservative website), but I do think those things and the economy as a whole is adversely affected especially at a time like this when it isn't as robust as we'd like. I would also say that often the amount of increased revenues from a tax hike is overstated cuz rich guys find ways not to pay more taxes if you give 'em reasons to try.

" Obama’s current tax hike plan would raise the top two income tax rates from 33 and 35 percent to 36 and 39.6 percent, respectively. This tax hike will take effect on January 1, 2011, if he has his way and will slow the already badly struggling economy. This will keep unemployed Americans out of work longer and suppress the wages of those fortunate enough to retain their jobs. In fact, the higher tax rates Obama calls for will destroy an average of 800,000 jobs per year by the end of the decade and lower incomes by $720 billion [2] over that same period.

Over the next 10 years, the Obama tax hikes will take almost $700 billion from taxpayers. That is only 8 percent of the nearly $9 trillion President Obama’s budget adds in debt over that same period. Low tax revenues are not the cause of the debt explosion; spending is. The Obama budget raises spending to almost 25 percent of GDP—well above its historical average of 20 percent. Tax revenue will soon exceed its historical average of 18 percent of GDP. "

That would bring back over a trillion dollars from people who never needed it in the first place.
 
Let's just assume for the moment that your pie in the sky BS numbers are correct   $2.4 Trillion divided by Bush's 8 years = $300 Billion a year. The FY 2009 deficit = $1.413 Trillion so where do you get the additional $1.113 Trillion a year if you took away all the Bush tax cuts?  

Again I say: STOP THE FUCKING SPENDING!!!!!!!!!!!!
 
 
Here's a thought...tax all revenue exactly the same way.
 
 
 
Here's a thought...tax all revenue exactly the same way.
 
Tax all revenue? So if a business has $1 Million in revenue but $950,000 in costs you suggest that the tax be levied on $1 Million? I think you mean tax all income the same way. In that case...

How much money will that raise for the federal government? Remember that some of the money currently taxed at 15% is profit long term capital gains that currently makes a 5% ROI before tax and 4.25% after tax. If all income is taxed as income at the current 35%, then that means the after tax return would diminish to 3.25%.

Low margin businesses just wouldn't be worth the risk and that's a lot of restaurants, gas stations, and owner-operator mom & pop stores that would close. How would that affect government revenue?

Link to what? The Bush tax cuts? Is this a joke? You didn't know that Bush cut taxes to the tune of 2.4 trillion and more than 52% went to the top 1%? This is what everyone has been arguing about since Bush's first term.
 
 
We should tax the government unions & their members. Since they have money to blow on dues they can afford to pay their fair share. They only work 20 years & get paid for the rest of their life. When you add their benefits they are the rich.
 
 
So far the highest additional tax revenue proposed is $300 billion a year. That will barely make dent in our $1.4 Trillion annual deficit. The deficit is much to large to grow our way out of. We must cut government wages & spending. History proves that higher government wages & spending does not lower unemployment.

Joke's on you dude, get your facts straight before you jump on somebody else. The below is from cnn.money.com:

" Treasury estimates the costs of making the tax cuts permanent for everyone is $3.7 trillion over 10 years.

Of that, $3 trillion accounts for the cost of extending them for the vast majority of Americans, as the president has proposed. The remaining $700 billion is the cost of extending them permanently for the high-income earners. "
 
 
I think its stupid to tax the rich again. They are already paying most of the taxes in this country. Most of the so called"rich" are small business owners who creates jobs. Do you think if they put this in action that it will make the unemployment even worse. There are so many small business owners who gross over 250,000 but do not bring that home to their family. With Obama's plan this will destroy their business and many people will lose even more jobs..

Yes, as in taxes being called "revenue" to the government.

Tell ya what...I'll pretend that you're not an idiot if you do the same, okay?

A valid complaint.

 
Low margin businesses just wouldn't be worth the risk and that's a lot of restaurants, gas stations, and owner-operator mom & pop stores that would close. How would that affect government revenue?
 
No, actually this one is not relevant to the discussion, I think.

If anything, if all income was taxed the same SMALL businesses (real small businesses, not multimillion dollar a year corporations which fit in the insane SBA definition of small) would benefit from a FAIRER tax system where they weren't being expected to make up the difference that the investor class isn't paying

The people who would pay more are that class of investors whose revenue sources (AKA income for purposes of this discussion) would end up paying much higher rates of taxes than they currently do. No more "tax free" revenue bonds would exist for example.

A jump from 15% to whatever the highest rate of taxes would be would under those conditions be a staggeringly high increase in that class' RATE of taxation.
 
 
 
The truly wealthy never have any taxable income, so no tax increase will hit them. They have their wealth hidden in phony "charities" that they control. The only way to get them to pay their fair share of taxes is to end all charity deductions, and tax all "charities."

For example: The DuPonts had their house declared a historical site and then set up a "charity" to maintain the historical site. They packed the board with family members and required that the head of the board must be an immediate family member. They then donated the historical site to the foundation and specified that the head of the foundation lives in the house. They now get a tax deduction for the value of the house they live in and a tax deduction for their electricity, heat, etc. When the head of the foundation dies, the next family member becomes the head and lives in the house without paying a penny in inheritance taxes.

I love how CON$ can RATIONALIZE anything.

I said tax ALL charities and you singled out the Black churches, and that becomes I focus on ONE group and you focused on all of them.  
 
 
 
... How about everyone pay their fair share. IMO everyone should pay the same % of what they make.
 
"Fairness" is nice but it's just a great place to start arguments and get no where. In the meantime the state must survive and must get money. Us rich guys have more money so we get taxed more, so right or wrong that's what is. Besides the fact we got more money, there's a lot to be said for having us rich pay a bigger percentage because an extra ten percent cut for me won't change my eating habits like that kind of hike would do to my kids.

That said, the fact remains that this 'rich-taxing' bit is a good idea that's gone too far and we're at a place where more tax hikes will just further reduce revenue.
 
 
 
The truly wealthy never have any taxable income, so no tax increase will hit them. They have their wealth hidden in phony "charities" that they control. The only way to get them to pay their fair share of taxes is to end all charity deductions, and tax all "charities."

For example: The DuPonts had their house declared a historical site and then set up a "charity" to maintain the historical site. They packed the board with family members and required that the head of the board must be an immediate family member. They then donated the historical site to the foundation and specified that the head of the foundation lives in the house. They now get a tax deduction for the value of the house they live in and a tax deduction for their electricity, heat, etc. When the head of the foundation dies, the next family member becomes the head and lives in the house without paying a penny in inheritance taxes.

CALLER: And, you know, and the way our tax system works, we have an overly complex system, which in and of itself is a problem, but the way our tax system works and the way the tax laws are written, it's based on a few kind of like hinge numbers like adjusted gross income and taxable income, and while the soak the rich -- or however you choose to describe it -- really doesn't come down that way. It really comes down to much lower income levels.

RUSH: It does, exactly, and here's the dirty little secret if you ever to pull it off. It's hard. This is why most people don't understand the tax-the-rich business. You've got to structure your life so you have no "earned" income. I'm out of time. I'll explain that. There's a category called earned income versus other kinds of income. Earned income is what the income tax rate is on. That's how "the rich" do it. They don't have "earned" income.

The Truth About Taxes
August 6, 2007
RUSH: I've told you before: the income tax is designed to keep people like his [Buffett's] secretary from becoming wealthy! There is no "wealth" tax. So this is a big misnomer....
But there's no tax on wealth. There is a tax on income, and the tax on income is designed to keep everybody who is not wealthy from getting there.

I'm talking about genuine wealth, not the way Democrats define "rich."
 
We would have to start taxing charities & life insurance. The rich donate to charities who buy a life insurance policy on the donor. The donor barrows against this life insurance to live on tax free until he dies. The the insurance pays off the loans. The rich avoid inheritance taxes & income taxes this way.
 
 
 100 Percent Tax on Those Earning $500K or More Leaves U.S. With $839B Deficit 

 
After taxing away 100 percent of the income of those earning $500,000 or more in 2009, the Obama administration would still have needed to increase taxes on Americans earning less than $500,000 by a total of $839 billion--just to balance federal accounts for the year.
 
Do you think we have a spending problem or what? Yes we do need to actually collect more taxes from the rich who escape taxes through loopholes in tax laws.

Of, of course, stats like that are intended for suckers. Most of the wealth of incomes over $500,000 does not show up as AGI, which does not include unrealized capital gains. What I found interesting was that 3% of the over $500,000 group had NO TAXABLE INCOME!!!!!
 
 
 
... we do need to actually collect more taxes from the rich who escape taxes through loopholes in tax laws.
 
'Fraud-waste-and-abuse' comes up when nobody wants to get anything done. At one time the story was we had enough of FW&A to pay for Obamacare, but now there's not enough of it to bring down the deficit without more tax-hikes. So let's get specific and see what worked before with increasing government revenue. Budget totals from the GPO have revenue increasing when tax rates were cut:

Year__Receipts(in millions of dollars)
2000 2,025,191
2001 1,991,082
2002 1,853,136
2003 1,782,314

(tax-rate cuts)

2004 1,880,114
2005 2,153,611
2006 2,406,869
2007 2,567,985
2008 2,523,991
2009 2,104,989
2010 2,162,724

Your link had this sub link, "However,  recently released statistics  from the Internal Revenue Service" which is where I found that amount in column 54.

Thanks. I clicked that before but did not realize all the info scrolling to the right.

It is an eye opener. Looking at the change in "Tax as a percentage of AGI" from 2001 to 2007 the largest percentage drop is in the highest income earners. They did recover some in 2008 & 2009. I guess the Rich really did get a bigger percent tax break.

Which means we need to overhaul our tax code or go to a flat tax with no deductions, loopholes, or credits. Or at least put a ceiling on deductions and clamp down on the req'ts for tax exempt foundations.

From that source it only shows that 0.5% over $500,000 had no taxable income. You probably added all the 0.5% income categories together but forgot to divide by the number of income categories.

It also shows people with No adjusted gross income paying $10,594 to $18,744.

You are misreading the chart. Column A shows the range of income for each category, so you must add ALL the categories from $500,000 on up together to get the total % of people earning over $500,000 who show no taxable income.

That is not correct. If they had 200 income categories above $500,000 it would total 100% show no taxable income. Clearly you must average the income brackets & not add them.

Again you show your ignorance of where the wealth truly exists. The real wealth exists in capital assets which do not show up on a taxable income chart. Capital assets are NOT taxable until they are sold, and if Lyin' Ryan gets his way, they will never be taxed even after being sold!!!!!!!

True, a glance at the graph gives the impression that the middle class pays everything, what with the bell shaped curve bold faced class warfare title. However a closer look at the numbers shows that most taxable income is from AGI's over $200k, and that's the highest of the top 5% of filers. So even these data hand picked from somewhere in the IRS show that us rich are paying the bills around here.

Your welcome.

I am sorry the education has failed you. Inventing facts does not help anyones argument.
 
 
 
 
 
Link?
 
Link to what? The Bush tax cuts? Is this a joke? You didn't know that Bush cut taxes to the tune of 2.4 trillion and more than 52% went to the top 1%? This is what everyone has been arguing about since Bush's first term.
 

Joke's on you dude, get your facts straight before you jump on somebody else. The below is from cnn.money.com:

" Treasury estimates the costs of making the tax cuts permanent for everyone is $3.7 trillion over 10 years.

Of that, $3 trillion accounts for the cost of extending them for the vast majority of Americans, as the president has proposed. The remaining $700 billion is the cost of extending them permanently for the high-income earners. "

In typical CON$ervative fashion, when completely wrong stoop to condescension.

To get the TOTAL over $500,000 you ADD all the income levels in the column from $500,000 on up, just as the original article did to get the $1+ trillion TOTAL of all the income of earners over $500,000.
