Northeastern forced to settle for second in CAA

NU50GMU48

FAIRFAX, Va. - After wrapping up its regular season yesterday
with a
stirring 50-48 victory at George Mason, the Northeastern men's
basketball
team conveyed its well wishes to Virginia Commonwealth with a
postgame
chant of "V-C-U! V-C-U! V-C-U!"

The Huskies filled the visitors' locker room at the Patriot
Center with
the cheer in the hopes of reaching the Rams' ears in Norfolk, some
3?
hours southeast of here, where VCU played its regular-season finale
at Old
Dominion.

By snapping a three-game losing streak with their first victory
in five
visits to this cavernous building, where a crowd of 8,940 watched
George
Mason lose its third straight at home for the third time under
coach Jim
Larranaga, the Huskies were guaranteed of finishing no worse than
second in
the Colonial Athletic Association.

"To win at a place where not too many teams walk off the court
with a
victory," said NU coach Bill Coen, "really says something about
this
basketball team and what they're capable of."

After losing control of its destiny with a 73-62 loss to Hofstra
Tuesday
night at Matthews Arena, NU wrested victory away from the Patriots
with an
8-2 run in the final 35 seconds to put itself in position to win
its first
CAA regular-season title and claim the No. 1 seed in the conference
tournament next weekend in Richmond.

VCU, however, failed to come through, suffering a 73-70 loss
that enabled
Old Dominion (23-8, 15-3) to clinch the title and the top seed,
leaving NU
(19-11, 14-4) with the No. 2 seed and a 6 p.m. date Saturday
against the
winner of the Nos. 7-10 game.

Junior guard Chaisson Allen, who had a baseline 3-pointer rattle
in and out
with the Huskies trailing by 4 with 38.7 seconds left, capped NU's
amazing
turnabout when he made the first two of three foul shots after
hoisting a
trey with 0.5 seconds left on which he was fouled by Ryan Pearson.

Needing to make just one, Allen sealed the verdict on his first
attempt.

"I've been in that position before against Wright State," said
Allen (10
points, 7 rebounds, 2 assists), referring to the winning half-court
heave
he made with time winding down to lift the Huskies to a 70-67
victory Nov.
28. But when asked if he was surprised he got the controversial
call
against Pearson, who had made a pair of foul shots that gave the
Patriots a
48-45 lead with 33 seconds to go, Allen replied, "I was surprised
he even
tried to contest it, but I felt him on my side. I don't know, he's
probably
going to get an earful from Larranaga."

Allen found himself on the line when he made a long defensive
rebound off a
missed dunk by Mike Morrison (8 points, 12 rebounds) with 3.5
seconds left,
pushed the ball upcourt, figuring to take the last shot, and let go
of a
3-point heave. It was the last in three amazing plays by the
Huskies in the
final 35 seconds, beginning with a foul-inducing drive by freshman
Joel
Smith that pulled the Huskies within 46-45.

After Pearson went to the line for a pair (courtesy Nkem
Ojougboh's second
personal) that gave the Patriots a 48-45 lead, Matt Janning
(game-high 18
points on 8-for-19 shooting) followed with a trey from near
midcourt that
tied it with 23.9 seconds left, thus setting the stage for one last
defensive stop and Allen's heroics.

"It was a tribute to those guys who didn't stop believing and
continued to
compete in a competitive atmosphere," Coen said. "So to come away
with
the victory, we couldn't be happier."
