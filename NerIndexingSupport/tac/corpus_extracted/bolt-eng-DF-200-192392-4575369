Since when did being a burberry model make you famous?

Few models, very famous football manager and his family. Oh and come to think about it when we visited his ex wife she was with a famous american artist who drew me a portrait (I didn't know he was famous). They're just people no need to buy into the whole fame thing, aside from the models who can be a bit uptight

She's related to my partner, (distantly I think), the story isn't great, just went to a family party with my gf, and saw her, I'm socially awkward as hell so tried to avoid conversations with her and other people, but ended up having a conversation, and she was really sweet and lovely so yeah

I went to an S Club 7 concert for my sister's 11th bday when I was 9, but we sat right at the back of the place where the concert was held so they were only like dots to me the whole time!

I also met a photographer who takes photos for Vanity Fair, BMW/watch advertisements and CD covers and had some photos taken in his studio

I've been out to lunch with the band, 'The Enemy' (no joke, swear on my life. Tried giving the bass player Andy a flump and he wouldn't have it as they make him 'bloated.' It was very awkward and the majority of our conversations were about The Apprentice and supermarket self service checkouts... Played the Gretsch guitar from 'No Time For Tears' video.

My friend is best mates with Howard from Take That and good mates with Liam Gallagher. He's the same guy that enabled me to go out to lunch with The Enemy..

One of my friends reached the semi-finals of Britain's Best Dish and there's a girl in my year who's a Storm Model although I've never spoken to her.
 
 
the funny thing is that every famous person in the world will actually, like any human being, have a fair few best friends/close contacts...so many so that considering the amount of proper celebrities you could reasonably expect a fair few such people to have actually seen this thread!

yet DESPITE THIS the only responses you can see are people who ''once had a conversation with'' ''ran into'' ''auntie once met'' or ''best mates third cousins dog's owners' accoutant is...''

which basically proves that the real acquaintances of famous people dont go bragging about it on forums
 
 
I also know someone who was in the sun today hahahaha and she was on trisha!

Not technically a friend of mine, but I was once babysat by Jonathan Edwards (Olympic triple jump gold medallist in 2000 and still the current world record holder).

His father was vicar of the church my parents attended so my parents were friends of his family. Does that count?

Also one of my close friends went out with Nicola Benedetti for a couple of months. Was so weird being invited out for a drink, him saying he was bringing his girlfriend, Nicola. Spent the entire evening trying to work out who it was she reminded me of. It was only later that it hit me and I was like WTF!

Not really friends with anyone famous but I have met the Queen (awkward as hell   ), Stephen Fry (autograph), Nicolas Sarkozy (   ), Daniel Auteuil and Gérard Depardieu (both of whom I have autographs from   ) also I have met the Disney characters at Disneyland Paris   (I know they are fake but still was pretty cool when I was 7   ).
 
 
I know a royal person! He's like...a minor sheik in Kuwait!

I also know a guy who claims that he befriended the 'Duke of Luxembourg' while he was doing post-grad work at Brunel.

Which makes me his friend by association!

You probably bumped into them or stalked them or something...

I saw brian bello at stanmore station lol

 

Brian Bello lives near me, never met him but I often see him out and about lol  

I'm not friends personally, but I've met a few semi-famous people...

I'm friends with a british comedian's (don't want to namedrop) daughter, though I haven't seen her in a long time coz of uni  

Also my friend is friends with Russell Kane and his wife, he played guitar at their wedding

My best friend from childhood's current best friend is an actress, she used to be on the west end as a kid, then she was in some Disney programme and in then went bck to stage in Quadrophenia and is now in a band

Girl from Hollyoaks went to my school, her sis was on Stars in their Eyes kids. I was friends with their uncle who went to the school next door.

Anddd ummmm my dad had a few well known acquantainces (most famous probably Amy Winehouse before she became famous and Pete Doherty) when he lived in Camden, but has lived in Berlin for quite a few years now. I never met any of these people though. - LIES, I was offered guitar lessons by Jarvis Cocker's guitarist, but I don't even know his name so I don't think he counts as famous  

OH, and I know this beautiful little dog    http://www.positivenation.co.uk/issu...s/100_9940.jpg 
(She's on Google, that mean's she's famous)

ONE LAST ONE. My friend's brother is in Friendly Fires. And another friend's brother was in Ideal. OH Ashley Banjo from Diversity! Went to my college, good friends with one of my good friends. Various x-factor contestants, Rachel Adedeji, Stacey Solomon, Matt Cardle. All friends of freinds, but none of them are actually my friends

Okay, I thought of ANOTHER tenuous link - half the cast of TOWIE  

And I used to know the dude who did the Moon Chavs song if anyone knows it   apparently his brother is Beardyman, only just learned that the other week

I'm going away now, promise.

I don't hate France. I love Spiral3 on BBC4.

How did you manage to meet the Queen? Did you shave your legs before meeting her?

Don't like Sarkozy much- he come across as a short man who thinks big. :/
 
 
My grandma taught Dermot O'Leary at primary school?

I went to school with one guy, and he's the first black burberry model

 

i know 2 lads who are competing in the london 2012 youth, if not actual olympics and 1 more who might be
a girl in the year below me at school is a model for fred perry.
ma dad has been all over the world and is on 'friend' terms with loads of famous people in the racing industry (telephone numbers in his diary sorta thing) he also once met the owners of real madrid fc
my dad also taught adam tanner an ex pro footballer, said he was marvelous and could do anything on the pitch, shame he wasted himself on booze and drugs though
 
 
 
Hahahahahha, would YOU ring a primary school teacher if you were famous?

 

I might do.   loooool.

He is on radio2 on Saturdays. She could ring him and say "I was your teacher...".
 
 
 
I don't hate France.
Sure.
How did you manage to meet the Queen?
There was this thing that happened in the SW where she had a tour of a couple of areas, it happened to go through mine, I was in the crowd she shook my hand... kinda lame tbh but I still met her.
Did you shave your legs before meeting her?
No, it is only for swimming... want to be aerodynamic.
Don't like Sarkozy much- he come across as a short man who thinks big. :/
Meh.

 

In bold.
 
 
I knew Stuart Cable (before he died obviously) used to see him in the pub rather a lot and he talked to my step dad a lot. Also one of my old school friends plays for a Welsh football team I forget which though
 
 
 
In bold.

 

I really don't hate France. I am sorry if come across as so. I like France.

At least you shook her hand- not something to forget. I would feel quite the same if it happened to me.
 
 
 
I used to sit next to the best female under-18 fencer (don't remember which weapon) in the Asia Pacific region for GCSE art. Not exactly famous, but pretty damn cool.

 

I think I've met her oddly. She was at last year's Invicta Open. I fence with 3 times world champion and 1 time Olympic champion, Ralph Johnson

Also, my dad's god son is the grandnephew of Dame Judy Dench. Does that count?
 
 
 
Emma Watson's brother- look him up, he's kinda famous now too  

Okay, we were friends like 4 years ago, but I still count it. He had a crush on me  

 

Omg they look a like!  
 
 
I went to school with a guy who plays for Dunfermline Athletic FC. He was a prick.

Met loads of other (Scottish) football players, they constantly seem to come into my work or we bump into them in clubs.

I also used to frequently serve Gordon Brown's wife at my old work when they were home.
 
 
my dads business partner's dad (who he was friends with) owned the house in Birmingham UB40 rented. He had to kick them out though because they had a studio in there and blasted music all night lol. Saw chris o dowd (rory of the IT crowd) coming through knock airport and a couple of girls in my class talked to Ashley Tisdale on chat roulette (NO JOKE) god knows why they were on it. Girl in the year below is cousins with Ellie Goulding.
 
 
 
someone doesn't have any friends.

 

it's not about having friends, its just an observation i made. statistically there must be many people who read this thread with moviestar/music star whatever friends...yet all we get is really tenous stuff about bumping into people. just an observation,nowt to do with having friends

the best i could claim is that my dad is friends with founder of the biggest pub chain in the country (yes its the one you are probably thinking of) and my housemate is the cousin of a big indian sportstar (who if u are indian you will have heard of)

or if i wanted to be a real hanger on like many on thsi thread, i could bring up that i have ex classmate in formula 3 and one who is the actual main model for burberry (one all over their homepage, not the ''first black model''op said lmao). have both on fb. wow look at me

it's just interesting. the "small world theory" states that you can link anyone to anyone in 6 links, so it's interesting finding out about people you know that are closer in.

I don't feel special at all. I'm actually related (by marriage tbf) to a VERY famous footballer who died. theres a TV programme about him about to air on TV (called United). That doesn't make me feel cool, it's just cool to other people sometimes.
 
 
one of my cousins is good friends with Amir Khan so i've meet him a few times
 
 
 
What band are you in?
I'm thinking of going to Cornbury as it's pretty local.

 

I'm in "Jamie and the giant peach" (bassist is called jamie), we should be on the riverside stage on friday or saturday I think! Come along  
 
 
I don't personally know any famous people but my friend is Catherine Zeta Jones' second cousin and was flower girl at her wedding.

oh right i think i know who you are talking about actually. i'm not meaning to diss people for talking about minor links, i was more focussing my observation on the fact that those who are really really close to really famous stars are always the ones who abstain from the discussion, but i suppose u would...it would be no different to me naming my best mate on an internet forum...spose thats why there are no such posts.
 
 
I've met the previous french president Jacques Chirac and the queen(who has a very firm handshake, the president, not the queen)
Minty from Eastenders goes to my local chip shop and I've conversed with him about his Porsche, I've worked with this dude  
He was a director for a film that I appeared as an extra in. I've met Rick Ross, and my mum used to babysit for Reggie Yates when he was younger  
Perks to living in camden  
 
 
I've known the odd person on the fringes. Family members of those who are famous or mates of famous people. Judging by my experience, they are quite fake and annoying, and probably the type of people who are superficial and users. But to be fair, that was the type who were desparate to be in it, and not for doing something of substance so much.
