Japan's Mitsubishi Motors Corp. said Thursday it remained in the red in the
fiscal first quarter as the global economic slump battered demand, but said it
expected to return to profit this year.

Japan's fourth-largest automaker posted a net loss of 26.4 billion yen (278
million dollars) for the April-June period, against a year-earlier profit of
10.3 billion yen, a company statement said.

Cost cuts failed to return the company to the black after a big loss in the year
to March, as a stronger yen and plunging sales ate into profitability.

Revenue more than halved to 259.1 billion yen from 610.1 billion, saddling the
company with an operating loss of 29.6 billion yen, compared with a profit of
9.9 billion yen a year earlier.

"Repercussions from the financial crisis are continuing but compared to before
they are generally abating," said Kazuya Matsushita, a senior financial official
at the automaker.

Global sales tumbled 32 percent to about 213,000 vehicles due to weaker demand
in key markets such as North America, Europe and Japan, but also in Asia, the
company said.

Sales increased in China and the Philippines, but overall demand declined in
Asia, a region on which Japanese makers are pinning most of their recovery
hopes.

Despite the lacklustre results, the maker of the Pajero SUV kept its annual
forecast unchanged from April, predicting a net profit of five billion yen and
operating profit of 30 billion yen.

The carmaker said it will raise about 75 billion yen beginning Friday through
syndicated loans from 29 banks for investment in new vehicles.

"We expect that we will be able to procure the necessary funds for operations,"
said Matsushita.

Last month MMC rolled out the electric "i-MiEV" minicar as it seeks to capture a
slice of the fast-growing market for environmentally friendly cars and take a
lead in zero emission vehicles.

Japanese automakers have taken a beating from the global financial crisis, but
have said they see glimmers of hope for a recovery thanks to government
incentives and growing popularity of fuel-efficient cars.

Honda Motor Corp on Wednesday said net profit dived 95.6 percent in the April-
June period while rival Nissan, which is axing 20,000 jobs to cope with the
global economic crisis, logged a net loss of 16.53 billion yen.
