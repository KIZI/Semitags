 
 
Which country has the most beautiful women?
 
 
I dont just mean physical beauty... but intelligence aswell......

Officially it is India and Venezuela.......

But what do you guys think?

These are the countries which have won ther most miss world and miss universe titles combined.....

1 Venezuela
2 India
3 Sweden
4 Puerto Rico
5 Netherlands
5 Finland
6 Trinidad and Tobago
7 Brazil
8 South Africa
 
 
I would say Pakistan or Iran, the only reason they aren't in the offical list is cos Pakistan doesn't "allow" it........

Hmmm but Brazil has the sexiest footy fans......

But for both beauty and intelligence it has to go to India no doubt  
 
 
Out of the countries I've been to, I'll have to say the Czech Republic. I loved walking around Prague.

At the bottom of the list, I'll put Ireland...
 
 
Eastern Europeans like Russians, Estonia, Lithunia, Latvia and also Italians i think.
 
 
I'd say Brazil or India.

What about Turkey? Azra Akin won Miss World in 2002.....and she was beautiful!
 
 
Brazilians and Italians....the Spanish have some gorgeous girls aswel.
 
 
Brazil have beautiful women...... but for beauty and intelligence.... it defo goes to india!

Just look at some of the girls:

They are indeed very beautiful....especially Aishwarya. Not so much could be said about Indian men though

In answer to the topic - I'd have to say its India  

I'm from North India (Punjab to be precise!)... I'v got dark brown hair and grey eyes with a medium complexion...but I still look Indian and have never been told otherwise, but I have seen a lot of girls who have VERY light skin, hair and eyes...
 
 
WOO!! Cmon India!
I wish I looked like the Miss World Girls...

But I think Latino women are really pretty.
 
 
i reckon latin american girls.

but they're quite loose. which might also be good haha.

i want to look like a miss world tooo  
 
 
tbh you're not far off db
 
 
spain brazil puerto rico
 
 
Lots of models seem to come from Russia too...
 
 
Is Essex a country?
 
 
Of all the countries i've been too (and there are a fair few that i have) i'd have to say israel! (i spose it's a middle eastern thing, which i why those hotties from lebanon are SO...hot! lol)

Seriously, mind-blowingly gorgeous, perfectly formed, beautiful AMAZING women! (natalie portman for a start!)

WOOOOW! yumm....
 
 
Egypt, Lebanon, Brazil, Western Europe, Scandinavia, south asia
 
 
India for women but I hate Indian men, cant stand them.
 
 
um..Probably Jordan or Brazil...oooo and arab countries have loads of beautiful women
 
 
no all this judging is stupid
 
 
Well I'm quite sure I've read some "research" on this; most people seem to say that Sweden and Finland have the most beautiful women, and as I've been traveling alot I must agree, the average Swedish chick is ****ing gorgeous!
 
 
Arabic countries have beautiful women, so does Pakistan, India as well...but i went to India last year..and majority of women look NOTHING like the Bollywood actresses....Aish is sooo beautiful, but she doesn't look indian at all.
 
 
If we're speaking on huge general terms, then I'd go with India and Italy. But because there are so many girls who are stunning in so many different countries, it doesn't feel right generalising in such a huge way   maybe that's just me! I'd only go for India and Italy because I think girls with dark hair and dark eyes are really pretty!  
 
 
i like nordic girls
any scandinavian country

AHAHA that's not what you said yesterday  
i jokee.

i prefer girls with dark features with pale skin. they're too blonde for me over there haha
 
 
India, definitely  
 
 
Persian women are by far the most beautiful. It's the eyes that do it;they're HUGE and multi-coloured.
 
 
What a weird thread. In every population there are pretty people and ugly people, its not as if all the beautiful people are in one country and the next country along is full of mingers.

obviously.

i'm guessing the thread is about personal preference. correct me if i'm wrong. some races have features that people find preferable which other races don't have.
 
 
Then why dont they rename it to: Which race has the most beautiful women? A lot of countries now being ethnically diverse and all

Iranian women are miles better looking than Arabic women.

Aish doen't look as glamorous in real life but don't get me wrong shes still really beautiful!
 
 
Middle Eastern women for me... Both Arab girls and Persian girls are hott
 
 
I dont think the miss world thing is a good way to look at it because its not looking at much of the population. The girls from india on the first page on this thread where hot though dont look like i would typicaly have expected them to.

I have seen some very hot girls in Israel, i went to corfu and they where all english (not that english is bad) in france they where decent aswell. Have not been anywhere else, theres the sterotype of brasil italy and spain never actualy been there though.

She is beautiful  
 
 
I'd say Malay/Arab/Turkish girls in general. #kiss#
 
 
definatly pakistan, especially the punjabi girls there super hot, then next comes iran which has gorgous persian chicks and the afgan girls are good is well.

Yes! Somebody who is on my wavelength  
 
 
Some of you might get offended about what I have to say, but I have been all around the world, seen tons and tons of beautiful woman and I can honestly say, without any hesitation that the girls at home (the US) beat everyone out there.

Yeah, nations like Brasil, Russia, China, etc... have good looking women, but I need a girl that takes a shower every day. I need a girl that shaves her legs, her armpits, and wears deodorant. I need a girl that smells good, that looks good, that has nice teeth... etc...

Yeah, people might argue that a lot of girls in the states are overweight, but not the girls that I date. Just my opinion... but cleanliness and personal hygiene go a long way.
 
 
I really do not find alot of miss world/miss universe contestants very attractive...it's all makeup and fakeness to me.

As far as most beautiful women go. I agree with whoever said Eastern Europeans, but also the Japanese, Spanish, Italians, French...i really can't choose. Some English women too, I mean we do have our beauties despite the many beasts you see. Brazilian, any country that is responsible for the likes of Adriana Lima needs some credit.

I'm not one to agree with the majority who have said Indian, I don't know why, they just don't appeal to me and I didn't find any girls on the front page attractive at all. I guess thats down to the personal preference and features somebody mentioned.

I'm sorry but are you stating girls elsewhere lack in personal hygiene? I think thats incredibly unfair and of course its offensive.
The girls in America, but which of those girls are most attractive, they must have descended from somewhere else...the amount of mixes in america is enormous.

Which actually makes me think, girls from one country are nice, but mixed race girls are generally pretty hot.

Not everyone has the same personal hygiene. It some places people take a shower 2 times a week- others take one 10 times a week. Some people don’t brush their teeth that often, others do 3 times a day. I’ve lived in China, Russia, and spent a great deal of time just backpacking abroad. During that time I’ve hooked up with a good number of girls overseas. Yeah, these girls might be good looking, but their hygiene seriously lacks to the girls in the states.

I think East European women are beautiful (hungry wolf look), as well as some American girls (strong, sporty look), and French women (pale, dishevelled look). I don't think Italians/Spaniards/Brazilians are anything special once you get past the whole dark thing, and also they have a tendency to get majorly ugly once they get married for some reason.

Also, as to English/Scottish/Irish women - the problem is so many insist on caking on thick layers of uneven fake tan, and bleaching and straightening their hair to no end. If they just left themselves alone, then I think the English rose or Celtic look is very pretty (pale, freckles, light eyes).

Right on there
 
 
All women are beautiful woot woot! but i think natural beauty is best!
 
 
what bull**** rave_on
 
 
reminds me of a quote i heard, im not going to pass judgement on the levle of truth in it or not, but its a really cool quote.

"you do not love a women because she is beautyfull, she is beautyfull because you lover her"
 
 
I think Japanese women are really beautiful, they tend to have really soft. neat and symmetrical features.
Swedish/Finnish people tend to have that too and pale skin and hair, I like that. Same for the men of those countries

Well when I searched "Denmark Women" and "Iceland Women", this is what I got:

Denmark:

 

Iceland:

 

Is that what you call beautiful?  
 
 
Ok maybe that was harsh on the Iceland one, here's the best one I could find on google images:

 

Sorry couldn't find a better one for the Denmark one.

You make the most sense in this thread.
 
 
Each Country had beautiful Women throughout the World.End of.
 
 
I've found part lebanese or israeli women to be extremely gorgeous.

I love Brazilan girls too.

I met a half lebanese half brazilian girl last month who was awesome.

India was part of the Persian Empire...so if they have Pakistani relations then they have Indian relations also...its common sense.
 
 
Russia
 
 
i think it goes to INDIA and the LATIN Countries..Most of the girls r gorgeous!!!
no offense though

Puerto Rico and India have some beautiful women from there.

You can't judge by a country's celebrities - they're a tiny proportion of the elite, and therefore don't represent the country as a whole.
 
 
But the person whom I quoted was generalizing Indian men. So I don't see why I can't specify a certain group of them.
 
 
Russia without a doubt  
 
 
beauty changes depending on your culture..so what may be beautiful for me is probably not for someone in france or any other country so really it depends on each person's point of view  
 
 
but another thing to consider is that when im in the airport in Saint Petersburg and watch the beautifull girls..they all seem to be on flights towards Paris  .

ps ive also been to Germany, France, USA, Iceland Belgium and Argentina (and others i dont rember) in terms of comparing lol (obviously didnt go there for those reasons).

Everything about this thread is ridiculous. Alot of people on here obuiously think that a certain look equates to beauty and that anything outside of these categorise does not qualify.

Im going to say England has the most beautiful women, particularly its capital. Nowhere else in the world can you take a 30 minute journey and encounter women of so many different races. Unfortunetly countries some of you have listed like india and russia for example havent experienced such a great amount of migration. So I think their varities in different looks is somewhat limited.
 
 
Arabic/Middle Eastern (especially Lebanese)
Italian
Brazillian (that booty is so powerful it makes me cry)
Latin America

Oh, but she didn't even name the best looking ones, like Hrithik Roshan, Aamir Khan, or the sexiest man alive...Saif Ali Khan.

Saif
 

Aamir
 

Hrithik
 

And I also think that there are Hindi actresses that are much prettier than Ash, like Urmila Matondkar, Preity Zinta, Soha Ali Khan, Rani Mukherji, or Priyanka Chopra.
 
 
lol india definately.
milli-hey i aint that bad-looking, but i have a sexy name! Rahul, i guess it makes up for the bad looks i have. indian men are not that bad milli. i hope you haven't been eyeing up the rickshaw wale in Delhi!!!
how come you put hrithik as a good looking guy, come on he looks like a monkey and has a wierd nose. but if you looking for beauty in bollywood for actors then shahrukh and amitabh are the best because they are also very intelligent.
i have to agree priyanka, rani, urmila, shilpa, preity, kajol, amrita rao are sooooooooo nice and yeah better than ash!
 
 
Definatelly the Czech Republic!!;-)...Not only do they have this year's Miss World, but generally the girls there are very pretty

 http://babe-fun.blogspot.com/2006/10...kucharova.html 
 
 
Sweden without doubt. You cannot argue on this and I declare this thread closed.

wtf? sweden may have nice girls but you can't beat the bollywood babes! thread remains open!
 
 
i would have to say somewhere like Australia or the US has the best looking women. You get a range of the races which is always good, but the average white american or australian girl is infinitely better looking than the average white british girl. (i'm not talking about the stereotype of the obese texan or the anorexican californian barbie, but the average girl you see walking down the street...athletic bodies, good grooming, lovely hair and perfect smiles!).

i can kind of see the appeal in the eastern european look if you're into porn stars i guess. i'm not terribley keen on the indian or arab look, sometimes the girls can be stunning but most of my asian and middle eastern friends have issues with body hair, which i find slightly off putting...!
 
 
Bollywood babes get beaten quite alot, I hear.

I'm clearly oblivious to the world around me...
 
 
haha no way india!

with a population as large as it is, you're bound to get some stunners, but on average, i wouldn't say they're anything special...

i'd say spanish/latin/swedish are pretty much as good as it gets!
 
 
well i don't know....i think that some of the most beautiful women in the world are of mixed race. having said that there are beautiful people in every country.

as for sweden and india that seems to come up frequently on this thread, they are good looking. swedish men   but british men are very good looking as well

Um, Hrithik looks like a monkey? Shahruhk Khan is Mr. Monkey Man himself. Well, no he actually looks more like a rodent, which is even worse. I don't know why women find him attractive. And your a guy so I don't know how good of a judge you are. But Amitabh is pretty sexy, I guess I should have added him to my original list. But I don't know why you say SRK and Amitabh are more "intelligent"
than Aamir, Saif, or Hrithik.

have you ever seen their interviews, it shows that they are intelligent. hrithik is no where near SRK. shah rukh is 100 times better than hrithik. im a guy but its obvious if someone is ugly. you should see the way SRK handles the media, its very cleverly done by him. i do not see why teenage girls fancy hrithik roshan too. maybe women find him attractive because he can act!

Women find SRK attractive because he can act? I'm pretty sure that I have never seen a worse actor. Sure he can play that sort of "charming" and fun guy, but he totally over acts and is not convincing at all. His facial expressions are so overdone and strange and then when things get really dramatic and he starts to talk he does this thing where he stutters and his bottom lip shakes, and it is so annoying and unconvincing. And if you think that he is good looking you definitely need glasses because this guy is ugly.

 

And I don't even like Hrithik Roshan that much. I definitely prefer Saif or Aamir, but he is really beautiful in Krrish.

Oh, and sorry, this doesn't really have anything to do with which country has the most beautiful women.

have you noticed how hrithik acts like srk tho. how can u say srk acting bad, did you think he became a megastar for no reason. look at the hits shahrukh has and compare it to any other actor except big b you would see shahrukh is better. yo people if u wanna see shah rukh look at my avatar.
aamir khan is ok but he overacts at times and also does the same dance moves. however you always hear that all the bollywod babes want to work with shah rukh khan!
 
oh you must like his two thumbs on one hand.
 
 
seriously, this conversation is getting really stupid. i don't like shahruhk. i think he is ugly and a bad actor, though i'm sure he is a fine person. i don't know why so many indians like him. i guess people in india are just weird. thats the only explanation i can come up with. i know someone like him would never really become popular among Americans. i have no idea what it is about him that makes people like him, and you haven't really been able to explain it to me and you probably never will. i guess when i watch his movies i see ugly guy + bad acting and a lot of indians see charming guy + nice personality.

but saif ali khan will always be on the top of my list. he is definitely good looking and hes a great actor who can do a wide range of role. and hrithik is an awesome dancer and abhishek has sex appeal (amitabh is too old) and aamir just appeals to me for some reason. and shah rukh is really really famous.
 
 
i will say all countrys have beautiful woman but most wear too much make up and etc i say the most natural beautiful woman are african or latino women  
 
 
there is only one possible answer to this thread.......WALES has the most beautiful women....who doesnt like scraped back hair and loads of eye makeup look and intellegience i mean they figure out how to have kids at a much younger age then other nationality!....

(no offence to welsh people...i am welsh myself)
 
 
ive said it before and ill say it again

any scandinavian country!

finland, iceland, denmark, sweden and norway

best looking peoples!!!

huh. well i personally like big noses. not ugly noses like shah ruhk khan, but a nice big nose like saif ali khan who i think is absolutely gorgeous. i don't know, i guess it's just a matter of preference, because even though i'm not indian, i think a lot of indian guys are really cute.
 
 
does most beautful refer to quality or quantity? ie does it mean which country has the best looking women, or which country has the highest number of beautiful women?

wow, miss world is ugly, just an average overtanned blonde
 
 
I think latino women are amongst the most beautiful in the world. IMHO. So yeah, you're looking at Brazil, Venezuela and Puerto Rico etc
 
 
Eastern Europe definitely- Czech Republic, Slovakia, Latvia, Russia, Lithuania, etc and of course Poland  
 
 
China?   Pretty Pretty women in china.
 
 
Sweden seem to be mentioned very often here.

Can't really say I'm surprised. Swedish women is by far the most beautiful ones this world has to offer, no question about it =)

I'm from Greece myself. We have some really beautiful women aswell, but comparing them with sweden's would be a disgrace.

i can kind of see the appeal in the eastern european look if you're into porn stars i guess. i'm not terribley keen on the indian or arab look, sometimes the girls can be stunning but most of my asian and middle eastern friends have issues with body hair, which i find slightly off putting...!

 

Thread winner! Aussie girls are beeeaaauuuutiful! Agree with the second paragraph too.

Still, you do get the occasional English rose, don't forget!
 
 
Russia !
x
 
 
Brazilian and Swiss girls are nice.

Am i the only one who thinks that it's the way foreign girls dress and present themselves that makes up alot of it, not just their looks?

There are some girls that come to my work sometimes to buy stuff and they are polish i think, but they walk around in short skirts and high heels, and are stunning girls. But put a pair of jeans on them and they look like any other English girl.
 
 
British!  

I joke...

Eastern European and Scandavania for me. America has some exceptional girls.  
 
 
Sweden or one of the other Scandinavian countries.

I've got a proper thing for Japanese girls at the moment too, so just for the sake of it, Japan  
 
 
Persian girls always do it for me!
 
 
Eastern Europe definitely has it going on. I went to Slovenia not so long ago and there were absolutely stunning girls there. I am definitely in love with that half of the continent and think a bit of travelling could be in order!
 
 
Reading a book called Affluenza by Oliver James. He claims Russian women are amongst the most beautiful he's seen. Lucky cows!
 
 
Finland, of course   !
 
 
Sweeden, Czech, Poland, Italy, Spain, Germany, Russia
 
 
Sweden!!
 
 
I'd say that the most "versatile" beauty you'll find in Eastern Europe,,
however if you find one particular type of women beautiful i'd say Sweden for pale/blond/blue eyes type, Venezuela for dark type and Japan for Asian type  
 
 
If we are talking about the average woman on the street then it has to be between Aussies, Swedish or Brazilian girls.
If your talking about the models etc then India would fit.
 
 
Some German women are fit.

Northern European   Sweden, Finland and Norway      

I was watching "Hallo Deutschland" and this women came on to read the news. I swear i watched every single edition i could for the rest of my holiday.

 http://www.yvonneransbach.de/yvonne-...ergalerie.html 

She is fit and German. I like.
 
 
south american women definitely, for instance Brazil.. after all, isn't that where Adriana Lima's from?
 
 
Some middle eastern women (and men) are gorgeous...

Also, Italian/Greek can be hotties. As can Latinos. And Russians. I bloody hate those perfectly gorgeous, intelligent Russians.

Wouldn't say Chinese or Japanese on the whole.
 
 
I think women frm Israel,India,Middle eastern countries n mexico r the most beautiful.
 
 
Northern Ireland, clearly..haha, huge joke there!

Definitely Norway, Brazil, Spain, USA (so many mixed ethnicities) and Italy.
 
 
I'd say Iran after India. There are a minority of extremely beautiful Indian women especially from the North, but isn't it funny how we see light skinned Indians as the beautiful rather than the southern darker skinned Indian women?
 
 
I saw so many beautiful girls in the United States
 
 
Indian!

(although i might be slightly biased)

Yeah, people might argue that a lot of girls in the states are overweight, but not the girls that I date. Just my opinion... but cleanliness and personal hygiene go a long way.

 

Wow, so wait you just categorized a world population minus the US as being unhygienic. Okay, you know what, you did offend a lot of people, I'm from Cyprus and here people in general have to be some of the cleanest in the world, I'm not saying that they aren't beaten, but certainly not by the Americans. On an average, every Cypriot takes a shower at least once a day in summer and 4 times a week in winter, and the women here take care of themselves incredibly, and don't just let go when they're married. Also, they're all great at domestic hygiene as well, which is something a lot of other countries lack. I'm just saying, you shouldn't talk crap and generalize when the US has a history of a few centuries and was made a home to by so many nations that you can't really call them a Uniform people yet since the genes still have some time to mix till you become a nation as a whole.

Out of curiosity, why Singapore? I mean, Malaysia's just up North of Singapore and we've got the population of Singapore * 6 or 7.. And the peoples are of about the same racial backgrounds.. just perhaps more diversity in Malaysia. humm

I've been to Malaysia as well. I could say the same thing about Indonesia which is just south of Singapore. I think Singapore has a greater mix of cultures in a small space, and they tend to be pretty rich down there. Rich men = hot women, what can I say  
 
 
Definately

1. Korea
2. Japan
3. France
4. Russia

I agree, while the US does have fit girls I've equally seen a huge amount of fat ugly slobs. Kind of equals out, he obviously hasn't been around as much as he claims, in Japan/Korea hygiene is a must which is deeply rooted into the culture (like public bath houses and hot springs). Places like Tokyo and Singapore are the cleanest cities in the world. The US just doesn't compare.

3 Sweden
4 Puerto Rico
5 Netherlands
5 Finland
6 Trinidad and Tobago
7 Brazil
8 South Africa

 

I can't really pick a country because i every country has uglies and beauties. some countries are less known than others or don't have any famous 'exports'.
one could argue that the reason venezula and india have won so many titles is because their train their misses for these competitions extremely hard and spend lots of money on it which other countries may not have.
 
 
damn it!

& theres me being the typical british, pale, mousy brown hair, pear shaped person.....arrgg
but tbh alot of the british dont help themselves...constantly bleaching their hair is doing more harm than good (thanks to dry stringy hair and root regrowth noticable every 4 weeks...why i dont bother); team that with too much makeup, unflattering clothes and fake tan (especially sunbeds) is just making matters worse. the british rose look can work if you work with it not against it.

all countries have their good looking and less attractive peoples but i'd say swedish, australian, some eastern, european japanese and mixed raced poeple
 
 
First a nod to what seems to be a favourite on this thread, Iran! Then I'd say anywhere in south America/Mediterranean really  
 
 
I definitely believe that Middle Eastern women are the most beautiful. Oh how I wish I looked more like them!   But to be fair, as with all races, there will be very stunning ones and very ugly ones.
 
 
In my opinion:
Italy, Brazil, Russia, Sweden, Israel, Iran, Lithuania, Latvia (apparently). I have to say America too, but that's only because the stupidly hot ones put in so much money & effort into being hot, I suppose the same could be said for Brazilians, but i'll let them off for being amazing!

Wow I just realised this thread is so old, i've probably posted in it already haha. And whoever said Brazilian girls don't shower is way off, in Rio they shower like twice a day.
 
 
England, brazil, italy.
 
 
Do not forget Ethiopian.........look like arab and indian had a offspring with a sprinkle of african.
 
 
I like Russian women.
 
 
in my opinion i like the face of the asians. simple look makes a perfect impression for me.
 
 
ethiopian, somali.
oh and venezuelian women are gorgeous.
 
 
India's 2nd...what?!  

 
 
 
Ethiopian,SOMALI ?
Come on guys, this is not a ''where are you from'' country..
There are many beautiful girls and many monsters everywhere in the world.However,if I had to name a country, this would be Sweden.I have been in Sweden on a vacation and I have to say every 3rd girl was totally worth it!Also, the other Scandinavian countries (Norway,Denmark,Finland) have many beautiful girls.
There are many,many beautiful girls in Eastern Europe as well.Consider Russia,Serbia,Bulgaria,Slovakia, Slovenia,Poland,Ukraine.I am from Bulgaria and I have to admit girls here are simply stunning.Most of them are,of course,very material but most of the girls worldwide are such.
According to the stereotypes, Spanish girls are considered very hot.This is so not true.I have been to Spain several times and many of them are pretty average.Nothing special.I met a lot of hotties in Italy, but not as much as in Greece and Bulgaria.
I have also been to the USA but cannot say their women are the best simply because in the USA you never know where the person you are speaking to originate from.She may be Italian,German,Swedish, you name it

But to say that Indian girls are the best is simply STUPID.No offense, although there are many famous Indian beauties, India`s population is over a billion.What is the probability to meet on of them ?
Somali,Ethiopian..come on

To sum up, it is disgrace to just cite different countries.In my EXPERIENCED opinion, the most beautiful women are those from Eastern Europe and Scandinavia.
 
 
Northern European countries: Scandinavia, the Netherlands.. Every time I go to Holland, it hits me how people are generally better looking there   and tall!
 
 
I really wouldnt say us English woman are much to shout home about.
I think girls from Sweden are beautiful   USA has alot of pretty women but alot of the time its less natural because its such a comerical country - if that makes sense.
 
 
Every country! you fool.
 
 
It has to be sweden, the average swedish girls are just so hot and she isnt even a model or so. south american women are beautiful too the ones that dont look like drag queens that is. And to indian women all the pretty ones get picked for bollywood movies so the rest cant be all that so they aint getting my vote.
And im not being biased here as Im from neither of these countries..

Omg jst realised how old this thread is..oh well
 
 
This thread is pretty stupid. Every country has beautiful women, it all depends on the population tbh!
 
 
Nice to see Latvian and other Eastern European women mentioned.

However, it's true that every country has both the beautiful and the plain ones.
 
 
Brasil, Spain, Italy, Sweden...
 
 
I say Pakistan..........Pakistani women are more attractive than Indian women and that has been stated by Indian women themselves. Also the number of titles won by a country does not indicate "the level of beauty"....the only reason Pakistani women never won a title apart from Miss Pakistan World is because they are not allowed to participate........... This is only in comparison to Indian women. Apart from that I feel Arabic women are gorgeous especially in Saudi Arabia.

I think you left out the majority of the world. All the countries you listed are only in Europe. You know there are very beautiful women in other parts of the world as well.

Most European women tend to look old quick, and get wrinkles.

Scandinavians are proven to have unsymmetrical faces compared to people with dark hair and skin. I read that somewhere one time. Therefore that makes them not as attractive. I think most people choose Swedish as being the most beautiful only because they like blondes. Its like they let the blonde hair blind them. But if you really look at the faces of Scandinavians, you will see that they really arent that attractive.

everys world has beauitful women with different world.
 
 
I definitely prefer India,in India girls are beautiful and also intelligents.  
 
 
Definately Sweden, Or any of the skandinavian countries really.
 
 
all the girls in Scandinavian countries look the same...and they're skin is too pale.

In north america we have VARIATION in looks...thats the best!

I dont know why europeans are so arrogant...you have no reason to be. most European nations aren't even that organized and developed. the only ones that are are Germany and switzerland.
 
 
Beautiful women can be found in any country BUT.........

After travelling to many countries I will have to give my Vote to India..

not only Indian from India but INDIANS from U.K USA and Canada.
indian women are extremely attractive they can stop traffic for the most part, ISN'T PAKISTANI EQUALLY WASN'T PAKISTAN PART OF INDIA I REFER THEM TO CLEARLY SOUTH ASIANS.
They are also other attractive women from Brazil Venezuela and lebanon but my first vote is definitely INIDA....
 
 
agreed for INDIA

Israel! I've travelled quite a bit and I've never seen such beautiful people anywhere. I think it's because of the great variety in genes that the younger Israelis have. People from all over the world moved to Israel and their children are just amazingly attractive, both men and women  
 
 
I love my women to have deep sexy eyes beautiful tan skin and longish dark hair who fits this INDIAN WOMEN OR SPANISH WOMEN...
FROM A WHITE DUDE I ADMIRED INDIAN WOMEN TREMENDOUSLY.

Italian women FTW, not because I'm part Italian or anything.....

It's all about the Italian fashion, food, men and cars.
 
 
Probably Italy, Spain and France. Having said that I have a Norwegian friend who is gorgeous too.
 
 
The UK does too. Kirsty Allsopp <3
 
 
Lebanon/Syria/Isreali are stunning.. seriously

Iranian come next, and then maybe Cypriot

English girls are pretty low down on the list tbh..
 
 
Oh swedish girls are hawt too

I love their round faces
 
 
india!
 
 
India had many very very naturally looking beautiful girls. Persia also!
 
 
I've just had a look at those indian actors you have named shahrukh khan and hrithik and both of them are very good looking. hrithik roshan i would go as far to say is one of the best looking males i've ever seen!
 
 
italy
 
 
when is a poll of this thread gonna be made?

Funny just a joke everyone seem to think that Brazilain women are the worlds most atractive... this is such a joke.
I lived in Brazil for 5 years in Rio...they have some very attractive women living in Brazil but not every brazilian are drop dead georgous as the maees will think.
FRANKLY THEY ARE ATTRACTIVE WOMEN IN EVERY CONTRY IN THE WORLD...
YOU WILL HOWEVER FIND A HIGHER PERCENTAGE IN INDIA MAYBE OF THIER POPULATION.....
if you are attracted to Pale skin then white women will ULTIMATELY be your choice,,,
if you are into tan complexion from light medium or dark tan INDIA GOTTA BE THE CHOICE.....
 
 
silly thread for obvious reasons

but i think black women are usually attractive   dunno what country exactly..
also a lot of beautiful people are a mix
and just to be biased, woo middle eastern women  

but yeah silly generalising thread  
 
 
Nepal, The Phillipines, Libya, India,Pakistan, and Nova Scotia.-in no particular order. Judged only by appearance and personal experience.
 
 
Sweden and Newcastle  
 
 
Italy is good
 
 
Ha. Those Bollywood actresses have so much make up, coloured contacts, and photoshopping done. I'd say Pakistani or Arabian girls in a general consensus. They have gorgeous features. Indians girls too, definitely. Regardless of whether they're South or North. But depends on the person.
But Bollywood actresses are not representative of the majority of Indian girls. Well, unless you picked the ones who wore a lot of make up, photoshopped themselves up, etc.

Every race has gorgeous women. =]
 
 
Sweden, Russia, Italy, Spain, Holland

In that order  
 
 
any of the arabic countries, those chicks have beautiful eyes  
 
 
Probably any country in South America.
 
 
I think people from Saudi Arabia have amazing eyes  
thats about it really lol
 
 
 
any of the arabic countries, those chicks have beautiful eyes  

 

Lol at the pic you got of that woman from Eastenders!
Such an annoying character.

Honestly, I don't know why India is on there. Yes, they have a select few that are exceptionally beautiful. But in the grand scheme of things, if you go to India, it's VERY difficult to spot even a relatively attractive person. Unless you have really low standards of course. I'm by no means being racist, but that's what I've noticed.

Out of all countries that I've visited, I'd say Iranian women are very attractive (I'm partial to the looks of the men).

(I visited India last year with an Indian friend)
 
 
I thought the topic was 'which country has the most beautiful name"! I was getting ready to type out a great long list.
But beautiful women, beauty is subjective and everything, and I'd say North European. Only probably because I've never been out of Europe though. I don't think any culture is more beautiful than another though, in the way of looks. Some English girls look more exotic than 'exotic girls' and both can be beautiful or not.
 
 
 
Persian girls( Iranian girls)..,you can google it !

 

I completely agree  
 
 
Norway  
 
 
I am responding to people that leave comment about indian women not that attractive only a selective few...
I visited india on 2 ocassion and the girls i saw on the streets of chennai mumbai and delhi can stop traffic...
If you consider a cladly dress women to be the world most attractive then you certainly need another tread...
The majority of women worldwide is seen attractive exposing all they got.indian women can put most other women to a shame with beauty and class...

Yeaah it is kind of a weird thread, because there are beautiful women everywhere, and for example in Lebanon, Joran and Syria for example there are many many women of Palestinian descent, same with other countries.

EDIT: also it's subjective, everyone has their own opinion on what is 'beautiful' and what is not. Some person’s beautiful may be another person’s ugly.
 
 
people always say that the russian girls are beautiful.
 
 
You should have done a poll.
 
 
Technically it's China if your into Chinese women or India if your into Indian women.
 
 
No Country in the UK that's for sure!
 
 
IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER.

Brazil
Cuba
Ghana
Dominican Republic
Zimbabwe
Eritrea
Jamaica
Japan
Phillipines
Italy and other southern european countries
 
 
 
people always say that the russian girls are beautiful.

 

Buahahahahahahaha don't be ridiculous. Unless you like the potato peasant look.
 
 
I LOVE indian women I think they are gifted with poise beauty talent and natural goodness.
Caucasian and African will just too love having them including me,,,,

Spain/Brazil/Mexico

Places like that, Spanish talking Latino girls  
 
 
South american countries like brazil, argentina, colombia hence:
  and also french girls:  
 
 
Lebanon ofcourse!!
Also, iranian girls are GORGEOUS, as well as spanish/latinas..  
 
 
India does but I swear it's only mainly in Bollywood.
I tend to think it's Indians which have migrated to Western countries which look more appealing

at least christine found a constructive way of reinforcing her opinion, unlike you: 'white women are ugly'. obv. you're indian yourself.
to be honest, i agree with christine. i have never, ever, seen an attractive Indian lady. but, maybe that's cause i live in london, not india.
 
 
 
Brazil have beautiful women...... but for beauty and intelligence.... it defo goes to india!

Just look at some of the girls:

Ashwariya and Priyanka are very pretty   Although the good looks aren't as universal when it comes to some of the males  
 
 
 
India for women but I hate Indian men, cant stand them.

 

I'm Indian, I can't stand Indian men either
 
 
Sweden.  
 
 
 
at least christine found a constructive way of reinforcing her opinion, unlike you: 'white women are ugly'. obv. you're indian yourself.
to be honest, i agree with christine. i have never, ever, seen an attractive Indian lady. but, maybe that's cause i live in london, not india.

 

My friend is Indian and she is gorgeous, but that is in no way representative. I would say girls from Italian, Lebanon and Brazil are usually beautiful.  
 
 
Iceland or Ireland.
 
 
Most countries have beautiful women... There are some Gorgeous British girls as well... There are gorgeous females in most countries.
 
 
I'd say India.
 
 
Why you no have Sweden? But out of that list, I would have to say Brazil.
 
 
i saw some of the hottest women i've ever seen in my life in brazil. not all the women were hot, but the ones that were.....**** me

but scandinavian countries also have some ****in beautiful women too...a completely different kind of hotness to brazil but still beautiful none the less....i can appreciate that kind of stuff ya get me

man i just love vagina

Possibly the best and most all-encapsulating reply on this thread.

no, sorry mate
 
 
Another wierd thread I stumbled upon on TSR... Anyway, I'm Swedish and when I went to Israel a few years ago one of the things that really struck me was how beautiful the women there were.
 
 
Uhmmm. No idea whatsoever. I seem to see beautiful girls wherever i go.

But i can say, i agree with the indian man thing. In Bollywood, there isn't one girl who's not gorgeous. I only find ONE guy good looking though - Hrithik Roshan. There are some pretty hot Indian boys in this country though haha.
 
 
 
Ok maybe that was harsh on the Iceland one, here's the best one I could find on google images:

 

Sorry couldn't find a better one for the Denmark one.  

 

That's taken at the Blue Lagoon so they're probably tourists anyway!  
 
 
Arabs.

On that point, there is an awesomely beautiful arab girl who btw I think she knows it, but while wearing the headscarf still is more beautiful than a girl without. She gets wolf-whistled and also a lot of male attention.

I think she is modest though but the shameful thing is she knows she is attractive. I guess you'd be exploiting this,  
 
 
Spain.
 
 
Any Arabic or Indian country. Majority are ugly, but when they are fit...man they are FIT
 
 
England
 
 
Has this basically turned to: what country are you from? I mean India?!  
 
 
This is so pointless. There are pretty people everywhere. And obviously, people are biased  
 
 
 
I dont just mean physical beauty... but intelligence aswell......

Officially it is India and Venezuela.......

But what do you guys think?

These are the countries which have won ther most miss world and miss universe titles combined.....

1 Venezuela
2 India
3 Sweden
4 Puerto Rico
5 Netherlands
5 Finland
6 Trinidad and Tobago
7 Brazil
8 South Africa

 

Makes sense.
All i can say though is if you are looking for physical and intellectual beauty then the UK is definitely the...loser due to its armies of short broad women who know more about the Xfactor then they know about themselves.

 
This is so pointless. There are pretty people everywhere. And obviously, people are biased  

 

Not really. All recent studies show that guys prefer similar shapes ergo it is a perfectly valid question.

 
Most countries have beautiful women... There are some Gorgeous British girls as well... There are gorgeous females in most countries.

 

Of course everywhere will have beautiful women, but they will have varying amounts, Britain being at the bottom end of this scale.
 
 
Swedish girls are hot.
 
 
 
Swedish girls are hot.

 

Yes, there are many pretty girls in Sweden.. But I get the "Scandinavian women are tall, blonde and attractive" a lot. It's a stereotype. I'm especially tired of the way Swedish girls are treated and the Swedish girls stereotype.
 
 
1. Norway/Sweden
2. Denmark,Finland
3. France
 
 
No pictures? I am disappoint.
 
 
Iran, Lebanon/Syria, Czech Republic, Iceland, Albania, Former Yugoslavia.

Trust me, women from those countries are insanely hot.
 
 
 
1. Norway/Sweden
2. Denmark,Finland
3. France

 

Nordic countries  

oh here I'm being biased again  
 
 
 
I'm Norwegian, so I know it's true !
Having lived in Norway, England and France I have to say Norway has to best-looking women, whether they fit the stereotype or not  

 

Ooh, another Norwegian  

That's nice to know, lol.

The bold part made me lol!

"Armies"

 
 
 
As someone mentioned, if we're looking at Beauty Pageants as a way of measuring, Venezuela absolutely storms away with it. They have 18 "grand slam" crowns to date, and those are only the big 5 pageants (Miss World, Universe, International, Earth and some tourism shambles), add to that how many other titles they've won and they definitely are the ones to beat.

These were the girls they sent to the "big 3" this year, and this was a fairly average year for them:

  Marelisa Gibson, Miss Universe (unplaced)

  Adriana Vasini, Miss World (3rd overall)

  Elizabeth Mosquera, Miss International (winner)

Personally i'm not keen on any of them having seen them on the stage. Marelisa's smile creeped me out a bit, Adriana looked a bit chalky in her Miss World Makeup and Elizabeth almost looked to have a puffy face with blemishes. Their batch for 2011 isn't much better...but if they can still place 2/3 in the top 5 of a pageant each year they're doing something right!
 
 
Spain... i went on holiday to Ibiza and literally everyone was phwoaarrr
 
 
Eastern Europeans, Czechs, Russians, Italians, Greeks etc.

Definitely not Asians, although the Japanese aren't bad.
 
 
Liechtensteinian women are AMAZING. Having been to Brazil, Sweden and Russia, I didn't think I'd ever find a place with more beautiful women than those three countries, but then I went to Liechtenstein and my jaw just DROPPED; every single woman in Vaduz (the capital of Liechtenstein, I know most people know that but maybe not everyone) was just stunning beyond belief, it's crazy!   I don't understand how this isn't more well-know, but I'm happy because I go back every year and I don't have to share this feast for the eyes with thousands of other drooling tourists. (Maybe I shouldn't have told you guys haha!   )
 
 
Physically, Poland has gorgeous women. And whilst I was there, I did not see any attractive men. Maybe a good place to go guys :P

Eastern Europe/Russia has some beautiful women too.

Mind you, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. There are attractive people in every country.
 
 
No offence but people here are mostly baised in celebs and beauty pageants. To me they are usually fakes. Some have surgery done, some have a kilo of makeup on. There are some who are naturally pretty but it's quite rare.
To me mixed race and orientals have beautiful women. But I am baised myself since I am oriental  
 
 
Anything in Eastern Europe. Latin American bodies are killer.
 
 
1 - Venezuela or Brazil
2 - Iran
3 - Denmark

 
Has this basically turned to: what country are you from? I mean India?!  

 

Who do you suggest? Britain ?  
 
 
Europe

- France
- Italy
- Greece

Asia

- Syria
- Lebanon
- Jordan
- Iran

Africa

- Algeria

Latin America

- Columbia
- Argentina
- Venezuela
 
 
This thread mostly deals with people personal opinion on what race of women they are attracted towards..
every person have different view of a woman race,
i live in a big city in London and for me to say that im a white guy but i dont find white women attractive may sound lame, but in all honesty it depends on what i view as a personal tatse in women..
dontb get me wrong thay are attractivbe white women but im more attracted to women that are tan naturally i find myself attracted to south asian women..which most people refer to as INDIAN....
brazilain are hot too so is Spanish women i guess my personal taste is tan women with dark hair and eyes....
but gemnerally all beautiful women are hot despite where they from
 
 
 
I dont just mean physical beauty... but intelligence aswell......

Officially it is India and Venezuela.......

But what do you guys think?

These are the countries which have won ther most miss world and miss universe titles combined.....

1 Venezuela
2 India
3 Sweden
4 Puerto Rico
5 Netherlands
5 Finland
6 Trinidad and Tobago
7 Brazil
8 South Africa

 

It's impossible to determine where the best women are. It's not because one country has won a contest that the majority of its inhabitants are suddenly smart foxes.
Personal preferences vary so much anyway!

...but I admit mediterranean girls do seem to be one league above the rest  
 
 
Nordic & Eastern European people are extremely attractive (:
 
 
A little bit of everything, I think mixed women are mostly gorgous, especially with some black or latino blood. (adriana lima)

But lately i'm into (age 16-25) girls from East africa, those women are rarely hidous.
 
 
I don't know about a specific country but white people - men and women - are by far the most attractive people, in my opinion. Just my subjective taste.

Even the non-white people I find attractive tend to have a little white in them e.g. half-caste people.
 
 
This thread is biased   only Indians would say Indians are attractive. To me personally, scandinavian or russian.
 
 
Not England, Wales or Scotland that's for sure!

Even though I'm also white, I disagree. Asian and Black (without white mixture) can be very sexy. Amerie and Cassie ventura for an example

 

 
 
 
I think Columbia needs a shout.
 
 
Eg trur at norske kvinner er dei vakreste i hele verda. (What better reason is there to learn Norwegian   ?)

Brazil or Lebanon
 
 
The mixed heritages are lovely. For example, Asian (either chinese or indian) with English.
 
 
From what I've seen of the world:
1. Latvia (yeah, that isn't a typo)
2. Denmark
3. Sweden

And from mere speculation: Brazil. I've only ever met 3 Brazilian girls and they've all been stunning.
 
 
Its so wierd...Im half Pakistani and half Italian but I can never tell which I look.

90% of people say I look Italian but then someone the other day said that Italian girls are not good looking, only Italian men are! :O  
 
 
I have a co worker at work she is from India, At first we all thought she was Brazilian until she reveal the guessing game.she is the most feminine woman I have ever meet, she is so natural pretty and so sexy without trying,Olive skin beautiful eyes, sweet smile and a gorgeous body, the way she talks and smile drives me crazy every morning before we start working we are all ( men) waiting to see her, she comes and smile "Good morning guys " we all melt with her presence. Bessie If you ever read this, we all the guys at work are in love with you, ( WE ARE jealous of your John )You are the most beautiful woman we have ever met. I am so glad I met you, One day i will travel to India and look for my own East Indian Girll like you.
 
 
Argentina girls  
 
 
Brazil or South korean.

pics wanted now!
/5 year old topic revived  
 
 
India obvz  
 
 
 
Some middle eastern women (and men) are gorgeous...

Also, Italian/Greek can be hotties. As can Latinos. And Russians. I bloody hate those perfectly gorgeous, intelligent Russians.

Wouldn't say Chinese or Japanese on the whole.

 

I completely Agree with all what youve said, esp the highlighted bits.
But I might be a little biased, since I am half Middle Eastern half Russian.  
 
 
 
Eastern Europeans like Russians, Estonia, Lithunia, Latvia and also Italians i think.

 

 

Italians and Russians ftw

Not that Im part Italian or Russian or anything...... : whistle :  
 
 
Italy, and I'm going to say America because of the proportion of hot mexican/white mixed race
babes  
 
 
brazilian, indian and italian!  
 
 
So going slightly off topic I proclaim that the theme song for this thread shall be:
B.O.B. - Nothing on You - ft Bruno Mars

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PTDv_szmL0 

Plus I can't decide which country has the most beautiful due to "other" reasons    
 
 
Whichever country I happen to be in at the present moment in time.  
 
 
 
I would say Pakistan or Iran, the only reason they aren't in the offical list is cos Pakistan doesn't "allow" it........

Hmmm but Brazil has the sexiest footy fans......

But for both beauty and intelligence it has to go to India no doubt  

 

I dont know many Pakistani or Indian girls but Im detecting a undertone of racism in your comment

A Pakistani still won Beauty of Asia

for the Most Attractive Women...
Check MEXICO INDIA/PAK RUSSIA BRAZIL SWEDEN LEBANON in that order
enuff said.

Out of all you excluded Venezuela or Netherlands ?: (
dutch chicks  
 
 
Brazil
India
North East African (Somalia, Ethopia Djib etc NOT Tanzania and the like)
North African Arab or Berber
Iran
Denmark
Hungary #1 - I am serious. They make Italian women look like men.
 
 
 
What about Turkey? Azra Akin won Miss World in 2002.....and she was beautiful!

 

I know their family in real and didn't think that Azra was that attractive in comparison with the rest of the family.
 
 
Obviously subjective as I am Scandinavian myself, but Norway, Sweden and Denmark has an extreme amount of genuinely beautiful girls compared to any other country I have lived in/been to. Especially those from the capital cities, Oslo, Stockholm and Copenhagen. Good facial symmetry, feminine features and very good physique. At school back home, half of the girls in my class were models. I've lived in England and France after that, and well...it's different.
 
 
I would say Arab women   their features are amazing (L) maybe Syria and Lebanon to be more specific.
 
 
As an American, I would have to say the United States.
As a Hispanic, I would have to say Central American women.

 
 
 
Qatar.
 
 
Colombian & Venezuelen women are the most beautiful in the world.
 
 
South America, Russia (and it's former Eastern European colonies) and Puerto Rico have most attractive women, imo.

But I would say the Russians would win my vote overall, taking into account intelligence too (Russia has one of the world's best education systems).
 
 
Trust me people, Indian girls are NOTHING of what you see in the Bollywood indian movies. Those actresses are like 20 beautiful girls in a billion ugly girls. And just because its those 20 girls who have been so commercialized by the movies, does NOT mean that all Indian girls are beautiful.

If you're talking about South Asia, i think Pakistani girls are the most beautiful. People dont know much because the Pakistani movie/TV industry is not that commercialized and hence you dont get to see them very often, but oh man, they are NICE!

Other than that, i think, girls from Lebanon, Iran, and some East European countries are absolutely gorgeous.

Girls from Brazil are also nice but i think they're too slutty imo.
 
 
DUTCH AND KURDISH PEOPLE  
since i come from there *coughcough*

but no seriously, russian girls are just...WOAHH they intimidate me so much ;-; makes me feel like a man

Hahahahhahahahahha. No.
 
 
 
Hahahahhahahahahha. No.

 

I wasn't trying to be funny.
I didn't say South American/Puerto Rican girls were stupid either. I was basing my opinion on education systems.
 
 
Everyone is beautiful in their own way  
 
 
In my opinion - Latvian girls are very beautyful.

Heinrich Heine did describe Polish women as "Angels on Earth" and "Aphrodites of the Vistula".

Flame thread written all over it.
 
 
No offense, but most of you Europeans need to get your heads out your asses. Ive traveled to many countries in Europe and youre all very ignorant about the rest of the world. Most of you are racist and think that the world is only made up of the continent of Europe. Maybe its because I come from North America, where I see a variety of people and cultures EVERYDAY, so I accept other cultures and races, and I see us all as the SAME. I wish you Europeans would learn to be like this as well.

I find it interesting that most of you only mention European countries when answering this question. It shows how close minded you are. Just think about what I said...Im not trying to offend.

It's a matter of taste, mate. My taste says something else for instance. It neither finds Latinas attractive, nor Russians, nor arabs, nor Indians attractive. Therefore, it is a matter of taste. Simple  
 
 
I Will have to agree that Brazilian women get my vote second to that is definitely Indian women...
especially the Noth Indian women.. they just have that feature that stood out amongst the crowd...

Nother countries have more hot women than these two.(Brazil &india) follow by Russia Venezuela South Africa and Iran.
 
 
FTW= India
 
 
.........
 
 
Brazil or Iran
 
 
We are not talking about which country has most miss worlds etc.
Discussion is which country has most beautiful girls publicl, in fact
Having 3 or 4 miss worlds does not mean that majority ratio of girls population
In the country is beautiful, I have been to India and I have to say
Their girls are not beautiful at all except very few. Italian girls is my
Vote
 
 
Australia. Miranda Kerr, need I say any more.
 
 
i think Venezuela girls are veryy prety!
 
 
It's weird how so many people say Indian girls are beautiful, because in Britain a lot of non-Indian people don't go for/fancy Indian girls (well the people I know of, lol )

Referring to the British Indian girls here who share the same features as Indian nationals, to be fair we are better looking than Indian girls in India. The only Indian nationals that are hot are celebs
 
 
It´s Sweden no question about it, and I have the finest =)
 
 
Australia 4 ever!! Beauties everywhere. In addition, they have megasweet personalities.  
 
 
Mixed Asian women
Italian women
 
 
1) Nigeria
2) Niger
3) Sudan

 
 
 
1. Persians

2. Everyone else
