Officials from an opposition party in Sri Lanka said Monday that they have made
a complaint to Elections Commissioner Dayananda Dissanayake regarding state
media 's bias in the presidential campaign.

Sharmila Perera, secretary of the New Democratic Front (NDF) said several state
media institutions are violating articles of the constitution which prohibit the
use of state property to promote or prevent the election of any candidate.

Former Chief of Defense Staff General Sarath Fonseka is contesting the
presidency under the NDF as the common candidate of the opposition parties.

Perera said she has submitted a summary of violations by state media
institutions to Dissanayake, but the elections commissioner has not given her
any reply.

Sri Lanka's sixth presidential election will be held on Jan. 26, 2010 with the
two main players being incumbent President Mahinda Rajapakse and Fonseka.

Rajapakse and Fonseka are equally credited for the military victory against
Tamil Tiger rebels early this year.
