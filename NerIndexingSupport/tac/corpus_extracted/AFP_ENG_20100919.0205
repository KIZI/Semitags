Jordanian authorities have detained Issam Abu Mohammed al-Maqdessi, the former
mentor of slain Al-Qaeda in Iraq head Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a family friend said
on Sunday.

"The security services summoned him for questioning on Friday night. He did not
return to his home and I learned later that he was detained," the friend, who
declined to be identified, told AFP.

"We don't know why he was detained and he did not contact us."

In 1992, Zarqawi met Maqdessi, whose real name is Issam Barqawi, and later
joined his Sunni militant group Jaish Mohammed, or Mohammed's Army.

The pair were detained in Jordan for five years for membership in an outlawed
Islamist organisation but were freed as part of a general amnesty in 1999.

They later fell out over "ideological differences," however, and aides said
Barqawi repeatedly denounced Zarqawi in messages posted on his website.

Barqawi was arrested again in Jordan in 2005 after remarks he made to Al-Jazeera
television, but he was released in 2008 for "humanitarian reasons" after going
on hunger strike.

He has two wives and eight children.

Jordanian-born Zarqawi claimed responsibility for triple suicide bomb attacks on
Amman hotels in 2005 that killed 60 people. He was killed in a US raid in Iraq
in June 2006.
