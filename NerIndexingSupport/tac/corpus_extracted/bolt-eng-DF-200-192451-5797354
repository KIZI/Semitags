You hear a lot of criticism of Israel - but if you had to, would you rather live there or one of its closest neighbours? Bearing in mind Israel's freedoms, prosperity, etc.

Note: I know some of the countries don't physically neighbour Israel, but they are extremely close so they count.
 
 
Eygpt, probably because they're comparitively level and calm. (I said comparatively).
 
 
Egypt  
 
 
For religious, political and social freedom.

Israel
 
 
Because it's the most westernised, Israel.
 
 
I know a LOT of Lebanese people and let me tell you, they're the most fun loving persons I have ever met. Really open-minded and peaceful. It looks really beautiful too!

Probably this.

Let the negging commence  
 
 
Egypt seems to have quietened down a bit. And anyway, it's a really beautiful country!

Do you call this westernized?

And by this you're saying Israel is worse than this?
 
 
 
Lebanon...  

Place is chash.
 
 
Where was the picture taken?

I'm just saying that it is the state of Israel itself that causes all of the violence, whereas in countries like Lebanon there are only attacks executed by terrorist groups.
 
 
Israel or Jordan.

People die in riots everywhere...can't believe you said that?!

Just look at the england riots....thats "western."
 
 
Urgh, definitely its neighbours.

Israel or Jordan. I got so much attention in Jordan for being a whitey that I would feel like a celebrity.  
 
 
Israel

because its the least likely country to get bombed and invaded by Israel
 
 
Jordan or Israel.
Plus to all the people saying Egypt, really? Its future is very uncertain and Christians (assuming some of you are) are routinely not treated properly.

Israel but I have family there so I'm a bit biased.

lol, yeah - that isn't really typical of Israel. Places like Tel Aviv look cool.
 
 
Since you put Saudi Arabia on there, which doesn't border Israel, I'd prefer to live in Cyprus, since it's also a close neighbour.
 
 
Turkey?
 
 
Definitely Israel as I'm a proud Westerner and Israel is the last bulwark of Western civilisation against the threat of Islamification. Also Jews are mega smart and have a much higher qol.

No dont go to Israel, the Arab nations will invade it again soon, like they did in 1947, 67 and 71.

Why doo you want to know?
 
 
I've never been to Israel but Egypt is niceeee. Tourists get first class treatment too, and you'd pretty much be a full-time tourist there. As western as Israel is, there's too much drama there man.

not meaning to sound totally anti-semitic our ought but never in a million years isreal 'coz i hatee flippin jews for some odd reason
 
 
i dont care what the BIG NOSED, FAT CAT, POWER HUNGRY people think. by that i mean both muslims and jews say,,,,, i would not mind living in lebanon or syria, simply cos the people are open minded and really down to earth, though im scared to visit cos the israelis may just blow the place up,,,,,,, i would not mind israel but theres sometihng about israel that seems dangerous,

honestly.
 
 
i'd choosde Israel, Syria and Lebanon are both experiencing unrest, Eygpt, just come out of a revolution, Jordan, not sure tbh, Saudi Arabia, where are my freedoms  
 
 
Probs Saudi Arabia but only for religious purposes. Plus Israel is evil and I here quite racist. But that's only what I here.

Urm... **** off
 
 
 
Urm... **** off

 

Whats wrong?  
 
 
Even though you didn't put it, Id say the UAE which is next to saudi arabia. But seeing as that's not an option it probably would be Egypt.
 
 
 
Whats wrong?  

 

You need help

I'm Jewish but I still don't care for this crap.
 
 
Tel Aviv looks like an incredible place. I'd love to go there tbh

Hear we go again with the grammar nazis.  
 
 
 
Turkey?

 

yes!!

 

 
 
 
Egypt personally, like the people like the country
 
 
Jordan, probably.

I find that terribly offensive
 
 
Israel. But then I am Israeli (Arab) and half my family live there. Plus Palestine is my ancestral homeland so **** what others think.  

Syria is a socialist dictatorship.
Egypt is hideously sexist and archaic.
Lebanon is stupidly poor in areas, the electricity cuts out at random hours, and is plagued by civil wars and Hezbollah in the south. They barely have a postal system.
Jordan is unremarkable. Though majority Palestinian so maybe I'd fit in.  
Saudi Arabia (or anywhere gulf), I would rather die.

Tbf, the Levant > the rest of the Middle East.
 
 
I really have no idea why-- unless you were a devout Muslim-- you would choose Saudi Arabia over Israel. Unless you have no care for any of your freedoms. And before anyone makes any sarcy comments about Israel, at least a woman can drive there..
 
 
None, when I was in Cyprus the heat was too annoying, so I'd rather not reside in that region.
 
 
 
Where was the picture taken?

Lol no.

I find that I don't give a rats arse.

I find you very rude, you ****
 
 
Lebanon. Beirut is a relaxed, westernised place and the party capital of the middle east
 
 
Cyprus... what? Its only a little swim away i'd call it a neighbor, lived there for 2 years, lovely, go for a swim in the sea catch some rays on the saturday, then off to build a snowman on Troodos on the sunday, great little island.
 
 
Why do you make so many threads about Israel when you're not even Jewish?

Hahahahaha. Will have to +rep ya tomorrow  
 
 
Been to all the countries listed in the poll other than Jordan, Israel is still the better place to be as it's better organized and vast majority of the people there aren't zionist, they just live there because its their home.

Syria and Egypt, too many crooks for my taste. Also don't particularly care for the food there.

Lebanon, beautiful beaches, loads of beautiful women and lots to do considering where it is, but somehow it just doesn't feel safe.

Saudi... never been to a more repressive country, heck China feels like a liberal democratic country by comparison.
 
 
 
Do you call this westernized?

 

 

I am sure that you can bring up pictures like this of any country. I can certainly say that my own country (England) is not free of blame of causing atrocities like the one shown in your picture. Please open your eyes and see that human ignorance is not bound by the borders of countries, but has spread like wildlife since the dawn of mankind. Rant over.
 
 
Israel is the only semi-civilised country in that area. Bizarre that some people actually chose others, unless they have family there or something.
