 
 
The NFL Superbowl Thread! Back Again With Big Prizes*
 
 
Watch this space beginning January 2nd, 2012. We will give you, yes you, an opportunity to display your prowess in professional football even if you don't know or care about professional football. You could win the adulation of your co-workers. You could win fabulous prizes* here.
What does it cost to play? Nothing. Nothing except for about 5 minutes of your time. Total prep time: -0-. Cooking time: 5 minutes.
There will be the usual gang here as there have been for 6 or 7 years We invite newbies to A2K to join in and meet some of us from all over the globe. Many of us disagree about other issues, but here we set all that aside.
If the world ends in 2012, this could be your last chance to play.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

(usual gang-member reserving a spot...)
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I'm in.
 
 
dropping off a snack to hold my spot on the sofa

 
 
 
@ehBeth,

I'm always rather poor at this game, but remain interested in food scenarios.

In honor of the Dys, whom I don't remember as being ever concerned about football of any sort, I bring you a link for Frito Pie -

 
 
 
@ossobuco,

this was a big hit at the fair the last couple of years

tempted to try it, but haven't

 
 
 
@ehBeth,

I have steadfastly refused for several years now.
 
 
@ossobuco,

I want to try. Really. But chili and cheese inside a bag of Fritos... I'm not ready.
 
 
@ehBeth,

On my first visit in Abq, while I was going to house sit for Dys and Diane when they went to Europe and I considered the city as a place to live, the first place we went was the 66 diner.

Now, I traveled 66 several times as a kid, so I was saying yeah?, but also glad to see D & D and sit down and eat.

Dys ordered Frito Pie (how can I guess why? he liked it, or he was ribbing me, the food snot, or both).

I forget what I ordered, mediocre. Not that I don't like the place. I like it for the style and the wait staff, many over time friendly but never obnoxious, senses of humor. Food pretty much sucks, milking cheap.

Starting to think of chicken wings.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I'm in. Undoubtedly I'll not do well. For some reason I predict 49-ers to go all the way (at this moment). See what I mean? I should be like the mainstream crowd and predict Packers to go all the way. Such is my mavericky nature.
 
 
I'm in.
 
 
I am still waiting to see if the Bears get one of the wild card spots.  
 
 
I'm in.
 
 
So we are going to start with the four wild card games to be played on Saturday, Jan 7th and Sunday the 8th. The deadline for all 4 picks is around 4:30 ET on Saturday.
Please also include guesses as to the final scores.
I'll go over the rules for how this is all going to work once I remember what they are.

Sat 1/7-
4:30: Cincinnati Bengals (9-7 for the season) @ Houston Texans (10-6)
8:00: Detroit Lions (10-6) @ New Orleans Saints (13-3)

Sun 1/8-
1:00: Atlanta Falcons (10-6) @ NY Giants (9-7)
4:30: Pittsburgh Steelers (12-4) @ Denver Broncos (8-8)

Include the final scores, please.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

from what i could tell (didn't read the whole thing),  last year  we did not include final scores for the wildcat (sic) round...
 
 
@Region Philbis,

FWIW, I think the addition of the scores adds a positive wrinkle. What about you guys?
 
 
The final scores is new. I haven't come up yet with an idea for what I am going to do with that extra data. And I did ponder whether asking for that might be too time consuming for players.
In the past, a correct pick in the wildcard games earned 1 point, with 3 points in the next round, 5 in the next and 6 points in the Superbowl.
I can see a problem with players having a bracket broken and losing interest in following along for the conclusion of the game. That happens in the fantasy games when a player fails to make the playoffs. Offering some points for being closest to the final score might remedy that.
I am open to suggestions on all of the scoring rules to try to give each round its proper balance.

On another note, last year we had some 28 players or so, most of them from our year long pick-um game. I would like to get that up this year by emphasizing that knowledge of football is not at all required. To that end, I invite anyone with even a smidgeon of interest to post short snippets of wisdom (or trash talk).
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Sat 1/7-
4:30: Cincinnati Bengals (9-7 for the season) @ Houston Texans (10-6) HOU, 17 - 7
8:00: Detroit Lions (10-6) @ New Orleans Saints (13-3) NO, 17 - 7

Sun 1/8-
1:00: Atlanta Falcons (10-6) @ NY Giants (9-7) NYG, 17 - 7
4:30: Pittsburgh Steelers (12-4) @ Denver Broncos (8-8) PITT, 17 - 7

That's right, folks, there's only one possible scoring combo. And remember - I suck at this!
 
 
Cincinnati Bengals (21-20)
New Orleans Saints (38-17)

Atlanta Falcons (24-6)
Pittsburgh Steelers (20-13)

I sent emails this morning to the players in our A2K Fantasy football league. I heard back from Soup Kitchen. He is not on A2K but is a friend of someone who is (which is fine with me). At 7:30 this morning west coast time (I didn't know they got up that early there) he picked:
Bengals (24-17)
Lions (42-41)
Giants (27-24)
Steelers (39-3)
 
 
Bengals 21-17
Saints 35-31
Giants 24-21
Steelers 24-10
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Water Cooler Talk For Tuesday, Jan 3rd:
1) Adopt a bit of a sneering attitude.
2) "Denver? They finished first in their dreadful conference. At 8-8!"
3) "Did you know that they were outscored by their opponents 309-390?"
4) "Pittsburgh outscored their opponents 325-227. Great defense."
5) "Tebow doesn't have a prayer of winning, about the same as (fill in name) has in Iowa." Two quips in one line.
6) If challenged re the Steeler's injuries, say "When the going gets tough, the tough get going. Big Ben is the man."

I think I may have help for CoinToss this week. The secret code is CHDNANPD/HT. We will see if my quest, with the help of another A2Ker, works out.

Johnboy's picks-
Bengals (25-16)
Saints (34-22)
Giants (25-20)
Steelers (28-8)
 
 
I am pleased today to welcome a very special guest flipper to help me select the winning teams in this week's wild card games.
Lady Diane and Dys were a couple of very early joiners to A2K. Johnboy was about #200 back in late 2002 and Dys came on days later.
Johnboy joined them in Albuquerque for a gathering a few years ago. A lot of us got to meet them.
Lady Diane flips the coin four times and the NFL winners will be-
Cincinnati Bengals
New Orleans Saints
New York Giants
Pittsburgh Steelers

(Thanks to Osso for doing the effort to collect the picks and get Diane's permission to use her name.)
 
 
@Coin-Toss,

hi Lady Di! Nice flipping-picking, too!

Speaking of which, here's my Play-offs Picks:

Sat 1/7, early
Bengals @ Texans
21 - 14

Sat., late
Lions @ Saints
30 - 17

Sun., 1/8, early afternoon:
Falcons @ Giants
24 - 21

Sun., late afternoon:
Steelers @ Broncos Steelers lost Mendenhall but Broncs can't score against Steeler's D
31 - 10
 
 
@Ragman,

I have the same picks, so I laughed when coin-toss got the same - haven't decided the scores yet.
 
 
Packers.

That is all.

(Yes I know they have a first-round bye, this is my way of both bookmarking and saying I will be only minimally participating, as in my vote is Packers ftw and won't really be doing anything else.)
 
 
@sozobe,

Putting Soz's post in context. She is not dissing the concept of this thread but rather a response to an invite to her from me to play. No problem.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

That wasn't dissing, no, but it's not related to an invite either. (I was invited to the Pickum game, not this one, when I was especially busy -- still busy now but a notch down from insanely busy, whew.)
 
 
Watercooler trash talk for Wednesday. January 4th:
"Ndamukong Suh plays with passion but very little class."
He plays defense for the Detroit Lions. He strutted around Sunday after sacking the 2nd string Green Bay QB as if it was the greatest play ever.
A few weeks ago, after he tackled the ball carrier, he stomped on the guy's arm.
The Lions face the New Orleans Saints this weekend. If they win, they will again face the Packers in Green Bay.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Hi all, it is an honor to be one of the coin tossers, although I have no idea on which team is the best bet.

Hi Ragman.
 
 
@Diane,

I think you got a lucky coin. You've got that flip down!
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Not a whole lot o' Tebow-love here.
 
 
@George,

Looks like a big dose of realism from here.....
 
 
@George,

Wild Card 1:

Cincinnati Bengals @ Houston Texans 28-27
Detroit Lions @ New Orleans Saints 41-32
Atlanta Falcons @ NY Giants 31-28
Pittsburgh Steelers @ Denver Broncos 31-9
 
 
I am going to start nagging pretty soon. Or perhaps not.
A2K does not, I guess, have a lot of NFL followers. We are, perhaps, at our max at around 20-25 players willing to invest a mere 5 minutes to participate. So it goes.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Houston Texans (10-6) : 14-13
New Orleans Saints (13-3): 31-14
Atlanta Falcons (10-6): 21-6
Pittsburgh Steelers (12-4): 42-10
 
 
@tsarstepan,

Yay, Tsar, glad to see you. Too bad you're wrong..
 
 
@ossobuco,

My guesses ARE SO WRONG they circumnavigated the predictions globe where my answers are NOW ACTUALLY the correct ones!

Try to trash talk me wills ya Osso!  
 
 
Houston 21 – 17

Atlanta Falcons (10-6) @ NY Giants (9-7) 27-17
Pittsburgh Steelers (12-4) @ Denver Broncos (8-8) 14-3
 
 
@tsarstepan,

Ok, I'll work on it..
 
 
AndyClubber joins the chorus-
Cincy (28-14)
New Orleans (48-21)
Giants (21-17)
Pitts (24-3)

18 players in thus far with 50 hours left until kickoff.
 
 
Feel free to skip over this post. It is just about how the scoring will work.
There are 4 games (8 teams) in the wildcard round. Two points will be awarded to every player who makes a correct pick in those games.
The Divisional games will consist of 4 games (8 teams). 3 points for correctly picking games there.
The next week (Conference games) will feature 2 games (4 teams). We will award players who pick the winners 4 points for a correct choice.
Finally, on Super Bowl Sunday, there will be just 1 game and players still with a chance of winning will get 6 points for a correct pick.
I asked for the final scores in this weekend's games. 1 point will be awarded to the player closest to the winning team's score. If there is a tie we will give the point to whomever is closest to the losing team's score. And, if need be, the player closest to the total number of points.
If there is still a tie, each player still in contention will get a point.
I warned you that you should not bother reading this, didn't I?
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Yes you did. But I read it anyway. Very interesting too.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Cool rules..
 
 
@realjohnboy,

good work. that will make it fun.

So for gerins...is there no picking ahead part? Such as attempting to guess the final 2 contesting teams from the current stage, right?

If there is/was, I'd pick San Francisco and Baltimore. Why? 'Cause I'm nucking futs!
 
 
@Ragman,

This week we are just picking the wild card games.
But then, after Sunday, we will pick all the way through in just ONE SITTING.
The reason for this is that the matchups are too vague until after this week.
Where are Rhys, JPB, Mysteryman, Tico, Edgar and Wandeljw?
 
 
@edgarblythe,

 
Texans 23 - 20
Saints 36 - 17
Giants 32 - 20
Steelers 38 - 10

 

Something wrong?
 
 
@edgarblythe,

No, Johnboy was just wondering where you are.......
 
 
@edgarblythe,

He was just doing his usual herding.

Edgar made his picks a few days ago. I neglected to write them down.
Rhys chimed in via email last evening:
Cincy (17-14)
New Orleans (24-10)
Atlanta (24-14)
Pittsburgh (31-20) -he concedes that 51 total may be much too high.

Pit 20-10
 
 
@thack45,

Thanks, thack, for joining in. We have gotten several new players. That is good. I still need picks from the regular players plus, of course, we always welcome newbies.
Today has turned out to be a rough day for me. I hope that tomorrow and Sunday will give me time to sort stuff out.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

sorry to see that. Hope tomorrow is a brighter day.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Listening. Not to be nosy.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Sorry to hear that, rjb. Let me know if you need help with tallying this weekend's games.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
So we are going to start with the four wild card games to be played on Saturday, Jan 7th and Sunday the 8th. The deadline for all 4 picks is around 4:30 ET on Saturday.
Please also include guesses as to the final scores.

That is about 2 hours from now. There is still time to join in!

23 players in for the wild card games that begin in a few minutes with the Bengals @ Houston.
That game is turning out to be a tossup here with 12 of us thinking Houston will win.
Still a few minutes for last minute picks.
AndyClubber and I were talking about the "average" final score in NFL games. Neither of us had any idea.
I do note that in our projected final scores in this afternoon's game, we have the "average" (mean, median and mode) for the winning team as being right around 24. The projected losing team comes in at about 16 or 17. The mode is 13.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

texans are up 17-10, at the 1/2...
 
 
@Region Philbis,

Cripes!! A female commentator has popped up. We get it a lot but I thought you Yanks could resist it like our cricket is managing to do.

One has to wonder whether that famous American institution known as the "casting couch" has anything to do with it. Cricketers are noted for their aesthetic sensibilities regarding that sort of thing.
 
 
@spendius,

American Football had a female commentator in 1975. Nothing new in that.
 
 
31-10 Houston over Cincy. 12 of us (you, actually) each get 2 points. You get to wear one of those paste on green stars on your forehead to the office or classroom on Monday.
AndyClubber and Osso had the winning team scoring 28 points. Andy had the losing team at 14 vs Osso picking 27. Andy picks up one point there. He had Cincy so it is not all that great of a start for him.
On average, we thought the score would be 22-16.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Coming up next is the Lions battling the Saints. Only Soupkitchen, whom only some of you all know, has Detroit.
We predict, on average, a final score of 33-22. A bit more offense than in the 1st game.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I picked the Saints but I'm for Detroit.
So it goes..
 
 
@spendius,

...Sorry?

The term "casting couch" may be of american origin, but to believe that it is an american institution - or that nowhere else in the world do people whore themselves out like americans - would be about as ridiculous as thinking that the NFL has only recently employed female commentators. And 'round here, cricketers are rarely noted.

Sorry
 
 
@realjohnboy,

green stars for everyone!

 
 
 
Who dat, baybee!!!!!
 
 
Good morning-
New Orleans set some sort of record for something last night. I haven't tried to find out what that was about.
The Saints clubbed the baby Lions 45-28. 21 of 22 players here had that game correct. There are 12 players with 4 points each as a result of picking Houston and New Orleans.
And then there is AndyClubber who wrongly chose Cincy. He is also at 4 points due to coming closest in the "final score" thing in both games, narrowly beating out Parados in the night game.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
New Orleans broke the postseason mark for total yards with 626, beating the record set 49 years ago.
 

 
Brees hit on 33 of 43 passes while throwing for the most yards (466) in a regulation playoff game.
 

 
The teams combined for 1,083 yards, tying an NFL playoff record set by Buffalo and Miami on Dec. 30, 1995.
 
 (espn) 
 
 
The early game today, the Falcons @ the Giants finds us split 15-9 in favor of the home team.
By whatever average we use the final score will be around 24-17.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Manning is smelling the rare air of the Super Bowl. Let's see how the rest of the team responds.
 
 
Atlanta Falcons: 2
 
 
@realjohnboy,

two run shot to deep right?
 
 
@Rockhead,

Jeez, Giants look like the team that went to SB against the Pats. This changes things for predicting what team to put stock into. Giants look unstoppable against Falcons. Let's see how they look next week. Who would they face?
 
 
@Ragman,

Green Bay, I think.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Yep.
 
 
Seven players have each scored 6 points thus far. Many others are at 4. George, wrong in two games, managed to come closest to predicting Atlanta's score in the tiebreaker. He is at 3 points.
Four players have each managed to garner just 2 points.
 
 
We are split 22-2 in favor of the Steelers. Liontamerx and Mysteryman are the outliers. On average, we see the result as being about 26-11.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Bringing out some chicken wings

 
 
 
@ossobuco,

Hmmm, maybe my guess of Pitt getting 31 points was too low..
 
 
@ossobuco,

I have never liked chicken wings. A lot of effort for little reward.
But I do admire the chicken industry for creating a market for them.
 
 
@ossobuco,

Some nice carciofi alla romana, so right for January..

 

I love these artichokes with garlic, mint, and olive oil, but artichokes cost an arm and a leg here..
 
 
@realjohnboy,

So what would you like instead? <passes the napkins>
 
 
@ossobuco,

Oh, good grief, what has happened when I haven't been watching?
 
 
Tebow got his mojo back.
 
 
@edgarblythe,

This is a team (Broncos) and guy that you can never predict.

Steelers are rolling right now but the half is ending...this looks like a GAME again!
 
 
@Ragman,

What does this mean? (I've wondered for a while, never looked it up).
I watch games on a small field (2" x 6") with a bunch of arrows moving around, spare commentary, and lunkheads on the comments section that bounces around endlessly...

"(10:57) (Shotgun) B.Roethlisberger scrambles right tackle to DEN 19 for 9 yards."

He scrambles to his right, toward Pitt's right tackle, or to his left, to Broncos' right tackle?
 
 
@ossobuco,

I think it means he scrambles to his (Ben's) right.
 
 
@Ragman,

Thanks...
 
 
23 - 23
 
 
OT overtime
 
 
@edgarblythe,

oooof...
 
 
@Rockhead,

This one will be secondguessed.
 
 
@ossobuco,

Tebow, Tebow, Tebow!

Actually, you could yell, Thomas, Thomas, Thomas. He was the hero!

I'd have bet the house (if I had one) on the Steelers.

Wait..they're facing Pats next week! Arggh...
 
 
Would someone attempt to justify the Steelers not being allowed a turn at a possession?

I might be suffering from a bad case of fair play but why a great game can be ruined by the rules when the solution is so simple and obvious, indeed applies in the case of a field goal, I'm at a loss to understand.

Also--on a 3rd down and long from own 30 isn't a hold foul encouraged because the defence will decline the penalty to force the punt and there's a chance it will not be seen.
 
 
@spendius,

dunno, but big ben blew it big time in regulation.
they kept saying how calm he was.
maybe too calm -- no sense of urgency...
 
 
It was a sight to see the CBS crew all holding their heads in their hands, after Tebow threw the winning touchdown. Of course, it was staged and funny as hell, but the game made them all eat crow, I think.
 
 
@spendius,

The rule was established to eliminate the situation where the team who wins the coin toss only tries to get within field goal range and then gets a quick win on a fg. A td was deemed sufficient to demonstrate a clear attempt to win it outright.
 
 
@JPB,

FYI, prior to this year there was no such situation as overtime in the playoffs. A potential tie would be settled with a FG - a very unsatisfying end. This end result is due to the new rule. JPB explained the rest.
 
 
@edgarblythe,

yeah...it was high drama for sure.
 
 
@Ragman,

The rule was in place last year but there were no ot games in the post season last year.
 
 
@JPB,

that's right. this year was the first situation that presented itself.

This is a review of the rules in concise words with an in-depth explanation:

"The new rules state that both teams get opportunities for possessions in overtime if the first possession doesn't end in a touchdown, either offensive or defensive.

In other words, if the first team to possess the ball gets just a field goal, the other team has a chance to tie the score with a field goal of their own, or win with a touchdown. If the second team cannot match the points put up by the first team, however, the game is over.

If both teams fail to score, or both teams make field goals, it is sudden death once again. First team to score wins."
 
 
@Ragman,

The obvious solution is like our penalty shoot out. The two kicking teams come out. One kick each from the 30. Proceeding to the 35, the 40 and so on until a decision is reached.

I would be concerned about demonstrations if the home team lost like the Steelers did.

And for ed to say it was staged and funny as hell really ought to get him banned from this thread. Translated into English it means we all all mugs. And ed is a genius. And then he objects strenuously to Christian theology which is definitely staged and quite funny at times.

 
The rule was established to eliminate the situation where the team who wins the coin toss only tries to get within field goal range and then gets a quick win on a fg. A td was deemed sufficient to demonstrate a clear attempt to win it outright.
 

That's no answer.

Imagine the Superbowl being decided like that game was. No wonder the world rejects NFL. Imagine losing your house on it. It's as if the administrators don't give a damn about fans, teams or betting punters. How out of date can they get?

We don't much like the penalty shoot out but the fans accept it with fairly good grace. It is an equal contest. We used to have 15 minutes each way extra time and if still a tie a replay. But the logistics of the modern game made it increasingly difficult.

The recent points decision against Amir Khan suggests your sports administrators think of themselves as gods.

A lock-in is called for. If I had played for the Broncos I would have thought it a hollow win.

The rules of sport need to be framed to take account of the most unlikely event taking place in a high intensity game. Do we really want a Superbowl settled like that. It's bringing the game into disrepute imo.
 
 
@spendius,

With no demonstrations by the home team fans after losing like the Steelers lost suggests that their enthusiasm is faked. That they are a studio audience and can be relied upon to behave like sheep in a queue to be dipped.
 
 
@spendius,

As is typical you misunderstood that reason why Ed was saying something was staged. On the telecast that was on CBS (network TV) the announcers put their head in their hands as a mock gesture.

What color is the sky in your world? The world is far from rejecting the NFL. Guess again, as they're making more money and profits than ever before. In your UK they've imported imported the games. Hell Brits even wear NFL jerseys. Nice try!
 
 
@Ragman,

They are having a long debate here about whether to stage a second NFL game at Wembley. The experts, as I understood them when I watched some of the debate, expressed concern that the one game sold out on the novelty value and a second game would not sell out.

An annual NFL game at Wembley attracts the fashionable set who just want to be present for the cachet and to draw attention to themselves. Once. Most of them don't know what it is they are watching.

Real fans are not like that.

There has been talk of basing a franchise in London.

A few people here do go about with NFL shirts and other Yank logos but it's just a pose. An affectation. I daresay some Yanks wear various European insignia for similar reasons.

Banks were "making more money and profits than ever before" in 2008.
 
 
@spendius,

In a one minute interview after the Manchester United/Manchester City game yesterday Wayne Rooney scratched his face, his ears, his neck and his hair a total of 19 times. Like a tic almost.

Anybody who has played strenuously for 90 odd minutes in a game like that, as Rooney had done, knows very well that the skin of the head continually pricks for a period of time. It must be a biological effect. A reflex.

I saw a pretty lady interview a QB after an NFL game last week, they are shoving their noses in everywhere now, just the pretty ones, and he never scratched his head once. In fact he looked like he had just come out of session in a beauty parlour.
 
 
@spendius,

NFL has already HAD at least 2 games in Wembley, have they not? I know they had at least one pre-season game...perhaps it's now up to 3 games?

Acceptance is acceptance (measured in either $ or Pound Sterling). Whether or not their 'real' fans is irrelavant. Who cares if they are dedicated followers of fashion? Those hoi-polloi or well-healed pay for expensive tickets and that shows NFL has a viable product in UK-land. Wave your hands and obfuscate if you must - the bottom line is about profit is being made and the NFL product is taking its market spot.

@spendius,

october 2011

"ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. -- NFL commissioner Roger Goodell is interested in adding a second regular-season game in London and says the move will be discussed at the owners meetings this week.

"It's been tremendously successful," Goodell said before the Buffalo Bills' game against the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday. "Fan reaction has been overwhelmingly positive, and we want to build on that."

The commissioner said the league was happy with the game it played in Mexico City in 2005 -- the first regular-season game outside the United States -- but noted the NFL is focusing on adding a regular-season game in England.

The league played its first regular-season game in London in 2007 when the New York Giants defeated the Miami Dolphins 13-10. Since then, there have been three other annual games played at Wembley Stadium, and on Oct. 23 the Tampa Bay Buccaneers will take on the Chicago Bears in the English capital.
 
 
@Ragman,

I'm a purist Raggie. Money is the root of all evil.

Had the banks a viable product in 2008?

WWW is a viable product and that's a joke however skilful it is. Turnips are a viable product. You're obfusticating using expressions like "viable product". Have you seen the accounts of the last Wembley NFL game? It was a gig. The idea that it might become a national cherished institution is laughable.

As long as it's just an annual society jamboree for the chattering classes, a jape really, a trip to London, it will escape scrutiny by those who might see its growth as reducing their own cash flows.

Just watch the buggers go to work if the threat became serious.
 
 
@spendius,

What is the relevance here to anything discussed?
 
 
@spendius,

Nowhere did I say or even imply "it might become a national cherished institution".

IMHO, I think you couldn't stay on point even if you had a GPS. You keep wanting to continue to debate about soccer vs American football and I'm not into your debate.

The simple point is that NFL and NFL merchandise is a money-maker in UK and is gaining popularity - not losing it.
 
 
@Ragman,

 
What is the relevance here to anything discussed?
 

Sophistical amusement. What else? Philosopher king shit.

A cursory examination of the difference between an entity created on a sheet of paper and one that evolved. NFL is a hybrid of rugby with a forward pass, platoons of players and expensive kit.

Rugby was created too. Thomas Arnold, the headmaster of Rugby School, a shitbag in other words, needed more efficient use of the limited space of his playing fields on games afternoons. With rugby he could get 30 kids on the mudpan as most of the game was a heap of players.

I like NFL. In fact I like a bunch of guys trying to beat another bunch of guys at anything provided they mean it.

What Plato would have made of a helicopter shot of a stadium and its surroundings during a night game is anybody's guess.
 
 
@spendius,

What's the point to that as many of these team games are creations and re-creations and/or copy-cats of one another. Baseball, when it came across the pond with the colonists has been reputed to be a variant of Rounders. And the point of that is...? "

American, or grid-iron football, is akin to a war game of territorial... land or goal acquisition. Yes...there's a relationship and a roots tracing to early rugby or 'association' football. All team sports games had to have roots from something that preceded it. The fact remains that in North America this brand of football caught on well with the North American public when the forward pass was allowed.

If Plato were found inside a helicopter he'd mostly likely wonder what the hell he is doing in the belly of a noisy metal "Bird" and wonder when he's going to be someone's lunch? After all, his reference point might be the stadiums where Christians and lions met up. - gladiators getting ready to becom lion sized snacks.
 
 
Good afternoon. We made it through the wild card games; many of us bruised up a bit.
Only Liontamerx and Mysteryman had the Denver Tebows. Andy attributes the outcome more to Pittsburgh playing badly than the Broncos doing exceptionally well. He makes no excuses about the Steelers' injuries being a factor.
The final score was 29-23. Johnboy predicted the winning team would score 28 points. He wins 1 point, joining George who got a point for being closest in the Giants' game and Andy who was closest in the other two games.
Liontamerx finished 4-0 in the wild card games - corralling 8 points. At 6 points are Thack, Mis Cowdoc, Andy, McGentrix, Edgar and Mysteryman. Johnboy has 5. Eleven players came in at 4 points. George is at 3 points followed at 2 points for Rhys, SoupKitchen, Rockhead and Parados.
CoinToss and the best ESPN guy have 4 points while the worst ESPN guy has 2 points.

I am tweeking the rules a bit as we now pick through to the end; choosing winners in games that pit teams which supposedly are more evenly matched (i.e. closer to being tossups).
The tiebreaker thing will still award 1 point to the player who is closest to the winning team's score but there will be a 2 point bonus if the player also picked the winning team to actually win.

I will have the schedule for the rest of the way posted shortly. Remember you have to pick to the end in one sitting.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Thanks, Johnboy.
 
 
Okay. Here is my draft attempt at the brackets. Please hold off on posting picks until someone can verify that this is correct. Perhaps someone has a format that is easier to use. I think this is relatively painless but I am coming up with who the home teams will be on the 21st.

@Ragman,

Basically Ragman NFL derives from the Eton wall game and rendered spectator friendly. Marketed in other words.

From the evidence of my eyes I would say that the marketing has been successful because it concentrated on certain basic features of the barbarian temperament. The main ones being, according to the experts, predation by force and cunning, systems of mastery and subservience, devout observances and sports and which not a few claim to be signs of arrested development.

The success is objective evidence of the depth of these temperamental proclivities in any given population and any such success in England will signify a drift into barbarianism.

The trouble is that the cunning aspects of the predatory drive upfield necessitates the use of a ball which is not photogenic. Only last week I saw a player stopped inches from a touchdown who turned out not to have the ball. The ball was in the corner in the hands of a chap doing a war dance in the endzone and grinning sheepishly. If the defense didn't know who had the ball what chance the spectators?

We have a white ball especially so that everybody in the stadium and at home can see it and follow its every movement. Football fans here would not be content to sit through 90 odd minutes bellowing at the top of their lungs and waving a rag around not knowing where the ball is. They want to "Whhoooo" and "Aahhhh" at every significant move it makes. Your stadia sound like a giant electricity generator. Ours are more the soughing of the waves.

Big time modern sport succeeds by what atavistic traits it tickles. I bet if you compared the sound frequencies of the voices in NFL commentaries with those of the average man they would be in a lower register, larger cojones, and the words chosen and inflected to get closer to growling.

Whether it is over-compensation, at the harmless level, for the ongoing feminisation of society I am undecided about. From other things they say they seem like pussycats albeit big ones.

@CowDoc,

I need a score for Baltimore, Cowdoc. And I need scores from Jespah.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Me thinks Jespah meant every score to be the same, including the SBowl, 17-10 or whatever she said.
 
 
@ossobuco,

Oh? That went over my head. Duly noted.
 
 
@ossobuco,

Yep, that.
 
 
@jespah,

Did some more NFL coaches get fired today? How many are we up to?
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Not sure if it was yesterday or today but coach Jackson of Raiders went bu-bye. Raiders appointed as GM Reggie McKenzie.

A bunch of asst coaches were hired.

Ryan Grigson (formerly with Iggles) was hired for Indy Colts GM. Jim Caldwell is still coach, so far. By March 8th, Colts have to decide on whether or not to give Peyton $28 M bonus and/or draft QB Luck. Talk about needing to hit the ground running

@Ragman,

I'm considering Chapstick as an alternative.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I'm mixed about Hue Jackson. He was intemperate, in contrast to the guy across the bridge, but I'm not clear he's not a good future coach. May not be, expresses frustrations to press, against both the players and the organization. I can see his point, but he's missing a synapse on personnel acumen.
 
 
@ossobuco,

agreed. what a press conference that last one was.

I am ready for some football.
 
 
The Ravens/Texans game will face the likelihood of flurries. I picked the Texans to win out of sentiment, but I do wish/hope they can pull it off.

What about me? Why am I not getting nagged after playing for the entire season? And I am not doing half bad, don't you know (as they might say in Minnesota).
Did you know (I bet you didn't) that the U.S. Treasury says that many more of my fellow coins came out of the closet this past holiday season; out of the piggy banks and into the economy. Banks returned excess coins at a much higher rate then usual.
Where was I? Oh, yes. Football games. What is going on there with me?
 
 
@Coin-Toss,

Some gave me a 2 Euro coin as change the other day. It's close to the size and weight of a toonie, but not quite.

If no one else has a good coin to use, I can loan out, heck, I can donate, my 2 Euro coin to the tossing cause.
 
 
I have an invite out to someone most of yall on A2K know and is either online or has been online very recently (hours).
It is a bit of a tough sell, asking them to flip a coin numerous times without a lot of explanation as to why they should do that. I often drop in your names, for better or for worse, to try to make them feel more comfortable about playing along.

I totally support this.
 
 
Good afternoon. 24 hours until the next round of handegg. I am still looking for picks from Mysteryman, Tico, Rockhead, EhBeth. Fbaezer, Thack and Soupkitchen.
CoinToss tells me this afternoon that we have successfully rounded up a celebrity picker. I asked CT to hold off posting until I clarified whether it was all right to use the picker's name. That just came in.
CT expresses disappointment about not being eligible to get any points for predicting the final scores of the games. Points are awarded for being closest to the actual scores.
I came up with a plan. I need a player here to offer to invest about 3 minutes of coin flipping. Thanks.
 
 
@CowDoc,

Don't know how I left the Ravens' point total off against the Pats. I meant to give them 10.
 
 
Hello to everyone on A2K as we head into the final phase of this game. I wish everyone the best of luck. In my case it is all luck.
Did you know that the U.S. Treasury is reporting that banks sent back to the Fed a record number of surplus coins this holiday season? Piggy banks got raided, evidently. I wonder about my future sometimes.
I am pleased to announce that Johnboy went through his Rolodex and found a celebrity A2Ker to pick for me through the rest of the playoffs.
Joe(tththth)Nation from NYC. Johnboy "met" him a fair number of years ago when Joe, whose name is not Joe, prepared for and ran in the NYC marathon.
Anyway, Joe flipped for me and here are my picks:
San Francisco
New England
Green Bay
Houston

New England
San Francisco

New England
 
 
Packers distraction -
But I will not change my picks.

With the recent news of Green Bay Packers offensive coordinator Michael Philbin's son, Josh Philbin, losing his life this past week, the team as a.....
 
 
Saints 24 49ers 20
Pats 31 Broncos 10
Ravens 27 Texans 13
Packers 27 Giants 24

Pats 27 Ravens 21
Packers 45 Saints 30

Packers 38 Pats 31

They'll all be very fine handegg games!
 
 
This week:
NO 31-21
NE 34-13
Bal 20-16
GB 34-20

Next week:
NE 24-13
GB 45-38

Superbowl:
NE 35-28

Or something
 
 
@thack45,

Thanks, Fbaezer and Thack. We are at 20 players with about two hours left until the deadline. There is still a chance we might hear from Mysteryman, Tico, Rockhead, EhBeth and Soupkitchen.
 
 
@Coin-Toss,

Each player (including me) who correctly picks a winner in this weekend's four games gets awarded 3 points. In addition, the player who comes closest to picking the final scores gets some points. I mused that I wished that I could somehow be included in that aspect of the contest here. Johnboy worked out a scheme to allow me to do that. It is too complicated to explain, but here are my bets for the final scores:

 
San Francisco (42-20)
New England (31-6)
Green Bay (34-20)
Houston (27-24)

New England (37-31)
San Francisco (33-20)

New England (40-30)

 
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I missed that EhBeth. Thanks.
So the first game is New Orleans @ San Francisco. McGentrix is the only player picking the 49er's.
Six of us think the Saints will win the Super Bowl. AndyClubber claims that they can be very good or not so good. They lost last year early on in the playoffs to Seattle, he says. I didn't check to see if that is correct.
The weather today in SF looks great.
 
 
Saturday, Jan 14 :
GAME #1: New Orleans 36–23
GAME #2: Denver 24–21

Sunday, Jan 15 :
GAME #3: Baltimore 27–21
GAME #4: Green Bay 39-21

Sunday, Jan 21 :
GAME #5: Green Bay 40-34
GAME #6: Baltimore 27-21

Super Bowl :
Baltimore 30-27
 
 
So this weekend's handegg will be starting soon.

Putting a pot of soup-to-be on the stove to simmer.
 
 
@ossobuco,

Oh, my. SF up 14-0?
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
 
 
Niner's D is hittin hard  
 
 
Disaster for the Saints so far.
 
 
@ehBeth,

Goooo, SF! (I failed to listen to that bird I mentioned)
 
 
My pop always said, good defenses make good offenses look ugly...

Cycloptichorn
 
 
@Cycloptichorn,

Apparently really good defenses make really good offenses look hideous
 
 
@thack45,

Saints rebound.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I need to stay out of this thread - I like to pause the television so as to avoid suffering idiot commercials, so I'm always behind during sports.
 
 
What a GREAT game. This low scoring 3rd is superb.
 
 
@spendius,

I'm liking it too (or are you kidding?)
 
 
oh, my.
 
 
I'm ready to have stroke number 3. Holy HELL!!!
 
 
Saints lead again.
 
 
Insane !
 
 
DEFENSE!!!!!!
 
 
@JPB,

where?
 
 
@JPB,

I don't think my eyebrows can go up any higher
 
 
@ehBeth,

Yipes x 2

edit, laughs..
 
 
overtime...

nope.

sh*t...
 
 
GRRRRRRRRRoooooooaaaaaaannnnnn......

Good defensive game by the 49ers.
 
 
In the next game, all of us are choosing New England, except for Tico.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

reportedly they have God on their side as well.

a formidable combo, that...
 
 
god is apparently having trouble finding his seat, however...

the devil and Tom Brady are having their way so far.
 
 
@Rockhead,

There's a rumor that God wears Brady Pajamas to bed.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

[dance]

 
McGentrix is the only player picking the 49er's.

 

[/dance]
 
 
@McGentrix,

 
 
 
McGentrix and CoinToss had SF.
Six players had New Orleans winning the Super Bowl: JPB, LiontamerX, AndyClubber, CowDoc, Mis Cowdoc and Coastalrat. So it goes.

Tico gets a couple of points for being closest to the final score.
 
 
@Rockhead,

 
the devil and Tom Brady are having their way so far.

 

just as the ancient texts prophesied...

woe unto the nations who delight in he who is having his way with our lord...
 
 
well...

Timmy has not thrown any interceptions yet.
 
 
Gotta say I'm glad to see Sproles doing so well. I had him on my team one year in fantasy football back when he was in, I think, his first year in San Diego and wasn't used much..
 
 
I'm changing my prediction for this game: Den 13 - NE 105
 
 
@ossobuco,

You've got a good eye for talent, Osso.

Oh...I just have one word to say:

GRONK!

I think Brady with this performance was reminding media with all their frenzy and focus on Tebow that they might be perhaps a bit short-sighted!
 
 
@Ragman,

Not always in the right year...
 
 
@ossobuco,

well, you still saw something good. That is a talent.
 
 
@thack45,

I was thinking 56, but I see that's short sighted.

Does it ever happen in the playoffs that a team is so overwhelming the other team that they rest the bigs and let some others play, say in the last quarter? Or is that insulting?
 
 
@ossobuco,

The owner, Bob Kraft is coming down from the box and suiting up to play QB.
 
 
@ossobuco,

I don't know about that, but I could swear I keep seeing Brady looking at his watch
 
 
@thack45,

he has a date with a super-model (his wife)
 
 
@Ragman,

I think I just saw a photo of her on Huff Post watering a tree in (maybe it was) Nigeria..

I wonder if John Elway is still talking about giving Tebow some pointers on the arm mechanics of passing a football.
 
 
@ossobuco,

Well...there's no hurry on that 'cause he'll be playing QB in another city next year. You heard it here first. But...that's not to blame this loss on Tebow, however.
 
 
@Ragman,

Brady is being traded?
 
 
@Ragman,

 
he has a date with a super-model (his wife)

 

True enough. But I imagined he was at the point of wondering if he'd have time to empty the dishwasher first
 
 
@Ragman,

 
Well...there's no hurry on that 'cause he'll be playing QB in another city next year. You heard it here first. But...that's not to blame this loss on Tebow, however.

 

I think the safer bet would be that Tebow will be playing QB nowhere next year.
 
 
@thack45,

You never know. My prediction (judging by the look-see trials that washed-up QBs got this last yr (Delhomme), I'd say he'll prob'ly be backing up somewhere...but not starting.
 
 
broncos busted...
 
 
Is there a good reason why these play off games are not 2 leg affairs? It was a bit unfair on the Saints to have to play in such an intimidating atmosphere as they did without the chance of returning the compliment.

The second leg in the Mercedes-Benz Superdome would be a sell out I'm sure. And attract millions of TV viewers.
 
 
@thack45,

 
I like to pause the television so as to avoid suffering idiot commercials...
 

If we all did that the bloody games wouldn't be on TV and possibly not even played. You're the idiot thack. Too clever by half.
 
 
@spendius,

Oh I never suggested we all use DVR... now go on back to your animated lizards, Mike Rowe selling you a piece of crap chevy, and the foray of junk food possibilities
 
 
@thack45,

You promoted the idea as clever. And it's stupid. Do what you want but don't promote it.

What's your alternative to junk food? Or motor cars?

The ads define those who watch the games. And pretty classy works of art most of them are.
 
 
@thack45,

I'm a little slow sometimes but I didn't make the association so it took me awhile to figure that Mike Rowe was the same one is the one from the Discovery Channel's program "The Dirty Jobs".
 
 
@thack45,

it's even better the way i do it, don't watch the game at all, just check the scores the next morning, no annoying commercials or game play to spoil my fun
 
 
@djjd62,

You missed that great game the 49ers won. You poor sod.

I didn't see the other because it was late here when it started. I saw the first drive touchdown and then drifted off. I had been up since half past ten.
 
 
@spendius,

never watched an entire football game (of any kind) in my entire life

rarely watch any sports on tv, if i'm going to sit in front of the tv i'd rather watch something interesting, all the highlights show up on the news and endless blather from radio folks the next few days

i do enjoy the odd live sporting event
 
 
@djjd62,

But an NFL game, especially one like that, is very interesting. Most of the other gear on TV is edited, scripted, rehearsed and wangled all to fuck and hardly interesting because of that.

Nobody would watch NFL if it was edited, scripted, rehearsed and wangled all to fuck. It is its not being that makes it interesting.

Try a $100 a point score difference bet and a six pack. You probably would use the ad breaks to restore blinking.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
Tico gets a couple of points for being closest to the final score.
 

Woo hoo!
 
 
@spendius,

truth be told, i've never had an interest in sports, not even as a kid, much prefer a book or some talk show on the radio
 
 
Passing out snacks (breakfast-type) while awaiting the current standings.
 
 
As most here know, I only watch the games on a small graphic field with arrows going back and forth and a game log underneath that, scoring details below that, and insult making dunderheads blogging in real time below that.

The good part is that I can click on to any of the games that are happening around the same time, so sometimes I watch, say, four more or less at once. No commercials since I half-mute the sound on my computer. I don't see the players playing, but I've watched enough football to visualize a lot of the plays described.

So, what? So I thought the Saints-49ers game was pretty well played by both, given the other team each of them was dealing with. It was absolutely not a dull game, in contrast to the game to follow, which ran on my screen like frozen taffy. It set me up for a good night's sleep, it did.

On commercials, I'm one who actually looks at websites that show all of the superbowl commercials, since I like good ones as a kind of art. But, on my computer, if I am watching my little game graphic on one window, and a2k or a news site, etc., on another, and some blog on another, I'll be reading along on one of those alternate windows and suddenly get shot, yes shot, by the sounds of a commercial on the sports window that sits behind the one I'm reading. Sudden intense volume, phooey on that.
 
 
@ossobuco,

The 49ers-Saints game had the most drama of any game I've watched this year. Perhaps the Broncos-Steelers last week was a fun game with lots of drama and that surprise ending - but this ganme was loaded 'til the end. I hope you get a chance to see the replay of this game in its entirety on cable (NFL channel or the like.) You will not be disappointed.

Seeing Vernon Davis interviewed afterwards was awesome - considering how far he had progressed maturity-wise and performing-wise... after the problems he had last year with their previous coach.
 
 
@Ragman,

No cable here..

On Vernon Davis, I remember reading that he was considered as maturing a lot before last year, probably written by a columnist or two in the Chronicle. Maybe acted up last year, I don't remember, but there was a lot going on there over the season to act up about so it's possible I'd be on his side.
 
 
@ossobuco,

When in the last season when Singletary was coach and they started off 0-5 Singletary had his infamous tantrum on-camera tirade and called out Davis with..."can't win with him" and "not a winner"...etc. His work ethic and maturity was questioned.

This is why after the game they showed on camera Davis overflowing with the emotion of a man that had arrived. Harbaugh hugged him and whispered in his ear right after the game ended as he knew how much the achievement meant to him and his team after Singletary singling him out so publicly and harshly.
 
 
@Ragman,

I think that was over Vernon Davis having a negative take on Michael Crabtree at the time. I think (not sure and don't want to chase it down) that Davis was a team leader around that time, and there were questions then re Crabtree and work ethic. But I also remember reading that Davis did later straighten up his behavior in any case. This is all vaporous since I started to look all this up and my computer did a flop (my imac wars with a flash plug in). Besides, time to go to the store.
 
 
@ossobuco,

being your a west-coaster and closer to the team's intricacies and the local media etc...I have to claim at least partial ignorance on the details. I just know Singletary was calling someone out..who I THOUGHT was Davis not being a winner.
 
 
Hi. I did see a bit of the video from the end of the SF game. The last 2 minutes of play was evidently awesome. I, like Osso, tend to follow the progress of games by watching the possession arrows on my computer.
McGentrix now has 12 points followed by 11 for LiontamerX. 9-9-9 shows up on my scorecard a lot. CoinToss is at 10.
McGentrix (+CT) was the only player picking San Francisco and Tico alone chose Denver.
Today, we are all over Baltimore and Green Bay. Jespah, JPB, Edgar and McGentrix pick the banged up Houston team and only AndyClubber and Coastalrat are going with the NY Giants.
 
 
@ossobuco,

 
... time to go to the store.

 

I went to Kroger this morning. I tend to do that on Sunday mornings. Very few people there at 8 am and some perishable stuff is marked down.
I noted that, at my Kroger, they have switched from plastic bags which hold about three items to large double hulled paper ones. Nice, although the bagger was mid-way up on the learning curve on making sure the bags didn't get too heavy for scrawny old people.

An emplyee of the grocery store where I shop told me they are trained to overload the paper bags, unless requested to desist by the customer.
 
 
@edgarblythe,

So I'm baaaaak. The grocery store was fun. As I walked in I saw a bagger wearing a Brady shirt (or whatever you call them, big and baggy). As I left, a checker was wearing a Packers shirt. She was happy for me when I mentioned being glad about the 49'ers...

I went to autozone for some new windshield wipers, which the store fellow put on for me, and good thing too as they turned out to be hard to change. During all that we talked this and that, my asking about the store crew since they're so helpful, with him telling me about his baking cookies for the crew, and just before I left, he said he was going to two Packers parties later today.
 
 
I believe if the Texans had Schaub in the game, they might be winning. Still, I am proud of their efforts, mostly.
 
 
McGentrix stumbles with his pick of Houston. LiontamerX is back in the lead with 14.
I have run into a bit of a problem with the awarding of a point or two for being closest to the final score in the Baltimore-Houston game. 20-13 was the final.
Thack predicted 20-16 while Coastalrat and Cowdoc said 20-10. They all had Baltimore to win. My rules for breaking ties do not go deep enough to solve this so I am giving each of them two points. That means that Thack is tied with LiontamerX at 14.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Giants in the lead

 
 
 
@ehBeth,

20-10 Giants at the half.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

twenty where I live, two...
 
 
I was going to post earlier that the bird was peeping again, but I decided to shut up, no chance for change of pick anyway.

C'mon, you guys..
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
That means that Thack is tied with LiontamerX at 14.

 

Woohoo! 14!

... wait...
 
 
@thack45,

Compared with running at full speed along the very edge of the out-of-bounds line with two burly grunts clawing at you and catching a too high, funny shaped, greasy ball, in the outstretched fingers of your fully extended arms and getting the damn thing into the last bit of the corner of the end zone taking a cameraman, the marker cone and a couple of cheerleaders along in a rolling mass of human flesh 14 is fuck all thack.

Thanks for the permission to do as I want. Very sweet of you

By the way - I would've replied earlier, but I had to go make the money I pay my cable provider in exchange for the opportunity they give me to record, skip and/or rewind the programming that they provide to me.

And so I'm guessing that television makes more money off me than you (unless you really are an idiot), so save your fallacious reasonings. Seems to me what you're really worried about is if most people were actually using - and consequently "promoting" paid DVR service, it would only be cheap ass wanks like you who wouldn't be watching these games.
 
 
The Giants picked a peck of pickled Packers.
 
 
Moving right along...
there is blood on the highway as the Packers fall to the Giants. Only AndyClubber and Coastalrat saw that happening.
Eight of us had Green Bay winning the Super Bowl, but now join the six on the bench who picked the Saints. Seven of us have the Patriots while Tico alone has the Baltimore Ravens.
 
 
Edgar got a point in the NYG-Green Bay scoring thing.
I have AndyClubber leading with 15 points followed by Thack and LiontamerX at 14. Coastalrat and Ragman are at 13.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Drama ensues.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

hey I actually scored a point or two, albeit in a losing cause:
Houst Texans @ Balt Ravens
21 - 14

Pretty close. Not that it matters a lot now - especially with GB Packers getting knocked out.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
Seven of us have the Patriots while Tico alone has the Baltimore Ravens.
 

I like my chances.
 
 
@jespah,

Eek - just putting this here for my own amusement.

 
Saturday, Jan 14th-
GAME #1 (4:30 pm ET)- New Orleans @ San Francisco NO Eek
GAME #2 (8:00)- Denver @ New England NE Yay!
Sunday, Jan 15th-
GAME #3 (1:30)- Houston @ Baltimore HOU Eek
GAME #4 (4:30)- New York Giants @ Green Bay GB Eek

Sunday, Jan 21st-
GAME #5- Pick between your choice to win GAMES #1 and #4 GB No longer possible
GAME #6- Pick between your choice to win GAMES #2 and #3 NE Could happen
SuperBowl Sunday-
GAME #7- Pick between your choice to win GAME # 5 and GAME #6 NE Could happen

There only possible score is 17-10. Could happen

Thank you.
 

I'm guessing I'm not the only one out there with a set of predictions that looks kinda like this. How many people (if any) still have all of the 4 (Patriots, Giants, Niners and Ravens) of the last teams in contention for their last 4? How many have 3? 2? Or does everybody just have 1 team left, like I do?
 
 
@Ticomaya,

What's your explanation Tico of why these play-offs are not home and away games. It would be fairer and it would make a lot of money surely.
 
 
@jespah,

I have 2 eeks (Saints and Packers) and 2 yays (Patriots and Ravens).
 
 
@thack45,

i actually enjoy sports talk, one of my fave radio shows has quite a bit of football talk, their friday broadcast had a guy on making perdictions for the weekend games, he did pretty good, but he said that denver would win on the weekend but not go to the superbowl (he did get that part right   )

i end up knowing a little bit about it without having to watch (it's the same for 99% of tv shows, don't watch them, but if you listen to talk radio you're gonna know about them)
 
 
@George,

RP has the same eek to yay ratio as you, and regarding the same teams.
 
 
Well, we made it through the weekend. A bit the worse for wear. We had 22 players who picked through to the end. 7 players chose New England to win the Super Bowl: George, Rhys, Jespah, Region (all from Boston), McGentrix, Tsarstephen and Thack. CoinToss, also. Only Tico picked Baltimore.
The rest of us selected Green Bay or New Orleans, so we will be watching from the bench.
Thus far the maximum number of points a player could get is 32 by my reckoning.* The points is the goal in this game and there are a maximum of 20 points still available.*
I have AndyClubber at 15 points. He is out of the hunt for the Super Bowl but has Baltimore next weekend. LiontamerX and Thack are at 14 and have New England vs the Ravens on Sunday @ 3 ET. Ragman and Coastalrat have 13 points and the Patriots and Ravens, respectively. Tsarstephen, Mis Cowdoc, Cowdoc, Ehbeth, McGentrix have 12 points followed by JohnBoy @ 11. Osso, Spendius, Region, and Fbaezer are at 10. George and Edgar have 9 while Jespah and Parados have 8. JPB is at 7 along with Jespah. Tico, who joined after the Wild Card games, has 5. CoinToss has 10 points.
I am reasonably confident about the scores but let me know if you think I have gotten something wrong.
*2 points for each correct pick in the 4 Wild Card games + 1 point for being closest to a winning team's score.
3 points for a correct pick in the 4 Divisional games + 1 point for being closest to a winning team's score + 1 bonus point for being closest to the winning team's score and having picked that team to win.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I could be totally wrong, but I think you said you gave CoastalRat and me each two points from the Baltimore game. Are they included?
 
 
@CowDoc,

The score card keeping is complex. I have you as getting 4 points in the wild card games (2 correct picks) + 3 points for picking Baltimore and New England + 2 points for being closest in choosing Baltimore = 12. Am I wrong?
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Sounds right. I was confused because I thought the Miz and I picked the same way, which meant the totals should have been different due to the Ravens score. As I said, I could be totally wrong.
 
 
@CowDoc,

I have Mis C going 3 for 4 in the Wild Card games.

The best ESPN is doing well with 16 points while the worst has 7.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Okay, rjb - that makes more sense now. Thanks again!
 
 
The early weather forecasts look good.
Baltimore @ New England...3 pm ET 1/22: Mostly cloudy and 36 degrees
NY Giants @ San Francisco...3:30 PT 1/22: Chance of rain and 52 degrees
 
 
Ragman, on the Vernon Davis history of behavior, we were both right but you were more right - Singletary's rant was earlier in the course of events than the Davis/Crabtree stuff. Singletary not being exemplary himself, of course.
You may have seen this writeup -

game day -- FINALLY !
this has been the longest week in the History of Weeks...
 
 
@Region Philbis,

sure seems that way. To me it seemed more like 2 weeks.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Weather here is good, too, rjb....25 degrees and partly clear as I head off to spend the morning in the corral. Hope to be home at least before halftime in Foxboro.
 
 
@Region Philbis,

Good morning! Finally, we get to play some football. What does the weather look like in Foxboro? I see it listed as partly sunny with temps in the mid 20 degrees. Any snow on the ground?
 
 
@realjohnboy,

we had 4" in brighton yesterday... not sure how much foxboro got.
high today ~ 30°F.
the playing field and stands will be completely devoid of the white-shite by kick-off...
 
 
@Region Philbis,

I found my NFL scorecard buried under a pile of papers about political stuff.
It is snowing hard right now in Virginia, but it isn't sticking to the roads. We had some sleet and freezing rain (I have never understood the difference) Saturday that have turned the deciduous trees silvery white. Eerie looking.
So today we have Baltimore @ New England at 3ET followed by the NY Giants @ San Francisco at 6:30.
The latter game is of no import here. No one saw those two getting this far. The Boston gang (George, Rhys, Jespah and Region) are joined by McGentrix, Tsarstepan and Thack in picking the Patriots. Tico has the Ravens.
The winner(s) get 4 points plus there are an additional 1 or 2 points up for grabs for being closest to the final score.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I may have gotten ahead of myself. I will have to rework my scorecard.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
Tico has the Ravens.

 

me too (why? I can't answer that)
 
 
@ehBeth,

I got confused - which happens a lot to me lately.* All of us are out on the SF-NYG game but all of us have the opportunity to score on the Balt-NE game.
*I drove to the shop this morning to set up the registers for Andyclubber. I took along a box of trash to put in the dumpster. It was snowing. I set a bank bag on top of the trash. In it were my driver's license, credit cards etc. It all went into the dumpster. I drove home and realized my mistake and was able to retrieve the bag.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I also picked the Pats.

Whew..lucky you found the trash bag before the trashmen did.
 
 
@Ragman,

5 of us have the Ravens. 17 others say "nevermore" - going for the Patriots.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

3-3 just after the start of the 2nd quarter.
 
 
13-10 Pats at half time. The Ravens, playing against a weaker defense, need to get going.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

surprised the pates didn't let brady go for it with 2 time-outs in his back pocket just before half-time...
 
 
good first half of football.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
It was snowing.

 

that explains everything

snow makes many of us do unusual things
 
 
@JPB,

Mmmmm, getting interesting. I'm starting to consider the possibility of a double Harbaugh game in the future..
 
 
@ossobuco,

ouch, re the field goal..
 
 
wide left !
 
 
@Region Philbis,

What a way to end it!
 
 
Laces... OUT!!!... NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!

 
 
 
I'm still stunned.
 
 
I have Thack and Liontamerx tied at 18 points, followed by Ragman at 17.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

If you had designed NFL rules John the fucking stadia would be empty.

Wow!! What a pair of games!
 
 
@Ticomaya,

 
What on earth are you bitching about now?

 

this is highly speculative, but he may merely be pouting because the guy that put him in check - more than once in this thread - is (news to him) kicking ass in the a2k playoff pick-um
 
 
@thack45,

I was merely trying to point out that if you organised this game in an office full of dizzy broads at $10 a pop, weekly, you could clean up. It would be handbag rifling.

farmerman came on a long while ago to point out the problem. He was obviously right.

I did a post about a couple at the races to clarify the matter.

It's daft giving a point for every Packer's win and a picker of the Chiefs in the one Packer's loss gets only one point for an 8-1 punt.

With that there's no incentive to look anywhere else than the betting market for guidance. And then every player ends up equal top.

In the keen competition for the horseracing Tipster of the Season in the UK the result is determined by the amount won betting on his "Nap" selection each day and not on the number of winners he picks. If it was the latter they would all be picking the hotpots.

My two Pick-um titles were due to my taking advantage of the ladies on here in that way and taking advantage of ladies is not my style. I hope nobody thought it was because I was an expert on the NFL.
 
 
 

laces out...

Hysterical and so apropos!
 
 
@spendius,

 
... I hope nobody thought it was because I was an expert on the NFL.
 

Rest assured.
 
 
@Ragman,

Simply to make the point I intend next season, if permitted, to try to get below Coin Toss and Jespah in the final standings. That is just as easy in the present format as being top as long as nobody else tries to compete. Easier probably.

For example--C/T is statistically likely to have picked the Packers half of the time whereas I would pick against them on every game. If I remember correctly they were 15-1. So just on the Packers I would be about 7 behind CT. Another 6 with the Pats.

One thing you all ought to bear in mind is that you cannot say anything about me which lowers my self-esteem any lower than it already is. I'm a scientist for Gawd's sake. What scientist could have any illusions about his self-esteem?
 
 
@spendius,

My comment was directed to the 3 Stooges Field Goal kicking demo posted by RP. Sometimes things written here are NOT about you.
 
 
@Ticomaya,

...but laces are supposed to be out or towards the goal posts. When they showed the kick in replay, they were facing generally the right way...or am I wrong?
 
 
@Ragman,

It's a habit of mine Raggie to only use the "reply to all" function when there is a reason for doing so. I generally reply to the last poster partly because it saves a bit of scrolling and partly because I think it looks snooty to not do. Like pointedly ignoring the last contributor to a conversation invariably does.

I'm sorry if I confused you.

I might say that the number of successful place kicks in NFL is highly commendable and points to a very high degree of skill in the unit involved.

The point at issue is where does rjb's game go now that a number of players have sussed out the method I used to win the title twice and for which I claim no credit.

As farmerman said, a version of the spread should be brought into our deliberations. I have my own ideas and if anybody wishes to know what they are they need only ask and I am happy if they are revised by anybody with better ones. The sole objective being an improved game bearing in mind that calculating the standings can't be allowed to take up too much of rjb's precious time.
 
 
@spendius,

I think the way the playoff contest was set up was just fine. The intent here seems to be to encourage a CASUAL friendly competition. You seem to want one that has a different more serious orientation.

If you don't enjoy the rules as they were constructed, why participate? I see no one else concerned about them except you.

Constructive suggestion: Create your own next year and set it up the way you want.
 
 
@Ragman,

You might "see" nobody else concerned about this but the majority have not shown their hand.

The play off contest has resulted in only a few of us having an interest in the Superbowl from a partisan point of view.

If it's a casual friendly competition (a contradiction in terms) you want you can't possibly be a real NFL fan. Such a thing, the contradiction notwithstanding, patronises the footballers. Competitions are serious or they are nothing.

And you forget farmerman's interjection. You just want to protect rjb and I can assure you he doesn't need it.

I just want to tweak his game. I have no intention of starting one of my own.

It is quite possible that the "worst" ESPN guy won more money backing his selections than the "best" one did. Being best or worst under rjb's rules is circular. Winning money is scientific. We know who is best then. The American way. I'm more American than most on this site.

So now you know you're not into science eh?
 
 
When it comes to JRB's NFL"pick 'em" games, I am a lady, Spendius, and I expect to be treated like one!
 
 
@Ragman,

I read a bit ago that Cuddiff was rushed (though the writer said he could have called a timeout). Naturally, I forget the source of that.
 
 
My scorecard shows Thack at 18 points and picking the Patriots next week (by a final score of 35-28). LiontamerX is also at 18 followed by Ragman at 17 but they do not have a team in the Super Bowl. McGentrix is at 16 and has NE (34-24) while Tsarstepen is also at 16 and has NE (38-21).
George, Rhys, Region, Jespah have the Patriots but are too far back in the standings to have a chance of winning.
My intention when I set up the awarding of 1 or 2 points for predicting the final score of a game required a player to have at least 1 or 2 teams on the field.
CoinToss also has NE (40-30) but is also too far back.

Gargamel on another thread notes that in only 27 days pitchers and catchers report to training camp. Where's my glove?
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I'm not sure whether or not you meant to write this exactly but I DO have one team in the SB - the Pats; however, I don't have the Pats as the winner as I chose GB Packers as winner.
 
 
@Ragman,

Bad wording on my part. You along some others (including, most notably, Lion who has NE but picked NO in the Super Bowl) may have NE playing, but picked someone else to win. No one has the Giants. That means that you could add to your 17 points if the final score you picked (34-31) is closest but you won't catch Thack.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Meantime the superbowl has lost some luster for me (I'll still follow it and this thread) because midway through all this I turned out to be rooting for Baltimore and SF.. sob.

But tis matchup is one I am very excited about.
And very worried about.

I looked at the line this AM and it's Patriots, giving away 3.
I thought the Giants would be favored, given recent performances.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Do I get any points for being a lifelong Giants fan ? Not that I really need any. I'm positively dumbstruck that they have gotten this far.

I've no idea... I was providing light banter by quoting from "Ace Ventura." The "Nooooooooo" part was not to say the laces were not out, but that the kick was missed.

@LionTamerX,

at 9-7, they were fortunate to nab a wild-card...
 
 
I did a makeover of my scorecard. Somehow the scoring process seemed to end up looking 3-dimensional.
7 players have New England not only playing in the Super Bowl but winning it:
George (who has earned 13 points thus far, Rhys (12), Jespah (11), Region (14),
McGentrix (16), Tsarstepan (16) and Thack (18). If those players are correct they will each get 6 points plus those players could get 1 or 2 more points if their picks of the final score are among the closest to the final score.

10 players have New England in the Super Bowl but have another team (New Orleans or Green Bay) winning:
Osso (14), Spendius (14), JPB (11), Edgar (13), Ragman (17), Liontamerx (18),
Cowdoc (16), Mis Cowdoc (16), Coastalrat (14) and Parados (12).
They could pick up a point or two based on the final score.

6 players are on the bench with no team in the Super Bowl:
JohnBoy (11), Mysteryman (6), Tico (5), Ehbeth (13), AndyClubber (15) and Fbaezer (14).
They are done. Toast. Kaput.
 
 
@Region Philbis,

But look what they've done since.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Next Year in Marienbad for some of us. (er, that's an old movie reference)
 
 
So, what do we got? We have almost 2 weeks to kill before the Super Bowl. And then this thread, like Brigadoon, will disappear.
Perhaps it will come back next year with the start of another regular season.
It was conceived (not by me, by the way) 6 or so years ago as a mindless game for people with little knowledge of football to get together. Sometimes players had sharp disagreements on other issues but those had to be set aside here and going off topic with recipes or whatever was welcomed.
Rule #1 is that it be very simple to play over 17 weeks.

We keep score of correct vs incorrect picks and we tabulate the standings, knowing that there are players who will never ever pick against the Patriots or Steelers or for a team from NY, for example.
The standings thus become largely irrelevant. With that in mind the rule maker never gets upset if someone misses a game or even a weeks' games.
Rule #2 is that the rule maker gets to make up rules.

In the playoffs I asked for suggestions on the scoring and got no responses. I am pretty happy with how it has turned out even though half of the brackets have been broken. 7 players have the chance to prance around screaming "We are #1." Ten other players have a team in the Super Bowl.
As for the points each player get, we will see.

I am open to hearing how the game could be structured in the future.
 
 
Just to let any Giants' fans know:

 
The Patriots will spank [the New York Giants].
 

Elizabeth Warren, US Senate candidate for MA on last night's The Daily Show.

Well, there you have it. Game over! The future has spoken!
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
They are done. Toast. Kaput.
 

I'm not catching your drift... do I have a shot or not?
 
 
@Ragman,

 
NP. Gotchya! I couldn't see your expression.
 

I'm going to have to start using more emoticons just for you, RM.    
 
 
@realjohnboy,

If it is a mindless game for those with little knowledge of football then it doesn't matter what the rules are. It becomes like playing snooker with ladies.

But some of us don't play like that in this game. If we should "lighten up" then there are easier ways on A2K to do that.

I think the spread should be used as farmerman suggested.

e.g. Giants v Patriots (-3). If Pats win by 3 or more Pats win. If they win by less than 3 Giants win for this game.

For those playing mindlessly it doesn't matter anyway and for those playing to win it is fairer.

It adds an extra bit of work for you John but it isn't a lot. George will tell you where to look for guidance on what the spreads should be.

Such a rule allows players to miss out games or even weeks.

And it also allows OT to be ignored. The 90 minute score being the one that counts. e.g. if SB goes to OT then Giants (+3) have won for our purposes.

Tie breaker--total points scored in all the weeks games. A second tie breaker the total points scored by home teams.

You could use the odds rather than spreads if you want a game that delays the onset of brain degeneration assuming mental cruddling achieves that desired outcome.

To provide me with a team to shout for in the SB I'm going to have a bet on the Giants.

Thanks for enriching my life Johnnie. NFL was a blank I should never have allowed.

I'll rewrite the rules for American football sometime. Two leagues. 16 teams in each. Home and away. Premiership and First Division. Top 2 in First Division get promoted and bottom 2 in Premiership get demoted. Bottom 2 in First Division have to stand for re-election against applicants from elsewhere. As it is it looks like an aristocracy. Which is un-American. No draft. A transfer market. Talent scouts. Bungs. General cunning and more sex scandals. 30 minutes OT. Then field goal shoot outs.

Superbowl a separate knockout comp with the 16 Premiership teams. Two leg ties. Who plays who drawn out of a hat. No warmed balls.

Prize money. Sleazier cheer leaders. Shorter holidays.

See baseball off.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
I am open to hearing how the game could be structured in the future.

 

"If you build it, they will come..."

You make good games Johnboy. Keep at it and the rest shall follow. Just don't let Spendius and his pub betting get to you. I prefer keeping the spread out of it. Then it becomes a gamblers game instead of a fun game.
 
 
@McGentrix,

The last thing I want is to be dealing with point spreads, or making RJB, a gracious volunteer, spend a lot of time doing so, either.
 
 
@McGentrix,

I agree.
I've no interest in participating in any game that is based on spreads OR odds. Nor would I want to make the game ANY more complicated so the administration of the game becomes more work intensive. I see no reason to change much in this game as it's fun this way. There are plenty of other venues for other types of more competitive games
 
 
@McGentrix,

following McG down the road of "you make good games Johnboy".
 
 
@ehBeth,

+1(or 2, as the case may be).

I did the tracking for rjb one year and I know it's not mindless or minimal time. I appreciate everything he's done in pulling these games together every year. He's asked for input on changes, but I think he's done a mighty fine job already.
 
 
 
 
 
Adding another NO to changing this game to involve the spread, and another boost re Realjohnboy's handling of the game. Thank you, RJB.
 
 
Sheesh!! If it's mindless and just "good fun" what's the point? Why have a winner every week if we are not to want to win? Why have a standings table?

This is very interesting actually. On one level it shows what an American education lasting many years and costing a fortune can achieve in some cases.

It also shows how a handful of people, 5 is it out of 20 odd, can make the running on a thread. As is the case on the evolution threads.

 
. Just don't let Spendius and his pub betting get to you. I prefer keeping the spread out of it. Then it becomes a gamblers game instead of a fun game.
 

That is not true. spendi's pub betting has nothing to do with the arguments I put forward to improve the game. It is a non sequitur. The arguments stand alone. And rjb doesn't need any advice about what to do or not to do. Or support. He is no bleating furry animal with a thorn in his paw. He's nearly as bad as I am.

It is necessarily a gambling game I'm afraid. With pride instead of cash as the prize. And the goofers off are good for a laugh. OK. I'm up for that. But the scrap at the top of the table has to be serious to some extent.

Preferring to keep the spread out of it needs to be justified. I prefer to keep the spread out of it. That's why I didn't comment on what farmerman had said.

I know all this. I'll confess. George sussed me out. As had farmerman early on. I just took the favourite in every game from off the bookie's web sites for my back-to-back title victories. I had been playing a few weeks before I discovered what a 1st down was. I couldn't go wrong playing against 20 odd people who thought they were better judges than bookies. I know bookies. They put their money where their mouth is and there is a mass of hungry jackals sniffing at it.

And rjb had asked for suggestions possibly due to him understanding from some previous posts of mine why the game needed improving. And I accept whatever he decides.

We could all make our selections using a coin. But would we trust each other. Who is going to pick-um the Packers opponents if the coin says they should. It's fair though if we could trust each other. Could we put everybody on their word of honour that they had not consulted the bookies?

And the spread is very little extra effort. All rjb has to do is correct the final list of winning franchises, it's an odd word that in sport, it jarred my sensibilities the first time I heard it, to take account of it. Statistically, half the games (8) will have a different result for us than from the actual results. And those corrected results are the ones the bookies pay out on. He then proceeds as he does now. 5 minutes extra--tops.

I came to these conclusions as a result of becoming ashamed of having won my back-to-back titles using such a cheap, underhanded trick as I felt I had done on some good folks who are no all that conversant with bookies and betting because various degrees of prohibition of gambling exist in their culture and it is an activity generally looked down upon by well brought up citizens. Except of course when $2 million is bet upon an ad to win 2 points in the opinion polls. It's respectable in that case. But it is gambling. All ads represent a gamble.

And total points scored in the 16 games etc is an efficient tie-breaker and might reduce rjb's efforts by more than the 5 minutes readjusting the results.
 
 
@spendius,

I can't claim to have "sussed" you out. You said what you were going to do
when you first started. You were a bit a oblique about it, but you said you
were going to rely on "the form".
 
 
@George,

I had forgotten George. Thanks for that. I'm not as ashamed now.

There is another trick my suggestions would invalidate. It is the one where somebody a few points in the lead in the standings can pick the same as the nearest rival if he or she waits long enough before entering the lists.

No tricks are any use if spreads are in operation. It wouldn't even be much of a problem if somebody joined in mid-season. If any.

And nobody need be concerned about picking their favourite teams all the time. The bookies have handicapped them to have an equal chance.
 
 
Yet, even with using bookies odds, you still weren't perfect every week Spendius. I don't think anyone has had a perfect week, thus no need to add an additional variable to the game. Perhaps, you can do, as many of us Americans do, play 2 games at the same time! I am in an office pool that every week we bet actual coin on the games using the spread. Yet, I still manage to come here and enjoy making my choices based on win/lose and enjoy the entertainment of playing with my fellow A2Kers and keeping track of who does well and who doesn't. I like seeing my name near the top of the list, or at least above some peoples...

One of the fun things about American Football is that anything can happen on any given Sunday.

Perhaps you should play in Barclays EPL league (  http://fantasy.premierleague.com/  ). I do that and it's s good time. That will give you your soccer fix and the you can still play here using your bookies info to win. I like the challenge of wondering if I will beat you that week.
 
 
@McGentrix,

I'm not talking about a perfect week. The bookies are subject to the bounce of the ball as well. I'm saying that over a season the bookies will likely be more right than anybody else and that with them as a guide you will likely top the standing here playing against people who are using another guide. From a standing start I should have been struggling to beat coin toss.

I only came on to motivate me to have a closer look at American football than I had previously done. I know a lot of people can't be wrong. Bums paying to sit on seats in large numbers always impresses me. You and I would have to pop ping-pong balls out of our backsides into a jam jar 3 times in four to get bums on seats.

I'm an NFL fan. I pester my pals in the pub about it but they don't want to know.

I never make any contact with promotions on TV as a matter of principle.
 
 
@George,

they are playing well now -- when it matters.

interesting factoid...

 
The Giants were outscored through the first 16 games, 400-394, and would become the first team
in NFL history to win a Super Bowl with a negative point differential during the regular season.

Keep a lid on it: IPL manhole covers put in lockdown
Utility completes work to keep lids on 150 Downtown and prevent further explosions

Work is done to keep the lid on exploding manhole covers during the Super Bowl and beyond.

Indianapolis Power & Light Co., which has been bedeviled by one manhole explosion after another
in the past two years, said Thursday it has locked down 150 of its manhole covers Downtown.

That's 50 more locks than IPL said last month it would install.

Fifty are on Georgia Street, where a Super Bowl Village will draw thousands of fans beginning in a
week. Other locks were installed in high-traffic areas near Lucas Oil Stadium and elsewhere.

The locks cost $1,200 each and prevent the steel lids from lifting more than 3 inches in the event
of an explosion.

The last such blast, on Delaware Street in November, heavily damaged a parked car. It was the fourth
launched lid of 2011.

Patriots favored by 3, I hear.
I see rumors of the NFL going to having 13 Thursday night games in the future, up from 8. If so, it would probably mean that the NFL would be on TV at the same time as some college games.
And the NFL is making noises about adding two teams. They really want an LA team but need one more to keep an even number.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
13 Thursday night games in the future, up from 8.
 
these will be on the NFL network, a pay channel that some cable companies do not include in their basic packages.
comcast boston is one of them.
fortunately for us, one of the local networks always works out a deal with the NFL, so we won't miss any patriot games...
 
 
Anyone here? We seem to have a football game scheduled for today; about 6 hours from now.
I found my scoring sheet. It is a bit dusty. Choosing the New England Patriots to win the Super Bowl are Thack (final score: 35-28), Tsarstepan (38-21), McGentrix (34-24), and the Bahstain Mafia: Region (52-48), Jespah (17-10), Rhys (24-20) and George (24-21). CoinToss also has the Pats (40-30).
Despite two excellent QB's, I expect the score to be at the lower end.
GO GIANTS!
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Just saw that the Madden NFL simulation has the Giants, 27-24. Of course, it picked the Steelers last year, and the Pats when they were 18-0, but it's been right as lot more than it's been wrong.

rjb, for this time of year, anything in positive digits is not cold. I've been able to work without a coat for most of the calving season so far. Actually got to correct a 180-degree uterine torsion the other day and pulled the calf live! Theoretically, it's not possible to rotate the entire uterus (with the calf in it, of course) with one arm inside the cow. Glad I've been lifting weights this winter.

I, for one, am glad there is no video of that.
 
 
@CowDoc,

wow the whole uterus. My wife once delivered a lamb that was presented ass first and all tangled in its cord. She has smaller hands and so handled it and delievered the lamb. The mother lived too but only after many bolii were inserted.

My hands are too big and Im not as skilled as she.

I helped deliver cows but we always use these things that look like brake pullers with a bipod that braces up to the cows hindquarters and wed crank.
 
 
@jespah,

Wouldn't be anything to see until we got the calf coming out, jes - everything else happens out of sight.
 
 
@farmerman,

Those are called fetal extractors, farmerman, but everyone I've ever known calls them calf pullers. I use it, too, but the calf has to be straightened out and brought through the cervix before they're of any use.

NY GIANTS ROCK!
 
 
Woo!

Congrats Frank and other Giants fans!

Glad they won. Didn't look very good for a while there, but they did it!
 
 
whoa

 

thank you for hosting us again rjb, and thanks to everyone for another entertaining season

 
 
 
@ehBeth,

Thank you so much, Real John. You are our mench.

Passing you the game ball..
 
 
@ossobuco,

Helluva game, helluva season....you da man, johnboy!
 
 
@farmerman,

 
However Ive set about 50 on the PAts straight up 7 to 5
 

Yeah and you waited for 17-9 before telling us. I won 7 stake points. 4 from the game and 3 because Giants were +3 underdogs.

I think the lad fell ass first into the endzone because he didn't agree with the plan and quite rightly. Get the points on the board. You could miss the field goal. A snap, a catch, a set up and a kick with rushers coming at you is not a cert.

A great game. Congrats to both teams. I was up till 3 am. The Giants were a shade lucky was my impression. Recovering two fumbles and that brilliant catch down the left out of bounds were the hand of fate.

Pity about the half-time show though. Women in England of that age who open their legs provocatively a lot don't wear curtains. Doing so is rather drawing attention to something odd.

Thanks John. And all you lovely players. If you see Panzade pass my best wishes. I was only kidding.
 
 
This has to be the most hesitant Super Bowl-winning touchdown evah:

 

(I get why btw, just funny.)
 
 
@spendius,

No, I said that the ay before that, since the Gints were bet heavily I would go with my money on the Pates.
Oh well, it was only money tthat my kids could have used for beer and ciugarrettes.
 
 
Congrats to NY, and thank you again to RJB.
 
 
@farmerman,

The Patriots were the bookie's favourites right across the board. A commentator referred to the Giants as "underdogs".

As a matter of interest how much does a pint of 3.5% beer and 20 smokes cost in Pa? I remember buying cartons of 10 x 20 Camels for 7s and 6d which is 37.5 pence in new money. About 50 cents. In Aden I think. We spent time in so many countries in the ME that we rarely knew which one we were in.

This is how I would display the games next season--

Giants (+3) Patriots (-3). Players picking the Giants with that score last night would be credited +7 and Patriot pickers -7. That will sort out the players who follow the money and everybody would know what is what. Had the score been 15-17 Giants pickers score +1 and Patriot pickers -1.

For those who watch the games the interest remains until the clock stops even if a team is leading 40-0 at the last 2 minute warning. To save rjb work players could calculate their own score and a designated player appointed to check it like they do in pub quizzes.
 
 
Just wanted to say a quick thanks to RJB for a fun season. Thanks for keeping track of it all.
 
 
@sozobe,

 
This has to be the most hesitant Super Bowl-winning touchdown evah...
 

A tush-down
 
 
I think we are done here. Thanks for the playing and the chatting.
No one picked the Giants. George gets 1 point for being closest to the final score of 24-21. He predicted 21-17.
I have Thack and Liontamerx as finishing with 18 points each. Ragman came in at 17 followed by Tsarstepen, Mr and Mis Cowdoc and McGentrix at 16. Andyclubber had 15 and at 14 were Coastalrat, George, Fbaezer, Region, Spendius and Osso along with CoinToss. Ehbeth and Edgar got 13. Parados and Rhys ended at 12. JPB, Jespah and Johnboy just got 11.
I read the comments on changing the rules. We will revisit that next fall when we decide whether to do this thing again.
I think I just heard the crack of a baseball bat.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I emailed Rhys (who is not on A2K) letting him know how he did. I also asked him to think about being commish on the A2K Fantasy Baseball game.
He replied that he would undertake that and he also added that I should say hi from him to Osso and Rockhead.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Neat! <hi, Rhys!>
 
 
@realjohnboy,

spendi was boasting how he made big bucks by betting the giants. He did pick them the day before on another thread. I also bet like 50 bucks which I shall be proud to donate to the Sicilian cultural association (SCA) get it georgeob?
 
 
@farmerman,

I didnt watch the game I was busy painting my studio walls. Did anyone have any preferences with the commercials? I heard the radio this AM complain about how lame the commercials were. But I think theyre supposed to say that to get the phone lines working
 
 
@farmerman,

Such a great game... full of drama... all the way to the end. Well worth it to see in replay as they replay it in enirety on cable.

Speaking of entertainment value, the avg cost of 60 sec ad commercials was $3.5 M for air time:

Hyundai, Coca-Cola, Skechers and M&M’s commercials score at the 2012
Super Bowl.

MY fave ad:
Skechers (footwear ad) was one of the best, I thought.
Youtube:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTy3bpke74o 

They brought back the Coca-Cola polar bear character and it was pretty cute.

"Hyundai came out on top with its simple, yet memorable Genesis commercial. To demonstrate speed, Hyundai chose a cheetah in this Super Bowl spot. A man pits the speedy animal against a Hyundai Genesis. However, humor comes into play when the cheetah turns on the man after it discovers that the car is faster. The ending was very funny and unexpected. "
 
 
@farmerman,

They were the worst I've seen - you can watch them on Huffington Post.com if you are feeling masochistic at the moment. I liked two or three of sixty six.

The Chevy Truck commercial (the apocalypse or some such idea), the polar bear thing (2 separate commercials) for Pepsi, and something with a dog and a VW that I liked the first part and didn't get the second part and didn't rerun it.

Hmmm, now they're only showing 21 -
 http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/06/best-super-commercials-2012-vote-beckham-mms_n_1256541.html?ref=media&ir=Media 

I figure the commercials are shown on other websites too, just haven't looked that up.

edit, Rags, I remember liking the Sketchers thing, but forget the actual commercial. That's what happens if I watch 66 commercials in a row. Brain fuzz. The Budweiser commercial was elegant to watch but a tad unclear re what Bud Platinum is.
 
 
@ossobuco,

So, this site has them all..

I thought the commercials were pretty lame. I did like the Chevrolet apocalypse one, and the Audi vampire one.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Thanks JohnBoy for plowing this stony field of a game. Your hard work has been appreciated!  
 
 
@tsarstepan,

It's only stony once in a while.
 
 
@farmerman,

NE gets a lot of mileage out of questionable officiating calls but it wasn't enough to save them this time. There was even one 14-point turnaround in which a G-men drive stalled after a bogus holding call on third and one and the spread could easily have been 14 points greater.
 
 
@gungasnake,

That was daylight robbery gunga.
 
 
@spendius,

SO, did you play a spread? or just go even up?
 
 
@farmerman,

I told you--I played the spread. I had 3 start. 3lbs extra a racehorse handicapper was giving the Pats.

We can't handicap football teams by putting lead in their boots. Think how long the weigh-in would take before the result was made official.

So the bookies step in to fill this gap in our scientific endeavours and sound men they all are. They handicap sports teams in the manner they used to handicap sprinters in the famous Powderhall Sprint which is The New Year Sprint, formerly known as the "Powderhall", and is a unique event in the annals of sporting history being the last of the old time pedestrian galas. It has been an annual New Year event since 1870, the heyday of pedestrianism (professional footracing) then the sport of the people. The format remains unchanged. All races are handicapped to ensure close finishes and betting adds to the enjoyment of the spectators. The days of huge betting coups and malpractice are long gone but the tradition, spirit and atmosphere remain. To win the "Big Sprint" remains the dream of all competitors no matter their age or ability.

You would probably be on the 94 metre mark fm. I wouldn't be that much nearer the tape; which is at 110 yards.

They give runners starts. It's common at the dogs but dogs can be handicapped by meat pies as well.

I had 3 stake points banked at the kick-off. After the safety I was winning 5. Then a leap then a trough like on the Big Dipper and by the end I was groaning about the idiotic plan to not to try to score a TD and then that lad Bradshaw said "nope" think of our spread betting fans. So he sat down trying to make it look like he had lost his balance probably thinking that that lot won't get past us in 57 secs. So Mr Bradshaw was my Man of the Match.

It was a pity about the attempt at the 2 point conversion. I expect they were getting a bit leg weary.
 
 
@spendius,

"The days of huge betting coups and malpractice are long gone", is irony.

It is a scientific fact that if men and money in large amounts are brought together they react spontaneously at room temperature to produce malpractice and where possible huge betting coups. And it has the character of a chain reaction.

And it isn't "we" who choose it. It is those of us who have been identified, by an expensive investigation, as likely customers of the products advertised during Superbowl 46. The majority of the total "we" were doing other things. fm was letting us know he has a studio. Geddit?? He's an artist. Oh Aye. (fakes getting grit out of right eye).

Thus the lesser "we", that's us who watched the game, and Madonna's 1920s peekaboo show, were being given a professional opinion of what sort of people we are and of our standing in the general scheme of things.

We are not shown your ads. They either show their own ads up to the maximum time allowed by statute or they cut to Kevin Cable and a couple of ex-NFL players, one of whom doesn't fit on the screen, when your ads run longer, as they do. And judging by the blather Mr Cable's team regales us with, considerably longer.

We like cars. Or we tend to do. We have dough--that's for sure. We like colour and movement. Razzamattazz. Eating. Drinking. Reclining on luxurious sofas. Goofing off. Being cool. Doing our own thing.

It was a religious ceremonial in worship of Mammon.

They have us taped.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Good contest and fun game. Sincere thanks for all your efforts.
