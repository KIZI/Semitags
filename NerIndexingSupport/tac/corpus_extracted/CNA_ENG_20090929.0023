China should not overlook the expectation of Taiwan's people for international
participation if it wants bilateral relations to grow and thrive, Foreign
Affairs Minister Timothy C.T. Yang said Tuesday.

Speaking in an interview with the Central News Agency, Yang, a career diplomat
who assumed the post early this month in a major Cabinet reshuffle, said
President Ma Ying-jeou's modus vivendi policy is aimed at achieving a turnaround
in the diplomatic arena.

Arguing that the previous administration's diplomatic policy had a negative
impact on Taiwan's development and its relations with China and other countries,
Yang said Ma's new flexible and pragmatic diplomatic strategy will usher in a
new era in the country's diplomatic history.

"The modus vivendi policy has allowed us to rebuild trust and strengthen
interaction with our friends, " Yang said, referring to improved relations with
Taiwan's major trade partners, including the United States, following a thaw in
once strained ties with China.

But China's attitude has been slow to change, as Yang illustrated by citing an
incident that occurred earlier this year during his tenure as representative to
Indonesia.

At a public event, Yang was not allowed to sit in a section reserved for members
of the diplomatic corps due to a protest from China's ambassador to Jakarta,
which the diplomat said showed that it may take time for China's grassroots
diplomatic personnel to adjust their conservative traditions and mindset.

"The change in the Beijing leadership's way of thinking probably has not been
fully conveyed to its overseas diplomatic staff, " Yang said. "We need to be
patient in waiting for their adjustment."

He also reminded Chinese leaders that if Beijing wants to enhance the affection
of Taiwan's people for China, it should not disregard their desire for
participation in international activities.

"If Beijing fails to make the necessary adjustment, cross-strait rapprochment
could be limited," Yang said.

Stressing the importance of professionalism in diplomacy, Yang said Taiwan
cannot afford to address issues simply from its own perspective, but should
instead tackle Taiwan's issues from a global perspective.

In his view, Yang believes the government should factor in the general
international perception of Taiwan rather than just focus on the country's own
stance in order to formulate balanced and feasible diplomatic policies or
working strategies.

On diplomatic allies' development of trade and economic ties with China, Yang
said the governemnt will not oppose such activities. But it is another story if
they intend to exchange representative offices with China, he said, adding that
the government will prudently deal with relevant issues.

"We will let our diplomatic allies understand that our modus vivendi policy is
based on pragmatism and will not pursue it at the expense of bilateral ties,"
Yang emphasized.
