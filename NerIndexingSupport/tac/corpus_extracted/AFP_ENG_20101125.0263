All Scottish Premier League matches scheduled for this weekend will go ahead
despite a planned strike by leading Scottish referees after the Scottish
Football Association (SFA) reached agreement with "several European national
associations", the governing body said Thursday.

"The Scottish FA can confirm agreement has been reached with several European
National Associations to ensure matches in the Clydesdale Bank Premier League
and the Alba Cup final will be covered this weekend," the SFA statement said.

It added: "Negotiations are continuing with other national associations to help
ensure that some, if not all, matches in the Scottish Football League go ahead
as normal.

"Clubs will be informed by 3pm today (1500GMT Thursday) whether their matches
will go ahead or not in light of the Scottish Category One referees electing to
persist with their withdrawal of labour."

Scotland's top referees have chosen to strike in protest at what they say is the
"intolerable pressure" placed on their personal and professional lives as a
result of the fall-out from some of their recent on-field decisions.
