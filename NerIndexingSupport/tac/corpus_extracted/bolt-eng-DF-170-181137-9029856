... without Peyton Manning for 2-3 months if not the entire season?

I'm thinking it is going to be a long season for Indianapolis.

Immie
 
 
If Manning is out as long as it sounds like he'll be, I think they will be lucky to go 8-8. They have been TOO reliant on him for years, without a backup they can be confident in and without a strong running game or defense.
 
 
They will suck
 
 
This of course is the talk of the town here in Indy.

Meh, we shall see after the game with Houston on Sunday how Kerry Collins does.

Who knows, the Packers won the Super Bowl last year without Brett Favre!

The Rams won with Kurt Warner, an Arena League QB before playing for the Rams.

So ANYTHING is possible!  
 
 
Middle of the pack.

Damn sure ain't no Eagles!  
 
 
I'd be surprised if the Colts won more than 6 games without Manning.

No football team is more reliant on one player than Indianapolis.

Well, here in Tampa, I think I heard a big sigh of relief when they said Manning was going to be out 2-3 months since the Bucs play Indianapolis in week four.

That's what I have been thinking.

I was on a business trip to Indy a few years back. It was during football season.

They are crazy about the Colts the same way bammers are crazy about the Crimson Tide

I hung out in a sports bar on Thursday night - crazy good times...

That's because we don't have much else for sports here. The Pacers, but they have sucked since Reggie Miller left, though I have high hopes for them this season.

And of course, us Colts fans are spoiled because we are used to winning.

Now there's an optimist.  

PS: Kerry Collins is like 75.  
 
 
Elite teams like the Colts allegedly define success as winning the Super Bowl.

I predict they fail.

I'd have to be some kind of coward to make such a prediction in private, knowing that I could bury it if it doesn't come true. Nope, much more bold and courageous to post it publicly for all to see.

That's just how mani rolls.

But whatcha gonna do?

I think I am going to drop $5 on the Carolina Panthers just for the heck of it.
 
 
I generally do not follow the odds. Anyone know what the odds were on the Colts before yesterday's surgery and the fact that his career may actually be over was announced?

Mannings Neck Surgery Might Put a Crick in His Season, Doctors Say

Indianapolis Colts quarterback Peyton Manning is out of the game after having neck surgery Thursday, his third surgical procedure in the past 19 months. In a statement released Thursday, the team said Manning had a single level anterior fusion procedure, which was uneventful.

...

Dr. Mark Knaub, a spinal surgeon at Penn State Hershey Medical Center, said recovery can take two to four months for someone with an average, non-strenuous job. But for an athlete playing a contact sport such as football, that recovery time can be much longer: up to nine months, in some cases. Knaub said thats because doctors must make sure that the athletes bones have fused.

Sometimes recovery is accelerated in professional athletes, Knaub said. But Id be surprised if Manning made it back to the field this season.

I actually don't expect to see Manning play this year at all. If he is out 2-3 months (or longer) then they could already be out of the playoff hunt before he is ready to play. At that point, it would be stupid to put him in a competitive position this year... of course, Indy could gamble and maybe trade him to a team that was in the hunt... EZ would love that!

Sorry about your QB, EZ...  
 
 
No way in hell they would trade him.
 
 
it depends on which Collins shows up, the one who took the giants to the super bowl, the one that took the titans to the championship game or, the one who flopped for a whole bunch of years.....

Those odds put them in the top 7 AFC teams, which would be pretty good (considering the loss of one of the best players in the game); but would JUST miss the playoffs. A disappointing year in Indy...

I hear Trent Dilfer is available. He's even got a ring. Better yet, Brett Favre.

I don't think so either. It was a just a little ribbing of EZ.

I'm kind of indifferent on the Colts. Don't really care either way, but I don't think they will trade him.

I fear, however, that Peyton's career may be over for good. I wish him a speedy and full recovery and a return to the game in the near future.

It's true he's not so young anymore. This could certainly hasten things in that direction. Probably be just as well for him. He's got plenty of money and can go on making 100 commercials a day for the next 30 years.

Didn't they just sign him for 5 years?

He did just get a big-ass contract recently. Even if this nudges him toward earlier than expected retirement after another 2 seasons or so, the guy is still the second best quarterback in the league and one of the greatest of all time. You don't cut loose that kind of talent without giving him a chance to come back from something like this.

While he may have a lot of money in your (and my eyes), it is sad to see that so many of our fallen sports heroes end up broke and homeless just a few years after retirement. Peyton seems like he has a level head on his shoulders. I hope he can manage his money well.

Although, even if his career is over, I think he has a future in football either as a coach or an announcer/analyst on TV.

He does good things with his money, donates to the places he's lived, New Orleans, Tennessee and Indy. Here, this is one of the things he's done here in Indy.

 Welcome to the Peyton Manning Children 

 

I don't know anything about what he does for the community.

And, I am not talking about those kinds of things. What I am talking about is that they spend too much too fast. They buy expensive houses that they can't afford once they are no longer active with huge mortgages. Once their career is over they find themselves buried in major financial problems with no way out.

He can do all kinds of good things for the community, but once his career is over, if he hasn't planned for the fall, then he may find himself in trouble. Not all of them do, but it is tragic to see the ones that do. I hope he is not one of those.

Now Brett Favre on the other hand...   Nah j/k. Favre was one of those players I loved to "hate".   I wish him the best of luck as well and will miss that damned smile of his on the field.
