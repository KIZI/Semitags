Actually pro football is my second favorite sport, motorsports is my
favorite...but that's not an option on the poll, so put me down for
pro basketball I suppose.

Actually Bobby mine is not up there. For me Aussie Rules is probably
equal first with American Football. Nascar is very close by.

nice look to the site bobby but although i voted for basketball it's
really college as opposed to pros-i have been taking off work for at
least 20  years to watch the 1st round of the tourney in march

I love college basketball myself, but some years I get more into it than
others. :)  I am a Bulls fan and we don't understand ncaa 64

Oh, btw, even though this list has more "restrictions" on what you can
and can not discuss - the forums at our website does not.  So, please
feel free to chat about all sorts of sports on our forums just in the
right area :)

I apologize for that... will try to make the polls more clear and more
"international" too :)  It's my first poll :)

Hey Bobby,

That's cool. It really didn't bug me.
While we are on the subject I'll also throw cricket in there as well.

I often wonder how much you guys over there know about cricket ? It is
kind of like baseball for the uninformed. Just for the record Shaka
and the Capn' are currently in a fantasy cricket league with me. Not
sure how much they know about the game though, !!!!
