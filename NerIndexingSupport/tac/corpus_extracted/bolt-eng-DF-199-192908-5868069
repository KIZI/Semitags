 
 
Official A2K Gathering in Chicago, May 7th, 2006!
 
 
This is the big one, folks! Come one, come all!

What: The Official Able2Know.com Gathering
Where: Chicago, Illinois
When: Saturday, May 7th, 2006

Several months ago, Craven suggested on the Subscriber's Forum that we put together an official A2K gathering. The subscribers discussed possible locations and times at length, and just came to a final conclusion. Now we're opening it up to everyone.

We will be having one major event on Saturday; the exact time and place will be decided and publicized here on this thread. YOU can help decide the venue! We hope to get all of the Chicago locals involved in helping us research and decide, but anyone with Googling skills or past experience in Chicago is welcome to put in your two cents, too.

Beyond the Main Event, we expect that people will be arranging various satellite events -- museums, sports, shopping, etc. Feel free to use this thread to organize those events, (or create spin-off threads), but the focus here will be on the main get-together on Saturday.

It will likely involve food, but other than that we're open to various possibilities.

See you in May!

See:  http://www.able2know.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=67531  <--- please just put vital info there, so that that topic doesn't get too long. Thank you.
 
 
GREAT!!!

Looking now for the best airfares...
 
 
real long shot for me but I'm right now no vacation time - still pricing tickets,
 
 
Yippeee!!!

Now, thinking of food, there's no place like Chicago for gyros - and the heck with New York, real Chicago hot dogs, from a tacky little Vienna Beef stand, complete with greasy fries, are a special treat. Certainly not to be overlooked is deepdish pizza. Lessee here - there's breakfast at a Steak & Egger (the one on Dickens was my fave), and of course, White Castles, with cheese and onions, by the sackful. MMMMMMM.... can't wait.

OK, you folks go ahead and hash things out... I'm gonna go make a sammich now.
 
 
what about the pizza joint? Giardino's? or something like that - it's been awhile.
 
 
Yay!

Remember that this might be REALLY big... we'll see how it develops. But we may have to think much bigger than pizza place, for the main event anyway.

I found this, it's cool but might be scaled more expensive than we can afford:

 http://www.choosechicago.com/makeitchicago/default.html 

Personally, I love the idea of meeting at some cool historical building of some kind or another (OK, it doesn't have to be historical as long as it's cool) and have it catered. Doesn't necessarily have to be expensive, and allows for multi-use of one facility.

Could also rent a room or a whole food place, but that gets pricey, too.

Options galore!

Depends a great deal on how many people are interested, of course.
 
 
There's that big yacht that just sits there at the Navy Pier, seemingly unused.

Couldn't we use that? Sneak on or something?
 
 
HOOOORAAAAH!!!! rah rah! I shall be there! awesome. timber, you want real viennese hot dogs? i can bring you some from here. They are truly to die for. Or at least to injure a small insignificant animal... no no. I would possibly kill a fly for one though.

chicago, chicago, i've been there once. i had dinner at Sushi Samba Rio, but that was almost $100 per person - so that don't seem like a good meeting place (albeit it is ultimately cool). Where are Chicagoans? Sublime? Cynesthesia? Zane? Joefromchicago? Who else?

Hooray again!
 
 
Yayyyyyyy!

I vote for the basement of  St.Helen's orphanage . That way we'd be on a mission from god, and we could even invite Jake and Elwood for the music.
 
 
Are you coming, Gus?
osso? bbb? y'all will be there?

now...what to wear...hmmm.
 
 
Maybe I could go. Is it in America?

(Hey, yurpeans are not guaranteed to get through Immigration, these days. Let's not count our turkeys)
 
 
Starting my diet tomorrow...

(kidding, I never diet).

Yes, I plan to.

I just looked up train fare with a roomette as it's a one day trip each way from Albuquerque - $952.
Forget that...
A regular coach seat - yikes, 24 hours - would be $220.

Of course I can fly, but I love trains and was thinking about trying it.
 
 
Flights okay - looking now for a hotel...
 
 
Oh, and I must get a passport - we have those new digital now already.
 
 
The sell beer in Chicago right???  
 
 
loads of beer. better than in boston! come! come along!

walter, what's a digital passport? will it be screened on one's forehead or sumtin?
 
 
Thinking about it. I know nothing about Chicago. Where is the area where most people would stay? Downtown? Where IS downtown?
 
 
I'm going to be a street bum if I come.
 
 
I think I'm washing my hair that week.
 
 
May is too far away - I'll bookmark first
 
 
we can gang up and share rooms to cut costs. which may result in a lot more fun and possibly a few divorces.....
 
 
It would be nice if everyone could stay at the same hotel. I can just imagine the ruckus it would cause!  
 
 
The Palmer House Hilton? Sigh, maybe not.
Even with a group rate, which we should get - thus the same hotel is a great idea- it would be around $150 or more. might be worth it, as it's a beautiful hotel, but a little over my budget, i think.

 
 
 
$ 150/night for a city like Chicago is not bad. If you share
your room with littlek, then you'll pay only $ 75.00 dagmar.
Don't share with Slappy, he'll give you either an IOY or is
offering sexual favors in return.
 
 
Yeh, I loved the Palmer House when I was a kid.

<washing yer hair, by then it'll need it>

I looked at packages for both the loop and the river/whatchacallit area to include both flight and hotel. Staring at the Seneca.. and the Congress. (I'm in thrift mode). The Best Western is relatively inexpensive, doesn't attract ms. picky.

but I want to go look at small boutique places sans the amenities, perhaps further north. If I get a list of some, perhaps a Chicagoan can advise if I've picked something on Skid Row.

I managed to click off Expedia just after it loaded all hotels in all areas (took a while, I went to the grocery store while I was waiting). Sheesh.

Now to check out hotels.com

First I'll try to find some maps.
 
 
There are a lot of cheaper hotels in the suburbs, easy access by train to downtown. The suburb I know is Naperville which is on the high end of affordability, but hotel fares there are still very reasonable (compared to $150, anyway...)
 
 
I don't know about renting a place to meet, Soz. Expensive enough for some of us to get and stay there.
 
 
Oh, I know. I'd only want to do it if it were cost-effective -- which it definitely can end up being. Like $10-25 for the whole event per person.

Really depends on how many people (more = cheaper per person), but I've done this kind of thing before.
 
 
I lost my map links - from the Lonely Planet, most useful so far but I've barely started looking - but got these from the ad on the page...
mention them because they were significantly less than my big interest, the Palmer House, at least re a flight hotel combo price on Expedia.

congress plaza

 http://www.crshotels.com/search/hotel_view.asp?HotelId=460 
seneca

(I'm not sharing a room and the Palmer House would be high for me. I'll be glad to visit though.)
 
 
We'll have to see which area folks end up in. I tend to like the Renaissance Chicago myself but it is on the steep end of the scale.

As it is I'll have to figure out if Quinn will go or not. She won't fly so if we do go it'll be a 2 day (long days! lol) drive each way.
 
 
Here's a batch of maps: first one turns out to be least interesting..

 

 

 

 

 
 
 
Already this looks more accessible to me - if not with a riproaring review.

 Days Inn Gold Coast, by Lincoln Park 
 
 
I've just wasted a half hour looking up hotels in Evanston, many of them far far away, with slow loading. I suppose the old Orrington is dead and gone, or nobody ever stays there.

sigh.
 
 
May? MAY?? That's six months away, facrissake! I'll sure try to make it, but I wouldn't promise anyone anything six WEEKS in the future. Six days...well, maybe. I'll watch this thread. But I sure ain't making no airline or hotel reservations until sometime after the first of the next year. More likely not until after the Spring Equinox.

Chicago has a number of fine hotels (and some not so fine). I always liked the Omni Ambassador East, home of the Pump Room, the bar that was the "in" place back in the 1940s and '50s. Every movie star, musician and other type clebrity stayed there and the walls are covered with their autographed photos. It hasn't aged all that well but it still has that historical charm. (It's sister house, the Ambassador West, across the street, has been converted to condos and no longer takes transient trade). It;s within walking distance of Lakeshore and the John Hancock Tower and a lot of other places. Probelm is, unlike New York, Chicago's midtown center city section isn't quite as compact. In theory, you could walk from the Palmer House to the Chicago Art Institute but it's quite a trek.

Let's just keep each other posted.
 
 
Oh, cheezits, has that place changed...

barf city.
 
 
In the Frank Lloyd Wright area, Oak Park - rooms from $85 at the Carlton Inn..
 http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review?geo=36471&detail=87941&from=Hotels&inMonth=05/2006&inDay=2&outMonth=05/2006&outDay=8&adults=1&hs=hac4:10023 
 
 
getting more nitty gritty re my own interests...
y'all may not share this, but, just in case

 http://www.oprf.com/hotels/index.html 
 
 
Oak Park could be dicey, Osso. You can sometimes get really great rates at some pretty nice hotels on the weekends.
 
 
I finally nabbed the Carleton, I'd spelled it wrong. The old hotel starts higher, something like 150.

The hotel's motel is much lower (me!), seeming to be c. 85.

This might be a link, or just look up Carleton Hotel Motel on Google and you'll find the tripadvisor site.
 
 
Not to push this over anything else, but I might be staying at a Travel Lodge. But which Travel Lodge...

at 85. I might suck it up.

I sorta remember Oak Park from our driving through it but very slightly. I have no idea what is dicey in one way or another, presume OP is dicey on the upside because of frank.

Re timing, MA, some from Europe need lead time.
 
 
Sorry for the repeats, good grief.

And still no decent link, beg your pardon.

sigh, try this -
 http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g36471-d87941-Reviews-Carleton_Hotel_and_Motor_Inn-Oak_Park_Illinois.html 
 
 
HOORAY! What a great idea! And I've always wanted a good excuse to visit Chicago! (Haven't made it there yet, and where could I possibly find better guides?!)

Let's see. School will still be in session for SonofEva, but maybe I could manage to get away for a couple of days by myself...is this on a weekend?...but would a couple of days be long enough? <thinking, thinking>

This sounds like a can't-miss party.
 
 
Osso--

Try:

 http://snipurl.com/index.php 

You enter a link from the middle of the site and they boil it down to the pertinent bones. Then the bones work.
 
 
I got around it by trying again and again, Noddy, but I'm going to save that link for the next time.

I can look at me as too engaged in this, but it's both fun and serious for myself. The trick is now and will be on this thread, to separate out odd needs like my slight interest in FLW plus inexpensive place... and our paying attention to what most want. If we do both of these, we may have a main place and satellites....
 
 
Count me in!

If we settle on a hotel, we might be able to get a group rate as well as use their meeting room for free or at a discount anyway... and we'll have more time together if we're staying at the same place as well.

I seem to have no time to spare lately, so thanks for doing all the research, osso.
 
 
From my experience at booking mourners for family funerals, even three rooms qualifies you for a bit of a discount.

Of course, I've never accommodated Visiting Firemen in a Big City.

Still....
 
 
VERY good point about group rate/ meeting rooms, mac.
 
 
Just a thought - room rates in the O'Hare (airport)/NorthWest Suburban region are gonna be on average a lot less than downtown - more of 'em, too. Mass transit to downtown abounds, and even rental car charges prolly wouldn't be out of line compared to a downtown (Loop or near environs) hotel room. In Chicago proper, further out from downtown, (but go North), reasonable room rates are readily had - the major; Holiday Inns, TraveLodges, etc, and the like), and mass transit to-and-from the downtown/Near North is fine, affordable, and eminently accessible.

I'll admit none of this is a factor for me; I'll stay at a relative's. Prolly borrow their car, too. Ain't picked one yet, but I've a broad assortment from which to choose.
 
 
Having looked over various hotel sites, I noticed that at some nice places I can't book over the complete 4 four days I want to stay there.

So (and since I don't want to spend my time [and money] in busses/trolleys, I've booked the Essex Inn now. (There are surely better places - but since I'm in Essex/UK quite freqently :wink: )
 
 
Did you find that while searching under Chicago *sex* ? :wink:

Had a memorable stay at the Essex - mid '70s, it was. Nice room, 14th or 15th floor, if I recall, fantastic park view with the Lake as a backdrop, and I ran into this this amazingly fit and supple Danish lass... well, nevermind right now. You'll hafta remind me to tell you about it. When the ladies aren't around, you know.
 
 
 
When the ladies aren't around, you know.
 

You mean, when those McTag (perhaps) referred to have left?  
 
 
AHA! This is where you're all hiding is it?

Little known facts and tips regarding Chicago:-

1. It has a lake.

2. It is reasonably windy.

3. Lots of big men in suits walk around with violin cases under their arms.
 
 
what's in the violin cases?
 
 
 
what's in the violin cases?
 

dag- You don't want to know!  
 
 
 
 
 
Since this is secret anymore - we should welcome our members from Chicago with their ideas and comments now :wink:
 
 
Chicago was a secret? S'funny, I learnt about it at school......

I hope that you all have a wonderful time, and not too many of you get arrested.

Alas, I will not be attending, as the possibility of sharing a room with Dag is scaring the life out of me, and my virginity.
 
 
Not Chicago, but what they carry around in those violin cases, was a secret: otherwise someone like Dag would have known it, no?

Dag didn't know about it because she is one of life's innocents.

<chortle>
 
 
But she boxes - that not really a virnal virtue.
 
 
That doesn't mean anything Walter. We all had to wear boxing gloves when we went to bed at Eton, but that was for a totally different reason.
 
 
I do wish you'd come, LordE. Surely Dag won't be the only one looking for a roommate. I might be by myself as well.

I've booked already, and I'm the only one in that king-seize bed (KING, not LORD ) until now...
 
 
It doesn't matter what size of bed I use, Walter. Every time it's the same, I approach the bed and the lady invariably says "Oh Lord"!
 
 
I'm not so religious - "My king" isn't that bad either.
 
 
 
Every time it's the same, I approach the bed and the lady invariably says "Oh Lord"!
 

I need more details, I think. When she says that, does she roll her eyes, or do they bulge out in a surprised, shell-shocked manner? This may significantly influence my decision to come, so please give your response much thought.
 
 
Osso mentioned the Carleton hotel and motel in Oak Park. Both the hotel and motel are only one block away from a CTA train station. The CTA train travels from Oak Park to downtown Chicago in 20 minutes. A train departs every 10 minutes.
 
 
contemplating this.................
 
 
I'm loving the idea of a Bean-Mo-sozlet-Ducklets get-together...
 
 
Oh and Ya-Ya too...
 
 
Bookmarking.
 
 
 

i just glanced at amtrak-
2 adults, one child leaving on the 5th arriving on the 6th... In cabin..
26 hr trip, 218.00$ one way.

hmm

this... MAY be do-able for us..
( crossing fingers )
 
 
So, I'm arriving in Chicago on Thursday evening already.

Might do some sightseeing on Friday on my own - does anyone know the schedule for the Duck Tours?   [sorry, couldn't resist].
 
 
Walter,

I think the Duck Tours leave from Chicago's Navy Pier and are quite enjoyable. (Please explain to Gustav what they are.........he might be dissappointed.)
 
 
 
 
Every time it's the same, I approach the bed and the lady invariably says "Oh Lord"!
 

I need more details, I think. When she says that, does she roll her eyes, or do they bulge out in a surprised, shell-shocked manner? This may significantly influence my decision to come, so please give your response much thought.
 

Fear mixed with wonderment, methinks.
 
 
DUCK TOURS!!!!

S-l-o-w-l-y I turn, step by step, inch by inch................
 
 
I am well aware of the duck tours, wandeljw. I was there last week, afterall. I was unable to work the tour into my schedule, though, because my time was consumed with necrophagia, which was the original purpose of my Chicago trip anyway.
 
 
sorry, gus. i should have known.
 
 
 
DUCK TOURS!!!!

S-l-o-w-l-y I turn, step by step, inch by inch................
 

I mean, it was a very rare ABUZZ-question, isn't it, Phoenix  
 
 
OK, I decided to book and did; through Expedia.com I got a round trip from Albuquerque flight and hotel/4 nights package for 694 at the Travelodge Hotel Downtown - looks to be about five blocks away from Walter's Essex. Ahem, would have been 1564. or somesuch at the Palmer House.

My next possibility had been the Days Inn Goldcoast which is across from Lincoln Park Zoo..

I looked at places twenty miles away from downtown and could get a few lower prices in both Naperville and by O'Hare, but decided I wanted to be near downtown re possible taxi needs at night and so I can take the el to visit Evanston after I've checked in on the day I arrive, Thursday.

Expedia.com for flight-hotel packages or
 http://www.hotel-rates.com/us/illinois/chicago/travelodge-hotel-downtown.html 
 
 
i'm probably going to drop by, barring a howl of protest from other would-be attendees, but there are too many unknowns right now for me to be making any arrangements. anyway, if anyone's tabulating attendance, i'm in until further notice.
 
 
Flights are confirmed now as well: tickets on the way.

well then. let me know if you're coming to chicago - so that i can buy my tickets to chicago or london, accordingly.
 
 
Dare one ask "What time is the Blue Man performance?"
 
 
 http://www.blueman.com/ticketinfo/chicago/index.shtml 

I have never seen them but several friends have and say its an awesome show.

If anyone needs some advice on areas to stay (whats around, good area, bad area ect...) just post and I'll try to help.
 
 
sublime, when I was in Chicago last week, I was pressed for time so I checked into a hotel for the location rather than shopping around for the best buy. I ended up staying at the Best Western Grant Park. Nothing spetacular. When I rolled into town though at 3:00 a.m. the area looked a little questionable and I fingered my knife as I walked down the street, glancing over my shoulder and expecting confrontation at any time.

Was I correct in being cautious? What do you know about that area at 3:00 a.m.?
 
 
There are worse neighborhoods in Chicago to visit at 3:00 AM - in fact there are neighborhoods riskier to visit at 3:00 PM than the Grant Park area at any time. Chicago, like any big city, has neighborhoods fire trucks and ambulances don't venture into alone.

Of course, caution always is advisable, whenever, wherever.
 
 
 
...share rooms to cut costs. which may result in a lot more fun and possibly a few divorces
 

Aren't we all adults? Can't we handle a few indiscretions without resorting to divorce?

syn,

there are technical problems all over A2k today.
 
 
I hadn't noticed. Usually it's just that phpbb connection error, but this was unusual.
 
 
it's all good syn. we're all in the same boat, posting rubbish in quadruples today,ha. it's gonna get fixed.
 
 
I thought I was getting censored for thinking about adultery and fornication.
 
 
i'm getting censored, too. i tried to lure ellpus into my cobweb, and then it all started happening....
is a2k reading our minds now? frightening.
 
 
syn, didn't you have another post here? where did it go? scary stuff!
 
 
If anybody wants to fly into Milwaukee I have a spare bedroom... of course I'd have to check with the Mrs first.

Why don't we look into reserving a spot in a park and getting it catered? Lots of room and we could do it reasonably inexpensively. May in Chicago is a great time to be outdoors.
 
 
Ooh, and there are also park department buildings! In Madison, there is a really cool building that is owned by the Parks Department that can be rented really inexpensively. I bet there's something like that in Chicago. Now I'm gonna go look.

Good idea!
 
 
Whoa. So many options, hard to narrow it down:

 http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/parks.home.cfm 

(I searched by "meeting rooms/ assemby halls".)
 
 
Grant Park - my hotel is just steps away - and which includes an outdoor music pavillion which can accommodate up to 14,000 people. (Well, some of our 48,969 mewmbers might not be able to come   )
 
 
Heh!

It would be cool if we could get something that has indoor facilities, too, though, in case of inclement weather.

Can't quite tell yet if this fits the bill:

 http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/parks.detail/object_id/068C3D93-E5F8-4D02-8767-867161271B8A.cfm 
 
 
And here's a good article in the Boston Globe on Millennial Park, not sure about facilities. Then there's Lincoln Park near the Zoo (I haven't looked that up either.)

 http://www.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/articles/2005/10/30/chicago_hits_this_one_out_of_the_park/?page=full 
 
 
Garfield park looks interesting, too.

I just sent an email to the Chicago Parks District laying out the basic parameters and asking for their advice.
 
 
soz,

I used to live near that park. The park is very nice but the park's indoor facility is old and not in very good condition.

(gus can probably give advice on why indoor facilities are not absolutely necessary)
 
 
perhaps we should just reserve a whole restaurant with catering for sat. afternoon / evening? it still may be cold in may and what if it rains?
 
 
I sent an email to the Chicago Parks people laying out parameters and asking for advice, just got this response:

Thank you for emailing the Chicago Park District. The Park District would love to be a part of your special celebration. Following are some locations to have a wedding, reception, anniversary party, shower, etc., and some ideas of places that can be especially nice for pictures.

Millenium Park is beatiful. It may be to big/expesive for us but they do offer private rentals with a variety of siz/cost options. They even have a list of recommended caterers.

 http://www.millenniumpark.org/ 

Grant Park would be awsome, too. Right near the  Art Institute of Chicago,  the  Field Museum , the  Shedd Aquarium  and all of down town... not to mention the Magnificent Mile for all of you A2K shopaholics.
 
 
That worked! (My "email" posts weren't showing, then when jp posted they showed up.)
 
 
Mine were not showing up either. I had to click on my name to see my recent posts and it showed up there.
 
 
Started by contacting these folks:

 http://www.garfield-conservatory.org/room_rentals_1.htm 

(Millenium Park is PRICEY! Like $10,000 pricey, although one room goes for $2,500 a day.)
 
 
Garfield Park Conservatory would be beautiful, but its not within walking distance of anything. Neither is Lincoln Park for that matter. Grant Park and Millenium Park are right downtown but the cost might be prohibitive.

Sadly, this is the one weekend next spring when I already know I'll be out of town. I'll probably leave on Wednesday and get back late Sunday. If anyone is here early or staying on longer I'd be happy to join in.
 
 
I left my number for a call back on Garfield Park for availability for 5/6/06. Pricing seems reasonable, but its prime wedding season so availability might be a problem.

 http://www.garfieldconservatory.org/gpca_pdf/room_rental_rate_sheet.pdf 

 http://www.garfield-conservatory.org/ 
 
 
I guess that's something to establish -- would it need to be within walking distance of anything? I'm assuming that train and taxi should cover it for people who don't have cars.

Sorry you won't be there, J_B!

A-ha! I found the rental rates for Garfield Park Conservatory and their Community Room is $25/ hour. 3-hour minimum. That's more like it!
 
 
It's pretty bare-bones, though.

This is nice! $1,500 for 7 hours on a Saturday ($15/ person if we get 100 people...)

 

At any rate, from my brief research it looks like there are options up the WAZOO. That's good.

Any recommendations, J_B?
 
 
Shoot... I might be able to find $75 underneath my sofa cushions.

We could also rent a trolley to take us around. It is actually a bus that looks like a trolley but it fits a ton of people, is reasonably priced and allows drinking on board. They will take us just about anywhere and is safe transportation for all.
 
 
It really depends on what you want to do. If you're talking dinner and drinks, all inclusive, or just cocktails, or lunch, etc. The room rental is only the beginning, you also need catering and so on.

I can call around to some of the downtown hotels and see what they have. It would probably be easier to book through a place that has a banquet service so you don't have to cover the individual details (unless you're into covering details).

What should I price and is 100 people a fair guess?
 
 
<maybe people could be encouraged to vote in the poll. there's only 1 possibly showing up right now - according to the poll>
 
 
I'm in on the poll - just now saw it. I'm a "definitely be there" - Good Lord willin' an' the creek don't rise :wink:

Another thought here - haven't explored it - might be practical to reserve open space at a park, then get a commercial tent shelter from a rental outfit; I've done that a few times, though not in Chicago proper. Around here, a 20'X30' tent with banquet tables and seating for about 70 people goes for something like $250 for a deliver-and-set-up Friday/tear-down-and-return Monday weekend - prolly more in Chicago, but mebbe worth looking into. Any Chicago caterer oughtta be able to provide precise details; caterers use rent-a-tents all the time, some even have their own rigs, with better rates than 3rd-party rental vendors when included in a catering package.
 
 
i just voted, too. didn't notice the poll before.
 
 
you think we'll have 100 people? i think more like 30. 40 max.
 
 
 
you think we'll have 100 people? i think more like 30. 40 max.
 

Really? < Might consider cancelling the hotel and flights in that case   >

Honestly, enthusiastically I would even think about a greater number.
In reality, I suppose, 100 is a good figure.
 
 
At this point, I have nooooo idea. I could see it going either way -- 20 or 200.
 
 
Having just voted in the poll, I note that only eight people have voted so far. There're more than eight of us just chatting here. Whazzup, folks?
 
 
I think the poll was added recently.
 
 
I just voted as definite, assuming the creek doesn't rise.
 
 
Depending on the numbers, here's some possible restaurants for Saturday afternoon (some for evening) with outside seating as well as inside.
I suspect Sublime and other Chicagoans can give us more, with preferred Beer Gardens..

I stopped because I thought the last one I found was neat and added it to favorites and lost track of where I was in the Downtown restaurants with Outside Seating review. Will have to start again around restaurant #65..
but here's some so far.

Several of them have private rooms..

 Riva on Navy Pier 

 Navy Pier Beer Garden (all ages welcome, private parties only) 

 Enoteca Roma (you'd figure I'd find this one) 

 212 on the River - Roof garden etc. 

 Athena Greek Restaurant 

 Garden Restaurant at the Art Institute 
Small, but if our numbers are small, a maybe...

 Mellenium Park restaurant 
can be reserved

Haven't finished downtown Loop much less other areas, and was looking mostly for afternoon possibilities. Probably skipped some...

What has occurred to me is we need a fair span of time as people will be late... and we might need to figure some places for later too, in case people get derailed in the afternoon..
 
 
Chicago in May is impossible for me, but I'm getting very envious.
 
 
Looks like I can't spell Millenium..
 
 
I'm getting excited! I'm in as definite - even if the creek does rise.
 
 
mac and osso are both planning on attending? Hmmmm, I might just have to polish up my traveling shoes.
 
 
Gus, if you'll be there, the attendance will automatically double. At least.
 
 
Oooh, did I say I wouldn't room with anyone? <thinking, he probably wouldn't mind snoring>
 
 
 
Gus, if you'll be there, the attendance will automatically double. At least.
 

Or at least double over

Hey, are you coming to the party?   Official A2K Gathering in Chicago, May 6th, 2006!  <--- Click for details

And welcome to A2K.
 
 
<waving!>
 
 
 
I'm getting excited! I'm in as definite - even if the creek does rise.
 

Ditto - especially, since I got the hotel vouchers and flight tickets already  
 
 
 
we can gang up and share rooms to cut costs. which may result in a lot more fun and possibly a few divorces.....
 

Hmmm...
 
 
Thanks to Mac for the link to this.... will try and squeeze the bank account, it sounds a great idea. Last (and only) time I was in Chicago, travelling with husband and 2 children under 4, changing trains between one from Boston and the City of New Orleans, intending to take in the Art Museum in our 3 hour break, a very kind lady on a street corner came and asked us if we had somewhere to go, if we were OK. I realised that our 5 suitcases of differing antiquity, baby on back with no shoes and socks (seemed a problem for the lady) and general downmarket air belied the fact that we were going around the world for 5 months on a Hong Kong salary. I felt bad, fraudulent in some way!
 
 
haha, clary, it does sound like you need to experience chicago from a slightly different perspective. this time you'll even have time to sit down and look around.

SuperG, i'd invite you to share my room, but something tells me you have other ideas ;-)
 
 
bm
 
 
You mean you went without matching luggage?  

You should have tipped the chauffeur to keep them out of sight in the boot/ trunk.  
 
 
Clary, you only needed 5 suitcases for the 4 of you? those must have been extra large suitcases. ;-)
 
 
 
We could also rent a trolley to take us around. It is actually a bus that looks like a trolley but it fits a ton of people, is reasonably priced and allows drinking on board. They will take us just about anywhere and is safe transportation for all.
 

I like this idea. A2k Trolley making the rounds on the Loop. Would it be catered?

<slowly reading through>
 
 
Heck, I'm 16 pages late, but yahoo! Add me to the list if I haven't booked another trip on those dates.
 
 
 
Clary, you only needed 5 suitcases for the 4 of you? those must have been extra large suitcases. ;-)
 

They were, but we always have travelled light. No extras like babyshoes, for example! And we probably had loads of plastic bags with babyquipment and sandwiches and stuff! What a gypsy family!
 
 
The trolley thing does sound great... easy way to see stuff together, nice and mobile both in space and in place - we wouldn't all be stuck in place around a long table...
 
 
Who will be supplying the drugs?
 
 
what kind do you have in mind, augustus?
 
 
I thought a little black hashish would be quite appropriate for the boat ride.
 
 
Is that the Mystic Cruise?
 
 
The lake will be mighty cold in early May. Bring a warm jacket for a boat ride, but it's definately worth doing - unless you're so stoned you don't notice the temperature, that is, in which case you won't notice your on a boat either so why bother?
 
 
What boat?
 
 
 

man, you're fast gus. I really do need to learn to hit spellcheck before I submit my posts and not depend on sneaking back in afterwards.
 
 
You definitely misspelled a word.
 
 
 
You definitely misspelled a word.
 

Thank you for noticing :wink: and I would, in fact, be on a boat not possess a boat. I always seem to catch this crap after I post.

'nuf-bout-my-bad-english, back to the party planning!
 
 
 Boat rides from Navy Pier (many, it seems) 
 
 
Would anyone recommend that I take the 60-day Greyhound Pass - it's really cheap - so that I can visit all and sundry while I'm over there?
 
 
I don't have any recent experience with Greyhound except that I have considered taking it from the very north of California down to the SF bay area in order to hop on to Amtrak trains... but it turns out that that particular Greyhound service was discontinued.

If it is very cheap, it might be useful for getting to some places Amtrak doesn't go. But... I haven't been on a train in the US for years either.

I'll be interested to see what other folks say.
 
 
Greyhounding might be fun - mebbe a bit uncomfortable here and there, but you'll certainly have the opportunity to meet :wink: interesting   folks. Another thing you might wanna check out is Amtrack  RailPass . The rates for non-US residents are pretty attractive - inquire through your travel agent.
 
 
Long-distance bus trips on a number of routes have become quite nice.

The Greyhound between Tranna and NYC has attendants, movies... - it's nicer than flying in some ways. However, it's more expensive to take the bus than to fly JetBlue <in that example> The biggest upside, IMNSHO, is the ability to see the country you're travelling through.

Cost factors are variable between locations. There are some places trains and planes don't go that buses still do. Lots of angles to consider and evaluate. A lot depends on what the total trip plan is.
 
 
I thought I had already done a bm.
 
 
Do any of the Chicagoans here know the "rock and roll" Days Inn ? I stayed there a few times in the 90's but I can't remember much about location other than it was downtown.

I had some good times there...I guess that's why I can't remember all the details.
 
 
I'm not sure which Days Inn that would be, LTX. There are a few of them downtown.

I was scrolling around looking for places with banquet facilities and discovered that my favorite restaurant in all of Chicago does banquets. Burghoff's is a Chicago MUST on most restaurant guides. It's blocks from the Art Institute, State St, Union Station, Grant/Millenium Parks. I've left my number with the manager to get details, but even if you don't hold your gathering here you should check it out for one meal or another.

 http://www.berghoff.com/ 

The Italian Village restaurant and catering also has a good repution. It's in the same general area as Burghoff's.
 http://www.italianvillage-chicago.com/ 
 
 
wow, lot of food at berghoff. be tough choosing what to get.  
 
 
Last time I was in Chicago we ate at Berghoff's. Nice place.

Haha.

Here's a question for you (please... all foreigners may apply) -- When's the last time you visited the USA and did you get past the east coast?
 
 
9/11/2001, New York. Bad moment to visit. But I did get as far as West Virginia that time - that's not very far west, admittedly...
 
 
 
Do any of the Chicagoans here know the "rock and roll" Days Inn ? I stayed there a few times in the 90's but I can't remember much about location other than it was downtown.

I had some good times there...I guess that's why I can't remember all the details.
 

Were you on the lake? There was a Days Inn on the lake that had a revolving top floor. Unfortunately its gone now.

Gus: sorry for the late reply but yes the Grant Park area can be a bit seedy in some spots, but I wouldn't go as far as calling it dangerous.

Especially if you are walking around with a pitchfork, us chicagoans just don't know how to respond to that.
 
 
It's my first visit to the New World, Piffka, which means, I know it only by looking at maps (and globes - this only for dys :wink: ).
 
 
Clary? 9/11 and in New York? Good heavens, that's horrible timing. Were you in Manhattan? I'd say West Virginia is not too far west.   I hope that wasn't your only visit.

Walter -- I am surprised! Maps, eh? Hmmm.

I think you will enjoy your time in Chicago. I hope you do. Is that the only place you have time to see "this trip"?
 
 
I'm sure, I will!!!

And 'no',, I'm not staying just there.
 
 
 
Here's a question for you (please... all foreigners may apply) -- When's the last time you visited the USA and did you get past the east coast?
 

Less than two months ago. I did get past the east coast...

Francis! Good to know you're a seasoned traveler of the wild & wooly states... are you thinking of going to this party in Chicago?

Ah, Francis.... a busy businessman!

BBB -- that's too bad. At least you can enjoy it vicariously.
 
 
I drove over from Canada three years ago, and they thought I was a very suspicious character indeed.
And the folks in Boston did not think too much of the Canadian numberplates, either....some made rude gestures.
 
 
... furtive eyes, hat carried low over brow & a strange accent might easily be construed as suspicious behavior some places...
 
 
mctag : if you are driving a car with canadian license plates, go to south carolina or florida. there they'll even fly the canadian flag in front of motels and hotels !
we cross into the united states/new york state - by way of the 1000 island bridge - fairly often. while our "accent" - many can't figure out where to place it - may make us a bit of a "security risk", we've found that as soon as we explain to the customs officer that we going shopping in the u.s., we'll be given a friendly wave and a "enjoy your shopping" greeting. as long as you are willing to drop some dollars stateside you'll be welcome, i think. hbg
 
 
Great plans you all have.
May is too early for me- I will be in Chicago again in July.
 
 
I'm with Francis on this. I really admire you people who can make definite plans for travel that far in advance. I'm hoping I'll be able to get to Chicago May 6th, but I certainly can't guarantee it. How do I know what other obligations might have come up six months from now?
 
 
Did I dream Margo said she might go?

I just had prioritized a Jazz club visit with Andrew for that weekend - it worked. :wink:
 
 
That would be so great!

Strewing carrots to attract a bunny to hop across the wide wide sea...
 
 
I just received a PM from J_B alerting me to this thread. I'm pretty sure I can make it (I can get some cheap accomodations without too much trouble). My job takes me out of town sometimes, but that doesn't happen too often.

May is a great time to come to Chicago. The weather is usually mild, not as rainy as April. There are tons of things to do in the city. The Cubs are not in town that weekend but the world champion White Sox are -- a  three game series against Kansas City . Then there is the Art Institute, the museums, Navy Pier, live music, theater, and lots and lots of food. You can get some idea of what's going on at the  Chicago Office of Tourism  site.

Anyone looking for rock-bottom lodging costs should check out the  HI-Chicago Hostel . It's a hostel -- Spartan accomodations, multiple occupancy rooms -- but it's dirt cheap and it's right downtown.
 
 
 
I guess that's something to establish -- would it need to be within walking distance of anything? I'm assuming that train and taxi should cover it for people who don't have cars.

Sorry you won't be there, J_B!

A-ha! I found the rental rates for Garfield Park Conservatory and their Community Room is $25/ hour. 3-hour minimum. That's more like it!
 

I'd left my number at the Garfield Park Conservatory for a call-back. Just heard they are booked for May 6th (wedding season books things up very early).

I haven't heard back from The Burghoff yet, I'll keep you posted...
 
 
Wow, thanks, J_B!

I hate to introduce any more uncertainty into the proceedings, but I noticed that rates are usually much better on Sundays than Saturdays, and there is the wedding thing (weddings are usually on Saturdays).
 
 
Or even Friday evening, if everyone is already in town. When Mr B and I started planning our May wedding in January we quickly discovered that Saturday was out of the question. We ended up with a lovely place on Friday, May 5th which is, ironically, the same weekend we're talking about and one of the reasons I won't be available.

Sunday would probably let you hold it outside at one of the parks, Friday or Sunday indoors is much easier to find than Saturday.
 
 
Seems to have been a good idea to buy my flight from Chicago on Monday (and arriving already on Thursday :wink: ).
 
 
Here's an odd idea -
how about Saturday breakfast-brunch? People may still be arriving on Fri and some leaving on Sunday. Those who want to take children places Sat. afternoon can, or take themselves to the Zoo, etc.

Then those who want to go for beers on Sat night can group together and those who want to hear jazz, go on a boat cruise, etc. can do that..

I'm still liking the trolley thing...
 
 
Yeah, the trolley thing is cool...

I just got my response from the Garfield Park people, too (I forgot I'd sent the question):

 
All my Saturday's in May are booked. I do have Friday May 5th or
Sunday, May 7th or 14th available.
 
 
 
I guess I'm confused about Garfield Park. Was the photo, I think on a J_B post, the part that would be $750.? or the regular old room that was more like $25.00 for a few hours..

Burghoffs seems sort of handy..

Am trying to remember a beer garden Sublime mentioned once. Back in a bit.
 
 
I went off on a Garfield Park tangent after parks were first mentioned (by JP, I think), the above is more of an FYI than any particular endorsement.
 
 
I'm perplexed about how we'd do food for that, re amounts and choices...
I looked up sublime's beerbar link from some time ago, Resi's Bierstube, and Burghoffs. Can't find Burghoff's menu, but as to Resi's, I worry that vegetarians would have near nothing to eat..

Anyone look at the Millenium park restaurant link I gave on page 14? That can be reserved and seems to have built in roominess...
 
 
I just left a call back message for the Park Grille at Millenium park, Osso.
 
 
Ah, good. And I found Berghoff Chicago has more variety than Resi's...

 http://metromix.chicagotribune.com/barsandclubs/29379,0,2925605.venue?coll=mmx-bars_top_heds 

 http://www.fodors.com/miniguides/mgresults.cfm?destination=chicago@49&cur_section=din&property_id=291834 
This last one includes one (not all) neg review, but even that one mentions things a vegetarian could order.
 
 
 
Can't find Burghoff's menu, but as to Resi's, I worry that vegetarians would have near nothing to eat..

 

try this link:  http://www.berghoff.com/Berghoff/dinner_seafood.html 
 
 
Hmm, that Fodor's link doesn't go right to the page, you still have to click on restaurants, Chicago, and then B for Berghoff.

On the first link, it mentions live music... might please some, displease others.
 
 
Great menu link for Berghoff, Yitwail! Makes me hungry right now..

I wonder about the music - it must be only at certain times..
 
 
feeling pretty sick here as I dont think its possible for us

I'll show you the photos, exclusively!
 
 
 

I hope something changes so you can make it, Steve..
 
 
I am amenable to being kidnapped. Drugged with some German beer and waking up in Chicago. It wouldnt be my fault now would it?
 
 
thanks osso

will redouble efforts to er....escape
 
 
I've never heard live music any of the times I've been there Osso. Also, depending on the size of the group, I think you would be in a separate banquet room from the main dining room. If you hold your main event elsewhere and a smaller group ventures into The Berghoff, you would certainly be in the main dining room.
 
 
So it could work out well..
 
 
 
I am amenable to being kidnapped. Drugged with some German beer and waking up in Chicago. It wouldnt be my fault now would it?
 

I hope Walter is paying attention. He might just be able to help with that.
 
 
I'm sure, Mrs. Steve wouldn't like that at all!
 
 
I hope I can get to Chicago on the assumption that there are good chinese restaurants.  
 
 
Just got the invoice for my hotel booking: even 10% less ("early booking discount") than the original (extremely low) price :wink:

I bet there are, satt!
 
 
I also hear that beer of Milwaukee is very good as well.
 
 
 
I'm sure, Mrs. Steve wouldn't like that at all!
 

(there have been moments Walter when she might have thought of fixing such a thing)
 
 
 
I hope I can get to Chicago on the assumption that there are good chinese restaurants.  
 

There are good chinese restaurants throughout the city but a side trip to Chinatown is a great idea. There's a free trolley that runs in the summer and connects to a free bus over to Chinatown.

 http://www.chicago-chinatown.com/ 
 
 
 
(there have been moments Walter when she might have thought of fixing such a thing)
 

Well, in that case...  
 
 
 
I hope I can get to Chicago on the assumption that there are good chinese restaurants.  
 

We have restaurants of every conceivable ethnicity here in Chicago. As J_B points out, there's a Chinatown section on the south side. There's also the Argyle Street neighborhood on the north side -- that's more Vietnamese and Thai, but there are Chinese restaurants there too.
 
 
Yeee Haaaw!

I just got a call back from the banquet coordinator at Millenium Park's Park Grille. She gave us a no-cost, no obligation, temporary hold for lunch or dinner on May 6th. Inside they have private seating for up to 45, semi-private seating for up to 200, outside they have unlimited semi-private space and tenting options. There are no rental fees but there is a person food and beverage minimum depending on day of the week and time of day. Friday the 5th is already on hold but Sunday the 7th is also open.

She's going to get back to me with individual pricing minimums for the 6th beginning at 11:00 am, 5:00 pm and 7:00 pm. I put the hold in the name of A2K so the arrangements can be taken over by someone else.

I hope the $$$ are not prohibitive. This really is a gorgeous spot.
 
 
Wow, you're doing great work, J_B!

I hope the Park Grille is significantly less prohibitive than the rest of the stuff I found at Millenium Park. I don't think that was listed. Here's where I found the other listings:

 http://www.millenniumpark.org/privaterentals/ 

Then click on the PDF, page 13.

It sounds like this is a lot smaller than the other things they list, so that's hopeful.
 
 
Oh, wow, sounds great so far....
 
 
The Park Grille at Millenium Park was used for the filming of "The Lake House" a romantic drama starring Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves. The movie will be released on February 3, 2006.

(My 23 year old daughter worked as an extra in the film.)
 
 
Wow, that's cool, wandel. You must be proud.
 
 
Thank you for the information about Chinatown, J_B and joefromchicago.
 
 
I, like many others, said that I would like to come to Chicago but...it is too early to commit. It's up to yall, but my thinking is this.
There needs to be an event where all of us are in the same place at the same time. I like the Saturday brunch idea that has been suggested. Casual, informal and certainly more affordable than a dinner in some fancy place at a peak hour.
Some folks would get together Friday after arrival; many folks would wander off on Saturday afternoon to explore Chicago and rejoin friends for dinner at the restaurant of their choice. Or perhaps take a hot bath and go to bed, tired but happy.
I would suggest just the one event be on the schedule. Everything else should be left unscripted. But the brunch, if that is the choice, should be in a special place such as some of those mentioned.
I hope to be there. -rjb-
 
 
I would definitely enjoy talking to you in person, realjohn.
 
 
Excellent suggestion, realjohn. Otherwise it could turn out that we're all in the same place at the same time and never actually get together, at least not all of us.
 
 
Would you repeat that, Merry?

Roving bands of a2kers seen at the zoo, jazz clubs, peeking into the lobby of the Palmer House, on some boat in the water, having vietnamese food, thai food, chinese food, german food, staring at The Bean, all talking at once and waving their arms.. Dag of course will be in Millenium park on her rental bicycle..
 
 
Thanks, Merry. Lot of static on your first post.
 
 
It's this new celly. I'm still just gettin' the hang of it, Gus.
 
 
 
Did I dream Margo said she might go?
 

You know me - I'm a travel tart! I'm interested in going anywhere - but then - I've never been to the US of A. Is it safe? (almost certainly not!) Do they all walk on their hands? Are pancakes and bagels compulsory? What is that language they speak? Will Gus be there?

Actually - the timing is probably not good for me - and depends on a squillion things over which I have no control - most involving my having to work! Poop!

Keeping a watching brief! - And checking airfares - although airfares are not the most expensive part of a trip these days - even over this distance. The Oz dollar remains pathetic against the greenback!

And that might be all to the good. What we're talking is a quite respectable jazz combo. And there may be some who have tentative plans but haven't participated in the poll. I know of at least one such A2K member.
 
 
I would like to attend with my better-half but am now in the process of job relocation and my schedule is iffy right now, oh well. But the prospect of being able to meet you guys is extremely attractive. All that intellect and passion in one room plus the prospect of gyros--priceless. Obviously, if I can't attend, it's my loss.

Plenty of time, hope to meet you, James Morrison...
 
 
170 days to go.
 
 
I have been banned from Chicago.
 
 
seriously? for what reason? feel free to PM, if you'd rather not publish the details.
 
 
Who would dare ban our Sturgis?
 
 
I went to Chicago and it snowed for a week, as I prepared to leave there was an ice storm. Did I mention that I arrived as the temperature plummeted to below zero degrees fahrenheit? It stayed under for some two weeks. It was terrible and finally the mayor came to my hotel room and pleaded with me to leave. The next day John Wayne Gacy (the clown killer) was arrested and Dick Butkus was back on the air selling lawn mowers or grills or some item. Well as soon as I left the sun came out and summer returned, unfortunately I brought havoc to Fort Wayne Indiana...yup I have been banned from there too.

(and for the curious this happened during the winter of 78-79)

As for the real fact behind the ban, I cannot go into it. It involved me, a police officer and a rather drunken and naked spree along something called East Wacker Drive. The judge who saw me at the trial advised me not to return...not sure if he really meant forever. (and yes this happened during the winter of 78-79 and the snow and Gacy facts are part of what was going on in Chicago at the time)
 
 
Wacker Drive?
 
 
yeah Wacker drice has a couple Banks on it.
 
 
Wacker runs along the river, Osso.
 
 
Sturgis, do you expect any of us to believe that story? I mean, you are a Republican and a very conservative Republican. And you live in Vermont, for godsake. Sturgis running naked? I doubt it. What's the real story? You can tell us.
 
 
rjb
every youngser does silly things that gets us in trouble once in awhile................. don't they?
 
 
I'm riffing on the name, J_B....
 
 
But...but, but Repubs running naked! Sure, Husker, johnboy got into quite a bit a mischief when he was a lad back in the 60's as a wild-eyed, wild-haired left-wing liberal. The running naked and the long-hair days are gone now for me. But the image of Sturgis...
 
 
is indeed enchanting. Stugis, we have no doubt you are presently as upstanding as the rest of us.

Pause.

Yeh, and me too.
 
 
I've done some pretty silly stuff on Wacker Drive - well, sorta under Wacker Drive. Didn't get banned or anything, but I did get fined, and got some pretty embarrassing attention from The Local Media.

In my defense, I really thought the horse could do it; I was as surprised and dismayed by the ensuing traffic chaos as anyone - with the possible exception of the panic-stricken horse. Fortunately, the critter sustained no lasting injury. Wouldn't have anything to do with tunnels after that - even loading him into a trailer became a production from then on, and he remained real leery of traffic, but no limp or scars or anything like that.

I think my being drunk at the time might be the first clue...
and I wasn't always a Conservative minded fellow...well, not entirely true, my first political party alliance was when I registered to vote as a Conservative...I refuse to register as a Republican.

If you look through some of my posts, you will figure the time line...
I was born, I grew up, I got drunk, I went to college and got drunk, I graduated college and got drunk, I began teaching and getting drunk a few nights a week, I was suspended from teaching for 14 months due to having shown up inebriated on the job 5 times in one month, I fled to my birthplace of New York City, took a job with the Village Voice (they weren't so harsh about the drinking). I left The Voice suddenly and went to Chicago to see if the river really was green...it was after I vomited into it) any way it was the early part of December and the weather went bad. I stayed in a cheap hotel and spent the dollars left to me by my uncle who had keeled over dead a year before leaving me everything...
The winter was bad, I was a mess, I got into a scuffle with a police man, I then kissed him full on the lips and copped a feel...yup, I copped a cop       and I was drunk and according to the arrest info I was com-pletely nekkid at the time. The officer behaved remarkably well and instead of beating me senseless, he hauled me into the station house, I was processed and spent a night locked up then 2, then 3 then I got lucky and went before a judge who said he would let me go but that I really should seek help and maybe it would be best if I never came back to Chicago. I returned to New York in late January, it was a snowy day, I passed out on my Uncle Bert's castro, when I came to, we talked, he took me to an AA meeting...the rest as they say is history...I pulled it together to a degree, I had a few drunken relapses until 1988 at which point it sort of stuck...until 1998...

After Chicago, I came back to Vermont worked as a blacksmith for an old friend until I was allowed to return to teaching...never drank again on the job.

My political stance became steadily more right-leaning (conservative) over time. Back in '68 I actually was against the Nixon Admin. Hell, I used to live in Greenwich Village when it was all about peace and love and sex and drugs...

(the only part that was off int he first part was the part about the Mayor)
 
 
LOL... between the horse and the horny show (kissed a cop on the lips???)... I don't know which is a worse story.

Is THIS why there are all those strange lights on that bridge crossing Wacker?
 
 
Sturgis, I assume that it was after you kissed that Chicago cop on the lips that you had to puke in the river, thus rendering it green?
 
 
 
Wacker Drive?
 

Yeah, Chicago has a street called "Wacker Drive." Actually, it has two streets called "Wacker Drive," and they meet at the corner of Wacker and Wacker. David Letterman, when he came to Chicago, thought that was hilarious, but we live with it every day and don't seem to mind too much.

I think it's much funnier that Goethe Street, named for the famous German writer, is pronounced "Go-thee" Street by the natives.

We also have a statue dedicated to Goethe:

 

Also known as "Naked Guy with Big Bird"
 
 
sturgis, drinking's one thing, but you gotta stay away from love potion number 9. ;-)
 
 
The Naked Guy with Big Bird isn't on Wacker Drive, is it?
 
 
I want to know more about the horse.

We stayed at the Hyatt on Wacker. (We got high on Wacker.)
 
 
 
I want to know more about the horse...
 

Sorry, the more of that forgotten, the better, as far as I'm concerned. Its been nearly 30 years, and I still remember it better than I care to. That's all I'm gonna say  
 
 
Joe, you guys not only pronounce Goethe as 'go-thee', you have some weird notions on how to say place names in your own state. For the uninitiated, Joliet (site of state prison) is Joe-leet and Cairo (spelled same as the capital of Egypt) is Kay-row.
 
 
"As elsewhere in the USA, English is the major labguage spoken.... Midwestern accents tend to be a bit flat with just a touch of nasal twang, but compared to other parts of the USA, most of the English you'll hear is pretty standard - the middle of the country has always produced a share of of plain-spoken TV announcers....."

Thus being written on page 12 of my recently purchased Chicago city guide (Lonely Planet, Melbourne/Oakland/London/Paris, 2004).

I hope, the other infos in the guide are correct  
 
 
That sounds right, Walter. Actually, it's true that American English as spoken in the Midwest is pretty standard and not at all hard to understand. They just have a lot of trouble with words or names that are not of English origin.

Actually it is funny. This statue doesn't look like Goethe at all. It seems the mason has confused two of his orders on delivery. I wonder where the real Goethe ended up.

Done by Hermann Hahn (1868-1944), a sculptor from Munich/Bavaria/Germany, who never had been to Chicago himself.

 Link  - scroll the page about a quarter down.

Symbolism (one/the main concept of neo-classicism) was quite popular in those days, and - not only, because it's mentioned on that site (in German) - Hahne is considered to be one of the most outstanding sculptors of this period.

 
Hahn, Hermann

(Geboren: Kloster-Veilsdorf, nr Rudolstadt, Thuringia, 28 Nov 1868; Gestorben: Munich, 18 Aug 1945). German sculptor. He entered the Kunstgewerbeschule in Munich in 1887 and a year later went to the Akademie where he studied under Wilhelm von Rumann until 1892. In 1896 he took over Rumanns teaching at the Akademie; he became an honorary professor in 1902 and was appointed full professor in 1912, training a whole generation of sculptors who were nicknamed the Munchner Archaiker. Although he became a member of the National Socialist Party, he was compelled to give up his teaching post in 1937. The small bronze statue Eva (e.g. Munich, Ver. Bild. Kstler) established Hahns reputation as a Jugendstil artist. It was only in his middle years that he developed into an outstanding representative of neo-classicism, as is demonstrated in particular by his two monuments to Moltke, one made in 1899 for Chemnitz, in the Hauptmarkt, and the other in 1909 for Bremen, on the facade of the north tower of the Liebfrauenkirche, and the monument to Liszt made in 1900 for Weimar, in the Grossherzoglicher Park. While he still adhered to the portrait figure in these statues, in his monument to Goethe for Lincoln Park, Chicago, unveiled in 1914, he turned the poet into a symbolic figure in the guise of a youthful hero from antiquity.

Sadly no, in fact I think he rather enjoyed it  ...after all he did handcuff me and take me to his (station)house     He even introduced me to his commander...doesn't that just scream luv? Some of us gay guys are a bit kinky...or so I have heard.

Good point -- come to think of it, wouldn't an angelic figure with a harp be perfect for symbolizing me? Not to mention, I adore the Chicago Symphony and love Symphony Hall (I heard Barenboim there when I was there last year -- fabolous acoustics!) I'm so looking forward to going there again.
 
 
I was only thinking of the harp, since you are a mirror picture of an angelic figure.
 
 
Too bad the trees Thomas is centered between have suffered a bit re pruning technique (not entirely horrible but...)
 
 
 
The Naked Guy with Big Bird isn't on Wacker Drive, is it?
 

No, it's at Cannon Drive and Diversey Avenue in Lincoln Park. All the Wackers are downtown.

Thomas was here in Chicago last year and he didn't call me? I'm very disappointed.

It was February last year, when we didn't have nearly as many friendly disagreements under our belts as we do now. Sorry -- won't happen again.

Just as all devout Muslims must make at least one pilgrimage to Mecca, I suppose all devout libertarians must make at least one pilgrimage to the University of Chicago economics department.

 

All hail Friedman and Stigler!

Just marked my calendar for May 6th, Chicago.  
 
 
Being a resident of Chicago, as I may have mentioned once or twice before, I suppose I could try to make this event.
 
 
another reason for my making the effort, smog!
 
 
Oh my, Clary! It's been quite a while, hasn't it? I'm glad to see you again, and I hope that all is well with you. If you're willing to make the effort to travel from whatever far off land you happen to be in now, I guess I can make the effort to travel uptown or downtown or crosstown or... aroundtown(?).
 
 
I should hope so! As a fearful flyer, I enquired about sea journeys to the US - possible, but $6600 +

So if I can conquer my fears and strain the bank balance to get to Chicago, you can certainly bust a gut to get crosstown!!!
 
 
But a round trip for me on the CTA would cost at least 4, perhaps even 6, and--dare I say--maybe as much as 8 dollars! (Probably only 4.) And that's per event !! I could end up spending nearly 16 dollars that weekend on travel costs alone.
 
 
OOOOOooooooooooooooooooh er!
 
 
 
Just as all devout Muslims must make at least one pilgrimage to Mecca, I suppose all devout libertarians must make at least one pilgrimage to the University of Chicago economics department.
 

An excellent point. Unfortunately, neither Friedman nor Stigler is in Chicago anymore. But if you could arrange an appointment with Richard Posner, that would be nice. There ain't no such thing as a free lunch, but I would imagine that lunch with Posner might be interesting enough to merit some expense. We could invite Mortalgato too.

I need some feedback on what price range we need for the central gathering. The Park Grille sent me all of their pricing. Here's lunch/brunch

No specified minimum. If we want indoor seating they will put us in 'adjoining areas' meaning we will get the Founder's room for 40 plus the area of the adjoining public area closest to the Founder's room. If we are less than 40 we will be put in one area of the public room, hence semi-private.

 
EXCEPTIONAL EVENTS BEGIN HERE.

Host your next celebration at The Park Grill at Millennium Park. We have created unique accommodations, perfect for gatherings as intimate as 10 or as large as 1,000. Of course, it's all here for you. A place both familiar and unlike anywhere else.

Millennium Park is the ideal destination location for your next event. Our signature menus and seasonal entertainment make it an experience unlike any other. Sample menus are provided to assist you in planning your event. We are happy to make recommendations or design a customized menu for your group. Our special events department is available to coordinate audio-visual equipment, live entertainment, or anything else that will make your event a success.

SEMI-PRIVATE DINING AVAILABLE FOR LARGER GROUPS
Accommodating 25 to 1,000 guests
Options are available for larger groups

Food and Beverage Minimums do apply for Private & Semi-Private Events

Food and beverage minimums are not inclusive of tax and gratuity.

DEPOSIT
$500.
* Unless Specified Otherwise

GUARANTEE
48 hour advance guarantee for the number of guests in your party.

PAYMENT
Full payment is required at the end of the event
unless prior arrangements have been made.

20% gratuity and 10.25% sales tax will be added to each bill.
Set up fees may also apply.

 
 
 
Oooh, $500 deposit.

48 hour advance guarantee is good. (We'll know a lot more 48 hours in advance than we will 4 months in advance.)

20% gratuity and 10.25% tax means total bill for everyone would be $33.08 each.

Still, sounds promising to me. I'd be willing to pay that. The Founder's room, seating 40, sounds good. Let's see what other people think...

Accommodated in The Founders Room with the adjacent Main Dining Room section (indoor)

Accommodates a Maximum of 90 people seated

Food and Beverage Minimum required: $2,800.00 (not including tax or gratuity)

Accommodated on the Outdoor Patio (directly outside the restaurant)

Accommodates a Maximum of 75 people seated

Food and Beverage Minimum required: $3,000.00 (not including tax or gratuity)

Option 2: Early Evening Dinner from 5pm-7pm

Accommodated inside the Park Grill OR Outside on The Patio

Food and Beverage Minimum required for either space: $3,600.00 (not including tax or gratuity)

Option 3: Dinner from 7:00pm-9:00pm

Accommodates inside the Park Grill OR Outside on The Patio

Food and Beverage Minimum required: $4,500.00 (not including tax or gratuity)

A completed Special Events Contract along with a $500.00 deposit is all that we require to reserve the space for you. This deposit will be applied to the final bill the day of your event. We will charge the card of your choice at the completion of your event.

We do not require parties to pre-select wines, but it allows us to ensure that we have availability (and enough quantity) for your event.

 

I'm not totally clear on what she meant by, "Each person receives a customized menu at no additional charge." I take that to mean we don't need to pre-order, but I'm not sure. I would like some feedback on the acceptability of the price-range before I go any further. Or, if you want to take it from here Soz, that's fine with me, I'll pm you the contact info. If it turns out to be an unacceptable option I can continue to look for other venues.
 
 
Either way is fine with me.

The minimums worry me a bit. Doesn't seem to be an option for just Founder's room + 40 people listed. (Maybe just an oversight.)
 
 
 
 
I think it's much funnier that Goethe Street, named for the famous German writer, is pronounced "Go-thee" Street by the natives.
 

I lived at Wells and Goethe many years ago and NEVER knew how to pronounce that name. Is it "Gear-tay"?
 

The German pronunciation is close to GER-tuh: the "oe" should be pronounced like a short "e" with the lips rounded for an "o" sound.

Frankly, I prefer "GO-thee."

(Ooooh, Wells and Goethe -- sweet neighborhood!)
 
 
I told her to use 75-100 people as a guess. The per person minimum stays the same. If we are only in the Founder's room at lunchtime it will still come in somewhere between 30 -35 per person which is steep for lunch, but it puts everyone in the same place at the same time and takes having to find caterers, etc out of the picture. I'm game to keep looking, I just wanted to through this out there as a baseline. We have a hold on May 6th, which means rights of first refusal. If someone comes up with a deposit for that day we'll have to decide quickly if we want to keep it or not.
 
 
Sounds good to me...

assuming we are more than eight people.
 
 
Sounds really okay.... and I'm sure, we are at least nine :wink:
 
 
The menu reads very attractive, and $35 minimum per person seems fair to me as well. What do the time spans mean though? For example, if we took the 5-7 pm dinner, would they expect us to leave after 7 pm? Or could we spend the rest of the evening hanging out there?
 
 
 
I'm not totally clear on what she meant by, "Each person receives a customized menu at no additional charge." I take that to mean we don't need to pre-order, but I'm not sure.
 

I'm also not sure, but I'll venture a guess. "Each person receives a customized menu at no additional charge" could refer to the ability to choose from that list of foods, with two meal choices available ("One First Course, Two Entrees, One Dessert" or "Choose Two First Courses, Two Entrees, Two Desserts") and the added of additional selections at $5 each. It does end up allowing you a decent amount of choice; still doesn't seem to fit the definition of "customized" I have in my mind. This kind of customization would be free, as it requires little effort on their part.

"We have the opportunity to customize a menu for your event with our Executive Chef based on what you are looking to offer." This is probably actually a custom meal, being able to tell the chef ahead of time exactly what specific foods, different from their menu, you wish to have. That would most likely cost extra.
 
 
I'm not sure if anybody has asked the question, but how is the acoustics at this venue?
 
 
You are going to make music, c.i.? (Or shall we sing as a choir?)  
 
 
Seems to me a Founder's Room, plus the ability to go outside... sounds preferable to some other places we've been discussing, CI, re acoustics..
hard to tell of course.

J_B, thank you so much for the research..
 
 
Walter, With a few drinks under the belt, I may be tempted to chase everybody out of the place with my singing....
 
 
c.i.,

Your singing would be better than listening to walter make a long speech!
 
 
Walter was in the teaching profession before he retired, so it's a toss-up whether his long speech is worth listening to.
 
 
I know, my father is a retired college professor. (Speeches from retired teachers may or may not be interesting.)
 
 
 
$25. Per Person - Choose One First Course, One Entree, One Dessert
Additional Selections Add $5. per person
 

I think this means that the organizer chooses from the list. S/he chooses "One First Course, One Entree, One Dessert" for the party-goers to have. If s/he wants more selections, they cost the additional $5 each per person. The more expensive options would give the party-goers some selection rather than everyone eating the same thing.

The "customized menu" would be a piece of paper at each place telling individuals what they may select/will be served.
 
 
That makes sense, mac. It also makes sense of the "two entree" options and such -- why would someone want two entrees?? It means that the organizer would choose two entrees, etc.
 
 
Ah, yes, that makes much more sense than my theory, mac11.  
 
 
<picks up phone to ask about customized menu>

Soz, are you still coming to Chicago next month? Maybe we could meet there for lunch while you're here and check it out. It's much less expensive than reserving the space for a large group and will give us a chance to sample the food.
 
 
That's an interesting idea! I do plan to go to Chicago, but we still don't have details worked out. As of now we're planning to cram a bunch of things into a short trip, but lunch is feasible (especially if you don't mind sozlet coming along). I'll PM you my email and we'll go from there.

I don't know. Is she well-behaved? :wink:
 
 
Very. :-D
 
 
if sozlet is to speak, I might re-arrange things to attend
 
 
Hee hee...! She'd love nothing more... up on a stage or behind a dais, with LOTS of people paying attention to her... bliss.

Then again, I'd probably have to make an acrobatic leap to clap a hand over her mouth as she natters on about life chez soz...
 
 
Part of the attraction of the meet is getting to meet the Sozzies..
 
 
Unless contraindicated by on-sight evaluation - perhaps by Soz & J_B as mentioned if feasible - it sounds good to me. Right now, we have what - 8 definites and 9 probables, looks like. If the deposit is $500, that works out to a bit under $30.00 apiece spread among the "Most likelies" - I'd be willing to front my share, if others would as well, that way locking the date. At the end of the event, it should be a simple matter to sort out who-owes-what; those contributing to the deposit would be credited their already-paid share of the deposit (the deposit by definition being credited to the overall bill), with any individual remainder coming out-of-pocket at time of settlement as appropriate, all others responsible for the full, unadjusted amount of their individual bills - make sense?
 
 
timber, Sounds good to me! Count me in even in the event I don't make it. If I don't, it'll be my "contribution" to the event.
 
 
timber, i'd like a clarification. if i come, which seems likely, then i'll be accompanied by my spouse. other people might also have companions of one sort or another. so perhaps the poll numbers underrepresent the probable attendance. do you suppose a person who's already voted should vote again if they're bringing someone along?
 
 
I'm a probable, and even though I tend to flake out on things, I think I'd be okay with paying ahead of time.
 
 
This ain't my deal, so this is just my take, yitwal, but I suppose that makes sense too, at least so far as "Definites" and mebbe "Probablies" go. If nothing else, it would spread the deposit fee among more payees. Dunno how important that would be as a consideration, but I can see it bears thinking about.

c.i. brings up a good point - from a hard-hearted, cold, business-first standpoint, one's contribution to the deposit, if we go that way, should neither confer special privileges or perqs nor be subject to refund in any event other than the actual cancellation of the event accompanied by a full refund to A2K of the deposit amount. And even then, I think I'd prolly just let the site keep my share as a general contribution, as c.i. suggests - though I certainly don't think anyone else should have to feel it necessary do the same; your money, your choice.
 
 
yitwail, I think you can only vote once anyway, so it's probably good to say right on-thread whether you plan to be there, and how many. I think the poll is meant to be an aide rather than anything definitive.

For the record, I'm in the "probably" category -- I'd really like to go, (I MUST meet Osso, and would love to meet Walter, and Craven might be there, and and and), but it's tough to make plans that are that long-range. Heck, we have a planned trip to Chicago that's supposed to happen in a matter of weeks that still isn't close to being finalized. E.G. is a globe-trotter for his work and often only makes definite plans a month or so in advance (if that).
 
 
I understand where you're coming from there, Soz; my idea of long range plans is "Lets see what happens"  
 
 
My own take is that someone besides me visas the deposit, assuming we agree, and as it gets closer we pay that person the deposit plus godawful interest accrued, quite how I don't know.

I'm not the financial genius here, but I see the sense of getting a deposit in place.

I also suspect that the numbers will be way higher than anything like nine. I'll gladly swing for my part of nine and interest, if it comes to that.

Just about the time Soz and J_B (who is being a saint, given that she won't be at the meeting, smooches to J_B) I will be suddenly way offline - I'll have to start a thread about that, have never been roaming sans a server, heh, before.

I didn't look all that carefully at the choices yet from J_B's information - will study on it soon.
 
 
Even though I've checked in only as a "probable," just let me know where to send the money, and I will. Like c.i., if I don't make it, it's my contribution to the festivities. Really want to meet Walter.
 
 
smooches received, thanks Osso. I was about to volunteer to float the $500 when you reminded me I wasn't in town that weekend.  

here's the e-mail response on 'customized menu' and my question about 'serving stations' and if the service is from a buffet table or served by waitstaff (I didn't post the stations menu).

 
Once final menu selections are made, we format a menu for your event. We print customized menu to be set at each guests place. We can apply a personalized heading or logo. I have attached an example for you review.

If you select a seated and coursed menu, then it would be served by you waitstaff. The stations document is included with all general information to give you additional information on some of things we offer.

I am supposing I will be interested in the odd dish and the odd drink, but I'll pay x to do that. Will have to review what that implies or if I'll have to toe some line. I like the venue for us, generally, whether or not I eat my exact food.

Hmmm, we could do tradsies?

This all seems much easier that setting up a place and then catering and... besides, it's a great site..
 
 
Looks like mebbe I oughtta figure on paying for 2 - no way can I make a choice between the Salmon and the Sirloin. I'll happily reasign the extra soup and salad, but I get both desert trays.
 
 
Arguments welcome.... now's the time.
 
 
How bad could it be? (filling in my own answers...)

It's all tricky. If we remain under twenty we can meet anywhere. If we get into more, we really need to secure a place. No, not this exact week, but not all so long from now. And over twenty is fairly real, given spouses and children and pals...

When I was looking for hotels, several were booked already.
I'd suggest if you're serious, booking and noting the time when you can un-book without penalty.
 
 
Add me to the list of folks who are willing to front some $$ to make the deposit happen.
 
 
Let us know the name and address (with deadline date) where we're supposed to send the $$.
 
 
$$

I really just wanted to continue the trend of posting $$
 
 
The thing is, if we know there are 32, the amount to be sent is lower than if we are nine. Which is why I think someone with a decent visa could spring for it -
I dunno, where are our accountants?
 
 
I think they're busy running on li'l treadmills...

 
 
 
This being sorta an official A2K thing, my thought is that as much as may practicably done under the A2K banner, so to speak, should be done not by or in the name of any individual, but by and under the name of A2K. I think it best, if we're gonna be dealing with funds on behalf of the organization, the organization oughtta be the repository and the disbursor. Whether a separate account be set up under an existing A2K bank account, a distinct account be opened for the purpose, or book-keeping is employed to track and handle the funds through an existing account is immaterial to me, and likely irrelevant overall, so long as the funds funnel from each contributing individual through A2K to where they're going to pay for directly group-incurred expenses.
 
 
what he said...
 
 
What did he say?
 
 
timber's language also escapes my simple language skills. <smile>
 
 
 
I want to meet everybody [and some especially   ].

I've thaught about that already earlier that perhaps a deposit before the actual event could/should be done.

So, I'm of course in for that. And agree to whatever it was what timber said.
 
 
OK - for those left behind -   - I'll type r-e-a-l - - s-l-o-w-w-w-w.... :wink:

I think the best idea for handling funds for the event is to do it through A2K - contributions toward the deposit and any other event-related expenses go in to A2K, checks to pay for things are written from a A2K account; A2K is the "Event Sponsor", not any of us as individuals - its a business thing. There also should be an oversight committee of some sort, to do the accounting, ride the calendar, and report regularly back to everyone else what is going on.

Not very exciting or glamorous... just business-like.
 
 
I think Craven had mentioned he DIDN'T want anything like that -- but I'm not sure.

To give a little more background, Craven started a thread on the subscriber's forum saying hey let's do this (paraphrase) but hasn't had time to be the organizer, so it's sort of a hodgepodge of people nudging this along with no one central person.

J_B has been doing an absolutely superlative job of more-than-nudging things along, thanks again.

I think we're still safely away from the actual $$ point, at any rate. Not very far, to be sure, but I don't think we need to do or decide anything RIGHT NOW. I'd like to get more feedback on the venue, for starters, before we go to the trouble of locking that in -- even if there is no risk involved, the logistics of getting the money and then returning it if needed are not nothing.

So, let me ask loudly for any lurkers who haven't spoken up yet -- What do you think of the possibility of the Millenium Park Grille ? Is ~$30-35 for lunch too expensive? Is there anything else that gives you pause?
 
 
I personally think Millenium Park Grille is an excellent place. It is centrally located (downtown Michigan Avenue). $30-$35 is about what I expected.

(The earlier suggestion of Garfield Park Conservatory is not as good because Garfield Park is not in Chicago's downtown.)
 
 
wandeljw, Don't you think the important issues should be 1) good venue, 2) transportation access, 3) accoustics, and 4) cost? (Or any other concern for the majority attending.)

Millenium Park Grille is an excellent spot: centrally located and in the middle of a premier tourist attraction itself. I also like the idea of a brunch/lunch get-together. That leaves the rest of the day for everyone to explore the city and maybe arrange for a more informal meet-up later on. The $30-35 price is reasonable. Now we need to concentrate on boosting attendance above 8 or 9.
 
 
c.i.,

I was only responding to soz's specific question about how we feel about Millenium Park Grille.

(see soz's post)
 
 
Sorry, wand, missed soz's post. It seems that the Millenium Park Grille is the best venue as explained by those in the know. I raise my hand in agreement.  
 
 
c.i.,

It would have been better if I had referenced soz's post the way joefromchicago did. Sorry about my lack of clarity.
 
 
me too. it's great that there's a place already earmarked for the Big Meet. bravo, bravo, bravo!
 
 
Millenium parl is great. Easy to get around from there and 30-35 dollars is next to nothing for the honor of meeting people as good as yourselves. I vote yes.
 
 
The Millenium Grill works for me... I really can't think of an alternative with superior recommendations. Wellll... nahhhh... Wrigley Field prolly wouldn't be the best choice: Cubs are at home vs San Diego - parking would be a nightmare.
 
 
 
...
I think the best idea for handling funds for the event is to do it through A2K....
 

Whoa, let's slow down there, big fella. All around, there's a bit too much rush-rush when it comes to money. I mean, we are talking about a gathering that is over six months from now. I hardly think this has to be done yesterday.

As for methodology, that has yet to be decided. This, too, is not a rush. Thank you.
 
 
Doesn't hafta be done hastily, agreed, but its a consideration that needs discussion, IMO... and yeah, The Big Day is a ways off yet, but Big Days have a way of sneaking up on ya... you're of an age such that the phenomenon can't have gone unnoticed by you :wink:
 
 
 
We have a hold on May 6th, which means rights of first refusal. If someone comes up with a deposit for that day we'll have to decide quickly if we want to keep it or not.
 

Given that you're booking in wedding/grad <aka Big Days> season, probably not bad to have a plan for how to handle it if someone else is prepared to put a deposit down for that date.
 
 
I think that - however slowly - we should start thinking/mulling about the mechanics of getting a deposit in at Wherever, since venues can fill up, especially at popular places like Berghoff's and Millennial Grille (the private rooms, I mean) - though I agree we don't have to decide this week.

I guess I can foresee a slump - reasonable, to be sure - of a few months when many people continue not to know if they are possibles or probables or sures.

If the deposit for where we decide to alight turns out to be $500, and we have eight people to fork over slightly over $60. each to hold it, that's pretty high. If we get up to 14 people that are as sure as they can be, it's more like $35. each, which is what we'd be paying for a meal anyway, and the place would be secured.

One of the virtues of the Millennium Grill is that they can vary where we are situated based on numbers as they change from, say, January to April - whereas a more confined sort of restaurant might have room limitations.
 
 
osso, Good point. No need to rush, but hurry up!
 
 
Several comments: I think I see a consensus for a brunch/lunch at the Millenium Grill on Saturday, May 6th. I must admit that I only skimmed through how the menus work. I gather we would each be able to choose from a short list. That is fine. The cost per person would be around $35 which seems to work for everyone here, but I would like to be sure that that number is double-checked. I would imagine that, in a couple of months, we will be promoting this event to the rest of A2K. We don't want to surprise anyone with the fine print (plus tax and gratuity, for example). I think this has been taken into account already.
Predicting the numbers of participants is too complex for me. What % of definites and what % of probables will actually show up? And how many more might we get once we start plugging this? I gather from a recent comment from Osso that an advantage of Millenium Park is some flexibility in accomodating a larger number. Did I read that that correctly?
I don't quite see how they can offer that. If we say 20 one day and 100 the next day, for example. But again, I didn't read all of the details that closely.
As for the $$. I doubt, Timber, that Craven would agree to having this be an officially sponsored and administered A2K event. Not his style, but I reckon we could ask him. Johnboy would be happy to front the deposit money if yall think this event is going to indeed happen. Johnboy has an MBA, was a CPA and has 30 years in business. For an example of his attention to detail, check out the NFL thread on A2K (under Sports or look at Johnboy's recent posts). He volunteers to be the bookkeeper and, unless someone else wants to to it, the receiver/disburser of funds. He would want to report to an oversight committee of a couple of people.
And Johnboy promises to stop writing in the 3rd person.
 
 
 
I would imagine that, in a couple of months, we will be promoting this event to the rest of A2K.
 

As far as I am aware, every A2K member could take notice of this thread/date if she/he wanted?!
 
 
Heh!

I think the oversight committee stuff gets way too complicated and possibly hairy for A2K. I'm not sure what I think the best idea IS, though.

I agree with everyone that sooner is better as a general concept, but I am wary of rushing in where money is involved. As J_B has pointed out, we DO currently have it reserved until someone else asks for it, and then if that happens (someone else wants it) presumably we have some time to figure out whether we want to jump on things or not.

I'd like to get more feedback about what people think of this venue, for one thing. (Thanks to everyone who has spoken up so far.)

Then we can figure out how to work the money situation. It is one of those things that seems simple but has a lot of elements to it. As others have said, I really don't think A2K wants to get involved in that part in any official way. Too many complications and possibilities for things to go wrong. Who's liable? Etc.

J_B, I wonder if you can contact the Millennium Park Grille person for ideas from her? I can do that, too. Perhaps they have some mechanism in place. Something like checks going directly to them until the total is $500, and them keeping track of it.
 
 
Point noted, Walter. But how many threads have you never visited? For many folks, this could be one of them. I have many A2K friends, some from the mid-west, who only visit to look at a few of the topics or threads they follow. They never venture out into other places beyond. Nice people; fascinating people to chat with; the kind of people I would enjoy meeting at an event in Chicago. All I was trying to say was that, once we this thing gets organized, we would, I think, want to promote it a bit.
 
 
The reason they can do that, RealJohn, is that they have a lot of space options because of the restaurant's rather unique site. Can't remember what page it is on, but when J_B first heard back from them her post on that explained it all. (Heh, it's after page 14 and before page 39...)
 
 
I mean, if it is really a question of getting these $500 NOW (or within a shortest time), I would send that sum by Paypal if there's no other way... (I've my hotel vouchers and flight tickets since week :wink: )
 
 
"Oversight" simply means, Soz, that every once in a while, a one page report gets mailed or faxed or emailed to someone else. Nothing more complicated than that. I didn't mean to suggest otherwise. I would just be more comfortable knowing, since money is involved, that someone else was also in the loop.
 
 
That's kinda the point, though. Why is someone else in the loop?

Money automatically makes things more complicated.

I'd be interested to see if Millenium Park Grille has any suggestions, any way to keep A2K or any single or group of A2K'ers from being responsible.

Meanwhile, I don't think I got in yet that that weekend is Cinco de Mayo -- tons of cool celebrations in Chicago.
 
 
In going right to "Who pays for what how", I prolly jumped the gun... before that becomes an actual factor, we've gotta determine just what it is we're gonna do, and how we're gonna go about promoting it and executing the plan. There's plenty to be nailed down before we get to checkbook time; not much point naming a designated driver and establishing a tour itinerary if neither the car nor the destination have been settled on :wink:
 
 
I see some back-peddling going on. Not a good sign for positive thinking.
 
 
I dunno as I'd characterize it so much as backpedaling, more like analysis in greater depth. One thing we shouldn't overlook is CdK's take on things - ultimately, this is his football, and how we play with it is pretty much up to him.
 
 
e-mail sent with questions I've seen so far:

 
Thank you for getting back to me so promptly on our questions. The 'hold' we have on May 6th gives us the right of first refusal prior to having a deposit of $500 to lock the date and time. What turnaround time do you require on a decision if someone else requests the date? At the moment it looks like the group is leaning toward the lunch/brunch time slot but if someone else were to offer a deposit for that date, how fast would you need an answer back from us? Is the two-hour time slot we discussed the minimum amount of time the group would be able to use the space at the prices quoted?

Also, since this is an international group meeting in Chicago, we currently do not have a designated sponsor that is covering the costs. In your e-mail below you mention 'We will charge the card of your choice at the completion of your event.' I read this to be a single card. Do you have events where the cost is split by the participants or do you require a credit card from a single source for the deposit and then one for the balance?

 

Stay tuned...
 
 
You rock, J_B. :-D
 
 
Thanks Soz.

ci - I did not ignore your question about acoustics but I thought I could check it out myself by going there for lunch next month (with Soz perhaps) rather than ask the person whose job it is to sell the space. I'm thinking it's going to be fine, but I agree it should be checked out.

realjohn, hidden costs would include beverages as we did not include a beverage package in the estimate.
 
 
J-B, You're the best. Some of us old fogies have a hard time hearing in a room full of chatter, and all considerations will be appreciated.
 
 
 
All I was trying to say was that, once we this thing gets organized, we would, I think, want to promote it a bit.
 

I like Walter 's solution: add a reference to the get-together in your signature line.
 
 
I'm doing that right now. Good promo idea.
 
 
I have another suggestion. Add this link to the tag line.
 
 
Mebbe something like:

would fit in a signature box for sure - though overall character count restriction would impact any other text you might wanna have in your signature.
 
 
For the record, I'm down with the (Millenium) Park Grill.
 
 
I think code isn't allowed in signature lines anymore, though. As in, old stuff that hasn't been changed still works, but if you add the code now, it'll appear with the "urls" and such and not be clickable.

Can still have something about it, with "check the Announcements forum for details" or something.
 
 
The signatures were changed to disallow url tags. The code tags aren't necessarily the problem. But yes, in effect, you're right.

mac's signature info is very good:

 
Are you coming to the party?
OFFICIAL A2K GATHERING IN CHICAGO, MAY 6th, 2006!
Check the Announcements Forum for details.
 
 
 
Thanks, wandel. I stole it from timber and sozobe.   Feel free to copy it.
 
 
Done - changed mine :wink:
 
 
ditto, but with modifications
 
 
That looks good!

(I'm pretty sure it's all code, smog, like [img] and [color] as well.)
 
 
Yeah, I think you're right. I think you might also be right about the terminology. I was talking about the [code] tags specifically, but it does occur to me now that they could be called that because they let you see all the "code" of all the other tags.
 
 
Ah, I see now what you meant.

Hey Chicago people, any recommendations on what to do beyond the main event?

When I go in a few weeks (IF I go), I'll be hitting:

 The Field Museum  (with Sue   the ginormous T-Rex).

 The Shedd Aquarium 

and

 The Brookfield Zoo 

among other places.
 
 
 The Museum of Science and Industry  is all right and pretty easy to get to, driving, that is.
 
 
We've taken the L to the Museum of Science and Induistry several times, but that was in the early 70s. BTW, it's a great museum.
 
 
For art lovers, don't miss the Art Institute.
 
 
I think a lot of A2Kers would enjoy the  Chicago Arts District  in Pilsen.

Hey, timber, you're forgiven. Your computer skills are appreciated by many - including me!
 
 
Art Institute, Green Mill, Museum Campus, piers, Pilsen undergroung galleries...
 
 
I'm a big fan of the  Chicago Historical Society , but I don't know how it works as a destination. I've only used it for research.
 
 
Right C.I. I would have to spend more than one day in the Art Institute. It's stupendous. And their garden restaurant's nice as well.
 
 
2nd floor there is all about Al Capone :wink: (History Society, that is)
 
 
And there's always the Hancock Building, the Water Tower, Michigan Ave's shopping, and other big buildings. And yeah, as Walter said, Navy Pier can be nice. In fact, May might be one of the best times to visit it.

I don't really go downtown all that often, so I'm gradually remembering the places I've visited...
 
 
Smog, that's different than the Gallery district in this map, isn't it?
Do you like both, or only the Pilsen area, Smog? (I might try to see both..., plus the Art Institute)

 

I'm figuring to do some walking past, and for a minute or two into, some old haunts, like Marshall Field's (I refuse to call it Macy's, and won't be shopping, just want to look up - at least it used to have an open center to it) and the Palmer House, catch that Trolley (I think it was Sublime who talked about it), wondering if one can go to the top of Sear's Tower (or other such skyscraper wonders); wouldn't mind eating Chinese food (or other such as Vietnamese or Thai) with Satt if he wants company, think I'd love the acquarium..
listening for more Chicagoans' favorite places..
 
 
 
Smog, that's different than the Gallery district in this map, isn't it?
Do you like both, or only the Pilsen area, Smog?
 

Yeah, my memory is pretty fuzzy. Let's go with both. Heh.
 
 
It's Carson, Pirie, Scott for me! Their quality for clothes is the best.
 
 
As funny as this may sound, I wish to see the Water Tower again.
 
 
Ah, you liked the Garden Restaurant at the Institute, JL? Hmm. I can see a whole day there too. I suppose it's closed on Monday (my plane leaves at 6pm).
 
 
 
 
Smog, that's different than the Gallery district in this map, isn't it?

Yeah, my memory is pretty fuzzy. Let's go with both. Heh.
 

Also, my reading comprehension is pretty fuzzy.... Ha.

So yes, the Arts District is different from the Gallery District. I think you would prefer the Arts District.
 
 
smog, Please don't apologize for your reading comprehension. That "really" puts me in a bad way.  
 
 
Totally amazing, the art institute is open on Monday. I'm thinking of going on Friday, but I like to go back to places so rich in treasures..

I'll apologize for whatever I want, dammit!
 
 
Sorry for using such strong language. (See, whatever I want!)
 
 
I'm guessing the Pilsen gallery area is just to the left of the E in Dan Ryan Expressway (it's around S. Halsted and 18th) -

 
 
 
You're too tough for my blood.  
 
 
Yep, that's correct, osso.
 
 
The map from their site:
 
Doesn't really give you a sense of the surrounding area, but does give you a sense of the size of the Arts District itself.
 
 
Silly me, I didn't see it on their site..
but I guess the other map gives a sense of where it is relative to Soldier Field..
 
 
Yeah, Peoria and Canalport aren't exactly huge landmarks. Heh.
 
 
Last time I was at Soldier Field I was a child with my mother at the Marian Year Tribute (largest crowd there ever).

 http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1165.html 

Some things change, but Soldier Field is still there...
 
 
Some sites for tourists:

 Chicago Traveler 

 Lonely Planet Guide 

 Chicago Convention and Tourism Bureau 

 Virtual Tourist 

I particularly like Virtual Tourist: not the same old tourist brochure platitudes.
 
 
I just read that quickly as 'virtuous tourist'!!
 
 
 Looks good - the Virtual Tourist Things to Do in Chicago page 
 
 
Perhaps of interest to some - the City of Chicago has a great  Landmarks  website - pics, info, maps, etc.
 
 
Good site, Timber.
already I have to add Louis Sullivan's Carson Pirie Scott to my walk.

Hmm, I want to look up info about various skyscrapers, Helmut Jahn's et al. I can skip the Sear's Tower for a place less likely to have a long line to go to the roof area if there is both access and a view. Who knows, I don't, maybe Jahn did the Sear's Tower. Lots to learn..
 
 
I usually like the Access guide books a great deal - for the way they are laid out and the information that they give for what is right in front of you as you walk down a street, often fascinating. Here's the Chicago guide:

 A2K link to Access Chicago 
 
 
Well, ready or not, I'm booked from May 5 thru May 9. Staying at the Millenneum Knickerbocker Hotel.
 
 
timber, I just read the first page of this thread, and your mention of the Chicago hotdog made my mouth water. Man, this is gonna be great!
 
 
50 varieties of Martinis????

Kidding; that looks to be sited very nicely, right near the Water Tower..
 
 
There are a number of boat tours along the river and lake front. The architecture tour is fabulous.
 
 
Woot! It sounds like some folks will still be around on Monday. I'll be back in town Sunday night and will keep Monday open to come downtown if folks are still up to gathering.
 
 
Leaving Monday morning/noon  
 
 
I looked up one of the Virtual Tourist links for the Sears Bldg and it said that the writer preferred the view from the Hancock Bldg; I looked up the Hancock Bldg and found this photo -
Wow!!!!

 Evening view from the Hancock Bldg 
 
 
I figure I can do Monday morning or reasonably early lunch, have to get to O'Hare by 4 pm or so.
Girl may be walking around with her luggage though - I'll have to see when check out time is, though I suppose I can leave it with the hotel desk..
 
 
depending on circumstances and osso, I may look at attending to the windy city.

I'll second that. The historical society has walking and boat architecture tours that are fabulous.
 
 
Oh, wow, dys, that would be terrific!
 
 
Yeah, just terrif...
 
 
Looks like the Chicago Historical Society tours start in June, but here's a website that lists a lot of different tours.
 http://www.frommers.com/destinations/chicago/0006010019.html 

The link JoefromChicago gave, Virtual Tours, was very complete for tours, I think.. (or was that Timber's link, geez, lot to learn).

I gave a boat tours from Navy pier list awhile ago, but who knows on what page - easier to just look it up again.

I suppose we should be compiling a links list/recommended places list before this thread gets to be a zillion pages.
 
 
Here's the average weather for Chicago in May.
May 70.0° F 51.0° F 3.70 in

It'll probably be in the low 60s early in the month. A bit on the cool side for most of us.
 
 
A bit on the high side for those in Eureka.
 
 
We are definitely spoiled in the San Francisco Bay Area. LOL We are usually 10-degrees higher than SF.
 
 
<We're in a colder "pocket" right here. 35 miles inland it can be 105 in the summer, and we still hang at 63...>
 
 
I got some answers to my questions but some of them were only half answers and I need to follow up.

 
We will continue to hold the space for your group until we receive another inquiry. If that should happen, we will give you first right of refusal on the space. At that point, we allow 48 hours for you to provide a financial commitment towards the space. If we do not receive this within 48 hours or hear from you at all, we will release the hold.

We normally allow 2 hours for all events. This is what the minimum is based on. We can be somewhat flexible with the timing of the event to accommodate your requests.

You can charge more than one card at the completion of the event.

 

We can charge more than one card at the completion of the event, but that doesn't indicate it can be 50 cards or any answer towards multiple inputs to make up the deposit. I'll ask again....

We now know we have 48 hours to decide on keeping the space if another request comes in and that our quote is based on 2 hours. There are plenty of other places nearby where the group can move to including some of the hotel lobbies or Millenium/Grant parks if the weather is nice. The Art Institute is literally next door so some might choose to visit there after lunch.
 
 
When I was in Chicago a few weeks back, I was walking from the Shedd Aquarium to the Navy Pier. At first glance it appears that the walk would be an uninterrupted one, about a mile or two, but as you near the Pier it becomes painfully apparent that there is a river blocking the way. My companions and I stood and stared at the obstruction, then looked around, trying to ascertain how to circumvent this unexpected blockage. We noticed a pedestrian bridge about fifty yards back that spanned the river, and headed toward that. As we were walking that way I noticed a small wiry, very energetic woman of about fifty years of age. She had been behind us pretty much since the Shedd and now she continued to follow us.

As I glanced at her she asked, "Are you going to the Navy Pier?"

"Trying to", I replied, and she laughed and said, "I thought so. I've been following you guys and hoped you were going there."

I didn't quite know what to think of that, smiled at here, and continued on my way. Upon arrival at the Pier, every time I stopped to look at something... she would stop and linger close by. This went on for quite some time and the thought occurred to me that this might be an A2K member. I don't know why I thought that, really, it's just that some Chicago people knew I was going to be in town and also knew that I would be in that specific area.

The woman continued to follow me until I became unnerved and jumped on a trolley to escape the Pier. I glanced out the back window and could see her standing there, staring at the departing trolley.

I have this gnawing suspicion that that may have been Joe, the Chicago lawyer, dressed in drag.

But why was he following me? What in the hell did he want?

These questions have been weighing heavily on my mind.
 
 
gus, I enjoyed your narrative until the Joe in drags, then I really had a good laugh.

I wanted to get on that damned trolley but you kept screaming at the driver "go go GO!" and it left without me. And there was no way I was going to run after it in those high heels.
 
 
Hmmm.
 
 
i'm glad things are humming along.
 
 
That's just 'cause we're not sure of the words, exactly. We're all doing the same tune.
 
 
hmmmmmmmm
 
 
I wasn't hmmmm'g o'er naught, but naught is there, evermore.
 
 
How many A2K-folk have signed up to descend upon Chicago?
 
 
I don't think there's a sign-up, per se -- the poll can give you a rough outline, but it's pretty rough.

I'd say 20 is a safe estimate at this point, but who knows. The total who have voted continues to creep upwards, too, so I bet the number will increase between now and then.

I think at this point we're waiting for J_B to get back to us with more Millennium Park Grille info -- not certain, though. (J_B, if you'd like me to take over the inquiry phase, just say the word. You're doing wonderfully, just don't want to pile too much work on one person.)

Zane, any recommendations for what to do while there?
 
 
Did you see the latest email from Millenium Park, soz? It's on the previous page...

Right, I was going by this part:

 
We can charge more than one card at the completion of the event, but that doesn't indicate it can be 50 cards or any answer towards multiple inputs to make up the deposit. I'll ask again....
 

I think we're trying to figure out whether it's feasible for Millennium Park Grille to handle the financial aspect directly, rather than needing a middleman (as the middleman stuff opens up several cans of worms...)
 
 
The 48 hour turnaround on the deposit makes it difficult to have the inputs come from individual participants. If the group is ready to commit (it sounds as though that might be the case) then we don't need to wait until we're up against a 48 hour time crunch and we can think about deposits trickling in. Fifteen people prepaying $35.00 will establish a $525.00 deposit. That will be difficult to acheive in 48 hours if you wait until the last minute.

Here's my thought... Someone who zero balances their credit card every month so there's no interest charges accrued (me, for instance) agrees to front the deposit and then at the meeting people pay off the balance except 14 people who each give someone $35.00 (or whatever the amount works out to) to hold on to that can meet up with me on Monday or can send me a check when they get home (I'll donate the remaining $10.00 to the cause). If someone else fronts the deposit then 13 people can pay that person back and the rest can pay towards the balance. This assumes they'll take multiple inputs into the balance.

I just sent the followup e-mail, I should hear back in the next day or two.

Makes sense to me. I could also PayPal you my $35 in advance if you want me to. (PayPal works best in international transactions, but I'm not religiously devoted to it.) That way you'd have fewer people to run after during the meet-up itself.
 
 
 
I could also PayPal you my $35 in advance if you want me to.
 

I think, this is the easiest way, namely using PayPal.
 
 
I'd like to find out what the options are with Millennium Park Grille before we go that route. For example, 48 hours might not come into play... if a) they accept small amounts to add up to a $500 deposit, b) they give refunds, and c) we decide we want to go with Millennium Park Grille for the venue, we can just get started with the deposit amounts going straight to them.

Then, if another request is made before we've finished making the deposits, we would have 48 hours to make up the difference rather than starting from $0. IF another request is made -- it seems feasible that all $500 worth would get there in a reasonably timely fashion.
 
 
PayPal does charge a fee, but it's okay with me.
 
 
The $500 deposit is non-refundable and needs to come from a single source. They will apply the balance to 1 or 2 cards at the completion of the event but they have no mechanism in place to act as host/sponsor of an event and collect money from the participants.

The cancellation policy is 50% of the event minimum if cancelled prior to 60 days of the event or the full event minimum if cancelled within 60 days. In other words, don't cancel.

The event minimums are the food and beverage minimum for the given space/day/time. The quotes we have for midday excluding tax/tip are:

Founders Room (max 40): $1250 ($31.25 pp +tax/tip if 40 people)
Founders Room plus adjacent dining room (max 90) $2800 ($31.11 pp +t/t if 90)
Outdoor seating (max 75) $3000 ($40.00 pp +t/t if 75)

The two entree choice menu plus beverages will easily cover the food and beverage minimum as long as we have close to the maximum number of people for the area.

We really need to have a better handle on how many people are coming before we commit to a particular space. If we are only at 25 people then we don't want the Founders Room and would need to get a quote for space in the dining room.

Hopefully it will be quite a while before they give us a 48hour notice for a deposit. In the meantime I can keep looking for something that will let us make a reservation for "pick a number" in mid April without a deposit. It's probably easier to pull off for lunch than dinner.
 
 
J_B, Thank you for all your effort on our behalf. I think a good point to start is to get committments by name and number soon. Otherwise, that 48 hour reservation is gonna be missed.

Count me for "1." c.i.
 
 
Thanks for your work!

But:

"2".

Since we can't change our responses to the poll as we get more certain of what we'll do, I hereby volunteer to post the confirmation status of each contributor to this thread on a weekly basis. That should help us keep track of things.

Got it, sorry  
 
 
Well, if we are less than 25 and just go to the dining room, we order as regular diners, don't we? Realjohnboy nicely offered to act as banker several pages ago, and no one responded to him. Perhaps a table banker, where as many as possible pay cash.
 
 
If you are less than 25 then you aren't an 'event' and don't need a deposit. Taking a count of how many are coming is a good idea regardless.
 
 
Well, I'm coming.
 
 
Do I understand correctly that the Founder's Room, if we reserve it, is $1250 no matter what? As in, $35+ tip if we have 40 people, $125 + tip if we have 10?
 
 
The count is very important now; we need committments.
 
 
I don't think we can reasonably expect commitments at this point, not commitments to plan on. I think it's more reasonable to choose a venue that has a lot of flexibility built-in, as we talked about from the beginning -- and not sure if Millennium Park Grille is it.

Sublime, did you say at some point that you had a room available in your condo/ apartment? It's sounding good to me to have a baseline backup plan (as in, maybe not ideal but workable and definite and especially CHEAP) while we try to come up with something that fits the many criteria we're going for.
 
 
 
Do I understand correctly that the Founder's Room, if we reserve it, is $1250 no matter what? As in, $35+ tip if we have 40 people, $125 + tip if we have 10?
 

Exactly!

 
The count is very important now; we need committments.
 

Not necessarily, ci. We probably have some time before they get another request for the space and in the meantime I can try to find alternatives that are more flexible. If people can commit now great, and if we know we're close to 40 then we can take the Founders Room when pushed. Otherwise knowing approximately how many people we have can give us a good estimate for the dining room.

I'm sure it's too soon for many people to commit. This might not turn out to be the best choice of locations because of the upfront commitment they require. I'll keep looking. There are hundreds of restaurants in Chicago. We'll keep the MP Grill in our back pocket but maybe Soz and I can both look for some alternative ideas.
 
 
Sounds just right, J_B, good thinking.
 
 
I agree. (And will be looking -- I'm a bit giddy because I've been researching my own upcoming trip and found that if we schedule it right [and IF WE GO] we can go to the big three that I wanted to go to -- Brookfield Zoo, Shedd, and Field Museum -- all free!!)

With the free hotel room and free gas (we're driving, and E.G. gets reimbursed for going to a conference), we might spend less ON vacation than if we stayed home!

That'd be cool.

Anyway, point is, I'm deep in Chicago arcana and will keep eyes open.
 
 
Oh good..
 
 
 
Realjohnboy nicely offered to act as banker several pages ago, and no one responded to him. Perhaps a table banker, where as many as possible pay cash.
 

I volunteer to be on the oversight committee!

Since I'm already there on Thursday, may I ask for being one guest at the tryout?
