In February Im flying out to Iran with work for a couple of weeks but then Ive got some time off, so I thought Id make a trip out of it.

Planning to see some places in Iran, then visit Kurdistan, southern Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine and finally Israel. Ive got 5 weeks to do all this so its a rather rushed itinerary. Planning to get some overnight trains to get around faster.

Just wondering if anyone has been to any of these places and could recommend anywhere or anything?

Well, I live in Israel, so if you've got any questions, lemme know.

I've been to Lebanon as well, but I was in a tank and I had a whole bunch of buddies with me, and sight-seeing wasn't on our list, sorry...

Thanks Biggross,

Have a few questions about Israel - I have been to Tel Aviv and Jerusalem before, but hoping to see a little more of the country this time.

few questions

- I have 2 days to spend in either Eliat or Aquaba. Was wondering which you'd recommend? Also wondering if its warm enough at this time of year to enjoy the beach? I dont know if your into Diving, but if so id like to hear any reccomendations on dive sites and companies to go with.

- Is the dead sea worth a visit?

- Was thinking about stopping in Sderot on the way from Eliat to Tel Aviv for a few hours. Was wondering if you can see the Gaza strip from anywhere there (obviously not going into it). I know its a little voyeristic, but Id quite like to clap eyes on the place you know..

- Anywhere you'd particularly reccomend? Wheres your favourite places?Israels pretty big on the tourist trail these days, so im guessing its quite hard to avoid the traps. Local knowledge is invaluable.

Cheers, really appreciate the help
 
 
Go to Tulkarm in the West Bank. Simple, but has charm.

If you have a choice go to Aqaba. Jordan is beautiful, and so underrated. I don't wana make Ross upset, but Israel is so popular, it would be nice for someone to pay attention to the places that arent so well known but still just as beautiful. Aqaba is a must. Besides, do it for me. I can't leave for another 6 months because I'm going to have an operation. I really wanted to see Aqaba.
 
 
Wow, sounds like an exciting trip. I wish I had the time and the money to do that.

Thanks for the advice Intifada... are you from Palestine originally?

I only have 1 day in the west bank... Ive found an english speaking taxi driver whos reccomended on the Lonely Planet forums. Hes charging $20 US an hour, and has reccomended Bethlehem, Jericho, Qumran, Hemron and then hell drop me off in Masada where ill get the bus to Aquaba (via Eilat). Just looked at Tulkarm, but it seems quite far to the north. How long does it take to get there from Jerusalem? Is it worth the diversion?

Good luck with the operation... hope its nothing serious... mind if I pm you with annoying messages about the area? Ive only got 1 day in the west bank so want to see as much as I can.

Iran is cheap, cheap, cheap! Sanctions have made sure of that.

But as a citizen of 'the great satan' I think you need a government escort.

Thats the advantage of being from from an insignificant potatoe republic, weve no beef with anyone (apart from our sworn enemies, the 'the little satan' next door)

Well, I didn't go there from Jerusalem I went through Amman, because I have family there too so it took me a couple of hours. Honestly if you're looking for a lot of retail shops and tourist hype, no TK is not worth the diversion, but, if you're looking for a quaint little town with a lot of culture, and desperately trying to escape tourists, then it is definitely worth the diversion. While in Palestine I recommend you try the food there. They have terrific shawarma.

You can send me as much as you like, it's ok. I'll tell you as much as I know, and whatever else you need to know. If I do it late please forgive. I don't have net at home anymore so I go to our local net cafe or the uni. I go everyday so I'll be quick.

Yea actually the operation is quite serious. All I'll say is I have cancer. It's not something I've swallowed easily these past few months, so I'll not go into too much detail yet. It's kinda fresh.

Yea I'm from Palestine. Well my family is. I'm first generation. My family is from Tulkarm. Notice the bias?   Eh, its great place really.

What about me? I have American citizenship but am Palestinian.

Potato republic? Is that Ireland?

It would be Ireland indeed. The 'little satan', of course, is Perfidious Albion.

Good luck with the operation.
 
 
"The 'little satan', of course, is Perfidious Albion."

Actually the lesser satan according to the Tehran mullahs in 1979 was the godless commies, IIRC.

They told us that they dont have to give a reason, which they didnt...

But we suspect it may be because the 31st anniversary of the 'revolution' is coming up on the 12th of February. No doubt the Green movement will be doing some protesting... I think they may be a little paranoid about foreign journalists sneeking in.

My Boss is furious.. we were due to go on the 15th of feb. Her counterpart in Iran says that he will lodge a complaint with the government... as if thats gonna help...

Funny thing is there is one girl here from the Philliphines - HER visa was not cancelled. Everyone else is mostly Irish or British and 1 latvian.

Am absolutely gutted... I might be able to fly to Turkey and do some of the trip, but I have to pay for that myself..
 
 
whenever you want mate youll welcome.
 
 
You'll get to go, don't worry. Keep a positive outlook. Maybe they'll change their minds.

Yea they're like that to Arabs too. That's how you know Ahmadinejad's rants about Palestine are just lip service. He's just wanting to take focus off his disastrous economic policies.

Thanks Intifada, but theres no way. It took them six months to approve the visas, and they just change their mind at the last minute.

In any event, the Irish Mental Health Coalition had payed for everything (It was supposed to be charitable), I doubt even if the Iranian authorities did change their minds that they would let us go now.

As the flights connected in Istanbul, our work has said that (if we pay for the taxes on our flights) we can still go and take the holiday as unpaid leave.

I booked a flight home from Tel Aviv anyway, so I think I'll still go, but wont be able to go to Iran or Kurdistan now.

Hope you enjoy the time. WB should be a very eye-opening experience.

Thanks Pari, youve been to Turkey I take it?

Ive heard from more than a few people that its a bit of a Juggernaut for natural beauty and history.. Europeans take over the coast on scallie bing drinking package holidays, but seldom venture into the interior.

There was a guy on a travel forum who suggested going to Georgia to see the 'cave cities'... looks pretty cool

Nah but it's on my 'must do' list. Her indoors has been there and loved it, we're going to do it when the kids are a bit older...

..

 

That may be the last time you hear from her:( I don't hold much hope of some power crazed official changing their mind at such a sensitive time.
Hope springs eternal

 TCDD - TURKISH STATE RAILWAYS 

normally i would take bus tours like this:
 Turkey Tours | Cappadocia Tours | Packages Tours Turkey | Turkey Vacations | Ephesus Tours 

or this:

 cappadocia tours from istanbul | cappadocia to pamukkale | Tours of Cappadocia 

Persians called this place, where The immortal elven Princess Sime choose to transform in to a piegon for his love,"Katpatuka",, the land of horse breed or "Land of Beautiful Horses" (or good breed horses?) in 5th century B.C.   )

today as far as i know Capadoccian breed horses are not accepted for international racing because of their extremities (speed or something like that).

i ll try to find some English documentation for this
 
 
 THE PERSIAN EMPIRE & KINGDOM OF CAPPADOCIA 

 
The Cimmerians ended the Phrygian reign, and were then followed by the Medes (585BC) and the Persians (547 BC). The Persians divided the empire into semi autonomous provinces and ruled the area using governors who were known as ‘satraps’. In the ancient Persian language, Katpatuka, the word for Cappadocia, meant "Land of the well bred horses".

The Persians gave their people the freedom to choose their own religion and to speak their native languages. Since the religion they were devoted to was the Zoroastrian religion, fire was considered to be divine, and so, the volcanoes of Erciyes and Hasandagi were sacred for them.

The Persians constructed a "Royal Road" connecting their capital city in Cappadocia to the Aegean region. The Macedonian King Alexander defeated Persian armies twice, in 334 and 332 BC, and conquered this great empire.

After bringing the Persian Empire to an end, King Alexander met with great resistance in Cappadocia. He tried to rule the area through one of his commanders named Sabictus, but the ruling classes and people resisted and declared Ariarthes, a Persian aristocrat, as king. Ariarthes I (332 - 322 BC) was a successful ruler, and extended the borders of the Cappadocian Kingdom as far as the Black Sea.

The kingdom of Cappadocia lived in peace until the death of Alexander. From then until 17AD, when it became a Roman province, it fought wars with the Macedonians, the Galatians and the Pontus nation.
 

i knew Conan was taken from Mameluke commander and ruler Baybars (Howard admitted it) but Cimmerians were living in Anatolia too?? that was never attracted my attention   )

Sounds like a bitchin trip Zara, sorry to hear the Iranians are mucking about with the visa stuff. I tried to deal with these clown shoes in Istanbul a while back and got no joy. I got Kurdistan on my radar for Sept, seems easy enough from the research I have done, lots of Kurdistan is in Turkey, easy peasy. Some is in Iraq, visa at the border. Syria rocks, nice friendly people and good food. The Crac de Chevleres is not to be missed. At all. After a few weeks on the road Berut wil be a welcom breath of fresh air as they got al things a westerner could hope for, birds that are well fit abound! They even have good Mexican food near the AUB. Jordan is way col too and Petra rocks. Isreal is O.K. and worhth a visit as there is lots to see but the izzies are loud rude wankers and the place is grossly overpriced.
