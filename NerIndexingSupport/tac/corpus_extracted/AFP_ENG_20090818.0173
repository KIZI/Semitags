Ireland reported Tuesday its second death of a person suffering from swine flu,
which has affected the Irish Republic far less than neighbouring Britain.

The patient died on Monday evening in eastern Ireland, said the Health Service
Executive (HSE), adding that the family had asked for no details to be released.

Ireland reported its first swine flu death on August 7, a woman who died in
Tallaght hospital in south Dublin.

Neighbouring Britain has been the hardest hit country in Europe by the swine flu
pandemic, with at least 49 deaths and hundreds of thousands of people infected.
