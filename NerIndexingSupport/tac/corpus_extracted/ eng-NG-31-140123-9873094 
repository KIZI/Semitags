Erickson has the Sun Devils on the march.  He's the coach the Devils
have been looking for since the days of Frank Kush.  ASU has two games
at home (Washington and Cal), two games on the road (Oregon and UCLA),
then two more games at home (USC and Arizona).

I'd guess that some in this group are too young to remember when the
Pac-10 was the Pac-8.  Arizona and ASU (my alma mater) were in the WAC.
But ASU upset Nebraska in the Fiesta Bowl and was invited, along with
Arizona, to join the Pac 8 (that's my recollection of it, anyway,
please correct me if I'm wrong).  That made it the Pac 10, and I reckon
they need two more teams and they can call it...*

There was talk in the media about adding Colorado and Texas.  No,
really, there was.  Does anyone remember?  In order to do that, they'd
have to use another meaning for "Pacific," like the NFL did when they
invented a new meaning for West.

Big game tomorrow.  Go Hawks!

*...two six pacs.
