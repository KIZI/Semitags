Texas Democrats seem upbeat despite again
facing uphill battles in November. But I think I've found a voice
of dissent.

Meet Jim Sharp, a Houston state appellate judge running for the
Texas Supreme Court as the Dems' challenger against the recently
appointed Debra Lehrmann, a Republican.

In an interview with the Austin American-Statesman editorial
board, Sharp expressed doubts about Democratic gubernatorial
nominee Bill White and deep skepticism about Linda Chavez-Thompson,
the party's nominee for lieutenant governor.

Chavez-Thompson is a former union leader who rose to national
AFL-CIO vice president. She was encouraged to run by Democrats who
thought a Hispanic female could attract Hispanics and females to
the polls. She beat former Travis County District Attorney Ronnie
Earle and local deli man Marc Katz in the primary and is a longshot
against GOP Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst.

Let's jump in where Sharp headed after he and I agreed that
Republicans do a good job of turning out their suburban voters.

"They vote. Our people don't vote. The Valley don't vote,"
Sharp said, adding, "We'll see if this big scheme they got of
putting Linda Chavez-Thompson on the ballot as lieutenant governor
... works out or not."

You sound skeptical, judge.
      "Yep."
      Why?
      "Remember my gravestone?"

At this point I must keep from you the colorful epitaph he said,
off the record, he'd like on his gravestone. It has to do with what
he sees as Democrats' penchant for interfering with what should be
a pleasurable experience.

Sharp set up his concerns about Chavez-Thompson by first talking
about the Democratic gubernatorial nominee.

"So we got Bill White. Great candidate. Competent as he can
be," he said, praising White's "skill set, the executive thing."

But Sharp does not believe that White's service as Houston's
mayor necessarily prepares him to be governor.

"I mean, to sit in the Governor's Mansion, you really ought to
have ... either served in the Legislature, either body, or held
some sort of statewide executive office or something. But just to
go from a mayor to the Governor's Mansion, I don't know. We'll see
if it works. I think he'll be good. I really do. We'll see. We'll
see.

"So we've got the governor covered. But then lieutenant
governor? Linda Chavez-Thompson?" he said. "I certainly don't
think so because I know the heart and soul of the people, but
others might describe this state as racist. So in a state that is
ostensibly racist and certainly red in terms of being Republicans,
and probably sexist, and it's a right-to-work state, anti-labor,
anti-union, they decide that putting a Hispanic, female, labor
organizer, boss, AFL-CIO vice president, national AFL-CIO vice
president ... (on the ticket) as lieutenant governor (is a good
idea). They think that's the way they want to work it.

"Are you trying to lose? Is this a recipe for complete
disaster?" he asked, adding. "I so hope I am wrong."

It doesn't sound like he believes he is, and Sharp thinks
Chavez-Thompson can help Democrats "if she spends all her time --
although I've seen her everywhere but there -- but if she spends
all her time in the Valley, south of San Antone, I mean just works
it, works it, works it, works it, and they'll spend some money
there."

"The other component of that was, well national labor will send
people in and money and that will help us as well. We'll have foot
soldiers and what not," Sharp said. "With the United States
Senate at risk, I don't think so. They could care less about
lieutenant governor of Texas. They're going to spend their
resources more providently than that."

"I love her," he said of Chavez-Thompson. "She's a tremendous
speaker. I just think it's the fit."

A better fit, he said, would have been a "conservative
Democratic businessperson, male or female."

"I mean if we could find a Democratic Kay Bailey," he said,
referring to GOP Sen. Hutchison. "That'd work. But not a labor
boss."

Sharp said he hasn't heard other Democrats questioning the
wisdom of the Chavez-Thompson candidacy.

Why are they unconcerned?

"Got different gravestones, I guess," he said, referring to
the epitaph I can't tell you about.
