Captain Ryan Jones has withdrawn injured and been replaced by Gloucester No. 8 Gareth Delve in a Wales team to be skippered by Martyn Williams against Ireland in the Six Nations this weekend.

Jones has been carrying a calf injury. Delve will earn his 10th cap but first since 2008.

Williams will captain Wales for the seventh time as he becomes the most capped Welsh forward with 95.

Hooker Matthew Rees also returns, bumping Huw Bennett to the reserves, and lock Luke Charteris will stay where he finished after replacing Deiniol Jones, who was injured during the 26-20 loss to France in the last round.

The only other changes by coach Warren Gatland are in the reserves, where scrumhalf Dwayne Peel was in for Mike Phillips, and lock Ian Gough backing up Charteris.
