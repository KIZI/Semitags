Here are 10 states wielding significant conservative clout in
the new Congress:

1. Texas. The Lone Star State has more Republican lawmakers than
any other, has four members of party leadership and has some of the
most conservative members of Congress.

2. California. Out with the San Francisco liberals and in with
the Southern California conservatives. California is home to the
No. 3 House leader, Kevin McCarthy, and four powerful committee
chairs.

3. Florida. Florida gained seven new Republican members of
Congress -- the most in the nation. The Sunshine State boasts a mix
of influential veterans and up-and-coming stars.

4. Ohio. House Speaker John Boehner will wield a tremendous
amount of clout. And he'll be joined by five new GOP House members
from Ohio, a new Republican senator and a GOP governor with close
ties to Capitol Hill.

5. Georgia. Georgia has the delegation with the most
conservative voting record (95 percent) of any large state. It also
has policymaking clout with Rep. Tom Price, the chair of the
Republican Policy Committee.

6. Virginia. Eric Cantor, the incoming House Majority Leader,
will be joined by three GOP freshmen from Virginia -- an Obama state
that went deep red in 2010.

7. Kentucky. The Bluegrass State has a one-two punch in Senate
Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Appropriations Committee
boss Hal Rogers. They know how to bring home the bacon -- if they're
allowed to.

8. Michigan. Michigan controls two key House panels: the
tax-writing Ways & Means Committee, with chairman Dave Camp, and
the House Energy & Commerce Committee, where Fred Upton unseated
Texan Joe Barton.

9. Tennessee. Sen. Lamar Alexander is the third-ranking Senate
Republican, and he's joined by a very conservative House
delegation, including three who captured Democratic seats.

10. South Carolina. The Palmetto State is home to two important
senators, maverick Lindsey Graham and hardline conservative hero
Jim DeMint, as well as a widely heralded freshman, African American
conservative Tim Scott.
