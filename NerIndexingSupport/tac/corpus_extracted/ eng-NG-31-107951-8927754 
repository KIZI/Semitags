I read all 84 pages. That is "read" not "analyzed in depth" or "researched." It
appears to be well reasoned, moderate, careful and prudent (TK will now call me
a retard or homo). There appears to be one very major different presumption that
made the difference between the majority and minority findings.

The majority ruling appears to say that judging this case by the very specific
rules given and presuming that all technical personnel testifying or performing
tests in this matter acted in good faith, they had no choice but to find that
the AAF alleged was valid, barely, under the broad and sloppy standards set by
WADA and despite the obvious problems and marginal competencies shown by LNDD.

The dissenting opinion (which I only scanned) seems based on a refusal to accept
the presumption that the lab was acting in good faith and finds against USADA
that the obvious sloppiness could cover up misconduct or permitted manipulation
of the results, which to his eyes appears to be the case.

Both positions are well supported.

Hopefully, LNDD, WADA and UCI will read the majority decision as something other
than vindication. I see it as a screaming, in their face wake up call to
promulgate stringent technical, administrative and ethical standards and meet
them. I would expect that another such trainwreck would completely destroy the
presumptions of competence and good faith that very narrowly decided this case.
