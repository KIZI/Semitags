Leaving behind a rant against the government,
big business and particularly the tax system, a 53-year-old
computer engineer smashed a small aircraft into an office building
where nearly 200 employees of the IRS were starting their workday
on Thursday morning, the authorities said.

Aside from the death of the pilot himself, identified as Joseph
Andrew Stack of North Austin, only two serious injuries were
reported in the crash and subsequent fire, which initially inspired
fears of a terrorist attack and drew nationwide attention.

But in place of the typical portrait of a terrorist driven by
ideology, Stack was described as generally easygoing, a talented
amateur musician with marital troubles and a maddening grudge
against the tax authorities.

"I knew Joe had a hangup with the IRS on account of them
breaking him, taking his savings away," said Jack Cook, the
stepfather of Stack's wife, in a telephone interview from his home
in Oklahoma. "And that's undoubtedly the reason he flew the
airplane against that building. Not to kill people, but just to
damage the IRS."

Within hours of the crash, before the death or even the identity
of the pilot had been confirmed, officials ruled out any connection
to terrorist groups or causes.

"The main thing I want to put out there is that this is an
isolated incident here; there is no cause for alarm," said the
Austin police chief, Art Acevedo, in a televised news conference at
midday. Asked how he could be sure, Acevedo said, "You have to
take my word at it, don't you?"

As the Department of Homeland Security opened an investigation
and President Barack Obama received a briefing from his
counterterrorism adviser, John O. Brennan, federal officials
emphasized the same message, describing the case as a criminal
inquiry.

Since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the threat of terrorists
using airplanes to crash into buildings has raised a special sort
of public anxiety, as in 2006, when a Yankees pitcher and his
flight instructor died in a crash in Manhattan.

Stack's aircraft, a single-engine, fixed-wing Piper PA-28-236
registered in California, took off from the Georgetown Municipal
Airport, about 25 miles north of Austin, at 9:40 a.m., the Federal
Aviation Administration said.

At 9:56, the plane tore into a seven-story office building at
9430 Research Boulevard, about seven miles northwest of the State
Capitol, local authorities said. Flames and smoke engulfed the
building, sending big black burned panels to the ground. Emergency
medical officials said two men were injured, both in the fire. One
was transported to a burn unit in San Antonio. A third office
worker was described only as "unaccounted for."

Aside from the IRS, private organizations including an education
center affiliated with St. Edward's University maintain offices in
the building, according to address records. The local office of the
FBI is in a separate part of the complex.

"We can confirm that the building that the plane hit this
morning includes IRS offices," said Terry L. Lemons, a spokesman
for the agency. "We have about 190 employees that work at those
offices. We're still in the process of accounting for everyone."

In a six-page statement signed "Joe Stack (1956-2010)" and
posted on a Web site connected to Stack's wife, the author singled
out the tax agency as a source of suicidal rage, concluding,
"Well, Mr. Big Brother IRS man, let's try something different,
take my pound of flesh and sleep well."

Though profane at points, the statement articulated grievances
with specific sections of the tax code, corporations, politicians
and a local accountant. It appeared to have been written with some
deliberation. At one point, the verbs "left" and "abandoned"
appeared side by side, seemingly an editing choice never settled.

From relatives, friends and neighbors, a portrait of Stack
emerged as a man pushed over the brink by retirement dreams
deferred through a protracted series of financial setbacks.

By the account of Cook, Stack was raised in an orphanage in
Hershey, Pa., with a brother and sister, leaving the orphanage
after high school to attend college. He worked as a software
engineer in California, learned to fly and played guitar and piano
for recreation. He moved to Austin, playing with a band and at
informal gatherings.

In the mid-2000s, Stack met Cook's stepdaughter, the former
Sheryl Housh, through musician friends in Austin. After eight
months of friendship, they dated and married about three years ago.
Both had been previously married.

Sheryl Stack, 50, listed in records at the University of Texas
as a graduate student in music performance, brought her own strange
back story to the marriage, having spent several years in the sway
of a religious cult before her parents orchestrated a rescue.

On visits to Oklahoma, Joseph Stack took his new in-laws up in
his plane. He never spoke of his troubles with the IRS, though his
wife related them. The family assembled in Austin at Christmas, and
Stack seemed fine, Cook said.

But in recent weeks Sheryl Stack complained to her parents of an
increasingly frightening anger in her husband, straining the
marriage, Cook said. On Wednesday night, Sheryl Stack took her
12-year-old daughter, Margaux, to a hotel to get away from her
husband.

They returned on Thursday morning to find their house ablaze,
their belongings destroyed. Officials said the house fire was
deliberately set, casting Joseph Stack as the primary suspect. But
by that point he was gone, airborne.

"This is a shock to me that he would do something like this,"
Cook said. "But you get your anger up; you do it."
