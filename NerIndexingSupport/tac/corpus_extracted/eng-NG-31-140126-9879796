DAVIE, Fla. -- Miami Dolphins linebacker Derrick Pope missed practice
Saturday after being hospitalized for undisclosed reasons.
Dolphins coach Cam Cameron said the team was "gathering information" but he
did not know why Pope was in the hospital. The Dolphins did not immediately
disclose the name of the hospital.

"Obviously, Derrick is somebody we care a lot about and I'll find out more,
but I don't want to speculate as to what the situation is and we'll update
you once we get more information," Cameron said at the news conference
Saturday.

Pope's status for Monday night's game against the Pittsburgh Steelers was
unclear. He has started at outside linebacker for the past five games.

If Pope cannot start, he most likely will be replaced by Donnie Spragan,
Cameron said.
