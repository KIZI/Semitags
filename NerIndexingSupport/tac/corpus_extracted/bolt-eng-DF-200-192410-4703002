Hey,

Right I'm a girl, just to clarify, and I've had a complex about my forehead for a few years now. I was curious to know if many people have measured their foreheads to see how big or small they are.

Just helps me know if I'm average or, as suspected, have a huge forehead.

Thanks,

I can't say i've ever measured my forehead... You won't be able to change it anyway so don't need to worry.
 
 
Isn't it meant to be as big as the width of your hand? Mine's a bit smaller than that. Just tried it  
 
 
I know you can't change it but you curious as to if I have to be so religious about covering it lol.

They say between 3 -5 fingers is average... but everyone's hands are different :L.

Yeahh,, but it means you would be in proportion.

OP, surely what you are concerned about isn't the actual measurement of your forehead, but the size compared to the rest of your face?
 
 
Yeah that makes more sense :L

So potentially my forehead takes over my face :L

fringe? / sidefringe? / hat?

That's how I cope with mine, and I've found accentuating eyes and eyebrows with makeup helps make your fod seem smaller.
 
 
yeah I have a fringe, when it grows I keep it as a side fringe until I get it cut. But it's still depressing lol.

I just remember someone commenting on it when I was younger and since then I've been paranoid :/

Is it just you who is self concious about it or do other people say anything?
 
 
I have a big forehead. Not in terms of height but it sticks out. Its the somaliness in me.

People don't say anything but they might think it?

Yeah I know who OP is lol, but I don't think it matters so much with guys, without being sexist.

But big foreheads don't seem very feminine?

I think just under a third of my face is forehead... oh dear :L

x
 
 
I have a rather proud fivehead  

However, a lot of models and pop stars and suchlike who people find attractive are known for the size of their foreheads, so it's not all bad. And I think other people will never really notice it as much as you do.  
 
 
I have a large forehead.

I have a fringe and long hair though so you can't tell.
 
 
I know people can be self-conscious but seriously don't worry. There's nothing you can do to change your forehead, just wear your hair down and make sure your eyebrows always look good.
 
 
Rhianna has a "large" forehead and she's a babe!

Large(ish) foreheads can give girls a kind of cute babyish look.

I was bullied for years because I have a high forehead, I've had a side fringe since I was about 13 to help break it up and now nobody cares.
A (male) friend of mine also admitted that he has a massive forehead complex, and he won't get his hair cut short enough that anyone can see it.
You just gotta learn to accept yourself as you are, you can't change it, and anyone worth your time really doesn't care anyway. If anyone says anything mean about it then it's just because they can't think of anything else to tease you about really.
If a fringe helps you feel less self-conscious (as is the case for me and my friend, and seemingly you) then have a fringe. Don't worry about it.

He's still gorgeous...

Edit: Also, someone mentioned Rihanna, and she is amazing!

:L that made me crack up.

I always got told I look young for my age, I'm 19 in a week and everyone always says I have a really girly and babyish face. Worst thing is people use the word cute... I hate being called cute, I am not cute lol.

Thanks for the all comments though!

"In order to support itself, Rihanna's forehead must have a total caloric intake of 120 million calories. That translates to about 577 buffalo wings from actual angelic buffaloes, 27 obese females, 21 obese males, a can of paint, a tub of discarded fat from liposuction victims, Jared before the Subway train incident, elevenedy-seven Big Macs, all the Mountain Dew that forms on the windward side on Mount Everest in the morning, 2 French fries, the Michellen Man, Michelle Wie, and/or 11 steeplejacks, and of course 55 gallons of guava juice."

Aha...
 
 
I have a huge forehead but it's the one part of my body that I can't do anything about, so don't worry about it  
 
 
I have a long egg shaped head and a large forehead- very hot lol  . If I stare at my face long enough I'll say my nose is too big and juts out at a funny angle, my lips are too thin and my cheekbones are too high so accentuates my long face.

But generally my face is ok. It's so easy to overanalyse things.  
 
 
Some great replies, made me chuckle. Can’t say my forehead is particularly big but other bits are bigger than I’d sometimes like! Best to focus on the bits you do like!

NPH is awesome  

I have quite a large forehead, but I side fringe it  
 
 
I have the opposite problem, my forehead is tiny and looks really weird! It is covered with my fringe at all times, some people say I look like a different person without a fringe! Thank god I have big purple hair that disguises it!

I know right  
Side fringes are awesome too.
 
 
My forehead is huge... 7cm in the middle part, although my hairline kind of comes down in the middle and receeds back a bit (if you can imagine a sweetheart neckline on a dress - it does that kind of thing) so at the part where my hair goes back the furthest, it's 8cm deep. It doesn't stick out - it's just high. But the rest of my face is long as well so I don't think it looks too out of proportion.

Numerous comments have been made about my forehead behind my back and a group of very immature boys decided to post a picture of me on facebook (where admittedly my forehead was looking particularly big) and compare it to a fairly amusing picture of an alien which an abnormally large forehead, concluding that mine was bigger (aren't some boys immature?!).

... All that said, I still wear my hair back in a ponytail without a side fringe to cover it and that's how I plan on keeping it for the time being. Besides, look how far Tyra Banks got!
 
 
I have a huuuuge forehead, I've got a fringe and I used to be really insecure about it but I'm not as bothered anymore now I'm good with make up and things.   I even wear a quiff sometimes.   I find having well groomed eyebrows - but not too thin - and defined eyes takes all the attention away.

Besides, have you seen Christina Ricci?

You look beautiful in your profile picture though.  

Mine is also mahoosive (forehead that is   ) Though my face is dodgy in general. It's not so much that's it's high but my hairline like recedes a hell of a lot. It's got corners and everything. One of these days I'll be brave enough to have a fringe and cover up the bugger. I prefer the side swept ones but they won't cover it up right because it'll only cover one 'corner'.
....I'm not explaining this very well am I?

That makes sense. Mine receeds as well but comes down in the middle. Although I suppose it's not receeding because it's not constantly going backwards, it's always been far back.

I know what you mean about getting a fringe, and I've thought about one too, but (1) I have cowslick which means fringes kink on me (haha, I got some seriously messed up genes when it came to the top of my head!) and (2) I'd only be getting one to cover up my forehead, not because I really want one for some other reason, and that doesn't seem like a good enough reason to me! But then I'm just stubborn so please feel free to ignore that.  

Thanks, by the way.

As she mentioned it... you could stand in for a younger Olivia Wilde (House, Coybows & Aliens), which by the way is a compliment!  

 
 
 
3 fingers here!

  Thanks! A compliment indeed (just need to work on the body now...   ).

EDIT: Thinking about it, that's the second time someone on here has told me I look like Olivia Wilde.... (or it could have been you twice, I suppose!   )

Hah same here! I'm not a big fan of fringes really, especially the big thick straight ones so I'd only get one to stop me being so self conscious which is a bit nuts really.  
 
 
I have a huge forehead and I used to cover it up with a heavy fringe and be terrified of wind blowing it. Then I grew up and grew out my fringe, it doesn't look bad at all. I think I'd rather have a forehead that's too big than one that is too small. I think I looked much more ridiculous when I was so paranoid than I do now.

It's all about confidence really.
 
 
from the middle of my forehead it measures from the hairline to where the brow would be (don't have uni brow) it's 7cm. I'm a guy, I don't consider myself to have a large forehead but my friend has a small one and I'm quite average.
