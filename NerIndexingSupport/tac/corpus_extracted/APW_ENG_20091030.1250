It's another boy for Colin Farrell.

A spokeswoman for the 33-year-old Irish-born actor said Friday that Farrell and Polish actress Alicja Bachleda welcomed son Henry Tadeusz Farrell on Oct. 7. The couple met while filming "Ondine."

Farrell has a 6-year-old son, James Padraig Farrell, with model Kim Bordenave. Farrell won a Golden Globe earlier this year for his role as a hit man in "In Bruges."
