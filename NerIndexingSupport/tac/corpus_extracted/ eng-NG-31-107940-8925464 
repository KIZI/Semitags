The New and Enlightened Federal Aviation Administration of
the Bush Administration has stated on many occasions they
want to run more like a "Business" and be more receptive
to the airlines and the airline business model. Really? OK

IF AIRLINES SOLD PAINT

Customer: Hi. How much is your paint?
Clerk: Well, sir, that all depends on quite a lot of things.
Customer: Can you give me a guess? Is there an average price?
Clerk: Our lowest price is $12 a gallon, and we have 60
different prices up to $200 a gallon.
Customer: What's the difference in the paint?
Clerk: Oh, there isn't any difference; it's all the same paint.
Customer: Well, then I'd like some of that $12 paint.
Clerk: When do you intend to use the paint?
Customer: I want to paint tomorrow. It's my day off.
Clerk: Sir, the paint for tomorrow is the $200 paint.
Customer: When would I have to paint to get the $12 paint?
Clerk: You would have to start very late at night in about 3
weeks. But you will have to agree to start painting before
Friday of that week and continue painting until at least Sunday.
Customer: You've got to be *&%#@* kidding!
Clerk: I'll check and see if we have any paint available.
Customer: You have shelves FULL of paint! I can see it!
Clerk: But it doesn't mean that we have paint available. We
sell only a certain number of gallons on any given weekend.
Oh, and by the way, the price per gallon just went to $16.
We don't have any more $12 paint.
Customer: The price went up as we were talking?
Clerk: Yes, sir. We change the prices and rules hundreds of
times a day, and since you haven't actually walked out of
the store with your paint yet, we just decided to change. I
suggest you purchase your paint as soon as possible. How
many gallons do you want?
Customer: Well, maybe five gallons. Make that six, so I'll
have enough.
Clerk: Oh no, sir, you can't do that. If you buy paint and
don't use it, there are penalties and possible confiscation
of the paint you already have.
Customer: WHAT?
Clerk: We can sell enough paint to do your kitchen,
bathroom, hall and north bedroom, but if you stop painting
before you do the bedroom, you will lose your remaining
gallons of paint.
Customer: What does it matter whether I use all the paint? I
already paid you for it!
Clerk: We make plans based upon the idea that all our paint
is used, every drop. If you don't, it causes us all sorts of
problems.
Customer: This is crazy!! I suppose something terrible
happens if I don't keep painting until after Saturday night!
Clerk: Oh yes! Every gallon you bought automatically becomes
the $200 paint.
Customer: But what are all these, "Paint on sale from $10 a
liter" signs?
Clerk: Well that's for our budget paint. It only comes in
half-gallons. One $5 half-gallon will do half a room. The
second half-gallon to complete the room is $20. None of the
cans have labels, some are empty and there are no refunds,
even on the empty cans.
Customer: To heck with this! I'll buy what I need somewhere
else!
Clerk: I don't think so, sir. You may be able to buy paint
for your bathroom and bedrooms, and your kitchen and dining
room from someone else, but you won't be able to paint your
connecting hall and stairway from anyone but us. And I
should point out, sir, that if you paint in only one
direction, it will be $300 a gallon.
Customer: I thought your most expensive paint was $200!
Clerk: That's if you paint around the room to the point at
which you started. A hallway is different.
Customer: And if I buy $200 paint for the hall, but only
paint in one direction, you'll confiscate the remaining paint?
Clerk: No, we'll charge you an extra use fee plus the
difference on your next gallon of paint. But I believe
you're getting it now, sir.
Customer: You're insane!
Clerk: Thanks for painting with United!
