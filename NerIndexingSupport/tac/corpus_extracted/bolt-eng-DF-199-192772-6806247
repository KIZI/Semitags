 
 
Does Plato's Republic Propose A Rigid Class System?
 
 
When I first learned about Plato in high school, I was disappointed by the division of human beings into gold, silver, and iron or brass.

 
While all of you in the city are brothers, we will say in our tale, yet God in fashioning those of you who are fitted to hold rule mingled gold in their generation, for which reason they are the most precious—but in the helpers silver, and iron and brass in the farmers and other craftsmen. And as you are all akin, though for the most part you will breed after your kinds.
-The Republic, 415
 

Even worse, it seemed that the best interests of the state require that individuals "know their place."

 
Think, now, and say whether you agree with me or not. Suppose a carpenter to be doing the business of a cobbler, or a cobbler of a carpenter; and suppose them to exchange their implements or their duties, or the same person to be doing the work of both, or whatever be the change; do you think that any great harm would result to the State?
Not much.
But when the cobbler or any other man whom nature designed to be a trader, having his heart lifted up by wealth or strength or the number of his followers, or any like advantage, attempts to force his way into the class of warriors, or a warrior into that of legislators and guardians, for which he is unfitted, and either to take the implements or the duties of the other; or when one man is trader, legislator, and warrior all in one, then I think you will agree with me in saying that this interchange and this meddling of one with another is the ruin of the State.
Most true.
Seeing then, I said, that there are three distinct classes, any meddling of one with another, or the change of one into another, is the greatest harm to the State, and may be most justly termed evil-doing?
Precisely.
And the greatest degree of evil-doing to one's own city would be termed by you injustice?
Certainly.
This then is injustice; and on the other hand when the trader, the auxiliary, and the guardian each do their own business, that is justice, and will make the city just.
-The Republic, 434
 

Am I being overly negative? Plato's Republic was required reading in both high school and college. I felt it was over-rated.
 
 
@wandeljw,

And a caste system...
 
 
@wandeljw,

I agree; it's over-rated.
 
 
i'd be more inclined to use Lego or Mechano to propose a rigid class system, Play Doh is probably to malleable
 
 
Yeah, a class system that was too inflexible by far. What's ironic is that such a system would not have been able to produce a Socrates, as his training was in stone-cutting and would not have been allowed to become a philosopher, much less a philosopher-king.

On the other hand, it does have its strong points, such as the equality of women and...and...and...Anyway, it does have its strong point.

I had to re-read it recently for a grad school class. Somebody, maybe the translator, was convinced that Plato relied heavily on irony and oblique allusion in the Republic, most of which is lost to us today. As a result, much that we take literally wasn't meant to be taken so. I dunno. That's just what he said.
 
 
What I found most interesting is that it's required reading in your schools. It's not that way over here. It's really only people studying classics, or perhaps politics and philosophy that would have to study it. Even then we're really talking about higher education.

I think the reason for this was that republicanism was seen as a fairly new idea when America was first formed. By studying Plato you give republicanism a sense of history. Politics isn't really studied at all over here. It pops up in History and English, but by and large it's something you would opt to study post 16.
 
 
@izzythepush,

Sorry not true at all as most of the US founding fathers was very aware of the early Rome Republic and it history and when writing under pen names they more often then not took the names of famous Romans of that time period.

Edward Gibbon's Books on the subject of Rome was in most of their libraries.

And of course Plato books was also well known to them.
 
 
@wandeljw,

To assume that any society will be in harmony if the three classes of people lived as they should is untrue from the very nature of humans. In most cultures, military power was the driving force of society. They controlled the government and the people.

We can also look at our own form of government where the leaders have come from modest backgrounds. Many tyrannical leaders of today took over their government by force; not from being from royalty or from any leadership group or through legal elections.

I'm not sure how Plato's idea of some craftsmens who work with certain kinds of tools must perpetuate their craft through their children to maintain any sort of political harmony.
 
 
@BillRM,

Sorry Bill, I'm not trying to make allegations about your founding fathers. This was an era in which the divine right of kings was believed throughout most of Europe. I'm just saying nascent republicanism was the exception and not the rule in 1776. The political systems in Europe were well established, republicanism wasn't.

Ok. Why do you think that Plato's Republic is studied in schools in America, but barely gets a mention in the UK?

I never study Plato Republic in school and read if only once in my late teens and 40 plus years later sadly do not remember any of it.

Guess I should download it from Guenberg and reread it.

I do remember that the Paine Book "The Age of Reason" was never brought up during my public school education in the US or Jefferson edited version of the Bible and I had aways assume that was due to the wish to sell US students on the idea that the founders the to man were all deeply religion.
 
 
@BillRM,

I'm a bit confused here. From the beginning of the thread I was lead to believe it was a set text. You do seem to be far more familiar with it as a nation than we are though.

I've read Paine's Right's of Man, and Common Sense, but that's only because I did American Studies at Uni. By the way, the town of Lewes about fifty miles down the road from me, issues banknotes with Thomas Paine's face on them. These can only be used in the town of Lewes.
 
 
@izzythepush,

Maybe I gave a false impression. Specific teachers that I had in high school and college asked us to read Plato's Republic. It may have been the teachers themselves rather than the school system.
 
 
@wandeljw,

Thank you. There are real differences in the way we do things each side of the pond. One thing that interests me is the pledge of allegience. Is it something that has to be done every day at school?
 
 
Plato's Republic was probably more supportive of monarchies than democracies. Plato's ruling class seemed to be privileged. Plato's focus on having wise philosophers as rulers was probably the wrong focus. We can assume that many rulers will be mediocre or just plain bad. An ideal system of government would construct institutions that allow a society to survive a bad ruler.
 
 
@wandeljw,

Isn't the main problem in all of this human nature. People don't always act in a logical manner. Over here we've just had a referendum on AV. This is a question about our constitution, and should be looked at objectively. That's not what happened. The main beneficiaries of AV would be the Liberal Democrats, they abandoned, and broke most of their election promises to enter in a coalition with the Conservatives. All of the 'No to AV' campaign literature had picture of Nick Clegg the Liberal Democrat leader. So people voted No to AV not because they thought the constitutioal change was a bad idea, but because the wanted to punish Nick Clegg
 
 
I wasn't trolling about the pledge of allegiance. It's something I'm really interest. Over here the only people who have to pledge an oath are members of the armed forces, and immigrants taking the citizenship test, and that's a really recent development. Having taught in English schools I can't see a situation where it would be at all possible to get our teenagers to pledge allegience to anything.
 
 
@wandeljw,

I have read, in more than one source, that Plato based his republic on the Laconic state commonly known as Sparta. It (Sparta) was a slave state, and a right paranoid one, too. I agree with you that Plato's republic was less than admirable.

In the 1960's, I was required to recite the pledge of allegiance in elementary school only. I don't believe it is required in later schooling.

Plato seems to have admired Sparta and possibly had a grudge against Athenian democracy. His uncles were part of the oligarchy overthrown to make way for democracy.
 
 
@wandeljw,

I wouldn't be too quick to attribute democratic virtue to Athens, however. Slavery was the disease of the ancient world, and it existed in Attica, too. Less than 10% of adult Attic males were eligible to vote--slaves, "foreigners" and those who were not freeholders within Athens could not vote. So, for example, you could be a successful famer in Attica, the descendant of generations of successful farmers in Attica, but if you did not own property within the city, you could not vote. That despite the fact that the city determined policy for the entire state. Attica was the territory within which Athens was located.

Still it is hard to beat their ratio of representatives to voters of one to 250, and their habit of trying their representatives at the end of their terms of office... Understanding that when we had much less of resources we could afford one representative in our congress for every 30k, and now, under the influence of party, that number is fixed, and today the ratio exceeds one rep for 600+K though our resources have grown many times over; you can see how we have been robbed of the most essential part of representative government, and that is: representation...
 
 
@Fido,

Isn't one of the other problems with democracy that our representatives only seem to be concerned with the electorate when it comes to elections. For the rest of the time they're fairly free to do what they want
 
 
The establishment of "democracy" in Athens was nothing more than an expansion of the oligarchy. Property requirements for the franchise simply make the oligarchy plutocratic rather than aristocratic. England's first reform bill simply expanded a limited franchise based on property by a limited lessening of the property requirement. The best work of the first reform bill was the elimination of rotten boroughs--otherwise is was just a plutocratic expansion of the oligarchy.

It's hilarious to assert that trying people at the expiration of a term of office represents some democratic innovation at Athens. The Athenians were legendarily petty and suspicious with one another. To institutionalize back-stabbing hardly qualifies as some sort of democratic innovation.

They should be held responsible, and tried as Athens once did; but part of the problem of limiting representation is that they have already hung the jury... They Gerrimand their districts to give one party the edge by five percent consistently even when it puts them in danger of losing to some one even more radical left or right in the primaries... They may give the blacks or the other party a district with a 90% party majority so they can take five or six by a reliable margin... What ever they do, even if it means going agsint the majority in their districts they can mark up to principal... How about going back to the way we started, and sending everyone with overwhelming support and plenty of them and let them fight it out there as they should... If we really want democracy we have a long way to go, but having ever less representatives in ratio or ever more people is not going to get us there... They limited, the parties limited the number of representatives to make the house managable... Where does it say in the preamble of the constitution that managable government was ever the goal... I want government to manage our problems, and not be managed by the parties...

Ya; and they did not always actually vote for candidates, but cast lots to decide who was going to lead, trusting in fate, but no less holding those in charge responible... Plato and his creation: Socrates though they had evidence enough in the surrounding people, did not have enough knowledge of democracy to judge it... They could not understand what they were seeing in the Illiad, for example... They could not understand how money corrupted the city and the people... One of the rich complained that you could not strike a slave on the street in Athens for fear you might hit a citizen... Just as in Rome, the slaves in one hand empoverished the free people... Just as in this land, political equality is impossible to maintain in the face of economic inequality, and economic equality is an essential element in any true democracy... Eventually the rich through the benefit of fortune begin to believe they are more worthy of office and leadership, and to some degree they are correct... It was the poor who led Athen into the Pelopennisian war... Why??? For the poor without hope, war always offers the hope of spoils and glories... They were dispossessed of all except their citiizenship, but they would have been better fighting for democracy at home rather than against tyranny abroad... Only when all the people are united, and all fighting for their commonwealth will they make good political descisions... When wealth meant education as it does today, it is far to easy to justigy the rabble democracy on the basis of their want of education...
 
 
@Fido,

Sounds like what's happening in all levels of government; money = corruption.
 
 
I suggest, not without historical support, that what lead Athens into the Peloponnesia war was the invasion of Attica by Sparta and her allies. But don't let me spoil your fun.
 
 
@Setanta,

Oh we won't Setanta. You needn't worry about that.

I think Plato's idealistic utopias resulted from a search for something, anything, different stemming from his disgust at his much admired teacher being sentenced to death for corrupting the youth with enquiries into the scientific method.

Don't confuse the bigining with the causes that led up to it... Athens was all over the nediteranian supporting democratic forces against oligarchic which were Sparta's natural allies... The condition of landless free men in some of those city states was little better than that of a slave... In fact, one of Plato's dialogues deals with just such an issue, where a son brings his father before the court in Athens for the killing of a free man who had killed the father's slave... It was not to convict the father, in all likelyhood, but to clear him of possible charges in the future...
Throughout Hellas the rich who had gained control of their economies and so, all of the propert,y simply wanted all the rights to government, as occured in our own middle ages... The effect is the same here, where money is a necessity to turn the head of government, and the people are divided on purpose between the parties, unable to act effectively in defense of their own rights... The situation is unlikely to get better until it gets much worse, and cannot get much worse without destroying us...
 
 
@Fido,

You're living in fantasy land. Read up on the Delian League sometime. Athens was increasingly tyrannical, leading to the revolt of the hegemonic clients they had co-opted. Those people, who ought to have been their allies, were enraged at generations of being mulcted to support the Athenian empire, and they responded by standing aside as Athens was brought down, in those cases in which they didn't actually join in the attack.

You just make this shit up as you go along, don't you? Thanks for the laughs, Bubba.

They did not kill him for that, and they had every right to kill him for his pro spartan behavior... I think it may have also had something to do with him and his friends knocking the dinks off all the Hermes statues which was thought to have doomed one Athenian adventure... Been a while, but next log on I can try to tell which one...

I agree with much of what you say... Yet the way that was expressed was in radical democracy... The democratic element found their position deteriorating in Athens, but made the fight for it abroad, much as we are doing today when in fact, the fight should be made here... It is those with the money who most resisted seeing it go to Athens, and in Athens that was the very group that had the most to lose by war, and who resisted it the most..

I have a good book on the subject I would recommend, called a War like No Other... And it did come as close to total war as can be imagined... And while the System of government enjoyed by Sparta did give it some advantages as a slave state, inevitably, its cruelty to even its own people and the enemies it made with its successes doomed it... Think of it: Ten Helots for every man woman and child Spartan, and doomed by a constitution no one could change... That is what our world will look like some day, when all those little people who once tipped their hats to us instead resist us and fight us at every opportunity...
 
 
The concept of philosopher-king, as described in Plato's Republic sounds very elitist and expresses contempt for the common masses.

 
“Unless,” said I, “either philosophers become kings in our states or those whom we now call our kings and rulers take to the pursuit of philosophy seriously and adequately, and there is a conjunction of these two things, political power and philosophic intelligence, while the motley horde of the natures who at present pursue either apart from the other are compulsorily excluded, there can be no cessation of troubles, dear Glaucon, for our states, nor, I fancy, for the human race either. Nor, until this happens, will this constitution which we have been expounding in theory ever be put into practice within the limits of possibility and see the light of the sun."
-The Republic, 473
 
 
 
@wandeljw,

I don't see how anybody can object to that wande. The advice was ignored and there has been no cessation of troubles. What might have looked like cessations were only re-tooling intervals. And there have been no cessations at all in the class and sexual politics sections.

I think the NCSE takes the same position although it only usually shows itself in it's subscribers and other dupes. The "motley crew" and the "common masses" are often castigated on the evolution threads in only slightly less plain terms. Three times in the last 24 hours at least. I might have forgotten some. It's the general subtext anyway.

It isn't actually a bad thing in principle. Huxley has a version in BNW. We look to be in transition towards it. Elections being spectacles in essence these days. As if we can find the best leaders in a pool shrunk down to the last few who have no skeletons in their cupboards. Christianised skeletons at that.

When I think of the number of ladies who would dart out of the shadows if they saw me making a State of the Union speech I realise I wouldn't get past the first vetting stage.
 
 
In Plato's Republic, only a select few are wise enough to rule. This select few is able to stay aloof from the "madness of the multitude."

 
And when persons who are unworthy of education approach philosophy and make an alliance with her who is in a rank above them, what sort of ideas and opinions are likely to be generated? Will they not be sophisms captivating to the ear, having nothing in them genuine, or worthy of or akin to true wisdom?

No doubt, he said.

Then, Adeimantus, I said, the worthy disciples of philosophy will be but a small remnant: perchance some noble and well-educated person, detained by exile in her service, who in the absence of corrupting influences remains devoted to her; or some lofty soul born in a mean city, the politics of which he contemns and neglects; and there may be a gifted few who leave the arts, which they justly despise, and come to her;—or peradventure there are some who are restrained by our friend Theages’ bridle; for everything in the life of Theages conspired to divert him from philosophy; but ill-health kept him away from politics. My own case of the internal sign is hardly worth mentioning, for rarely, if ever, has such a monitor been given to any other man. Those who belong to this small class have tasted how sweet and blessed a possession philosophy is, and have also seen enough of the madness of the multitude; and they know that no politician is honest, nor is there any champion of justice at whose side they may fight and be saved. Such an one may be compared to a man who has fallen among wild beasts—he will not join in the wickedness of his fellows, but neither is he able singly to resist all their fierce natures, and therefore seeing that he would be of no use to the State or to his friends, and reflecting that he would have to throw away his life without doing any good either to himself or others, he holds his peace, and goes his own way. He is like one who, in the storm of dust and sleet which the driving wind hurries along, retires under the shelter of a wall; and seeing the rest of mankind full of wickedness, he is content, if only he can live his own life and be pure from evil or unrighteousness, and depart in peace and good-will, with bright hopes.
-The Republic, 496
 
 
 
In Plato's Republic, radical measures are proposed to establish an ideal state. The policies seem designed to kill individualism.

 
They will begin by sending out into the country all the inhabitants of the city who are more than ten years old, and will take possession of their children, who will be unaffected by the habits of their parents; these they will train in their own habits and laws, I mean in the laws which we have given them: and in this way the State and constitution of which we were speaking will soonest and most easily attain happiness, and the nation which has such a constitution will gain most.
-The Republic, 541
 
 
 
What is also interesting in that passage is that those who do not dwell in the city are not considered to be a part of the state--they are not citizens. That was typical of the world of the Mediterranean in that era, q.v. the denial of the franchise to anyone in Attica who was not a freeholder of the city of Athens. Initially, the same circumstance held in Rome. Later, citizenship was extended well beyond the city of Rome, but that was in the principiate empire, when for the purposes of practical politics, it no longer mattered.
 
 
@Setanta,

What's the difference between that and releasing the mighty Mississippi onto the farmlands to save the city which is what CBS reported is about to happen shortly. Presumably because the city fathers skimped the levees or took a chance on there being no "once-in-a-century" flooding while they were in office.
 
 
@spendius,

They opened the spillwater sluice on our TV tonight.

Which places "that those who do not dwell in the city are not considered to be a part of the state--they are not citizens" in a proper historical perspective.

The rule of the city has been the cause of the demise of every civilisation so far. Which is something Plato had no knowledge of. Plato's Republic proposes its own extiction.

Come on hundreds of thousands people in harm way compare to hundreds and billions of property damage compare to millions.

Those farmers should be made whole however it would be insane not to flood farmlands in order to save population centers.
 
 
@BillRM,

Is this extreme weather going to continue? We've had a lot of flooding over here in the last few years, but we're not that far from the sea, yours hasn't got anywhere else to go. Is what we're calling flooding today going to be called a lake in fifty years time?
 
 
The flooding in Canada is an historical imperative which cannot be avoided--there were more than 160 floods considered disastrour in the 20th century in Canada. This just happens to be the first time that a decision was made to do the least harm to the fewest people.

In the Missouri-Mississippi-Ohio river system, levees have been built for upwards of two hundred years to protect property and fields, with the result that the water just gets shunted downstream. Further complicating the problem is the unrealistic fight of the Corps of Engineers to keep the Mississippi in its current river bed. Since the 1811-12 earthquakes, the Corps of Engineers has worked to attempt to keep the Mississippi in historical channels or to move it back to its historical channel (c.f., Robert E. Lee building wing coffer dams on the Illinois side to move the river back toward St. Louis, which otherwise would today be 15 miles or more from the river).

After the eathquakes, the river "wanted" to move into an old channel in the Achafalaya bayou. At that time, there was a centuries old deadfall which blocked entrance to the Achafalaya basin, but the Corps knew that the relentless action of the river would undermine it, the river would go into that channel, and Baton Rouge and New Orleans would have been left high and dry. So, eventually, the Old River Control Structure was built, and this is just one more factor which sends millions of cubic feet of water hurtling downriver to the Gulf, with Baton Rouge and New Orleans in its path.

The best thing to do would be to remove all the levees, and sorry 'bout your luck to those who have chosen to build in bottom land along the rivers; and then, too, to blow up the Old River Control Stucture and let the river go where it wants to go--Baton Rouge and New Orleans be damned. Of course, as that's the sensible thing to do, it won't get done.

When I first learned about Plato in high school, I was disappointed by the division of human beings into gold, silver, and iron or brass.

 
While all of you in the city are brothers, we will say in our tale, yet God in fashioning those of you who are fitted to hold rule mingled gold in their generation, for which reason they are the most precious—but in the helpers silver, and iron and brass in the farmers and other craftsmen. And as you are all akin, though for the most part you will breed after your kinds.
-The Republic, 415
 

thats not quite the whole section 415b

to add

True, I replied, but there is more coming; I have only told you half. Citizens, we shall say to them in our tale, you are brothers, yet God has framed you differently.

Some of you have the power of command, and in the composition of these he has mingled gold, wherefore also they have the greatest honour; others he has made of silver, to be auxillaries; others again who are to be husbandmen and craftsmen he has composed of brass and iron; and the species will generally be preserved in the children.

But as all are of the same original stock, a golden parent will sometimes have a silver son, or a silver parent a golden son.

And God proclaims as a first principle to the rulers, and above all else, that there is nothing which should so anxiously guard, or of which they are to be such good guardians, as of the purity of the race.

They should observe what elements mingle in their off spring; for if the son of a golden or silver parent has an admixture of brass and iron, then nature orders a transposition of ranks, and the eye of the ruler must not be pitiful towards the child because he has to descend in the scale and become a husbandman or artisan, just as there may be sons of artisans who having an admixture of gold or silver in them are raised to honour, and become guardians or auxiliaries. For an oracle says that when a man of brass or iron guards the State, it will be destroyed. Such is the tale; is there any possibility of making our citizens believe in it?

Not in the present generation, he replied; there is no way of accomplishing this; but their sons may be made to believe in the tale, and their sons' sons, and posterity after them.

I see the difficulty, I replied; yet the fostering of such a belief will make them care more for the city and for one another. Enough, however, of the fiction, which may now fly abroad upon the wings of rumour, while we arm our earth-born heroes, and lead them forth under the command of their rulers.
 
 
@BillRM,

 
Come on hundreds of thousands people in harm way compare to hundreds and billions of property damage compare to millions.
 

I wasn't offering a judgement Bill. I was simply comparing the hegemony of city over countryside over 2.5 thousand years using two objective situations.

The danger to BR and NO is surely caused by economic growth being had on the cheap. You have defined "insane" as a city man would naturally do.

The teaching of evolution in schools looks to be a similar case of the city dominating the countryside. So here is "social evolution" setting aside real evolution. And once you do that it is then necessary, in order to be consistent and avoiding the charge of hypocrisy, to discuss religious belief from a social evolution point of view as well. Which City-media does not wish to do.

Science doesn't switch from one discipline to another to suit circumstances.

I can't see that the people of BR and NO were in harm's way with a fortnight's notice. It is just the property. If they were in harm's way then so are the people living on the artificially flooded land. They are thrown in the river because the cities lost their bet. Plato vindicated.

Nonsense and there would had been no Plato in the first place without him living in a culture that had gone far beyond farming and toward major population centers.

Second the bulk of the human race are now living in areas of the planet that without the "artificial" tools of clothing and fire buildings and shelter buildings would be dead within hours or at most months.

So why are dams and flood walls and other such technology to allow us to live in a place we normally could not live any difference then the technology to created and handle fire?

We still have not learn to handle fire with complete safety but it is far too useful and needful to give up and so is the technology to control flooding so we can build cities near rivers.

Sometimes as a result we end up needing to allow farm land to flood instead of population centers where the act of relocating millions of people would one way or another likely cost the lives of more people then the number who are living in those farm lands even with our technology.

But Plato's culture tanked. The city is deadly. It sucks until there is nothing left to suck on. It's insatiable.

So you wish us to go back to being hunters/gathers in small tribes with an average life span of less then 30 years?

Even being low tech farmers end up needing the support of populations centers.
 
 
@BillRM,

That's what we are evolved like isn't it? If social evolution is your game why do you use natural evolution to discredit religion? From what you say Bill you should discuss religious belief from an exclusive social evolution point of view. And recommend others do the same. Otherwise some of us might think that you use natural evolution as a trick to discredit religion for personal reasons. Social evolution provides evidence that religion is fundamental to society and that organised religions are city based.

the city dominating the countryside

Does it now, most of the ordinary people were booted out of the countryside and into the city by the Enclosure Act. Half of the countryside is owned by people with swank apartments in Mayfair. You try telling that to people on my estate, (council) as opposed to your estate (probably Herefordshire.)
 
 
@spendius,

We need cities to exist as anything but hunters/gathers however it is not proven that we need religions in any similar manner.

In fact so far it would seem we are evolving away from such silliness with special note to Europe and it sharply declining believers populations.

We are going back into English history to 1773 or so?
 
 
@BillRM,

Look Bill--"silliness" is an assertion. You can't say religion is silly and then base an argument on such an important matter on it being silly. It's circular. When it comes to nonsense that's the real deal. It's really silly.

Scientific advice on diet would lead to a sharp decline in food consumption but that decline would not mean food was going out. That you live in a Christianised society might allow you to engage in activities which Christians don't approve of. You have no scenario in which everybody engages in those activities in an atheist world. You're comparing a fantasy with reality. You're having a free ride and playing at ducks and drakes with the future.

I am when I lock horns with Spendius.
 
 
@izzythepush,

I'm from the North West. The home of the industrial revolution. Winners of the FA Cup and the Premier League. We are being milked by fat cats in the south.

Ten or so years ago Lancashire was the most productive county in the UK both industrially and agriculturally. At the time our infant mortality rate was double that of bloody Herefordshire.

They even gerrymander our constituency boundaries to stop us having marginals. And no sooner do our MPs get to Westminster than they sell out to the flesh pots which are in plentiful supply in the sordid south. They even have to rig the banking system to keep going. And the housing market.

That makes my point.

Any belief system that is on the same logic and commonsense level as a believe in the tooth fairy is on it face silly.

No logical holes at all in so stating.

I live in a society who major founders such as Jefferson was far far from being Christian and who limit the abilities of Christians in the Constitution to interfere with us non-Christians.

A charming habit that they had been guilty of for most of their two thousands years history up to burning people alive to save their souls.

Now they are limited to such nonsense as trying to have pseudo-science taught as science in the public schools but given a free hand I am sure they would get those fire going again.
 
 
@spendius,

Your response would have greater credibility if you bothered to vote. As for the recent footballing success, again we're talking about rich overseas owners. If there was any justice in this world Stoke would have won. By the way I think you're losing focus. We're supposed to be discussing society, yet you seem to be describing your ideal woman. I quote,

It sucks until there is nothing left to suck on. It's insatiable.
 
 
@izzythepush,

There is not a soul alive who votes and retains credibility. Elections are for betting on. Plus other amusements.

Rich overseas owners are like sheep entering the shearing shed.

Stoke were second best throughout.

Discussions about society which eschew sport are crabbed and nowhere more so than in England.

My ideal woman scares me rigid.

So she's a dominatrix then?
 
 
@izzythepush,

No--they do what men want I heard.
 
 
@spendius,

Yeah, I'm sorry, you're no Max Mosely. I take it from your comments about Stoke you're more of a City fan than a United one?
 
 
@izzythepush,

I'm a fan of the team I bet on. They are just 22 well paid sandwich board men chasing a ball around a field. City were the better side.
 
 
@spendius,

Apparantly Peter Cook was a Spurs fan. He always bet against Spurs, so if they won he'd be happy as a fan, but if they lost he'd get a cash bonus. Makes sense in a funny sort of way.
 
 
@izzythepush,

It makes no sense to me.
 
 
@spendius,

It would make a lot of sense if you supported Southampton. If I'd done that a couple of seasons back I'd be a lot richer now. I must confess to never having visited Manchester, I've been to Liverpool and had a great time. I don't know what stopped me going to Manchester, not when you've got such great ambassadors for your wonderful city like Terry Christian and Liam Gallagher.
 
 
@izzythepush,

I don't come from Manchester. It's horrible. Lowry caught it just right.

Everybody likes Southampton. Lawry Mac, Strachan and Hoddle--amusing guys--and Osgood, Ramsey, Chivers, Wayman, Shilton, Shearer, Keegan, Ball, dear Matt and Mick Channon who showed he had other talents in a tougher game.

Great club.
 
 
@spendius,

Thank you very much. I had to choose the other day whether to upgrade to sky sports 1 or 2. It would have meant watching either Saints or England. I decided to opt for Saints, because I can't think of anyone in the England squad that's not an arsehole. Can I assume you're a Preston fan, as you mentioned them awhile back? If so I'm sorry that they were demoted this season. From what I remember they were a very good side, not an easy fixture by any means. Still, two years ago we were in the doldrums, relegated to League 1 with a 10 point deduction, a lot can happen in 2 years.

Talking about the playoffs I do not want Bournemouth to win. We've already got to face two clubs who hate us, Brighton and the Skates, and that's enough in my book. Also I don't really want the MK Dons to go up. It may be alright for sporting teams to switch cities in America, but this is perfidious Albion.
