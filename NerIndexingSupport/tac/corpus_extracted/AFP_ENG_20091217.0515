Romanian President Traian Basescu Thursday designated Emil Boc as interim prime
minister and asked him to form a new government before Christmas.

"I have signed the decree naming M. Boc as new Prime minister", Basescu said in
an address.

The newly re-elected president added he hoped the government could be sworn in
before December 23.

Liviu Negoita stood down as Romania's prime minister on Wednesday after only one
month in charge as the political deadlock continued following President
Basescu's recent re-election.

Since October however, the country has been led by an interim government after
the coalition between Basescu's liberal democrats and Mircea Geoana's social
democrats broke down.

Boc, 43, is a lawyer and head of the Democratic-Liberal party (PDL), became
prime minister in December 2008 when his PDL party formed a coalition with the
Social-Democrats.

The coalition collapsed on October 1 and his minority government fell on a no
confidence vote on October 13.

"Emil Boc is a man of dialogue who has been able in the past to take
responsibilities for difficult decisions" as Romania was plunged into a deep
recession, Basescu said.

The first task of the new government will be to adopt a draft budget for 2010 in
order to get new instalments from 20-billion-euro crucial aid package from the
International Monetary fund (IMF), the European Union and the World Bank.

In November, the IMF and the EU had decided to delay the next loan tranches
until a new government was formed, dealing a new blow to the heavily recession-
hit economy.
