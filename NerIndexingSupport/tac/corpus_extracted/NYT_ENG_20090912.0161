McDaniels: Mac Speedie?

Or will Josh be a one-syllable wonder in the first game like
Frank, Jack, Lou, John, Red, Dan, Wade and Mike before him?

Eight erstwhile Broncos head coaches won their inaugural
regular-season opener.

Only Mac Speedie was not successful, but there is an ...

These are the eight grand-opening Broncos coaches and the
results of their first first games: Frank Filchock, 1960, 13-10 at
Boston (Patriots); Jack Faulkner, 1962, 30-21 over San Diego; Lou
Saban, 1967, 26-21 at Boston; John Ralston, 1972, 30-17 over
Houston (Oilers); Red Miller, 1977, 7-0 over St. Louis (Cardinals);
Dan Reeves, 1981, 9-7 over Oakland; Wade Phillips, 1993, 26-20 at
New York (Jets); Mike Shanahan, 1995, 22-7 over Buffalo.

Josh McDaniels, 2009, ? at Cincinnati.

Speedie's 1965 Broncos lost at San Diego in 1965, 34-31, but the
asterisk is that Speedie had taken over as coach in the previous
season in the fifth game -- and won his debut, 33-7 over Kansas
City.

The Broncos had two interim coaches, if you don't count
Phillips, who was keeping the chair warm for two years until
Shanahan decided to come home. Ray Malavasi replaced the fired
Speedie in 1966 and lost his first game to the Jets 16-7, and Jerry
Smith coached the Broncos in five games (the first a 28-10 defeat
at K.C.) after Saban resigned in 1971.

In essence, brand-new Broncos coaches always win their first
regular-season opener.

Hello, Josh McDaniels. Welcome to the Queen City of the Plains,
the Dusty Old Cowtown, the Mile High City. Welcome to the Broncos
and the NFL as a head coach. Welcome to the region where millions
of Broncophiles -- and Shanahan and Miller -- will watch and judge
you. Welcome to the jungle.

Just win, kid!

Three of the past four coaches have led the Broncos to six Super
Bowls. The past five coaches had only six losing seasons from 1972
through 2008. The past four coaches did not have a losing record in
their first seasons.

Just win 9, Coach McD!

In the new millennium, the Broncos have finished with a winning
record six times and with 8-8 marks two other seasons (and 7-9 in
2007). In 21 of the past 32 seasons, the Broncos have won at least
nine games a season.

Just get to the postseason, Josh, by gosh!

Since 1977, Miller, Reeves, Phillips and Shanahan coached the
Broncos to the playoffs 17 times.

Just don't lose 12, J-Mac!

Beginning their 50th season, the Broncos have never lost 12
games in one season. Many people have predicted they will. The
Broncos have lost 11 games in four seasons (but only once since
1967).

Just win, baby, over Oakland!

The previous coach made it his life's work to beat the Raiders.
He did it 21 times in 28 games.

Just hang in there, Josh McDaniels.

Five of the past six noninterim coaches lasted at least four
seasons. Reeves spent 12 seasons in Denver as head coach, Shanahan
14.

Based on history, all McDaniels has to do is win 10 games by his
second season, go to the playoffs by his third season and get to
the Super Bowl soon after, then win back-to-back world championship
rings.

Even then, Josh eventually could be fired. Every coach except
Saban who preceded McDaniels was fired. Saban resigned in the 1971
season ... under pressure. Two Super Bowl victories and a third AFC
championship game as head coach, and three trips to the Super Bowl
as a top assistant with the Broncos could not save Shanahan. Three
Super Bowls and another AFC title game could not save Dan Reeves.

McDaniels' first game on Sunday will be at Paul Brown Stadium.
There are Kevin Bacon-like degrees of separation between Brown and
McDaniels. Brown coached Don Shula, who coached Ray Perkins, who
hired Bill Belichick, who hired McDaniels.

McDaniels is directly linked to his mentor Belichick, who was an
ill-dressed gofer for the Broncos in 1978.

The Broncos' 33-year-old rookie emphasizes that he has never
been associated with a losing team since he began playing football
in junior college. He has promised that the Broncos will be a
tough, disciplined team, a team with unique characteristics and
concepts on offense, a team improved beyond last season.

He has said if the Broncos don't utilize the hurry-up, no-huddle
offense by the third game, I can criticize him. If he doesn't win
by the third game, I will criticize him.

He has endured the most troubled, complex offseason in the
club's history since "The Dirty Dozen Episode" after the 1976
season when veterans leaked (to me) a letter they had presented to
ownership, declaring they had no confidence in coach/GM Ralston. He
would resign.

The Broncos would reach the Super Bowl in 1977.

W.W.J.D.W.J? What will Josh do without Jay?

Will the coach be Mac Speedie in defeat or McSpeedy to triumph?
Godspeed in the opener, Josh McDaniels.

As Broncos coach, there is no second chance for a first
impression in Cincy.
