 
 
The A2K football pool
 
 
The Rules are simple. No spread, just pick the winners. Also, pick the combined total score of the Monday night game as a tiebreaker.

The bet is $100 virtual dollars. The winner takes it all each week, to do with what they will.

Whoever picks the most winners takes it. The tiebreaker will be whoever comes closest to the combined total score of the Monday night game.

Oh, and the picks must be in by 1:00 EST sunday morning!!! If you get in after that, you will be ridiculed and beaten with a wet noodle.

And no going back and editing your damn post after the games!!! I'll be watching!

Okay?

The only thing that I really care about, as far as football goes, is that the Packers lose on a weekly basis. A dark cloud floats over me if the Packers win.

Golly, gee. I've never bet money on anything before. If I did (real or virtual) I'd go with Buffalo, Philly, Tennessee, Detroit, Green Bay, KC, Jacksonville, Minnesota, Denver, Seattle, NE, San Diego, Chicago and the Jets. Total points there: 33
Did I miss any games?
 
 
Nope. You're in for a hundred virtual bucks. Good luck!
 
 
Okay, so far we have four contestants, which means the pot is already four hundred bucks. Come on, any other takers? Step right up! That kind of money buys a lot of virtual groceries! Or a virtual weekend getaway maybe? Gus? Come on, throw your hat into the ring, people! Child of the Light, how about you? Let's see if you can pick football like you pick basketball.

I like the commentary Child.I think everyone should do a swami bit. I'm in, Kicky; but I'm cautious with my 100 bucks...I like to see the injury reports in Sundays paper.

I'll see you around noon tomorrow...and Kicky.

Bring cash. I don't go for no checks or I. O. U.'s
 
 
Cool! The master is in! I must say, I'm surprised none of you see that this is the week the Patriots go down.
 
 
A word of advice, Panzade. Pick the Steelers. It's a lock.
 
 
Steelers. At home. Pats. Record winning streak....hmmmm. I suspect this one game will seperate the wheat from the chaff.
 
 
Put me down for every single home team.

44 points
 
 
You gotta love a winning strategy. Gus has an angle...I gotta go back to the papers and see what Gus sees.
 
 
This is a week to circle the wagons when Tonto says:"what you mean we Kimosabe?

Green Bay-Hate picking my team to lose
Philadelphia-
Buffalo- Cardinals are hot but don't travel well
Minnesota
Tennessee
Indianapolis
Dallas-Can Detroit demolish the East?
Houston
Denver
Seattle
New England- Spread breaker
San Diego
Chicago
New York Jets-36
 
 
Cool! I was wondering if you were going to get in here before the games begin.

Okay then, I guess we have our final picks! Now let's watch some football!!!
 
 
I used to have respect for you pan...but the COWBOYS...what ya smokin' and can i get some :-)
 
 
Who's your team, Willow? And please don't say the Packers or I will lose all respect for you.
 
 
Unfortunately Gus I am a Chiefs fan...I couldn't even take comfort in our win last week...I really thought this year would be different but we seem to get all the guys who can't tackle...they are the team of my heart or at least the right ventricle..The Vikings are my Gut...
 
 
Sorry Babe, Panzade looks at the games with squinty-eyed pragmatism. There's no room in his heart for the weak in the pack...the wolves are outside his door.
 
 
OOPS!

The panz screws up royally. Saw Terry Glenn was out for the season...thought he played for Jets....picked Dallas...can we say...going down?
 
 
wishy washy is what i call it pan..lol...AND another interception thrown by Vinnie YES!
 
 
call it what you will...the Detroit pussycats haven't won the game yet...unless the time change gives you an insight that I don't have...
 
 
their defense will get the job done...and it's called female intuition..hasn't failed me yet :-)
 
 
i'd have a quick retort...but in the spirit of comradeship...
 
 
of course i forgot to use my sperm blocker today..so i could be wrong *wink*
 
 
 
Unfortunately Gus I am a Chiefs fan...
 

Priest Holmes makes my fantasy team good.
 
 
yes, another 2 TD;s for the Priest...

AND VINNIE THROWS ANOTHER INTERCEPTION!!!!
yes!

who drugged the Vikings??????
 
 
My Sunday is shattered
 
 
i have glue and duct tape pan :-)
 
 
My pics are solid...Ravens and Cardinals are gonna come back soon.
 
 
'ear...have another toke Child...
 
 
Heh, Cards are too far gone, but still hope for the Bollerites.
 
 
I BLOODY HATE the COWBOYS....It must be the time change that screwed me...at least the chiefs kicked butt.
 
 
3 INT'S Pack fans.
 
 
Wow, so far Panz is the swami of the day. 7 out of 8 for the early games. I still have a chance though. I got six!
 
 
Note to Kicky, make one of these threads during Basketball season and I will shine...I like to shine.
 
 
You got it, buddy.

By the way, is anyone else watching what the Steelers are doing to New England right now?
 
 
I am watching in disbelief.

Did you know that The Niners were only 3 picks away from getting Roethlisberger? What might have been...
 
 
Yeah Kicky...I'm not worthy...the Pats are in shock.

To be fair..I love to see an underdog doin their thing...and you gotta love Big Ben.

CONGRATS !
 
 
 
By the way, is anyone else watching what the Steelers are doing to New England right now?
 

3 touchdowns in 3 minutes..and 33 seconds...

Dayuuuuummmmmm  
 
 
A group hug for Cowher..is he the daddy or what?
 
 
Come tomorrow, Roethlisberger will have passed Brady as the golden child...The media will forget 2 Super Bowl MVPs and focus on a bad game in week 8.
 
 
nah...Ben ain't gonna make it through this season...he'll be on IR
 
 
Damn, I'm at 5-3 after the early games. Looks like I''ll be eating virtual macaroni and cheese (sans cheese) next week in order to pay off this virtual bet, unless things go better in the late games.
 
 
 
nah...Ben ain't gonna make it through this season...he'll be on IR
 

Yeah, he's got a body that can't hold up...Sorry, but I can't agreee with you on that one.
 
 
That's OK...we all got opinions...good kid though.

I'm watching him scramble...thinking he might get hurt one of these days...
 
 
Yeah, I was watching Denver and Atlanta earlier thinking the same thing. It wasn't so much the scrambles, but Vick likes to avoid sacks by running straight back. Eventually he just chucks the ball into the air, but he gets nailed a lot on those plays.
 
 
Dammit, I'm out of the running. I picked the loser on all the late games, except for the most important one. I'm out a hundred virtual bucks, but I'm happy!

STEELERS! STEELERS! STEELERS!
 
 
you got me on that pick Kick...I'm throwin in the terrible towel
 
 
I need 2 Brandon Lloyd TDs to win this week....
 
 
I haven't been participating. Just want to say it fills my heart with joy to see the Steelers and Texuns win today. Sadly, the Cowboys did too.

Watchin the bears game was a good introduction to the term "home field advantage"

Bad, bad calls.
 

Not only were they bad calls, but they were bad calls on challenges!!! How can you blow the call when you have it on video in front of you!!! I am so excited about the draft, Aaron Rogers? Mike Williams? Cedrick Benson? It will be great.
 
 
Panz, what's with the black box avatar? Is that some kind of political statement?
 
 
By the way, 5 New York Jet Defense fantasy points tonight get me a win!
 
 
Surely you don't still hold out hope for this pool Child?

Yeah, it's political alright. Timbers last thread really put me in a black mood.
 
 
BTW Kicky, I was gonna hire Gus to collect my dough...didn't see you around and all that...you know...a baseball bat in one of those sensitive places...
 
 
I am usually better with my upset picks....This week I picked every possible dog that lost.
 
 
 
BTW Kicky, I was gonna hire Gus to collect my dough...didn't see you around and all that...you know...a baseball bat in one of those sensitive places...
 

Okay, okay, I'll send you a virtual check. $600.00?
 
 
I was astounded by Minnesota, Denver and NE...I still don't understand what happened?

OK, I thought Coughlin was gonna lose the players...they seem to be thriving.

Vick?...how can you bet with his performances?

The Colts...any semblence of defense is gone.

Big Ben...has arrived.
 
 
 
Yeah, it's political alright. Timbers last thread really put me in a black mood.
 

You know, it's actually kind of cool, in it's own way.
 
 
Expound Kickster...
 
 
I don't know, it's like a minimalist kind of thing...all that negative space...deep and profound, yet bold, serious, and strident...I dig it.
 
 
Damn. Kick...you're so....so.....deep!
 
 
 
I don't know, it's like a minimalist kind of thing...all that negative space...deep and profound, yet bold, serious, and strident...
 

Yeah - that's what  Malevich  thought.

This is my favorite Kasimir work, and was the inspiration for my avatar.

i'm sure its happened before, but i'd never seen a game where 2 running backs on the same team rushed for over 100 yards.

curtis martin & lamont jordan each had 115 for the jets  last night... 
 
 
I felt so sorry for Fiedler and the defense...did you see how OVER Seau's career is?
 
 
i hope ricky's happy soaking up the sun & smoking the ganja while his former team flounders...
 
 
I think it's not Wannstedt's fault they're so bad...but if attendance goes down...he'll be coaching Pop Warner by December.
 
 
Wannstedt has underachieved his entire coaching career. Remember last year? They were suppose to contend with Ricky, and they didn't even make the playoffs.
 
 
So, kicky, which A2Ker won? Are you going to do it again for this weekend's games?
 
 
Who cares who won...it's history.. :wink:
 
 
I won.
 
 
Panzade won, didn't he? I don't have the patience to go back and check.
 
 
What kind of pool you running Kick?...serve yourself?
 
 
I can't believe it, but the winner is...

GUS! He picked 11 games!

The rest of it shook out like this:

Panz: 10--In case you're kicking yourself for picking New England, Gus came closer on Monday night's score, so you still wouldn't have taken him.

Fbaezer: 9

Me: 8 -- do I get anything for picking the exact total on monday night?

realjohnboy--8

Willow: 7

Child--6

So congratulations to the swami of the week--GUS!!! Here's your seven hundred virtual bucks buddy. What are you going to do with your winnings?
 
 
Recount, I had to of won.
 
 
Yeah, right...  
 
 
Way to go Gus!
 
 
I'm going to take my 700 dollars and buy Child of the Light a brain.

6 right! Poor guy.
 
 
"I'll take every home team."

The strategy of a genius.
 
 
Rule 2a-Winner cannot repeat.
 
 
 
I'm going to take my 700 dollars and buy Child of the Light a brain.

6 right! Poor guy.
 

Next week man, I am starting the research now...
 
 
been meaning to ask -- what the hail duz that   sig line mean?
 
 
It is a skat line that I love....Jack Black does it and it is great.
 
 
aah, I wondered that too, Child. I think I remember hearing him do that somewhere. Tenacious D, baby!
 
 
for some reason when i read the post my brain processed it as frank black...
 
 
I am not black like Barry White, but white like Frank Black is...

Kicky, good to see another D fan.
 
 
did u know:
jimmy pop of the bloodhound gang was once an intern for howard stern?
 
 
Not surprised. They are such an awesome band, just the names of some of their songs make me happy. I Wish I Were Queer So I Could Get Chicks, Another Dick With No Balls, Ballad Of Chasey Lain...Chasey Lain of course being the porn star.
 
 
"Just the names of some of their songs make me happy. I Wish I Were Queer So I Could Get Chicks, Another Dick With No Balls, Ballad Of Chasey Lain...Chasey Lain of course being the porn star."

When johnboy was 15 he was in a band. We were bad musicians, wrote terrible lyrics but, god, we could come up with great song-titles.
 
 
Hit me with some of the titles 3rd personer.
 
 
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you commissioner Tagliabue.

(APPLAUSE)

NFL colleagues, representatives of the NFLPA, esteemed front office owners, distinguished players and stinking cave-dwelling media hacks: It is time to consider the state of the union. We gather today to talk of the indecisive days of first-half parity, and the critical moments that lie ahead.

(APPLAUSE)

Thank you.

First let us begin with the promise offered in the NFL's first eight weeks.

In the realm of individual talents, nothing loomed larger than the growth of our young quarterbacks. Finally, it appears a group has arrived to fill the void created in the previous decade by the departures of Joe Montana, Dan Marino and John Elway. On one hand, we have a promising core of young veterans entering their prime. Among them are Donovan McNabb in Philadelphia, Daunte Culpepper in Minnesota, Peyton Manning in Indianapolis, Tom Brady in New England and Chad Pennington in New York.

But it is the budding skills of the second wave that makes the NFL's current crop special. Indeed, we might be looking at the best group of 20-something quarterbacks in league history. Players like Houston's David Carr and Detroit's Joey Harrington have arrived right on schedule, showcasing maturing talents in their third seasons. Michael Vick is Michael Vick. If you are really into faith, then perhaps you would throw San Diego's Drew Brees into this group as well.

And of course, we have discovered Pittsburgh's Ben Roethlisberger and Jacksonville's Byron Leftwich, who are showing us an uncommon flair for leadership. Roethlisberger has offered a rookie poise not seen since Marino's first season with the Dolphins, and Leftwich's fourth-quarter drives have been almost Elway-esque.

The first half of this season has proven one thing: The NFL is truly resting on a groundswell of gifted young arms. Brett Favre can retire in peace. Maybe he could even take Kerry Collins and Mark Brunell with him.

(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)

Where it concerns the strength of our teams, little has changed.

We have been defined by one buzzword in recent years, that being "parity." Once again we are seeing the full effects. While the New England Patriots have remained the droning monotone measure of success, injuries have decimated last season's other Super Bowl participant, the Carolina Panthers. Yet there needn't be despair. Of the league's 32 teams, 21 enter the second half of the season jockeying for 12 playoff spots.

In what has become custom for the league, many of last season's pitiful huddled masses have risen up. While Atlanta finished in last place in the NFC South in 2003, the Falcons now sit atop the division. San Diego rested at the bottom of the AFC West last season, but now shares a 5-3 record with the first-place Denver Broncos.

But to see the full scope, consider this wondrous transformation: Pittsburgh, Houston, Jacksonville, Detroit and both of the New York franchises combined to win an atrocious 32 pecent of their games in 2003. Midway through this season, that same group has won 70 percent of its games.

This means one thing: Our product is ever-changing, refreshing hopes on an annual basis. Annual regeneration is the lifeblood and No. 1 selling point of our league.

That, and Terrell Owens end-zone dances.

You go boy.

(APPLAUSE)

Now, we have seen our first-half successes and failures.

On the bright side, we've had some pleasant surprises to offset the doom and gloom. How about Brees and Antonio Gates in San Diego? Or Kurt Warner, Tiki Barber and Tom Coughlin in New York? And here's a shocker for the books &nash; who would have thought Tennessee's Billy Volek and San Francisco's Ken Dorsey would get more starts by midseason than the Giants' Eli Manning and the Chargers' Philip Rivers?

On other fronts, we still have our share of ego-maniacal players. But please, just let it go. It's part of the league now. Though I have to admit, hearing Keyshawn Johnson threaten to spank someone is ironic, as is Chad Johnson sending Pepto Bismol to opponents. Then again, maybe Johnson was just trying to give away leftovers from the Sam Wyche era.

Moving on, you have all heard that injuries to star players are up, but we have to merely consider it a bump in the road. The overall injuries aren't rising. However, the fear-mongering press coverage of them certainly is.

Per other concerns, our franchises in Miami and San Francisco are a complete mess. But we're quite certain owner Wayne Huizenga will get it figured out with the Dolphins. On that note, advance condolences to coach Dave Wannstedt. Same for Jim Haslett in New Orleans. As for the 49ers and Dennis Erickson  well, whatever.

Meanwhile, Mike Tice's coaching ability seems to be tied to the elasticity of Randy Moss's hamstring. Go figure. In other quarters, things haven't really worked out for Joe Gibbs in Washington. But give Gibbs a one-year mulligan. Not everyone can be Bill Parcells, you know. Speaking of Parcells, we were a little disappointed to see Dallas take a step back. Cincinnati, too. Kind of makes you wonder about coaches who stake their reputations on one side of the football.

Marvin Lewis hasn't done squat for that Bengals defense. Chalk up Tony Dungy in that category, too, for his work in Indianapolis. And Jon Gruden, boy, all it took for him to find Brian Griese in Tampa was having no other alternative.

And since we're talking about Gruden, anyone wonder about his choice of Charlie Garner over Thomas Jones? Nice call. Those comparisons between Gruden and horror-movie icon Chucky are fitting.

He can massacre a roster with the best of them.

(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)

But have no doubts. Even with deficiencies, our league is strong.

It is a sobering time for many other professional sports leagues. The NBA saw a record number of high-school entrants and draft choices this year, while continuing its trend of giving skyrocketing contracts to marginal stars. And Major League Baseball, well, Barry Bonds isn't even in our league, but we're issuing him a suspension anyway. Thank goodness for those Boston Red Sox. Seize the moment, Bud Selig. As for the NHL, they are in a lockout and threatening to cancel their season. I'm guessing that means it was supposed to have started by now.

As for our league, we have enjoyed relative labor peace for over two decades, longest amongst all professional sports. To date, our television distribution rights remain the most highly sought and lucrative contract in all the land. And while we have been criticized for managing our game with an iron fist, our stance has kept the NFL healthy.

After initial difficulties, our teams are now managing their salary caps better than ever before. We also have the strongest substance abuse policies and detection methods in pro sports. And when everyone said it couldn't be done, we crushed Maurice Clarett's attempt to thwart our age restrictions in the draft.

Oh, and let's not forget our beer commercials. They are dead on.

I do love twins.

(APPLAUSE, APPLAUSE, APPLAUSE)

Finally, I would be remiss for not mentioning Ricky Williams. We've been through some tough times with you. And for the last time, no, you won't be back in uniform this season. However, I would just like to concede that it would be nice to see you back in 2005.

The NFL is a more colorful place with you in it. Yes, I'll admit it, I'm happy to hear that you're looking for reinstatement. Just stay vigilant and keep filing papers.

Rather than rolling them, that is.

(Awww, so close. We tried. Really, we did.)
 
 
Usually I don't read post that are long, but I actually read that...

That was nice, good job.
 
 
I copied it...for your amusement.
I could never have the patience to write that many words.
 
 
Oh...I have been tricked.
 
 
Good Evening, and welcome to a thread where people who don't know squat about NFL predict what the outcomes of this weekend's games will be and then talk about things totally unrelated. Makes sense, right?
Early games on Sunday: AZ (2-5) at Miami (1-7); Phil (7-0) at Ptittsburg (6-1) (BEST GAME OF THE DAY); KC (3-4) at Tampa Bay (2-5); Oakland (2-6) at Carolina (1-6); NY Jets (6-1) at Buff (2-5); Dallas (3-4) at Cincy (2-5) and Wash (2-5) at Detroit (4-3)
Late games: New Orleans (3-4) at San Diego (5-3); Seattle (4-3) at SF (1-6); Chicago ((2-5) @ NY Giants (5-2); Houston (4-3) at Denver (5-3);
New Eng (6-1) at St Louis (4-5).
Late Sun night game: Cleveland (3-4) at Balt (4-3).
Monday Night: Minn (5-2) at Indy (4-3).
The tiebreaker is the total number of points scored in the game between Houston and Denver. Predict that total.
 
 
Child, johnboy tells me that the titles of his songs are a bit inappropriate for posting on A2K. Johnboy was, after all, fifteen and quite eager to shock people. Were any of yall in a band when you were 15? What were you into when you were 15? Can you remember being 15?
 
 
Songs about poonani and boobs I'd guess. But it has been far too long for me to remember age 15.
 
 
Fighting Denny Greens win the battle of the bad(if you can't tell I am a huge Denny Green fan.)
Roethlisberger continues to win with a 3 touchdown game.
Priest gives me yet another fantasy boost and KC wins.
Carolina wins, I guess?
Jets beat Buffalo with a big Defensive effort.
Cincy wins with The Dallas Secondary begging for the Pepto.
Detroit defends their home field with an easy win.
San Diego beats the soon to be Haslettless Saints.
UPSET SPECIAL!! San Fran beats Seattle, Kevan Barlow's coming out party!
In a battle of old NFL teams, The New York football Giants beat the Chicago Bears.
Houston takes Denver down yet another peg and Carr officially arrives.
Defending Champs or not, without Ty Law the Pats are behind bars...Big game for Rams receivers and Bulger.
Baltimore wins a VERY ugly game.
The Mossless Vikes go down relatively easily.

64 points in the Houston Denver game.

Hope you like my Swaming Panzade.
 
 
I love it Child...you have a gift
 
 
When I was 15 I bought a 1963 Fender Jazz Bass and started playing with a neighborhood garage band. The Big tunes were: Dirty Water,You Really Got Me and G_L_O_R_I_A GLORIIIIAA!
 
 
I played guitar when I was 15. If you know who Pantera and Black Label Society are, you have an idea of what I play. I also played acoustic Zakk Wylde and Tenacious D. A gloriously eclectic mix
 
 
Do you, child and pan, still play your guitars. I really, really stank at playing the emerging genre of music when I was 15: rock and roll. But I was a good percussionist on tympany, learning to love "real" music.
But then I got into running cross-country and acting and of course, girls, and music making got set aside, got dusty and probably won't be back until I'm in a nursing home during "activity time."
I'm amazed at how many of my young (20-something) employees play some sort of instrument (one is almost making a living at it; his band has probably been in your city)
poonani? um...maybe I shouldn't ask.
 
 
I've played music all my life and played professionally for 25 years. I can justifiably say that it has made my life rather difficult at times. I don't play much guitar on stage anymore(every solo is a blindfolded adventure) but I love to take a shot at it.
 
 
I still play guitar, rather well too.
 
 
Playing music professionally has made your life more difficult? Please explain. Are you just talking about the money or lack thereof?
Acoustic or electric, pan and child?
The employee of mine who is almost making a living at it is the singer in a Goth band (although he now uses another label for his genre of music which I can't remember). Anyway, his singing (I'm told since I don't stay awake late enough to ever catch his band's local shows) is pretty loud and frenetic. Oddly, his voice teacher uses opera as the device to get him to sing without hurting himself. He doesn't like opera, could never sit through one but knows a hell of a lot about opera. Probably the only pink or green or purple mohawk-haired guy in America to know about opera.
Still waiting for a definition of POONANI.
 
 
I prefer acoustic over electric, but either will suffice.

Definition of Poonani? Ya know, snatch, poon, poontang, snapper, lipper, vage, pus, pussy, wet stuff, pink, downtown...Ya know?
 
 
Ya Know, I didn't but, golly gee. I sure do know now (blushing deeply).
 
 
I started out playing bluegrass in C'Ville back in the 70's as we talked about earlier...the old Mousetrap.In the 80's I was in a Beach Boys tribute band and when country got real popular I went to that. Music has caused a lot of upheaval in my life..it's a tough business.
 
 
I used to want to become a musician, because of the poonani and stuff...But it seems like a lot of hard work.
 
 
 
I used to want to become a musician, because of the poonani and stuff...But it seems like a lot of hard work.
 

Yo queria hacerme un musician a causa de la poonani.

How's that spanish panzade?
 
 
Bien, hijo. Pero tenemos que practicar unas cositas.
 
 
 
Bien, hijo. Pero tenemos que practicar unas cositas.
 

Yo se.
 
 
LAST CALL. Back to NFL football predictions. A2Kers seem to not have a great deal of interest in sports but if anyone does they should go back to page 12 and make their educated guesses. Don't know anything about football? Don't worry, make your picks anyway and win 100 virtual bucks.
We won't laugh at your choices, since we don't know anything either. The deadline is right before gametimes on Sunday.
 
 
rjb, Kicky's shill...see ya at noon
 
 
 
We won't laugh at your choices, since we don't know anything either.
 

Uhh, I don't echo that sentiment. I think I know a lot about football and football prognosticating.
 
 
Indeed you do, Child. So much so that I have no clue what your choices were. Please clarify.
I'm going with Miami, Pitts, KC, Car, da Jets, Cin, Det, San De, Seattle, da Giants, Denver, NE, Balt and Indy with 41 points in the Hou/Dev game.
 
 
 
Fighting Denny Greens win the battle of the bad(if you can't tell I am a huge Denny Green fan.)
Roethlisberger continues to win with a 3 touchdown game.
Priest gives me yet another fantasy boost and KC wins.
Carolina wins, I guess?
Jets beat Buffalo with a big Defensive effort.
Cincy wins with The Dallas Secondary begging for the Pepto.
Detroit defends their home field with an easy win.
San Diego beats the soon to be Haslettless Saints.
UPSET SPECIAL!! San Fran beats Seattle, Kevan Barlow's coming out party!
In a battle of old NFL teams, The New York football Giants beat the Chicago Bears.
Houston takes Denver down yet another peg and Carr officially arrives.
Defending Champs or not, without Ty Law the Pats are behind bars...Big game for Rams receivers and Bulger.
Baltimore wins a VERY ugly game.
The Mossless Vikes go down relatively easily.

64 points in the Houston Denver game.

 
 
 
NY Jets at Buffalo- NYJ

Dallas at Cincinnati - DAL

A la lucha!
 
 
10 more minutes if anyone else wants to play.
 
 
  Still first quarter.......but OMG. Steelers are handing the Eagles their ass on a platter   21 - 0
 
 
The early set of games (seven of them) is over and here is how our pretty pathetic prognositicators are doing:
johnboy (2 right-5 wrong); child (3-4), fbez (3-4) and then there is pan.
Better luck later on.
 
 
Pan throws in the towel. Not one of my good days
 
 
johnboy picks up pan's towel. Never know when you might need a towel.
Damn, it's a Martha Stewart Signature towel. Is that the one you meant to toss in?
Are we doing any better in the second games? I haven't been watching?
 
 
No, I meant to toss the Phil Simms autographed towel...what a dork he is...
 
 
Simms probably should retire.
Through the afternoon games, johnboy and fbez are at 6-6; child is at 4-8 and pan is at 3-9. Tie-breaking score was 44 points (johnboy had 41; fbez had 42) but that is of no consequence. We all have Balt tonight and then, Monday night I have Indy and fbez has MN. Start converting your virtual pesos into virtual dollars; Indy in a romp.
 
 
...a bad referee call, a dumb defensive play...  
 
 
so, hijo...did ya win?
 
 
Not exactly an Indy romp judging from the final score. I forgot to watch the game on Monday night. I'm going to post another round for this weekend's games but we've got to figure out a way to get more people involved. I reckon that serious A2K sports junkies hang out elsewhere leaving the rest of us here.
 
 
Hey, you can lead a horse to water....I enjoy it and I appreciate your effort even if the turn-out is sparse.
 
 
Hey, realjohnboy, you stole my thread! What the hell is up with that?! That's it, put up your dukes, pal!

[size=8](actually, I'm happy you took the initiative--it was a pain keeping track of all those games for everybody)[/size]
 
 
Calm down Kicky, while you were off chasing skirt we had to put your house in order.
 
 
Phew! Thank god you were here to hold me back, Panzade. There could have been some bloodshed. I'm calm now. Carry on.
 
 
Did Not Steal Your Damn Thread, Kicky. You left it lying there like a pile of wet socks and jockstraps. Someone had to, um, pick up after you.
Glad to see you back. Please post the games for this weekend.
Thanks. johnboy.
 
 
In my defense, I was kicked off A2K for those few days. Anyway, thanks for keeping it going.

Kicked off were you, Kicky? I've run into several old A2Kers who have been made to go take a time-out and stand in the corner. Are we getting old and crotchety; is A2K becoming more diverse (ie less liberal); or is the A2K staff becoming very sensitive about real or perceived insults?

I'm going with Baltimer, Tennessee, Jacksonville, Indy, Norleans, Pittsburg (go, Steelers), Seattle, Atlanta, Washington, San Fran (game between two really bad teams), Green Bay, the Giants, New England, and Philly (43 points).

St. Louis takes the Hawks down with a last second field goal.
Tampa wins with a huge game from Griese.
Washington wins, watch out for Ramsey in this game.
San Fran wins...they always win.
Green Bay wins, Viking fans begin to sweat..

Philly wins, 34 points.

The Swam is out, until next week.

Buffalo at New England, 8:30 p.m.--New England

Monday, Nov. 15

Philadelphia at Dallas, 9:00 p.m.--Philadelphia

Total points: 44
 
 
Cleveland over Pittsburg, Gus? Are you insane? Um, never mind answering that.
We have incredible divergence of opinion, particularly on the early games, and we've yet to hear from pan and our revered leader, kicky.

Anyone else who wants to play is invited to do so. You don't have to know anything about the NFL I don't and I won last weekend!
 
 
I'm still shakin my head over Gus's picks. Either he's gone loony or he's onto something. See y'all around noon.
 
 
Jets
Tennessee
Detroit
Houston (praying)
KC(offering first born child)

willow: you seem to have left out Detroit vs Jacksonville.
 
 
out of the pan, pan, and into the fire. It's game-time.
 
 
OOPS!, didn't get the picks in in time....maybe next week.

ITM...go willow...spank these boys!
 
 
As far as I'm concerned, pan, you can post you choices still. We trust you to tell us what you would have chosen prior to kick-off.
 
 
Thanks rjb but I'm a stickler for the 1pm deadline.
 
 
I think I have the negative psychic stuff happening...I'm usually not this bad in picks...maybe things will turn around in the second half.
 
 
Point well-taken, pan. Rules are rules. I have no idea how the early games are turning out. I've been out raking leaves and when I come in to take a break I'm hearing old time country music out of an NPR station from Roanoke. The two hosts have an incredible collection of stuff from the 1940-1980 period. Real country music. REAL.
 
 
Nothin like a little Ol' Time music for leaf raking...
 
 
Indeed, pan. For a long time I was in denial about being a Virginian or a southerner. I was born in Wisconsin, don't you know. I was sophisticated and went to the College of William and Mary. I graduated and left Virginia: Vietnam and then London and Capetown and many places in between but now I'm raking leaves and happily listening to real country/bluegrass music.
Yes, you can go home again.
How's that for a digression in the spirit of this thread? -rjb-
 
 
So after the early games I'm at 6-2. and fbaez is at 7-1. We all guessed wrong on TN vs CHI. How are the rest of yall doing? Go Skins!
 
 
ahhh...my forlorn Skins
 
 
I'm 5-3. And those stupid redskins are looking like loss number 4 for me.
 
 
2-5 against the spread...Skins aren't a good pick.
 
 
0-3 so far in OT games...That hurts.
 
 
I didn't realize how inept the deadskins had become. Good luck, Mr Gibbs.
Congrats, fbaezer, on your victory this weekend. We're coming after you next week.

Congrats, fbaezer, on your victory this weekend. We're coming after you next week.
 

I do believe there is one team even worse off. 49ers THEY SUUUCK!

Top five pick in the draft..QB? O-Line Man? D Line Man? Corner Back? Receiver? They need it all.
 
 
Why don't you guys jump on the Steelers bandwagon? They are the best f*cking team in the league right now!!! Yahoooeey!!!

By the way, fbaezer won? How could that be with two games left to go?
 
 
11 David Akers points tonight get me a fantasy win.
 
 
Guys, that would be 6870 virtual pesos, please  .
 
 
bien hecho fb
 
 
Congrats. How many games did you win, fbaezer?
 
 
Gracias, panza.

11/14, kicky. Not bad, eh?
 
 
No, infatti, eccellente! Bravissimo!
 
 
How about this weekend's games, kicky?
 
 
I'm too lazy for this thread. Feel free to take it over if you want, realjohnboy.
 
 
damn, kicky, I hope you're not pouting. You started this thread and as far as I'm concerned, it belongs to you. But it does take some effort to keep up with.
Here is this weekend's schedule of pretty mediocre games, with an added bit of info to confuse you: the streaks:
So, for example, in the first game between Detroit & Minnesota, you will see:
Det (L3) 4-5 @ MN (L3 ) 5-4. That means that Detroit has lost its last three games, currently has four wins and five losses and is playing this week at Minnesota, which has lost its last 3 games but has 5 wins and 4 losses. Here we go:

Det (L3) 4-5 @ MN (L3) 5-4
Denver (W1) 6-3 @ NO (W1) 4-5
SF (L4) 1-8 @ Tampa Bay(L1) 3-6
AZ (W2) 4-5 @ Car (W1) 2-7
TN (L1) 3-6 @ JAX (W1) 6-3
Dal (L2) 3-6 @ Balt (W2) 6-3
St Louis (W1) 5-4 @ Buff (L1) 3-6
Indy (W2) 6-3 @ Chicago (W3) 4-5 (one of the better games)
Pitts (W7) 8-1 @ Cin (W2) 4-5
Jets (L2) 6-3 @ Cleve (L3) 3-6

San Diego (W3) 6-3 @ Oak (L1) 3-6
Miami (L2) 1-8 @ Seattle (L1) 5-4
Atl (W2) 7-2 @ NY Giants (L2) 5-1 (another good one, perhaps)
Wash (L1) 3-6 @ Phil (W1) 8-1

GreenBay (W4) 5-4 @ Hous (L2) 4-5
New Eng (W2) 8-1 @ KC (L2) 3-6

Please choose the winners and, as the tiebreaker, predict the total number of points that will be scored in the game between Atlanta and the New York Giants.

Thank you for playing and I decline to be responsible for any typo/clerical errors.

Selections need to be in by 1 pm on Sunday, Eastern Time.

Huh? I thought the Pats game was monday night. Oh well, whatever, yeah, I'll stick with 51.
 
 
The key games for us, kicky, are Pack/Houston and Pittsburgh/Cincinnatti. The rest are the same.
 
 
nfl
Thanks, willow, but you left out the TN @ JAX game. Please edit your list to include that game.

Kicky, you are probably right that the tiebreaker game (the one in which "bettors" predict the total number of points scored) is the Monday night game. I decided to choose some earlier game.
 
 
realjohnboy, I see. You are getting tricky, eh?  

Gus, I agonized over that Packers/Houston pick. Although I'd love to see the Packers lose every game from here on out, I think Houston's going down. But how could you pick against the Steelers!?
 
 
nfl
I'm exhausted! I may have to take a nap. But 7 stalwart players this week. That is great.
I chose the Atl/Giants game to be the tiebreaker because I felt that there wouldn't be a lot of disagreement about the Sunday night and Monday night games. If that was the case, we could crown a winner here by around 7 pm on Sunday. As it turned out, willow and gus have gone against the conventional wisdom so we'll have to see how that plays out.

I designed a matrix that is amusing:
johnboy and kicky disagree on one game.
pan and kicky disagree on one game
pan and johnboy disagree on two games.

johnboy and fbaez disagree on five games.
fbaez and child disagree on five games.
johnboy and child disagree on two games.
 
 
nfl early games
So here is where I think we are after the early games:
Child is lighting the way @ 9-1, missing only the Car/Az one. Well done, Child.
Pan and johnboy are @ 8-2; kicky is @ 7-3; willow (who left out a game) is @ 7-2 and gus and fbaez are @ 6-4.
Go Falcons, in a low-scoring game.
 
 
I'm so glad you decided to take this thread over, realjohnboy. You are much more dedicated than I was.
 
 
nfl
As of the close of business after the Sunday night game...johnboy, pan and child are at 13-2. Kicky is next with 12-3 All four of those players pick NE over KC tonight so the first three will remain in a tie and kicky will be one game behind regardless of the outcome. Willow is at 11-3 (having left out a game) and is picking KC. Even if that happens, however, willow could not catch up. Gus and fab man didn't do badly (10-5) but not good enough in a week that saw a number of games being closer than I certainly expected.
So this week's round is over unless we want to engage in the now customary end of the game fist-fights that seem to be the rage in athletics. The Falcons-Giants game was the tiebreaker, with 24 points being scored. Child predicted 64(!), Pan 36 and johnboy 30.
I reckon the games for this week start on Thanksgiving. Anyone interested in playing, given the holiday, or should we take the week off?
Thanks for participating! -johnboy
 
 
Damn J-Boy, give you the reins and you eke it out...Congrats, I fought you tooth and nail.

Deadline should be Thursday at 1:00 pm
 
 
nfl
Thanks, pan...I'll be asleep long before tonight's game is over. Here are the choices for the games starting on Thursday:

Indy (7-3) (with a streak of winning their last three:W3) @ Det (4-6) (with a streak of losing their last four: L4)
Chicago (4-6) (L1) @ Dallas (3-7) (L3)

Cleveland (3-7) (L4) @ Cincy (4-6) (L1)
San Diego (7-3) (W4) @ KC (3-7) (L3) *
JAX (6-4) (L1) @ MN (6-4) (W1) (s/b great game)
Phil (9-1) (W2) @ NY Giants (5-5) (L3)
Wash (3-7) (L2) @ Pitts (9-1) (W8)
Tampa Bay (4-6) (W1) @ Car (3-7) (W2)
TN (4-6) (W1) @ Hous (4-6) (L3)

NO (4-6) (L1) @ Atl (8-2) (W3)
Miami (1-9) (L3) @ SF (1-9) (L5) (someone will win, I guess)
Buff (4-6) (W1) @ Seattle (6-4) (W1)
NY Jets (7-3) (W1) @ AZ (4-6) (L1)
Balt (7-3) (W3) @ NE (9-1) (W3) * (best game, probably)
Oak (3-7) (L1) @ Denver (7-3) (W2)

St Louis (5-5) (L1) @ Green Bay (6-4) (W5) How great is Favre?

The * is based on my projection of NE beating KC tonight. I'll edit if I turn out to be wrong.

Let's use the Jacksonville-Minnesota game as the tiebreaker. Predict the total number of points in that game.

Pan says the deadline should be Thursday at around noon. Thanks for playing.. -johnboy-
 
 
I think I might get in on this, although I'll be visiting the family this weekend, so I might not have access to a computer after wednesday.
 
 
The question at this point in the season is: Can the Pats figure out how to beat the Steelers for the AFL championship. They looked like a road paver on cruise control last night.

Thanks fbaeze and willow for picking. Alas, willow, you are again one card short of a full deck. You left out Philly @ the Giants. I'm not going to nag this week, so pan and kicky and child and gus: you're on your own to remember to play, with the deadline being whatever time kick-off is on Thursday.
I see NE beat KC Monday night ("road paver on cruise control" = great metaphor). So the three winning pickers went 14-2 for the week. That's going to be tough to beat.
I hope y'all have a good holiday weekend. And, for you, fbaeze in Mexico, just a nice regular weekend. I'll check back on Sunday. -rjb-

Oh, yeah: my picks are:
Indy, Dallas, Cincy, San Diego, Minn, Philly, Pitts, Car, TN, Atlanta,

Thanks, pan. I didn't mean to piss you off with yet another nagging/taunting pm. Once I finish this nfl weekend and my stint as the dasher on Balderdash, I promise to try to go away for awhile.

johnboy

(ps: speaking of Balderdash, please remember to cast your vo--oops, sorry, enjoy your afternoon).
 
 
Well, let's take a look at where we stand after this weekend of eating turkey and going cold-turkey on A2K. As of the end of the night on Sunday, johnboy, fabman and child were at 11-4 and willow was at 10-5 (keep choosing KC, willow). We've all got Green Bay tonight so the standings will not change regardless of the outcome.
The tie-breaker was Jax-MN in which the total number of points scored was 43. Let's see: child predicted 68; fbae 48 and johnboy, hmm, 42.
 
 
hmmm
 
 
Week 13 Dec 5/6
Do you want to try again or are you tired of writing checks to johnboy? I do take credit cards. (We're talking virtual money here, of course. None of us, except gus, actually have any money).

This Sunday, we have:

Buff (5-6) (W2) @ Miami (2-9) (W1)
Car (4-7) (W3) @ NO (4-7) (L2)
Hous (5-6) (W1) @ Jets (8-3) (W2)
Atl (9-2) (W4) @ TBay (4-7) (L1)
Cin (5-6) (W1) @ Balt (7-4) (L1)
MN (7-4) (W2) @ Chi (4-7) (L2)
NE (10-1) (W4) @ Clev (3-8) (L5)
AZ (4-7) (L2) @ Det (4-7) (L5)
TN (4-7) (L1) @ Indy (8-3) (W4)

Pitts (10-1) (W9) @ Jax (6-5) (L2)

And Monday:
Dal (4-7) (W1) @ Seattle (6-5) ((L1)

That's 16 games. Please predict all of them and include a projection of the total number of points scored in the game twixt Denver and San Diego.
New players are, of course, welcome. The deadline is kick-off on Sunday afternoon (1 pm).
Thanks -rjb-

St Louis, Buffalo, Carolina, Jets, Atlanta, Baltimore, Minnesota, New England, Arizona, Indianapolis, Oakland (I came close to choosing KC, willow, really), San Diego (with 51 total points), Washington, Philadelphia (with a great deal of reluctance), Pittsburgh and Seattle.
Is that all 16? Yep, I think I got them all. Good luck in your pickings! -rjb-
 
 
That was really fast, fbaezer. I thought I would post the schedule and then quickly follow up with my picks so yall wouldn't think I was coat-tailing.
But you beat me in with you picks, except you didn't select a winner in the Monday night game.
Please edit your post accordingly.
"...I'm at a frog's hair of winning." You live in Mexico, right? But that expression (never heard by me before) sounds like Lousiana. rjb
 
 
oops: Seattle, of course.
 
 
This week's games are on the previous page. Come on, pan, child, kicky, willow and gus. Time to try to get it right.
Anyone else interested is welcome to join... by kickoff time on Sunday.

Ever since the total point tiebreaker was moved from Monday night I've been getting skewered. I'm a creature of habit. I request a resumption of MNF tie-breaker.
 
 
Too late to make any change this week, Pan. in the choice of tiebreaker. No time for pouting. Please make your picks. If you come close to needing the tiebreaker this week to win, I'll consider your request next week.
(Did you notice today that Va Tech beat up that little school down on one of your Florida beaches? I'm not a Hokie fan but that was pretty cool).

Buffalo
N.O.
Jets
Atlanta

Yeah, Tech was far superior...I mean the 'Canes are struggling with a Gator quarterback. I'm looking forward to seeing Tech at the Sugar Bowl.
 
 
An hour until the start of today's games. We're needing picks by pan, gus and child from amongst previous players. Wecome to PDiddie for joing us this week. Anyone else want to play? Hurry.
Good luck to everyone. I'll try to give yall an update after the early games end around 4 pm ET.

Too late to make any change this week, Pan. in the choice of tiebreaker. No time for pouting.
 

You get points for the sensitive side, RJB.
 
 
Good afternoon. The early games are probably pretty much over. I wouldn't know. I was told that I had no excuse, no excuse at all, to avoid raking leaves.
So I have no idea how the ten early games have or will end up. This is (to my mind) amusing though. I did a little matrix thing and discovered that, for example, pan differed from the other five players by a factor of 2.4 while at the other extreme, kicky came in at 4.0 from the other players. I think that means that kicky is out of step with the rest of us on this week's picks.
And oh yes, pan: all six of us have selected Pitt in tonight's game and Seattle on Monday night. That means that (because the Den-SD game is the tiebreaker) we can crown this week's winner late this afternoon! We can finish cooking this puppy before suppertime.
 
 
I've got pan and kicky @ 7-3 with willow and rjb @ 6-4. Fbaez and Pdid are @ 5-5. Could be interesting in Wash and KC win.
 
 
Good opiates in C'ville
 
 
Akkk....another late afternoon swoon. Who woulda thunk the Redskins?
 
 
who wouda? realjohnboy chose the Skins. The contest here comes down to KC. If she/he finally gets it right, willow wins. Final results in a few minutes, I don't know nothing about opiates in Cville, pan.
 
 
I can officially declare that WILLOW is this week's winner. Willow, rjb, pan and kicky finished the afternoon games tied at 9-5 (Pdid was at 8-6 and fbaez had a bad day, ending at 6-8). We all have Pitts and Seattle so nothing will change.
There were 37 points scored in the Den-SD tiebreaker. Willow predicted 48, rjb 51, pan 53 and kicky 54.
Congratulations, willow. You finally made the KC thingee work.
Will I see yall again next week, week 14? I hope so. -rjb-
 
 
Shit! I knew I should have gone with my gut on that Giants game! I'll be back next week. I have to win one of these damn things!
 
 
Once again good work rjb.

My impressions of this week.
The NFC sucks. Green Bay was embarrassing. 4 teams 5-7 and still in the hunt.

I goofed on the Atlanta game because I forgot that TB plays Vick real tough.

Carolina and John Fox are amazing.

My Skins finally won.

Way to go Willow!
 
 
Point well taken, pan, re TBay & AtL. I showed my very colorful spread-sheet of our picks to one of my employees. Andy follows the NFL far more closely than I do. He immediately focused on that game, saying the Bucs know how to play the Falcons.
So we didn't appear to have a very good week as a group here on A2K. But when I was putting together the matchups for next week (using the ESPN site) I see that our A2K players who ended up at 10-6 were right in the middle compared to the experts who pick for ESPN.
Coming up in a moment: Week 14 for Dec 12/13.
I'm not trying to rush you by putting this up early. I'm in the retail business and things are a bit hectic.
Which is good. So far the holiday season is looking promising.
 
 
WEEK 14:
And as usual the format is...
Chicago (record of 5-7)(Streak of W1) @
Jacksonville (6-6)(L3)
NYGiants (5-7)(L5) @ Balt (7-5)(L2)
Indy (9-3)(W5) @ Houston (5-7)(L1)
Cleve (3-9)(L6) @ Buffalo (6-6)(W3)
New Orleans (4-8)(L3) @ Dallas (5-7)(W2)
Oakland (4-8)(L1) @ Atlanta (9-3)(L1)
Seattle (6-6)(L2) @ Minn (7-5)(L1)
Cincy (6-6)(W2) @ New Eng (11-1)(W5)
Those are the 8 early pm games
Six late pm games
NYJets (9-3)(W3) @ Pittsburgh (11-1)(W10)
Miami (2-10)(L1) @ Denver (7-5)(L2)
Detroit (5-7)(W1) @ Green Bay (7-5)(L1)
TBay (5-7)(W1) @ San Diego (9-3)(W6)
St Louis (6-6)(W1) @ Carolina (5-7)(W4)
San Fran (1-11 (L7) @ Arizona (4-8)(L3)
The Sunday night game features
Philly (11-1)(W4) @ Washington (4-8)(W1)
and Monday night we end with
Kansas City (4-8)(W1) @ Tenn (4-8)(L2)

As the tiebreaker we will indeed go with the Monday night game: KC @ TN

Please be sure you make a pick in each of the 16 games and predict the total number of points in the tiebreaker. The deadline is kick-off time on Sunday (about 1 pm ET).
New players are always welcome! -rjb
 
 
I like to try, as the moderator, to get my picks in as early as I can. An appearance of fairness issue.
Si I have Chicago, Baltimore, Indy, Buff, Dallas, Atlanta, Minnesota and New England.
Then I have Pitts, Denver, Green Bay, San Diego, Carolina and Arizona.
And in the after-my-bedtime games Philly and (are you ready for this, willow) KC with a total of 33 points scored in that game (on a cold and rainy night--or is it a domed stadium? No idea).
 
 
I think I'm going to try a new strategy this week. I'm going to wait and see what Panz picks, then I'm going to pick all the same games and pick one point less than him on the tiebreaker total.
 
 
LOL....the tiebreaker has really cost me Kicky.
 
 
Damn, now I'm under.500 in my fantasy football  
But anyways...

hmm...johnboy searches for his A2K NFL Pickers' Rulebook...and then realizes why he can't find it: it doesn't exist. Never has and never will.
I reckon that there would be no rule against someone editing his/her pick-list up until the 1 pm deadline. If the QB for my Steelers gets run over by a bus on Thursday, or if a blizzard moves into TN, I might want to change a prediction. I've got no problem with that. But right now I do this with a yellow highlighter and a red highlighter. If I have to go out and buy a green one and a blue one to keep up with changes...jeez, they're 99 cents each.!
Play your little mind games, kicky and pan, but don't make this too much more complicated for me than it is. I'm just a dumb red-neck from Virginia, after all. -johnboy

OOf! I took a hit right off the bat.
 
 
Oh my. After the early games, fbaezer was looking really strong @ 8-0, Kicky was @ 7-1 and pan was @ 6-2. Pdid and rjb were @ 5-3. Willow didn't play this week.
Through the late games, wow! Pan and kicky claw their way back to tie fbaez @ 11-3. It all comes down to Monday night. If TN wins, so does kicky.
If KC wins, it comes down to tiebreaker points:
44 for fbaez vs 45 for pan. At least that's the way I have it right now.
 
 
Good luck Kicky...you deserve one...especially cause you picked Tenn...
I'm hoping the switch to Monday night point totals will help me win my first.

In any case, last night's tough outing by the "Skins made me very proud and offered good omens for next year.
 
 
Damn it, I lost again! I'm always this close!

<holding index finger and thumb a millimeter apart>
 
 
Dude, you didn't lose...you wuz robbed.The ref crew was a disgrace. I hate it when they decide the game. That roughing the passer was a terrible call.
In my mind you won the whole enchilada....

Ummm...can I have my virtual loot now?
 
 
Good evening, all. Congratulations, panzade, for a very fine come-from-behind victory (MyOhMy#1): you were behind Fbaez and Kicky after the early games. Kicky, you were so, so close!
87 points in the KC-TN game (MyOhMy#2). The tv people love it but anyone who knows anything about football should be disgusted. It's absurd, it's obscene, the defensive coaches should be hung up by their (...calm down rjb, take the little green pill and then the pink one. Breathe deeply and try taking a nap). Okay, okay, but that ain't professional football at it's best.
(MyOhMy#3) is that the "experts" on ESPN (where I gather my schedules and records for this game) finished this week at 13-3, 12-4 and 11-5. We seem to be just as smart as they are.
I noticed (MyOhMy#4) that there are nfl games scheduled for this coming SATURDAY as well as Sunday and Monday. I will try to get the list posted here shortly so you can make your predictions before game time on Saturday. I'm in the retail business so I won't have time to nag but yall have gotten good at remembering to post. I hope Willow comes back. Thanks and good luck in Week 15. -johnboy-
 
 
I didn't actually see much of that game, Panz, but if you say they wuz robbed, that's good enough for me. Buy me a consolation beer with your winnings?

You are right, rjb. 87 points is the kind of crap you see in the Arena football league. I hate games like that. I remember one of the first games I ever really seriously watched as a kid was the Steelers/Rams in 1975 or 76. It was a monday night game, and the score was 3-3 until late in the 4th quarter, when the Rams finally punched in a TD from the 1-yard line in a grueling defensive battle. My team lost 10-3, but THAT was a real football game!

Bring back the Steel Curtain!!!
 
 
I agree Kicky...games used to draw me in...now I change channels and there's 14 more points on the board.

Trust me, the officials and the KC defense stunk.
About the only good thing for Tennesseee is that they found someone to replace what's-his-name in Volek.

BTW, I figured KC would give up 45 points alone
 
 
Felicidades Panzade!

This is the second time I lose on the points scored definition, and I always shoot too low.

I gotta remember: Monday football is for tv, Monday night football is for tv, Monday night football is for tv. Lotta points, lotta points, lotta points.
 
 
WEEK 15 is coming up starting on SATURDAY at about 1 pm. I'll be working so if any of yall don't see someone here who should be, harass them.
New players are always welcome.
The format is the same as usual--Visitor (W-L record)(Streak) @ Home Team (etc).

Saturday:
Pitts (12-1)(W11) @ NY Giants (5-8)(L6)
Wash (4-9)(L1) @ San Fran (2-11)(W1)
Car (6-7)(W5) @ Atlanta (10-3)(W1)
Sunday Early Games:
Houston (5-8)(L2) @ Chicago (5-8)(L1)
Buffalo (7-6)(W4) @ Cincy (6-7)(L1)
San Diego (10-3)(W7) @ Cleveland (3-10)(L7)

Tenn (4-9)(L3) @ Oakland (4-9)(L2)
Sunday Night:
Balt (8-5)(W1) @ Indy (10-3)(W6)
and Monday (and rjb grimaces-surely we can find a better game to be the tiebreaker but, sigh, this is it)
New England (12-1)(W6) @ Miami (2-11)(L2).

Did I mention that you must submit by about 1 pm ET on SATURDAY?
 
 
Sure....I just wanted to prove a point...I do well with Monday night tie-breakers...but pick any game rjb
 
 
No, I reckon we'll stick with the Monday night game.
The tiebreaker is about total number of points scored; not about who wins or loses a dreadfully boring game between NE and Miami.
Did I mention that the deadline is about 1 pm on SATURDAY?
 
 
Tough choices. So many mediocre teams. I'm going with:
Pitts, Wash and Carolina;
Chicago, Buffalo, San Diego, Minn, NYJets & Philly;
Kansas City, TBay, St Louis, Green Bay & Oakland;
Indy and then NE (with 37 total points). Is that all 16? I believe so.
SATURDAY 1 PM. Thanks, realjohnboy

RJB and I are diverging with Carolina and Chicago...I like Jax but the frozen tundra doesn't favor Florida teams. I wish I could pick Arizona, but they burned me too many times. My long shot is Tennessee...I like Volek.
 
 
Doh. Just noticed I didn't pick the San Diego game.
Oh well, a star crossed week.KC punished me for delivering me the Monday night game and then abandoning them.
 
 
So the early games (including the games on Sat) are over and we can already declare that this week's winner will be PDiddie! PD went 9-1 while rjb was at 8-2, pan was at 7-3 and fbaez bombed at 6-4. (No show again this week from willow or, sadly, from kicky, who started this thread).
The Steelers/Giants game was pretty exciting, wasn't it? Pitts manages to keep on winning. And Carolina/Atlanta was a pretty cool game.
We all pretty much agree on the rest of the games so PDiddie will triumph. What are you going to do with all of that virtual money?
 
 
 
What are you going to do with all of that virtual money?
 

Buy a beer at the next Texans home game.  
 
 
way to go diddie. having won last week I felt a sense of danger in going my own way...and paid the price.
great game in NY...eli is gonna be a star.
 
 
I notice Favre is faking injuries again. I am so sick of that guy. Always looking at his hand. Trotting to the sidelines to be attended to.

The master of the fake injury.

How much attention does that loser need?
 
 
Hi, gus,,,just a few threads down is one called "cheesehead central." Your comment re Favre probably belongs there. Post it at your own peril (heh, hee).
 
 
Gus has been needling "Cheesehead" since I joined here.
 
 
Ouch. We all got burnt in the late games. I've got PDiddie at 10-4; rjb at 9-5, and Fbaez & Pan at 7-7. We all have Indy and NE selected in the night games.
Did I ever mention that I am originally from WI? The Steelers are my team, now, but I will always have a fondness for the Packers.

Thanks, Child, and welcome. I'll try to post this weekend's schedule in a bit. In the meantime, Child, you seem to have left out Philly @ St Louis on Monday night and that game will be the tie-breaker. So I also need your guess as to the total number of points in that game. Thanks for playing.
 
 
Good evening. First of all I note that on my brief, five-mile commute from my store to my home I saw three fender-bender accidents. No injuries, I hope, but a hell of a Christmas "present." Things are getting a bit chaotic out there. Drive defensively and stay off the cell-phone,
WEEK 16 WITH THE USUAL FORMAT. It starts on FRIDAY 12/24 with:

And a post-mortem on Week 15: PDiddie finished at 11-5, rjb at 10-6 and fbaez and pan didn't do too well: 8-8. May we all do better this week WHICH STARTS ON FRIDAY. I'll see if I can lure back kicky and willow. I'll try to check in again late Sunday. I hope you and yours have a fine weekend! Take Care - rjb

I've got Minn, KC, Denver, Indy, Jax, Cinc, Det, Atl, Pitt, Buff, NE, Seattle, Carolina, Wash, Miami and Philly (34 points). Horrible weather in some places in the mid-west. Could be a factor in some non-domed stadiums but I don't know which ones are or aren't. See yall Sunday; have a great Christmas. -rjb

Five players this week. Kicky spent more time explaining why he couldn't play than it would have taken to play. Willow seems to have disappeared completely, just as KC started winning.
I use a yellow highlighter to mark correct guesses and a red one to mark wrong ones. Through the early games (that started on Friday) and ended around 4 pm Sunday (ET) I have PDiddle at 7-2; RJB at 6-3; Pan at 5-4 and Fbaez & Child at (oops) 4-5. Good luck in the late games.
 
 
it doesn't matter who wins what.... the colts saddled by payton manning are winning the super bowl. So who care who wins what....?
 
 
Ummm...I beg to differ...it takes defense to win a Super Bowl...maybe next year?
 
 
Hi, soccamon. Welcome. You are invited to join us for next weekend's games (list to be posted on Wednesday if I get around to it).
So for Week 16. PDid wins again (12-3) through Sunday night's game. Rjb is at 11-4 and since both of us are choosing Philly tonight, I can't catch up. Child, Fbaez and Pan didn't, um, do too well. We won't talk about how un-well they did unless asked.
Next week is another week and could be interesting because some teams (already with a lock on some play-off berth) will be resting their key players and don't care too much about the outcomes of the last, meaningless, games. That makes a certain sense, I guess, but I don't like it.
Finally, I agree with Pan. Defense will decide who wins the Super bowl. And Reggie White, the Minister of Defense: RIP -rjb-
 
 
RIP...agreed
A short rant- Teams rested their stars (Atlanta) and what's up with Jax...pathetic
 
 
Evening, all, and welcome to Week 17-the Last One of regular season play (but the NFL will drag on until Feb 6th). That's like five more weeks!
All of these games will take place on Jan 2nd. May your New Year's resolution to "do better in 2005" come to fruition with your picks here:
NYJets (10-5)(L1) @ St Louis (7-8)(W1)
SanFran (2-13)(L2) @ New Eng (13-2)(W1) NE*
Cin (7-8)(W1) @ Philly (13-2)(L1) Phil*
Minn (8-7)(L1) @ Wash (5-10)(L1)
NewOr (7-8)(W3) @ Car (7-8)(W1)
Miami (4-11)(W2) @ Balt (8-7)(L2)
Cleve (3-12)(L9) @ Hous (7-8)(W2)
Pitts (14-1)(W13!) @ Buff (9-6)(W6) Pitt*
GBay (9-6)(W1) @ Chi (5-10)(L3) G Bay - z
Det (6-9)(W1) @ Tenn (4-11)(L5)
Those are the early games. Later:
Atl (11-4)(L1) @ Seat (8-7)(W1) Atl - z Seat -x
TBay (5-10(L3) @ Az (5-10)(L1)
KC (7-8)(W4) @ San Dieg (11-4)(L1) San Dieg - z
Indy (12-3)(W8) @ Den (9-6)(W1) Indy - z
Jax (8-7)(L1) @ Oak (5-10)(L1)
And Sunday night's cure for insomnia is:
Dallas (6-9)(W1) @ NY Giants (5-10)(L8)

This week I have included an * to indicate a team that has clinched its division and secured home field advantage through the playoffs; a -z- to indicate a team that has clinched a division (but not the home field thingee), or -x- a team that hasn't won its division but is guaranteed of a playoff slot.
It's all too complicated for johnboy (who doesn't follow football that closely). You'd have to check out espn.com for details but, as I understand it the teams with an -*- don't give a rat's ass about this weekend's games; the teams with a -z- might. As for the team with an -x- (Seattle): if they were to lose and St Louis wins, there might have to be a wild-card playoff in the NFC West. You can bet that some TV execs and NFL officials are praying hard, really, really hard, about that.
Thank you for continued interest. -realjohnboy-

PS: Please be sure you make a selection in all 16 games and predict the total number of points in the Dallas-NY Giants game.
 
 
My picks (after tapping the 55-gallon drum of "white-out" I wisely bought to correct the many mistakes I make every day):

New England is going to win the superbowl again. It sucks how they lost to the dolphins though.
 
 
 
New England is going to win the superbowl again. It sucks how they lost to the dolphins though.
 

Don't sleep on Colts and Steelers.
 
 
Colts, next year...they need a couple of cornerbacks.

Steelers...first try is the hardest...

Pats...been there...got the rings
 
 
The Colts are my current Super Bowl pick. The Offense will score nearly everytime, and Edge=Ball Control. If you have the ball for 40 minutes The D isn't working much.
 
 
Good point.Statistics are like bikinis. What they reveal is very interesting, but what they conceal is vital.
 
 
Hah, I like that. Whom do you like then, if not Indy?
 
 
Carolina
 
 
Carolina can definitely get to the Super Bowl. They will most likely have only 1 tough game. But there is no way they can beat the Steelers, Colts, or Pats.
 
 
Probably not...been a stinky year for the NFC. Hard to imagine the NFC's fortunes riding on a receiver named T.O.
 
 
A former Niner. He's a big game receiver, remember 98' against the Packers? Or 02' against the Giants? That 02' game has to be my favorite sports moment ever, until the Cubs win The Series. The thing that bothers me most is that The Niners got a guy named Brandon Whiting in return for T.O.
 
 
I really don't understand what happened to the Niners...
 
 
When you get rid of 2 star lineman(Deese and Stone), a Pro Bowl quaterback(Jeff Garcia), an All Pro WR(Owens), a good RB(Garrison Hearst) and your remaining studs get hurt(Peterson, Newberry, and Barlow), your season isn't looking good.

The early games are over. We all pretty much stink, but I did lure yall into betting against the Steelers. Never bet against the Steelers. Never.
 
 
I don't know dinkum about the NFL but, somehow it seems a little perverse that a team that is 8-8 could still be going on to play next week.
With only tonight's game left, rjb and child are deadlocked at 9-6. Child has the Giants. RJB has the Cowboys. At the end of the night one of them will stand victorious, the other will be humbled by defeat. My bedtime is about 9 pm, so I'll find out tomorrow.
 
 
You know I will win. Hah at your bedtime.
 
 
Looks like I win RealJohnBoy.
 
 
About time..

.Ok Johnny...I suggest one last one for the title of Top Tout Of A2K....

Pick the winners of the playoffs and Super Bowl with total points being the tie breaker in the Super Bowl game.

Everybody in?
 
 
About time? I've won like 3 of these...

But I'm in for the playoff version, should be fun.

Great stuff...everybody has a different take...should be interesting.
 
 
No real surprises though. I wanted to put The Hawks in the big game, but I couldn't.
 
 
Know what you mean...I was the same with Carolina...they kicked me in the gut.

Who was it said: Don't pick against the Steelers?
 
 
RealJohnBoy said that goofy shit. Playoffs are gonna be too much to handle, even for the uberly mature and poised Ben Roethlisberger.
 
 
I usually don't pick a team that hasn't been in the Super Bowl in the last 20 years...they usually do it the second time around...I say they take it next year.
 
 
There are just so many good QB's.

Peyton is gonna win one eventually.
Roethlisberget will win one.
McNabb should get one.
Vick could possibly win one.
Brady will win like 7.
Favre could get another one.

Whose turn is it this year?
 
 
Well put...any ninnie that parrots that old adage about "Defense Wins Superbowls"...Great Quarterbacks that beat great defenses win Superbowls...

Except of course...That Ravens win...lol
 
 
I think it is a combo. A good QB (Good being Brady, not Dilfer) with a great defense can beat a great QB with a shitty defense. The RB is also very important.

But when it is a close game in the 4th, only 1 guy matters.
 
 
This is bad Karma, but here goes:
My thanks to the Child typing out my picks, save the ending!

Seahawks beat Rams
Packers beat Vikings
Indy beats Broncos
Superchargers beat Jay EE Tee Ess Jets Jets Jets

Hawks beat Eagles * 1
Pack beat Falcons
Steelers beat Chargers
Patriots beat Colts * 2

Packers beat Hawks
Patriots beat Steelers

Packers beat Patriots -64 (34-31)

* 1 Changes if T.O plays, but inconsequential as the Packers win the next game anyway.
* 2 Shakiest pick of the group. And possibly the most important factor in whether or not the Packers return the Title to Title Town!
 
 
 
Well put...any ninnie that parrots that old adage about "Defense Wins Superbowls"...Great Quarterbacks that beat great defenses win Superbowls...

Except of course...That Ravens win...lol
 
'85' bears Too!
 
 
Right Bill...I thought about the Bears when i wrote that exception...was McMahon pedestrian?..I can't remember...I remember the Pats sucked and the dolphins didn't do much to protect their record...
 
 
Didn't the 85 Bears have a pretty good running back too?
 
 
The fridge was...ok
 
 
The next few games were typical of the way the '85 Bears handled their opponent. Get an early lead, let the defense dominate the opposition's offense, and give the ball to Walter Payton and let him grind the time off the clock.

Payton was the perfect compliment to the Bears' defense. The defense would hold the opposition to three plays and out, then Walter would keep the clock moving as he moved the chains down the field.

This combination of a great defense and a great running game kept the other teams defense on the field most of the game making it nearly impossible for them to score. The Bears consistently dominated their opponent in time of possession, limiting their chance of scoring against the leagues best defense even more.
 
 
I'm thinking that indy doesn't keep the opps defense on the field long enough...3 plays touchdown!
 
 
 
The Bears consistently dominated their opponent in time of possession, limiting their chance of scoring against the leagues best defense even more.
 

I remember I said something similar to that one time and you said:

 
Statistics are like bikinis. What they reveal is very interesting, but what they conceal is vital.
 

What's up with that?
 
 
You said Indy did it...I said the Bears did it...and I'm saying Indy scores too quickly...
But I'm flattered that you save all my posts.
 
 
I have an insane memory, I seriously remember everything. I remember when I had a spanish thread and you tried to help me with my spanish and I said something that could have been taken as an insult(but it wasn't) and you said "BYE!" and you left the thread.
 
 
McMahon delivered and Sweetness played a huge roll too, but that defense is considered one of the best of all time by most experts. So good that Ditka preferred kicking over receiving.  
 Peter King  said it well.

 
The Bears, many of you will recall, had the best defense between the mid-'70s Steelers and the 2000 Ravens. And Walter Payton made the team peerless, though for far too short a period.
 
 
 
Who beat Da Bear's ass in 84? Was it Joe Cool and The Niners? The glory days indeed.
 
 
Congratulations, Child, on winning Week 17. Why, oh why, did I pick Dallas! I hate Dallas.
So I get home this afternoon and yall seem to be on the verge of a virtual foodfight. Some strutting, some dissing, some grumping about real or imagined insults on other threads. Yall weren't doing all of this at work, were you?
Pan, I was thinking about some sort of parallel game thingee where we would pick this weekend's games and then also have an "all of the marbles" picking that would take us through the Super Bowl. But I didn't know whether to start with whatever this weekend's games are or wait a week. Yall have decided that for me. We start now!
Good to see fbaez back. And welcome to Occum Bill who, of course, goes with the Packers. A bet from the heart but doomed, alas, to disappointment. Johnboy feels a bit superfluous. But that's cool.
 
 
 
And welcome to Occum Bill who, of course, goes with the Packers. A bet from the heart but doomed, alas, to disappointment. Johnboy feels a bit superfluous. But that's cool.
 
Oh no RJB that was no bet from the heart. That's my unbiased opinion. The one from the heart has us winning by way of blowout. :razz:
 
 
Johnboy...remember you're talking to O'Bill.

Way to roll it up into one enchilada.J-Boy..I figured why bet on just 4 games a week...tho I didn't mean to usurp your thread authority...
And Child, we all have our skeletons...just don't move that flashlight around too much.
 
 
Okay. Everyone stand still for a few seconds. Please correct me if I am wrong about the schedule. This coming weekend:
St Louis Rams @ Seattle Seahawks (the winner will be @ Philadelphia Eagles);
Minnesota Vikings @ Green Bay Packers (winner to be @ Atlanta Falcons);
Denver Broncos @ Indianapolis Colts (winning team to be @ New England Patriots);
NY Jets @ San Diego Chargers (winner to be @ Pittsburgh). And then we need to pick on from there. Seems pretty simple. -johnboy (trolling for new players)
 
 
Okay, resume whatever it was you were doing. The bizarre thing is I really don't know squat about nfl football. I have a tv but it hasn't been turned on in months. I am a Steeler's fan only because one of my employees is. He's a Steeler's fan only because his girl friend is from there and her dad is a fan and Andy was looking for something, anything, they could talk about together. My family is from, long ago, Wisconsin. So I reckon I'm a bit of a cheesehead but my roots are now firmly in the red, red clay of Virginia. Anyway, I took over running this thread, after Kicky ran out of steam, despite my knowing very little about the topic. That's all true! Wierd, aint it?
I''m picking Seattle, San Diego, Green Bay and Indy. Then I have Philly, Atlanta, Pittsburg and New England. New England vs Philly at the end with 47 points - favor NE.
 
 
Does anyone Know where I can find a premade playoff pool sheet with the spread and everything that I can print out for work?
 
 
I found this...all the home teams are picked to win with the point margin listed.

LAST CALL for the idiot's guide to NFL. Most of us don't know much about the subject, but we're Americans. Knowing nothing means, um, nothing.

If anyone else would like to play, you are more than welcome to join Child, Pdiddie, Fbaezer, Occum, Johnboy and (I hope) Pan. But you need to join before game time on Saturday. -rjb-
 
 
im guessing we pick for the whole post season, right?
 
 
Yes, you'd better hurry too.
 
 
I say the Packers lose.

Nothing else matters.

Pittsburgh wins the Super Bowl which is a Pennsylvania shoot out 28-24 (52)

I wanted something different!
 
 
I'm worried about Indy vs. Pats now. Indy could easily win, Ty Law is out for playoffs.
 
 
I saw that...they have two cornerbacks out don't they?
 
 
JB am I correct in stating that the winner just has to pick the SB champion with the closest total score?
 
 
 
I saw that...they have two cornerbacks out don't they?
 

I think their 2 starting corners, Ty Law and Tyrone Poole are out. The nickel back, Asante Samuel, is out, and I think the not Rondey Harrison safety is out. That gives them Randall Gay, Troy Brown and 2 nameless fellows back there. God, that can't be good vs. Manning, I think that may cost me the challenge.
 
 
Not so fast Child...there's the other side. Indy's defense will be hard pressed covering Dillon and the recievers. I think the Pats are gonna have to throw more to the tight end....who is capable, but I can't remember his name.
 
 
Pan: You're asking me for a rules clarification? Rules for this game? We don't really have any rules but your suggestion sounds fine to me for our award of the Golden Jockstrap, but the idea is that we're supposed to predict the winners in the games leading up to the last game. I'm thinking you are the final regular player of late we are waiting on, although anyone else is more than welcome to join in.
Today's games start at 4 ET, I think. I could be wrong about that, though.
 
 
 
Not so fast Child...there's the other side. Indy's defense will be hard pressed covering Dillon and the recievers. I think the Pats are gonna have to throw more to the tight end....who is capable, but I can't remember his name.
 

Daniel Graham I think, out of Colorado....He caught a touchdown in the first 5 or so games, so he is definitely capable. They also have Ben Watson, who was their 2nd rounder and Vrabel. Dillon is without a doubt the key, I think he will run wild and make my pick, a good one.
 
 
Hope so

This is the Golden Jockstrap award for all the marbles. It's been a great season although I'm pissed that when I started the betting thread in the second week all the wimps cried;"Spreads are too hard"
So anyway, we have a blueprint for next season and thanks Mr Wahoo for a great job as M.C.

Good Luck all!
 
 
Holmgrown blows yet another playoff game for a share of the record of 6 straight playoff losses. Anybody still wondering why I'm glad to be rid of him?
 
 
Oh, my, Child, Pdiddie, O'Bill, Johnboy and Pan all seemed to have had the Seahawks. Only Fbaezer was wiser. I've got out my red highlighter and it looks like Child and Occum may be on thin ice on that side of the bracket, but both of them love the Packers so all will end up well.
According to ESPN, the late game is scheduled for 9:40 pm ET. That's almost the middle of the night for this puppy. Keep up the chatter. I tried to figure out where everyone is: FL, VA, Mexico, but then I got confused.
 
 
I don't know what's on at 9:40 dude... the second game followed the first... and is, in fact, on right now.
 
 
Relly? Who's playing?
 
 
 
Holmgrown blows yet another playoff game for a share of the record of 6 straight playoff losses. Anybody still wondering why I'm glad to be rid of him?
 

Oh, Holmgren made Engram drop that touchdown? Oh, Holmgren made Bret Favre miss a wide open Freeman against The Broncos?

Did you see that emotion after the game? That man can coach my team anyday, he has so much passion for the game, you gotta love that.
 
 
How happy is Barton?
 
 
A lot happier now...
 
 
Holmgren does suck as a coach in big games. But not as bad as Shottenheimer. Man, both the Jets and the Chargers tried desperately to blow that friggin' game.
 
 
I'm still aghast at the terrible coaching and bone head plays on both sides. I mean come on! After 16 games you're supposed to be a well oiled unit.
The faux pas are too numerous to menrtion but...

Barton, he needs to take football 101 all over again

SD's rookie kicker...Schotty calls 3 stupid plays and they end up on the right hash mark. So the kid promptly kicks it wide right.

Everybody knows that in overtime you kick on third down in case the holder bobbles it.

Hermy takes Martin out on the most important drive and gets into a shouting match with his running back coach...etc...etc

Seattle! At home! On the 3 yard line! 15 seconds left! A catchable pass to win the game! Dropped!

So goes the season...you have to wonder about Holmgren. He doesn't seem to be able to inspire confidence in the team like other coaches do.
 
 
Normally, I wouldn't blame a game on a single play... like the dropped pass for instance. Not in a 60 minute football game. Barton's unbelievable idiocy, on the other hand would have qualified for the distinction. Then there's 10 men on the field followed by a 12 man...   Looked like high school silliness.

How many passes did Seattle drop? None by this fella.

 
You'd first have to put him in the game, and then throw the ball his way.  
 
 
Right Bill...doh...the commentator said :"Where's the greatest receiver in the history of the NFL?
 
 
10 Jets on the field...stupid
10 Jets on the field the next play...stupider
Chargers don't exploit the mistake....priceless
 
 
Right? One would think deep in the red zone you might want one of the finest sets of hands God ever created running a passing route... especially if your guys are dropping passes left and right. And then there's Mike-I'd rather my QB get killed than call a shotgun because I don't believe in the shotgun   -Holmgrown.
 
 
Rice has absolutely no seperation skills or leaping skills, so he'd of been useless on a slant or a fade. I think they should have lined him up at TE and ran a simple curl. But I can't believe Engram dropped that ball...All you ever hear from the critics is that the Seattle receivers suck. Here is his chance to prove them all wrong, and he drops the freakin' ball, what an idiot.

About Nate Kaeding, former Groza Award Winner, most kickers prefer the ball on one of the hashes because a straight kick is the hardest of all kicks.

About Barton, he's a former Raider, what do you expect?

About Pennington, maybe he won some New York sports writer love.

Hopefully the home teams won't suck today.
 
 
Before we begin today's games, I need to note that our colleague Fbaezer, down there in Mexico, had the Rams and the Jets in yesterday's games. Well done.
 
 
 
Hopefully the home teams won't suck today.
 
  Yeah baby!
 
 
 
Fbaezer, down there in Mexico, had the Rams and the Jets in yesterday's games. Well done.
 

I can see picking the Rams, that game was a toss up for me....But how can you pick a team that has a QB that can't throw the ball over 20 yards?? With a 37 year old RB?? No WRs?? Unproven defense?? Shotty special teams??

He has to be a Jets fan, that is the only answer.
 
 
 
About Nate Kaeding, former Groza Award Winner, most kickers prefer the ball on one of the hashes because a straight kick is the hardest of all kicks.
 

Right. Kaeding obviously told Schotty he wanted the ball on the right hashmark so voila...they call Tomlinson off right tackle...sshould of gone for the left mark
 
 
I think nerves made a bigger difference than positioning. A 40 yarder in those conditions can't be easy to make.
 
 
35-3, I predict a Frank Reich style comeback. Jake Plummer will become a legend with the next 3 hours.

So it begins!! 35-10

35-17!!

Nevermind.
 
 
I'm rethinking Colts against anybody...they're scary!
 
 
Remember though, they won't be playing in this vacuum after today.
 
 
good point
 
 
Looks like OccomBill is the first one out...
 
 
That sucked. :sad:
 
 
Boy, the Vikings just game-planned the Pack. Came out, jumped on them early, forced them into abandoning the rush, blahblahblah.

Suddenly Tice looks like a stinkin' genius.

I doubt that will last a week.

Yes, the Jets are my favorite AFC team. Since Broadway Joe said that a good sex session the night before every game improved his performance.
If the Jets were as bad as you say, the would have finished with a losing record. They were impressive in the toughest division in the NFL.
They do have Curtis and I wouldn't say their defense is unproven.
San Diego, on the other hand, is still a team in the making.

I'm not that dumb to make the Jets reach the next stage, though.

Now, the Packers... that was painful.  
 
 
I had a bad reaction to Moss mooning the Green Bay crowd. I mean...it wouldn't bother me if it was the jets fans...but Green Bay?
 
 
I thought they made too big of a deal out of the fake moon. The fans were beating on the man from the get go. My reaction was kind Oooohallright you got us... with a little chuckle. When McMahon did it, 20 years ago, he wasn't faking... and I thought it was funny then too.

 
 
 
Hi...I had to do a bit of dredging to remember where we are all. Everyone happy with choices made? I'll recap who's still alive after Saturday's games on Sunday morning. Good luck, yall!
-johnboy-
 
 
Now this is funny. Fake Moon gets fine of $10,000 despite it being payback to the fans really mooning the Vikings Bus.   When asked for comment Moss said " What the bleep do I care about $10,000. Bleep. I make $10,000 every time I shake my bleep.   (My quotes might be slightly off, but I'm not making this up. I swear!   )
 
 
the jets are up 17-10 late in the 3rd quarter over the steelers  
 
 
Obrien missed two. Think the Jets will trade up for a kicker this year?
 
 
typical jets.
i do like the fact that they made em sweat in steel town...

curtis martin sounds like he's ready for a change of scenery -- he was mighty pissed during the postgame interview...
 
 
Can't blame him...a premier running back...wasted for 5 years.
 
 
Looks like an Eagles-Patriots Super Bowl.
 
 
Ha!
 
 
Hallf of the players are out. They love their Colts.

I picked Pats just to remind everybody.
 
 
Good evening to yall you nice folks and also to gus.

I've got my red highlighter out (bad) and my yellow one (good).
Occumbill went down early with his unwavering loyalty to the Packers. Pdiddie falls today with the defeat of the Colts.
Child, fbaezer, pan and johnboy are still alive.
Johnboy has the most yellow marked teams left (Phil, Atl, NE & Pitts) but he shouldn't/isn't getting cocky.
I can't imagine watching or playing in a game in the cold like the NE game. I know that conditions can and perhaps will get even worse. I would not survive (although, now that I recall, johnboy did survive when the Army decided that it would be amusing to send the southern boy to Ft Dix, NJ, for Basic Training in Nov-Dec. I have never been so cold in my life).
Anyway, I look forward to yalls reviews of this weekend's games and good luck next. -rjb
 
 
Well, anybody that can remember the great championships : Packers-Cowboys on the frozen tundra,
Giants- Colts overtime...Ameche 2 yrd run for all the marbles...had to admit the Pats are like a glory team from the past.
As I pointed out to Child, it's hard to win when your defense is on the field most of the game. 3 drives of over 80 yards...the best linebackers in the game...who needs cornerbacks. Bruschi was the MVP.
Maybe we witnessed this years Super Bowl champion today. If you're a dome team you'd better have home field advantage or you're done.
Kudos to Manning...but...if I had to choose a quarterback I'd take Brady at least til Big Ben isn't wet behind the ears.
A great game.
 
 
 
As I pointed out to Child, it's hard to win when your defense is on the field most of the game. 3 drives of over 80 yards....
 

I told you that.
 
 
OK OK we told each other...lol
 
 
I think the Falcons will beat the eagles 34-21 and vick will have over 100rushing yards and then the pats will shutout the steelers 12-0.
And in the superbowl its the pats over vick and the falcons 21-18 with vinateri winning it again
 
 
there's no way the pats can shut them out in pittsburgh, not with those 2 manimals running the ball...
 
 
I don't know what to think anymore. I picked Steelers but after watching the Pats and Steelers last week I look like a chump.
 
 
The thing that may make the difference in Pats v Steelers is that Belichick
has had time to think about what went wrong last time and lots of
Steelers tape to study. This morning some radio sports pundit said that
Belichick is 13-0 the second time he deals with an opposing quarterback.
 
 
That's what I'm afraid of. And we were speculating that the cornerbacks were out and Indy would rack up 500 yards passing. Well, now we know that the linebackers were who made the cornerbacks so good.
 
 
Good evening yall. Welcome, json_23 to A2K and hi to Region and George for also contributing to this thread.
I mentioned before that, despite my tending to the paperwork involved in running this amusement, I really know little about the NFL. One of my employees is a huge Steelers fan. Andy's comments today:
--The weather in Pitts on Sunday evening could be awful: snow and bitterly cold;
--That could take away the passing game. Pitts runs and defends against the run well. If Ben has to/had to throw 20 times, Pitts loses;
--Neither team is trash talking.
I checked ESPN to find out the game times and noted that the the majority of the "experts" have NE. There also was a consensus in the Atl-Phil game but I can't remember what it was. Phil, I think.
For the record, amongst the four of us still alive when we started this:
Child has NE over Pitts;
fbaezer has Pitts over NE
rjb has Phil over Atl and NE over Pitts;
pan has Phil over Atl and Pitts over NE.
Good luck to us all. Stay warm. 4-8 inches of snow forecast for VA starting early Sat am!
 
 
Thanks RJB we're expecting freeze warnings on Sunday down here in sunny Fla. I have very little hope for the Steelers but I think it'll be a classic game.
 
 
i sincerely hope nobody loses power tmrw from 3-10pm...
 
 
Me, too, Region. We only got about an inch or two of snow/sleet. The bulk of the storm swept up to the NE area which should make Phil and Piits interesting places to be tomorrow. I can't imagine paying money to sit in the stands under those conditions.
Keep the faith, pan, the experts (and rjb) have NE
but the Steelers have a good chance.
(15 degrees in VA and getting windy) -rjb
 
 
Weren't you the one that told me not to cross the steelers? And then you go and switch to the Pats...lol
 
 
Um, pan, I called my friend Karl Rove @ The White House. There is, it turns out, a loophole.
I said never "bet" against the Steelers. I said I like the Steelers and hope they win, but I never said I actually bet on the Steelers vs the Patriots.
I hope that the Steelers win but I'm thinking that the Patriots will win and that is why I chose them.
Have I made my position perfectly clear? -rjb
 
 
Good evening..So Phily wins and it looks like NE will also. fbaezer and panz join occumbill and pdiddie on the sidelines. In the Superbowl, Child has NE with 34 points scored in total; rjb has NE with 47. I doubt that any of the rest of you will pay any more attention.

Thanks, kicky, for starting this thread and thanks to yall for playing each week. I enjoyed the challenge of keeping the game going every week and I even learned some stuff (in this case NFL football) that I wouldn't have otherwise.

It's been fun. -realjohnboy-
 
 
Why don't you just stop this sham and sign off as sandbagger? You know a lot more about the NFL than you let on.
Congrats to Child and RJB for being the winners of the playoffs and may the best man win The Super Bowl
Thanks also rjb for taking over this thread from sloth-man and I hope you'll do the same next year. I know I had a great time.
 
 
"I only know that I know nothing": Socrates and realjohnboy.
 
 
Patriots won. Superbowl will be theirs again as I predicted. :wink:
 
 
The "told-you-so's" chime in  
 
 
Eagles will win because the fates won't allow the patriots to win again AND teh city of Philadelphia needs a championship. I mean the Red Sox already won this year and the Yankees didn't. So I say Eagles over Patriots.
 
 
Eagles, taking the seven points.

And not just because it will piss off Rush Limbaugh...
 
 
El Diablo, can I be your bookie?
 
 
Pdidie and Pan...as I understand it, the Eagles are seven point underdogs so "taking the seven points" and the Eagles mean PD thinks Phill will either win outright or will lose by less then seven? Is that right? Even with the point spread, I'd still choose NE.
 
 
That's right Oh great sandbagger....well....not really...here:

Just imagine that the game starts with Philly ahead by 7 points 7-0. Diddy is betting that Philly will hold the lead... hardee har har.
Remember those real ugly Super Bowls, like Raiders-Redskins?...think along those lines.
 
 
Cool, Pan, I think we're saying the same thing, but perhaps not. Okay, the game "starts" (before kickoff) with Phil up 7 to 0. NE scores a total of 6 points in the game. Phil gets zip. PD wins his bet, right?
My understanding is that the bookie is pretty knowledgeable about the game he is touting but also keeps his books in order. So if too many bets come in on NE despite Philly + 7, he will adjust the spread to say Philly + 10 to attract more bettors to the Philly side. He makes his money when he has the amount wagered on either side equal. A million is wagered on NE - 7 and a million is on Philly +7. He breaks even on that but if the final actual score is NE 14-7 he takes everbody's money. Is that right? Um, who won the Raiders-Redskins?
 
 
My God man! A wahoo that doesn't remember the great shame of Redskins lore. I can't bear to recount that sordid Super Bowl.
And yes, that's how the spread works. It's much more difficult to win the "spread" than "straight up"
 
 
patriots 20
eagles 13
 
 
The Vegas line: Pats - 7
 
 
Pan..."Straight Up" meaning what? How come I sometimes see the spread expressed in a fraction of a point: 6 1/2, for example? Is that for the benefit of the office pool, where no bookie is involved, in order to ensure a winner?
As for Super Bowl lore, I know you don't believe me, but I really don't follow the NFL closely. Really.
I got into running this thread by default without knowing much about the topic.
 
 
I believe as I kid you on your prowess.
Since a half point is impossible it negates ties and further delineates the spread.
Straight up is without a spread. Head to head.
 
 
 
El Diablo, can I be your bookie?
 

Be my guest. Ive predicted all the winners of the playoff games so far in a pool amongst friends. I also picked the exact score of the Rams-Seahawks game. I feel quite confident that Eagles win narrowly.

I'll say 28-26. Risky choice seeing as 26 isnt common but i see the Patriots going for 2 and missing with 2 mins left or less.
 
 
I'm picking the Pats. And they'll beat the spread...by a lot.
 
 
Okay, yall. The winner of the A2K Golden Jockstrap Trophy will either be Child or RJB (based on predictions made publicly prior to the start of the playoffs).
A2K is certainly not a sports place, so unless a new thread appears, post your selection here. No trophy though. Getting the one for the main game was tough enough.
So far:
El-Diablo--- Phil 28 vs NE 26
Region--- NE 20 vs Phil 13
RJB --- NE 31 vs Phil 17
Child --- NE 24 vs Phil 10
Kicky --- NE 33 vs Phil 14
George --- NE 24 vs Phil 20
CowDoc --- NE 27 vs Phil 24
Pdiddie --- NE 30 vs Phil 27
Pan --- NE 34 vs Phil 17
 
 
Pats 24-10
 
 
Pats 33-14
 
 
Who cares? :sad:
 
 
(says occum bill, grumpily)
 
 
NE 24 vs Phil 20

I'm picking the Pats, but it worries me to hear so much confidence.
We New Englanders need worry, doubt, and disrespect to really feel
comfortable.

Remember, gentlemen - in the spirit of Grantland Rice, "It isn't whether you win or lose, it's the point spread that really matters." A friend of mine gave me Philly and eight for a fifth of whiskey this week, and I feel pretty good about it. I look for a close game, and since New England has a habit of winning games on last-second field goals from Adam Vinatieri, I see nothing on the horizon to buck that trend. The jokers I see in the deck are: 1. The Patriots have not faced a team with a mobile quarterback. McNabb could present a challenge.
2. The Eagle defense is seriously underrated. I do not expect the Pats to maintain a ball control offense with Corey Dillon carrying to load.
All in all, I'm just looking forward to an interesting matchup. Have a great weekend!
 
 
Interesting prognosis and kudos to your friend for offering 8.

Bully to all that.

If it comes down to a last-minute -- or last-second -- field goal again, then good on the Patriots. Bu that won't cover the point spread.

I likewise think the Pats are overrated by most. Hell, Carolina's offense, led by the incomparable Jake Delhomme, moved the ball all over the field on them last year. They did, however, shut down Peyton Manning, which I thought they couldn't do (even if they slobbed out their home field to accomplish the feat).

Should be a close game, unless the Iggles get the yips. It took them three (or is it four?) tries just to get here, after all...
 
 
I don't think we should let pass acknowledgment of the retirement of Emmitt Smith this week (and no sense in starting another thread, since all the football fans are here).

I put this on my blog and I'll drop it in here also:

When I was kid, I was a Cowboys fan. Those were the days of Roger Staubach and Bob Lilly and Drew Pearson, whom we'd impersonate at halftime when we went outside to re-enact our version of that Sunday's blowout of some hapless opponent. As I grew older, I drifted away from the 'Pokes as a favorite, mostly because I tend to root for the underdog in nearly all things.

So the Cowboys of Jerry Jones and Jimmy Johnson and Troy Aikman and Michael Irvin weren't so popular with me. Oh, I rooted for them, but as with most dynasties I wasn't rabid about it.

With much respect I note the retirement today of Emmitt Smith, and in this article (it's no longer available online; it came from Yahoo Sports news) I am reminded why I admired him, much more so than his teammates named above:

 
But despite his impressive statistics, he won just two major awards in 15 seasons -- NFL MVP in 1993 and the Super Bowl MVP that same season, when he rushed for 130 yards and two touchdowns in the Cowboys' 30-13 win over Buffalo in Atlanta.

He won those despite missing the first two games of that season in a contract dispute with Jones. Smith finished that regular season with perhaps his greatest game, an overtime win over the New York Giants at the Meadowlands.

The Cowboys and Giants were both 11-4. The winner got the NFC East title, home-field advantage in the playoffs and a first-round bye. The loser got a wild-card game the following week.

Smith separated his shoulder in the third quarter but returned to the game, which went into overtime tied at 13. He carried the ball on nine of the Cowboys' 11 plays in the extra period at one point raising his aching shoulder to stiff-arm Lawrence Taylor on his final run, which set up Eddie Murray's game-winning field goal.

He finished with 229 total yards and a touchdown on 32 carries and 10 receptions, the heaviest workload in team history, then spent the night in a hospital.

Had the Cowboys lost that game, Smith probably wouldn't have been able to play the following week in a wild-card game. That would have made the road much more difficult in what turned out to be the Cowboys' second of three Super Bowl victories in four seasons.
 

Few men set a better example on the field or off as the kind of player anyone, friend or foe, could admire. If Emmitt Smith's post-NFL career is as successful as his playing days, then he should go into the Human Being Hall of Fame as well.
 
 
Well stated, PDiddie, re Emmitt Smith.

PDiddie, pan, CowDoc and anyone else is invited to submit a prediction of the final score. The so-called experts are leaning (actually not just leaning but jumping in with both feet) in favor of NE.
 
 
Amen, Pdiddie - Emmitt's been a class act for fifteen years, and that seems to be sorely lacking in today's NFL. Just for you, Johnboy, and I don't have strong feelings on this, Patriots 27-24. However, an Eagle win would not shock me in the slightest. The true matchup here is on the sidelines. These are two excellent coaching staffs.
 
 
What's the over/under? Going off to check...

48.

Patriots 30-27.
 
 
I wish the Eagles well, but it's hard to win on your first try.I'll take the over. Pats 34-17
 
 
what the hell is over/under? I have this image growing in my mind of yall wearing plaid pants, smoking cigars and getting in nine holes of golf before noon and then lounging around the clubhouse swapping lies and calling your bookies.

 http://gridirongold.com/superbowlodds.htm 

There are hundreds of bets that can be made...here's a list.
 
 
Five things to watch:

1. Jeremiah Trotter vs. Corey Dillon

2. Brian Westbrook's hands and Donovan McNabb's legs

3. Patriots defensive backs vs. Eagles receivers

4. Blitzes

5. Final possession: Brady and Adam Vinatieri vs. McNabb and David Akers

 What to watch 
 
 
Have you guys noticed there hasn't been one female betting here? Care to know why?

It's to complicated, I almost joined in, and then I saw the over/under thing, and now I'm lost.

Paula (wants to play, but the party's getting rough) j
 
 
Not betting, but all I gotta say is...

GO EAGLES  

([size=7]Yeah, yeah, I know.....they're gonna lose.)[/size]

Might watch for the commercials.....the rest doesn't interest me that much.
 
 
 
Paula (wants to play, but the party's getting rough) j
 

Just tell who you think will win, paula.
 
 
Paula. Just predict the winner and the final score.

The talk about odds, spreads, over/unders was in reponse to my questions about the whole bookmaking/gambling thing which, clearly, one or more of the folks here knows a bit about.

Please make your simple prediction of how the onfield game ends up. Thanks.
 
 
Pats.......31-20
 
 
I say-

NE--26 - 14
 
 
Da......Pats.

Anyone see Friday Night Lights?

T.O. going down.
 
 
How do some of these football announcers keep their jobs? Terry Bradshaw is about as funny as cancer. He tries, though.
 
 
I think cancer of the penis is kinda funny.
 
 
Slappy, I think with Bradshaw it's the sympathy factor.

Friday Night Lights was an awesome book and Thornton finally has a good role.My fave football movies are: North dallas Forty and Clash Of The Titans, about our rival high school in Northern Virginia and the first years of school integration
 
 
 
My fave football movie
 

is hands-down... the longest yard.

mean machine
mean machine
mean machine
MEAN MACHINE!!
 
 
I'm with Region.

That is a great movie!
 
 
Adam Sandler thinks so too.
How about them eaglets...they're a fine team. I sold them short.
 
 
Well it went pretty much as I expected, except I thought McNabb would make a little better showing than he did. Oh, well, my Maker's Mark should taste just as good anyway!
 
 
24/21 New England wins, but Philli made a game of it and deserved to be there.
 
 
PATS, BABY!!!!

My neighbors again must hate me. Yelling out the window after every New England score.

That was a great game. My fingernails are a bit shorter right now.
 
 
Vince Lombardi and us!
 
 
So looks like I win, no real surprise.
 
 
DAMN!

I ahte New England.

I still won a shitload of money though because of the blessed point spread.
 
 
deion branch outplayed owens -- sweeeeeet...
 
 
Question for you guys on TO:

He's kind of a hated guy, flamboyant, ect. Do you think he got undeserved criticism for playing? Some people called him "selfish?" I'm thinking how Curt Schilling was a hero among heros, and I can't see someone calling Brady selfish if he played while hurt. I know they're different situations...

But I can't help to think people were bashing him for once when he didn't deserve it. And I'm not saying this in hindsight, I thought it before the game too.
 
 
 
I ahte New England.
 

Why do you ahte N.E.? Didn't you eat breakfast yet? Are you english by any chance?

I have a lot of questions.

Child, stop gloating.

That point would have been brought up by countless sports writers, and for once TO would have been praised. But, right after his team suffered the most demoralizing loss imaginable, he goes and starts bitching like a gigantic vagina about how playing hurt makes him selfish. "If a guy like Bret Farve would have done it, you guys would be calling him a warrior.". That's right dickhead, because warriors go into battle without expecting a fuckin' mountain load of praise when they get back.

TO abandoned the 49er organization, abandoned the 49er players and fans, abandoned The Ravens organization, players and fans, and after his team loses the Super Bowl, he abandons The Eagles players by bitching about how everyone talks bad about him, what a fuckin' douche.
 
 
As for T.O.'s movitvations, I couldn't care less. He was obviously well
enough to play and I have to admit, he was no mere "cameo" or "decoy".
I'll give him his due for contributing to the team whatever his
reasons. Just don't ask me to listen to him before or after a game.
Or for that matter, during.

I'd say the criticism "for playing" is totally undeserved. That was Andy Reid's decision, wasn't it?
 
 
You had to love T.O. yelling at McNabb to relax on the sidelines. Donovan was a little wired toward the end.
 
 
Boy, I'll say! But the whole team seemed to be wading through water
when they should have been hustling to make the most of the time
remaining.
 
 
McNabb threw some absolute DUCKS.

While Brady may not have the physical tools some other guys have, he very rarely throws up balls like that.
 
 
good point.Brady's self-discipline is what sets him apart.
 
 
yep, the kid's poise under pressure is something QB's usually don't yet have at that age...
 
 
Hi. Computer problems on Sunday left me out of the loop & I'm back on A2K under a new name.
Yall have pretty much said it all. Philly got out-coached. On your own four with time running out?
For gods sake have two or three or four plays called. bam, bam, bam. They stood around looking quite bewildered.
So in the big trophy chase that we started prior to the playoffs, child and rjb both had NE and child said the total number of points would be 34. rjb said 47. Final score of 24-21 adds up to, um 45.
I have no idea who won the come-lately guess of the actual winner and score of the big game itself.
Again, thanks for playing. See you next year.
 
 
Hey whateveryournameis...good job on the season AND winning the Golden Jockstrap award. See you next year...unless someone has a pick for the pro bowl?
 
 
And George wins the Johnny Come Lately award for precision. He called it 24-20...one point off.
 
 
Thank you.
I bow to your broad knowledge of football. I'm just a Boston/New England homer.

A2K's NFL Golden Jockstrap Tropy Quest
So I am in my garage, sorting screws and washers at my workbench, and I hear on Fox Sports Radio that the NFL teams have started training for the upcoming season. I look up and see the awesome Golden Jockstrap Trophy from last year. Covered with quite a bit of sawdust, but still pretty damn an impressive piece of sculpture. It sat on my mantle for about an hour. I went to the bathroom and when I came back it had been relegated in my abscence to the garage. That's how impressive it is.
Some people just don't appreciate art.
So the start of the NFL season is a mere month away and we will begin our weekly predictions of the outcomes of the games.

Not to worry if you don't know squat about football. Most of the rest of us don't either. Pick the home teams, or pick because you have friends in some of the cities involved. A2K is not big on sports. Last year we had about a half a dozen regular players. Shooting for a dozen this year.

Johnboy administered the game for much of the year last time. If someone else would like to do it, please feel free to commit to it. It takes about two or three hours a week spread out over several days and over the whole season from August-January.

If you are interested in playing please mark this thread and you will be reminded when the season begins.

The trophy is, I think, awesome. You will be proud to display it wherever you are allowed to put it. -rjb-
 
 
The Golden Jockstrap trophy.

 

or perhaps...

 

Warning: Do NOT Google images of "golden jockstrap" unless you are prepared to view nearly one thousand mostly homoerotic photos.

(Count me in again this year, John. Might pass on the trophy should I win.)
 
 
Looking forward to a re-match
 
 
It's next year.... G.B. over N.E 48 to 41 for an NFL record! :cool:
 
 
Ouch. That post before pan's was scary. I noticed that, when I was reviewing who all had posted last season, that one of the posters may have been quite young (judging from some comments in his profile - perhaps 15 or so). I would gently suggest that we remember that. Thank you.
 
 
I'll play along.
 
 
All right my man! Welcome to the A2K sports pool. Let's see if you can keep up with our swami.
