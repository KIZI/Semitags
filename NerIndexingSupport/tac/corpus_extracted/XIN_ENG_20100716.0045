YANGON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has laid a 24-inch natural gas pipeline,
transmitting gas produced from the Yadana gas field in Mottama offshore area to
gas distribution camp of Ywama in Yangon to be further distributed for domestic
use since mid-June.

It is believed that with the availability of the transmitted gas, gas-run power
plants will be able to generate more electricity to satisfy the demand of Yangon
residents, said the official daily New Light of Myanmar Friday.

In Myanmar, energy demand is high as construction and infrastructure development
tasks are booming. In addition to above- ground resources, Myanmar is also
blessed with rich underground resources including oil and gas.

There were 19 onshore oil and gas fields before 1988 but the number had reached
31 after 1988. Many more new onshore and offshore oil and gas fields were found
one after another over the past more than 20 years.

The newly-explored onshore oil and gas fields mainly went to Kyaukkwet, Aphyauk,
Nyaungdon, Thagyidaung-Sabei, Indaw, Htangaing and Maubin, while the five newly-
developed offshore gas fields are marked as Yadana in Mottama, Yedagun in
Tanintharyi, Sein in Mottama, Shwe in Rakhine and Zawtika in Mottama.

According to the geological condition, Myanmar has 14 geological valleys in the
onshore regions, among which the state- run Myanmar Oil and gas Enterprise
(MOGE) has conducted surveys in the central region, Pyay and Delta regions.

It was reported that there remain many more promising regions for exploitation
of oil and gas in the country.

Working in joint venture with foreign companies, the MOGE has signed 46
production-sharing contracts on producing gas in the onshore regions since 1988
up to now, according to reports.

At present, 11 agreements for 11 blocks in onshore regions are active, while 30
out of 31 contracts for offshore blocks are ongoing.

Myanmar became a natural gas exporting country in 1998 and has since 2000 stood
a leading gas exporting country  in the Asia Pacific region.

Experts estimated that the  Yadana gas project  can produce 5.7 trillion cubic
feet (TCF) or 161.4 billion cubic-meters of gas. Adding that produced from the
Sein and Padamya gas fields in the same area, the total will be 6.5 TCF.

The total cost of the project is 1.09 billion U.S. dollars.

Beginning 1998, Myanmar sold 525 million cubic feet (MCF) of gas per day to
Thailand under a 30-year contract. The sale quantity has been increased to 700
MCF now including the Sein block's.

For domestic use, Yadana gas field is transporting 110 MCF of gas per day to
Yangon.

Meanwhile, the Yetagun gas project, launched in 1992, is estimated to be able to
produce 3.167 TCF and 84.36 million barrels of condensate.

The total cost of the Yetagun project stood 642 million dollars.

Beginning 2000, a total of 200 MCF of gas from the Yetagun were also sold to
Thailand per day with the amount being increased to 400 MCF now.

The Yetagun project also produces 12,000 barrels of condensate per day.

Summing up the  sale of gas from the two projects, it shows over 1 billion cubic
feet of gas being piped to Thailand.

In the latest development, oil and natural are being exploited at new blocks
such as MD-4 in the west of Dawei, Tanintharyi division, MD-5 in the west of
Palaw and MD-6 on the west of Myeik which were found in Mottama offshore deepsea
region.

In view of the new development, experts said Myanmar has good prospects in the
energy sector in the future.
