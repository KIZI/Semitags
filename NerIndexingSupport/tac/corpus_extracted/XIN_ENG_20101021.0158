The new state flag of the Republic of the Union of  Myanmar was hoisted in front
of the Office of the Prime Minister in the new capital of Nay Pyi Taw Thursday
afternoon shortly after some laws concerning state flag, state seal and national
anthem were enacted by the ruling State Peace and Development Council, state
radio and TV reported.

The new state flag hoisting ceremony was attended by Prime Minister U Thein
Sein.

Other government departmental offices in the new capital also launched such
flag-hoisting ceremony on the same day.

In Yangon, similar state-hoisting ceremony was also held in front of the City
Hall simultaneously, saluted by Yangon Mayor U Aung Thein Lin.

Myanmar started to use the new flag officially on Thursday after the SPDC
announced through radio and television enactment of laws on state flag, state
seal and national anthem.

The state flag, state seal and national anthem had been prescribed in the new
state constitution of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar approved through a
national referendum in May 2008.

The concerned laws were promulgated by the SPDC as a preparatory work to bring
the constitution into operation before the parliamentary election set for Nov.
7, according to the announcement.
