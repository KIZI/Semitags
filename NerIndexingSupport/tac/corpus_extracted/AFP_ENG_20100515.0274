British airspace could be subject to partial closures from Sunday due to the
volcanic ash cloud, the Department for Transport said.

The disruption could last until Tuesday and could affect Britain's main airports
around London, the ministry warned Saturday.

"Within this timeframe, different parts of UK airspace -- including airspace in
the southeast -- are likely to be closed at different times," the DfT said.
