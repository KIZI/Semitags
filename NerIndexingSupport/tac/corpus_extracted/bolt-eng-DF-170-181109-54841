 Maine Gay Marriage Legalized 

Maine Governor John Baldacci signed Wednesday into law a bill legalizing gay marriage in the state. The move makes Maine the fifth state to allow gay marriage.
The press release:
 
Governor John E. Baldacci today signed into law LD 1020, An Act to End Discrimination in Civil Marriage and Affirm Religious Freedom.
"I have followed closely the debate on this issue. I have listened to both sides, as they have presented their arguments during the public hearing and on the floor of the Maine Senate and the House of Representatives. I have read many of the notes and letters sent to my office, and I have weighed my decision carefully," Governor Baldacci said. "I did not come to this decision lightly or in haste."
"I appreciate the tone brought to this debate by both sides of the issue," Governor Baldacci said. "This is an emotional issue that touches deeply many of our most important ideals and traditions. There are good, earnest and honest people on both sides of the question."
"In the past, I opposed gay marriage while supporting the idea of civil unions," Governor Baldacci said. "I have come to believe that this is a question of fairness and of equal protection under the law, and that a civil union is not equal to civil marriage."
"Article I in the Maine Constitution states that 'no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law, nor be denied the equal protection of the laws, nor be denied the enjoyment of that person's civil rights or be discriminated against.'"
"This new law does not force any religion to recognize a marriage that falls outside of its beliefs. It does not require the church to perform any ceremony with which it disagrees. Instead, it reaffirms the separation of Church and State," Governor Baldacci said.
"It guarantees that Maine citizens will be treated equally under Maine's civil marriage laws, and that is the responsibility of government."
"Even as I sign this important legislation into law, I recognize that this may not be the final word," Governor Baldacci said. "Just as the Maine Constitution demands that all people are treated equally under the law, it also guarantees that the ultimate political power in the State belongs to the people."
"While the good and just people of Maine may determine this issue, my responsibility is to uphold the Constitution and do, as best as possible, what is right. I believe that signing this legislation is the right thing to do," Governor Baldacci said.
 

 
 
Go Maine!
 
 
Ah, yes, that's the way to do it: legislatively.

 
 
 
 
Ah, yes, that's the way to do it: legislatively.

 
 
Technically, the people doing it judicially were only enforcing what the people doing it legislatively did when they put things like "equality" and "equal protection under the law" in their constitutions. If they didn't want to have to live up to what those words mean, then they shouldn't have put them in their state constitutions.

Also: congratulations on joining the rest of the modern world, Maine!
 
 
Well... that's another... and Pyrite actually makes a good point.
 
 
But now the debate is raging on whether or not Gay Lobsters can be legally married...

I am not a fan of this Governor but I agree that he made the right choice, I say people can not help who they love.

So when are you moving to Maine?
 
 
Gay divorce is right around the corner.
 
 
 
Gay divorce is right around the corner.
 
Statistically speaking, gay couples tend to break up far less often than straight couples... but yeah.

Maybe it's because they don't have as many choices/opportunities.

But, got proof?

Well KK, you did say statistically speaking.

You could have just made something up!  

I'm sure just like the hetero couples, divorces will be filed down the road. Shouldn't be any different than any other divorce, just follow the laws.

Unless, the overturn the decision, then are the couples who got married still married?

Way to go Maine.   The sooner all states adopt the same position the better, IMO, then we can hopefully put an end this stupid issue.

Only personal experience... until they are allowed to marry everywhere there is no proof either way...  
 
Then, you don't have statistics, do you?
Way to make things up.  
 
What.. so the only statistics that are valid are those "approved" by one specific group, organization, or what? Statistics are just numbers based on an observation, my personal experience shows that there is a 75% chance a straight couple will split up within 5 years of starting the relationship while gay couples have only a 20% chance... there, does that make the statistic more valid since I gave numbers to it?

Your personal claims are not proof of anything nor statistics.
You got caught, and now you are trying to back peddle.
Just for that, you deserve another one,

When you move there with me, sweetheart!

Gee, maybe I will just fling our my personal observations and call them valid statistics.

Here's one of my personal observations.......
I've had four friends in my life that I knew were gay. 3 of them died from AIDS, therefore, if you are gay and a friend of mine and I know you are gay, you have a 75% chance of dieing of AIDS.
Now doesn't that just sound ridiculous?
 
 
 
Gay divorce is right around the corner.
 
And gay marriage and divorce effect your daily life how?

No, and if there weren't any observed contradictions from the medical community then I would be able to say you were wrong, only offer my own statistics to counter with... of course if you really knew much about how they get most statistics used by the government you really wouldn't listen to any of those published.

So, an actual news article based upon Pink News, not exactly an unbiased source now, is it? I don't see where it was a scientifically peer reviewed study.
But at least you came up with something other than your own personal opinion.
Maybe it's true, maybe it's not. I never made a claim either way, all I asked for was proof. But, personally, I don't find Pink News to be a reliable source for that type of information, do you?

I'm not assuming anything, I merely flung out an observation of mine, the same way you flung out an observation of yous, and you tried to call it a statistic. Remember?
I was pointing out the flaw in your argument.

As I stated, a statistic is a mathematical representation of an observation, nothing more in most cases, even those that are "scientific" are often just observational.

Not that I ever claimed mine were, I merely used that as an example to point out how ridiculous your claim was.

As I clarified earlier, there are no studies done other than the one posted, which you suspect just because of who did it, so there is nothing more to say other than what I know based on what I have witnessed first hand. All studies are easy to show bias, so there is no point in using other statistics most times, nitpicking it does nothing to prove your case though.
 
 
So when does Maine and these other States authorize Incestuous relationships?
 
 
 
So when does Maine and these other States authorize Incestuous relationships?
 
What would be the rationale for that? Are incestuous couples denied the right to file a joint tax return or something?
 
 
it would have been better for Maine had they just got the state out of the marriage business
but it figures this stupid state wouldnt do it the right way
they dont do anything else the right way
 
 
 
 
 
 Maine Gay Marriage Legalized 

Maine Governor John Baldacci signed Wednesday into law a bill legalizing gay marriage in the state. The move makes Maine the fifth state to allow gay marriage.
The press release:
 
So when are you moving to Maine?
 
When you move there with me, sweetheart!
 
stay where you are, you couldn't stand it up here
sometimes the power goes out, and the heating doesn't work
and when that happens you have to do something more effective than whine on the internet and bitch at some low level bureaucrat on the phone
 
 
 
it would have been better for Maine had they just got the state out of the marriage business
but it figures this stupid state wouldnt do it the right way
they dont do anything else the right way
 
The government is already involved in marriage, unless you are advocating they remove all legal effects of marriage then your point is moot.

The entire argument of the left is that gay marriage is all about two consenting adults that love each other and so should have the right to marry. Well then two adults that happen to love each other that do NOT have the right to marry would be incestuous relationships. And no they do not have the same rights as Gays now have in Maine.

Where is the outrage, the demands for equality, the insistence that what two consenting adults want to do is not the States business?

why limit it to just 2 consenting adults
if 2 women want to be married to one man(or vice versa) what business is it of the state?

Gay divorce is right around the corner.
 
And gay marriage and divorce effect your daily life how?
 
I don't know, you tell me.
I was merely pointing out something that will happen.
 
Again, why did you point it out? Who cares if gay divorce happens? It's irrelevant. Just as gay marriage is. It is a completely irrelevant issue for a majority of Americans... probably around 80-90%. It is none of our business what people do and who people love. The government should not restrict that. Let them all get married, let them all adopt and let them all get divorced and be like the rest of us... because, with the exception of being gay, they are like the rest of us.
 
 
 
 
 
And gay marriage and divorce effect your daily life how?
 
I don't know, you tell me.
I was merely pointing out something that will happen.

So you support Incestuous relationships? And multiple partners legally married?
 
 
 
So when does Maine and these other States authorize Incestuous relationships?
 
I didn't realize incest was against the law? As far as I know, two people can have a relationship if they both choose to be. As far as marriage - I don't think there are any problems with that. All you need to get a marriage certificate are two driver's liscenses... soooo....

I don't really understand the problem with incest anyway. If two people love each other, and both are of consenting age, let them do what they want. The government's involvement with marriage is for tax purposes - not moral purposes.
 
 
 
it would have been better for Maine had they just got the state out of the marriage business
but it figures this stupid state wouldnt do it the right way
they dont do anything else the right way
 
Maine has state income tax, which means it matters to them. And again, it's about rights. A gay couple should be able to have the same rites as a straight couple. For instance, they should be able to decide when to take someone off of life support if there is little to no chance of meaningful recovery. There are a billion other instances. You can't just say "stay out of the marriage business" because it's not just marriage... it's rites. If a gay couple have raised a child for 10 years and one of them dies, who's going to take care of that child if the dead person has no other family? Are you going to place it in child services when one of his or her parents that have raised the child for 10 years is perfectly able to raise the child by themselves?

Come on. Have a little heart here.
 
 
 
 
 
So when does Maine and these other States authorize Incestuous relationships?
 
What would be the rationale for that? Are incestuous couples denied the right to file a joint tax return or something?
 
The entire argument of the left is that gay marriage is all about two consenting adults that love each other and so should have the right to marry. Well then two adults that happen to love each other that do NOT have the right to marry
 
I don't really think the State would know or really care for that matter. I don't think incesteous marriage is banned.

all of that can be done without marriage
and quite frankly, the state shouldnt have anything to do with a religious ceremony(marriage is one)

Yeah, why not? Who cares what they do? Life is too short. I mean, as long as the people are of the legal age of consent, yeah why not? How is Joe Schmoe off in Cleavland, OH hurting you by deciding he wants two wives? As long as both wives are fine with it - great! Abraham had several wives, I believe.

But if a guy wants to have 2 wives, who cares what he does? My morals and my values are for my family and my family only.

So then athiests shouldn't get married? What if I can't find a Rabbi I want and I want a judge to marry me?
 
 
man, HOW are republicans going to win elections if gay marriage doesn't end up destroying the fabric of the nation, when everyone still gets to keep their guns, and when the long awaited invasion of america by muslim hordes never materializes?

they can do what anyone that want s legal civil union could do
get a civil union contract for all the rights formerly associated with marriage(that never should have been tied to marriage in the first place)
 
 
After all this I still don't get why people are so worried about them calling it marriage, why does that bother people so much, it's just a fucking word! Hell, nuts marry bolts, solder marries wire together, code marries users to their computers... really... how much importance do you place on a word?

I don't disagree with the idea on this - but unfortunately, government is too deeply involved with marriage. So, as long as that happens, gay people can get married.

Easy. Conservatives don't like change, they pretty much are creeped out by gays, and they think gays need to be cured.

That said, I think we are witnessing the utter collapse of the anti-gay, anti-equality Conservative coalition in this country. It is astonishing how rapidly things are changing.

uh, conservatives have blocked every attempt at gay equality for the last 20 years.

Liberals and progressives have been at the forefront of gay equality, and every other single movement for social justice in the last 100 years. Cons have been MIA

If you're embarrased by that, maybe you belong to the wrong ideology. I'm not embarrased of my ideology.

Where is the outrage, the demands for equality, the insistence that what two consenting adults want to do is not the States business?
 
Oh fuck whether it's left or right. Who gives a crap? It's the right thing to do. They're not getting married in church, and they should have the same rights under the law that straight people have.

I would disagree more but I can't be bothered.

Not completely true. Obama has said that he will not oppose the right of states to allow gays to marry, and wants to construct a federal civil union legally identical to marriage. Bush championed and signed the DOMA in order to prevent gay marriages from ever becoming nationally recognized. Obama does not have the best possible stance in regards to gay marriage, but at least he is willing to step out of the way for it.

So when does Maine and these other States authorize Incestuous relationships?
 
It's right around the corner. So is legalizing pedophilia if the sickos have their way. Homosexuality is perversion, pure and simple, and the perverts have waged a FULL BLOWN WAR against ANYONE who would DARE speak out against them. After they ruin the institution of marriage, they'll move on to the next step, and I can guarantee you RGS, it will either be pushing for acceptance of incest or pedophilia, or both. These perverts won't stop with marriage.

They have a fight though. Normal people don't like these liberal shit bag judges legislating from the bench. Iowa already has problems with their newly passed homo marriage law. It's being challenge by the people, because it WASN'T the PEOPLE of Iowa that said they wanted it. It was EIGHT PEOPLE with enough power to impose THEIR WILL on the people, AGAINST the will of the people. I'd BET the same is true in Maine. That's the ONLY way these liberal homo agenda activists can do their dirty deeds, because when ever they put these laws up for public vote, they get VOTED DOWN.

My bad. I took that as a criticism.
 
 
 
 
Ah, yes, that's the way to do it: legislatively.

 
 
Technically, the people doing it judicially were only enforcing what the people doing it legislatively did when they put things like "equality" and "equal protection under the law" in their constitutions. If they didn't want to have to live up to what those words mean, then they shouldn't have put them in their state constitutions.

Also: congratulations on joining the rest of the modern world, Maine!
 
Bullshit. The people using the judiciary do so to backdoor the legislature. It's the wrong way to do it. Period.
 
 
I JUST HEARD on the news that the governor of maine hasn't signed this homo marriage bill yet. They just said he's still undecided. He probably has enough insight to see that it will probably be challenged and lose in a public vote, and wants to forgo the whole mess.

Gay divorce is right around the corner.
 
Statistically speaking, gay couples tend to break up far less often than straight couples... but yeah.
 
Statistically speaking, there are no stats to make comparisons with. Gays haven't had the institution of marriage but for a few years. Wait until the novelty wears off.

Actually statistics have been compiled about homo couples that live together, and they are in fact much more tumultuous than heteros. There's far more domestic violence, cheating, depression and drug use. This has all been posted many, many times over the years here. I could dig it all up again but anyone can find this info with a simple google search.

Statistically speaking, there are no stats to make comparisons with. Gays haven't had the institution of marriage but for a few years. Wait until the novelty wears off.
 
Actually statistics have been compiled about homo couples that live together, and they are in fact much more tumultuous than heteros. There's far more domestic violence, cheating, depression and drug use. This has all been posted many, many times over the years here. I could dig it all up again but anyone can find this info with a simple google search.

You'll have to prove that KK... I'm not going to just take your word for it, because I think you're wrong.

I know I'm right, so if you feel inclined to prove you are, so will I.

Meh, you can only find biased sources one way or the other online so the point of "proof" is moot. Mine comes from beat cops, who I have as friends... sort of, I feel more comfortable talking to them in person than most people and when I sit in a coffee shop I usually strike up a conversation with them. Back to the topic, they are the ones I get a lot of my statistics on crime from.

The truth about homosexual relationships

Are same-sex partnerships deserving of the same status as traditional marriage? Are they merely a variation of the same type of relationship? No way, says Dr. Timothy Dailey, senior fellow in the Center for Marriage and Family Studies at the Family Research Council. In the FRC report Comparing the Lifestyles of Homosexual Couples to Married Couples, Dailey analyzes more that 30 years of research by social scientists worldwide, and confirms that same-sex relationships have little resemblance to faithful, monogamous marriage.

Duration of Relationships

Homosexual activists often argue that high divorce rates demonstrate traditional marriage fares no better than same-sex relationships in duration. “The research, however, indicates that male homosexual relationships last only a fraction of the length of most marriages,” Dailey notes:

• A 1997 national survey of 884 men and 1,288 women published in the Journal of Sex Research found that 77 percent of married men and 88 percent of married women had remained faithful to their marriage vows.

• A 2002 U.S. Census Bureau study found that 70.7 percent of women married between 1970 and 1974 reached their tenth anniversary and 57.7 percent stayed married for 20 years or longer.

• In a survey of 7,862 homosexuals, the 2003-2004 Gay/Lesbian Consumer Online Census found that of those involved in a “current relationship,” only 15 percent described their current relationship as having lasted 12 years or longer.

Meaning of “Commitment”

Dailey found that even in so-called “committed” homosexual relationships, commitment typically does not mean sexual fidelity:

• A Canadian study of homosexual men who had been in committed relationships lasting longer than one year found that only 25 percent of those interviewed reported being monogamous.

• In The Male Couple, authors David P. McWhirter and Andrew M. Mattison reported that, in a study of 156 males in homosexual relationships lasting from one to 37 years, only seven couples had a totally exclusive sexual relationship, and these men all had been together for less than five years.

• In their classic 1978 study, published as Homosexualities: A Study of Diversity Among Men and Women, researchers Bell and Weinberg found that 43 percent of white male homosexuals had sex with 500 or more partners, with 28 percent having one thousand or more sex partners.

Not a Healthy Lifestyle

Same-sex relationships are notoriously unhealthy and dangerous. Even those that might be labeled “monogamous” (as homosexuals define the term) would be considered high-risk by most accounts:

• The July 1993 issue of the journal AIDS reported that homosexual men involved in steady relationships engaged in unsafe sexual practices more often than homosexual men without a steady partner. Such practices are directly linked to AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.

• The July 2001 issue of GayHealth reported that the Dutch government found 67 percent of HIV-positive men aged 30 and younger had been infected by a steady partner.

Research also indicates significantly higher levels of violence in homosexual and lesbian relationships compared to traditional married relationships:

• In 1991 the Journal of Social Service Research published a survey of 1,099 lesbians in which slightly more than half of the lesbians said they had been abused by a female lover/partner. The survey noted that “the most frequently indicated forms of abuse were verbal/emotional/psychological abuse and combined physical-psychological abuse.”

• A survey sponsored by the National Institute of Justice found that same-sex couples reported significantly more violence from their partners than did traditional couples. Noted the report, “Thirty-nine percent of the same-sex cohabitants reported being raped, physically assaulted, and/or stalked by a marital/cohabitating partner at some time in their lifetimes, compared to 21.7 percent of the opposite-sex cohabitants. Among men, the comparable figures are 23.1 percent and 7.4 percent.”

Here's the thing, your Google search will pull up what you want to see, just as mine would pull up what I want to see. It's their biggest selling point, the results are customized based on what you normally click through. All sources you find online will have a left or right tilt, and the data will be interpreted based on the views of the one interpreting it. The true cold hard facts have to be taken per city, since the population level and criminal prosecution have to be taken into account, and not all calls are recorded in detail by the police, so most domestic disputes are often miscounted. In our city no matter what the dispute is, even a small amount of violence, they have to by law take them in, if both partners hit or threaten the other they both go in, even if it isn't a true case of domestic abuse or violence. There are no solid stats on who breaks up most often since gay people don't have marriage yet, at least not widely or long enough to build an accurate model. Until they do have marriage in at least half the states for several years and the divorce rates start, there are no hard facts to base a comparison on. "Dating" doesn't really count, because I have seen plenty of straight couples who are very promiscuous, some even including other partners, swinging is what they call it. There are too many variables so without a solid divorce rate there is nothing to say one way or the other. Sorry, but it's just not possible to get solid facts.

Nope... this study is world wide, and it's crammed with solid facts...  Now gay people can get married AND enjoy lobster! 

I'd suggest spending as much energy proving your assertion as you are trying to spin it.

Technically, it's a form of religion, each of the churches would be capitalized though, like Baptist, Protestant, etc. but the word "christian" is a form of religion meaning "follower of Christ", using the word christ as a name. If there was only one church, one solid belief instead of a core of beliefs then it would be. But it's now like the word pagan, many variations revolving around a core belief. As I said, semantics. Google though is like Chrysler or Microsoft, it's the name of a single entity with no variations on it.
 
 
Homosexuality more dangerous than terrorism in America

By Daniel Jeremiah

Websters dictionary defines danger as exposure or liability to injury, pain, or loss, a synonym of dangerous is risky. While terrorism in America has killed a little over 3,000 people in the continental 48 states in the last 15 years, homosexual behavior has killed over 100,000.

DANGER TO LIFE  While Demography magazine has a high-side estimate that the percentage of Americans who are homosexual is only 4 percent, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control estimates that 60 percent of HIV cases are caused by homosexual behavior. This means that of the 16,000 AIDS deaths per year in America (per The Sunday Times), at least 144,000 people were killed because of homosexual relations in the same 15 year period.

DANGER TO HEALTH  Forty-three percent of white male homosexuals have had sex with 500 or more partners and 28 percent have had one thousand or more sex partners (Bell and Weinberg). Because of this, the rate of infection from various sexually transmitted diseases is huge, such as gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydia, herpes, and HPV.

For example, Dr. Andrew Grulich reported HPV infects over 90 percent of HIV-positive homosexual men and 65 percent of HIV-negative homosexual men.

DANGER TO FINANCES  Recent research says that the average person diagnosed with HIV will accumulate $618,000 in additional hospital bills before death. Most homosexuals do not have that much cash on hand, so innocent Americans are paying that either through higher taxes because of payment default or higher health insurance premiums because of this homosexual lifestyle.

DANGER TO CULTURE  Homosexual relationships break down the traditional family unit of a father and mother at home which is proven to be the best for raising healthy children. Median age of death for homosexuals is 20 years younger than the general population (Paul Cameron, Ph.D.), leaving children without their parents at a much younger age. And wide-spread homosexual behavior would eventually bring the human species to extinction through lack of procreation. So it would be dangerous to the culture to promote homosexuality.

Sorry Pale, but as I said, your sources are pulling up a specific slant with all information interpreted with a very biased angle. I could pull up sources with the exact opposite results that are just as valid and biased.

Hmmm... well, I beg to differ KK. Christianity isn't a form of religion, it IS the religion.

I guess I take offense to someone not capitalizing it because I do the same thing. It's one of the ways I show my opposition to something, i.e. obama. I never capitalize his name either. So, I'll just bite it. It's my own tactic.
 
 
 
Sorry Pale, but as I said, your sources are pulling up a specific slant with all information interpreted with a very biased angle. I could pull up sources with the exact opposite results that are just as valid and biased.
 
No, I don't believe they are KK. Because it's one study after another done by completely different entities over many, many years, and they all come up with the same thing, and I don't believe you can show them wrong. You haven't so far...  

At some point you have to realize that maybe you're wrong, and there's proof to a point that you may have thought different.
 
 
Aah... but there is your proof that they are biased. The results of different studies wouldn't show the same results unless they are looking for those specific results or they are copying the same data from the other studies. As I said, I can find just as many sources saying the exact opposite, all just as credible. But because my searches tend to have more left leaning click through results my Google search will pull up all left leaning sources.

Oh, and just because I don't capitalize something doesn't mean I am against it, though I would concede that perhaps it has a much smaller influence in my life. As for Obama, I don't like him either, he's a moronic American Idol star who just couldn't sing, so he ran for president instead.

Well quit telling me you can and let's see some. I don't think you can find anything that has a shred of scientific credibility, as I have, and could continue to seemingly without end. It's easy to show how destructive the homosexual lifestyle is when.... IT IS.
