Black's Response to 28 Black men Gang rape of 11 year old Texas girl

White America stunned by black response to gang rape of eleven year old

Photo Quanell X. This former crack dealer is a leader of the New Black Panther Party. His group wears paramilitary uniforms and says Allah will bring about the extermination of all white people in the near future.

The actions of the black community in Cleveland, Texas, have been so despicable that even the most liberal black apologists are furious.

As many as 28 black men aged 14-28 gang raped an eleven year old Hispanic girl. They videotaped the assault with multiple cameras. Video and camera stills were found circulating at several majority black public schools, including the Middle School attended by the victim.

Then when police arrested the accused perpetrators, many in the black community defended them. A large rally was even held by the New Black Panther Party, which blamed the victim and white racists. Quanell X, a Black Panther leader, distributed a picture of the eleven year old victim and suggested that she enticed the men into raping her. He called the arrests of the accused perpetrators “racist.”

There's no doubt he has a lawess streak, and that he endorses violence and intimidation to achieve ideological goals. I think an equally good question to ask would be what would Obama's good buddy the Weatherman bomb expert and terrorist Bill Ayers do if by some Kafkaesque turn of events he were to become President.

1. Ship assault weapons to Mexico as part of a Machiavellian plan to implement gun control, even though it leads to innocent loss of life.
2. Bomb Libya into submission even though that country poses no threat to the U.S.
3. Refuse to prosecute black panthers who intimidate whites
4. Remain silent about black flashmob attacks
5. Subject law abiding Americans to inhumane treatment at airports
6. Refuse to enforce immigration laws even though failure to do so wreaks havoc on border states by straining budgets and social services
7. Refuse to control federal spending even though the best economists predict the current course will lead to economic collapse
8. Continue to pursue futile war efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq despite campaign promises to withdraw
9. Explore ways to stifle free speech and increase surveillance of the masses to increase government control
10. Construct a network of FEMA interment camps for purposes of processing dissidents after orchestrating economic collapse and imposing authoritarianism.
11. Spend millions in legal fees to cover up the truth about the past

This is just a partial list. One has to look at the totality of his actions to understand the ominous future if we get 4 more years.
 
 
Is Obama a Terrorist?

If he is, he's not very good at it. Not like Republicans who:

Let Bin Laden go

Brought down the US economy

Are behind thousands of Americans dead from a war we were "tricked" into

Are behind the maiming of tens of thousands of Americans from the same war

Are behind the "wealth redistribution" from the middle class to the top 3%

Are blocking rebuilding the American infrastructure

Are behind the slashing of funding for education

Are behind millions of American jobs being moved to China

al Qaeda can only dream of the damage Republicans have caused this country and the number of Americans killed and wounded from that damage.

Go ahead, call me names, but you can't call me "wrong".

I would like to add on to this well thought out post by Flag here that of course he is a terrorist but whats new? that describes the previous president before him Bush as well.In fact it describes EVERY single president we have had since Kennedy.Our last REAL president we had because unlike the others,he wasnt a puppet for the establishment.Carter was a possible exception as not a terrorist to that as well even though he was a willing puppet for the establihment as well which is why he also stayed alive.

With the exception of funding the Department of Mis-education and killing Bin-Laden for a short-lived boost in ratings, everything you listed is part of the Obama agenda. Thanks for supporting terrorism, Libtard.

Although i agree with 99% of what you both have said, i have to disagree about Carter. He's a very strong anti semite and i think that's as bad as being a terrorist.......

Foreign terrorists are far less concerning than ones that use our money to terrorize in the name of human rights. So I'm not really sure what you are noting.
Especially when the poster never indicated support for a foreign terrorist. But instead pointed to the fact that Libya posed no imminent threat to the USA. Making our "intervention" not only built on lies, but also unconstitutional and internationally unlawful.

You're right in every aspect BUT stating there will never be another black president. His problems are NOT because he's black, it's because he thought he could be president and the people backing him put him there for God knows why! He's a failure, but NOT because he's black (or half-black).

exactly.thats what i was saying earlier.its a copout to do the pale rider thing and blame everything On Obama when he is no different than any president we have had since nov
22nd 1963. Doesnt matter WHO is in office.everyone that gets in is always worse than the previous one.Both parties -the demopublicans and reprocrats,are corrupt and have the same agenda.

This country has made quite a few mistakes in it's past and trying to cobble them into the sensibility of today's thinking, in terms of right and wrong, is pretty naive. It's easy to stand back and go..oh..quashing that communist leader in Iran was a bad thing..but back then the United States was extremely fearful of spreading communism. And it seemed one country after another was going in that direction. History makes us all neat little umpires but being "in the moment" is another story entirely.

What is clear about Gaddafi is that he authored an attack on American civilians. And what should be clear to all Americans is, aside from removing conditions that create terrorism, one must remove the terrorists as well.
 
 
Except I'm not umpiring history. I'm umpiring "in the moment". The UN resolution for a no-fly zone over Libya does not give way for bombing the country, including civilians on the ground. Or a regime change as it has so morphed into being.
That is the part that is clear.
Back to the original topic, the United States, as I posted in this thread previously, makes its own bed when it comes to foreign entanglements. We are the BIGGEST terrorists out there hands down. The point with Gaddafi; pot, meet kettle.

No, sorry; don't see it. We have a code of conduct, they don't.
 
 
What are you blathering about?
If you have two good eyes and still cant see, I highly doubt further explanation can help you here.

but i'll give it a spin anyhow.

Our
"code of conduct" as you put it, in this scenario has been abandoned. Bombing civilians really does not equate to a human rights intervention..

What is our code of conduct then? Do what ever we please to meet our end goals, above and beyond the rule of law?
