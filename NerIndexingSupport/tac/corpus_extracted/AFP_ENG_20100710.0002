A Bosnian Serb party on Saturday decorated a former Bosnian Serb wartime leader
ahead of the 15th anniversary of a massacre for which he is standing trial, a
news agency reported.

The opposition Serb Democratic Party (SDS) decorated Radovan Karadzic at a
ceremony marking its 20th anniversary, said FENA news agency.

Karadzic and his key ally Momcilo Krajisnik, the wartime leader of the Bosnian
Serb assembly, founded the SDS before Yugoslavia was breaking up amid sectarian
violence in the early 1990s.

Karadzic is currently standing trial before the International Criminal Tribunal
for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague for his role in the 1992-1995 war
in Bosnia, notably the July 1995 massacre of Muslims in the town of Srebrenica.

The ICTY has sentenced Krajisnik to 20 years in prison for war crimes committed
against non-Serbs during the war.

The decorations were handed over to Karadzic's wife Ljiljana Zelen-Karadzic and
Krajisnik's brother Mirko Krajisnik on the eve of the commemoration of the
Srebrenica massacre in which 8,000 Muslim men and boys were killed by Bosnian
Serb forces after they captured the UN-protected enclave in eastern Bosnia.

The massacre was the worst such atrocity in Europe since World War II and is
considered genocide by the ICTY and the UN's top court, the International Court
of Justice.

However, Bosnian Serbs persistantly deny the scale of the massacre, while
Karadzic and fugitive wartime military chief Ratko Mladic, also indicted for
genocide, are still considered heroes by many.

Karadzic was arrested in Belgrade in 2008, while Mladic is still at large.

The 1992-95 inter-ethnic war in Bosnia left some 100,000 people dead.
