Portland, Maine (CNN) -- Following a trio of embarrassing losses, Mitt Romney will do something he has not done this election cycle while Ron Paul hopes for his first win.

On Saturday, hours before Maine's Republican Party announces results of its caucuses, Romney will visit caucus sites on voting day -- something he has not done in previous contests this cycle.

Meanwhile, Paul hopes to break his losing streak, having gone 0-for-8 in the previous races to date.

The moves come four days after rival Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum swept contests in Missouri, Minnesota and Colorado. Santorum and Newt Gingrich are not actively competing in the contest.

"The race is going to come down to Paul or Romney, just because the other guys haven't really been here and been involved," Maine GOP Chairman Charlie Webster said.

"Maine is an important state because it's a swing state," Maine Sen. Susan Collins said.

"Candidates who campaign here are frequently rewarded with votes. People in Maine want to get to know the people who represent them."

No other candidate except Paul recently campaigned in Maine. But that changed Friday, when Romney held a town hall in Portland -- his first visit to the Pine Tree state this entire election cycle.

That instantly set up a two-man contest between New England's current favorite political son and the Texas congressman Paul, who has a loyal libertarian following.

The two men hardly blast each other on the campaign trail. Yet Romney's 11th-hour move appeared to be an effort to further Paul's losing streak and rebound from an embarrassing shutout on Tuesday and avoid a headline of another caucus loss.

"We hope to do as well as possible in Maine," Romney spokesman Ryan Williams said.

If Ron Paul wins Maine I will forever wipe it from my list of possible places to live.

Though the frequent monster attacks are another reason.
 
 
You'd rather have them vote for the other crazy guys?
 
 
Frothys doing pretty well in Michigan.
 
 
So if Newt drops out, will Santorum get most of his former supporters? That could mean real trouble for Romney.
 
 
Santorum comes from behind. You knew it was going to happen.
 
 
The GOP had better hope Santorum doesn't win the nomination. They might wind up losing both houses as well as the presidency. He can't even win his state. He is a joke to most of the nation. If the nominating process panders to party extremists, the the party is dead meat in the general election. It happened with McGovern. That is a lesson that neither party should forget.

A data point for predestination, I suppose.

I've heard people argue that Santorum is exactly what the GOP needs because of the McGovern example, to purge the crazy.
 
 
It appears that Romney now has his own "Google problem". You can google it.  
 
 
Why would anyone ever get nervous about the possibility of not being elected to the position of Number One Whipping Boy?

Don't tell me, let me guess. That would be someone who likes the idea of working 16-hour days and being prematurely aged an extra ten years or so.

Oh well. I guess it's worth it to get to live in the big house and ride on the helicopter and the plane.

Oddly enough, Santorum has been leading in polls here in Michigan. This is Mitt's home state:

Even worse for Romney is that Santorum is also leading in Michigan, which, along with Arizona, votes next, on Feb. 28. Santorum is skipping Arizona because the large Mormon population there is going to vote for Romney no matter what, but he is actively campaigning in Michigan, despite that being Romney's home state.

 
Just saw a ad for Mitt last night all about his growing up here. Nice, but if he is going to win in Michigan the negative ads needs to hit here soon. So far I have only seen ads against Gingrich. None targeting Santorum yet.

Edited to add: One of the reasons Mitt has to go negative here is because of his stand on the auto industry bailouts. He needs a distraction because he opposed them and needs people to forget they started under Bush.

That's a thought. However, I'm not sure that things would play out the same. McGovern Democrats came right back to the Democratic party. Would the Tea Party come right back to the Republicans? Would they split off? Would they create the same mess next election?
 
 
 
"Is your opinion of Mitt Romney favorable, not favorable, undecided, or haven't you heard enough about Mitt Romney yet to have an opinion?"

In all, 40% of Americans have an unfavorable view of Romney -- the worst he's done in five years of polling -- while 26% have a favorable view. (By comparison, Obama's fav/unfav rating is 45/41.) A new  CNN poll  also shows Romney's favorability numbers tumbling.

What the GOP needs desperately is a trend of losing. That will slap them upside the head really quick. So long as they can win on social issues BS they will use it.
 
 
Yeah, many Republican voters don't agree social issues are 'bs'.

Exactly. Hence the problem. Just like the KKK hasn't realized that racial animus is no longer a winning issue those voters don't realize that society is progressing beyond them. Most people want and use contraception. The trend toward tolerance of gays and lesbians is moving in a singular direction. The notion that the sanctity of life is more about a mass of cells than a living, thinking breathing human being is growing. The voters you talk about are incapable of simply looking at the culture around them and figuring out that they lost. The culture war is over. Hell, it was over two decades ago.

Dang, too late to change my vote. Mailed it yesterday.

When the GOP pulls its head out, and washes it off, I'll have to see what's left and decide if I can support it. I rather hope the GOP comes around to being the GOP of Eisenhower again, so that I actually have to CHOOSE.

Four. The last forty years conservative ideology has just been a reaction to the rapid social change of the Sixties and the technology-driven upheavals that followed. Hell, it's even in the name- they are trying to "conserve" a world, their world, that simply does not exist anymore.

It's why the entrenched PTB are trying to wrangle control over the internet now "by any means necessary".

I wouldn't say many, I'd say most agree social issues aren't 'bs'.
 
 
 
... they are trying to "conserve" a world, their world, that simply does not exist anymore.

...

 
Serious question; Did it EVER exist?

Republican "social issues" are a used up, scrawny, useless rooster kicking a gas pump to try and bring back the glory of his Jurassic ancestors.

Unlikely.

It's pretty clear my predictions this cycle have been poor, but this has been one crazy primary season. If I were to make a guess I'd say that Romney's strength, the economy, isn't working as well with the nation on an upturn, so the base is falling back to their "moral" platform with Santorum.

I also fear that no matter the candidate the race will be close with so much of the country bitterly partisan that the R and D are the only things they are actually voting for.

If it's Santorum I really don't think it will be close. Too many independents and moderates won't care for his extremism. JMO.

In am told that there are some stories being held in abeyance until he is the clear nominee, if that happens, which will pretty much sink Santorum's entire career. We'll see if that rumor pans out.

Some parts. There was a time when public school started each day with a Christian prayer. There was a time when there was no Medicare or Social Security. There was a time when women and minorities were not allowed to vote. There was a time when there were not so many Hispanics in our society. There was a time when you could hit or even beat your own children without fear of repercussion.

Other parts are pure fantasy. There has always been teenage pregnancy (though it used to be hushed up.) There has never been a time when all kids got a good education in our public schools. There has never been a time when all the young men cheerfully went off to war. There has never been a time where there weren't homosexuals. (Again. Hushed up.) There has never been a time when everybody had enough to eat.

For some Conservatives, the past is a jumble of Norman Rockwell paintings.

You are told?

It bugs me that journalists would be sitting on information, thinking heh-heh-heh just wait, if those suckers nominate Santorum, we'll show 'em! Why waste all that dirt on a mere senator - let's wait till he's the GOP nominee.

And if he's not? The stories never get told?

Oh, I  romney  every day. My kitten cries at the door when I'm in the bathroom until I let him in. I don't know if I'm more terrified that he may be gay, or that he's looking for something new to use as a cat toy.
 
 
 
... There has always been teenage pregnancy (though it used to be hushed up.)...

 
Let me tell you a story;

I went to Catholic School for most of my upbringing. There was a girl who was in my class for a few months in the 5th grade and then not when classes resumed the next year, and I thought no more of it.

One day, when I was in high school, I was filling coolers in our tavern, and she comes in with the grandparents she lived with, and I started to talk to her and we wandered outside to talk not around parents. And she told me that she was pregnant and was being sent away to have the baby. This shocked me, and I asked my mother about that and she said that it was, or used to be, very common to send unwed pregnant teenage girls to relatives in the country or to homes for such girls to avoid the embarrassment to the family.

I wonder to this day what happened to her, but yes, it used to be hushed up big time.

Maybe, maybe not. Ultimately a reporter needs to look at the impact the story will have. If Santorum is NOT about to be the GOP nominee, the story might not be ethical to reveal. Some stories can have cruel effects on people they are not about, for example.

Yeah, but at least he's somewhat likeable. Unlike robo Mitt who's doing his best to destroy even the small shreds of popularity he once had.

Teenage pregnancy rates in the US are a lot lower than they used to be by the way.

O tempera o mores.

That sounds like a convenient rationalization. He's a U.S. senator. If the truth about him hurts someone, oh well. He shouldn't have done it. Whatever it was. Don't shoot the messenger, and all.

It's "a story" if he's the nominee, but only then. I can kind of see it, except, where then is the line that says, Oh, senators can do behavior X, no big deal. But if a presidential nominee does it, that's news.

In fact Santorum probably has more influence as a senator than he would as a nominee. There's no reason it would be more ethical to release the info a few months from now. But it would help a media outlet manufacture some pious agony about the moral issues involved, and what a tough decision it was to run the story, etc.

I'm a journalist, I'd rather we didn't play these games.
 
 
The most recent numbers I've read indicate that teen pregnancy rates in the US are at their lowest levels in 40 years, while teen birth rates are at their lowest rates ever.

Teen pregnancy makes a certain amount of sense IMO.

But, to bring the issue back to Romney: Why do Mormon women stop having babies at 35?

Isn't that enough?

Oops, he's not a current officeholder. So, the story/not a story calculus changes some... My bad Ben

That's because of that evil abortion and birth control. Get this country back to the good old days when sex meant babies. We'll get that teenage pregnancy rate back up to where it ought to be.

Oh, wait...
 
 
 
... Get this country back to the good old days when sex meant babies. We'll get that teenage pregnancy rate back up to where it ought to be.

 
In a lot of ways I think it's healthier for older teenagers to give birth than it is for older women of lower fertility with a higher risk of complications. But, that means the young woman's ability to get an education or good job are restricted. In families with good social support, I've seen teen moms do terrific.
 
 
It is hilarious to watch Romney twist in the wind in Michigan, where he said "sod off" to the automobile industry.

Mitt thinks corporations are people. And sometimes you have to murder them.

Under such blatant socialists as Eisenhower? Of course not!

Also the good old shotgun wedding. But married teen pregnancy doesn't count for some reason.
