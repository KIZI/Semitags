The 1812 war was between the US and the British. Canada as a government didn't exist until 1867. Yet Canadians continue to claim that they beat America, when in reality the US never fought "Canada" and has more of right to claim victory than the British (because the US won the last major battle and ended British impressment, which was what started the war in the first place). So how could Canada have participated in the 1812 war, when at that time "Canada" was only known as a region of North America? It seems to me Canadians are looking for something to get patriotic about, but facts are facts. Is there nothing else Canadians can use for patriotism besides this fiction that's based on nothing but historically false mythology?

Here's an article from the March 2012 issue of the Canadian magazine Walrus titled "That Time We Beat the Americans".

Americans didn't win the war of independence either they would have technically been British until the war was over.

The war of 1812 was over British impressment or kidnapping of US merchant sailors. I think the US has more of a right to claim victory because we achieved everything we intended and won the battle of new orleans, which was the last major battle.

My main confusion is why are Canadians using a war that they never fought for their on patriotic purposes.

This is like if the US took the British and French 7 Years war and annually celebrated a victory for the US over the British, when in reality the British were more victorious over the French and the US wasn't even a country when it occurred.

Noone won the war. New Orleans was one of the most pointless battles in history. it was only fought because of the time delay in getting news of the peace treaty. land borders hardly changed, America wanted Canada and they never achieved that. And the whole affair was just a sideshow for the Empire as they had bigger fish to fry with Napoleon. if there had been no war in Europe the US would of been utterly crushed.

That doesn't make any sense. Th US declared independence in 1776 and achieve it in 1781. So are you saying all revolutionary wars weren't won by the rebels but by the country being rebelled against?
 
 
This is America's response to their claims

The purpose of the 1812 war (from the American perspective) was NOT to take over the region Canada. It was to stop British impressment of US sailors and gain respect. This was achieved therefore the US has more of a right to claim victory.

Canada didn't exist as a government entity until 1867, so why are they celebrating something that they never participated in? Inferiority Complex?

Yes. How would you feel if you were Canada and everybody referred to you as "America Two" and "America's Hat" and "Diet America"?

The impressment issue is debatable, because the British were trying to get Royal Navy deserters back, while the Americans said that once they were in America the deserters were naturalised American citizens. Besides, Britain only needed to use impressment so it would have enough sailors to fight Napoleon, and by the time the war was over he had already been defeated.

In the end, neither Britain nor America achieved their aims, but both managed to repel the others invasion of their territory and so both sides can claim victory. The only people who really lost were Britain's Indian allies, who lost the former's protection.

I think the reason Canada celebrates it as their victory is because for the first two years any potential British reinforcements were fighting in Europe, so the majority of forces opposing the American invasion were local Canadian militias.

There are many countries around the world that are in a similar situation in regards to one country have a bigger culture and influence than the other. New Zealand is overshadowed by Australia. But why not be patriotic with the facts on your side?

It seems Canadians aren't happy with their history and achievements so they resort to fiction.

If the US had used impressment against the British or any other country there would have been automatic war. The British, who were then one of world's superpowers, was trying to bully the young United States.

America did achieve its aim to stop British impressment and gain respect. So the US has more of a right to claim victory. Britain was a superpower and for a young and weak country to go toe to toe with the stronger country will always be chalked as a victory for the smaller country.

But those local militia were British not Canadian because it was a British territory.

Oh, I see, an American is complaining about Canadians.

The point is is that it wasn't the war that stopped impressment, it was simply the fact that it was no longer needed. Impressment would have stopped anyway regardless of whether or not America declared war. When you discount that America had neither gained nor lost anything by the end.

As for the nationality, the American Declaration of Independence wasn't signed until more than a year after the revolution began, and wasn't recognised until seven years after that. Would you then argue that Americans have no right to be proud of anything that happened before, because until 1776 they too were British?

Many wars end for reasons different from what started them. But the 1812 war stopped future impressment and future bullying from Britain. Like I said, name a country at that time that would've allow impressment of their sailors?

Your comments make no sense and ignore the universal understanding of a revolution. If the rebels succeed in their revolution, then they are no longer the nationality of the country they rebelled against and are historically considered a new nationality during and after the revolution.

The US revolution doesn't relate to Canada and the 1812 war. Canada can make no claim to the 1812 war because they weren't a government entity until 1867, nor were they in limbo of becoming a country when that war took place. The same way the US can't claim the 7 years war between the British and French.

In History lessons I learn how to determine how reliable a source is by remembering the PACT:

Purpose
Author
Context
Tone

And for your OP it goes:

Purpose - To have a go at Canadians and make America seem great

Author - An American which means the source will contain bias which favours ideas which show America in a positive light and other countries in a bad way

Context - 2012, approximately 200 years after the "War of 1812" which means a lot of evidence will have been lost and some information may have become obscured during that time period + you are posting on a student forum comprised mostly of 14-21 year old who are probably more impressionable than the general population

Tone - Heavily biased, doesn't show the other side of the argument at all
 
 
All i know is when i was visiting family in Canada, everyone was talking about "the war of 1812". I never heard anyone say "we won the war" or any variation of that statement. If anything it was that the British defeated the Americans. Not knowing to much about the "war" I can't offer my opinion on who won but the claim that Canada are claiming victory for themselves seems obsolete to me after I spent a reasonable period of time in Canada and listening to peoples views on the "war".

The problem with your whole "know it all" lecture is that I didn't started this thread to debate over sources, but to have a opinionated discussion, one over (in my opinion) obvious facts. But I even presented both sides of the argument in the OP while asserting my postion on the side of facts - A video that speaks for the American side and an article that speaks for the Canadian side. But you could even do your own independent search and pull your own sources. The truth of the matter is Canadians are rewriting history and it baffles me.

Plus. I can do the same silly PACT with you comments so far:

Purpose - To one up an American and try to change the subject to "American's think they're great", when it's actually about Canadians rewriting the History of the 1812 war. All while trying to discredit the argument solely because it came from a person who is from a country that's related to the argument. The logic of this makes no sense because then all British accounts of British history should be discredited as well.

Author - A Briton, which means the source will be bias and more likely on the side of the Canadians because they are still part of the commonwealth and would rather go with the story that Britain and Canada defeated the Americans, than what actually occurred based on historical facts.

Context - 2012, roughly 2 centuries after the war of 1812, which means more historically analysis from both sides via books, documentaries, etc. are available giving a more accurate picture of what took place.

Tone - Smugly biased, which could be clearly seen when comments like "make America seem great" were made. While ignoring the fact that the other side of the argument was presented when the article from Canadian magazine Walrus was linked.

Yes Canada did participate it was part of the British empire and the British empire fought the war. Think about what you are saying for a moment, if scotland left the UK then according to you the people who live there would no longer be able to claim their country defeated germany in 2 world wars or napoleon? Similarly if the UK split up into its different nations none of them would be able to claim any credit for victory? Thats just stupid... surely you must see that Canada fought and whether it was called canada or not is irrelevant?

As for who won the war, america failed to capture a completely indefensible province of the British empire that even an army of frenchmen should have been able to seize. The united states was blockaded and new england even betrayed the USA by supplying the British! You are claiming victory because Britain failed to absolutely beat the crap out of you, even though it managed to prevent the USA achieving any of its objectives. I mean the peace treaty didn't even mention impressment at all, the only reason it stopped is that we won the war against the french. Also we retained the right to keep american ships off the trade routes that the UK wanted for itself. The USA failed to achieve anything, and since the USA was the aggressor and Britain was just aiming for the status quo to be restored that makes Britain and its empire including Canada the winners.

It does if almost every Canadian says the same thing. I bet if you polled the Canadian public, they'd say Canada defeated America in the 1812 war, when that's factually incorrect. That article is a reflection of the Canadian mythology of the 1812 war. Why do they hold onto this war as if they were involved? Is their history that boring that they have to use fiction? I think it's because Canadians are looking for their own "American Revolution" or "French Revolution" moment. While America and France use historical facts, Canada uses myth.

You said it your self the "British Empire fought the war". "Canada" was not a government entity when the 1812 war took place. Before the US revolution, the American colonist fought during the 7 years war, so should the United States media now claim ownership of that war with ridiculous headlines like "That Time We Beat the French"?

Your Scotland example isn't equivalent to this Canada and 1812 war matter because Canada was never a sovereign country that later joined the United Kingdom.

The aim of the the US during the 1812 war was never to capture any part of Canada region. It was to force the British to stop the impressment of US sailors and to gain respect from the British who were bullying the young and weak US. The US achieved all of it's objectives so it has the right to claim victory.

You've got it completely wrong, the British were the aggressors, name one country that would have sat by and allowed another country to regularly kidnapp their citizens? The british were bullying the US and forced the US to take action.
 
 
 
Your comments make no sense and ignore the universal understanding of a revolution. If the rebels succeed in their revolution, then they are no longer the nationality of the country they rebelled against and are historically considered a new nationality during and after the revolution.

Canada can make no claim to the 1812 war because they weren't a government entity until 1867, nor were they in limbo of becoming a country when that war took place. The same way the US can't claim the 7 years war between the British and French.

 

Before 1776 it wasn't a fight for independence, it was a fight for the colonists fundamental rights to be recognised. The majority of the Founding Fathers still favoured reconciliation with Britain, and it was only when George III declared them rebels that popular opinion turned against anything British. Hence both sides at the battles of Lexington and Concord considered themselves British subjects, and so according to your argument it's Britain who should get the credit for the colonial victory.
 
 
 
has more of right to claim victory than the British (because the US won the last major battle and ended British impressment, which was what started the war in the first place).

 

is that a fact? so the burning of washington escaped your notice did it?
also do you know the meaning of the phrase 'status quo ante bellum'? i suggest you look it up.

That may be true, but what was Britain's aim? To prevent the US taking its land, once this was achieved they could sue for peace. The British/Canadian forces repelled the US forces and then counter-invaded, burning the White House to the ground. Before the peace treaty was signed, Britain/Canada had won two thirds of all the battles and lost about 10 thousand fewer men (all this despite keeping the bulk of its army back in Europe). That's really not much of a victory for the US.

Both sides achieved their main aim (Britain/Canada = saving their land; US = ending impressment & gaining respect), and failed on their minor aim (US = taking Canadian land; Britain = continuing impressment). Neither side really had a reason to continue, the US had made its point that it could cause the British Empire problems if it was not properly respected, but in more practical terms it had lost more territory in the northern US than it had gained in Canada; Britain was in the middle of the much bigger and bloodier War of the Sixth Coalition, a grudge match, involving twice as many British troops as it had in America, and the focal point of the main British politicians and generals, who thus couldn't be dealing also with a distraction in America. I know it seems weird given the US's dominant position as a superpower in world affairs and economics today, but in 1812-1815 Britain had bigger fish to fry, and they didn't come any bigger than France and Napoleon. Both sides kept their dignity and saw the sense in peace, and it was thus a tie.
 
 
Americans are brainwashed to be patriotic to a fault, so any valid argument is just going to be lost on him. Keep thinking America is the best country in the world, buddy

HAHAHAHA. The canadians are so insecure that they actually have to make up a war they won? lol. It saddens me that Canada has sunk to this. I think canadian socialism is partially to blame. I really feel sorry for canadians. They are loosing the battle against socialism and oppression.

I agree with only half of what you've said. The US didn't have a minor objective, the main objective was to attack some part of the British Empire as a matter of national defense because the British weren't respecting US sovereignty by impressment of US sailors. If the US had not retaliated and allowed impressment, then the US would be putting it's sovereignty in jeopardy, basically sending a message to other nations that the US is a pushover country ripe for invasion.

So because the US achieved it's aim of ending impressment and gaining respect, while the British didn't achieve their aim which was to continue what they were doing originally including bullying and impressment, I think the US has more of a right to claim victory.

Wow. You should really get the King of Bias Award. You've already made up your mind that everything I'm saying should be discredited just because I'm American.

This thread is focusing on historical facts versus mythology in relationship to the 1812 war and you bring up "Americans are brainwashed" and "Keep thinking America is the best country in the world" out of the blue. Is there something that's weighing over you Canadians? Does this have to do with an inferiority complex?

Haha yes, because whenever Canadians say anything negative about the States, that's what it boils down to.  

Actually, us Canadians are taught in school that neither the USA or Canada won the War of 1812; it says so right in our textbooks. You Americans are taught that you won it, so I think that says it all.

And your "Canada couldn't have won the War of 1812 because it didn't even exist" argument is completely ridiculous and invalid. While we were still under British rule, there were the provinces of Upper and Lower Canada, which would later become Ontario and Quebec.

But those local militia were British not Canadian because it was a British territory.

 

The US did not fight the full might of the British Empire, Britain was busy fighting Nappy. What the US fought was the militarily weaker Canadian colonies. So the weaker side was infact the Canadians.
 
 
 
The US didn't have a minor objective, the main objective was to attack some part of the British Empire as a matter of national defense because the British weren't respecting US sovereignty by impressment of US sailors.

 

And in the eyes of the United Kingdom, the United States wasn't respecting British sovereignty by harbouring and offering citizenship to British fugitives and deserters.

 
If the US had not retaliated and allowed impressment, then the US would be putting it's sovereignty in jeopardy, basically sending a message to other nations that the US is a pushover country ripe for invasion.

So because the US achieved it's aim of ending impressment and gaining respect, while the British didn't achieve their aim which was to continue what they were doing originally including bullying and impressment, I think the US has more of a right to claim victory.

 

The United States didn't achieve it's aim of ending impressment; The Admiralty ended the policy a few days before the war begun. Of course, due to slow communication, America couldn't have known this. Due to the war, Britain restarted the policy, however once more ended it in 1814, after the first defeat of Napoleon. American wishes never once entered into the factor. This is shown by the fact that Britain reserved the right to re-introduce impressment at it's own prerogative. The United States attempted to demand that the issues of impressment and blockades be written into the Treaty of Ghent, but they ultimately dropped those issues. How on Earth is that acheiving your goal?

The hardline facts are these: No territory changed hands. America failed to deal with the issues of impressment and the blockade, the primary reasons for entering the war. Britain might not have won the war, but America certainly lost.
 
 
 
Haha yes, because whenever Canadians say anything negative about the States, that's what it boils down to.

The fact that you jumped straight to something negative and off topic about the US speaks volumes about you Canadians and your inferiority complex.

You've just proved my point and you didn't even realize it. Look at the way you were taught to describe the 1812 war - "neither USA or Canada won". Canada did not exist when the war took place. The US fought the British empire. The government of Canada did not sign a peace treaty with the US. The British signed it. Canada has nothing to do with the war of 1812, other then some part of the war was fought in that region.

Canada as a government entity did not exist during the 1812 war, I know you Canadians are looking for something to be proud of, but at least find something that's based on facts not mythology.
 
 
 
The US did not fight the full might of the British Empire, Britain was busy fighting Nappy. What the US fought was the militarily weaker Canadian colonies. So the weaker side was infact the Canadians.

 

That's an excuse after the fact. An American excuse would be: Britain did not fight the full might of the US because America was a young country.

They were British colonies in the region known as Canada. Canada as a government entity did not exist until 1867.
 
 
 
And in the eyes of the United Kingdom, the United States wasn't respecting British sovereignty by harbouring and offering citizenship to British fugitives and deserters.

 

That doesn't make any sense, British sovereignty has nothing to do with it. If someone leaves one country for another seeking refuge, they become an immigrant or refugee. Unless there's a pior agreement between the two countries, then the person is not returned.

 
The United States didn't achieve it's aim of ending impressment; The Admiralty ended the policy a few days before the war begun. Of course, due to slow communication, America couldn't have known this. Due to the war, Britain restarted the policy, however once more ended it in 1814, after the first defeat of Napoleon. American wishes never once entered into the factor. This is shown by the fact that Britain reserved the right to re-introduce impressment at it's own prerogative. The United States attempted to demand that the issues of impressment and blockades be written into the Treaty of Ghent, but they ultimately dropped those issues. How on Earth is that acheiving your goal?

The hardline facts are these: No territory changed hands. America failed to deal with the issues of impressment and the blockade, the primary reasons for entering the war. Britain might not have won the war, but America certainly lost.

 

Like a said before, many wars start and end for different reasons. Fact of the matter is the US was provoked because its sovereignty was threatened and had no choice but to take action or risk becoming a pushover. When the war finally ended, everything the US aimed for was achieved. Impressment stopped. It doesn't matter why it stopped, but it stopped. Those issues were dropped because they weren't of concern any longer.

The weren't immigrants or refugees, they were criminals and deserters to which the US government was giving assylum. At the time, British law did not allow it's citizens to give up citizenship. In the eyes of the UK, if you were born British, you die British. For the American government to harbour these people was a direct attack on the sovereignty of the British crown over its subjects.

Of course it matters why it was stopped. For America's military campaign to have been a success, American military or political action must have been why Britain gave up impressment. It wasn't. At the end of the war, the British Admiralty reserved the right to re-introduce the policy at it's own prerogative. Britain reserved the right to blockade the high seas at it's own prerogative. These were the two key issues America went to war for, and at the end of the conflict it had resolved neither. The only person who achieved all their objectives was the United Kingdom; the defence of Canada and status quo in North America.

What are you on about? You tried to paint the US as the underdogs in the post I quoted. I am telling you that the Canadians the US fought were infact the underdogs.

Yes we know Canada didn't exist as a sovereign nation, but the people that would later make up the state of Canada did. These are the people that fought the US.

And yes you can feel proud about the 7 years war if it helps you sleep at night. Honestly, no one gives a crap about pointless technicalities like these.

The 1812 war was between the US and the British. Canada as a government didn't exist until 1867. Yet Canadians continue to claim that they beat America, when in reality the US never fought "Canada" and has more of right to claim victory than the British (because the US won the last major battle and ended British impressment, which was what started the war in the first place). So how could Canada have participated in the 1812 war, when at that time "Canada" was only known as a region of North America? It seems to me Canadians are looking for something to get patriotic about, but facts are facts. Is there nothing else Canadians can use for patriotism besides this fiction that's based on nothing but historically false mythology?

Here's an article from the March 2012 issue of the Canadian magazine Walrus titled "That Time We Beat the Americans".

 http://walrusmagazine.com/article.ph...-the-americans 

 

Just like the rebellious American colonies are claiming the history prior to secession from the British Crown?

I think you've misunderstood the term 'revisionist history' a bit.

Canadians have 'claim' to any history that occurs in their country, especially considering they are part of the Commonwealth (They still hold the Queen as head of state).
 
 
I think Canada can claim to have been involved in that war. The British North American colonies may not have been called Canada at the time, but modern Canada is clearly the continuation of those colonies.

Why do they celebrate Thanksgiving in the USA? The story of Thanksgiving predates the USA, yet I'm sure many Americans consider it to be a defining part of America's history.

 
Yes. How would you feel if you were Canada and everybody referred to you as "America Two" and "America's Hat" and "Diet America"?

 

Sometimes I like to think of the USA as "Canada's toilet"  
 
 
 
You said it your self the "British Empire fought the war". "Canada" was not a government entity when the 1812 war took place. Before the US revolution, the American colonist fought during the 7 years war, so should the United States media now claim ownership of that war with ridiculous headlines like "That Time We Beat the French"?

Your Scotland example isn't equivalent to this Canada and 1812 war matter because Canada was never a sovereign country that later joined the United Kingdom.

The aim of the the US during the 1812 war was never to capture any part of Canada region. It was to force the British to stop the impressment of US sailors and to gain respect from the British who were bullying the young and weak US. The US achieved all of it's objectives so it has the right to claim victory.

You've got it completely wrong, the British were the aggressors, name one country that would have sat by and allowed another country to regularly kidnapp their citizens? The british were bullying the US and forced the US to take action.

 

Canada fought in the war. It does not matter whether it was called canada or had its own government, it fought in the war. Canadian militia defeated US armies. I don't know why you can't understand this. My scotland example is exactly the same as this one, canada was in the British empire and scotland is in the UK. Thats the same thing. All parts of a nation or empire can claim that they were part of the victory of that nation or empire even if they later secede from it. You cannot just rewrite history and say "yeah canada had nothing to do with the war, nothing happened in north america other than us fighting some British people who have since dropped off the face of the earth and been replaced by these people called canadians".

Well the USA failed to achieve its objectives. Impressment was stopped because napoleon was defeated, you do understand that right? America declaring war had no effect at all. Everyone accepts this. It is also obvious because the peace treaty that ended the war did not mention impressment, the UK would have continued with this had the war with france continued. Every american attack was defeated and your capital city pillaged and burnt. Anyone with any intelligence would see that as a defeat. Essentially you faced a very weak British force as most of the British army was busy in europe, had the USA continued the war after napoleon had been defeated then it would have been crushed, completely and utterly crushed. It sued for peace because it could see what was coming.

Stop saying your country was young and weak, I don't know what point you are trying to make but it just sounds stupid. Germany was a young country of 43 years when it took on most of the world in ww1, your country was 31 years old when it took on a single over stretched power that was fighting the biggest war it had ever engaged in.
 
 
 
If the war started because of British bullying and impressment of US sailors, and after the war British bullying and impressment ended, wouldn't you say the US achieved their objective, and therefore has more of a right to claim victory?

 

that is but one of the claimed origins of the war others have said the embargo on american good to france was a cause, support of the indians and incidents such as the Chesapeake affair and the subsequent embargo, some have also argued that american expansionism was a cause as well... so depending what you believe to be the cause besides didnt press ganging continue until the defeat of Napoleon in 1814 at which point it was considered superfluous anyway?
 
 
Probably not the first country that has tried to rewrite history, or deny a part of their past.
 
 
 
Haha yes, because whenever Canadians say anything negative about the States, that's what it boils down to.  

Actually, us Canadians are taught in school that neither the USA or Canada won the War of 1812; it says so right in our textbooks. You Americans are taught that you won it, so I think that says it all.

And your &quot;Canada couldn't have won the War of 1812 because it didn't even exist&quot; argument is completely ridiculous and invalid. While we were still under British rule, there were the provinces of Upper and Lower Canada, which would later become Ontario and Quebec.

 

I think overall the US did win in its aims actually. The war of 1812, for better or for worse prevented the native Americans from establishing their own empire; the US successfully defended her territory from british invasion in New York, New Orleans and Baltimore. The US also managed to seize places like Ontario. I think the US did win, we managed to defend our sovereign territory.

 
...

 

No, britain failed in its invasion of the USA and its attempts to establish an indian empire to strangle the USA.
 
 
 
I think overall the US did win in its aims actually. The war of 1812, for better or for worse prevented the native Americans from establishing their own empire;

 

And failed to gain any kind of concession regarding impressment or the blockade. I thought Americans were ambitious, yet here you are claiming that one out of three constitutes a victory?

 
the US successfully defended her territory from british invasion in New York, New Orleans and Baltimore.

 

Only after numerous failed invasions of Canada.

 
The US also managed to seize places like Ontario.

 

So? The British burned down the White House. Neither actions had any effect on the Treaty of Ghent.

 
I think the US did win, we managed to defend our sovereign territory.

 

Considering the fact that the United States was the aggressor nation, what you say is irrelevant. The UK had no intention of impeding your 'sovereign territory'. The British invasion of the US was a tactical move as a means of waging war, not a strategic attempt at annexation. By your very own logic you admit that the UK won, since it successfully defended British North America.

 
No, britain failed in its invasion of the USA and its attempts to establish an indian empire to strangle the USA.

 

And the United States failed in it's invasion of Canada, it failed to gain concessions regarding impressment or the blockade and it suffered more casualties despite facing pretty much Britain's reserve team.
 
 
 
And failed to gain any kind of concession regarding impressment or the blockade. I thought Americans were ambitious, yet here you are claiming that one out of three constitutes a victory?

 

The US managed to defend its territory, force the british back with their tails between their legs and managed to prevent the rise of the native americans. Yes, i'd say the US succeeded in its aims.

 
Only after numerous failed invasions of Canada.
 

lol, the US didn't want to take canada, it wanted to be left to its own devices, which the british didn't seem to want, as they kept getting involved in the internal affairs of the US.

 
So? The British burned down the White House. Neither actions had any effect on the Treaty of Ghent.
 

Britain's attempt to break democracy and freedom, which threatened your empire.

The US wasn't the aggressor nation, it was britain who tried to capture Americans (both born and naturalized) and force them into war with france.

 
And the United States failed in it's invasion of Canada, it failed to gain concessions regarding impressment or the blockade and it suffered more casualties despite facing pretty much Britain's reserve team.
 

The USA was a small country, bounded by a native American empire to the east, the british to the north and the spanish to the south - all of whom wanted American territory.

Anyway, as usual it was a nice attempt by you to misinterpret historical events.

I notice you conveniently ignored the issues of impressment and the blockade, which were more important US war goals then the Native Americans.

 
lol, the US didn't want to take canada, it wanted to be left to its own devices, which the british didn't seem to want, as they kept getting involved in the internal affairs of the US.

 

The numerous failed American invasions of Canada paints a some what different picture.

 
Britain's attempt to break democracy and freedom, which threatened your empire.

 

Oh here we go again  
The United States did not invent democracy. Democracy was around long before the US came to fruition. Britain has had an elected parliament since before the Americas were even discovered. The US was not even democratic. It was a slave-owning nation, for crying out loud!

 
The US wasn't the aggressor nation, it was britain who tried to capture Americans (both born and naturalized) and force them into war with france.

 

The British didn't try to capture Americans, they tried to capture Britons. Naturalisation wasn't a concept accepted under British law of the time. These convicts and deserters were British, privy to be called upon to do their duty for King and country. The fact that America was attempting to grant them assylum is irrelevant.

 
The USA was a small country, bounded by a native American empire to the east, the british to the north and the spanish to the south - all of whom wanted American territory.

 

Point being?

 
Anyway, as usual it was a nice attempt by you to misinterpret historical events.

 

Are you actually saying that I usually misinterpret historical events? Are you taking the piss? Did you just say that? The man who didn't know that Puerto Rico was a US territory? Or thought that the United States suffered the most casualties during WW1? On your bike son.
 
 
 
I notice you conveniently ignored the issues of impressment and the blockade, which were more important US war goals then the Native Americans.

 

It didn't achieve every goal, no, but no war ever results in every aim being achieved.

 
The numerous failed American invasions of Canada paints a some what different picture.
 

That was to recover those people who wanted to be a part of the US and it was partially a preemptive measure to defend US sovereignty.

 
Oh here we go again  
The United States did not invent democracy. Democracy was around long before the US came to fruition. Britain has had an elected parliament since before the Americas were even discovered. The US was not even democratic. It was a slave-owning nation, for crying out loud!
 

You could only vote in britain if you had land, that's not democracy. The US may not have invented democracy, but it did invent modern democracy and it was the first nation that actively tried to spread democracy and combat imperialism.

 
The British didn't try to capture Americans, they tried to capture Britons. Naturalisation wasn't a concept accepted under British law of the time. These convicts and deserters were British, privy to be called upon to do their duty for King and country. The fact that America was attempting to grant them assylum is irrelevant.
 

Why? Why did they have to do their duty for someone born into that position. Many of these people agreed with freedom and agreed with the ideals of the US over britain. They were Americans in the US' eyes, they wanted to be American and britain wouldn't have it. Isn't that exactly the argument that britain uses now for the falkland islands? lol.

 
Point being?
 

The US wasn't the aggressor, it was simply a fledgling nation trying to resist intervention by larger countries.

 
Are you actually saying that I usually misinterpret historical events? Are you taking the piss? Did you just say that? The man who didn't know that Puerto Rico was a US territory? Or thought that the United States suffered the most casualties during WW1? On your bike son.
 

Yes, you portray the british empire in a blatantly false light. I realize that I've made ignorant comments before, but I'm not trying to change history here.
 
 
 
It didn't achieve every goal, no, but no war ever results in every aim being achieved.

 

So once more, just to clarify, one out of three constitutes a victory in your eyes?

 
That was to recover those people who wanted to be a part of the US and it was partially a preemptive measure to defend US sovereignty.

 

Who exactly were 'those people who wanted to be a part of the US'? The Canadians? Good lord, are you on drugs? Canada at the time was populated by loyalists who took up arms, formed militia groups and fought off the US invasions. They don't sound very much like the actions of people who wanted to join the US.

 
You could only vote in britain if you had land, that's not democracy. The US may not have invented democracy, but it did invent modern democracy

 

In America, black people couldn't vote. Oh yeah, they were also kept as slaves. Doesn't sound too democratic or modern to me.

 
and it was the first nation that actively tried to spread democracy and combat imperialism.

 

The United States conquered land off of Spain, Mexico and the Native American tribes. Are you telling me that the best way to combat imperialism is to infact practice it yourself? Well if that's the case, then no country did more to combat imperialism than Britian.

 
Why? Why did they have to do their duty for someone born into that position.

 

Oh sorry, I guess doing your duty for a flag is so much less archaic.  

 
Many of these people agreed with freedom and agreed with the ideals of the US over britain.

 

No, the majority were convicts and military deserters who fled to America to escape punishment.

 
They were Americans in the US' eyes, they wanted to be American and britain wouldn't have it.

 

They weren't American in Britain's eyes though, that's the whole point.

 
Isn't that exactly the argument that britain uses now for the falkland islands? lol.

 

No, not really, not even in the slightest. The war of 1812 happened in the early 19th century. The UN charter didn't even exist back then. Take off your rose tinted retrospective glasses why don't you?

 
The US wasn't the aggressor, it was simply a fledgling nation trying to resist intervention by larger countries.

 

So a nation that invades another one, isn't the aggressor? You've been paying too much attention to George W. Bush.

 
Yes, you portray the british empire in a blatantly false light.

 

And exactly what blatantly false light is this?

 
I realize that I've made ignorant comments before, but I'm not trying to change history here.

 

Apparently, despite the USA invading Canada, they aren't the aggressor. Apparently, the Canadians wanted to be liberated. Apparently, Britain wanted to annex the US. What you are doing is the definition of changing history.
 
 
 
So once more, just to clarify, one out of three constitutes a victory in your eyes?

 

The US achieved its primary aims to gain more sovereignty and control of surrounding regions.

 
Who exactly were 'those people who wanted to be a part of the US'? The Canadians? Good lord, are you on drugs? Canada at the time was populated by loyalists who took up arms, formed militia groups and fought off the US invasions. They don't sound very much like the actions of people who wanted to join the US.
 

The US didn't want to take over Canada, it wanted to fight off the british who kept getting involved in US affairs. What right did britain have to try and stop US expansion? It had nothing to do with britain.

 
In America, black people couldn't vote. Oh yeah, they were also kept as slaves. Doesn't sound too democratic or modern to me.
 

No, I admit, but none of the world was any better.

 
The United States conquered land off of Spain, Mexico and the Native American tribes. Are you telling me that the best way to combat imperialism is to infact practice it yourself? Well if that's the case, then no country did more to combat imperialism than Britian.
 

It wasn't imperialism. The US didn't try and colonize far off places.

 
Oh sorry, I guess doing your duty for a flag is so much less archaic.  
 

It's a duty to an ideal, not a person.

 
They weren't American in Britain's eyes though, that's the whole point.
 

Who cares what britain thought? I care about what those Americans thought. They wanted freedom of oppression.

 
No, not really, not even in the slightest. The war of 1812 happened in the early 19th century. The UN charter didn't even exist back then. Take off your rose tinted retrospective glasses why don't you?
 

But there are similarities, do you not think? A group of people wanting to be protected by one country, while another tries to take them over?

 
So a nation that invades another one, isn't the aggressor? You've been paying too much attention to George W. Bush.
 

It's not black and white like that. It depends on the circumstances.

 
And exactly what blatantly false light is this?
 

That the US was the aggressor, that the US didn't win, that britain is so perfect.

 
Apparently, despite the USA invading Canada, they aren't the aggressor. Apparently, the Canadians wanted to be liberated. Apparently, Britain wanted to annex the US. What you are doing is the definition of changing history.
 

I think britain did want to break the US' back - punish it for fighting for freedom.
 
 
 
The US achieved its primary aims to gain more sovereignty and control of surrounding regions.

 

It's primary aims were to end impressment and the blockade, of which it failed to do. How exactly did it gain more sovereignty, and exactly which British regions did it gain control of?

 
The US didn't want to take over Canada, it wanted to fight off the british who kept getting involved in US affairs.

 

I never said that annexing Canada was an original war game. I want you to explain the notion that Canadians infact wanted to join the US.

 
What right did britain have to try and stop US expansion? It had nothing to do with britain.

 

When that expansion involves attacking a British ally, it has everything to do with Britain.

 
It wasn't imperialism. The US didn't try and colonize far off places.

 

Oh well, when you put it like that...it's still imperialism. Conquering, subjugating and annexing foreign land is imperialism, regardless of whether it's in a far off place or on your door step. And as Hawaii and the Philippines shows, the US also partook in the far off kind.

 
It's a duty to an ideal, not a person.

 

So is the phrase 'King and Country'. A Monarch is a personification and symbol of the country. Anyhows, rather fight for an actual person than an inanimate object.

 
Who cares what britain thought? I care about what those Americans thought. They wanted freedom of oppression.

 

Who cares what America thought? I care about what Britain thinks. See how that works?

 
But there are similarities, do you not think? A group of people wanting to be protected by one country, while another tries to take them over?

 

No, because the Falkland Islanders aren't Argentine born criminals who have fled to British jurisdiction to escape punishment or their duty.

 
That the US was the aggressor, that the US didn't win, that britain is so perfect.

 

First off, I have never said that Britain is so perfect.
Secondly, the US didn't win. That's the truth. Read the bloomin' Treaty of Ghent if you don't believe me.

 
I think britain did want to break the US' back - punish it for fighting for freedom.

 

Well, if you think it, it must be true  
If you can show me one single offical contempary British government document, or quote one single British government official of the time, that states that British actions during the war of 1812 were revenge for the revolution, then fair plays. Otherwise, on your bike son.
 
 
Have you read the article? Or just read the title and taken offence?
The article is a balanced, reasoned, description of how the Canadian nation and national identity were forged.
Your reply is facile, biased and relies heavily upon semantics.

You argue that the country of Canada did not officially exist at that time, which is true, yet people refered to that region as Canada and its inhabitants as Canadians even during that time. There are numerous examples of senior U.S. Politicians using the word Canada.
Would the title of the article have satisfied you if it had been the rather unwieldy “That Time the inhabitants of the region that would later become part of the sovereign nation of Canada,but at that time were refered to as the colonies of upper Canada and lower Canada, Beat the Americans”?
The article states :-

 
“The reasons the United States invaded Canada were, and remain, contentious and unclear. Officially, residues of the revolution — unresolved issues of maritime law, military conscription, and possession of the Ohio Country — led to the declaration of war on June 18, 1812. But the unofficial reasons — the prize and the odds of success — were grubby, petty.”

Impressment whilst brutal to modern observers was little more than the draft for the Navy, British citizens who were sailors were pressed into naval service, during the Napoleonic war huge numbers were pressed and one method of avoiding being pressed was to claim citizenship of another country eg the USA. Many british press gangs stretched the burden of proof of citizenship beyond what was legal, resulting in some US citizens wrongly identified as British and impressed. Legal appeals saw many freed but clearly many were not.

One of the “official” reasons of the war was impressment, but no-one ether modern historians or contemporary commentators think that was the real reason. Impressment angered the americans but it was hardly a reason to invade Canada and no-one at the time seriously thought it was. It's like saying “your dog has pissed on my lawn so i'm gonna steal your car” then getting pissed off because the judge and all the jury think you stole the car because you just wanted the car.

You argue that the war was an american victory because impressment stopped, yet impressment was only used to increase the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic wars, once Napoleon was defeated, the size of the Navy was reduced and impressment was no longer necessary.

Wars are seldom fought for the “official” reasons, do you seriously think the second Iraq war had anything to do with “weapons of mass destruction”?

In terms of victory and defeat it is true that the war produced no outright victor or looser and ground down to a pointless stalemate, all sides were glad to sign the treaty ending the war, yet that treaty firmly established a border between the USA and Canada and put an end to US dreams of expansion northward and turned their attentions to expanding westward and the policy of “manifest destiny”.
Having your capitol city sacked and the whitehouse burnt hardly counts as a US win!

You argue that Canada as a nation did not exist in 1812, which is true, the territories in question were called Upper Canada and Lower Canada at that time and now roughly correspond to Quebec and Ontario. The author of the article does not deny that, the whole point of the article is to show how this war united a wide range of white settlers and indigenous tribes into the nation we now know as Canada.

So Americans can be Americans before the USA formally existed yet Canadians can’t ? is that your argument?

As for “lies and propaganda”, the article is certainly pro Canadian but where are the lies? Apart from a minor error about Sir Isaac Brocks knighthood the article is sound.
 
 
 
It's primary aims were to end impressment and the blockade, of which it failed to do. How exactly did it gain more sovereignty, and exactly which British regions did it gain control of?

 

Actually, it did succeed in ending the disgusting act of impressment. I don't care what the british thought. They illegally boarded US ships and took people against their will, simply for being born in britain.

 
I never said that annexing Canada was an original war game. I want you to explain the notion that Canadians infact wanted to join the US.
 

The US was defending itself from subversive british imperialism.

 
Oh well, when you put it like that...it's still imperialism. Conquering, subjugating and annexing foreign land is imperialism, regardless of whether it's in a far off place or on your door step. And as Hawaii and the Philippines shows, the US also partook in the far off kind.
 

In a lot of cases the people wanted to be part of the USA, such as when the US obtained texas.

 
So is the phrase 'King and Country'. A Monarch is a personification and symbol of the country. Anyhows, rather fight for an actual person than an inanimate object.
 

I'd rather fight for an uncorrupted ideal than an unelected despot who represents nothing related to freedom.

 
No, because the Falkland Islanders aren't Argentine born criminals who have fled to British jurisdiction to escape punishment or their duty.
 

I didn't realize being born in britain qualified as criminality. That's all a lot of naturalized Americans were, and yet they were still seized.

 
First off, I have never said that Britain is so perfect.
Secondly, the US didn't win. That's the truth. Read the bloomin' Treaty of Ghent if you don't believe me.
 

It forced an end to impressment in 1814, it successfully defended its territory and fought off an imperialistic european power. I think it was a victory for the US. I don't know how you can think it wasn't.

 
Well, if you think it, it must be true  
If you can show me one single offical contempary British government document, or quote one single British government official of the time, that states that British actions during the war of 1812 were revenge for the revolution, then fair plays. Otherwise, on your bike son.
 

What about the burning of washington? That was a clear attempt to destroy freedom.

I don't know how you think it was!
Impressment stopped when the Napoleonic war ended, long before the treaty of Ghent.
Britain, along with half of Europe was busy fighting Napoleon who had captured the other half of europe, hardly the time for Britain to start an imperialistic war elsewhere which would divert much needed troops and resources from the real front.

 
What about the burning of washington? That was a clear attempt to destroy freedom.

 

A clear attempt to demoralise the politicians, little damage was done to civilian property, unlike the american pillaging of canadian towns in the early stages of the war which united canadian public opinion against the US and ended Jeffersons prediction that conquering Canada would be “a mere matter of marching,”
 
 
 
Actually, it did succeed in ending the disgusting act of impressment. I don't care what the british thought.

 

I don't care what the Americans thought. The act of impressment ended when Napoleon was first defeated in Europe, not as a result of anything the Americans did during the War of 1812.

 
They illegally boarded US ships and took people against their will, simply for being born in britain.

 

I'm aware of what impressment was, and they didn't take people simply for being born in Britain, they took people because they were reneging on their military service. The vast majority of these people were deserters and criminals.

 
The US was defending itself from subversive british imperialism.

 

Can you read? How does that in any way answer my question?

 
In a lot of cases the people wanted to be part of the USA, such as when the US obtained texas.

 

Texas was an independent country that applied for statehood. I'm refering to when the US conquered land from Spain, Mexico and the Native Americans.

 
I'd rather fight for an uncorrupted ideal than an unelected despot who represents nothing related to freedom.

 

I'd rather fight for a living, breathing, inspirational and symbolic figure of my nation than a bloody inanimate object.

 
I didn't realize being born in britain qualified as criminality. That's all a lot of naturalized Americans were, and yet they were still seized.

 

Committing crimes certainly qualifies as criminality, such as deserting the military. Many of the impressed weren't even naturalized, they were simply be harboured on US merchant vessals.

 
It forced an end to impressment in 1814,

 

Napoleon tries to conquer Europe. To fight him, Britain must radically increase the size of it's standing navy. Thus, it introduces impressment. In 1814, Napoleon is defeated. Impressment ends. So, why did impressment end? Was it the result of Napoleon's defeat, whereby Britain no longer needed the manpower, or was it the conflict in North America, where at the time, the American invasion of Canada had been repulsed and Britain was consolidating it's position by sending over three fresh armies? Hmm, something tells me is was the former.

 
it successfully defended its territory and fought off an imperialistic european power.

 

Defended? Fought off? The US was the one that started the hostilities!

 
I think it was a victory for the US. I don't know how you can think it wasn't.

 

As I said, read the bloody Treaty of Ghent. The United States didn't gain a thing from Britain.
And the logic you use for American victory means that Britain also won, because it successfully defended Canada.

 
What about the burning of washington? That was a clear attempt to destroy freedom.

 

More like a clear attempt to destroy the American capital in revenge for the earlier American burning of York.
 
 
 
The US may not have invented democracy, but it did invent modern democracy and it was the first nation that actively tried to spread democracy and combat imperialism.

 

That's a bold claim, but I don't see how it is defensible. How is 'modern democracy' being measured?

The first country to ban slavery: The United Kingdom, 1807 (throughout the empire, 1833). The Royal Navy then occupied itself by hunting down slave ships.
First major country to give universal sufferage (which continues to today): New Zealand, 1893.
First county to attempt universal sufferage: The Corsican Republic, 1755-1769.

You can then go through several documents which took steps in the direction of granting universal rights such as in Britain the Magna Carta, the 1689 Bill of Rights, and some of the work of parliament after the English Civil War. Each of these were inspirational to the signers of the Declaration of Independence. Believe me, figures such as Washington, Franklin and Jefferson are inspirations to me also, but nothing they did was especially original, it was only original in North America. This idea of declaring liberty for all people (eg, "all men are created equal") but having in imaginary brackets "(by the way, not including women, children or ethnic minorities)" was nothing new, Jefferson even famously owned slaves.

At what point are you claiming that the US invented modern democracy and at what point did it seek to combat imperialism? Is this before or after Manifest Destiny? Can the political ideology of Manifest Destiny be classed as anything but imperialism by another name?
 
 
Canada and the US are essentially the offspring of the UK.

Canada got a respectable degree and went on to become a lawyer.

The US became a cocaine dealer.

...but we love them both really.
 
 
The US has been trying to change history for years, why should we care?
 
 
Why don't we call it a draw? It seems to me that at the end of the war things largely stayed the same as they were before. Either that or the situation had changed due to external factors (impressment ended because the war against Napoleon ended). Both the USA and Britain kept the same territory they had before. Doesn't sound like either side really won or lost. Not all wars are as simple as having a winner and loser.
 
 
 
I don't care what the Americans thought. The act of impressment ended when Napoleon was first defeated in Europe, not as a result of anything the Americans did during the War of 1812.

 

So, you're suggesting it was a coincidence that impressment ended after the US fought back?

 
I'm aware of what impressment was, and they didn't take people simply for being born in Britain, they took people because they were reneging on their military service. The vast majority of these people were deserters and criminals.
 

These people were forced to fight simply because they were british. I know I can't really apply modern principles to the past, but it sickens me that these people were forced to fight in the navy and even some non-british people were forced to fight too.

 
Texas was an independent country that applied for statehood. I'm refering to when the US conquered land from Spain, Mexico and the Native Americans.
 

 
I'd rather fight for a living, breathing, inspirational and symbolic figure of my nation than a bloody inanimate object.
 

I'd rather fight for a principle and an idea than a person. Many kings and queens were not nice people - to anyone.

The US had no intention of taking Canada, and it was successful in of its advances - which were mostly aimed to make britain back off.

 
Defended? Fought off? The US was the one that started the hostilities!
 

Only after American citizens (even ones born in the US) were being kidnapped from American ports and vessels. The US only went to war as a last resort.

 
As I said, read the bloody Treaty of Ghent. The United States didn't gain a thing from Britain.
And the logic you use for American victory means that Britain also won, because it successfully defended Canada.
 

I don't believe the US wanted Canada, it wanted to protect its citizens.

 
More like a clear attempt to destroy the American capital in revenge for the earlier American burning of York.
 

Heh, okay, both sides looted and pillaged I guess. First I've heard about the burning of york though.
 
 
 
That's a bold claim, but I don't see how it is defensible. How is 'modern democracy' being measured?

First major country to give universal sufferage (which continues to today): New Zealand, 1893.
First county to attempt universal sufferage: The Corsican Republic, 1755-1769.

 

It wasn't for moral reasons. It was because they felt that making slavery illegal was preferable to a revolution or uprising. The US also banned slavery not that long after.

 
You can then go through several documents which took steps in the direction of granting universal rights such as in Britain the Magna Carta, the 1689 Bill of Rights, and some of the work of parliament after the English Civil War.

Okay, it wasn't original, but it was the first real implementation on a new country. Many other countries followed in the US' path later on too.

 
At what point are you claiming that the US invented modern democracy and at what point did it seek to combat imperialism? Is this before or after Manifest Destiny? Can the political ideology of Manifest Destiny be classed as anything but imperialism by another name?
 

It may have been expansionism, but it was a very different, less brutal form of imperialism than going out on ships and taking over new places.
 
 
 
The weren't immigrants or refugees, they were criminals and deserters to which the US government was giving assylum. At the time, British law did not allow it's citizens to give up citizenship. In the eyes of the UK, if you were born British, you die British. For the American government to harbour these people was a direct attack on the sovereignty of the British crown over its subjects.

 

What you said still doesn't make any sense. Why should another country follow the laws of another? If there is no previous agreement, then they don't have to return them.

 
Of course it matters why it was stopped. For America's military campaign to have been a success, American military or political action must have been why Britain gave up impressment. It wasn't. At the end of the war, the British Admiralty reserved the right to re-introduce the policy at it's own prerogative. Britain reserved the right to blockade the high seas at it's own prerogative. These were the two key issues America went to war for, and at the end of the conflict it had resolved neither. The only person who achieved all their objectives was the United Kingdom; the defence of Canada and status quo in North America.

 

It doesn't matter because the objective was achieved. Impressment ended and American respect was gained. Britain didn't continue doing impressment and avoided threatening US sovereignty in fears of provoking another war. This is why I've said the US has more of a right to claim victory because they achieved everything they intended.
 
 
 
What are you on about? You tried to paint the US as the underdogs in the post I quoted. I am telling you that the Canadians the US fought were infact the underdogs.

Yes we know Canada didn't exist as a sovereign nation, but the people that would later make up the state of Canada did. These are the people that fought the US.

 

The US never fought "Canadians" because the nationality of "Canadian" did not exist when the war took place.

THe US was the underdog because the US fought the British Empire, which was one of the strongest countries in the world.

 
And yes you can feel proud about the 7 years war if it helps you sleep at night. Honestly, no one gives a crap about pointless technicalities like these.

 

We don't feel patriotism about the 7 years war because it wasn't an American fought war. Canadians are trying to rewrite history and be patriotic about a war they had nothing to do with.
 
 
 
So, you're suggesting it was a coincidence that impressment ended after the US fought back?

 

Are you seriously suggesting that it's a coincedence that impressment ended shortly after the sole reason it was implemented in the first place- the Napoleonic wars- also ended?
Anyway, at the time impressment was abandoned, the United States had just been kicked out of most of Canada. Britain was sending dozens of warships and three fresh new armies over from Europe. The UK firmly had the upper hand at the time.

 
These people were forced to fight simply because they were british. I know I can't really apply modern principles to the past, but it sickens me that these people were forced to fight in the navy and even some non-british people were forced to fight too.

 

It's called conscription mate. You may have heard of it, probably as 'the draft'. You know, when the US forced millions of Americans to fight in Vietnam.

 
I'd rather fight for a principle and an idea than a person. Many kings and queens were not nice people - to anyone.

 

As I just said, the idea of Monarchy is that they embolden and pesonify the spirits and values of your country. We simply choose to be patriotic through the institution of Monarchy, you Americans do so through an inanimate object.

 
The US had no intention of taking Canada, and it was successful in of its advances - which were mostly aimed to make britain back off.

 

America was kicked out of Canada. It launched numerous invasions that all failed. How on earth is that successful? I also notice that your answer completely fails to address the actual point that I made.

 
Only after American citizens (even ones born in the US) were being kidnapped from American ports and vessels. The US only went to war as a last resort.

 

They were never 'kidnapped' from American ports. Don't be silly. They were 'kidnapped', from US vessels if they were suspected of being a fugitive. Don't act like the US has never going into other countries to arrest American fugitives.

 
I don't believe the US wanted Canada, it wanted to protect its citizens.

 

The UK never wanted America. That's the point I was making. The logic that you are using is deeply flawed. If America won the war because it repulsed the British invasion, then that very same logic means that Britain won the war, because it repulsed the American invasion.

 
Heh, okay, both sides looted and pillaged I guess. First I've heard about the burning of york though.

 

Yeah, you burned down the Canadian legislative assembly, which is why Britain took revenge and burned down the White house.
 
 
 
The US never fought "Canadians" because the nationality of "Canadian" did not exist when the war took place.

THe US was the underdog because the US fought the British Empire, which was one of the strongest countries in the world.

We don't feel patriotism about the 7 years war because it wasn't an American fought war. Canadians are trying to rewrite history and be patriotic about a war they had nothing to do with.

 

Are you really this foolish or are you putting on an act?

The US did not fight the British Empire in it's entirety. The US fought the Canadian holdings of the British Empire ONLY and these Canadian holdings were weaker militarily than the US. The people the US fought were the ancestors of the first Canadian citizens.

It's so mindnumbingly obvious, I fail to see why you cannot comprehend. Get a life dude.
 
 
 
Just like the rebellious American colonies are claiming the history prior to secession from the British Crown?

I think you've misunderstood the term 'revisionist history' a bit.

 

Acknowledging/learning your history before rebellion and claiming British history are two different things.

 
Canadians have 'claim' to any history that occurs in their country, especially considering they are part of the Commonwealth (They still hold the Queen as head of state).

 

It wasn't their country at that time, so how can they claim the history?

So you're saying everything that Britain ever achieved in history should be credited to Canada as well.  
 
 
 
I think Canada can claim to have been involved in that war. The British North American colonies may not have been called Canada at the time, but modern Canada is clearly the continuation of those colonies.

Why do they celebrate Thanksgiving in the USA? The story of Thanksgiving predates the USA, yet I'm sure many Americans consider it to be a defining part of America's history.

Sometimes I like to think of the USA as "Canada's toilet"  

 

Christmas is not an American born holiday but Americans celebrate it.

Easter is not an American born Holiday but Americans celebrate it.

Halloween is not an American born holiday but Americans celebrate it.

Canadians are claiming the 1812 war for Canada and rewriting history to say "we defeated the US"

Everyone knows Canada's America's hat  
 
 
 
Canada fought in the war. It does not matter whether it was called canada or had its own government, it fought in the war. Canadian militia defeated US armies. I don't know why you can't understand this. My scotland example is exactly the same as this one, canada was in the British empire and scotland is in the UK. Thats the same thing. All parts of a nation or empire can claim that they were part of the victory of that nation or empire even if they later secede from it. You cannot just rewrite history and say "yeah canada had nothing to do with the war, nothing happened in north america other than us fighting some British people who have since dropped off the face of the earth and been replaced by these people called canadians".

Well the USA failed to achieve its objectives. Impressment was stopped because napoleon was defeated, you do understand that right? America declaring war had no effect at all. Everyone accepts this. It is also obvious because the peace treaty that ended the war did not mention impressment, the UK would have continued with this had the war with france continued. Every american attack was defeated and your capital city pillaged and burnt. Anyone with any intelligence would see that as a defeat. Essentially you faced a very weak British force as most of the British army was busy in europe, had the USA continued the war after napoleon had been defeated then it would have been crushed, completely and utterly crushed. It sued for peace because it could see what was coming.

Stop saying your country was young and weak, I don't know what point you are trying to make but it just sounds stupid. Germany was a young country of 43 years when it took on most of the world in ww1, your country was 31 years old when it took on a single over stretched power that was fighting the biggest war it had ever engaged in.

 

The examples aren't the same. Canada was not a government entity during the 1812 war. Scotland was a government entity before joining the British Empire and after.

So I guess we should all be saying that Jamaicans also fought during the 1812 war and "defeated the US"? Australians too? Since anyone once part of the British Empire can claim anything they want.  

Impressment ended. doesn't matter how or why but it ended. So US a objective was achieved.

Not every new country will be young and strong. America was young and weak.
 
 
 
It wasn't for moral reasons. It was because they felt that making slavery illegal was preferable to a revolution or uprising. The US also banned slavery not that long after.

 

I never said there weren't other motives in the final decision. William Wilberforce though campaigned for entirely moral reasons. The Royal Navy only captured slave ships for moral reasons, they otherwise gained little benefit from sailing around the Atlantic seeking conflict; there was no uprising to be feared from allowing other countries to trade.

It's a bit simplistic to say 'not long after', and you know that. It taken 50 more years, a civil war, and the might of the great Abraham Lincoln (a true American hero) to finally stamp slavery out.

 
Okay, it wasn't original, but it was the first real implementation on a new country. Many other countries followed in the US' path later on too.
 

Was it really the United States's path, though? If we look at some examples:

Women could vote in all US states in 1920. In Denmark it was 1915, in Finland it was 1906, in Australia it was 1908, in Norway it was 1913. The US was before many countries in this respect, but was it really leading the way?

The United States reached universal suffrage in 1964/1965 after the civil rights movement, as previously taxes and tests were used in southern states which were designed to specifically prevent black people from voting. In Norway, the right to prevent men from voting based on skin colour was completely removed in 1898, in New Zealand it was 1893, in Finland it was 1906, in Iceland it was 1882; before the Nazis, Germany had rather liberal voting laws and had full male suffrage in 1867. The US may have had Martin Luther King, but what needs to be realised is that the Scandinavian countries in particular didn't need a Martin Luther King figure in the first place.

Am I saying that the US was lagging behind? No, it was certainly no worse than France or the UK, but I'm simply rejecting the idea that the US was an uber-liberal country which was passing progressive laws giving the kind of liberty which left the rest of the world in its wake. That was not the case; the US neither led the way nor lagged behind. What actually happened was a slow move towards liberty and democracy throughout the western world.

 
It may have been expansionism, but it was a very different, less brutal form of imperialism than going out on ships and taking over new places.
 

It's just my opinion, but I see the effect of Manifest Destiny upon the native Americans being just as detrimental as the effects of the British in India or Ireland, or worse. I don't know how the kind of policy which led to  Wounded Knee , for example, could be described as especially favourable next to British imperialism, or the type that the home of democracy would promote. It wasn't the worst atrocity in history, no, but have Sweden ever done such a thing? The Danish? The Finnish? The Irish? The Belgians? The Polish? Maybe Britain was worse, but there are plenty of nations which have done even less than America. If you're trying to claim that America started modern democracy then it would help if it had a clean record with regards to actions towards people living within its borders (and not done things like Wounded Knee), like Sweden, Norway, etc; the US doesn't have that clean record.

I have to emphasise that I'm not trying to say that America has blood on its hands. I think America has generally been a moral and decent country, and a force for good generally in world affairs. However, your suggestion that America is the home of modern democracy is patently not true, and the idea that America led the way in starting democracy or spreading it throughout the west is also false, especially next to Scandinavia; you haven't given any evidence as to why this idea should be accepted.

Up to now, your only defence of this suggestion has been to fling dirt at the policies of the British Empire, a rather easy task, but I never suggested that the Empire was the spreader of modern democracy either. My home country knows that better than anyone. Your opponent here isn't just Britain, you need to demonstrate how the US led the way for France, Sweden, New Zealand, Belgium, Denmark, Canada and all the rest too. It didn't.
 
 
 
Have you read the article? Or just read the title and taken offence?
The article is a balanced, reasoned, description of how the Canadian nation and national identity were forged.
Your reply is facile, biased and relies heavily upon semantics.

You argue that the country of Canada did not officially exist at that time, which is true, yet people refered to that region as Canada and its inhabitants as Canadians even during that time. There are numerous examples of senior U.S. Politicians using the word Canada.

 

If you know it's true, then that should be the end of the discussion.

 
Would the title of the article have satisfied you if it had been the rather unwieldy “That Time the inhabitants of the region that would later become part of the sovereign nation of Canada,but at that time were refered to as the colonies of upper Canada and lower Canada, Beat the Americans ”?
The article states :-

 

You see not only is that article not fair and balanced but it's historically incorrect. The use of "Canada" is wrong because Canada as a country did not exist. And the US of "Beat" is wrong because Britain didn't defeat the US and America has more of a right to claim victory because all their objectives were achieved.

 
you state :-

Impressment whilst brutal to modern observers was little more than the draft for the Navy, British citizens who were sailors were pressed into naval service, during the Napoleonic war huge numbers were pressed and one method of avoiding being pressed was to claim citizenship of another country eg the USA. Many british press gangs stretched the burden of proof of citizenship beyond what was legal, resulting in some US citizens wrongly identified as British and impressed. Legal appeals saw many freed but clearly many were not.

One of the “official” reasons of the war was impressment, but no-one ether modern historians or contemporary commentators think that was the real reason. Impressment angered the americans but it was hardly a reason to invade Canada and no-one at the time seriously thought it was. It's like saying “your dog has pissed on my lawn so i'm gonna steal your car” then getting pissed off because the judge and all the jury think you stole the car because you just wanted the car.

You argue that the war was an american victory because impressment stopped, yet impressment was only used to increase the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic wars, once Napoleon was defeated, the size of the Navy was reduced and impressment was no longer necessary.

Wars are seldom fought for the “official” reasons, do you seriously think the second Iraq war had anything to do with “weapons of mass destruction”?

In terms of victory and defeat it is true that the war produced no outright victor or looser and ground down to a pointless stalemate, all sides were glad to sign the treaty ending the war, yet that treaty firmly established a border between the USA and Canada and put an end to US dreams of expansion northward and turned their attentions to expanding westward and the policy of “manifest destiny”.
Having your capitol city sacked and the whitehouse burnt hardly counts as a US win!

You state :-

apart from capturing the territories of upper and lower Canada (modern day Quebec and Ontario), which 99% of historians agree was the true reason for invading Canada.

 

Wow. More fiction.

 
You argue that Canada as a nation did not exist in 1812, which is true, the territories in question were called Upper Canada and Lower Canada at that time and now roughly correspond to Quebec and Ontario. The author of the article does not deny that, the whole point of the article is to show how this war united a wide range of white settlers and indigenous tribes into the nation we now know as Canada.

You state :-

and :-

So Americans can be Americans before the USA formally existed yet Canadians can’t ? is that your argument?

As for “lies and propaganda”, the article is certainly pro Canadian but where are the lies? Apart from a minor error about Sir Isaac Brocks knighthood the article is sound.

 

Americans weren't American before the revolution. And Canadians weren't Canadian until 1867.

That article is a great work of mythology.
 
 
 
What you said still doesn't make any sense. Why should another country follow the laws of another? If there is no previous agreement, then they don't have to return them.

 

Exactly. Why whould another country follow the laws of another? Nuetralisation was a concept of America and not recognised under British law. In the eyes of the British, America was simply harbouring fugitives.

 
It doesn't matter because the objective was achieved. Impressment ended and American respect was gained.

 

Not really, because Britain reserved the right to reintroduce policy and blockades in the future at it's own prerogative.
American respect was gained? Don't think so.

 
Britain didn't continue doing impressment and avoided threatening US sovereignty in fears of provoking another war. This is why I've said the US has more of a right to claim victory because they achieved everything they intended.

 

Britain didn't continue with impressment because they had no need for it. Napoleon was defeated, Europe was in relative peace. You are severly flattering the United States. Without commitments elsewhere, Britain could flatten America. The threat of war means nothing.
America achieved only one goal out of three- breaking the Native American confederacy. Britain on the otherhand achieved it's sole objective: the defence of Canada and return to status quo. Therefore, Britain has a better claim to victory.
 
 
 
Canada and the US are essentially the offspring of the UK.

Canada got a respectable degree and went on to become a lawyer.

The US became a cocaine dealer.

...but we love them both really.

 

If you call having -- the world's largest economy, world's strongest military, world's most influential politics, world's reserve currency, world's best universities, world's best technology(went to the moon) with the world's best tech companies: Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, etc., world's most influential culture with the world's most successful entertainment industry -- being a cocaine dealer, then you must seriously be on crack cocaine.

Plus, Canada is the UK offspring. The US created itself via revolution.
 
 
 
It wasn't for moral reasons. It was because they felt that making slavery illegal was preferable to a revolution or uprising.

 

Even coming from you, this is a new level of ignorance. There was no threat of a slave uprising in the colonies or even a fear of one. The abolitionist movement in the UK was lead by Evangelicals and Quakers who believed that slavery was un-Christian. Like always, you've based your statement on absolutely no fact. You seem to have a habit of just making stuff up to suit your viewpoint.
 
 
 
It wasn't for moral reasons. It was because they felt that making slavery illegal was preferable to a revolution or uprising. The US also banned slavery not that long after.

Okay, it wasn't original, but it was the first real implementation on a new country. Many other countries followed in the US' path later on too.

It may have been expansionism, but it was a very different, less brutal form of imperialism than going out on ships and taking over new places.

 

No. Don't let him confuse you. The US created the world's first modern democracy with the world's first written constitution and bill of rights.

The magna carta propped up a monarchy, which is the exact opposite of a democracy. Before the US, every country was a monarchy. The US then inspired the French to revolt and the rest is history.
 
 
 
Are you really this foolish or are you putting on an act?

The US did not fight the British Empire in it's entirety.

 

Whose fault is that? Do you know how war works? Should America have waited for Britain to get ready first?  

 
The US fought the Canadian holdings of the British Empire ONLY and these Canadian holdings were weaker militarily than the US. The people the US fought were the ancestors of the first Canadian citizens.

It's so mindnumbingly obvious, I fail to see why you cannot comprehend. Get a life dude.

 

THe US fought the British Empire not Canada because Canada did not exist.
 
 
 
Exactly. Why whould another country follow the laws of another? Nuetralisation was a concept of America and not recognised under British law. In the eyes of the British, America was simply harbouring fugitives.

 

You're still not making sense. If there's no agreement between the two countries then why would the US comply with British laws?

 
Not really, because Britain reserved the right to reintroduce policy and blockades in the future at it's own prerogative.
American respect was gained? Don't think so.

Britain didn't continue with impressment because they had no need for it. Napoleon was defeated, Europe was in relative peace. You are severly flattering the United States. Without commitments elsewhere, Britain could flatten America. The threat of war means nothing.
America achieved only one goal out of three- breaking the Native American confederacy. Britain on the otherhand achieved it's sole objective: the defence of Canada and return to status quo. Therefore, Britain has a better claim to victory.

 

And America reserved the right to retaliate again on the bases of national security. Fact is Britain got the message, and after the war, impressment was no longer an issue and British bullying and disrespect had ended. The US achieved all it's objective and has more of a right to claim victory. The British never continued doing what it was doing before the war and did not defeat a younger and weaker country, so therefore the British lost.
 
 
Meanwhile, everywhere other than North America...
 
 
 
Before the US, every country was a monarchy. The US then inspired the French to revolt and the rest is history.

 

Nonsense, there were loads of mercantile republics in Europe, right up until the 19th century. You Americans crack me up with your delusions of granduer. You didn't inspire anyone to revolt. People have been revolting since the dawn of time, and will be revolting till hell freezes over. The French revolution came about because of the mismanagement of the country by their King. America didn't factor into the equation.
 
 
 
You're still not making sense. If there's no agreement between the two countries then why would the US comply with British laws?

 

I never said they were. But you seem to think that Britain should have complied with American nuetralisation laws.

 
And America reserved the right to retaliate again on the bases of national security. Fact is Britain got the message, and after the war, impressment was no longer an issue and British bullying and disrespect had ended. The US achieved all it's objective and has more of a right to claim victory. The British never continued doing what it was doing before the war and did not defeat a younger and weaker country, so therefore the British lost.

 

My word, you Americans are delusional.
Napoleon was defeated. Napoleon. Have you heard of Napoleon? He tried to conquer Europe. Napoleon. Impressment was introduced to combat Napoleon. When Napoleon, that's right, Napoleon, I said Napoleon, was defeated, impressment ended. Napoleon. Not an irrelevant sideshow of a war in North America. Napoleon. Napoleon. America's military campaign during the war of 1812, which failed in it's invasion of Canada and was repulsed, did not factor into the equation. Napoleon did. Because Napoleon could actually threaten the UK. America couldn't. Napoleon. Britain never continued doing what it was doing before the war because after the war, Napoleon was defeated. Do you understand now? Napoleon. America failed to conquer Canada, it failed to gain concessions on impressment or blockades, it failed to even get compensation for impressment. Fail, fail, fail. But apparently you Americans have no ambition, because in your books, fail, fail, fail somehow constitutes a victory.

Please name these mercantile republics. Fact is the US created the world's first modern democracy with the world's first written constitution and bill of rights. I don't know why this bothers you, I thought you Brits would've accepted your situation by now. Britain is not even a republic and still has monarchy.

The US kicked off the enlightenment revolution era and inspired the French Revolution.
 
 
 
No. Don't let him confuse you. The US created the world's first modern democracy with the world's first written constitution and bill of rights.

The magna carta propped up a monarchy, which is the exact opposite of a democracy. Before the US, every country was a monarchy. The US then inspired the French to revolt and the rest is history.

 

Don't be silly, I'm out to establish fact, not to brainwash anyone.

The original constitution and bill of rights didn't allow for women to vote, or black people to vote, and they allowed slavery to continue. The constitution had to be amended over a century later to allow the first two, and decades later to prevent the third. Therefore, the constitution and bill of rights in their original form did not establish a modern democracy. Modern democracies give suffrage to all.

You do not see the implications of the Magna Carta; it was a slight at royal control by the nobility, who forced King John's hand. Up to that point, the Monarchy had proposed the idea that it was untouchable, bound by no law except God's law, presenting the idea that monarchs were appointed by God himself. For the first time, the King's powers were limited; citizens had to be punished through the legal system only, the Church was free from royal control, the King couldn't abuse his wards, and so on. It was a limitation. It didn't particularly do much good for the peasants, but it set a precedent that royal control could be questioned, an idea which would come back to haunt the Monarchy in 1642.

Before the US, every country was a monarchy? What about the results of the English Civil War? The Protectorate? The actions of John Pym, John Hampden, Denzil Holles, William Strode, Edward Montagu and Arthur Haselrig had a profound effect on those who signed the Declaration of Independence. America's independence and the execution of Charles I were equally inspirational for the French republicans.

If you're interested, other republics that pre-date the United States include the  Dutch Republic , the  Corsican Republic , the  Icelandic Commonwealth , the  Swiss Confederation , the  Novgorod Republic , the  Pskov Republic  and famously the  Roman Republic . The US was not the first country to be a republic. The US doesn't even take the award for the longest still existing republic, the  Republic of San Marino  has been a republic since it left the Roman empire in 301 AD, and it still exists today, 1,700 years later.
 
 
 
I never said they were. But you seem to think that Britain should have complied with American nuetralisation laws.

 

I don't think you understand how this works. When something from one something enters another country (whether it be a person or thing), and there's no previous agreement, then the other country has no obligation to return it. The same way if US technology get's into the hands of the Chinese, the Chinese don't have to return it. Or if the Chinese detain a US citizen, the Chinese don't have to release them. This is why what you're saying makes no sense.

 
My word, you Americans are delusional.

I'm aware that Napoleon was defeated during the 1812 war. But you still don't understand -- What does it matter how a objective was achieved? As long is the problem is no longer a problem, then the objective was achieved. Impressment of US sailors was no longer occurring after the war, therefore the US chalks it up as objective achieved. Britain on the other hand was the instigator before the war, and stopped instigating after the war, which is why the British lost. If Britain hadn't lost, they would have kept doing exactly what they were doing before the war - instigating, bullying, and impressment.

No one said it was the first perfect modern democracy, but it was the world's first modern democracy, while the ancient greeks had the first ancient democracy.

I don't know what definition of "modern democracy" you're using, but it appears to be one based on fiction. Do babies and dogs get to vote as well?

Our constitution is always improving, just as our framers intended it be. We corrected foolish mistakes and gave everyone the right to vote.

A "slight" doesn't equal you're now a republic and democracy. Britain needed a real revolution not a half-assed attempt. To this day the monarchy is propped up and it will probably remain that way.

England still had a monarchy afterwards, and still has one to this day.

It's possible some of those could be considered republics, but they're not democracies. China claims to be a republic, but it's not a democracy. The US is a republic and democracy, the world's first modern democracy with the world's first written constitution and bill of rights to be exact.

If Britain hadn't lost, they would have kept doing exactly what they were doing before the war - instigating, bullying, and impressment.

 

It actually matters greatly how an objective is achieved when you're analysing who won a war. The British didn't stop impressment because the Americans made them, they did it because they wanted to. The reason why they stopped impressing after 1814 was because Napoleon was defeated and the British Isles were no longer under threat of invasion thus necessitating absolutely every naval resource the UK had.

The simple fact is that the USA came into the war with a couple objectives: 1. to gain respect of neutral shipping rights and stop impressment and 2. to conquer Canada.

In regards to the first issue the UK never respected neutral shipping rights throughout the war and the Americans never made them do so. It was a somewhat ridiculous idea to put forth in the first place, the Americans hilariously enough wanted to continue trading with France and giving the French the goods to continue fighting a war and for the British not to care based upon some ridiculous abstract concept of neutral rights, surprisingly the British ignored the Americans. Then again this was in the era when Jefferson wishy washy totally impractical abstract theories were actively put into practice, lets not forget the insane and devastating Embargo Acts leading up to the war.

In regards to the second point. Despite what you've said earlier in the thread, annexation of Canada was very important and if you read primary sources from nearly all the main actors on the American side they very much wanted to annex Canada. Jefferson claimed it was just a matter of marching into Canada with a few thousand men and taking it, not surprisingly he was proven wrong.

Thus America achieved none of her initial aims by military force. Likewise the British didn't really achieve any of their goals (as limited as they were - the British couldn't give a toss for the war and didn't want it, they were much more focused on Europe and just wanted the American thing over), the plan for an independent Indian nation blocking American expansion failed, they failed to gain exclusive use of the Great Lakes, they also failed to gain parts of Maine they wanted to annex.

Ipso facto neither side won the war. However the Treaty of Ghent cleaned up some past disagreements, the end of the Napoleonic Wars ended impressment and the two nations would grow closer and closer over the century. Thus both benefitted from the draw although the Native Americans got totally boned.

In regards to your initial point.The Canadian militia fighting alongside the British regulars are the forebearers of the Canadian nation, they came from the colonies of Upper and Lower Canada and played a huge role in defending the Canadas from the initial American invasions. While the oft mentioned idea that the Canadians burned Washington down is total rubbish (it was entirely British regulars) they still performed a very useful role in defending Canada. While they can't claim to have solely defeated the Americans in 1812-15 (it should be regarded as a draw) they can certainly share in the spoils of the war. It was incredibly important for developing the Canadian national identity, especially when the Canadian population at the time was a total mish mash of United Empire Loyalists who'd fled the States after the Revolution, new immigrants from the UK, old French Canadiens and a large population of recent American immigrants. It began the process of fusing them all into one culture and community and that's why it's so important for Canadians. It's exactly the same as the importance of the Revolution to the Americans.
 
 
 
Even coming from you, this is a new level of ignorance. There was no threat of a slave uprising in the colonies or even a fear of one. The abolitionist movement in the UK was lead by Evangelicals and Quakers who believed that slavery was un-Christian. Like always, you've based your statement on absolutely no fact. You seem to have a habit of just making stuff up to suit your viewpoint.

 

Ever heard of the 'many headed hydra' description of the workforce, in reference to the fact that quelling rebellion is hard? They most certainly were worried about laborers teaming up (slaves and indentured servants).

I'm not making facts up.
 
 
 
No one said it was the first perfect modern democracy, but it was the world's first modern democracy, while the ancient greeks had the first ancient democracy.

Our constitution is always improving, just as our framers intended it be. We corrected foolish mistakes and gave everyone the right to vote.

 

Ah, but my friend, you're the one claiming that the US was the "first modern democracy". How are you defining a modern democracy when you say that? By whatever measure you use, we'll see if I'm able to find a country that beat the US to it.

In my opinion the best definition of 'modern democracy' is the right of anyone over 21 to vote (though preferably 18), and not discriminating based on gender or race. If we use that measure, New Zealand was first.

Are you suggesting that the US qualify for this title simply by having a Bill of Rights? England had one in  1689  and it's still in force to this day. San Marino, which as we have established has been a republic for 1,700 years, has had a constitution since  1600 . Why are neither of these qualifications for being a modern democracy, but the US's constitution was? What exact rights did the US constitution give that makes you believe it was the first modern democracy?

 
A "slight" doesn't equal you're now a republic and democracy. Britain needed a real revolution not a half-assed attempt. To this day the monarchy is propped up and it will probably remain that way.

England still had a monarchy afterwards, and still has one to this day.
 

'You're'? I'm neither English nor British.

I never said that the Magna Carta made England a democracy, it was just an example of a document which inspired the Founding Fathers (  see here  for an example of how it inspired them). In my opinion, Britain only became a true modern democracy in 1928.

 
It's possible some of those could be considered republics, but they're not democracies. China claims to be a republic, but it's not a democracy. The US is a republic and democracy, the world's first modern democracy with the world's first written constitution and bill of rights to be exact.
 

Again, that really depends on how you're defining "first modern democracy", as I've already demonstrated, the US was not the first to have a bill of rights.
 
 
 
I never said they were. But you seem to think that Britain should have complied with American nuetralisation laws.

I don't think you can suggest that the US fighting back was a small issue for the british. The US was almost as strong a force as napolean in europe, it's just that the USA was further away from britain and didn't want to conquer britain.

America didn't want to annex canada - it was some rhetoric used by Jefferson to rally up the new country. The real aims the US had were to limit british involvement in US affairs, which britain continually did - such as kidnapping American citizens. The US managed to stop impressment, despite britain using napolean as an excuse. The US managed to invade canada, and show britain it couldn't push the US around and also managed to defeat the rise of the Indian empire, which britain tried to support in order to hurt the US. It wasn't 'fail' at all, the US won the war. There's no point denying it. I know it hurts to think that a small colony could have kicked britain's butt at the height of its empire, but lol.

The American Bill of Rights actually lifts whole passages from the English version and copies them as they are, which I find hilarious given how much certain right wing Americans think they invented everything democratic and liberal.

Wait what? I love America, I'm not attacking it just because I'm British but that's totally wrong. Firstly the USA wasn't almost as strong as Napoleon in Europe...nowhere near it. It nearly went bankrupt trying to fight the war in 1814, had a ton of hideous generals (Jackson aside), relied far too strongly on ill disciplined militias and generally got it's ass handed to it everywhere aside from New Orleans and in naval battles. The only reason Baltimore didn't fall was literally sheer luck. Admittedly in the naval battles the Americans gave a very good account of themselves.

The USA did want Canada, most of the primary actors on the American side mention it in the run up to the war and the American negotiators in Ghent were demanding it for most of the negotiations for peace. The USA did manage to invade Canada indeed but was sent scuttling out of Canada every single time, Benedict Arnold achieved more nearly thirty years earlier. Anyone can invade anywhere it proves nothing, it's actually successfully winning battles and occupying somewhere which proves something.

About the only thing you do have right is about the Indian lands but that was hardly important. The British just sold the Natives down the river as the British and Americans did throughout the 17th to 20th centuries.
 
 
 
No. Don't let him confuse you. The US created the world's first modern democracy with the world's first written constitution and bill of rights.

The magna carta propped up a monarchy, which is the exact opposite of a democracy. Before the US, every country was a monarchy. The US then inspired the French to revolt and the rest is history.

 

That's what I thought. Yes, it wasn't exactly equal rights, but then people had different morals back then.

 
I never said there weren't other motives in the final decision. William Wilberforce though campaigned for entirely moral reasons. The Royal Navy only captured slave ships for moral reasons, they otherwise gained little benefit from sailing around the Atlantic seeking conflict; there was no uprising to be feared from allowing other countries to trade.

It's a bit simplistic to say 'not long after', and you know that. It taken 50 more years, a civil war, and the might of the great Abraham Lincoln (a true American hero) to finally stamp slavery out.

 

Actually, Abraham Lincoln didn't abolish slavery on moral grounds. I find it hard to believe the other guy you mentioned did either.

 
Was it really the United States's path, though? If we look at some examples:

Women could vote in all US states in 1920. In Denmark it was 1915, in Finland it was 1906, in Australia it was 1908, in Norway it was 1913. The US was before many countries in this respect, but was it really leading the way?

The United States reached universal suffrage in 1964/1965 after the civil rights movement, as previously taxes and tests were used in southern states which were designed to specifically prevent black people from voting. In Norway, the right to prevent men from voting based on skin colour was completely removed in 1898, in New Zealand it was 1893, in Finland it was 1906, in Iceland it was 1882; before the Nazis, Germany had rather liberal voting laws and had full male suffrage in 1867. The US may have had Martin Luther King, but what needs to be realised is that the Scandinavian countries in particular didn't need a Martin Luther King figure in the first place.

Am I saying that the US was lagging behind? No, it was certainly no worse than France or the UK, but I'm simply rejecting the idea that the US was an uber-liberal country which was passing progressive laws giving the kind of liberty which left the rest of the world in its wake. That was not the case; the US neither led the way nor lagged behind. What actually happened was a slow move towards liberty and democracy throughout the western world.
 

All these countries were much smaller than the US, so of course it was easier and faster to change laws there. Maybe the US was slow to actually enact policies, but it always had these ideals in mind from its foundation. Just read the constitution.

 
It's just my opinion, but I see the effect of Manifest Destiny upon the native Americans being just as detrimental as the effects of the British in India or Ireland, or worse. I don't know how the kind of policy which led to  Wounded Knee , for example, could be described as especially favourable next to British imperialism, or the type that the home of democracy would promote. It wasn't the worst atrocity in history, no, but have Sweden ever done such a thing? The Danish? The Finnish? The Irish? The Belgians? The Polish? Maybe Britain was worse, but there are plenty of nations which have done even less than America. If you're trying to claim that America started modern democracy then it would help if it had a clean record with regards to actions towards people living within its borders (and not done things like Wounded Knee), like Sweden, Norway, etc; the US doesn't have that clean record.
 

I can see you are Italian, well the Romans weren't particularly good for the world, the catholic church? Mussolini? in fact, I'd say Italy is worse than britain in many ways. And yes, sweden, the netherlands, they all tried to establish empires and the things they did in Africa were atrocious tbh.

 
Up to now, your only defence of this suggestion has been to fling dirt at the policies of the British Empire, a rather easy task, but I never suggested that the Empire was the spreader of modern democracy either. My home country knows that better than anyone. Your opponent here isn't just Britain, you need to demonstrate how the US led the way for France, Sweden, New Zealand, Belgium, Denmark, Canada and all the rest too. It didn't.
 

Then why do so many countries have federal systems? That is based on the US political system.
 
 
 
The American Bill of Rights actually lifts whole passages from the English version and copies them as they are, which I find hilarious given how much certain right wing Americans think they invented everything democratic and liberal.

 

Indeed! (Maybe they should be done for plagarism!) I don't really see how the US Bill of Rights can count as democratic but not its British parent. There is no possible measure by which the US qualifies as the first democracy. It really staggers me, the confidence of the aforementioned group, that even when examples of pre-existing democracies are put forward, they are completely ignored. I'm certain that the goalposts will continue to be moved and the definition of 'democracy' rewritten until only the US fits the definition.

Very interesting post by you above also, I can't disagree with a word of it. I've just been reading a few quotes from Jefferson about annexing Canada; whatever their motivation, it's obvious that it was one of their aims. I think them marching into Canada is sufficient evidence of that!

The only reason Baltimore didn't fall was literally sheer luck. Admittedly in the naval battles the Americans gave a very good account of themselves.

 

The US was a strong nation, and I think it could have beaten britain entirely if it had wanted to, but it realized that it would be better to be allies instead of enemies.

Lol, the US didn't lose much. Sure, it lost a few battles, but britain lost in new york, baltimore, new orleans, plenty of places in canada.

Maybe that is because holding on to canada was more trouble than it was worth.

We lost at Plattsburgh (New York) because of a naval victory which threatened to cut off our supplies as we marched to Albany. I already explained that the American navy was pretty handy in the war.

We lost at New Orleans because of incredibly ridiculous planning, a lot of the regiments set off to assault a barricade and forget their siege ladders, there was a massive swamp on one side of the battlefield and the Generals involved didn't co-ordinate their assaults properly and had a propensity to get shot. It was the perfect way not to fight a battle by bad generals and had no impact on the war considering it was fought after the peace treaty so shouldn't be brought up in who 'won' the war. That being said we did lose the battle.

At Baltimore we were a lucky shot away from blowing up Fort McHenry and having Baltimore at our mercy. Indeed a few shells landed right by the main ammunition dump in McHenry and amazingly failed to explode. That's how ridiculously lucky Baltimore was. Tactically it was an American victory because we couldn't be bothered to keep wasting our time but it strategically it made no difference whatsoever.

So New Orleans is irrelevant, Baltimore wasn't strategically relevant and is entirely overshadowed by the burning of Washington D.C and only really Plattsburgh can be considered an important victory in the war. That being said Plattsburgh was very important. If that hadn't been won, New York City may (probably) have been occupied; with a British Army sat in New York City and Washington a smouldering ruin the British could have demanded anything they wanted. You can thank Plattsburgh for America coming out of the war with a draw rather than a defeat.
 
 
 
Actually, Abraham Lincoln didn't abolish slavery on moral grounds. I find it hard to believe the other guy you mentioned did either.

 

I'll concede that as I don't know enough about Lincoln to expand on his personal morality. What I've read of his life I've taken a liking to though.

 
All these countries were much smaller than the US, so of course it was easier and faster to change laws there. Maybe the US was slow to actually enact policies, but it always had these ideals in mind from its foundation. Just read the constitution.
 

They countries I mentioned still did it first though, so America led the way no more than the British Bill of Rights from 1689 did. Britain's population was higher than the US (until around 1830), so I could say that this too prevented them doing what they wanted to do, which was enact laws giving liberty. In reality, I know that isn't true, but the problem with suggestions of what governments ideally wanted to do underneath are very difficult to substantiate. It's equally possible that governments simply write into their constitutions statements that show freedom in principle, simply to keep them quiet and happy, while in practice they remain under the government's thumb.

The US is the biggest and most populous democracy to ever exist, I don't doubt it; comparisons with other nations are therefore impossible, so therefore to use its size as an excuse is to beg the question. Whatever its motives (though the Civil War, in my opinion, shows that the US had very mixed motives regarding the equality of black people), in practical terms it was behind most of Scandinavia. Actions really do speak louder than words. If only all America was always as progressive as the north-east coast was.

 
I can see you are Italian, well the Romans weren't particularly good for the world, the catholic church? Mussolini? in fact, I'd say Italy is worse than britain in many ways. And yes, sweden, the netherlands, they all tried to establish empires and the things they did in Africa were atrocious tbh.
 

Not Italian, I'm afraid. Similar flag, but with orange instead of red.  

Yes, the Dutch were colonial. The Swedish haven't been overly bad, nor the Belgians, the Danish and so on. The point remains that whilst the US haven't been too imperialistic, there remain countries which have been even less so.

 
Then why do so many countries have federal systems? That is based on the US political system.
 

I'm not sure, but it can trace lineage to the English counties, the states of Genoa, Venice, Milan and Pisa separate inside the Kingdom of Italy, the provinces of France, so it does have forebears of sorts.
 
 
 
It actually matters greatly how an objective is achieved when you're analysing who won a war. The British didn't stop impressment because the Americans made them, they did it because they wanted to.

The simple fact is that the USA came into the war with a couple objectives: 1. to gain respect of neutral shipping rights and stop impressment and 2. to conquer Canada.

In regards to the first issue the UK never respected neutral shipping rights throughout the war and the Americans never made them do so. It was a somewhat ridiculous idea to put forth in the first place, the Americans hilariously enough wanted to continue trading with France and giving the French the goods to continue fighting a war and for the British not to care based upon some ridiculous abstract concept of neutral rights, surprisingly the British ignored the Americans. Then again this was in the era when Jefferson wishy washy totally impractical abstract theories were actively put into practice, lets not forget the insane and devastating Embargo Acts leading up to the war.

In regards to the second point. Despite what you've said earlier in the thread, annexation of Canada was very important and if you read primary sources from nearly all the main actors on the American side they very much wanted to annex Canada. Jefferson claimed it was just a matter of marching into Canada with a few thousand men and taking it, not surprisingly he was proven wrong.

Thus America achieved none of her initial aims by military force. Likewise the British didn't really achieve any of their goals (as limited as they were - the British couldn't give a toss for the war and didn't want it, they were much more focused on Europe and just wanted the American thing over), the plan for an independent Indian nation blocking American expansion failed, they failed to gain exclusive use of the Great Lakes, they also failed to gain parts of Maine they wanted to annex.

Ipso facto neither side won the war. However the Treaty of Ghent cleaned up some past disagreements, the end of the Napoleonic Wars ended impressment and the two nations would grow closer and closer over the century. Thus both benefitted from the draw although the Native Americans got totally boned.

In regards to your initial point. The Canadian militia fighting alongside the British regulars are the forebearers of the Canadian nation, they came from the colonies of Upper and Lower Canada and played a huge role in defending the Canadas from the initial American invasions. While the oft mentioned idea that the Canadians burned Washington down is total rubbish (it was entirely British regulars) they still performed a very useful role in defending Canada. While they can't claim to have solely defeated the Americans in 1812-15 (it should be regarded as a draw) they can certainly share in the spoils of the war. It was incredibly important for developing the Canadian national identity, especially when the Canadian population at the time was a total mish mash of United Empire Loyalists who'd fled the States after the Revolution, new immigrants from the UK, old French Canadiens and a large population of recent American immigrants. It began the process of fusing them all into one culture and community and that's why it's so important for Canadians. It's exactly the same as the importance of the Revolution to the Americans.

 

You are incorrect. The US had only one objective - to gain respect and stop impressment. That was achieved and so the US was victorious. Conquering British North America was never America's objective. The US attacked the closest piece of the British Empire - Canada region - in order to protect it's sovereignty as a matter of national defense since the British was provoking with impressment.

There was no Canadian milita because Canada as a country did not exist until 1867.

Like I've said, you should build national identity on a foundation of truth, not mythology. The British colonist of America who eventually became the US took part in the 7 years war between the British and French, but America doesn't celebrate that war because our country never fought.
 
 
 
Ah, but my friend, you're the one claiming that the US was the "first modern democracy". How are you defining a modern democracy when you say that? By whatever measure you use, we'll see if I'm able to find a country that beat the US to it.

 

Name a democratic republic that existed in 1776 or 1787? The US is the first. before then the world was dominated by monarchies. The US lit the spark that changed that around.

 
In my opinion the best definition of 'modern democracy' is the right of anyone over 21 to vote (though preferably 18), and not discriminating based on gender or race. If we use that measure, New Zealand was first.

 

Hmm...facts verses opinion.

 
Are you suggesting that the US qualify for this title simply by having a Bill of Rights? England had one in  1689  and it's still in force to this day. San Marino, which as we have established has been a republic for 1,700 years, has had a constitution since  1600 . Why are neither of these qualifications for being a modern democracy, but the US's constitution was? What exact rights did the US constitution give that makes you believe it was the first modern democracy?

 

You're truly reaching. England is not a republic and was and still is a monarchy. A monarchy is the opposite of democracy. You're saying San Marino was a republic, so what kind was it? China claims to be a republic too.

 
'You're'? I'm neither English nor British.

I never said that the Magna Carta made England a democracy, it was just an example of a document which inspired the Founding Fathers (  see here  for an example of how it inspired them). In my opinion, Britain only became a true modern democracy in 1928.

 

Countries and people get inspired by many things. You can't be a true democracy unless you're a republic.

 
Again, that really depends on how you're defining "first modern democracy", as I've already demonstrated, the US was not the first to have a bill of rights.

 

You seem to not understand. Let me say it a different way - The US was the world's first democratic republic with the worlds first written constitution and bill of rights.
 
 
 
The war of 1812 was over British impressment or kidnapping of US merchant sailors. I think the US has more of a right to claim victory because we achieved everything we intended and won the battle of new orleans, which was the last major battle.

My main confusion is why are Canadians using a war that they never fought for their on patriotic purposes.

This is like if the US took the British and French 7 Years war and annually celebrated a victory for the US over the British, when in reality the British were more victorious over the French and the US wasn't even a country when it occurred.

 

Hey my ancestors fought the war, Canada's ancestors fought the war, so **** yeah WE fought. And the US unsuccessfully tried to expand their land and "annex Canada". The Treaty of Ghent, which was signed by both parties, had the British Empire giving back 10 million acres of land it conquered in the war in exchange for parts of Ontario. You have a right to claim victory? Get a goddamn history book. It was a stalemate, and Britain was happy to call it a truce since they were busy fighting Napoleon.

You are confused, I'll give you that. But you insult our family trees that bravely and successfully defended our land from you and I'll have to remind you that it thanks to the French that you won your independence at all.
 
 
 
The examples aren't the same. Canada was not a government entity during the 1812 war. Scotland was a government entity before joining the British Empire and after.

 

The colonies did have some form of government. It wasn't a single government entity as what's now called Canada was made up of separate colonies, but they had their own governments. Scotland actually didn't have it's own government while in the UK until devolution happened in 1998.

 
Christmas is not an American born holiday but Americans celebrate it.

Easter is not an American born Holiday but Americans celebrate it.

Halloween is not an American born holiday but Americans celebrate it.

Canadians are claiming the 1812 war for Canada and rewriting history to say "we defeated the US"

 

The impression I get is that Thanksgiving is considered an American holiday (I know other countries have holidays also called Thanksgiving, but they have different stories behind them). As in Americans take "credit" for the story. But I suppose you're right, it's not quite the same. Either way, the war of 1812 is clearly a part of Canada's history, more so than any other part of the former British Empire.

 
THe US fought the British Empire not Canada because Canada did not exist.

 

But the places that now make up Canada did exist. Including Upper and Lower Canada.

 
I'm aware that Napoleon was defeated during the 1812 war. But you still don't understand -- What does it matter how a objective was achieved? As long is the problem is no longer a problem, then the objective was achieved. Impressment of US sailors was no longer occurring after the war, therefore the US chalks it up as objective achieved. Britain on the other hand was the instigator before the war, and stopped instigating after the war, which is why the British lost. If Britain hadn't lost, they would have kept doing exactly what they were doing before the war - instigating, bullying, and impressment.

 

I sort of agree with you. In that aspect, America "won" but only because they were lucky. It's like someone else won the war for them. Although it's weird that it was their enemy that won the war for them. I suppose in reality it was probably a combination of things that ended impressment. After the war ended with Napoleon it wasn't worth the effort of fighting the Americans to keep doing it. For all we know they might have carried on with it if America hadn't attacked British territory.

 
You're truly reaching. England is not a republic and was and still is a monarchy. A monarchy is the opposite of democracy. You're saying San Marino was a republic, so what kind was it? China claims to be a republic too.

 

A monarchy is not the opposite of a democracy. A constitutional monarchy can be democratic because the monarch is a figurehead that doesn't actually have power. The body that actually runs the country, makes laws, etc. is a democratically elected government. The monarch cannot in reality overrule them. It's mostly monarchies that dominate the top of the democracy index (although the UK isn't in the top 10).

Also a republic doesn't necessarily have to be a democracy. A republic is just a state that is not ruled by a monarch. That doesn't mean the head of state has to be democratically elected. I think China is legitimately a republic because the leadership isn't passed down family lines as far as I know. Although North Korea calling itself a Democratic Republic clearly is taking the ****  
 
 
Blame Canada,
Blame Canada.......
 
 
 
I don't think you understand how this works. When something from one something enters another country (whether it be a person or thing), and there's no previous agreement, then the other country has no obligation to return it. The same way if US technology get's into the hands of the Chinese, the Chinese don't have to return it. Or if the Chinese detain a US citizen, the Chinese don't have to release them. This is why what you're saying makes no sense.

 

That's a gross misunderstanding of 'how things worked' back then. America was harbouring British fugitives, plain and simple. Britain wanted them back. Britain got them back. It's as simply as that. This was 1812, not 2012.

 
I'm aware that Napoleon was defeated during the 1812 war. But you still don't understand -- What does it matter how a objective was achieved? As long is the problem is no longer a problem, then the objective was achieved. Impressment of US sailors was no longer occurring after the war, therefore the US chalks it up as objective achieved..

 

Of course it matters, when you go around phrasing it as 'The US taught Britain a lesson' or 'The US forced Britain to end impressment.' I want you to admit that the United States had no bearing on Britain's decision to end impressment and that it tried but failed to gain any concessions regarding impressment during the Treaty of Ghent. It also failed on both counts regarding the British blockade.

 
Britain on the other hand was the instigator before the war, and stopped instigating after the war, which is why the British lost. If Britain hadn't lost, they would have kept doing exactly what they were doing before the war - instigating, bullying, and impressment.

 

No, America was the instigator of the war. It invaded Canada. Both sides got weary of what was an ultimately pointless war and called to make peace.
When the war ended, America had all but been turfed out of Canada and was fighting off a British invasion of your mainland. The Royal Navy blockade was choking your economy. Britain had a larger population and economy. In fact, the only damage the Americans inflicted upon Britain was a small spike in shipping premiums. Get this delusional image, that America was on the verge of victory and forced Britain to the negotiation table, out of your head.
I mean seriously, will you and DYKWIA actually read the Treaty of Ghent? Nothing at all was achieved by either side. No territory changed hands. No concessions were made, regarding impressment, the blockade or apparently 'bullying'. You Americans must be completely devoud of ambition if you claim that as a victory.
 
 
 
Ever heard of the 'many headed hydra' description of the workforce, in reference to the fact that quelling rebellion is hard? They most certainly were worried about laborers teaming up (slaves and indentured servants).

I'm not making facts up.

 

Ever head of relevance? Quelling rebellion is hard. Britain would know, it just fought the revolutionary war in America.
However: It did not fear that a slave revolt was going to break out in the West Indies. You are in fact making that up.
Why don't you actually read up on William Wilberforce and the abolitionist movement before coming out with such waffle?
 
 
 
I don't think you can suggest that the US fighting back was a small issue for the british. The US was almost as strong a force as napolean in europe, it's just that the USA was further away from britain and didn't want to conquer britain.

 

What did I say? You Yanks are delusional.
Are you actually comparing the American army of 1815 to Napoleon's Grand Armee? Seriously? The American army that had been turfed out of Canada by militia and reserves? Seriously? On your bike son.

 
America didn't want to annex canada - it was some rhetoric used by Jefferson to rally up the new country.

 

What's you point? America still invaded Canada and failed.

 
The real aims the US had were to limit british involvement in US affairs, which britain continually did - such as kidnapping American citizens. The US managed to stop impressment, despite britain using napolean as an excuse.

 

Once again, when impressment was ended, America had been turfed out of Canada. Britain had shipped over three new armies and dozens of warships over to North America. The United States was firmly on the back foot. Can you actually comprehend that? Why on earth would Britain concede when the momentum was in their favour? Unless, possible, maybe, the entire reason that impressment was introduced in the first place, the Napoleonic wars, had ended. Why hadn't Britain ended the blockade then? Riddle me that, mister Yank? Or just ignore it because it doesn't fit into your silly viewpoint, as you always do.

 
The US managed to invade canada, and show britain it couldn't push the US around and also managed to defeat the rise of the Indian empire, which britain tried to support in order to hurt the US. It wasn't 'fail' at all, the US won the war. There's no point denying it. I know it hurts to think that a small colony could have kicked britain's butt at the height of its empire, but lol.

 

The US managed to invade Canada? Canada was wilderness! It was sparsely populated and the border was undefended. Congratulations! Tell me, how did that invasion end? That's right, America got spanked by militia! You were beaten back by the British reserve team. My word, you Yanks are insane! You just can't accept that you've ever lost a war, can you?
 
 
 
Whose fault is that? Do you know how war works? Should America have waited for Britain to get ready first?  

THe US fought the British Empire not Canada because Canada did not exist.

 

But the US fought Canadians and the Canadians were the underdogs now screw you and goodbye.

Countries and people get inspired by many things. You can't be a true democracy unless you're a republic.

 

I can't fully answer that question until you tell me what demands you expect of a democratic republic ? You say my opinion of what constitutes a democracy as 'just an opinion', which is true, but the same is true of your own opinion, yet thus far you have simply assumed your definition is fact and won't even elaborate on it.

Are you using the definition that a democratic republic is a nation in which its political representatives are fully elected? If you accept this definition, then I can give republics (where representatives were fully elected) from those years which fit your criteria:

The  Dutch Republic  1581-1795
 San Marino  301-Present Day

Also worth an honourable mention:

The  Corsican Republic  1755-1769 (Sadly got invaded by the French 7 years before the American Declaration of Independence.)

 
You seem to not understand. Let me say it a different way - The US was the world's first democratic republic with the worlds first written constitution and bill of rights.
 

Ok, so the republic in question must have a constitution too?

San Marino has one (see  here , written 1600), as did the Dutch Republic (see a discussion of it in the early chapter of the History paragraph  here , it was written in 1579), and, you guessed it, the Corsican Republic had a  constitution  too, written in 1755.

San Marino and the Dutch Republic confederal republics, the Corsian Republic was a constitutional republic, seeing as you asked.

Now, again, by what criteria was the US the first 'democratic republic'? Are you planning instead to use my earlier definition that it depends on voting rights? Because the US wasn't first there either. It's ironic that in the OP you accuse the Canadians of rewriting history, when the only example of rewriting history that I can see here is the assertion of the US that it was the first democratic republic.
 
 
"We burned this **** town down in 1814 and ahm all fer doin it again."

Iceland's parliament is still in use and was founded in 930 AD. Switzerland has had a federal direct democracy since 1322.

I think the two are vaguely comparable, let's not forget that the US didn't want to hold on to Canada once it realized that the people there didn't want to be American. No one was 'turfed out' of Canada. The US left. If the US had wanted to hurt britain it could have done so.

We left Canada, we weren't kicked out. The US never wanted to take over Canada, it was simply an effort to flex muscle at the British to stop them getting involved in our politics and taking US citizens.

Britain won a few battles, I agree with that, but don't get ahead of yourself - in no way did we lose. We managed to stop the Indians, the british and the spanish. Britain quickly realized that it couldn't handle the USA so it decided, wisely, to ally itself with the US.

Also, you keep saying the US must have had no ambition because it didn't wanna conquer canada, but you would hardly say the allies didn't win WWII simply because no land was gained. The US didn't gain land there either.
 
 
 
I think the two are vaguely comparable,

 

If by vaguely, you mean not all in any sense. Napoleon's Grand Armee at it's height numbered 600,000 men, was a veteran battle hardened force that conquered half of Europe and was only defeated by a coalition of the other half, on the seventh attempt at that. The US army during the war of 1812 was a rag tag force that numbered 36,000 and struggled against British militia.

 
let's not forget that the US didn't want to hold on to Canada once it realized that the people there didn't want to be American. No one was 'turfed out' of Canada. The US left. If the US had wanted to hurt britain it could have done so.

We left Canada, we weren't kicked out. The US never wanted to take over Canada, it was simply an effort to flex muscle at the British to stop them getting involved in our politics and taking US citizens.

 

Sure, America voluntarily left Canada. It had absolutely nothing to do with the defeats the US army suffered at the battles of Odelltown, Lacolle Mills, Lundy's Lane and Cook's Mill just prior to their withdrawal, or the fact that their supplies lines had been cut by British control of the St. Lawrence river.  
Next you'll be telling me that the Iraqi's voluntarily withdrew from Kuwait during the Gulf War.

If you actually bothered to study the war, which you evidently haven't, you'll see that the British won thirteen major battles, compared with eleven American victories. Managing to 'stop' Britain's invasion of America would be all well and dandy if wasn't preceded by a disastrous failed invasion of Canada. America earned some credit at the end, I'll give you that, but it doesn't qualify as a victory.

 
Also, you keep saying the US must have had no ambition because it didn't wanna conquer canada, but you would hardly say the allies didn't win WWII simply because no land was gained. The US didn't gain land there either.

 

No, I keep saying that the US must have had no ambition because you and drknoble are claiming victory when only one out of three objectives was met. They defeated the Native American confederacy, but they failed to break the British blockade or gain concessions regarding impressment. Me personally, I'd say that one out of three is a failure.
 
 
 
As for "lighting the spark"... You are aware that the French Revolution happened BEFORE the American one, and that the American Revolution was inspired by principles of the French Revolution?

 

Think you got your dates mixed up there a bit. The US revolution began in 1776, the French one in 1789. However neither were 'inspired' by the other. Humans have been revolting against each other since the dawn of time. The only things these two revolutions have in similarity is that they both happened in the same century.

Sorry, my bad.

In any case, it is true that the American Revolution was inspired by values that had come out of the French enlightenment, a so-called "philosophical revolution."

Yes, the US suffered a few military defeats, but it never showed any real interest in maintaining control of Canada, it was about getting the British to leave the US alone.

I've studied it, although you seem to have a very different view of the war from reality. Numbers of battles aren't relevant as different battles had different levels of importance on the war. Britain did earn some credit during the war (like burning washington   ), but it doesn't qualify as a victory.

Either way you look at it, impressment stopped and the US was not heavily affected by the blockade. So it didn't fail there. Also, the US managed to get britain to leave the US alone, so it won there too.
 
 
 
Sorry, my bad.

 

Or attempting to win the argument by making stuff up.

 
In any case, it is true that the American Revolution was inspired by values that had come out of the French enlightenment, a so-called "philosophical revolution."
 

No, it was inspired by a people's need to be free from Imperial control, it didn't have much to do with the french, apart from the fact they lent some support in the gaining of independence.

No, I genuinely got my dates mixed up, for which I apologize.

The values of freedom and equality, which were completely different from anything society had had up till then, came from the philosophical revolution that took place, for the most part, in France and other parts of Europe. Secularism, for example, a huge part of what makes the American constitution truly revolutionary, came from the work of Voltaire and Spinoza.
 
 
 
It's not all about numbers. There is also the issue of the skill and training of the American army, which you seem to forget about.

 

In terms of skill and training, you have the US army, that was turfed out of Canada by British militia. Then you have the French Grand Armee, which ran riot for 16 years, conquering half of Europe in the bloodiest conflict ever up to that point and was only defeated fighting seven vast coalitions. Come on, the game is up on this point. I honestly believe that not even you are that delusional.

 
Yes, the US suffered a few military defeats, but it never showed any real interest in maintaining control of Canada, it was about getting the British to leave the US alone.

 

Come off it, the term war-hawk originated from American politicians who wanted to conquer Canada. Face it, you lost and were turfed out. And if it was solely about getting the British to leave the US alone, you failed on the count too, because shortly after turfing you out of Canada, it sent over three armies to invade America. Good work, American Army!  

 
I've studied it, although you seem to have a very different view of the war from reality. Numbers of battles aren't relevant as different battles had different levels of importance on the war. Britain did earn some credit during the war (like burning washington   ), but it doesn't qualify as a victory.

 

Let's look at the reality: Britain kicked the US out of Canada. It then invaded the US. By the time the war ended Britain still occupied 40,000 square km of land it's Royal Navy was choking the US economy. Those are the facts. But no, ofcourse not, America won, just because  

 
Either way you look at it, impressment stopped and the US was not heavily affected by the blockade. So it didn't fail there. Also, the US managed to get britain to leave the US alone, so it won there too.

 

Either way you look at it, the US failed to get concessions regarding impressment and failed to deal with the blockade. US actions during the war played absolutely no part in the matter. The US national debt tripled, it's economy was faltering. Britain was the nation that achieved it's goals- to defend Canada.
 
 
 
No, it was inspired by a people's need to be free from Imperial control, it didn't have much to do with the french, apart from the fact they lent some support in the gaining of independence.

 

Come off it, the US revolution was bourne out of a desire to avoid paying taxes. America was founded by tax evaders, and by the looks of things, your current elite are doing their best to follow in the footsteps of the founding fathers.

Okay, but I think it is suspect to say the US army wasn't better trained. As you yourself stated, the napolean's army was almost 20 times larger.

Which it couldn't do, since it was forced to the table to make peace. The british were also warmongering elsewhere in the world and couldn't afford to try and fight a war against the US.

[/QUOTE]

The US also achieved its goals, to survive british, spanish and indian imperialism against it. Also, you say the US economy was faltering yet in just over 100 years it would become the biggest economy in the world. After the war of 1812 the US was free to expand west and really the blockade had little impact on the USA.
 
 
 
Come off it, the US revolution was bourne out of a desire to avoid paying taxes. America was founded by tax evaders, and by the looks of things, your current elite are doing their best to follow in the footsteps of the founding fathers.

 

That's cynical. People didn't mind paying taxes, the issue was paying taxes to a government thousands of miles away who refused to allow the American colonies representation.

I support low taxation actually. I think a freer market leads to a more efficient and more productive economy.
 
 
 
You are incorrect. The US had only one objective - to gain respect and stop impressment. That was achieved and so the US was victorious. Conquering British North America was never America's objective. The US attacked the closest piece of the British Empire - Canada region - in order to protect it's sovereignty as a matter of national defense since the British was provoking with impressment.

There was no Canadian milita because Canada as a country did not exist until 1867.

Like I've said, you should build national identity on a foundation of truth, not mythology. The British colonist of America who eventually became the US took part in the 7 years war between the British and French, but America doesn't celebrate that war because our country never fought.

 

If you're going to attempt to troll at least get your facts right. The USA wanted Canada from the start, the primary sources state it, Jefferson stated it, the US negotiators at Ghent demanded it for much of the negotiations.

Impressment wasn't stopped because of the Americans, it was stopped because of the end of the Napoleonic Wars (100 days aside).

Canada did exist...as two colonies of Lower and Upper Canada. It wasn't sovereign but it existed as a colony. I think you'll find that the French and Indian War is actually well remembered in America, especially in regions such as Pittsburgh (Fort Duquesne/Pitt is the modern site of downtown Pittsburgh, the Monongahela battle site isn't too far away) and upstate New York. George Washington fought in the French and Indian War. I assume he can't be considered American or do we have to just pretend that he never fought in that war?

Anything else you want correcting?  
 
 
Impressment as the reason for the war?! lol come off it - the US saw an opportunity to take Canada from the weak British and failed to do so, losing its capital in the process. The video they give at the Capitol building is hilariously biased in this respect. As is the wikipedia article - great emphasis is given to the american historians claiming it wasn't an aim, but not the accounts of the time saying that the US was expecting local support, and were surprised when they didn't get it.

The US was always going to grow far larger than Britain or Canada could ever hope to be. The war of 1812 didn't change anything other than to continue Canada's survival.
 
 
 
Okay, but I think it is suspect to say the US army wasn't better trained. As you yourself stated, the napolean's army was almost 20 times larger.

 

The fact that the US army failed to take on British militia in Canada, I think it's fair to say the the US army was no where near the standards of the Grand Armee, be it overall or man for man.

 
Which it couldn't do, since it was forced to the table to make peace. The british were also warmongering elsewhere in the world and couldn't afford to try and fight a war against the US.

 

The British weren't 'forced' to make peace, no more than the Yanks were.

 
You say 'kicked out', I say we left. It doesn't really make a difference which it was.

 

Yes it does, doubly so when you stubbornly refuse to accept the truth. The Americans were forced off of the territory they occupied in Canada after being beaten in battle by the British. The only position America voluntary left was Fort Eirie.

 
The US also achieved its goals, to survive british, spanish and indian imperialism against it.

 

Britain and the 'Indians' had no intention of committing 'imperialism' against the United States, so the point is mute. Impressment and the blockade were a means of fighting the Napoleonic wars, not as a means of shafting America. Britain's sole aim during the war was to protect Canada. The Native Americans wanted the Yanks to stop encroaching on their lands. Stopping something from happening that in fact was not happening anyway isn't much of an achievement.

 
Also, you say the US economy was faltering yet in just over 100 years it would become the biggest economy in the world. After the war of 1812 the US was free to expand west and really the blockade had little impact on the USA.

 

The US economy was faltering during the war you doughnut. I know it recovered after the war, what's your point? Japan's recovered after WW2. That doesn't give any indication of how it fared during the actual war. The US importation acts damaged America more than Britain, and New England was close to mutiny over the blockade issue. The US was near broke by 1815, it was being forced to issue worthless paper bonds to fund the war and the national debt had tripled. That doesn't sound like 'little impact' to me.
 
 
 
That's cynical. People didn't mind paying taxes, the issue was paying taxes to a government thousands of miles away who refused to allow the American colonies representation.

 

The UK defended the colonies from the French during the Seven Year war. The taxes were instituted to recoup that cost. They had a duty to pay regardless of representation in Parliament.

 
I support low taxation actually. I think a freer market leads to a more efficient and more productive economy.

 

If you have a surplus then by all means cut taxes. But the United States doesn't. The Bush tax cuts were beyond ridiculous considering the state of your nations finances.
 
 
 
If you're going to attempt to troll at least get your facts right. The USA wanted Canada from the start, the primary sources state it, Jefferson stated it, the US negotiators at Ghent demanded it for much of the negotiations.

Impressment wasn't stopped because of the Americans, it was stopped because of the end of the Napoleonic Wars (100 days aside).

 

Maybe we should just agree that it was for both reasons.

 
Canada did exist...as two colonies of Lower and Upper Canada. It wasn't sovereign but it existed as a colony. I think you'll find that the French and Indian War is actually well remembered in America, especially in regions such as Pittsburgh (Fort Duquesne/Pitt is the modern site of downtown Pittsburgh, the Monongahela battle site isn't too far away) and upstate New York. George Washington fought in the French and Indian War. I assume he can't be considered American or do we have to just pretend that he never fought in that war?
 

Kinda, but most people consider it to be britain vs france, not USA vs france or even much colonists vs france.
 
 
 
The fact that the US army failed to take on British militia in Canada, I think it's fair to say the the US army was no where near the standards of the Grand Armee, be it overall or man for man.

 

I don't think so.

 
The British weren't 'forced' to make peace, no more than the Yanks were.
 

It was strongly in britain's interests to make peace, you couldn't afford to have a war on another front against an enemy that was willing to fight back.

 
Yes it does, doubly so when you stubbornly refuse to accept the truth. The Americans were forced off of the territory they occupied in Canada after being beaten in battle by the British. The only position America voluntary left was Fort Eirie.
 

No, I stubbornly refuse to accept your biased views of the past. Maybe you should actually read an overview of the war:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812 . You have it completely wrong. What about places in canada like Ontario?

 
Britain and the 'Indians' had no intention of committing 'imperialism' against the United States, so the point is mute.

You yourself stated that the british wanted to invade the US. They only stopped when they realized they would fail if they tried.

I admit that war wasn't good for the US' economy, but the fact remains that it allowed the US to prosper afterwards.
 
 
 
I don't think so.

 

Are you actually, seriously, with a straight face, telling me that you think the US army of 1815 was comparable with the Grand Armee, man for man? Napoleon's legendary Grand Armee? Or are you thinking of another one?

 
It was strongly in britain's interests to make peace, you couldn't afford to have a war on another front

 

Funny then that Britain didn't fold when the US invaded Canada in the first place in 1812.

 
against an enemy that was willing to fight back.

 

What are you implying, that the UK only fought nations that didn't fight back? You do realise at this time the UK was involved in the Napoleonic wars, right?

 
No, I stubbornly refuse to accept your biased views of the past.

 

Your calling my views biased? Holy cow! The US suffered a series of military reversals, shortly after those units pulled out of Canada, yet you say that they did it voluntarily, and your calling me biased?

 
Maybe you should actually read an overview of the war:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812 . You have it completely wrong. What about places in canada like Ontario?

 

What about Ontario?
And have you yourself even read the page? How about where it says

However, other scholars hold that the war constituted a British victory and an American defeat. They argue that the British achieved their military objectives in 1812 (by stopping the repeated American invasions of Canada) and that Canada retained her independence of the United States. By contrast, they say, the Americans suffered a defeat when their armies failed to achieve their war goal of seizing part or all of Canada. Additionally, they argue the US lost as it failed to stop impressment, which the British refused to repeal until the end of the Napoleonic Wars, and the US actions had no effect on the orders in council, which were rescinded before the war started

 
You yourself stated that the british wanted to invade the US. They only stopped when they realized they would fail if they tried.

 

If they tried? They did try and fared infinately better than the disastrous US invasion of Canada. The British still occupied over 40,000 sq km of land when the war ended. Do you even know anything about this conflict?

 
I admit that war wasn't good for the US' economy, but the fact remains that it allowed the US to prosper afterwards.

 

The war didn't allow the US to prosper after. The war itself achieved nothing!
 
 
 
...

 

Okay, fine, britain didn't lose entirely - you've made some good points, even if they are biased. i still think we can say it was a victory for the US, and maybe britain can claim that it won because it was able to become a better ally of the US.

You want to talk about biased?
Why don't re-read this post? Seriously, read it.
First you say 'Britain didn't lose entirely.'
No, Britain didn't lose at all. They conceded nothing and gave up no territory.
Then you say 'maybe britain can claim that it won because it was able to become a better ally of the US' What on Earth is this tripe? Don't flatter yourselves. Britain can claim it won because, as above, they conceded nothing and gave up no territory.

So Germany and Japan also won WW2?  

I see your point though. From reading up on Wikipedia, it seems the British realised they had more to gain by cooperating with the US than fighting them. But they didn't have to give anything up to end the war either.

Isn't it a bit pointless arguing about who won the war? Neither side lost or gained anything by the end of it.
 
 
 
If you call having -- the world's largest economy, world's strongest military, world's most influential politics, world's reserve currency, world's best universities, world's best technology(went to the moon) with the world's best tech companies: Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, etc., world's most influential culture with the world's most successful entertainment industry -- being a cocaine dealer, then you must seriously be on crack cocaine.

Plus, Canada is the UK offspring. The US created itself via revolution.

 

It was merely a reflection of how the rest of the world views American arrogance.

Which you have so amply demonstrated.
 
 
 
Hey my ancestors fought the war, Canada's ancestors fought the war, so **** yeah WE fought. And the US unsuccessfully tried to expand their land and "annex Canada". The Treaty of Ghent, which was signed by both parties, had the British Empire giving back 10 million acres of land it conquered in the war in exchange for parts of Ontario. You have a right to claim victory? Get a goddamn history book. It was a stalemate, and Britain was happy to call it a truce since they were busy fighting Napoleon.

You are confused, I'll give you that. But you insult our family trees that bravely and successfully defended our land from you and I'll have to remind you that it thanks to the French that you won your independence at all.

 

Ancestors   That makes no sense. Your "ancestors" also built the Roman Empire, so do claim and celebrate that? Your ancestors also use to live in caves.

It wasn't a stalmate because the US achieved it objective which was to protect its sovereignty which the British were threatening.
 
 
 
The colonies did have some form of government. It wasn't a single government entity as what's now called Canada was made up of separate colonies, but they had their own governments. Scotland actually didn't have it's own government while in the UK until devolution happened in 1998.

 

But it wasn't the government of Canada.

 
The impression I get is that Thanksgiving is considered an American holiday (I know other countries have holidays also called Thanksgiving, but they have different stories behind them). As in Americans take "credit" for the story. But I suppose you're right, it's not quite the same. Either way, the war of 1812 is clearly a part of Canada's history, more so than any other part of the former British Empire.

 

Canadians celebrate Thanksgiving too. There's a difference between holidays and fabricating history.

 
But the places that now make up Canada did exist. Including Upper and Lower Canada.

 

But Canada wasn't a gov. entity, it was all part of the British Empire. Some places that now make up the US exist, but we don't celebrate the 7 years war because the government via the military of the United States of America never took part.

 
I sort of agree with you. In that aspect, America "won" but only because they were lucky. It's like someone else won the war for them. Although it's weird that it was their enemy that won the war for them. I suppose in reality it was probably a combination of things that ended impressment. After the war ended with Napoleon it wasn't worth the effort of fighting the Americans to keep doing it. For all we know they might have carried on with it if America hadn't attacked British territory.

 

America won in the US revolutionary war and then the 1812 war, I wouldn't call two victories in a row luck.

 
A monarchy is not the opposite of a democracy. A constitutional monarchy can be democratic because the monarch is a figurehead that doesn't actually have power. The body that actually runs the country, makes laws, etc. is a democratically elected government. The monarch cannot in reality overrule them. It's mostly monarchies that dominate the top of the democracy index (although the UK isn't in the top 10).

 

Monarchy is the direct opposite of democracy. Democracy is will of the people via voting. Monarchy is will of one. A constitutional monarchy can never be a true democracy. The Fact that the monarchy can never be removed in the name of "tradition" is a direct contradiction to democracy.

 
Also a republic doesn't necessarily have to be a democracy. A republic is just a state that is not ruled by a monarch. That doesn't mean the head of state has to be democratically elected. I think China is legitimately a republic because the leadership isn't passed down family lines as far as I know. Although North Korea calling itself a Democratic Republic clearly is taking the ****  

 

You can't be a true republic unless you're democracy, and you can't be a true democracy unless you're a republic.
 
 
 
That's a gross misunderstanding of 'how things worked' back then. America was harbouring British fugitives, plain and simple. Britain wanted them back. Britain got them back. It's as simply as that. This was 1812, not 2012.

 

You still don't get it. They were the same. Fact of the matter is the British were kidnapping US citizens knowingly provoking a war.

 
Of course it matters, when you go around phrasing it as 'The US taught Britain a lesson' or 'The US forced Britain to end impressment.' I want you to admit that the United States had no bearing on Britain's decision to end impressment and that it tried but failed to gain any concessions regarding impressment during the Treaty of Ghent. It also failed on both counts regarding the British blockade.

 

The US did teach the British a lesson of don't threaten US sovereignty.

 
No, America was the instigator of the war. It invaded Canada. Both sides got weary of what was an ultimately pointless war and called to make peace.
When the war ended, America had all but been turfed out of Canada and was fighting off a British invasion of your mainland. The Royal Navy blockade was choking your economy. Britain had a larger population and economy. In fact, the only damage the Americans inflicted upon Britain was a small spike in shipping premiums. Get this delusional image, that America was on the verge of victory and forced Britain to the negotiation table, out of your head.
I mean seriously, will you and DYKWIA actually read the Treaty of Ghent? Nothing at all was achieved by either side. No territory changed hands. No concessions were made, regarding impressment, the blockade or apparently 'bullying'. You Americans must be completely devoud of ambition if you claim that as a victory.

 

Obviously Britain was the instigator of the war by threatening US sovereignty with impressment. Name one country that would allow something like impressment?
 
 
 
But the US fought Canadians and the Canadians were the underdogs now screw you and goodbye.

 

There was no "Canadian" nationality until 1867. The US fought the British.
 
 
 
I can't fully answer that question until you tell me what demands you expect of a democratic republic ? You say my opinion of what constitutes a democracy as 'just an opinion', which is true, but the same is true of your own opinion, yet thus far you have simply assumed your definition is fact and won't even elaborate on it.

Are you using the definition that a democratic republic is a nation in which its political representatives are fully elected? If you accept this definition, then I can give republics (where representatives were fully elected) from those years which fit your criteria:

The  Dutch Republic  1581-1795
 San Marino  301-Present Day

Also worth an honourable mention:

The  Corsican Republic  1755-1769 (Sadly got invaded by the French 7 years before the American Declaration of Independence.)

Ok, so the republic in question must have a constitution too?

San Marino has one (see  here , written 1600), as did the Dutch Republic (see a discussion of it in the early chapter of the History paragraph  here , it was written in 1579), and, you guessed it, the Corsican Republic had a  constitution  too, written in 1755.

San Marino and the Dutch Republic confederal republics, the Corsian Republic was a constitutional republic, seeing as you asked.

Now, again, by what criteria was the US the first 'democratic republic'? Are you planning instead to use my earlier definition that it depends on voting rights? Because the US wasn't first there either. It's ironic that in the OP you accuse the Canadians of rewriting history, when the only example of rewriting history that I can see here is the assertion of the US that it was the first democratic republic.

 

Firstly, linking to wikipedia pages with "republic" in its title doesn't prove they were republics, nor do they prove they were democratic. The Dutch republic doesn't exist and wasn't democratic as many of the seats were hereditary.

 link 

 
There was a constant power struggle between the Orangists, who supported the stadtholders and specifically the House of Orange-Nassau, and the Republicans, who supported the States-General and hoped to replace the semi-hereditary nature of the stadtholdership with a true republican structure.
 

San Marino didn't have the first written constitution with a bill of rights. It's "constitution" is a collection of laws and books. Some British call their collection of laws a constitution, but it's not.
 
 
 
Iceland's parliament is still in use and was founded in 930 AD. Switzerland has had a federal direct democracy since 1322.

As for "lighting the spark"... You are aware that the French Revolution happened BEFORE the American one, and that the American Revolution was inspired by principles of the French Revolution?

 

I don't believe those were democratic republics with a written constitution and bill of rights.

You do know the US revolution (1775-1783) was before the French revolution (1789-1799) right?
 
 
 
If you're going to attempt to troll at least get your facts right. The USA wanted Canada from the start, the primary sources state it, Jefferson stated it, the US negotiators at Ghent demanded it for much of the negotiations.

Impressment wasn't stopped because of the Americans, it was stopped because of the end of the Napoleonic Wars (100 days aside).

Canada did exist...as two colonies of Lower and Upper Canada. It wasn't sovereign but it existed as a colony. I think you'll find that the French and Indian War is actually well remembered in America, especially in regions such as Pittsburgh (Fort Duquesne/Pitt is the modern site of downtown Pittsburgh, the Monongahela battle site isn't too far away) and upstate New York. George Washington fought in the French and Indian War. I assume he can't be considered American or do we have to just pretend that he never fought in that war?

Anything else you want correcting?  

 

You are amazingly ironic.

The US never wanted the British territory Canada. The war of 1812 was about protecting US sovereignty which was being threatened by British bullying and impressment. The British provoked the young and weak US to the point where they had no choice but to take action or risk becoming a target for invasion. The US attacked the closest British territory, was victorious in securing its sovereignty, and the rest is history.
 
 
Using the impressment argument as the most important factor in the War of 1812 is just as myopic as claiming it was an argument over slavery that caused the American Civil War.
 
 
Quick Q; if the US army was so skilful then why did it fail to win one war against Britain's reserve forces while Britain fought two wars?

I advise you read Bill Bryson's Made in America. It's an interesting read not only about American language but its history too. I'd pay attention to him too; they didn't make him the chancellor of Durham University for nothing. For the record it doesn't cover the 1812 war.
 
 
 
It was merely a reflection of how the rest of the world views American arrogance.

Which you have so amply demonstrated.

 

Besides America's enemies like North Korea. Most countries of the World view America in a good light. Only few like yourself are troubled by the fact that the US is currently the top dog. I'm sure there were people who were sour when the British Empire was at the top spot. It comes with the territory.
 
 
 
Using the impressment argument as the most important factor in the War of 1812 is just as myopic as claiming it was an argument over slavery that caused the American Civil War.

 

Wow.You are truly confused. The US Civil was ONLY about slavery. I guess WW2 wasn't about Germany invading  

The 1812 war was about protecting US sovereignty which was being threatened by British impressment.

The USA did win. Britain failed to invade the USA; it failed to prop up a puppet indian empire; the US stopped impressment and the US won a lot of battles against britain.

San Marino didn't have the first written constitution with a bill of rights. It's "constitution" is a collection of laws and books. Some British call their collection of laws a constitution, but it's not.

 

I see that you still haven't defined ' democratic republic', I'll give you one more chance, else I have better things to do than sit here going around in circles, and I'm sure the same goes for you too.

I'll accept your problems with the Dutch system, but I'm sorry your refutation of the San Marino system is desperate at best. Its system was a series of laws which defined the powers of the people and the state, and included those laid out in a series of books. As the Oxford English Dictionary defines a constitution as:

 
A body of principles according to which a state or organisation is governed
 

San Marino therefore had a constitution, a written constitution just as the Corsican Republic did (which I note you haven't even mentioned). Both were wholly elected. Before you suggest that the Corsican Republic wasn't the right time period, it fell just 7 years before the declaration of independence, that's fairly contemporary. I should think that if a regime fell back in 2005, you'd still remember it today.

What actual democratic difference to the people does it make whether that constitution is in a single document or several books? It sums up to make a single body of legislature. If I wanted to be pedantic, I could point out that due to all its amendments, the US constitution is now multiple documents. Yes, maybe the amendments + the original constitution together make one legal system, but the same is true of San Marino law (incidentally, you don't need a separate bill of rights to be democratic, those rights can be easily held within the regular constitution, it makes no difference). I believe that you've started with the mindset that only the US is allowed to fit your criteria, in which case you're doing nothing but being biased by your assumptions. Instead of proving the bold claim that America was the first modern democratic republic, you're now simply demonstrating that the US was the first country to have a system of government which is exactly the same as the US government. That isn't a claim that I would disagree with, but the US system still wasn't the first government to be both democratic and republic.

I'm sure that you're a lovely person but you're doing nothing to dispel my suspicion that history lessons in US schools are nothing but 60 minutes of flag-waving, chest-beating and chanting 'USA! USA!' whilst playing the theme to Team America.
 
 
 
Canadians celebrate Thanksgiving too. There's a difference between holidays and fabricating history.

 

Their Thanksgiving has a different story behind it though doesn't it?

 
But Canada wasn't a gov. entity, it was all part of the British Empire. Some places that now make up the US exist, but we don't celebrate the 7 years war because the government via the military of the United States of America never took part.

 

But those colonies still had their own governments. It was just before they were reorganised to have an overarching government in North America. I think the reason Americans don't celebrate the 7 years war is because American pride is largely based on their independence from Britain. Where as in Canada, they take pride in being the continuation of several British colonies.

 
America won in the US revolutionary war and then the 1812 war, I wouldn't call two victories in a row luck.

 

Well I still think that if America won, so did Britain/Canada. Both sides kept all their territory and didn't concede anything. Anyway, what I meant was it was lucky that impressment stopped, as in the war had little to do with stopping it. I'm not saying it was luck that the war ended. I'll admit that if the US hadn't put up a good fight, the British probably would have pressed on tried to take some of their territory, even if that wasn't one of their aims from the start. I'm sure the same is true the other way round.

 
Monarchy is the direct opposite of democracy. Democracy is will of the people via voting. Monarchy is will of one. A constitutional monarchy can never be a true democracy. The Fact that the monarchy can never be removed in the name of "tradition" is a direct contradiction to democracy.

 

But with a constitutional monarchy, the country is run by the will of the people via voting. The monarch doesn't run the country. Representatives voted for by the people do. And who says the monarch can never be removed? Plenty of countries have voted to become republics. There may not be a specific legal route to becoming a republic in the UK, but if the people really wanted to get rid of the monarchy, Parliament would make a law allowing them to do it. Parliament can do that, because they are the ones with the actual power, not the monarch. Jamaica is considering doing that, and Australia has toyed with the idea in the past. Malta and many other former British territories have done that.

What do you think about Norway? It's a pretty successful country with a monarch. In 1905 they became independent from Sweden and they had a vote to decide whether to become a republic or have a monarchy. They voted to have a monarch. How is that not democratic? I believe that if we had a referendum about becoming a republic in the UK right now, the people would vote to keep the monarchy.

 
You can't be a true republic unless you're democracy, and you can't be a true democracy unless you're a republic.

 

After looking it up, I think you're correct about republics having to be democracies to be true republics. In common usage it just means any country that doesn't have a hereditary ruler, but there is a more technical definition that means the country is run "by the people" in some form.

But here's the definition of democracy (from the oxford dictionary):

"a system of government by the whole population or all the eligible members of a state, typically through elected representatives"

Constitutional monarchies fit that definition because the government is voted for by the people. The monarch is not the government.
 
 
 
I see that you still haven't defined ' democratic republic', I'll give you one more chance, else I have better things to do than sit here going around in circles, and I'm sure the same goes for you too.

 

There's no special definition for democratic republic. I'm referring to the general definition. You on the other hand admitted your definition was based on your opinion.

 
I'll accept your problems with the Dutch system, but I'm sorry your refutation of the San Marino system is desperate at best. Its system was a series of laws which defined the powers of the people and the state, and included those laid out in a series of books. As the Oxford English Dictionary defines a constitution as: A body of principles according to which a state or organisation is governed

 

Your broad interpretation of that Oxford definition means every country in the history of the world has a constitution, which is not the case.

 
San Marino therefore had a constitution, a written constitution just as the Corsican Republic did (which I note you haven't even mentioned). Both were wholly elected. Before you suggest that the Corsican Republic wasn't the right time period, it fell just 7 years before the declaration of independence, that's fairly contemporary. I should think that if a regime fell back in 2005, you'd still remember it today.

 

What you've chosen to ignore is the fact that neither San Marino or Corsican have or had a written constitution with a bill of rights. Nor have you shown what makes these countries republics or democracies.

 
Then

What actual democratic difference to the people does it make whether that constitution is in a single document or several books? It sums up to make a single body of legislature. If I wanted to be pedantic, I could point out that due to all its amendments, the US constitution is now multiple documents. Yes, maybe the amendments + the original constitution together make one legal system, but the same is true of San Marino law (incidentally, you don't need a separate bill of rights to be democratic, those rights can be easily held within the regular constitution, it makes no difference). I believe that you've started with the mindset that only the US is allowed to fit your criteria, in which case you're doing nothing but being biased by your assumptions. Instead of proving the bold claim that America was the first modern democratic republic, you're now simply demonstrating that the US was the first country to have a system of government which is exactly the same as the US government. That isn't a claim that I would disagree with, but the US system still wasn't the first government to be both democratic and republic.

I'm sure that you're a lovely person but you're doing nothing to dispel my suspicion that history lessons in US schools are nothing but 60 minutes of flag-waving, chest-beating and chanting 'USA! USA!' whilst playing the theme to Team America.

 

If these San Marino books are a constitution, then the British could also claim all thier laws are a single constitution as well. A constitution should be a "framework" of the government. How can a collection of books be a framework? In your broad interpretation, how many books can you have before it's no longer a constitution? I mean think about it. When were will of all these books written? Who reads and verifies that all laws follow these books? It's ridiculous.

You're really reaching for this aren't you? All because you'd hate for the US to be known as the world's first modern republic and democracy with the world's first written constitution and bill of rights. But facts are facts and yours don't hold up.
 
 
 
You still don't get it. They were the same. Fact of the matter is the British were kidnapping US citizens knowingly provoking a war.

 

They weren't US citizens, they were British citizens. British law at the time didn't allow British citizens to change nationality.

 
The US did teach the British a lesson of don't threaten US sovereignty.

 

Britain taught the US a lesson: Don't invade Canada, or our militia and reserves will burn down your Capital.
The blockade and impressment were measures solely implemented to fight Napoleon, so the fact that the UK didn't do these things after the war, by which time Napoleon was defeated, is irrelevant.
How I know you are talking nonsense, is if the United States had truely 'taught' Britain a lesson, the UK wouldn't have blockaded the high seas during the Great War. US merchants wanted to trade with both the Entente and the Central Powers, but the Royal Navy stood their ground and the United States was forced into trading only with the Entente. One could even say that the United States was bullied into only trading with whom Britain dictated that they could trade with.

 
Obviously Britain was the instigator of the war by threatening US sovereignty with impressment. Name one country that would allow something like impressment?

 

The US was the only country that was harbouring British fugitives, so the point is mute. The vast majority of historians think that the US started the war, being the ones who fired the first shots and all. But obviously, you know better  
 
 
 
The US never wanted the British territory Canada. The war of 1812 was about protecting US sovereignty which was being threatened by British bullying and impressment. The British provoked the young and weak US to the point where they had no choice but to take action or risk becoming a target for invasion. The US attacked the closest British territory, was victorious in securing its sovereignty, and the rest is history.

 

The British were fighting for their very survival against one of the greatest armies ever amassed... but they decided to attack the US anyway. That was bold of them, attacking without an army. And of course, statements of prominent polticians like Thomas Jefferson like:

 
The acquisition of Canada this year, as far as the neighborhood of Quebec, will be a mere matter of marching, and will give us experience for the attack of Halifax the next, and the final expulsion of England from the American continent.
 

clearly don't tell us all about the american imperial ambitions at the time. America can't actually do anything wrong, obviously. It was all Britain's fault. We bow down to your inherent and unquestionable superiority.
 
 
 
If these San Marino books are a constitution, then the British could also claim all thier laws are a single constitution as well. A constitution should be a "framework" of the government. How can a collection of books be a framework? In your broad interpretation, how many books can you have before it's no longer a constitution? I mean think about it. When were will of all these books written? Who reads and verifies that all laws follow these books? It's ridiculous.

 

The British can claim all their laws are a single constitution. A constitution is merely a set of all powerful laws and principles governing an organisation, in this case a country. The British doctrine of Parliamentary sovereignty means that these all powerful laws and principles are any pieces of legislation passed by the House. A constitution doesn't have to codified and written out on a single statute. In the UK's case, it would be pointless since the House can't pass laws that bind it's future self and doesn't need a US style codified constitution to follow. This is yet another example of America thinking that it's way of thinking must be the only way of thinking.

Knowing him, he'll think you were being sincere.
 
 
 
Their Thanksgiving has a different story behind it though doesn't it?

 

None of that changes the fact that the US and Canada celebrate holidays based on traditions not born in their countries. It's the same for Christmas, Halloween, Easter, etc. Not to mention other countries do the same the - Japanese now celebrate Christmas.

Thats's the reason I said there's a difference between celebrating a holiday and fabricating history.

 
But those colonies still had their own governments. It was just before they were reorganised to have an overarching government in North America. I think the reason Americans don't celebrate the 7 years war is because American pride is largely based on their independence from Britain. Where as in Canada, they take pride in being the continuation of several British colonies.

 

But they were British sub-governments with British appointed governors, not a Canadian government because Canada as a government entity did not exist.

The real reason why the US doesn't celebrate the 7 years war is because- it doesn't make sense to celebrate a war you government never fought. If it's all a "continuation", do Jamaicans get to celebrate the 1812 war too? What about the Australians?

 
Well I still think that if America won, so did Britain/Canada. Both sides kept all their territory and didn't concede anything. Anyway, what I meant was it was lucky that impressment stopped, as in the war had little to do with stopping it. I'm not saying it was luck that the war ended. I'll admit that if the US hadn't put up a good fight, the British probably would have pressed on tried to take some of their territory, even if that wasn't one of their aims from the start. I'm sure the same is true the other way round.

 

This is why you're still confused, you think the war was about territory. It was about the British threatening US sovereignty through impressment. The US succeeded in it's objective of securing its sovereignty and ending impressment.

 
But with a constitutional monarchy, the country is run by the will of the people via voting. The monarch doesn't run the country. Representatives voted for by the people do. And who says the monarch can never be removed? Plenty of countries have voted to become republics. There may not be a specific legal route to becoming a republic in the UK, but if the people really wanted to get rid of the monarchy, Parliament would make a law allowing them to do it. Parliament can do that, because they are the ones with the actual power, not the monarch. Jamaica is considering doing that, and Australia has toyed with the idea in the past. Malta and many other former British territories have done that.

 

A constitutional monarchy will never be a true democracy because it has the word "monarchy' in it and it's not a republic because of said monarchy. The only reason these monarchies are still around in the year 2012 is because they are monarchies, and run on power which was never given to them by the people. And this power is strong enough to keep them in place. The only way to remove a monarchy, is to have a revolution.

 
What do you think about Norway? It's a pretty successful country with a monarch. In 1905 they became independent from Sweden and they had a vote to decide whether to become a republic or have a monarchy. They voted to have a monarch. How is that not democratic? I believe that if we had a referendum about becoming a republic in the UK right now, the people would vote to keep the monarchy.

 

Nice or dormant tyranny is stil tyranny.

That's the major difference between true democracies and constitutional monarchies, democracies would never vote to prop up an unelected person for an endless term.

 
After looking it up, I think you're correct about republics having to be democracies to be true republics. In common usage it just means any country that doesn't have a hereditary ruler, but there is a more technical definition that means the country is run "by the people" in some form.

But here's the definition of democracy (from the oxford dictionary):

"a system of government by the whole population or all the eligible members of a state, typically through elected representatives"

Constitutional monarchies fit that definition because the government is voted for by the people. The monarch is not the government.

 

The reason why constitutional monarchies don't fit the definition fully is because the monarchy is not an elected representative and holds the position for an endless term. That one part, messes everything up.
 
 
 
They weren't US citizens, they were British citizens. British law at the time didn't allow British citizens to change nationality.

 

Some were US citizens, others were immigrant or those seeking refuge. Fact is they were on US territory and property, and their classification is for the US to determine. The British were threatening US sovereignty and provoked the war by not respecting that.

 
Britain taught the US a lesson: Don't invade Canada, or our militia and reserves will burn down your Capital.
The blockade and impressment were measures solely implemented to fight Napoleon, so the fact that the UK didn't do these things after the war, by which time Napoleon was defeated, is irrelevant.

One could even say that the United States was bullied into only trading with whom Britain dictated that they could trade with.

 

Wrong again. The US taught the British to respect US sovereignty, and from then on they applied the lesson they learned by not longer threatening US sovereignty.

Th bullying via impressment and blockade by the British is what provoked the war, which initiated the US taught lesson for British Empire.

 
The US was the only country that was harbouring British fugitives, so the point is mute. The vast majority of historians think that the US started the war, being the ones who fired the first shots and all. But obviously, you know better  

 

That's some great work of fiction you got there.

US politicians say a lot of stuff including the founding father, who were politicians.

America's objective was to secure its sovereignty and gain respect, and had to take action and attack or acquire if possible the closest British territory. The young and weak US underestimated the British because they thought they were preoccupied, but still achieved its objective.

So you admit that the US was trying to take territory, and that they were over-confident? Politicians say stuff, but also do stuff, like launch invasions.

But aside from all this nationalistic BS - to address the original question: you don't have to be represented by a government to be proud of something. Football fans can be proud of their team winning, rebels can be proud of their military victories, tibetans can be proud of tibet, even if it isn't a country. I'd say the 1812 war was perhaps the first time Canada developed a national identity. They had held out against the odds, with most fighters living in the local area, and they can be proud of that (at least until British regulars arrived). That's proud as Canadians, a subset of British at the time (just like Tibet and China, or Yankees fan and american), but still a valid identification.

Britain has acknowledged that it has no constitution. So you're wasting your time. After the US wrote its constitution, a constitution craze sprang up around the world. Some in Britain wanted to create a written constitution like the US, but the majority were spiteful and frequently wrote that Britain should avoid constitutions and that Britain was better without a constitution. It's all historical fact.

Here's a keynote that explains it better and explains why the US has the worlds first written constitution with the world's first bill of rights.

Around 5:35 she highlights 4 innovations which make the US constitution the first written democratic republic constitution in the world.

Around 16:19 she begins to explain why Britain has no constitution.

Because the British were threatening US sovereignty, the US declared war. In war you have to attack, and when you attack, you usually try to acquire territory. This is standard practice. As I've said, acquiring British territory was never the objective, the objective was to declare war and fight in order to secure and assert US sovereignty - this was achieved, and therefore the US was victorious

 
But aside from all this nationalistic BS - to address the original question: you don't have to be represented by a government to be proud of something. Football fans can be proud of their team winning, rebels can be proud of their military victories, tibetans can be proud of tibet, even if it isn't a country.

That's proud as Canadians, a subset of British at the time (just like Tibet and China, or Yankees fan and american), but still a valid identification.

 

That doesn't make sense because "Canada" was not a government entity when that war took place. Not to mention the fact that Canadians are celebrating a mythology based on an imaginary "Canada victory", when in fact Canada didn't exist, and it was a US victory over the British.

My main point is- don't rewrite history, when you didn't even participate.

This is why Canadians are struggling with an inferiority complex and identity crisis because they are basing their national identity on fiction.
 
 
 
Some were US citizens, others were immigrant or those seeking refuge. Fact is they were on US territory and property, and their classification is for the US to determine. The British were threatening US sovereignty and provoked the war by not respecting that.

 

Can you read? British law at the time did not recognise the right of British citizens to give up British citizenship. In the eyes of the British government, the US had no right to nuetralise these citizens. Be they a convict, a deserter, an immigrant or a refugee, they were British citizens and privy to be conscripted at that time of war.

 
Wrong again. The US taught the British to respect US sovereignty, and from then on they applied the lesson they learned by not longer threatening US sovereignty.

 

Again, can you read? How exactly do you explain the Royal Navy blockade of Europe during the Great War? During the Great War, US merchant ships were boarded, inspected and barred from trading with the Central Powers. Some lesson that must have been, if Britain totally and completely disregarded it.

 
Th bullying via impressment and blockade by the British is what provoked the war, which initiated the US taught lesson for British Empire.

 

Don't actually bother to respond to any of my points, just keep repeating the same old tired nonsense.

 
That's some great work of fiction you got there.

 

Just because you don't like what you hear, doesn't make it fiction. Here's an overview of the views generally accepted by historians, from the War of 1812 wikipedia page. They all have differing views, however one thing is for sure- No one thinks that Britain lost, and the view that Britain alone was victorious has a bigger following than the view that America alone was victorious.

Historians have differing and more complex interpretations. They are in full agreement that the native Indians were the war's clear losers, losing land, power and any hope of keeping their semi-autonomous status. Historians also agree that ending the war with neither side gaining or losing territory allowed for the peaceful settlement of boundary disputes and for the opening of a permanent era of good will and friendly relations between the U.S. and Canada.

In recent decades the view of the majority of historians has been that the war ended in stalemate, with the Treaty of Ghent closing a war that had become militarily inconclusive. Neither side wanted to continue fighting since the main causes had disappeared and since there were no large lost territories for one side or the other to reclaim by force. Insofar as they see the war's untriumphant resolution as allowing two centuries of peaceful and mutually beneficial intercourse between the U.S., Britain and Canada, these historians often conclude that all three nations were the "real winners" of the War of 1812. These writers often add that the war could have been avoided in the first place by better diplomacy. It is seen as a mistake for everyone concerned because it was badly planned and marked by multiple fiascoes and failures on both sides, as shown especially by the repeated American failure to seize parts of Canada, and the failed British invasions of New Orleans and upstate New York.[135][136]

However, other scholars hold that the war constituted a British victory and an American defeat. They argue that the British achieved their military objectives in 1812 (by stopping the repeated American invasions of Canada) and that Canada retained her independence of the United States. By contrast, they say, the Americans suffered a defeat when their armies failed to achieve their war goal of seizing part or all of Canada. Additionally, they argue the US lost as it failed to stop impressment, which the British refused to repeal until the end of the Napoleonic Wars, and the US actions had no effect on the orders in council, which were rescinded before the war started.[137][138]

A second minority view is that both the US and Britain won the war – that is, both achieved their main objectives, while the Indians were the losing party.[139][140] The British won by losing no territories and achieving their great war goal, the total defeat of Napoleon. U.S. won by (1) securing her honour and successfully resisting a powerful empire once again,[nb 3] thus winning a "second war of independence";[141] (2) ending the threat of Indian raids and the British plan for a semi-independent Indian sanctuary—thereby opening an unimpeded path for the United States' westward expansion—and (3) stopping the Royal Navy from restricting American trade and impressing American sailors.[142]
 
 
 
Britain has acknowledged that it has no constitution. So you're wasting your time.

 

When has Britain ever acknowleged that? That's straight up bull****. It doesn't have a codifed constitution. Read up the bloody definition of the word. A constitution is a set of principles and rules governing an organisation. In the UK's case, it is the laws put out by Parliament.

 
After the US wrote its constitution, a constitution craze sprang up around the world. Some in Britain wanted to create a written constitution like the US, but the majority were spiteful and frequently wrote that Britain should avoid constitutions and that Britain was better without a constitution. It's all historical fact.

 

If by historical fact, you mean completely fabricated nonsense on your part. You have just completely made that up; admit it. As I said, read a damn dictionary.

a body of fundamental principles or established precedents according to which a state or other organization is acknowledged to be governed:

I don't believe those were democratic republics with a written constitution and bill of rights.

You do know the US revolution (1775-1783) was before the French revolution (1789-1799) right?

 

Yes, I've already apologized for ****ing up my dates there.

Switzerland had a written set of laws. It might not have been a "constitution" by your stupidly strict standards, but you cannot deny that they were democratic republics way, way, way before the USA was.
 
 
As far as I'm concerned this is just a last ditch attempt by the Americans to salvage some pride.

There's no special definition for democratic republic. I'm referring to the general definition. You on the other hand admitted your definition was based on your opinion.

 

I see. Well, the 'general definition' of a democratic republic is a government which is wholly elected and ran by set law rather than a monarch. Ergo, the Corsican Republic and San Marino both qualify as democratic republics before America.

Some sources

Oxford English Dictionary

Democracy:

 
1) Form of government in which the people can vote for representatives to govern the state on their behalf. 2) A state governed by elected representatives.
 

Republic:

 
State in which power is held by the people and their elected representatives and which has a president rather than a king or queen
 

Encyclopaedia Britannica

Democracy:

 
Democracy, literally, rule by the people. The term is derived from the Greek dēmokratiā, which was coined from dēmos (“people”) and kratos (“rule”) in the middle of the 5th century bc to denote the political systems then existing in some Greek city-states, notably Athens.
 

Republic:

 
Republic, form of government in which a state is ruled by representatives elected by its populace. The term was originally applied to a form of government in which the leader is periodically appointed under a constitution; it was contrasted with governments in which leadership is hereditary. A republic may also be distinguished from direct democracy, though modern representative democracies are by and large republics.
 

Anecdotal sources

Wikipedia defines a republic as:

 
A republic is a form of government in which the people, or some significant portion of them, have supreme control over the government and where offices of state are elected or chosen by elected people.[1][2] In modern times, a common simplified definition of a republic is a government where the head of state is not a monarch.[3][4] The word republic is derived from the Latin phrase res publica, which can be translated as "the public affair", and often used to describe a state using this form of government.
 

And defines a democracy as:

 
Democracy is the ideal that all the citizens of a nation determine together the laws or actions of their state, requiring that all citizens have an equal opportunity to express their consent and their will. In practise, "democracy" is the extent to which a given system approximates this ideal, and a given political system is referred to as "a democracy" if it allows a certain approximation to ideal democracy.
 

Someone also defines a 'democratic republic' rather well on  Yahoo questions  :

 
A democracy is one where the government is directly chosen by the people (i.e., through elections); a Republic is one where government authority is derived through the will of the people. Thus, a Democratic Republic would be one where ultimate authority and power is derived from the citizens.
 

If my sources somehow seem incorrect to you, please provide your own which agree with your preferred definition. Maybe you can find me a source where it says that democratic republics need to have a bill of rights? Good luck with that.

The Corsican Republic meets all the above required criteria to be classed as both a republic and a democracy.

 
Your broad interpretation of that Oxford definition means every country in the history of the world has a constitution, which is not the case.
 

The definition I gave is exactly what it means, by all means check a dictionary of your own (I assume that you know the difference between a codified constitution and an uncodified one). When discussing the Corsican constitution however I'm referring to a single codified constitutional document, exactly the same as that of the United States. Corsica did have a codified constitution, a single 9 page document, written by Pasquale Paoli (its president). Not only that, it gave universal suffrage, truly ahead of its time.

With firm patience, he reorganised the island and gave rights and dignity to its people. He made it into a nation with a constitution, an army, a monetary system, a very strict justice and an efficient civil service. He founded a university in Corti, opened schools, encouraged economy, and promoted industry and commerce. He also introduced the culture of potatoes and planted more chestnut trees, created ports for commercial exchanges, and exploited the island’s lead and silver mines. Under his enlightened rule the island became a successful democratic republic, admired and commented upon by many writers in Europe, including Rousseau (w) and Voltaire (w), who were to write drafts for the constitution.
 

From  http://paoli.org.uk/pasquale-paoli-biography/ 

 
Paoli remained as president between 1757 and 1768 governing with wide powers and within the framework of a fairly liberal formal constitution after May 1762. This constitution was of an immense influence on the progressive thinking of the day and was often regarded with envy by those of liberal inclination who lived in those European states that were more completely ruled under the sway of monarchies. Many persons among the increasingly well educated and prosperous middle classes in several European states profoundly hoped for, (but did not seriously expect), the adoption of a Constitution by their own sovereign as this would tend to place legal limitations on the powers of that ruler to impose negatively on the lives and aspirations of the middle classes.

Spoiler:

WHEN the Corsicans, in the twenty-ffth year of their rebellion
against Genoese colonial rule, elected Pasquale Paoli General of the
nation, they found a leader well qualified to consolidate their
independence. From 1755, until France annexed the island in 1769,
he governed the greater part of Corsica as an autonomous state. It
was a very small state; yet his achievement earned him an international
reputation. His admirers regarded his system as democratic;
for Boswell it was 'the best model that hath ever existed in the democratical
form'. Voltaire expressed a more measured appreciation:
Paoli, he writes, did not claim the title of king, but he acted as such
in several respects, by 'placing himself at the head of a democratic
government'.

----

The sovereign people creates a constitution
for its own well-being, a role which historians have hitherto
supposed was assumed for the first time by the people of the United
States. The concepts of liberty as a natural right (implicit in the
word 'reconquered'), of the happiness of the nation as the proper
aim of government, of the nation as the aggregate of the sovereign
people, are in line with the celebrated texts of the American and
French Revolutions: the American Declaration of Independence,
La Declaration des Droits de l'Homme et du Citoyen.
How did it happen that the Corsicans, a notoriously poor, backward
people, were the first to proclaim and act upon these ideas? It
should be borne in mind that they were near enough to the Italy of
the Illuminismo to be in touch with contemporary developments of
European thought.

What you've chosen to ignore is the fact that neither San Marino or Corsican have or had a written constitution with a bill of rights. Nor have you shown what makes these countries republics or democracies.
 

See above about Corsica's constitution.
There's nothing in the sources I have provided which suggest that a state needs a separate bill of rights to be classed as either a democracy or a republic. Feel free to find a source contrary to this. It may be your opinion that one is necessary, but after you shooting down my opinion, I'm hardly going to accept your opinion without sources backing it either.

My knowledge of the San Marino system is sketchy; in Corsica, however, Pasquale Paoli was indeed completely elected, he was rather obsessed with democracy and liberty, and was determined to reform Corsica, which he did.

 
If these San Marino books are a constitution, then the British could also claim all thier laws are a single constitution as well. A constitution should be a "framework" of the government. How can a collection of books be a framework? In your broad interpretation, how many books can you have before it's no longer a constitution? I mean think about it. When were will of all these books written? Who reads and verifies that all laws follow these books? It's ridiculous.
 

The British system does also surmount to a single uncodified constitution. A constitution doesn't have to be one document, it's the sum of the legislature laying out the state's powers.

 
You're really reaching for this aren't you? All because you'd hate for the US to be known as the world's first modern republic and democracy with the world's first written constitution and bill of rights. But facts are facts and yours don't hold up.
 

No more desperate that you are for the USA to be the first.   In conclusion, the Corsican Republic was democratic, a republic, and had a constitution akin to that of the United States, and 2 decades before the US existed.

And, as I've demonstrated, a separate bill of rights is neither a prerequisite of a democracy nor a republic.
 
 
 
None of that changes the fact that the US and Canada celebrate holidays based on traditions not born in their countries. It's the same for Christmas, Halloween, Easter, etc. Not to mention other countries do the same the - Japanese now celebrate Christmas.

Thats's the reason I said there's a difference between celebrating a holiday and fabricating history.

 

Ok, they're not quite the same. But I will point out that it's hardly uncommon for countries to take "credit" for events that happened before that country existed in it's current form. For example I bet France takes "credit" for the 100 years war, despite the fact the France of today is constitutionally and territorially very, very different from the France that fought the 100 years war.

 
This is why you're still confused, you think the war was about territory. It was about the British threatening US sovereignty through impressment. The US succeeded in it's objective of securing its sovereignty and ending impressment.

 

But the British ended impressment anyway. At the most, the war with the US was a minor factor in the decision to end impressment. If you look at the facts, the British started impressment so they had more people to fight against Napoleon. Then the war against Napoleon ended, then they ended impressment. There wasn't any need for them to continue doing it. At most the war against the US was a minor factor in ending the practice. As for securing their sovereignity, didn't they do that in the last war they had against Britain? Don't worry, I'm not going to argue the British didn't lose that one  

 
A constitutional monarchy will never be a true democracy because it has the word "monarchy' in it and it's not a republic because of said monarchy. The only reason these monarchies are still around in the year 2012 is because they are monarchies, and run on power which was never given to them by the people. And this power is strong enough to keep them in place. The only way to remove a monarchy, is to have a revolution.

Nice or dormant tyranny is stil tyranny.

That's the major difference between true democracies and constitutional monarchies, democracies would never vote to prop up an unelected person for an endless term.

The reason why constitutional monarchies don't fit the definition fully is because the monarchy is not an elected representative and holds the position for an endless term. That one part, messes everything up.

 

Well we might as well end this conversation because you have clearly invented your own definition of democracy. And it's simply not true that you need to have a revolution to get rid of a monarchy. Malta for one did exactly that. They declared themselves a republic after the people voted for a republican party, and that was that. Jamaica is considering becoming a republic, but there's no talk of rising up against the government.

I suppose I can understand that it is perhaps not a "full" democracy, but no country is. Having an elected head of state doesn't automatically make a country more democratic than one where there is an unelected, but powerless, ceremonial figurehead.

The UK's Queen may not be an elected representative, but she's not really part of the government either. She doesn't get a say in the decision making, other than advising the PM (who is free to take advice from whoever they like).

edit - Another thing that came to mind. The UK Parliament actually has the power to change the laws of succession, in other words how to determine who the next monarch will be. In fact they did so only a few months ago. So surely that means they have the power to make the "monarch" an elected position if they wanted to? The fact is they don't because that's not currently what the majority of voters want.
 
 
 
Ok, they're not quite the same. But I will point out that it's hardly uncommon for countries to take "credit" for events that happened before that country existed in it's current form.

Modern French people (and generally France as a whole) also try to take credit for the Norman Invasion of England! If that doesn't illustrate your point, nothing does.

The 1812 war was between the US and the British. Canada as a government didn't exist until 1867. Yet Canadians continue to claim that they beat America, when in reality the US never fought "Canada" and has more of right to claim victory than the British (because the US won the last major battle and ended British impressment, which was what started the war in the first place). So how could Canada have participated in the 1812 war, when at that time "Canada" was only known as a region of North America? It seems to me Canadians are looking for something to get patriotic about, but facts are facts. Is there nothing else Canadians can use for patriotism besides this fiction that's based on nothing but historically false mythology?

Here's an article from the March 2012 issue of the Canadian magazine Walrus titled "That Time We Beat the Americans".

 http://walrusmagazine.com/article.ph...-the-americans 

 

The US wasn't a country in the Revolutionary War yet they celebrate it as a national event; typical bias Yank. Its funny watching you and Canada squabble because you're all pretty much British in blood anyway.

How does that work? A lot of countries were founded on a revolution. Why can we not? We celebrate the birth of our country and the establishment of freedom and democracy.

You are incredibly arrogant. The US has a lot of british culture, but it also has a lot of other cultures from around the world and in fact it has a rich and diverse culture of its own, distinct from europe, like thanksgiving.
 
 
 
I'm not going to argue the British didn't lose that one  

 

Although we also won it as well, if we start going by this guy's definitions.

 
like thanksgiving.

 

You mean Christmas II?  
 
 
 
Wow.You are truly confused. The US Civil was ONLY about slavery. I guess WW2 wasn't about Germany invading  

The 1812 war was about protecting US sovereignty which was being threatened by British impressment.

 

Let's not pretend that the Union was entirely for Abolition and the South was the opposite. Division over whether the new western states would be able to have slavery and the argument over the state's own individual right was very important in the split. The war was over succession, only later on did Lincoln finally attach himself to Abolition. And actually the origins of the Second World War lie much deeper than Germany invading Poland.
 
 
 
lol, canada are the ones trying to pretend they won the war against us, even though it was the british who started it and the US who finished it.

 

Other way round mate.
 
 
 
Can you read? British law at the time did not recognise the right of British citizens to give up British citizenship. In the eyes of the British government, the US had no right to nuetralise these citizens. Be they a convict, a deserter, an immigrant or a refugee, they were British citizens and privy to be conscripted at that time of war.

 

Ironically you can't read because I've addressed this countless times. The US has no obligation to follow British law unless there's a previous agreement.

 
Again, can you read? How exactly do you explain the Royal Navy blockade of Europe during the Great War? During the Great War, US merchant ships were boarded, inspected and barred from trading with the Central Powers. Some lesson that must have been, if Britain totally and completely disregarded it.

 

Source?

During WW1 the British never threatened US sovereignty.

 
Don't actually bother to respond to any of my points, just keep repeating the same old tired nonsense.

Just because you don't like what you hear, doesn't make it fiction. Here's an overview of the views generally accepted by historians, from the War of 1812 wikipedia page. They all have differing views, however one thing is for sure- No one thinks that Britain lost, and the view that Britain alone was victorious has a bigger following than the view that America alone was victorious.

Historians have differing and more complex interpretations. They are in full agreement that the native Indians were the war's clear losers, losing land, power and any hope of keeping their semi-autonomous status. Historians also agree that ending the war with neither side gaining or losing territory allowed for the peaceful settlement of boundary disputes and for the opening of a permanent era of good will and friendly relations between the U.S. and Canada.

In recent decades the view of the majority of historians has been that the war ended in stalemate, with the Treaty of Ghent closing a war that had become militarily inconclusive. Neither side wanted to continue fighting since the main causes had disappeared and since there were no large lost territories for one side or the other to reclaim by force. Insofar as they see the war's untriumphant resolution as allowing two centuries of peaceful and mutually beneficial intercourse between the U.S., Britain and Canada, these historians often conclude that all three nations were the "real winners" of the War of 1812. These writers often add that the war could have been avoided in the first place by better diplomacy. It is seen as a mistake for everyone concerned because it was badly planned and marked by multiple fiascoes and failures on both sides, as shown especially by the repeated American failure to seize parts of Canada, and the failed British invasions of New Orleans and upstate New York.[135][136]

However, other scholars hold that the war constituted a British victory and an American defeat. They argue that the British achieved their military objectives in 1812 (by stopping the repeated American invasions of Canada) and that Canada retained her independence of the United States. By contrast, they say, the Americans suffered a defeat when their armies failed to achieve their war goal of seizing part or all of Canada. Additionally, they argue the US lost as it failed to stop impressment, which the British refused to repeal until the end of the Napoleonic Wars, and the US actions had no effect on the orders in council, which were rescinded before the war started.[137][138]

A second minority view is that both the US and Britain won the war – that is, both achieved their main objectives, while the Indians were the losing party.[139][140] The British won by losing no territories and achieving their great war goal, the total defeat of Napoleon. U.S. won by (1) securing her honour and successfully resisting a powerful empire once again,[nb 3] thus winning a "second war of independence";[141] (2) ending the threat of Indian raids and the British plan for a semi-independent Indian sanctuary—thereby opening an unimpeded path for the United States' westward expansion—and (3) stopping the Royal Navy from restricting American trade and impressing American sailors.[142]

 

I read it alright, but knew it was fiction as soon as you mentioned vast majority of historians and provided no sources. And now you do the same thing agian. Fact is the British instigated the war by threatening US sovereignty and the US won that very war by securing US sovereignty.
 
 
 
When has Britain ever acknowleged that? That's straight up bull****. It doesn't have a codifed constitution. Read up the bloody definition of the word. A constitution is a set of principles and rules governing an organisation. In the UK's case, it is the laws put out by Parliament.

 

Britain has never had a written constitution. A constitution is a framework for the government, not all the laws that have ever been passed.
As I've shown you, this historian explains it much better:

 
Britain has acknowledged that it has no constitution. So you're wasting your time. *After the US wrote its constitution, a constitution craze sprang up around the world. Some in Britain wanted to create a written constitution like the US, but the majority were spiteful and frequently wrote that Britain should avoid constitutions and that Britain was better without a constitution. It's all historical fact.*

Here's a keynote that explains it better and explains why the US has the worlds first written constitution with the world's first bill of rights.

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA29TbsNmkQ 

Around 5:35 she highlights 4 innovations which make the US constitution the first written democratic republic constitution in the world.*

Around 11:32 she further explains why the written constitution was pioneered by the US.

Around 16:19 she begins to explain why Britain has no constitution.

 

 
If by historical fact, you mean completely fabricated nonsense on your part. You have just completely made that up; admit it. As I said, read a damn dictionary.

Except as I said, your understanding of what a constitution is is wholefully far from the truth.

Here is the Oxford English definition of constitution:
a body of fundamental principles or established precedents according to which a state or other organization is acknowledged to be governed:

Here is a page explaining what a constitution actually is. I suggest you read it.
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution 

Here is a page explaining the UK constitution
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constit...United_Kingdom 

Parliament itself is even helpful enough to detail out the terms of the British constitution.

Just incase you were left in any doubt, or you're just being stubborn as usual, here's a helpful report from Oxford University.
 http://www.oup.com/uk/orc/bin/978019...dbent_ch01.pdf 

To wrap up, here's a short video summarising what you are:
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrjwaqZfjIY 

 

As the historian in the video explains: Britain still doesn't have a written constitution because of the status quo government who resented the new trend pioneered by the US. But the British people have been so inspired by America's constitution that they've began searching for something that could stand in as a british constitution. So inorder to calm down the ever-growing call for a real constitution by the people, the British use a paperless or uncodified constitution, which is not a constitution.

It is clear you have little understanding of US history, and when you try and argue it, you only make yourself look stupid.
 
 
 
Yes, I've already apologized for ****ing up my dates there.

Switzerland had a written set of laws. It might not have been a "constitution" by your stupidly strict standards, but you cannot deny that they were democratic republics way, way, way before the USA was.

 

Every government in the history of the world has or had a set of laws. That's not a constitution because it isn't a constitution in the general since. The US is the world's first modern democracy.
 
 
 
I see. Well, the 'general definition' of a democratic republic is a government which is wholly elected and ran by set law rather than a monarch. Ergo, the Corsican Republic and San Marino both qualify as democratic republics before America.

Some sources

Oxford English Dictionary

Democracy:

Republic:

Encyclopaedia Britannica

Democracy:

Republic:

Anecdotal sources

Wikipedia defines a republic as:

And defines a democracy as:

Someone also defines a 'democratic republic' rather well on  Yahoo questions  :

If my sources somehow seem incorrect to you, please provide your own which agree with your preferred definition. Maybe you can find me a source where it says that democratic republics need to have a bill of rights? Good luck with that.

The Corsican Republic meets all the above required criteria to be classed as both a republic and a democracy.

The definition I gave is exactly what it means, by all means check a dictionary of your own (I assume that you know the difference between a codified constitution and an uncodified one). When discussing the Corsican constitution however I'm referring to a single codified constitutional document, exactly the same as that of the United States. Corsica did have a codified constitution, a single 9 page document, written by Pasquale Paoli (its president). Not only that, it gave universal suffrage, truly ahead of its time.

You can read a paper about it  here , I can download it free by logging in with my uni details, so presumably you can too with your college/uni ones. If you can get the whole thing then its a good read, if not then I've provided snippets below (and the snapshot of the first page gives a good overview).
Spoiler:

WHEN the Corsicans, in the twenty-ffth year of their rebellion
against Genoese colonial rule, elected Pasquale Paoli General of the
nation, they found a leader well qualified to consolidate their
independence. From 1755, until France annexed the island in 1769,
he governed the greater part of Corsica as an autonomous state. It
was a very small state; yet his achievement earned him an international
reputation. His admirers regarded his system as democratic;
for Boswell it was 'the best model that hath ever existed in the democratical
form'. Voltaire expressed a more measured appreciation:
Paoli, he writes, did not claim the title of king, but he acted as such
in several respects, by 'placing himself at the head of a democratic
government'.

----

The sovereign people creates a constitution
for its own well-being, a role which historians have hitherto
supposed was assumed for the first time by the people of the United
States. The concepts of liberty as a natural right (implicit in the
word 'reconquered'), of the happiness of the nation as the proper
aim of government, of the nation as the aggregate of the sovereign
people, are in line with the celebrated texts of the American and
French Revolutions: the American Declaration of Independence,
La Declaration des Droits de l'Homme et du Citoyen.
How did it happen that the Corsicans, a notoriously poor, backward
people, were the first to proclaim and act upon these ideas? It
should be borne in mind that they were near enough to the Italy of
the Illuminismo to be in touch with contemporary developments of
European thought.

A google translated discussion of the constitution from French, the translation may be off in places, but it's more than readable:

See above about Corsica's constitution.
There's nothing in the sources I have provided which suggest that a state needs a separate bill of rights to be classed as either a democracy or a republic. Feel free to find a source contrary to this. It may be your opinion that one is necessary, but after you shooting down my opinion, I'm hardly going to accept your opinion without sources backing it either.

Wow. The fact that the US is the world's first modern democracy with the world's first written constitution with a bill of rights is killing you isn't it?

You still haven't shown what makes The Corsican Republic a republic or a democracy. Not to mention the fact the Corsican Republic lasted about a decade.

Uncodified constitutions aren't real constitutions. They're just half-assed political attempts to adopt American innovations without actually do so.

Because the US invented the written constitution, If it doesn't have a bill of rights included, it just isn't a real constitution.

During WW1 the British never threatened US sovereignty.

 

They never threatened US sovereignty during the Napoleonic wars either. That's something from your imagination. This goes directly to your claim that America 'taught' Britain a lesson. If that was the case, Britain wouldn't have taken the exact same measures during WW1 as it did during the Napelonic wars.

Britain has an democratic element in its government versus being real democracy like the US.

Not all revolutions have to be violent.

Your Monarchy is head of state with out a single British vote for an endless term. This is not a real democracy. Unfortunately the UK will be a monarchy in the name of "tradition" until there's a revolution.

As I've already said:

 
Your comments make no sense and ignore the universal understanding of a revolution. If the rebels succeed in their revolution, then they are no longer the nationality of the country they rebelled against and are historically considered a new nationality during and after the revolution.

The US revolution doesn't relate to Canada and the 1812 war. Canada can make no claim to the 1812 war because they weren't a government entity until 1867, nor were they in limbo of becoming a country when that war took place. The same way the US can't claim the 7 years war between the British and French.

 
 
 
 
Let's not pretend that the Union was entirely for Abolition and the South was the opposite. Division over whether the new western states would be able to have slavery and the argument over the state's own individual right was very important in the split.

Yes it was entirely because of slavery.

And WW2 was because Germany wanted more land and power and invaded another country.
 
 
Lying about things in an arrogant manner is typical canadian behavior. Canadians as a whole suffer from an inferiority complex that makes them come off as the ugly sister to the beauty queen. Canadians are a miserable bunch--no one takes them seriously on the ground level or in government. Don't blame them for not knowing history correctly. They are too busy killing seal and ruining the environment with their ridiculous search for oil sands. They will never be important in the world stage.
 
 
 
I know it's not uncommon. But it's wrong.

 

What's your opinion on Californians taking "credit" for the American Revolution?

Also the US taking "credit" for beating the UK in that war is also incorrect. They beat Great Britain which is technically a different country from the modern UK.

I'm just trying to figure out what your rules are about when it's ok to take "credit". Really it's a bit stupid for anyone to take credit for anything they were not personally involved in.

I'm just trying to figure out what your rules are about when it's ok to take "credit". Really it's a bit stupid for anyone to take credit for anything they were not personally involved in.

 

Now you're just getting silly. But hey, if you "modern" Brits don't want to claim the British Empire of the past and all of its history and achievements, then that's your prerogative. But the US beat the British Empire, which was once the strongest in the world, twice.
 
 
 
Like I said an uncodified constitution is a half-ass attempt to adopt an American innovation by actually not doing so. A constitution is a framework, not a every single law ever passed.

Of course there wont be an article with "resent" and "spite".

Britain was around long before America, so don't flatter yourselves. An uncodified constitution is how one is naturally by default- you then go out of your way to codify it. If you don't codify it that's not an half-ass attempt at anything; it's specifically not trying.

 
A constitution is a framework, not a every single law ever passed.

 

No it's not. Every major dictionary and linguistical organisation, as well as major universities and the British parliament says otherwise. Unless you are the actual inventor of the English language, you don't have a leg to stand on on this point.

 
Of course there wont be an article with "resent" and "spite".

 

So you admit that you actually have no evidence to back up your viewpoint?

Interesting reading. Notice how it constantly states that the UK does in fact have a constitution, just that it's not written down and codified.

And it also says, in regards to why the UK constitution has not been codified:
Essentially because the country has been too stable for too long.

That doesn't sound anything all like the impression you were giving, that of an angry population demanding a codified constitution.

Did you also pick up where it said:

Ironically, several [countries] based their written constitutions on Britain's unwritten version.

Thanks for destroying your own argument, moron.
 
 
 
Every government in the history of the world has or had a set of laws. That's not a constitution because it isn't a constitution in the general since. The US is the world's first modern democracy.

 

That just simply isn't true, but I can't be arsed anymore because of your ridiculous definition of what a democracy actually is.
 
 
 
Never heard of it, I'd guess because California was not a government entity when the US revolution took place.

 

So would you find it strange for some from California to say "We beat the British in the American Revolution"?

 
Now you're just getting silly. But hey, if you "modern" Brits don't want to claim the British Empire of the past and all of its history and achievements, then that's your prerogative. But the US beat the British Empire, which was once the strongest in the world, twice.

 

The "glory days" of the British Empire were in the 19th century, after it became the UK. But if it's "silly" not to count anything before then, then at what point is it no longer "silly" to not give them "credit"? Would you think it's "silly" for the UK to claim it was not involved in pre-union England's wars? How much does a place to have change before it can no longer claim involvement? You seem to think there are strict rules about when it's ok to take credit, so lets hear what those rules are.

 
Britain was around long before America, so don't flatter yourselves.

 

Well, sort of. Britain, as a united country, had only existed for about 70 years by the time the American Revolution happened. But of course it was the continuation of two countries that did have a long history, rather than being an entirely new country.
 
 
history can never be rewritten
 
 
 
Wow. The fact that the US is the world's first modern democracy with the world's first written constitution with a bill of rights is killing you isn't it?

You still haven't shown what makes The Corsican Republic a republic or a democracy. Not to mention the fact the Corsican Republic lasted about a decade.

Uncodified constitutions aren't real constitutions. They're just half-assed political attempts to adopt American innovations without actually do so.

Because the US invented the written constitution, If it doesn't have a bill of rights included, it just isn't a real constitution.

This historian explains exactly why US has the world's first written constitution.

 

It matters to you too or you'd be ignoring me by now. I'm just a fan of history and like establishing fact.

The Corsican constitution was a codified, written constitution, as I said before. A 9 page document, written by the elected leader, Pasquale Paoli, the sources I provided clearly explained that. The sources I included also explained what makes the Corsican Republic democratic. This is from the fourth source I provided previously (translated from French):

Spoiler:
This is a 9-page document that, more than a constitution in the contemporary sense of the term, appears as a rolling text, defining some principles of government, but still very short. Paoli and constitution received in the eighteenth century a tremendous reputation, they then fell somewhat into oblivion, overshadowed by a constitution that will be greater, that of the United States. This constitution is a new principle: the right of peoples, the people are the only legitimate source of able. Popular sovereignty is affirmed in the opening sentences of the text: "The general diet of People of Corsica, legitimate master of himself... ". Freedom is considered a natural right 'having regained his freedom" the nation is understood as sovereign people "wanting to give his government a durable form and permanent by turning it into a Constitution that ensures the happiness of the nation." At the head of state, General of the nation that relies on assemblies. A state council of 142 members elected, subject to the rotation functions, organized into three rooms, the first charge of political affairs, the second of the war, the third business economic. It has an executive role. A general diet, which receives the accountability of general officers. Its members are elected by universal suffrage. It is the legislative branch is an independent assembly not sitting where the General's Office, Pascal Paoli. It enacts laws, fixed tax. She "has a power of censure and impeachment against any member of the executive, including Paoli", a chosen court, three judges and a chancellor. His work will be relayed in the regions by a judge in each of them. Fees for these are specified. As for the laws upon which they rely, they are very hard (to end the feud, "justice" family). This is the judiciary. The Constitution also provides, as part of the country's defense, that the captains and lieutenants weapons will be changed each year.

There, it was fully elected by the people (with no voting restrictions on women or ethnic minorities), and no hereditary positions within the government. A true democratic republic. By definition, no separate bill of rights is required for it to meet that specification (though the rights of the people were nonetheless laid out in the main body of Corsica's constitution itself).

It doesn't matter that it didn't last very long, that's just a triviality. The first plane flight only lasted just 59 seconds, it was still the first ever plane flight. The first transatlantic radio transmission was just the single letter 'S', but it was still the first transatlantic radio transmission. The Corsican Republic lasted just 14 years, but it was still a democratic republic, and it was still before the US.

That article shows how badly the British want to believe that they have a constitution. They acknowledge the fact that Britain doesn't have a constitution and give excuses for why they don't need a constitution with uncodified constitution and government stability excuses.

Just face it. The US is the world's first modern democracy with the world's first written constitution and bill of rights.

The 1812 war was between the US and the British. Canada as a government didn't exist until 1867. Yet Canadians continue to claim that they beat America, when in reality the US never fought "Canada" and has more of right to claim victory than the British (because the US won the last major battle and ended British impressment, which was what started the war in the first place). So how could Canada have participated in the 1812 war, when at that time "Canada" was only known as a region of North America? It seems to me Canadians are looking for something to get patriotic about, but facts are facts. Is there nothing else Canadians can use for patriotism besides this fiction that's based on nothing but historically false mythology?

Here's an article from the March 2012 issue of the Canadian magazine Walrus titled "That Time We Beat the Americans".

 http://walrusmagazine.com/article.ph...-the-americans 

 

Why would you base your thoughts on Canada just on one article and start assuming that all Canadians think likewise? We wouldn't have an undefended border from sea to sea if one won over the other. No one won the war and that was the decision made between Canada and the US.

Canada may not be "created" at that point, but it did exist as a British colony. It was British North America after all, so I can't say that your argument is true.

There are no claims to victory. Both countries have finished disputing its borders, so why bother arguing on who won the war?
 
 
 
Yes, it would be strange. And California would never say that because they know the entire US did. For example, Scotland or Wales alone wouldn't claim the any British victory.

 

But generally Californians would include themselves when giving America credit for it right? As in, they would take pride in the event, despite the fact California didn't exist at the time and therefore wasn't involved.

 
The rules are common sense and historical. If you country didn't exist you can't take credit. But there are exceptions to every rule, and a union such as that would fall under exception because it makes sense.

 

So why doesn't Canada count? It was the union of the British North American colonies (which were even called Lower and Upper Canada). Even after becoming a united Canada, it was still a part of the British Empire.
 
 
 
  That's a new level of denial

 

A constitution is by no means an American idea, they have been around for thousands of years. I'm not really sure why you think America invented them?
 
 
 
With that logic, every government in history has a constitution, which is obviously not the case.

 

Every single government in history did have a constitution.
A constitution is the rules by which an organisation is run. That's all.
Everysingle authority on the English language agrees with me. You haven't provided anything to contradict that.

 
I never said the words "resent" and "spite" were used.

 

Can you provide any contempary articles from the government, media or academia that even implies 'resent' or 'spite'? No? Thought not.

 
That article shows how badly the British want to believe that they have a constitution. They acknowledge the fact that Britain doesn't have a constitution and give excuses for why they don't need a constitution with uncodified constitution and government stability excuses.

 

Did you even read the article? Have you read any of the numerous sources I have provided that prove you wrong? Are you suggesting you have a greater understanding on the matter than Oxford University, or the OED, or British Parliament?

 
An uncodified constitution is not a constitution, so how can a country base their actual constitution on something that doesn't exist? Think about it.

 

If an uncodified constitution wasn't a constitution, it wouldn't have the term constitution in it. Your ignorance is astounding. You can't just change the meaning of a word to suit your pathetic argument. As I said earlier, it's you versus major universities, linguistic organisations and Parliament. Guess who wins? I'll give you a hint- it's not you.
 
 
 
But the US beat the British Empire, which was once the strongest in the world, twice.

 

Your grasp of history is tenuous, to say the least. The major reason American independence was secured was that France and Spain fought against Britain. Rebel military and, especially, naval strength would not have been enough on their own. I know it goes against the grain for some Americans to acknowledge the French as a military nation but the US would not have been cretaed at that time without the French.

The War of 1812 ended because (a) it was a war Britain never wanted in the first place - to echo modern US rhetoric, it was a distraction in the fight for the freedom of Europe against a tyrannical, land-grabbing, totalitarian state; (b) Canada had been secured against US invasion; and, mainly (c) the US economy was on its knees as a consequence of the strengthening British naval blockade that commenced in 1814 and which, if continued, would have done serious damage to the US. Britain free of the war against France could not have been beaten by the USA of the time. Indeed, New England was considering secession and this may have been a factor in the peace. To claim this as an American victory is, frankly, childish.
 
 
 
Actually this information is fully incorrect. The US was the first to write a written constitution. Time matters

I like Americans. I like Canadians even more.

Therefore, Canadians beat Americans and everything they claim is true.
 
 
Let's face it. America's a fairly new country, has barely any history so they try to cling on to whatever they can for example "We saved your ass in WW2"..

I like your logic. Does it apply to ones own country? Since I naturally like Britain more than America, can I claim that we won the American revolutionary war?

Actually, it has a lot of history, with over 300 years of progress and a lot of diverse culture. The US has just achieved a lot in that time.

America has made some impressive advances, I'll give you that, but you've never beaten the French in a war though. In my books, until you give the French a good thrashing, you haven't 'made it' as a nation.

Isn't that slightly too easy though? How long from france declaring war on hitler until they were occupied? A few months? Didn't they build a big wall between germany and france which the germans parachuted over? Besides, I'm thankful to them, because they helped to fight for our country!

 
The AP and UPI reported that the French Government announced after the London bombings that it has raised its terror alert level from Run to Hide. The only two higher levels in France are Surrender and Collaborate. The rise in the alert level was precipitated by a recent fire which destroyed France's white flag factory, effectively disabling their military.

Yet you quote the following in your post, after negging the post in which I mentioned that many Americans disrespected France's military achievements. You have rather proved my point, eh?

I forgot to mention earlier that one important result of the War of 1812 was the freeing by the British and Canadians of over 3,000 people who were enslaved in the land of the free.

The USA had a very large anti-slavery movement and it wasn't long after that that the US banned slavery. It was a different time back then. Also, britain and canada didn't do it for the right reasons either. It was an attempt to choke and kill the USA for trying to remain out of an empire and for trying to maintain freedom.
 
 
 
The USA had a very large anti-slavery movement and it wasn't long after that that the US banned slavery..

 

Slavery finally became illegal in the USA in 1865. If you call that not long after you have a different sense of the passage of time to me.

 
The USA had a very large anti-slavery movement
 

Unfortunately, it wasn't large enough, was it?

I'm not jealous, but it is a lie when people say 'oh america has no history' - it has over 300 years of history and culture, and the culture is derived from many places in europe.
 
 
Why are you making 300 years sound like alot?

That's why I said 'matters to you too '. I don't remember claiming that it doesn't matter to me.

 
Where's this source?

How is the head of state chosen?

And how can a democratic republic not have a bill of rights that protects civil rights such as freedom of speech?

Just face it. The US is the world's first modern democracy with the world's first written constitution and bill of rights.
 

The source I provided before,  here . That and the others are still in my previous post.

I've provided plenty of sources which justify what 'republic' and 'democratic' are, and the existence of a bill of rights is not one of those specifications. The only requirements are that the government are elected, and elected by the people, respectively.

Everybody who wished to sit on the state council put their name forward. The public voted, and 142 were elected to the council. The council would then hold a vote for which of the 142 would head the council, though the decisions of whoever was chosen could nonetheless be vetoed by the council. Yes, I already know what you're going to say:
'But the council chose the Corsican head of state, not the people.'

In short, my reply to you: 'But the electoral colleges pick the US president, not the people.' I assume of course that you know the method by which the US president is elected? Those appointed to the electoral college in each state pick their preferred candidate. The popular vote that the public engage in is not legally binding and is nothing but a guide to aid the state's electoral college, therefore 'the people' don't elect the president at all. Did you know that when Washington was elected, there wasn't a popular vote of any kind? The government admit themselves that the electoral colleges choose of their own free will  here , and what's more - unlike the electors of the head of state in the Corsican Republic - those who are in the US electoral colleges are not themselves elected to that position. While there may be a precedent for the electoral colleges to go with the public opinion, or they are told to when picked, there is nothing in the constitution which actually forces them to do so. So while US elections may be de facto democratic, they aren't de jure democratic. I find it hard to believe that if I said this was the Corsican system, you'd still view it as democratic. (I also ask you, how recently was it that the electoral colleges decided to start going with the US public opinion?)

Similarly, there is a precedent by which the UK monarch keeps her nose out of the law and leaves it entirely to the (democratically elected) UK parliament, but nothing legally which actually forces her to do so. The UK is thus de facto a republic & democratic, but de jure a monarchy & dictatorship. If de facto democracy isn't enough for you to view the UK as truly democratic, why should I accept it as enough that the de facto democratic elections of the US are truly democratic?

Either both the US and the Corsican Republic class as democratic, or neither. Seeing as you love your US democracy, I'm assuming that you have no choice but to pick both. Incidentally, I will repeat what I said earlier that at least the Corsican state council was elected when it picked the leader, unlike those in the US electoral colleges.

No, they're not. You're just ignorant. The italian flag has red in it and the irish flag has orange in it, fairly simple. And to add to it his name is Craig - that isn't exactly an Italian name.

Please tell me you didn't just say compare those flags.. Blue and green are nothing alike. Also the mexican flag this emblem-like thing in the middle.
 
 
Living in the epicentre of where the War of 1812 was fought in Canada, it's a matter of pride not so much as a nationalistic idea, rather the descendents of those who fought on "this side" still survive here. We're simply impressed that our ancestors survived that crazy-town series of events -- especially considering the weather and terrain and *total lack of military ability on the part of the local militia.*
 
 
 
Why would you base your thoughts on Canada just on one article and start assuming that all Canadians think likewise? We wouldn't have an undefended border from sea to sea if one won over the other. No one won the war and that was the decision made between Canada and the US.

There are no claims to victory. Both countries have finished disputing its borders, so why bother arguing on who won the war?

 

Canada did not exist as a government entity when the war took place. The treaty was signed between the US and Britain. But because the US achieved all of its objectives, the US has more of a right to claim victory.
 
 
 
But generally Californians would include themselves when giving America credit for it right? As in, they would take pride in the event, despite the fact California didn't exist at the time and therefore wasn't involved..

So why doesn't Canada count? It was the union of the British North American colonies (which were even called Lower and Upper Canada). Even after becoming a united Canada, it was still a part of the British Empire.

 

The California republic or state government did not fight the British, so California would not claim the war. California residents are US citizen so they would celebrate the war as Americans only. And Canada doesn't even apply to this point your trying to make because Canada as a government entity did not exist and Canada is not part of the British Government today.

Does country once part of the British Empire get to claim every british war?
Does Jamaica, India Nigeria, South Africa Hong Kong, etc
 
 
 
A constitution is by no means an American idea, they have been around for thousands of years. I'm not really sure why you think America invented them?

 

This historian explains why:

 
Here's a keynote that explains it better and explains why the US has the worlds first written constitution with the world's first bill of rights.

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA29TbsNmkQ 

Around 5:35 she highlights 4 innovations which make the US constitution the first written democratic republic constitution in the world.

Around 11:32 she further explains why the written constitution was pioneered by the US.

Around 16:19 she begins to explain why Britain has no constitution.

 
 
 
 
Every single government in history did have a constitution.
A constitution is the rules by which an organisation is run. That's all.
Everysingle authority on the English language agrees with me. You haven't provided anything to contradict that.

Can you provide any contempary articles from the government, media or academia that even implies 'resent' or 'spite'? No? Thought not.

Did you even read the article? Have you read any of the numerous sources I have provided that prove you wrong? Are you suggesting you have a greater understanding on the matter than Oxford University, or the OED, or British Parliament?

If an uncodified constitution wasn't a constitution, it wouldn't have the term constitution in it. Your ignorance is astounding. You can't just change the meaning of a word to suit your pathetic argument. As I said earlier, it's you versus major universities, linguistic organisations and Parliament. Guess who wins? I'll give you a hint- it's not you.

 

You must not know what I constitution is because if you did, you wouldn't be making careless statements.

"Uncodified Constitution" is a political term used by countries without constitutions like the UK. It really means absent constitution.
 
 
 
Your grasp of history is tenuous, to say the least. The major reason American independence was secured was that France and Spain fought against Britain. Rebel military and, especially, naval strength would not have been enough on their own. I know it goes against the grain for some Americans to acknowledge the French as a military nation but the US would not have been cretaed at that time without the French.

 

Do you know how war works. In war you use all the resources you have available including your allies. The French were our allies and we defeat the British with them. In WW2 we were your allies, and without us you all would be speaking German at this very moment.

 
The War of 1812 ended because (a) it was a war Britain never wanted in the first place - to echo modern US rhetoric, it was a distraction in the fight for the freedom of Europe against a tyrannical, land-grabbing, totalitarian state; (b) Canada had been secured against US invasion; and, mainly (c) the US economy was on its knees as a consequence of the strengthening British naval blockade that commenced in 1814 and which, if continued, would have done serious damage to the US. Britain free of the war against France could not have been beaten by the USA of the time. Indeed, New England was considering secession and this may have been a factor in the peace. To claim this as an American victory is, frankly, childish.

 

No one wants war, and there's no perfect time for war either. The US was not going to wait for Britain to get good and ready. Again, do you know how war works? The British provoked the 1812 war by threatening US sovereignty with impressment, and America had no choice but to declare war and finish what the British started.
 
 
 
Slavery finally became illegal in the USA in 1865. If you call that not long after you have a different sense of the passage of time to me.

Unfortunately, it wasn't large enough, was it?

 

The British lead and spread slavery all around the world before the US ever gained independence. the British ended their slave trade in 1807, but never ended slavery until 1833, that's only 32 years before the US. The British have done 1000 times more wrongs in regards to slavery, so don't fool yourself.
 
 
 
And Canada doesn't even apply to this point your trying to make because Canada as a government entity did not exist and Canada is not part of the British Government today.

 

Canada existed as a province. It had provincial governments. Later, the province of Canada became an official country. America wasn’t fighting the actual British army, it was fighting the Canadian provincial army.

How did Canada not exist?

Quebec is only a province but it still exists. If Quebec ever split from Canada and formed its own federal government, I doubt anyone would use the same argument against them.

It's not a difficult concept.  

It's like saying America cannot take pride in any of the Thirteen Colonies' achievements.

Make that 162 years, the thirteenth amendment abolishing slavery wasn't ratified by all states until 1995.
 
 
 
That's why I said 'matters to you too '. I don't remember claiming that it doesn't matter to me.

 

And I never said it didn't matter to me.

 
The source I provided before,  here . That and the others are still in my previous post.

I've provided plenty of sources which justify what 'republic' and 'democratic' are, and the existence of a bill of rights is not one of those specifications. The only requirements are that the government are elected, and elected by the people, respectively.

Everybody who wished to sit on the state council put their name forward. The public voted, and 142 were elected to the council. The council would then hold a vote for which of the 142 would head the council, though the decisions of whoever was chosen could nonetheless be vetoed by the council. Yes, I already know what you're going to say:
' But the council chose the Corsican head of state, not the people.'

In short, my reply to you: 'But the electoral colleges pick the US president, not the people.' I assume of course that you know the method by which the US president is elected? Those appointed to the electoral college in each state pick their preferred candidate. The popular vote that the public engage in is not legally binding and is nothing but a guide to aid the state's electoral college, therefore 'the people' don't elect the president at all. Did you know that when Washington was elected, there wasn't a popular vote of any kind? The government admit themselves that the electoral colleges choose of their own free will  here , and what's more - unlike the electors of the head of state in the Corsican Republic - those who are in the US electoral colleges are not themselves elected to that position. While there may be a precedent for the electoral colleges to go with the public opinion, or they are told to when picked, there is nothing in the constitution which actually forces them to do so. So while US elections may be de facto democratic, they aren't de jure democratic. I find it hard to believe that if I said this was the Corsican system, you'd still view it as democratic. (I also ask you, how recently was it that the electoral colleges decided to start going with the US public opinion?)

Similarly, there is a precedent by which the UK monarch keeps her nose out of the law and leaves it entirely to the (democratically elected) UK parliament, but nothing legally which actually forces her to do so. The UK is thus de facto a republic & democratic, but de jure a monarchy & dictatorship. If de facto democracy isn't enough for you to view the UK as truly democratic, why should I accept it as enough that the de facto democratic elections of the US are truly democratic?

Either both the US and the Corsican Republic class as democratic, or neither. Seeing as you love your US democracy, I'm assuming that you have no choice but to pick both. Incidentally, I will repeat what I said earlier that at least the Corsican state council was elected when it picked the leader, unlike those in the US electoral colleges.

 

Wow. You'll do anything to not have the US be the world's first modern democracy with the world's first written constitution and bill of rights. But your points don't add up.

I was wondering why you were hiding how the head of state was chosen, apparently it's because you knew it was going ruin your whole agenda. No true democratic republic would allow for a council to chose the head of state. Not to mention the fact that it destroys separation of powers and checks and balances. The people are supposed to vote for the head of state for it to be a democratic republic.

The US Presidential election via the electoral college is a democratic because, at the end of the day, the people are still voting for the president via representative democracy. In contrast, the people of the Coriscan Republic were never given an opportunity to choose their head of state. The EU currently has the same problem, where those in the EU parliament chose the EU head of state without the peoples vote. And the result is he has no legitimacy. That's not a democratic republic. Nice try though.

Obviously you don't know how the US government works. You only need 2/3 to ratify. So it was 32 years. Nice try.

The treaty was never signed by Canada because "Canada" was not a government entity.

Not to mention the fact that Canadians are actually celebrating a British lose and a US victory, as we achieved all of our objectives.
 
 
 
Does country once part of the British Empire get to claim every british war?
Does Jamaica, India Nigeria, South Africa Hong Kong, etc

 

Not every war, but they can claim the wars they took part in as part of the British Empire. Loads of British colonies and territories fought in World War 1 and 2. Would you seriously claim India for example can't take any credit for their part in World War 2?
 
 
 
You must not know what I constitution is because if you did, you wouldn't be making careless statements.

 

Oxford English Dictionary:

Constitution

Pronunciation: /kɒnstɪˈtjuːʃ(ə)n/

noun

1) a body of fundamental principles or established precedents according to which a state or other organization is acknowledged to be governed

Which then ties into the Wikipedia page on Constitution of the United Kingdom. First sentance it says:

The British constitution is the set of laws and principles under which the United Kingdom is governed

Which then ties into the equivelant American page

The Constitution of the United States is the supreme law of the United States of America

The US constitution is supreme law, not a 'framework' like you keep saying.

Explaining things to you is like talking to a brick wall.

 
This historian explains constituionsm and why the US pioneered them

 

In the left corner, we have a historian with a youtube video with all of 300 views. In the right corner, we have every major dictionary, major universities and their academics, and the Parliament of the United Kingdom.
And the fighter from the right corner wins in a five second knockout!!!

 
"Uncodified Constitution" is a political term used by countries without constitutions like the UK. It really means absent constitution.

 

No, 'uncodified constitution' is a political term meaning a constitution...that isn't codified. It's sort of in the bloody name. Come one then, provide me a source that backs up that view.
 
 
 
Not to mention the fact that Canadians are actually celebrating a British lose and a US victory, as we achieved all of our objectives.

 

We ? How old are you? You are either over 200 (to justify the we ) or under fifteen (to explain the childishness). Try to be a bit more mature and dispassionate.

Why shouldn't the Canadians celebrate their independence from an attempt by an aggressive and predatory neighbour to steal its land? They wouldn't be independent if the US had won.

The British achieved all their war aims as well, by the way, so by your definition they must have won the war too. In any event, the Americans didn't achieve one important but largely unavowed aim, that of grabbing Canadian territory.

 
America had no choice but to declare war
 

You are obviously unaware that the decision to go to war was extremely close, that the war was intensely unpopular in the USA, was called Mr Madison's War at the time, and was fought partly to deflect attention from internal issues. None of the Federalists in Congress voted for it, and the states nearest Canada largely opposed it.

I suggest you get off the childish jingoist bandwagon you are riding and take a cool look at the historical context. You'll certainly learn something and maybe come to understand something of the Canadian view. History is to be learned from, not misused to start petty childish squabbles

Not being able to distinguish between three completely different national flags, one of which is that of your southern neighbour is a bit of a clue to your depth of knowledge. Come back when you are a bit deeper into your education.
 
 
 
Not every war, but they can claim the wars they took part in as part of the British Empire. Loads of British colonies and territories fought in World War 1 and 2. Would you seriously claim India for example can't take any credit for their part in World War 2?

 

well tbf, a lot of indians ended up fighting for the japanese... so they kinda cancelled their own actions out  
 
 
 
The US Presidential election via the electoral college is a democratic because, at the end of the day, the people are still voting for the president via representative democracy.

 

And yet the 91st Congress was prevented from changing that (on the grounds of its undemocratic nature), after the fiasco of the 1968 election, only by a filibuster led by southern states that would have lost their disproportionate influence. A lot of influential and politically astute Americans disagree with you. Once again, go and learn a little of your own history - you might learn something of constitutions and democracy along the way.
 
 
The title of this thread is inaccurate - should be 'Americans are trying to rewrite the history of the 1812 war'
 
 
 
Do you know how war works. In war you use all the resources you have available including your allies. The French were our allies and we defeat the British with them. In WW2 we were your allies, and without us you all would be speaking German at this very moment.

 

The US wasn't as essential in WW2, or at least in the European theatre, as Americans like to think. Without the US, Germany would still have been beaten, albeit with the Soviet Union's sphere of influence somewhat further west. The Pacific was a different matter, but the US was going to be drawn into that conflict regardless due to Japan's ambitions for US territory.

Also, the question of Britons being forced to speak German had been settled by the Battle of Britain, which resolved the possibility of an invasion of the UK by the autumn of 1940 - long before the US entry into the conflict.

Let's get this straight. Imagine it's 2008 again, McCain vs Obama. Let's say that Obama gets 95% of the popular vote (unlikely, but let's imagine), but every single voter in the electoral colleges side with McCain. McCain is now president by an overwhelming margin, despite Obama getting over a hundred million more votes, and there's nothing in the US constitution to stop this happening, and yet you still think that the US constitution is democratic ? How is that more democratic than the Corsican Republic where all of those 142 (including which of them becomes the head of state) were at least elected by the people ?

 
The people are supposed to vote for the head of state for it to be a democratic republic.
 

Great idea, I agree. Maybe you could get that added to the US constitution!
 
 
 
Also, the question of Britons being forced to speak German had been settled by the Battle of Britain, which resolved the possibility of an invasion of the UK by the autumn of 1940 - long before the US entry into the conflict.

 

But the USA lended money and equipment to britain even before it got involved formally. Although british people have the reputation of being just as bad as us when it comes to speaking foreign languages so imaging you all speaking german is hard.

what's wrong with 'lended'? 'i mended my bike', 'i lended money'.

I was saying that britain is about as good as the USA in that regard. It's true - we as a country suck at other languages, and from what I've heard, so does england.

Because it's just plain wrong.

"I mended my bike at the weekend" is correct. "I lended him money" sounds like a four year old speaking.

What difficult points? Lend-lease didn't commence until 1941 - after the Battle of Britain was over.
 
 
 
What difficult points?

 

The fact the US didn't lose the war of 1812. It achieved all its objectives - to stop britain getting involved in the affairs of the USA, to stop impressment (even if the defeat of Napoleon helped.) and to stop an Indian confederacy from forming. (oh, and in giving Canada a good ass-kicking, lol)

The fact the USA was pivotal in WWII (lend-lease, opening of another front etc.), even if you won't admit it.
 
 
 
It achieved all its objectives

 

So did Britain.

The 1812 war was between the US and the British. Canada as a government didn't exist until 1867. Yet Canadians continue to claim that they beat America, when in reality the US never fought "Canada" and has more of right to claim victory than the British (because the US won the last major battle and ended British impressment, which was what started the war in the first place). So how could Canada have participated in the 1812 war, when at that time "Canada" was only known as a region of North America? It seems to me Canadians are looking for something to get patriotic about, but facts are facts. Is there nothing else Canadians can use for patriotism besides this fiction that's based on nothing but historically false mythology?

Here's an article from the March 2012 issue of the Canadian magazine Walrus titled "That Time We Beat the Americans".

 http://walrusmagazine.com/article.ph...-the-americans 

 

Canadian militias were heavily involved in the fight against the US alongside British regulars. i.e. The people of Canada were heavily involved in fighting the US invaders and kicking them out.

Impressment was the reason the US government put forward for entering the war, but it was more of a cassus beli then a real reason. The Royal Navy wasn't the only navy that impressed US citizens. The French navy did it among others, yet the USA didn't go to war with any of them over it.

The USA entered the War of 1812 with its gaze set on taking British territory in Canada while Britain was fully engaged in the fight against Napoleon. In this objective the USA failed. I wouldn't really call the War of 1812 a victory for anyone, but if anyone was in a position to claim victory it was probably Britain. Not only did they successfully defend Canada they managed to burn down the White House and make several successful expeditions into US territory- all while the vast majority of British resources were being dedicated to the war against France. The war for Britain was never anything more then a sideshow.
 
 
 
The fact the US didn't lose the war of 1812. It achieved all its objectives - to stop britain getting involved in the affairs of the USA, to stop impressment (even if the defeat of Napoleon helped.) and to stop an Indian confederacy from forming. (oh, and in giving Canada a good ass-kicking, lol)

 

Well, the US also invaded Canada and got kicked by a bunch of loyalist canucks. From that point of view one could hardly claim victory.
 
 
 
So did Britain.

 

Britain failed to destroy the USA, which it tried to do by blockading the country and kidnapping US citizens.

 
Yes. They came to the party very late (as usual) but I'd have to admit they played a pivotal role.

 

What do you mean 'as usual'? The US wasn't involved in the war - it had no interest in the internal affairs of wars between european empires. It got involved once it was attacked by Japan and once it became apparent that Hitler needed to be stopped.
 
 
 
The US wasn't as essential in WW2, or at least in the European theatre, as Americans like to think. Without the US, Germany would still have been beaten...

 

Hmm, you think? I'm generally the first to point out that it was the soviet union that sacrificed by far the most to win the war, but it would have been a whole lot harder without a) a western front, which i think Britain could not have made alone, b) the scale of allied bombing, which would have been a lot smaller without the americans and c) economic support from the US reaching both the UK and the Soviet union. Things were balanced on a knife-edge at many different points on the eastern front - it wouldn't have taken much to push it in favor of the axis.

In addition, you do have to wonder that if the Soviet Union had overcome anyway and look set to take Europe, would Britain (with no hope of US aid) sit idly by and watch? Or would they have done the unthinkable and allied with our german neighbours to repel the communist threat, as Hitler had hoped in the late stages of the war.

The US foreign policy was purely self-interested and almost fatal, but also crucial? Possibly. Interesting thought experiment.
 
 
 
Britain failed to destroy the USA, which it tried to do by blockading the country and kidnapping US citizens.

 

Britain had no wish to destroy the USA, but that is what would have happened if there had been any delay in signing the Treaty of Ghent. Your country was suffering badly from the blockade.

 
What do you mean 'as usual'? The US wasn't involved in the war - it had no interest in the internal affairs of wars between european empires. It got involved once it was attacked by Japan and once it became apparent that Hitler needed to be stopped
 

He means "as usual". The USA has a record of turning up late to important events like world wars. Are you saying that it took Americans until December 1941 to realise that Hitler needed to be stopped? That doesn't speak well for the country's intelligence, does it? In fact, Hitler declared war on the USA.
 
 
 
Britain failed to destroy the USA, which it tried to do by blockading the country and kidnapping US citizens.

 

Lol, tried to destroy the US?

 
What do you mean 'as usual'? The US wasn't involved in the war - it had no interest in the internal affairs of wars between european empires. It got involved once it was attacked by Japan and once it became apparent that Hitler needed to be stopped.
 

Just because it had no interest doesnt mean it shouldnt have had one. Think about it economically - both now and then Europe and the US heavily relied on each other in regards to exports/imports. Therefore to lose Europe to Germany, which was trying to reduce it's reliance on other countries(ie: become self reliant), would have had a heavy impact on the US's own economy. Errr... to be fair, just because Japan attacked you that doesn't necessarily mean that Hitler needed to be stopped, just that Japan needed to be stopped as they were the ones attacking you, not Germany.
 
 
 
But the USA lended money and equipment to britain even before it got involved formally.

 

US Lend Lease did become vital when it finally started. But something overlooked when people mention Lend Lease is that it didn't start until March 1941, about a year and a half after the war started and a whole nine months after Britain was left entirely alone in its fight against the Axis.

By the time Lend Lease started Britain had won the Battle of Britain, endured the height of the Blitz, nearly kicked the Italians out of North Africa with Operation Compass (The war in North Africa would have been won in 1941 if Britain didn't have to divert resources to defend Greece), turned the East Africa campaign around in Britain's favour, dealt some serious blows to Axis naval power in the Mediterranean and started the bombing campaign of Germany.

Even after Lend Lease started it was another nine months before the USA entered the war, and even then it was only because they were forced too. By the time the USA entered the war the Battle of the Atlantic had reached a turning point with the capture of the enigma machine, the Italians had been fully kicked out of East Africa and the Vichy French out of Syria/Lebanon, the Axis-supported rebellion in Iraq had been put down, the pro-Axis Persian regime had been toppled by Britain and the USSR, the bombing campaign was stepping up, the Royal Navy had achieved domination of the Mediterranean and perhaps most importantly the USSR and Germany were engaged in their titanic struggle which is what would ultimately spell doom for the Nazi Regime.

Not counting the fact that is was many more months after the USA entered the war before meaningful US resources were in Europe to engage in the war. The USA didn't join Britain in the bombing campaign in any meaningful way until March 1943 (two years after Lend Lease and more then a year after the USA went to war), didn't join Britain in the Battle of the Atlantic in any meaningful way until mid-1942 and didn't engage in any meaningful land actions until the Anglo-American Operation Torch in November 1942 (nearly a year after the USA entered the war and more then three years after the war started). By that time Britain had ensured victory in the Battle of the Atlantic and had all but won the North Africa campaign. Not mentioning the fact that Germany had practically lost any chance of beating the USSR (If it ever had a chance in the first place)

Now credit where credit is due- US Lend Lease greatly helped in achieving these aims and it was very welcome indeed. But lets not pretend it was some selfless US gesture. The USA had its own interests at heart and its not like it was charity- Britain was busy paying back its debts until 2006. It was basically the very least the USA could do and still say it had some role in stopping one of the biggest menaces the world has ever seen (before it joined the war). Not to mention it was primarily British merchant navy men (amongst others- there were many Norwegians in the British merchant navy for example) who were in the business of risking their lives in order to bring these supplies across the Atlantic. Of course when the USA did properly start to get involved in Europe in 1943 it went all out and you can't fault it on that.

You have to understand that when you have Americans who were never even alive in the war (let alone involved in it) spouting off stupid comments like "We saved your asses!!1!!11" it hits a nerve, especially considering that for some of the most desperate and destructive days of the war for Britain when it was standing alone and cities were being bombed into the ground with women and children blown up the USA was absolutely no where in sight, Lend Lease or otherwise. It was instead sitting across the Atlantic with its fingers in its ears.

The fact of the matter is the USA chose the opportune moment to get involved. The USA wouldn't be in the position it is today if it hadn't sat back and watched the unprecedented destruction and done absolutely nothing for a few years before finally getting involved at a point in which some of its chief rivals (Britain, Germany and the USSR) had been severely weakened and were more reliant on the US then they would of been had the USA entered in 1939. Similar case for World War 1 in many ways. The USA has historically thrived off of the destruction of the World Wars due to its reluctance to get involved. Britain on the other hand pretty much spelt its own downfall by throwing everything it had into these wars.
 
 
I feel I should chip in here with a few things...

the US won the war of independance because France Bankrupt itslef trying to stab the Brits in the back. Also Spain and other countries helped.

I think Brits like Canada because Canada is actually grateful for everything Britain did for it, the US isnt.

thats my two pence. Ive never studied the war of 1812 so I cant really contribute to the subject.
 
 
 
US Lend Lease did become vital when it finally started. But something overlooked when people mention Lend Lease is that it didn't start until March 1941, about a year and a half after the war started and a whole nine months after Britain was left entirely alone in its fight against the Axis.

By the time Lend Lease started Britain had won the Battle of Britain, endured the height of the Blitz, nearly kicked the Italians out of North Africa with Operation Compass (The war in North Africa would have been won in 1941 if Britain didn't have to divert resources to defend Greece), turned the East Africa campaign around in Britain's favour, dealt some serious blows to Axis naval power in the Mediterranean and started the bombing campaign of Germany.

Even after Lend Lease started it was another nine months before the USA entered the war, and even then it was only because they were forced too. By the time the USA entered the war the Battle of the Atlantic had reached a turning point with the capture of the enigma machine, the Italians had been fully kicked out of East Africa and the Vichy French out of Syria/Lebanon, the Axis-supported rebellion in Iraq had been put down, the pro-Axis Persian regime had been toppled by Britain and the USSR, the bombing campaign was stepping up, the Royal Navy had achieved domination of the Mediterranean and perhaps most importantly the USSR and Germany were engaged in their titanic struggle which is what would ultimately spell doom for the Nazi Regime.

Not counting the fact that is was many more months after the USA entered the war before meaningful US resources were in Europe to engage in the war. The USA didn't join Britain in the bombing campaign in any meaningful way until March 1943 (two years after Lend Lease and more then a year after the USA went to war), didn't join Britain in the Battle of the Atlantic in any meaningful way until mid-1942 and didn't engage in any meaningful land actions until the Anglo-American Operation Torch in November 1942 (nearly a year after the USA entered the war and more then three years after the war started). By that time Britain had ensured victory in the Battle of the Atlantic and had all but won the North Africa campaign. Not mentioning the fact that Germany had practically lost any chance of beating the USSR (If it ever had a chance in the first place)

Now credit where credit is due- US Lend Lease greatly helped in achieving these aims and it was very welcome indeed. But lets not pretend it was some selfless US gesture. The USA had its own interests at heart and its not like it was charity- Britain was busy paying back its debts until 2006. It was basically the very least the USA could do and still say it had some role in stopping one of the biggest menaces the world has ever seen (before it joined the war). Not to mention it was primarily British merchant navy men (amongst others- there were many Norwegians in the British merchant navy for example) who were in the business of risking their lives in order to bring these supplies across the Atlantic. Of course when the USA did properly start to get involved in Europe in 1943 it went all out and you can't fault it on that.

You have to understand that when you have Americans who were never even alive in the war (let alone involved in it) spouting off stupid comments like "We saved your asses!!1!!11" it hits a nerve, especially considering that for some of the most desperate and destructive days of the war for Britain when it was standing alone and cities were being bombed into the ground with women and children blown up the USA was absolutely no where in sight, Lend Lease or otherwise. It was instead sitting across the Atlantic with its fingers in its ears.

The fact of the matter is the USA chose the opportune moment to get involved. The USA wouldn't be in the position it is today if it hadn't sat back and watched the unprecedented destruction and done absolutely nothing for a few years before finally getting involved at a point in which some of its chief rivals (Britain, Germany and the USSR) had been severely weakened and were more reliant on the US then they would of been had the USA entered in 1939. Similar case for World War 1 in many ways. The USA has historically thrived off of the destruction of the World Wars due to its reluctance to get involved. Britain on the other hand pretty much spelt its own downfall by throwing everything it had into these wars.

 

a very clear well thought out argument, however, it wont get you anywhere, he is incapable of admitting he is wrong and believes the world owes him something because hes american, he will just reword his points and complain your ignoring him, or just ignore you
 
 
 
Britain had no wish to destroy the USA, but that is what would have happened if there had been any delay in signing the Treaty of Ghent. Your country was suffering badly from the blockade.

 

And yet after the war, the US experienced huge economic growth and territorial expansion. Yes, the US had financial trouble, but most countries do when they are involved in wars that threaten their very existence. Wasn't britain almost bankrupt after WWII?

 
He means "as usual". The USA has a record of turning up late to important events like world wars. Are you saying that it took Americans until December 1941 to realise that Hitler needed to be stopped? That doesn't speak well for the country's intelligence, does it? In fact, Hitler declared war on the USA.
 

So, you complain when the US takes too long to get involved in WWII, but apparently the US is evil for getting involved in the middle-east. lol.

 
Lol, tried to destroy the US?

 

uh huh, probably in retaliation for embarrassing britain by declaring independence and showing the world freedom.

 
Just because it had no interest doesnt mean it shouldnt have had one. Think about it economically - both now and then Europe and the US heavily relied on each other in regards to exports/imports. Therefore to lose Europe to Germany, which was trying to reduce it's reliance on other countries(ie: become self reliant), would have had a heavy impact on the US's own economy. Errr... to be fair, just because Japan attacked you that doesn't necessarily mean that Hitler needed to be stopped, just that Japan needed to be stopped as they were the ones attacking you, not Germany.
 

The US would have continued trading with a Nazi European empire, heck it probably would have led to the defeat of the USSR more quickly too.

 
the US won the war of independance because France Bankrupt itslef trying to stab the Brits in the back. Also Spain and other countries helped.

 

Woah there, yes France may have helped, but the people in the colonies rebelled against Britain and they fought hard for freedom themselves.

 
I think Brits like Canada because Canada is actually grateful for everything Britain did for it, the US isnt.
 

lolwut? Yes, everything Britain did for the USA - Massacre Americans, tax them heavily and then refuse to represent them in parliament? Even after the USA declared independence Britain tried to choke the US economy to death and tried to side with the Confederates during the Civil War.

But Germany was economically stronger and is it not possible that Germany could have won by attrition against Britain? Just hold on long enough to bankrupt britain.

I don't believe that, but equally I get annoyed when people think that the US did absolutely nothing during the war and that we claim all the credit. Don't forget the US had experienced the worst financial disaster in its history and was still experiencing slow economic growth, not to mention people didn't much feel like defending Europe's empires.

This is a genuine question, but why did Britain get involved in WWII? I can't see any moral reasons - it had no qualms about killing off rebelling groups throughout the empire and forcing its citizens to die for their country. It can't have been popular reasons either, especially with WWI and conscription on everyone's minds. It can't have been political reasons, the Nazis were against Communist Russia and your King liked the Nazis too and Britain could easily make up excuses to get out of any international obligations. It can't have been for economic reasons, Britain almost bankrupted itself in the war and also Hitler was fond of Britain if I recall and actually wanted to be allies - he looked up to the British Empire as the perfect implementation of his 'master race' thing. I genuinely don't get the reasons why Britain got involved.

You really do have an issue with me, hehe.
 
 
 
You could only vote in britain if you had land, that's not democracy. The US may not have invented democracy, but it did invent modern democracy and it was the first nation that actively tried to spread democracy and combat imperialism.

 

And, at the same time, you could only vote in America if you had a penis.

Er... the invasion of Poland?

That's the reason britain declared war on Germany, but what about all the other treaties Germany broke?

Neville Chamberlain's policy of appeasement involved making concessions with Hitler (e.g. removing the rules against conscription, having more than 6 warships, letting him annex Czechoslovakia, etc.) in the Treaty of Munich (it's been a while since I've studied this so I can't remember the year) to avoid another war. Eventually though, him along with his French counterpart decided not to back down a second time. Granted that it would have been better to have just stood up to him the first time since Germany's military was actually weaker by comparison to ours at the time, but well, what's done is done.
 
 
Both Britain and the US entered WW2 for imperial reasons.

Are you suggesting they could have won without guns or money? it would have been a massacre. also France and spain tied down British resources in other areas too. and Britain had other things going on even then. Dont think they did it because they were being kind, they wanted the colonies for themselves- only they bankrupted themselves and caused their own revolution.

Britain gave thousands of years of civilisation and instant access to the best technology of the era. Law, industry, investment, protection(from france and every other country that would seek a stake of the Americas- without British might behind the colonies it would have been a complete mess), weapons, support, culture and so much more.

The colonies were a tax haven. taxes were risen to make up for the collosoal debt Britain built up expelling France and Spain from the americas in defence of its colonists.

If the 13 colonies had been a spanish colony they would look more like south america. Britain gave nothing but the best to its colonies, and in return received a rebellion over some taxes which they pay now anyway so really what was the point?

Canada stayed loyal though and is arguably the better for it.
 
 
 
Do you know how war works. In war you use all the resources you have available including your allies. The French were our allies and we defeat the British with them. In WW2 we were your allies, and without us you all would be speaking German at this very moment.

 

Thats true, but it works both ways. the USA couldnt have won without Great Britain either.

without the British effort, technology, and empire you would also be speaking German... or Japanese.
 
 
 
But Germany was economically stronger and is it not possible that Germany could have won by attrition against Britain? Just hold on long enough to bankrupt britain.

 

If Britain had continued on alone then it would most likely eventually have been brought to the negotiating table by Nazi Germany- you are right. Britain was never in danger of occupation however. The negotiating table would most likely have meant the loss of the Empire and Britain's power along with it (ironically that is ultimately what victory cost Britain- but at least in victory the Nazi's were destroyed). Britain would have continued to exist as an independent nation, but at a big loss in terms of power and prestige.

 
I don't believe that, but equally I get annoyed when people think that the US did absolutely nothing during the war and that we claim all the credit. Don't forget the US had experienced the worst financial disaster in its history and was still experiencing slow economic growth, not to mention people didn't much feel like defending Europe's empires.
 

Agreed. There is not much excuse for ignorance from anyone, British, American or whoever else.

Britain was no more selfless then anyone else. Like everyone it got involved for selfish reasons. It was long standing British policy to maintain a power balance in Europe so as to stop any one dominant power who could then go onto challenge the empire.

However, I think there was also a realisation that the empire was on the wane and that it wouldn't last. The end of the British Empire was coupled with a sort of self-righteousness and belief in the 'greater good' that wouldn't allow Britain to simply sit back while a madman rampaged on its doorstep. Britain didn't go through all the bloodshed of World War 1 to simply sit back and let Germany get on with it twenty years later. Hitler had already offended British pride with his invasion of Czechoslovakia despite his promise to do otherwise, and the invasion of Poland was the icing on the cake.

Once Britain had started war with Germany there was no going back and it was left with no choice but to throw everything it had into the fray. It cost Britain dearly, but I think the world is better off because of it.
 
 
 
Thats true, but it works both ways. the USA couldnt have won without Great Britain either.

The Japanese never had any chance of taking the American mainland. Pearl Harbour though deviating was a loss for the Japanese as it failed in its main aims, and from that point onwards it was only really a question of time.

But without Britain standing up to Germany, Germany would have been free to win on the Eastern front and take the USSR (Britain opened up two extra fronts the Axis had to fight on). Once Germany had taken the USSR they would have been able to help their Japanese allies achieve their aims of invading America; I'm pretty sure America would not be able to stand up to the might of two super powers (particually seeing as the enigma machine probably wouldn't have been cracked).
 
 
 
And, at the same time, you could only vote in America if you had a penis.

 

And were white.
 
 
 
lolwut? Yes, everything Britain did for the USA - Massacre Americans,

 

Don't know what you mean there, the two were at war, people tend to die in war.

 
tax them heavily and then refuse to represent them in parliament?

 

Tax them heavily? You mean tax them at all, right? The taxes introduced on the colonies were lower than taxes in the UK.

 
Even after the USA declared independence Britain tried to choke the US economy to death

 

Exactly like the US did to the Confederates after they declared independence?

 
and tried to side with the Confederates during the Civil War.

 

What garbage. You've been watching that really bad Nicholas Cage film. National Treasure, or something like that. The UK was never going to side with a slave state, especially not one that tried to extort support.
 
 
 
Canada did not exist as a government entity when the war took place. The treaty was signed between the US and Britain. But because the US achieved all of its objectives, the US has more of a right to claim victory.

 

How did the US achieve all of its objectives? What objectives did it have in the first place that makes it a legitimate reason for them to claim victory?

You didn't seem to read the rest of my comments. Canada did exist as a government entity. It was called British North America.
 
 
 
Don't know what you mean there, the two were at war, people tend to die in war.

 

The Boston Massacre. It happened before the war.

 
Tax them heavily? You mean tax them at all, right? The taxes introduced on the colonies were lower than taxes in the UK.
 

It was the lack of any sort of representation in britain that was the issue.

 
Exactly like the US did to the Confederates after they declared independence?
 

That was different. The confederates left the US illegally and on top of that they were a nation that supported slavery.

 
What garbage. You've been watching that really bad Nicholas Cage film. National Treasure, or something like that. The UK was never going to side with a slave state, especially not one that tried to extort support.
 

I guess I should check historical facts before getting them from movies. I googled it and it appears there is no evidence. It's just that normally these movies are at least based partially on fact. Sorry...
 
 
 
The Boston Massacre. It happened before the war.

 

The soldiers in that incident did fire without order, but come on, they were surrounded by a mob, abused and attacked with bottles and bricks. What exactly do you think they should have done? Write a strongly worded letter to the mob asking them to stop?

 
It was the lack of any sort of representation in britain that was the issue.

 

It was a colony. Why on earth would a colony get representation in a UK parliament? It wasn't part of the UK. Britain's overseas territories today don't have representation in Parliament.

 
That was different. The confederates left the US illegally and on top of that they were a nation that supported slavery.

 

So when the US declares independence, it's a triumph for freedom, but when the Confederates do the same, it's illegal? All revolutions are 'illegal' under the laws of their respective nations. You are criticising the UK for doing something that the USA itself did.
 
 
 
That was different. The confederates left the US illegally...

 

 
 
 
 
Not every war, but they can claim the wars they took part in as part of the British Empire. Loads of British colonies and territories fought in World War 1 and 2. Would you seriously claim India for example can't take any credit for their part in World War 2?

 

If India was a government entity and participated in the war, then it could.
 
 
 
Oxford English Dictionary:

Constitution

Pronunciation: /kɒnstɪˈtjuːʃ(ə)n/

noun

1) a body of fundamental principles or established precedents according to which a state or other organization is acknowledged to be governed

Which then ties into the Wikipedia page on Constitution of the United Kingdom. First sentance it says:

The British constitution is the set of laws and principles under which the United Kingdom is governed

Which then ties into the equivelant American page

The Constitution of the United States is the supreme law of the United States of America

The US constitution is supreme law, not a 'framework' like you keep saying.

Explaining things to you is like talking to a brick wall.

In the left corner, we have a historian with a youtube video with all of 300 views. In the right corner, we have every major dictionary, major universities and their academics, and the Parliament of the United Kingdom.
And the fighter from the right corner wins in a five second knockout!!!

No, 'uncodified constitution' is a political term meaning a constitution...that isn't codified. It's sort of in the bloody name. Come one then, provide me a source that backs up that view.

 

There's no such thing as an uncodified constitution, it's a political term, nothing more or less. I don't know how you guys do it in the UK, but uncodified means nonexistent over here because it's similar to a handshake agreement. Are British schools systems uncodified too. What about the police system, is that uncodified over there? What about your NHS, is that uncodified also. Please tell me what else is uncodified besides this imaginary British constitution.
 
 
 
We ? How old are you? You are either over 200 (to justify the we ) or under fifteen (to explain the childishness). Try to be a bit more mature and dispassionate.

 

"We" refers to we the people of the United States of America.

 
Why shouldn't the Canadians celebrate their independence from an attempt by an aggressive and predatory neighbour to steal its land? They wouldn't be independent if the US had won.

The British achieved all their war aims as well, by the way, so by your definition they must have won the war too. In any event, the Americans didn't achieve one important but largely unavowed aim, that of grabbing Canadian territory.

You are obviously unaware that the decision to go to war was extremely close, that the war was intensely unpopular in the USA, was called Mr Madison's War at the time, and was fought partly to deflect attention from internal issues. None of the Federalists in Congress voted for it, and the states nearest Canada largely opposed it.

 

Canada was not a government entity, nor was any British North Americans fighting for independence. THe BRitish were threatening US sovereignty via impressment and the US had no choice but to declare war. The US objective was to stop impressment and assert its sovereignty. The objective was achieved so the US was victorious. The British no longer did impressment and never threatened US sovereignty again, which is why they lost.

 
I suggest you get off the childish jingoist bandwagon you are riding and take a cool look at the historical context. You'll certainly learn something and maybe come to understand something of the Canadian view. History is to be learned from, not misused to start petty childish squabbles

Not being able to distinguish between three completely different national flags, one of which is that of your southern neighbour is a bit of a clue to your depth of knowledge. Come back when you are a bit deeper into your education.

 

That wasn't me, you replied to the wrong person. How ironic. Your depth of knowledge, is definitely lacking.
 
 
 
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corsican_Constitution 

A 9 page document, which set out the form of the Corsican government up until 1769. Decades before the US constitution of 1789.

 

lol newsflash: wikipedia is not a source. Educate yourself-- anyone can write anything on there. Besides you missed the point-- the US was the actual first working constitution. Nice try, but epic fail.

me---ftw
 
 
 
The US wasn't as essential in WW2, or at least in the European theatre, as Americans like to think. Without the US, Germany would still have been beaten, albeit with the Soviet Union's sphere of influence somewhat further west. The Pacific was a different matter, but the US was going to be drawn into that conflict regardless due to Japan's ambitions for US territory.

 

The British couldn't even fight without US resources, and even with that, they were struggling. The US didn't have to enter the European theater, because it was a European war, but because we were nice we gave Britain supplies and then eventually entered the war.

How is this related to the US being "nice"? The reason why the US entered the war was due to the attack on Pearl Harbour by imperial Japanese forces.

It's true that it was a European war, but dominions like Australia and Canada that were not geographically located in Europe joined the war before you guys.

Don't give me an excuse saying that they had really strong ties with Britain. Canada and Australia made the decision to join the war effort at their own will.
 
 
 
Let's get this straight. Imagine it's 2008 again, McCain vs Obama. Let's say that Obama gets 95% of the popular vote (unlikely, but let's imagine), but every single voter in the electoral colleges side with McCain. McCain is now president by an overwhelming margin, despite Obama getting over a hundred million more votes, and there's nothing in the US constitution to stop this happening, and yet you still think that the US constitution is democratic ? How is that more democratic than the Corsican Republic where all of those 142 (including which of them becomes the head of state) were at least elected by the people ?

Great idea, I agree. Maybe you could get that added to the US constitution!

 

Your whole scenario doesn't apply to the United States of America. The electoral college is not based on the US national popular vote, it's based on the popular state vote. Meaning the candidate that wins the popular vote in a state, wins the state's electoral votes. This is democratic. Also the purpose of the US presidential election and electoral college is to vote for the president. The people of the Corsican Republic were never given the opportunity to vote for their head of state because it wasn't a democratic republic. That's the difference.

I know you won't give up, because you deeply hate the fact that the US is word's first modern democracy with the world's first written constitution and bill of rights.

Good luck finding another "republic"
 
 
 
Canadian militias were heavily involved in the fight against the US alongside British regulars. i.e. The people of Canada were heavily involved in fighting the US invaders and kicking them out.

Impressment was the reason the US government put forward for entering the war, but it was more of a cassus beli then a real reason. The Royal Navy wasn't the only navy that impressed US citizens. The French navy did it among others, yet the USA didn't go to war with any of them over it.

The USA entered the War of 1812 with its gaze set on taking British territory in Canada while Britain was fully engaged in the fight against Napoleon. In this objective the USA failed. I wouldn't really call the War of 1812 a victory for anyone, but if anyone was in a position to claim victory it was probably Britain. Not only did they successfully defend Canada they managed to burn down the White House and make several successful expeditions into US territory- all while the vast majority of British resources were being dedicated to the war against France. The war for Britain was never anything more then a sideshow.

 

As I've already said:

 
Canada was not a government entity, nor was any British North Americans fighting for independence. THe BRitish were threatening US sovereignty via impressment and the US had no choice but to declare war. The US objective was to stop impressment and assert its sovereignty.

I think Brits like Canada because Canada is actually grateful for everything Britain did for it, the US isnt.

thats my two pence. Ive never studied the war of 1812 so I cant really contribute to the subject.

 

Is it uncommon to use your allies to win a war?  

Canada should be grateful because the British created them. The United States created itself.
 
 
 
Thats true, but it works both ways. the USA couldnt have won without Great Britain either.

without the British effort, technology, and empire you would also be speaking German... or Japanese.

 

Wrong again. America didn't need the British, the British needed America. The US basically defeated the Germans and Japanese at the same time. Then went on to defeat the Soviets later down the road.
 
 
 
How did the US achieve all of its objectives? What objectives did it have in the first place that makes it a legitimate reason for them to claim victory?

We entered the Pacific theater because of Pearl Harbor, the only reason we also entered the European theater, is because we were nice. If we had just fought the Japanese, you all would be speaking German right now.

Australia and Canada jumped in immediately because they were forced due to political and governmental ties with Britain.

There's no such thing as an uncodified constitution, it's a political term, nothing more or less. I don't know how you guys do it in the UK, but uncodified means nonexistent over here because it's similar to a handshake agreement. Are British schools systems uncodified too. What about the police system, is that uncodified over there? What about your NHS, is that uncodified also. Please tell me what else is uncodified besides this imaginary British constitution.

 

Handshakes? NHS? Police? What the hell are you blabbering on about?

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncodified_constitution 

That page pretty nicely sums up what an uncodified constitution is.

An uncodified or unwritten constitution is a constitution in which no single, formal document delineates the powers of a government, and the limits thereof. Instead, an unwritten constitution comprises the body of a country's laws, enacted over time, coupled with an emphasis on political precedent and enshrined parliamentary procedure, to create a framework in which a limited government operates. Although these principles are not codified in a single law, they are still recognized by courts, legislators, and executives as binding upon government, limiting its powers. Thus, a court might cite "the constitution" in forbidding an exercise of power, even though no document actually exists.

I've given you plenty of sources explaining what a constitution is, I've now given you one explaining what an uncodified one is. But yet again, as always, you simply ignore what you don't want to hear and keep repeating the same old nonsense.
 
 
 
That's precisely the reason why Britain had no right to claim the colonies and why they revolted.

 

Anyway, in the real world, Britain had a claim to the colonies because they were founded by Britain, populated with British citizens and had been defended by British troops during the seven years war.

 
Obviously the Confederate was illegal because they had equal representation but tried to revolted. The American colonist didn't have equal representation, so they had every right to revolt.

 

No, the Confederate act was illegal because seccession is not allowed under US law. That's what illegal means- against the law. Equal representation is irrelevant. By that logic, Scotland can never ever secceed from the United Kingdom because it has representation in the House of Commons.
 
 
 
The soldiers in that incident did fire without order, but come on, they were surrounded by a mob, abused and attacked with bottles and bricks. What exactly do you think they should have done? Write a strongly worded letter to the mob asking them to stop?

 

Maybe you can understand why the colonists were not happy with the way Britain was running things. For what it's worth, most colonists didn't believe or even want to break away from Britain at first, they just wanted fairer treatment.

 
It was a colony. Why on earth would a colony get representation in a UK parliament? It wasn't part of the UK. Britain's overseas territories today don't have representation in Parliament.
 

Because it had a significant population and more importantly, because the taxes left the USA and went to Britain, why should they not have a say in what those taxes are spent on?

 
So when the US declares independence, it's a triumph for freedom, but when the Confederates do the same, it's illegal? All revolutions are 'illegal' under the laws of their respective nations. You are criticising the UK for doing something that the USA itself did.
 

Those were different circumstances, for one thing the Confederates broke away from the USA for no reason other than greed and a lack of desire to see slavery abolished.

 
 

 

What is so funny?
 
 
 
We entered the Pacific theater because of Pearl Harbor, the only reason we also entered the European theater, is because we were nice. If we had just fought the Japanese, you all would be speaking German right now.

 

What a load of garbage. Jerry had no hope of ever beating Britain so long as the Royal Navy was around.

 
Australia and Canada jumped in immediately because they were forced due to political and governmental ties with Britain.

 

No, it's because they actually liked us. I can understand why you would think that though, since I know being liked is not a feeling you Americans are used to.

This is what New Zealand Prime Minister Michael Savage said as New Zealand declared war on Germany-

"It is with gratitude in the past, and with confidence in the future, that we range ourselves without fear beside Britain, where she goes, we go! Where she stands, we stand!"
 
 
 
Maybe you can understand why the colonists were not happy with the way Britain was running things. For what it's worth, most colonists didn't believe or even want to break away from Britain at first, they just wanted fairer treatment.

 

Oh don't get me wrong, I believe the colonists had genuine greviances, all I'm saying is when you form a mob and start attacking soldiers, you can't really cry victim if the soldiers retaliate.

 
Because it had a significant population and more importantly, because the taxes left the USA and went to Britain, why should they not have a say in what those taxes are spent on?

 

Obviously the taxes went back to Britain; the UK was the one administering the colonies. The real issue was that a seat in Parliament would give the colonies influence over British domestic policy.

 
Those were different circumstances, for one thing the Confederates broke away from the USA for no reason other than greed and a lack of desire to see slavery abolished.

 

Pure Confederate bashing aside, it's all irrelevant. The USA blockaded a rebel state, the UK did the same. You seem to love criticising the UK for acts that America is guilty of.

 
What is so funny?

 

I can imagine he is laughing at the ridiculousness of what you said. That because the CSA secceeded from almighty America, it must somehow be illegal and the USA can do whatever it likes to put that state down, where as when another state secceeds it's in the name of freedom and democracy so blockades are unsportsmanlike.
 
 
 
Your whole scenario doesn't apply to the United States of America. The electoral college is not based on the US national popular vote, it's based on the popular state vote. Meaning the candidate that wins the popular vote in a state, wins the state's electoral votes. This is democratic. Also the purpose of the US presidential election and electoral college is to vote for the president. The people of the Corsican Republic were never given the opportunity to vote for their head of state because it wasn't a democratic republic. That's the difference.

I know you won't give up, because you deeply hate the fact that the US is word's first modern democracy with the world's first written constitution and bill of rights.

Good luck finding another "republic"

 

I think you seriously don't understand your own political system. Whilst electoral colleges by convention vote according who wins a given state, there's nothing to stop the electoral college representatives disregarding the views of the voters and voting for whomever they want. Hell, there are many accounts where this has actually  happened ...
 
 
 
The British couldn't even fight without US resources, and even with that, they were struggling. The US didn't have to enter the European theater, because it was a European war, but because we were nice we gave Britain supplies and then eventually entered the war.

 

I notice how you totally ignored Azog's excellent post on how Britain had already avoided defeat and the Soviets were advancing westward before the US even got involved. I'll repost just in case you missed it.

 
US Lend Lease did become vital when it finally started. But something overlooked when people mention Lend Lease is that it didn't start until March 1941, about a year and a half after the war started and a whole nine months after Britain was left entirely alone in its fight against the Axis.

By the time Lend Lease started Britain had won the Battle of Britain, endured the height of the Blitz, nearly kicked the Italians out of North Africa with Operation Compass (The war in North Africa would have been won in 1941 if Britain didn't have to divert resources to defend Greece), turned the East Africa campaign around in Britain's favour, dealt some serious blows to Axis naval power in the Mediterranean and started the bombing campaign of Germany.

Even after Lend Lease started it was another nine months before the USA entered the war, and even then it was only because they were forced too. By the time the USA entered the war the Battle of the Atlantic had reached a turning point with the capture of the enigma machine, the Italians had been fully kicked out of East Africa and the Vichy French out of Syria/Lebanon, the Axis-supported rebellion in Iraq had been put down, the pro-Axis Persian regime had been toppled by Britain and the USSR, the bombing campaign was stepping up, the Royal Navy had achieved domination of the Mediterranean and perhaps most importantly the USSR and Germany were engaged in their titanic struggle which is what would ultimately spell doom for the Nazi Regime.

Not counting the fact that is was many more months after the USA entered the war before meaningful US resources were in Europe to engage in the war. The USA didn't join Britain in the bombing campaign in any meaningful way until March 1943 (two years after Lend Lease and more then a year after the USA went to war), didn't join Britain in the Battle of the Atlantic in any meaningful way until mid-1942 and didn't engage in any meaningful land actions until the Anglo-American Operation Torch in November 1942 (nearly a year after the USA entered the war and more then three years after the war started). By that time Britain had ensured victory in the Battle of the Atlantic and had all but won the North Africa campaign. Not mentioning the fact that Germany had practically lost any chance of beating the USSR (If it ever had a chance in the first place)

Now credit where credit is due- US Lend Lease greatly helped in achieving these aims and it was very welcome indeed. But lets not pretend it was some selfless US gesture. The USA had its own interests at heart and its not like it was charity- Britain was busy paying back its debts until 2006. It was basically the very least the USA could do and still say it had some role in stopping one of the biggest menaces the world has ever seen (before it joined the war). Not to mention it was primarily British merchant navy men (amongst others- there were many Norwegians in the British merchant navy for example) who were in the business of risking their lives in order to bring these supplies across the Atlantic. Of course when the USA did properly start to get involved in Europe in 1943 it went all out and you can't fault it on that.

You have to understand that when you have Americans who were never even alive in the war (let alone involved in it) spouting off stupid comments like "We saved your asses!!1!!11" it hits a nerve, especially considering that for some of the most desperate and destructive days of the war for Britain when it was standing alone and cities were being bombed into the ground with women and children blown up the USA was absolutely no where in sight, Lend Lease or otherwise. It was instead sitting across the Atlantic with its fingers in its ears.

The fact of the matter is the USA chose the opportune moment to get involved. The USA wouldn't be in the position it is today if it hadn't sat back and watched the unprecedented destruction and done absolutely nothing for a few years before finally getting involved at a point in which some of its chief rivals (Britain, Germany and the USSR) had been severely weakened and were more reliant on the US then they would of been had the USA entered in 1939. Similar case for World War 1 in many ways. The USA has historically thrived off of the destruction of the World Wars due to its reluctance to get involved. Britain on the other hand pretty much spelt its own downfall by throwing everything it had into these wars.

 

The US didn't enter the European theatre because they were nice, they entered because Hitler declared war on them at the same time as Pearl Harbour. Whilst FDR was pleased with the outcome, being pro-european, the US populace would never have tolerated a unilateral entry in the European theatre.

There were three main combatants in the WW2; UK, US, and the USSR. Of these the USSR was the most vital in defeating Germany - there was no way in hell the US/UK could beat Germany without 90% of the Wermachts being tied up in the East. Similarly, without Britain, it's hard to envision how the US could have beaten Germany. D-day from New England across the Atlantic? Not to mention the Axis powers would have conquered Africa and most of southern asia without the British Empire. The US, whilst very much welcomed in the war, is the only element of the three that could possibly seen as non-essential in the war.
 
 
 
Obviously the Confederate was illegal because they had equal representation but tried to revolted. The American colonist didn't have equal representation, so they had every right to revolt.

 

The American Revolution was still illegal under the law they were subject to (which was British law). If it were legal then it wouldn't have been a revolution. So they didn't have a legal right to it, but they had an ethical or "natural" right. By today's standard it probably would have been legal under international law, but at the time that didn't exist in the form it does today, and the only law that applied was British law (which was unjust in many ways, I'm not claiming any moral superiority here).

The Confederate may not have had good ethical justifications for secession, but it was still illegal in the same sense the American Revolution was.
 
 
 
What is so funny?

 

Just that you seem to think that if you agree with something then it is 'legal', if you don't then its 'illegal'.

A revolution is a revolution - representation has nothing to do with it. The US colonies don't get representation, but i'm going to guess that declaring your 'independence' does not get you out of paying said taxes. What do you think?
 
 
 
Is it uncommon to use your allies to win a war?  

Canada should be grateful because the British created them. The United States created itself.

 

France wasnt any ally, they were there for their own intentions. they werent helping the colonies because they liked them. they wanted them and hated the British. the US was lucky France had no money after they won or you d be French now.

The 13 colonies were created by Britain, the foundations of the Us. without those colonies and the strong power and support of Britain, the Us wouldnt exist.
 
 
 
Wrong again. America didn't need the British, the British needed America. The US basically defeated the Germans and Japanese at the same time. Then went on to defeat the Soviets later down the road.

 

Thats really offensive and undermines all those British and commonwealth who died during ww2. thats also offensive to Russia who payed the highest price in WW2.

If Britain fell, then Russia fell. If both those countries fell who are Germany and Japan (and their allies) going to be focusing on?.

Without Britain giving all its tech to the US you wouldnt have the A bomb or the Mustang fighter plane etc. the US would have been blockaded and starved without British tech germany would have got the A bomb and used it.

without Britain you couldnt touch Germany, Britain tied down German and Japanese resources for years and provided the only base for attack in Europe. for one year of the war it was Britain vs Germany, Russia, Japan and Italy so dont tell me that without Britain you could have won because that makes me sick.

And dont offend the Japanese they were within a whisker of absolutely destroying you. without those carriers conveniently being at sea it would have been like taking candy from a baby so get down of your pedestool and read a history book.

The 1812 war was between the US and the British. Canada as a government didn't exist until 1867. Yet Canadians continue to claim that they beat America, when in reality the US never fought "Canada" and has more of right to claim victory than the British (because the US won the last major battle and ended British impressment, which was what started the war in the first place). So how could Canada have participated in the 1812 war, when at that time "Canada" was only known as a region of North America? It seems to me Canadians are looking for something to get patriotic about, but facts are facts. Is there nothing else Canadians can use for patriotism besides this fiction that's based on nothing but historically false mythology?

Here's an article from the March 2012 issue of the Canadian magazine Walrus titled "That Time We Beat the Americans".

 http://walrusmagazine.com/article.ph...-the-americans 

 

My guess is, although they didn't have a government then, they were still a British colony with strong British ties. They still had strong ties with the UK after gaining their independence in 1867, and they still do. The queen is the head of their state remember, and the UK had always allowed those part of its Empire (the commonwealth) to participate in its wars, and I'm guessing as Canada is next to the US, war was on their doorstep, whether they liked it or not. I'm not really liking the jingoism coming from you, because regardless you are disrespecting the fact that Canadians were employed by the British Army and laid down their lives for their beliefs. Just because they lacked a central government, doesn't mean, that they didn't have an identity. Americans seem to pride themselves on the merits of the United States during the American Civil War, even though constitutionally, politically and administratively that US is different to the present day US and on so many levels. So, what's your objection to Canadians, taking pride in the merits of those that can before them that lived in a British enclave as opposed to an independent state?

It may be wikipedia, but that doesn't mean that the constitution didn't exist. I tend to use wikipedia because it has become the standardised source for forum discussions.

The Corsican constitution was a 'working constitution'. (Name a constitution which isn't a working constitution?)

Incidentally, because of my discussion with drknoble, I've only been discussing democratic republics. What was England's Instrument of Government (1653) if it was not a constitution? Or San Marino's constitution (1600)? A constitution is a document which laid out the form of government, all my examples here did that.

Yes, supposedly you vote by state, I know that, but it doesn't hold up either. As my previous government  source  says:

 
There is no Constitutional provision or Federal law that requires electors to vote according to the results of the popular vote in their States.
 

The votes of the electoral colleges have nothing constitutionally to do with the popular vote in each state.

Obama could get 95% of the popular vote in a state, but if the state electoral college side with McCain then McCain wins the state. If this happens in every state then McCain becomes president, despite Obama overwhelmingly winning the popular vote. The constitution allows this. The popular vote (at state nor national level) has nothing to do with who becomes head of state. This is your idea of democracy?

Do I really need to find another democratic republic? Right now you can't even demonstrate that the US qualifies as one, or ever has done.
 
 
 
Are you suggesting they could have won without guns or money? it would have been a massacre. also France and spain tied down British resources in other areas too. and Britain had other things going on even then. Dont think they did it because they were being kind, they wanted the colonies for themselves- only they bankrupted themselves and caused their own revolution.

 

You mean they didn't do it so one day America could invent pizza? Damn.

 
Britain gave thousands of years of civilisation and instant access to the best technology of the era. Law, industry, investment, protection(from france and every other country that would seek a stake of the Americas- without British might behind the colonies it would have been a complete mess), weapons, support, culture and so much more.
 

Britain shipped people here when anyone broke the law. It was not about givin the colonies the best, but instead it was about extracting resources such as cotton and not putting capital back into the colonies.

 
The colonies were a tax haven. taxes were risen to make up for the collosoal debt Britain built up expelling France and Spain from the americas in defence of its colonists.
 

It was about representation, not the actual taxation itself. Britain began exploiting the colonies for its own gain as well as abusing colonists.

 
If the 13 colonies had been a spanish colony they would look more like south america. Britain gave nothing but the best to its colonies, and in return received a rebellion over some taxes which they pay now anyway so really what was the point?
 

I think it was to do with the mindset of early Americans - that hard work and good moral values would improve society.

 
Canada stayed loyal though and is arguably the better for it.
 

I'll admit that Canada is not a bad place, but I don't think I could accept being ruled by another country.

Haha  , admittedly being French might not have changed the US that much, but you dont actually want to be French do you? british colonists under french rule? I mean come on. And like already said, Pizza is Italy.

British colonists to America werent criminals. thats the original Australian colonists. The colonists themselves went to exploit the land and resources, hows it any different? the colonists win and the protectorate wins. dont be a hypocrite.

Fair enough. I would be annoyed if I didnt get a vote. technically as originally the colonists were British citizens they should have got a vote. Canada isnt ruled by britain anymore.

It wasnt about Morals. If Britain lost the war for america youd look like mexico, the spanish exploited their colonies, the British built theres up.

You do owe more than you think to Britain though. Im not saying write a thank you letter to the queen but you shouldnt be so bias towards the US, your famous on here for bashing Great Britain.

although modern america is far away from what the US used to be, its hardly British at all anymore. more french, german or Spanish. honestly, what do you think your founding fathers would think of the Usa if they could see it today?.

It depended. There were vast differences between the colonies of Virginia and the colonies of New England in the 17th Century.

In Virginia the vast majority of colonists were indentured servants- basically people who would work for no pay for 3-7 years to pay for their journey across the Atlantic. At the end of their terms they were freed and given a wage (not usually a big one however). Virginia was purely a commercial venture in which profits were the prime motivation. It wasn't a good place to live or work and death rates were very high due to disease and famine.

New England was a very different story however. New England was literally treated as a New-England. It was home to Puritans and other religious people who wanted to create a new and better society and were encouraged by England (and later Britain) to do so. New England was in no way a commercial venture- it was an ideological and practical one. It also served the purpose of alleviating an overcrowded Britain. The people of New England were allowed their own local government assemblies, universities were established and they were basically left to their own devices.

By the 18th Century things were starting to change and the colonies were seen as desirable places to live. The colonies were treated very well and given generous funding and protection by the British government. In terms of profits, it was Britain's Caribbean colonies that were far more profitable to Britain and where profit was the prime motive. Jamaica alone was worth much more then the 13 Colonies combined. The 13 Colonies were still given a very large amount of leeway compared to Britain's other colonies, and they were largely self-governing with the British government staying out of colonial affairs most of the time.

 
It was about representation, not the actual taxation itself. Britain began exploiting the colonies for its own gain as well as abusing colonists.
 

Like I mentioned, the Thirteen Colonies were never really about financial or economic gain- certainly not like Britain's other far more profitable colonies elsewhere.

The problems started upon Britain winning the Seven Years War

By the time the Seven Years War had been won, Britain had acquired vast new amounts of land in a short space of time and wasn't sure what to do with them. At this time the colonies were basically self-governing with clear political elites, with each colony and town having its own representative assemblies (although they were not acknowledged as equivalent to the British Parliament). Following the Seven Years War in which the colonists had played a large part, they believed them better able to look after themselves.

Britain felt it needed to keep more of a reign on the rapid expansion of the colonies and felt that the colonists should help fund their own defence and expansion. It tried to introduce several taxes to pay for the colonists defence, but each time the taxes were never passed due to opposition from the colonists (you have to remember that the colonists had a large amount of support in the British Parliament).

Things continued this was for a few decades. Then, upon the Boston Harbour incident, the British government (or elements of it at least) saw fit to introduce laws that for the first time could be considered oppressive in order to keep control over the increasingly uncontrollable colonies. This coincided with a greater integration of the colonies and the forming of an 'American' identity.

There was also the fact that Britain had made agreement with Native Americans not to expand any further into their land. The colonists didn't like this however as they wanted to continue expanding Westwards into the more fertile land. This is why the colonists immediately resumed their wars with the Indians upon Independence.

The War of Independence was led by the colonial elites in the interests of the colonial elites. It was never a popular Revolution as such, and things post-Independence were very similar to things pre-Independence. The average colonist was no better off- the main differences was the ruling colonial elites had solidified their power. That was basically the only immediate difference. Like Britain, it was a long time before the majority of the American population were enfranchised.

You also have to remember that only around 35-45% of the colonists supported the Patriot cause. 15-20% were Loyalist and the remainder had no affiliations- they just wanted to get on with their lives.

You also have to remember that many of the values put forward in the War of Independence were seen as British values that had been lost in the British Isles but were still going strong in the colonies. For a long time the colonists saw themselves as more British then the British.

[QUOTE=DYKWIA;36508844]The Boston Massacre. It happened before the war.

An American court found them innocent, or guilty of at most manslaughter. Besides, the crowd were throwing rocks at them. You try throwing rocks at a soldier/policemen and expect them not to do anything. It was just used as propaganda by those in favour of independence.

 
It was the lack of any sort of representation in britain that was the issue.

 

If only you guys would learn from our mistakes... (referring to Puerto Rico, Guam, etc.)

Isn't there also something about Washington DC? As the capital district it doesn't have the same level of representation as the states. I don't know the details, but I've heard about something along those lines.

edit- found this on Wikipedia:

"Residents of the District of Columbia have no voting representation in Congress. They are represented in the House of Representatives by a non-voting delegate, currently Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C. At-Large), who may sit on committees, participate in debate, and introduce legislation, but cannot vote on the House floor. The District has no representation in the United States Senate. Unlike residents of U.S. territories such as Puerto Rico or Guam, which also have non-voting delegates, D.C. residents are subject to all U.S. federal taxes.[175] In the financial year 2007, D.C. residents and businesses paid $20.4 billion in federal taxes; more than the taxes collected from 19 states and the highest federal taxes per capita.[176]"

Is this accurate?
 
 
 
We entered the Pacific theater because of Pearl Harbor, the only reason we also entered the European theater, is because we were nice. If we had just fought the Japanese, you all would be speaking German right now.

Australia and Canada jumped in immediately because they were forced due to political and governmental ties with Britain.

 

If you were nice, you would be joining the war right when it started.

They were not forced. They voluntarily joined the war. I don't know if you are being ignorant or just failing to read all the comments, but it seems like you don't know your historical facts.

You don't even realize that you're proving my point. An uncodified constitution means it doesn't exist. A constitution is written frame work of the government. And an uncodified constitution is like a handshake agreement because it's not official.
 
 
 
Anyway, in the real world, Britain had a claim to the colonies because they were founded by Britain, populated with British citizens and had been defended by British troops during the seven years war.

 

No. Literally in the real world, Britian had no right to claim a land or people that they weren't giving proper representation too. And that's why the US revolted and succeed.

 
No, the Confederate act was illegal because seccession is not allowed under US law. That's what illegal means- against the law. Equal representation is irrelevant. By that logic, Scotland can never ever secceed from the United Kingdom because it has representation in the House of Commons.

 

Of course secession is illegal which is why Confederate revolt was illegal. And they didn't have the right to either because they were given proper representation.

Scotland shouldn't have the right to secede. But you British have a weak union which allows this. To us Americans the idea that Scotland can vote to secede from the UK is mind boggling and ridiculous. Can London secede from the UK as well?
 
 
 
What a load of garbage. Jerry had no hope of ever beating Britain so long as the Royal Navy was around.

 

Keep lying to yourself. And who's Jerry?

 
No, it's because they actually liked us. I can understand why you would think that though, since I know being liked is not a feeling you Americans are used to.

This is what New Zealand Prime Minister Michael Savage said as New Zealand declared war on Germany-

"It is with gratitude in the past, and with confidence in the future, that we range ourselves without fear beside Britain, where she goes, we go! Where she stands, we stand!"

 

How naive of you. Of couse the Prime Minister is going to say that, it's called diplomacy.

Canada, Australia and New Zealand declared war because of the governmental and political ties they had to Britain. For example, it wasn't until 1986 that Australia removed the British Government's ability to make their laws.
 
 
 
I think you seriously don't understand your own political system. Whilst electoral colleges by convention vote according who wins a given state, there's nothing to stop the electoral college representatives disregarding the views of the voters and voting for whomever they want. Hell, there are many accounts where this has actually  happened ...

 

There are many moments in history where rules are broken because rules can be broken in every system. However that doesn't change the fact that the electoral college is democratic. In a democracy it's the people's responsibility to keep the government in line.
 
 
 
I notice how you totally ignored Azog's excellent post on how Britain had already avoided defeat and the Soviets were advancing westward before the US even got involved. I'll repost just in case you missed it.

The US didn't enter the European theatre because they were nice, they entered because Hitler declared war on them at the same time as Pearl Harbour. Whilst FDR was pleased with the outcome, being pro-european, the US populace would never have tolerated a unilateral entry in the European theatre.

There were three main combatants in the WW2; UK, US, and the USSR. Of these the USSR was the most vital in defeating Germany - there was no way in hell the US/UK could beat Germany without 90% of the Wermachts being tied up in the East. Similarly, without Britain, it's hard to envision how the US could have beaten Germany. D-day from New England across the Atlantic? Not to mention the Axis powers would have conquered Africa and most of southern asia without the British Empire. The US, whilst very much welcomed in the war, is the only element of the three that could possibly seen as non-essential in the war.

 

After Pearl Harbor, The US could have entered the European theater much later and just let the British and Soviets fight while focusing on Japan. But we entered earlier because we were nice, and because we knew it was better to wedge the Germans.

I never said the US was the only piece to defeating Germany. I said The British were struggling even with US resources and money, and if it wasn't for the US entering when it did, the Germans could have put all their forces into Russia and potentially defeated them.
 
 
 
The American Revolution was still illegal under the law they were subject to (which was British law). If it were legal then it wouldn't have been a revolution. So they didn't have a legal right to it, but they had an ethical or "natural" right. By today's standard it probably would have been legal under international law, but at the time that didn't exist in the form it does today, and the only law that applied was British law (which was unjust in many ways, I'm not claiming any moral superiority here).

The Confederate may not have had good ethical justifications for secession, but it was still illegal in the same sense the American Revolution was.

 

The keyword I used was "right". The Confederates had no right because they had equal representation. The American colonist had the right to revolt because the British wouldn't give them equal representation.
 
 
 
France wasnt any ally, they were there for their own intentions. they werent helping the colonies because they liked them. they wanted them and hated the British. the US was lucky France had no money after they won or you d be French now.

The 13 colonies were created by Britain, the foundations of the Us. without those colonies and the strong power and support of Britain, the Us wouldnt exist.

 

For that war the French were our ally.

The US created itself, we broke away from British tyranny by ourselves and created the world's first modern democracy with the world's first written constitution and bill of rights by ourselves.
 
 
 
Thats really offensive and undermines all those British and commonwealth who died during ww2. thats also offensive to Russia who payed the highest price in WW2.

If Britain fell, then Russia fell. If both those countries fell who are Germany and Japan (and their allies) going to be focusing on?.

Without Britain giving all its tech to the US you wouldnt have the A bomb or the Mustang fighter plane etc. the US would have been blockaded and starved without British tech germany would have got the A bomb and used it.

without Britain you couldnt touch Germany, Britain tied down German and Japanese resources for years and provided the only base for attack in Europe. for one year of the war it was Britain vs Germany, Russia, Japan and Italy so dont tell me that without Britain you could have won because that makes me sick.

And dont offend the Japanese they were within a whisker of absolutely destroying you. without those carriers conveniently being at sea it would have been like taking candy from a baby so get down of your pedestool and read a history book.

 

I don't mean it literally, that why I said basically.

But in regards to British tech  

US tech invented the plane, mass produced the car, gas mask, etc, all of which wouldn't have allowed WW1 or 2 to take place how it did.

Churchill was begging FDR to enter the war for so long, this proves that Britain needed America more than it need Britain
 
 
 
My guess is, although they didn't have a government then, they were still a British colony with strong British ties. They still had strong ties with the UK after gaining their independence in 1867, and they still do. The queen is the head of their state remember, and the UK had always allowed those part of its Empire (the commonwealth) to participate in its wars, and I'm guessing as Canada is next to the US, war was on their doorstep, whether they liked it or not. I'm not really liking the jingoism coming from you, because regardless you are disrespecting the fact that Canadians were employed by the British Army and laid down their lives for their beliefs. Just because they lacked a central government, doesn't mean, that they didn't have an identity. Americans seem to pride themselves on the merits of the United States during the American Civil War, even though constitutionally, politically and administratively that US is different to the present day US and on so many levels. So, what's your objection to Canadians, taking pride in the merits of those that can before them that lived in a British enclave as opposed to an independent state?

 

Canada didn't exist as a government entity then, not to mention they're celebrating an imaginary victory, which was actually a British lose because the US achieved all of its objectives.
 
 
 
You don't even realize that you're proving my point. An uncodified constitution means it doesn't exist. A constitution is written frame work of the government. And an uncodified constitution is like a handshake agreement because it's not official.

 

I've already provided sources that explain what a constitution is, what an uncodified one is and what a codified one is. You on the other hand have done nothing of the sort, instead choosing to merely parrot the same old nonsense. Your woeful ignorance of the English language is not valid evidence in a debate.
 
 
 
No. Literally in the real world, Britian had no right to claim a land or people that they weren't giving proper representation too. And that's why the US revolted and succeed.

 

No, literally in the real world, claims aren't based on whether people have proper representation. That's a naive fantasy. The Falkland Islanders don't have representation in UK Parliament but that doesn't change the fact that Britain has a solid claim over it.

 
Of course secession is illegal which is why Confederate revolt was illegal. And they didn't have the right to either because they were given proper representation.

 

The first part of that is right. The second is not and I'd bet as much that you can't produce a source that says as much.

 
Scotland shouldn't have the right to secede. But you British have a weak union which allows this. To us Americans the idea that Scotland can vote to secede from the UK is mind boggling and ridiculous. Can London secede from the UK as well?

 

Seccession is illegal under British law as it stands. But if the Scottish referendum passes, the idea that Britain would block independence on the grounds that Scotland has representation in Parliament is ridiculous. You Americans preach on and on and on about freedom, yet you evidently don't care about the right to self representation.
 
 
 
Yes, supposedly you vote by state, I know that, but it doesn't hold up either. As my previous government  source  says:

The votes of the electoral colleges have nothing constitutionally to do with the popular vote in each state.

Obama could get 95% of the popular vote in a state, but if the state electoral college side with McCain then McCain wins the state. If this happens in every state then McCain becomes president, despite Obama overwhelmingly winning the popular vote. The constitution allows this. The popular vote (at state nor national level) has nothing to do with who becomes head of state. This is your idea of democracy?

Do I really need to find another democratic republic? Right now you can't even demonstrate that the US qualifies as one, or ever has done.

 

A constitution is a framework, not every single detail is supposed to be written. If it were, the US constitution wouldn't be only 4 pages long, but 1000 pages or even a collection of books. Maybe you're so confused because you don't even know what a constitution is.

I'm sorry you don't like the fact that the US is the world's first modern democracy with the world's first written constitution and bill of rights. But you're gonna have to get over it and accept reality.

In the meantime, keep searching for that "republic". Eventually you'll realize that what you're searching for is the USA.
 
 
 
If you were nice, you would be joining the war right when it started.

They were not forced. They voluntarily joined the war. I don't know if you are being ignorant or just failing to read all the comments, but it seems like you don't know your historical facts.

 

We were nice, which is why we helped when we did. Those of you wishing the US entered earlier are ungrateful and selfish. Let me remind you, that was a european issue, and at that time the US was insular. You all wanted us to be the police of the world, now we are, you complain.

As I said:

 
Canada, Australia and New Zealand declared war because of the governmental and political ties they had to Britain. For example, it wasn't until 1986 that Australia removed the British Government's ability to make their laws.

You on the other hand have done nothing of the sort, instead choosing to merely parrot the same old nonsense. Your woeful ignorance of the English language is not valid evidence in a debate.

 

Definition of codified:
1. Arrange (laws or rules) into a systematic code.
2. Arrange according to a plan or system.

Un-codified is the exact opposite. This means that an uncodified constitution is one which has NOT been written and arranged into a systematic code, plan or system. So if a constitution hasn't been codified, then it doesn't exist.
 
 
 
Keep lying to yourself.

 

Keep making yourself look like a tool. Do prey tell, how exactly does Jerry get around the Royal Navy and defeat Britain?

 
And who's Jerry?

 

Who do you think? Germany.

 
How naive of you. Of couse the Prime Minister is going to say that, it's called diplomacy.

 

How cynical of you. Just because people don't like America...

 
Canada, Australia and New Zealand declared war because of the governmental and political ties they had to Britain. For example, it wasn't until 1986 that Australia removed the British Government's ability to make their laws.

 

There was no legal requirement for the Dominions to join Britain in war, and indeed a) New Zealand declared war on Germany before Britain did, that's hardly towing the line and followng their master is it and b) The Dominions had already asserted their right to a independent foreign policy when they refused orders to send troops to Greece during the Turkish war of independence.
So once again, you're wrong.
 
 
 
Obviously you don't know how the US government works. You only need 2/3 to ratify. So it was 32 years. Nice try.

 

Obviously you don't know how it works, which is surprising seeing as you're the American, you only need 2/3 of states to ratify for the amendment to pass into law, but it only passes into law in the states which have ratified it. Thus slavery wasn't abolished from Mississippi until they ratified the amendment in 1995.

No, that is only the case if the definition of a constitution was as you claimed it to be, but I have already proven that it is not. A constitution is a set of principles and laws on which an organisation runs itself. You either have a codified one like the USA where the laws are written down onto a single statute, or an uncodified one like the UK where the constitution is derived from numerous legislations passed over centuries. I have backed up my stance with numerous sources which you have failed constantly to rebute.
 
 
 
If part of the USA voted to leave the union I'd not want to stop them.

 

What if it was your home state?
 
 
 
No, literally in the real world, claims aren't based on whether people have proper representation. That's a naive fantasy. The Falkland Islanders don't have representation in UK Parliament but that doesn't change the fact that Britain has a solid claim over it.

 

The Falkland Islanders also have a right to revolt.

 
The first part of that is right. The second is not and I'd bet as much that you can't produce a source that says as much.

 

Why would I provide a source for common sense? Every State in the US gets 2 senators for the senate and House representatives based on their population for the House of Representatives.

But if the Scottish referendum passes, the idea that Britain would block independence on the grounds that Scotland has representation in Parliament is ridiculous. You Americans preach on and on and on about freedom, yet you evidently don't care about the right to self representation.

 

Apparently Secession isn't illegal if Scotland gets to vote themselves out. If you agree with voting to secede, why shouldn't London, Manchester, Liverpool or even a British Family's home get to vote to secede. Fact of the matter is, the UK isn't a strong union.
 
 
 
What if it was your home state?

 

I wouldnt really want it, but if the people wanted to leave then I'd accept that. There'd probably be a good reason for it if so many wanted to leave. That said, I think the proportion would have to be higher than 50% (maybe 2/3 majority) voting for independence. However, Obama's got more chance of telling the truth for once than PA voting to leave the USA.
 
 
 
Obviously you don't know how it works, which is surprising seeing as you're the American, you only need 2/3 of states to ratify for the amendment to pass into law, but it only passes into law in the states which have ratified it. Thus slavery wasn't abolished from Mississippi until they ratified the amendment in 1995.

 

Obviously you don't know what you're talking about. Once 2/3 have ratified, it's federal law and all states must comply.

I have backed up my stance with numerous sources which you have failed constantly to rebute.

 

Firstly, a constitution has to be written, to be a constitution. Secondly, it has to be single staute. Thirdly, it definitely is NOT a collection of laws passed over the years or that would mean every country in the history of the world has a constitution, which is obviously not the case.
 
 
 
The Falkland Islanders also have a right to revolt.

 

Then so did the Confederates.

 
Why would I provide a source for common sense? Every State in the US gets 2 senators for the senate and House representatives based on their population for the House of Representatives.

 

As I thought, you can not. The right to self-determination, which by the way is and was trumpeted constantly by America, is a recognised clause of the UN Charter.

 
Apparently Secession isn't illegal if Scotland gets to vote themselves out

 

Unilateral seccession still wouldn't be legal, the referendum isn't binding.

 
If you agree with voting to secede, why shouldn't London, Manchester, Liverpool or even a British Family's home get to vote to secede. Fact of the matter is, the UK isn't a strong union.

 

Now you're being ridiculous, even more so than usual. None of those cities have independence movements and none are recognised as a distinct culture and nation. Do you honestly believe that no matter what, Scotland should be for ever binded into the UK until the end of time? The hypocrisy of you Yanks is unbelievable.
 
 
 
Firstly, a constitution has to be written, to be a constitution. Secondly, it has to be single staute. Thirdly, it definitely is NOT a collection of laws passed over the years or that would mean every country in the history of the world has a constitution, which is obviously not the case.

 

I already provide numerous credible sources as to what a constitution actually is. Your ignorance is beyond astounding. You're wrong. Utterly, totally and completely wrong. How many sources do I have to provide that prove you wrong before you finally admit it?

Don't group us all together. The confederates were different since it was an elite group tearing away from the USA for the wrong reasons. Also, not all adults had the vote, so states breaking away was not necessarily in the interests of the people.
 
 
Do you really measure the existence of places by when an arbitrary state was proclaimed?

You do know that's not quite borne out by history, yes?
 
 
 
Definition of codified:
1. Arrange (laws or rules) into a systematic code.

Un-codified is the exact opposite. This means that an uncodified constitution is one which has NOT been written and arranged into a systematic code, plan or system. So if a constitution hasn't been codified, then it doesn't exist.

 

Answer me this; what would a codified constitution look like? Do you know? Even in my relatively uninformed mind(Yes, I'm not a lawyer and this is, after all, law) I can tell you it's related to the modern day method of writing laws in articles and sub articles. Also, this just goes to prove that other countries have been civilised for so much longer than the US that when their governing bodies and therefore constitutions were set up it wasn't necessarily considered the logical step to set it out in this format rather than just as a bit of prose(? - I'm not doing an English degree either) or essay.

So in conclusion, boys and girls, we can well and truly add drknoble to the list of Americans not worth the time of day such as Sharri5, DYKWIA, MadeInAmerica.
 
 
 
Firstly, a constitution has to be written, to be a constitution. Secondly, it has to be single staute. Thirdly, it definitely is NOT a collection of laws passed over the years or that would mean every country in the history of the world has a constitution, which is obviously not the case.

 

Oh, so America hasn't made amendments to its own constitution? That's what I thought. You're making yourself look like a fool, although I suppose you're already used to it.

As I said:

 

You make a point when you say the US was insular. However that does not make WWII an European matter. It wasn't. There's a reason why it was called the third reich. Reich means empire and Germany was already employing expansionist policies. With the power of Europe behind it it could have done anything it wanted to really.

Doesn't this remind you of Napoleon?
 
 
 
Firstly, a constitution has to be written, to be a constitution. Secondly, it has to be single staute. Thirdly, it definitely is NOT a collection of laws passed over the years or that would mean every country in the history of the world has a constitution, which is obviously not the case.

 

Of course it's not every single law that's ever been passed, only those relating to government, the way the country is run, and the rights of citizens. The American constitution includes things like "The President is elected every 4 years", "The President gets to veto anything he doesn't like" and "Congress can override that veto with a 2/3 majority vote". The British constitution includes things like "The House of Commons is elected every 5 years", "The Queen appoints a Prime Minister who needs to be confirmed by a parliamentary vote of confidence" and "The Queen has got to give up most of her powers to her Prime Minister". It's still written down, just not in a single document but instead a collection of bills and charters spanning centuries.That's why it's not a written constitution, but a constitution nonetheless.
 
 
 
The keyword I used was "right". The Confederates had no right because they had equal representation. The American colonist had the right to revolt because the British wouldn't give them equal representation.

 

They had the right according to who? They certainly didn't have a legal right to it, because they were subject to British law.

What you are talking about is a "natural" right (I prefer to think of them as ethical rights, as they're still invented by humans in my opinion). As there is no governing body for natural rights (otherwise they would be legal rights), you cannot state they had that right as an absolute fact. It is an opinion. And it's an opinion I happen to agree with.

 
There are many moments in history where rules are broken because rules can be broken in every system. However that doesn't change the fact that the electoral college is democratic. In a democracy it's the people's responsibility to keep the government in line.

 

But the problem is they weren't breaking the rules. Isn't it entirely within the rules to do that? Surely if it was against the rules those electors who vote for someone other than the person the people in their state voted for would be arrested, or face some other sanction?

 
A constitution is a framework, not every single detail is supposed to be written. If it were, the US constitution wouldn't be only 4 pages long, but 1000 pages or even a collection of books. Maybe you're so confused because you don't even know what a constitution is.

 

You are correct. Not every detail has to be written or collected in a single document. Do you know what they call a constitution like that?

 
The Falkland Islanders also have a right to revolt.

 

Well I'd hope they simply ask for representation or independence before they go off and do that. Although it could be argued it would be undemocratic for them to have an MP in the House of Commons because then they would have about 20 times the voting power of anyone in the UK since most constituencies have about 60,000 people and they only have 3000.

 
Apparently Secession isn't illegal if Scotland gets to vote themselves out. If you agree with voting to secede, why shouldn't London, Manchester, Liverpool or even a British Family's home get to vote to secede. Fact of the matter is, the UK isn't a strong union.

 

Secession is illegal unless the UK Parliament enacts it. If the Scottish Parliament, or any other body, declared independence then it would be illegal. Scotland can only become independent by an act of the UK Parliament. I'm against it, but it would be hard to ignore if the people in Scotland clearly vote for it. As you say if Scotland can secede, why not any other place?

I think part of the problem the UK has is that England has such a larger population than the rest of the UK. That means the rest of the UK sees it as England dominating the UK, even though the other parts have their own devolved governments that no one from England gets a say in. The USA has some states that are much larger than others, but at least no state has anywhere near a larger population than the rest of the country combined. The UK could do with taking some ideas from the US, but unfortunately people don't like the idea of splitting England up into multiple "states", even if it would mean they'd get their own devolved governments.
 
 
 
Canada didn't exist as a government entity then, not to mention they're celebrating an imaginary victory, which was actually a British lose because the US achieved all of its objectives.

 

Canada did exist as an annexed state and that deserves recognition, and it did have a government, but one that was controlled by the central government over in the UK. You evidently, aren't too clued up on your history. Americans didn't win the war, nor the British. There was a ceasefire in 1815, which led to the signing of the treaty of Ghent, because both sides were pretty fed up. Read Wikipedia for a brief synopsis, if can't be asked to take a few books out of the library -

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812  and  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Ghent 

Canada was repeated invaded by the US, (particularly Quebec (Lower Canada) and Ontario (Upper Canada)), and every time they fought successfully to repel them back, because Canada it was well acknowledged were the strongers, (this includes the invasion by the US in 1812). At the time of the ceasefire, the US had yet again invaded Ontario and Quebec, but straight after the ceasefire and the signing of the Treaty of Ghent, those parts of Quebec and Ontario that been taken again were returned.

It's never cool, just to blurt out highly opinionated statements, which you can't qualify. Get a book, open it, do a bit of reading and then leave out the jingoism - it's not cool!
 
 
 
I don't mean it literally, that why I said basically.

But in regards to British tech  

US tech invented the plane, mass produced the car, gas mask, etc, all of which wouldn't have allowed WW1 or 2 to take place how it did.

Churchill was begging FDR to enter the war for so long, this proves that Britain needed America more than it need Britain

 

Allies technological co-operation- works both ways. you think the Usa could have won without Britain? read article below.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied_...g_World_War_II 

The Mustang wouldnt have worked without a Rolls Royce engine. (spitfire engine- Spitfire was a ww2 British fighter plane and one of the finest planes ever built imo). British research in radar and the nuclear science was priceless.

of course Churchill was begging for the US to enter the war. the Us supposed to be Britains/frances ally and yet it waited 2 years to join whilst Britain and commonwealth basically fought off the entire axis. And the US was forced into WW2, it was Japan, Germany and Italy that declared war on the US first, so save me the 'US to the rescue!' stuff.

In short the Us entered WW2 because it had no choice, Germany would have beaten the US without British tech and war effort.
 
 
 
For that war the French were our ally.

The US created itself, we broke away from British tyranny by ourselves and created the world's first modern democracy with the world's first written constitution and bill of rights by ourselves.

 

please, Greece invented democracy in 508 bc. it was hardly a revolutionary US invention.

there is no way on earth the Us would exist without France or Spain fighting Britain. as I have clearly explained in my conversation with dwykia.

technically France and Britain created the modern US. Do you know where the US flag comes from? Google 'The British East India Trading Company'.
 
 
 
.

 

Ignoring my post again? come on now, dont start a debate if you cant see it through til the end.

In the meantime, keep searching for that "republic". Eventually you'll realize that what you're searching for is the USA.

 

As I've outlined, the American public don't actually elect the president. Do you have anything to counter this point? Unless you do, it isn't a democracy.

As you said yourself:

 
The people are supposed to vote for the head of state for it to be a democratic republic.
 
 
 
 
So it would be fair to say that Vietnam won?

 

Vietnam didn't win no. The USA pulled out because of public opinion. When a democracy is fighting against an autocratic system of government the democracy has a much lower tolerance for death and cost - especially as we were fighting for freedom in another country, it wasn't our own freedom directly as stake.

However it is important to note that the USA was actually making significant advances by the end of the war and if we had stayed in we would have won. Soldiers were often confused as to why they were pulled out even though they were winning.
 
 
 
I already provide numerous credible sources as to what a constitution actually is. Your ignorance is beyond astounding. You're wrong. Utterly, totally and completely wrong. How many sources do I have to provide that prove you wrong before you finally admit it?

 

Where are these sources? Fact of the matter is Britain has an UNCODIFIED constitution, which means the British constitution doesn't exist.
 
 
 
Answer me this; what would a codified constitution look like? Do you know? Even in my relatively uninformed mind(Yes, I'm not a lawyer and this is, after all, law) I can tell you it's related to the modern day method of writing laws in articles and sub articles. Also, this just goes to prove that other countries have been civilised for so much longer than the US that when their governing bodies and therefore constitutions were set up it wasn't necessarily considered the logical step to set it out in this format rather than just as a bit of prose(? - I'm not doing an English degree either) or essay.

So in conclusion, boys and girls, we can well and truly add drknoble to the list of Americans not worth the time of day such as Sharri5, DYKWIA, MadeInAmerica.

 

A constitution is codified by its nature. That's way an uncodified constitution makes no sense.
 
 
 
Where are these sources? Fact of the matter is Britain has an UNCODIFIED constitution, which means the British constitution doesn't exist.

 

Codified:

 
The collection and systematic arrangement, usually by subject, of the laws of a state or country, or the statutory provisions, rules, and regulations that govern a specific area or subject of law or practice.
 

 Source 

Keywords: collection and systematic arrangement.

Exist:

 
to have actual being; be: The world exists, whether you like it or not.
 

 Source 

Uncodified therefore means that the laws of a certain state or country are not both collected and systematically arranged. Not existing meaning it would have no actual being.

Is that clear enough for you? Or do I need to spell it out for you? You remind me of GWB.
 
 
 
Oh, so America hasn't made amendments to its own constitution? That's what I thought. You're making yourself look like a fool, although I suppose you're already used to it.

 

Obviously the US constitution has amendments. Uncodified constitutions can't have amendments because they don't exist.
 
 
 
A constitution is codified by its nature. That's way an uncodified constitution makes no sense.

 

There is definitely a way for a constitution to be uncodified. Do you think that laws set out in the same way since the dawn of time? Or do you perhaps think that the legal system had to develop into what it is today? Therefore it would make sense that at one point in history that law was completely uncodified, wouldn't it?
 
 
 
You make a point when you say the US was insular. However that does not make WWII an European matter. It wasn't. There's a reason why it was called the third reich. Reich means empire and Germany was already employing expansionist policies. With the power of Europe behind it it could have done anything it wanted to really.

Doesn't this remind you of Napoleon?

 

WW2 was a European war, as most of it took place in Europe.

You fail to see my point.

If that was true then the American constitution would not be a constitution by your own definition.
 
 
 
Of course it's not every single law that's ever been passed, only those relating to government, the way the country is run, and the rights of citizens. The American constitution includes things like "The President is elected every 4 years", "The President gets to veto anything he doesn't like" and "Congress can override that veto with a 2/3 majority vote". The British constitution includes things like "The House of Commons is elected every 5 years", "The Queen appoints a Prime Minister who needs to be confirmed by a parliamentary vote of confidence" and "The Queen has got to give up most of her powers to her Prime Minister". It's still written down, just not in a single document but instead a collection of bills and charters spanning centuries.That's why it's not a written constitution, but a constitution nonetheless.

 

That makes no sense. Every government law passed relates to the government. A constitution is a framework of government on a single document. Britain doesn't have one, therefore doesn't have a constitution.
 
 
 
WW2 was a European war, as most of it took place in Europe.

 

  What do you think would have happened if the third Reich had managed to take over Europe? Do you think it wouldn't continue to expand? Don't you remember that Hitler hoped that the third Reich would exist for a thousand years? By this logic I think we can assume that Nazi Germany would have expanded more than just in Europe. Plus it wouldn't have benefited America economically for Europe to be under Nazi control.

I believe hitlers original intentions didnt include taking over Britain, but instead establishing a German empire of his own. I don't think he would ever have been a match for the USA though, even if he had taken Europe. Besides which, he never seemed to consider us much more than mongrels and I don't think he had the urge to fight us or the belief that he could win.

Do you have any evidence to back up this claim? Or do we just have to take your word for it? The Axis powers only killed 416,800 of your military personnel; of course Germany wouldnt have been a match for the US. /sarcasm
 
 
 
They had the right according to who? They certainly didn't have a legal right to it, because they were subject to British law.

What you are talking about is a "natural" right (I prefer to think of them as ethical rights, as they're still invented by humans in my opinion). As there is no governing body for natural rights (otherwise they would be legal rights), you cannot state they had that right as an absolute fact. It is an opinion. And it's an opinion I happen to agree with.

 

According to human rights.

 
But the problem is they weren't breaking the rules. Isn't it entirely within the rules to do that? Surely if it was against the rules those electors who vote for someone other than the person the people in their state voted for would be arrested, or face some other sanction?

 

They were breaking the rules because they're supposed to vote for the candidate that won the state.

 
You are correct. Not every detail has to be written or collected in a single document. Do you know what they call a constitution like that?

 

Not a constitution.

 
Well I'd hope they simply ask for representation or independence before they go off and do that. Although it could be argued it would be undemocratic for them to have an MP in the House of Commons because then they would have about 20 times the voting power of anyone in the UK since most constituencies have about 60,000 people and they only have 3000.

 

But they have the right to revolt if they don't get representation.

 
Secession is illegal unless the UK Parliament enacts it. If the Scottish Parliament, or any other body, declared independence then it would be illegal. Scotland can only become independent by an act of the UK Parliament. I'm against it, but it would be hard to ignore if the people in Scotland clearly vote for it. As you say if Scotland can secede, why not any other place?

I think part of the problem the UK has is that England has such a larger population than the rest of the UK. That means the rest of the UK sees it as England dominating the UK, even though the other parts have their own devolved governments that no one from England gets a say in. The USA has some states that are much larger than others, but at least no state has anywhere near a larger population than the rest of the country combined. The UK could do with taking some ideas from the US, but unfortunately people don't like the idea of splitting England up into multiple "states", even if it would mean they'd get their own devolved governments.

 

If Scotland gets to vote on secession, then it's not illegal. Does London get to vote on secession?
 
 
 
Canada did exist as an annexed state and that deserves recognition, and it did have a government, but one that was controlled by the central government over in the UK. You evidently, aren't too clued up on your history. Americans didn't win the war, nor the British. There was a ceasefire in 1815, which led to the signing of the treaty of Ghent, because both sides were pretty fed up. Read Wikipedia for a brief synopsis, if can't be asked to take a few books out of the library -

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812  and  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Ghent 

Canada was repeated invaded by the US, (particularly Quebec (Lower Canada) and Ontario (Upper Canada)), and every time they fought successfully to repel them back, because Canada it was well acknowledged were the strongers, (this includes the invasion by the US in 1812). At the time of the ceasefire, the US had yet again invaded Ontario and Quebec, but straight after the ceasefire and the signing of the Treaty of Ghent, those parts of Quebec and Ontario that been taken again were returned.

It's never cool, just to blurt out highly opinionated statements, which you can't qualify. Get a book, open it, do a bit of reading and then leave out the jingoism - it's not cool!

 

Canada did not exist as a government entity when the war took place.

The treaty was signed between The US and Britain, not Canada and the US.

THe US won the war because they achieved all of their objectives and the British didn't.

The Canadians are celebrating fiction.
 
 
 
Allies technological co-operation- works both ways. you think the Usa could have won without Britain? read article below.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied_...g_World_War_II 

The Mustang wouldnt have worked without a Rolls Royce engine. (spitfire engine- Spitfire was a ww2 British fighter plane and one of the finest planes ever built imo). British research in radar and the nuclear science was priceless.

of course Churchill was begging for the US to enter the war. the Us supposed to be Britains/frances ally and yet it waited 2 years to join whilst Britain and commonwealth basically fought off the entire axis. And the US was forced into WW2, it was Japan, Germany and Italy that declared war on the US first, so save me the 'US to the rescue!' stuff.

In short the Us entered WW2 because it had no choice, Germany would have beaten the US without British tech and war effort.

 

US tech was more important then British tech. The same can be said today.

IF we weren't allies, we wouldn't have given the British resources and money, and focused on Japan first.
 
 
 
please, Greece invented democracy in 508 bc. it was hardly a revolutionary US invention.

there is no way on earth the Us would exist without France or Spain fighting Britain. as I have clearly explained in my conversation with dwykia.

technically France and Britain created the modern US. Do you know where the US flag comes from? Google 'The British East India Trading Company'.

 

The Ancient Greeks invented ancient democracy, the US invented modern democracy.

There's no way France or Spain would exist without the US during WW1, WW2 and the Cold War. They would be German or Soviet States by now.

The US created itself by revolting from the tyrannical British.

As I've outlined, the American public don't actually elect the president. Do you have anything to counter this point? Unless you do, it isn't a democracy.

As you said yourself:

 

Obviously it's a representative democratic vote. At this point you're just grasping at straws because you've ran out of potential "republics". I know you need to lie to yourself so you can sleep at night, but the reality is - the US is the world's first modern democracy with the world's first written constitution and bill of rights.

Systematic arrangement. An uncodified constitution has no system nor does it have arrangement.

A constitution is a set of fundamental principles or established precedents according to which a state or other organization is governed.[1] These rules together make up, i.e. constitute, what the entity is. When these principles are written down into a single collection or set of legal documents, those documents may be said to comprise a written constitution.
 

 Source 

This is what a constitution is. It means principles which a country's government must abide by, in this case.

We used to have uncodified laws, even an uncodified Bill of Rights.

 
In the United Kingdom, the Bill of Rights is further accompanied by the Magna Carta, Habeas Corpus Act 1679 and Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 as some of the basic documents of the uncodified British constitution.

If that was true then the American constitution would not be a constitution by your own definition.

 

The US constitution, like all other constitutions, is a framework from which the government bases laws on.

The state elector's job is to vote how the majority of the state voted. The 142 corsican republic members destroyed separation of powers and checks and balances by choosing the head of state without the peoples vote. No democratic republic allows for the legislative branch to elect the executive branch.

I've quoted that source a couple of times which shows that they aren't forced to though, it is merely a precedent. Why not scrap the electors involved and just say "The Democrats won the popular vote in California, they get 55 points", "The Republicans won in Texas, they get 34 points" and so on, and make it automatic ? That would make the system fully democratic. Why have people involved who - despite the popular vote - get to choose ? That isn't democratic.

It isn't as democratic as it possibly could be, no matter what you say. It's a system which was out to be abused, especially in a time before elections were transparent.

No I meant exactly what I said, which makes perfect sense.

 
If country doesn't represent a group of people in the government, then the people have the right to revolt.

 
 
 
 
And I've already said:

 

That really has nothing to do with what I was just saying. If the system can be written so that electoral colleges involve 538 people voting for who they want, it can be rewritten so they are forced to vote in line with the popular vote, or that they are scrapped entirely and the state popular vote gives a direct number of points. It's no good to just keep repeating that it's a 'framework', if it isn't democratic by law then it just isn't, no excuses.
 
 
 
According to human rights.

 

I think we mean the same thing. Back then there was no international court of human rights like there is today, so it still wasn't a legal right in any sense. So I think by human rights you mean the same thing I mean by ethical rights.

 
They were breaking the rules because they're supposed to vote for the candidate that won the state.

 

But there is no law telling them they have to right?

 
Not a constitution.

 

But you just said it was?  

 
A constitution is a framework, not every single detail is supposed to be written.

 

 
But they have the right to revolt if they don't get representation.

 

By ethical/human rights, I agree that it is fair that everyone should get equal representation.

 
If Scotland gets to vote on secession, then it's not illegal. Does London get to vote on secession?

 

If there was significant demand for London independence, yes they probably would. London does have a sort of devolved government already, so in theory if a pro-London independence party got in power there they could push for a referendum. I admit it would be much harder for any random part of England to secede though.

Err, I think you'll find Canada did have a government. It's just that it was under the jurisdiction of another central government (i.e. Parliament in Westminster, London).

And just because a state does not have independence from a governing sovereign state, certainly doesn't mean their actions in war should be ignored. Canada was repeatedly invaded by the US and they repeatedly pushed them out. It's a well-chronicled event, so how can you go round saying it's fiction? When Argentina invaded the Falklands Islands in 1982, it was just as much the Falkland Islanders war (in fact more so) as Britain against Argentina.

During the Second World War, when the Nazis invaded the British Channel Islands, it was just as much their war as the British as a collective, against the Nazis.

Should war ever come to Suriname, it would be the Netherlands as well Surinames war.

The kind of mentality you're displaying is the same sort of mentality that led to people not batting an eyelid at the massacring of American Indians in the American Indians War. "Oh look, they're a simple people without a de jure government, let's invade them, take their lands and commit genocide. No-one will care, because their not a real country."

You can in no way justify, going onto someone's elses turf in an invasion, battling with them, so that they lay down their lives defending where they call "home" and say it's not their war, especially when by default they are the citizens and allies of the sovereign state you are primarily fighting.

Just find any textbook or encyclopaedic web-site:

" Popular views

During the 19th century the popular image of the war in the United States was of an American victory, and in Canada, of a Canadian victory. Each young country saw her self-perceived victory as an important foundation of her growing nationhood. The British, on the other hand, who had been preoccupied by Napoleon's challenge in Europe, paid little attention to what was to them a peripheral and secondary dispute.

Factors leading to the peace negotiations

By 1814, both sides had achieved their main war goals and were weary of a costly war that offered little but stalemate. They both sent delegations to a neutral site in Ghent, Belgium."

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812 

"The treaty largely restored relations between the two nations to status quo ante bellum. (The way it was before the war.)"

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Ghent 

I dunno about you, but that sounds like a ceasefire due to stalemate as opposed to a victory, but maybe you're right and the history books are completely wrong....(I find this pretty unlikely btw.)

At that time, Canada was a British state, ergo anything that concerned Canada concerned Britain and vice versa. A signing between US and Britain, would have definitely concerned Canada (the British state over the border) especially with it's close proximity with the US, and that treaty would have concerned all other states under direct British rule, near and far (e.g. India, Australia, New Zealand, Nigeria), due to the politically and economical repercussions like whether they would impose trade embargos or sanctions on the United States.

Canadians are celebrating the fact that their forefathers drove the enemy (as far as they were concerned) out of their lands...repeatedly, which is a massive feat for what would have been a relative sparsely populated land, even with back-up from the British and other soldiers from the British Empire, serving at the front lines.

I'm not sure if you just being stubborn and belligerent or whether you troll forums, just trying to get a reaction, but you really need to stop being so jingoistic and defamatory.

the US effort in WW1 was minimal, france and Britain won that horrible war. look up the Battle of Amiens.

Look ive given you evidence and youve chosen to ignore it. Instead you keep saying 'The US created itself', yes obvioulsy the colonists played a significant part in creating the Us, but if you think that they could have won without France and Spain, and would have been as successful if they werent a well supported British colony then, quite frankly, your delusional.

I believe hitlers original intentions didnt include taking over Britain, but instead establishing a German empire of his own. I don't think he would ever have been a match for the USA though, even if he had taken Europe. Besides which, he never seemed to consider us much more than mongrels and I don't think he had the urge to fight us or the belief that he could win.

 

Its true Hitler had no desire for war with Britain. Hitler was an Anglophile.

But he would have gone to war with the Us when Japan attacked because they were allies. The Us would have been obliterated. the Us was lucky to beat the Japanese let alone the germans, Austrians, Italians and Japanese. And if he did take over europe they would be near enough completely alone.
 
 
 
lolwut? Yes, everything Britain did for the USA - Massacre Americans, tax them heavily and then refuse to represent them in parliament?

 

The illegal rebellion of 1776 was actually sparked by a tax cut. The smugglers were then unable to compete with the legal companies.

in effect America was born out of a communistic desire to tax companies to death.
 
 
 
I don't mean it literally, that why I said basically.

But in regards to British tech  

US tech invented the plane, mass produced the car, gas mask, etc, all of which wouldn't have allowed WW1 or 2 to take place how it did.

Churchill was begging FDR to enter the war for so long, this proves that Britain needed America more than it need Britain

 

Planes needed jet engines to be any use. British inventions.

Cars weren't terribly useful in ww2, not an AMerican invention anyway. I know you tried to get round it by referring to 'mass production', but that was a red herring.

Gas mask. lolwut?

Tanks = British
Splitting atom which led to H bombs = British
Jet Engine = British
Breaking of the enigma code = BRitish
Radar = British

Try again, my colonial ignoramus.

I wonder what would have happened if Britain did ally themselves with Germany (or if they were conquered). We might have had a more difficult fight. I don't think the us would have lost though, but the fight might have gotten onto us soil.

I don't think Canada or Mexico would have allied themselves with the axis powers so it might have been difficult to get any supplies or troops into the USA and where would they have bombed cities from? The USA was safe with a large army and the fact Germany and Japan were an ocean away from us.

No, the struggles started out of a long held tension that arose from Britain essentially exploiting the colonialists.
 
 
For such a non-issue this thread has really snowballed...

Exploiting? Eh?

Without our help America would have perished. Basically you were like a spoilt child who started to sulk because you didn't have the nous to compete with our successful companies.

This impotence led to you ingrates attacking our ships if a fit of petty rage.

Yeah, fighting for issues like freedom and democracy and sparking numerous rebellions elsewhere - yeah we're really acting like a kid...lol

It was a fight for freedom, not a fit of petty rage.

The only freedom you didn't have was the vote tbh. The same freedom was denied to practically every single person in the Mother country.

You should have discussed it like normal human beings. This 'getting things by violence' mentality has never really slipped out of the American psyche. Hence your numerous, ahem, 'interventions' around the world.

The Boston Tea Party thugs were not the righteous freedom fighter of American mythology; they were smugglers who were annoyed by tax cuts as this made them less competitive.

Lol, it's always funny to see Brits attacking the USA for being an evil, violent country when Britain used to do the exact same thing.

No one in the colonies wanted to use violence to achieve their aims. Heck, they originally didn't want independence at all! It was simply that violence was the only thing british troops understood.

There was never any question of Britain allying with Nazi Germany. It just wouldnt happen and didnt happen. Britain would either have to go for peace or be destroyed. You really have to stop thinking of the Usa as invincible, Germany and Japan were extremelly powerful countries at the time, much more powerful than the Usa was in 1939. the USa was nowhere near as powerful then as it is now. and even now its only because the Usa came out on top in WW2, its slowing losing that edge as time goes by.

In that scenario Canada, other commonwealth nations and mexico could either have continued the fight or entered peace negotiations. But neither of those countries were particularly powerful nations at the time. at least not 1st tier nations like Great Britain, France, Japan, germany, and rising star, the USA.

I dont know how it would have played out to be honest, thats a much to difficult question to answer accuratelly.

Doesn't that also keep Germany safe from America? If hypothetically speaking Britain allied itself with Germany, how exactly do you imagine America would have won? It has absolutely no way to take the fight to Germany.

It would have made a temporary alliance with Russia, would have developed nuclear weapons and it had a strong enough army and navy that it could slowly liberate europe. It's unlikely germany or japan would have ever been able to get to US soil, so really they would have continued to be on the defensive.

In this hypothetically situation the UK is allied with Germany. So how exactly does the US get to Europe? That's what I'm getting at. The only suitable staging base for an invasion of Europe is the British isles or North Africa, both of which in this scenario are obviously unavailable to America.

America would never have made a nuclear weapon before the Germans without the research done by British physicists and the fact basically all our nuclear physicists went over to America half way through the war, just in case Britain got invaded.
