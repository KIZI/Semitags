That has been job 1 for the GOP since the day Obama was elected, you didn't honestly think they ever had other plans, did you?

Is "Defeating Obama" in their Contract on America?
 
 
Country before Obama.
 
 
This was the Democrats plan for the last two years:

Helping get Americans jobs? No. Unemployment is near 10%

Keeping Americans insured. No. ObamaCare grants waivers to some companies.

Ending two wars they voted yes on? No.

Building American infrastructure? Nope.

Reining in Wall Street? Nope.

Forcing BP to clean up their mess? No. The mess is still there. Check out National Geographic.

Building the US Economy? No. Americans still losing jobs

Helping Americans keep their homes? No. Mortgage modification was a giant failure.

All the things Obama is for, everyone is against just look at Tuesdays election results.

These are the reasons the Democrats number one priority is:

Destroying the US Economy along with the US Dollar.

It's that simple.

And yet, we are being taxed at the lowest rate since 1930. How do you explain that?
 
 
 
Country before Obama.

 

Not according to the GOP Leadership.
 
 
Defeat Obama, the rest will follow.
 
 
I think he can walk and chew gum at the same time.

Barry may decide he doesn't want a second term. Now wouldn't that be interesting??

The rest of America's jobs will follow.

Follow the Republicans to China. The GOP will make sure that happens.

You can change your name to "Bok Choy" Girl.
 
 
All cults end badly.
 
 
That and taking the Senate back. Lots more work to be done for sure. The ball is now rolling though.

Maybe.

If he lodges enough government intervention in people's throats that can't ever be undone, his work will be complete.

Mitch McConnell: GOP leader: Defeating Obama is priority one

Darrel Issa: GOP to do what Obama refused to do - Go after Bush!

Both. Darrell Issa says that Obama has been in office only 22 months so most of the problems had to originate with Bush. But he wants to go after Obama. I suspect that no matter what he finds, it will all lead back to Bush. Which means, not much will really happen there.

The real goal is what Mitch said. The Republican party is 90% white. They hate the black guy in the "WHITE" House. That is a given.

8 years of Republicans screwing this country over and they were voted back into office, not because anyone believes they will FIX anything, but because voters are angry that Democrats haven't fixed Republicans mess fast enough.

Seriously, what have Republicans done that's good for this country in the last 20 years. No one believes they will do anything good now. Not even them. That's why their goal is to "get" Obama. Then they can concentrate on moving the rest of America's jobs to China.

The goal is to "gut" this country and so far, they have done a fantastic job. Seriously, you have to hand it to them. They have followed their plan to the letter and so far it's worked way beyond their own expectations.

The next part of the plan is to end the minimum wage, end Social Security, Medicare and Health Care. They've already told us. Didn't anyone watch the campaigns?
 
 
I thought the President was half White? Man,you wouldn't know that listening to Democrat nutters. The President is also a White Man. Seriously it's true. What a bunch of psychos. SHEESH!
 
 
There is the TRUTH: Obamadinejad MUST NOT GET RE-ELECTED.

The guy is already defeated, Sarah is ongoing and will be potus in 2012.
 
 
Poor Mitch, it's really gotta be chafing the old bastard that he has to remain a backbencher. Thanks again, Teahadists.
