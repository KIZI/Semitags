Now we need someone to read the messages to them.
 
 
I need to get my Dad to do one of those.
 
 
Two of those people started businesses.

I wonder if they had any small business loans.

I wonder if they ever heard the word "pride." I actually heard it when I read your sentence.
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

Prove those aren't paid hacks!  
Ooops! I must have been channeling TM.

I have been around long enough to know never to trust the economy, one day all is going well, next month all crashes (like in 2008) thats why I have always kept a few thousand in the bank just in case of any financial interruption. Unfortunately we have a few million people in our country who abused their credit lines, having a field day at best buy/new cars, etc,and at any given time had 1 or 2 months supply cash in the bank. And now a lot of them are protesting on wall street, and others Blame Bush! Hey, did Bush tell anyone to buy a $250,000 home with their $35,000 a year salary?

I wonder if they had any small business loans.

 

I start businesses and can tell you that practically no one is giving small business loans. I've got no debt, hundreds of thousands in the bank, a personal credit score of over 800, a home that I own outright, 20 years experience in my industry, 16 of which were with the same Fortune 100. I'm an ideal risk for a business loan but all banks turned me down, even for a loan as little as $50k. Every other entrepreneur I know tells the same story.
 
 
 
 

 

Dude looks scary to me. Could be a right wing whackjob?

doesnt matter if he can impugn self-made folks and hard work
 
 
Oh, is this that bullshit started by Erick Erickson of RedState?

Here's Jon Stewart on this idea:

Of course they [the other "47%"] do most likely pay payroll taxes, state, local, sales and excise taxes, but the important thing is knowing that doesnt make you as mad, doesnt it?

Nah, there are some nutters among them. Just like with any popular movement.
 
 
Some chick being interviewed today actually said she shouldn't be forced to pay back the $80,000+ in student loans she took out to work on her Masters.... not sure how somebody comes to think this way?
 
 
My message to the protestors is...

Take a bath, comb your hair, put on your big boy pants, get a job, and stop thinking the world owes you something.

Careful.. they may try and poop on you.
 
 
The funny thing is, the authoritarians who push for more government oppression (those supporting the OWS) are of the opinion that these poor, poor folks don't know that they really are oppressed and these authoritarians know better. So these poor, poor folks need to just surrender their free will to those who know what is better for them.

Authoritarians - gotta love the arrogance.

Rosanne Barr says when she becomes President of the United Staes of America and something or other for Israel, then she will forgive all college debt and other stuff too, like anit't that totally rad

I must admit Radio, this thread is doing something to me that NEVER happens during my time here.

I am getting visibly angry as I read these things.

The range from winners from another time when there were a lot more winners, to people who are getting thrashed by the current system yet are licking the hand that's thrashing them...

To this fucking guy, who blames 'Elitist career politicians' for some reason which he doesn't really specify.

What are you trying to say by posting all these? Are you suggesting that there's nothing wrong whatsoever with what's going on in the economy right now? Because that seems to be the position of the people you're giving ear to here.

So whining about the unfairness of it all is a much better way to go instead of making something of yourself?

Elitist career politicians is probably a lot closer to what is wrong with the economy than "Business bad".

Actually, you didn't burst my bubble because no one was denying they did and that's not really the point.
 
 
I'm not going to speak on behalf of Cuyo, because I don't know what motivates his reaction. However, I do think that plenty on the left will get extremely pissed about this response. Listen, they never liked the fact that the right had the nerve to enter their domain of protesting, and were in fact quite successful at it. Now, here they have finally gotten "something" going, and they'll see this as an attack to destroy their "movement". Oh well, they need to accept and deal with the fact that the right will never go back to being "conservative" in expressing their opinions. It's a new day.

I'm not doing this again.... I have already outlined this several times. I am not spoon feeding you or anyone else. You really need to acquaint yourself with all the facts - not just the ones your idiot media provide. Research - and that does not mean fucking google. Read. Educate yourself. Apply logic. This is not hard. It is, however, time consuming.

Well you're right about one thing... You don't speak for me. I'm angry at how susceptible my fellow Americans are to propaganda, and how callous and unsympathetic they are to less fortunate people.

That's among the more ridiculous and hacky (and dare I say - Elitist?) of your posts. I see Cali Girl the GOP stooge has shown up this afternoon.

I don't know who you think 'my media' is, but if you think this was perpetrated by anyone but the private sector, I suggest you take a hard look at your own information sources.

You actually make a fair point, but you still also threw up your own strawman in response.

As far as this site goes, though, still crap. If the message is the usual "don't blame others and pull yourself by your own bootstraps", that ship has sailed. Millions more have to eat them at this point.

So you say. So you believe.

And, he thinks and believes differently than you; but more importantly, what he thinks and believes about HIMSELF holds a hell of a lot more credibility than what you think for him.

But, the nice thing is, he still has the freedom to do that and to make the best of himself, as long as the Constitution is followed.

Ain't America great that way?

I answered you earlier, you never responded back that I saw.  

Behavior of Wall Street as of late? What behavior is that? I see the politicians bailing out their buddies in business and I see politicians crafting tax policies to favor their buddies in business. The common theme being that politicians who make the policies seem to be the issue. Not the businesses that operate under those policies.

Oh well, if you wanna act like nothing's been going wrong on Wall Street, that's fine, but a lot more of us are still glad that there are people WORKING to see that some of these assholes are finally held accountable.

And you're still more part of the 99% than you seem to want to admit.

I thought liberals were supposed to embrace diversity on all levels, including thought...yet you're exhibiting a mindset that maintains a narrow vision of acceptable thinking.

 

Blaming a straw man ('elitist career politiicans') or pretending nothing is wrong when something is terribly wrong? Yeah it upsets me.

Sure they've got the right, and I've got the right to broadcast the sorrow it provokes in me.

 

Again, you're making all sorts of assumptions, but I don't know how you come to those conclusions based on the signs that were posted. It seems you're pretending that these people don't have concerns or compassion because of how they've responded to the occupiers. Well, just because you approve of how the occupiers have presented their grievances, I think it's ignorant to have expected such tactics to be embraced by the mainstream, and especially apolitical, public. I'm not referring to the act of protesting, but the method...and the occupiers aren't going to win over anyone who isn't already in the choir.
 
 
 
 
 
If they're protesting they're not hard at work. True story  

 

Oh well, if you wanna act like nothing's been going wrong on Wall Street, that's fine, but a lot more of us are still glad that there are people WORKING to see that some of these assholes are finally held accountable.

And you're still more part of the 99% than you seem to want to admit.

I'm not going to speak on behalf of Cuyo, because I don't know what motivates his reaction. However, I do think that plenty on the left will get extremely pissed about this response. Listen, they never liked the fact that the right had the nerve to enter their domain of protesting, and were in fact quite successful at it. Now, here they have finally gotten "something" going, and they'll see this as an attack to destroy their "movement". Oh well, they need to accept and deal with the fact that the right will never go back to being "conservative" in expressing their opinions. It's a new day.

 

Well you're right about one thing... You don't speak for me. I'm angry at how susceptible my fellow Americans are to propaganda, and how callous and unsympathetic they are to less fortunate people. (Unsympathetic used literally, not to mean 'empathetic' as it often is. To mean 'not understanding.')

 

I am all for helping the helpless, the clueless are on their own.

see?
 
 
 
 
 
Oh is that right? And how is Congress 'responsible for this mess?'

Other than, ya know, not reining in the bankers sooner?

 

the housing bubble?

 

Yes, I already said 'not reining in the bankers sooner.'

 

you're way smarter than that cuyo, don't be obtuse.

Must be why we hang out here.

Speaking of stupidity, why does Ropey have such a hard-on for you?  
 
 
 
 
 
Uh-uh.

Like I said, no one was denying it, so you were the one putting up a strawman.

And overall, you guys who want to annoint yourselves "53%ers" are largely part of the "99%ers" whether you wish to be or not. You're a minority of the majority.

 

Actually the strawman you put up was that "they pay taxes too"....which no one denied. You needed that pointed out to you?

And way to go with a basic grasp of how percentages work   The message itself though seems to be lost on you.

 

You actually make a fair point, but you still also threw up your own strawman in response.

As far as this site goes, though, still crap. If the message is the usual "don't blame others and pull yourself by your own bootstraps", that ship has sailed. Millions more have to eat them at this point.

row harder.  
 
 
 
 
 
Actually, this is people who work hard for what they have versus people who want to sit around and complain.

Quite interesting that you see it as a Republican versus Democrat thing though. Very telling...  

 

Again, DICK, since you glazed me over completely thus far...

Do you see nothing wrong with the behavior of wall street as of late?

 

I answered you earlier, you never responded back that I saw.  

Behavior of Wall Street as of late? What behavior is that? I see the politicians bailing out their buddies in business and I see politicians crafting tax policies to favor their buddies in business. The common theme being that politicians who make the policies seem to be the issue. Not the businesses that operate under those policies.

 

So you did, my bad.

 
So whining about the unfairness of it all is a much better way to go instead of making something of yourself?

Elitist career politicians is probably a lot closer to what is wrong with the economy than "Business bad".

 

I think you overestimate the preponderance of people who are saying "Business bad." Sure there's probably some singing that tune, but they're just confused. Not everyone immerses themselves in matters of finance, politics, business, etc; But they do know they can't find a job. Why?

Did elitist politicans outsource the jobs? No, but they allowed it to happen.

Did they inflate then burst the housing bubble? No, but they allowed it to happen.

Did they GIVE the six largest banking institutions in this country assets in excess of 60% of our GDP? No, but they allowed it to happen.

Did they personally consolidate companies into huge trusts capable of exploiting resources and crushing smaller businesses? No, but they allowed it to happen.

They DID give the private banking sector undue and dangerous control over the money supply... I'll grant that... But did they force them to exploit that power? No, but they allowed it to happen.

Do you see a pattern emerging here? The government doesn't "DO" any of these things. They only allow it to happen; They only fail to prevent it. And I think that's a big part of the message here - "STOP. LETTING. THIS. HAPPEN."

If you get robbed and beaten up, do you blame the cops for not being there and tell the perpetrators that it's not their fault, because the cops let it happen? That's analogous to what I see when I hear people blaming the big bad government.

I'm tellin' ya man, this will not continue the way it's been going. Maybe this will subside and the unwashed masses will again be placated as a few scraps find them as the next bubble inflates, but eventually there will be more equitable distribution than what we have now; It's inevitable.

...Whew, much better.  
 
 
Wait, I work a 9-5 and I go down to Wall St. after work and on weekends. THOUSANDS of others do this as well. You people don't even know what you're talking about.

Two of those people started businesses.

I wonder if they had any small business loans.

 

I did not get that impression.

Do you mean that the wall street big wigs, spend too much time at the white house (or in close proximity, annonomusly)? Do you mean they give too much money to the democrats (for returned favors) as 'campaign contributions? I thought that was okay when the democrats did it.

Actually in every one of your examples the politicians created the environment in which businesses found it more profitable to pursue those avenues of profit margin rather than their current course. So it still falls back on the politicians.

The protesters, at least as I understand and interpret the movement, are telling their elected officials to stop letting this happen.

And you disagree because, why?

If they were telling the politicians they'd be protesting in Washington DC, not Wall Street. AND working to change the current crop of people/regimes in charge (D and R). They're blaming the wrong people, and are economically clueless. Instead they think camping out and whining to the wrong people, about the wrong things, and making wrong-headed demands will change what has happened. Not gonna work. At all. And is a complete waste of resources/energy and time. On their part AND the people who have to deal with them and their cluelessness.

Oh I disagree, I think what they're doing has certainly got their elected officials' attention. Of course the GOP who is the more laissez faire of the two is quick to demonize and marginalize the protesters, but they have their attention nonetheless.

The choice of Wall Street is symbolic, obviously, I don't think they have any intention of solving the problem there (or any of the other locations being 'occupied.')

And like any other movement, there are some clueless, some no doubt very bright, and a lot of everything in between.

But you agree that a.) the government didn't 'DO this,' but only 'ALLOWED it to happen,' and b.) The government needs to respond to the problem in a meaningful way. Correct?

Then I don't think you're so far off from me, and I don't understand why you ridicule these folks and post these ridiculous GOP stooge 'responses' to the movement.

edit: And I think I said early on and now I re-iterate, what makes me the most sick about this shit is the people acting like nothing is wrong. They worked their way through college 20 years ago, why can't today's lazy kids? BECAUSE THINGS HAVE CHANGED, ASSHOLE, THAT'S WHAT THE MOVEMENT IS ABOUT!

Just look at Pelosi and others, who are part of the frigging problem, trying to "stand with the protestors". And the protestors lap it up. The ones who didn't are the ones who didn't allow John Lewis to speak. At least some of them recognized he is part of the problem too.

And the ones I posted were apolitical. So not sure how you got the idea they were GOP stooges. As I said previously, this is people who work hard vs. people who whine. And I'm going to fall on the side of the people who actually try to better themselves no matter what every time instead of people who whine to the wrong people, about the wrong problems, about decisions they personally made every time.

That's the way GOPers see the world. They ignore the mathematics involved. Working hard 20-30-40 years ago got you somewhere. Working hard now and getting nowhere is the new norm.

Things haven't changed that much. My brother just finishing working his way through a PhD in chemical engineering. At Vanderbilt. He has no student loans.

I worked my way through college a little over ten years ago at FSU. I have and had no student loans.

Also look at some of the other examples in the pics. Not all of them graduated 20+ years ago.

You can work hard at being a saddle maker, but I don't think you'll get very far. Gotta be a combination of both. But throwing up your hands and saying "just give me free stuff" is going to get my derision every time. I don't care what political party you are from.

Working hard by itself isn't going to get you anywhere. You gotta be smart about where you work and where you apply your energies.
 
 
 
 
 
stupidity, like virtue, is its own reward.

 

Must be why we hang out here.

Speaking of stupidity, why does Ropey have such a hard-on for you?  

 

i'm an antisemite.

didn't you get the memo?

 

No, because he trolled me...

And now he is deep in pretension....

Pretending he didn't do the things he did.

So he calls me names hoping it can be spun into that.

It can't.  
 
 
The more you feel entitled to things, the tougher your Life will be.
 
 
 
 
 
The government didn't allow this to happen. They actively created the environment for it to happen. Big difference. And of course those in government are trying to capitalize on it. Just look at Pelosi and others, who are part of the frigging problem, trying to "stand with the protestors". And the protestors lap it up. The ones who didn't are the ones who didn't allow John Lewis to speak. At least some of them recognized he is part of the problem too.

And the ones I posted were apolitical. So not sure how you got the idea they were GOP stooges. As I said previously, this is people who work hard vs. people who whine. And I'm going to fall on the side of the people who actually try to better themselves no matter what every time instead of people who whine to the wrong people, about the wrong problems, about decisions they personally made every time.

 

THAT is EXACTLY the attitude that makes me think they're GOP stooges. "There's no problem, the only problem is that YOU DON'T WORK HARD ENOUGH."

That's the way GOPers see the world. They ignore the mathematics involved. Working hard 20-30-40 years ago got you somewhere. Working hard now and getting nowhere is the new norm.

There's less labor available. The pool is flooded which has driven down wages. There's going to be a lot more losers.

The ironic thing is that if I was predisposed to conservative thinking, I could have written some of these. I did work my ass off, and I did make it.

Not an excuse to ignore the mathematics. And I don't see this 'brand' that is demanding 'free stuff.' Insofar as I can tell that's a meme. A few, maybe, but that's not the preponderance of the movement as I see it. I see folks who want an opportunity. Pointing out that winners still exist doesn't disprove, nor should it dismiss, that any way you slice it there are going to be more losers than there used to be.

He didn't ignore the 'math' (what you mentioned is more accurately arithmetic...just a pet peeve of mine, so no matter - just needed to say that). He said it's not just hard work that leads to success, it's both hard work and smart work.

So your math doesn't apply as it is both hard and smart work.

For example, I can work hard - 40-60 - hours a week folding paperclips, but I am going to be in the lower class doing unskilled labor and a labor that most persons CAN do. Thus, the supply for that wage keeps the wage down.

I have to work smart, too.

That applied in the 1940s and it applies now. So, little has changed - hard and smart work.

So train yourself in jobs that require less labor. Part of the work smarter thing.

If you don't see this brand that is demanding free stuff, I suggest you look a little harder at what some of the demands are of the protestors.
 
 
Both of you:

When I say labor, in this context I'm referring to JOBS.

There are LESS JOBS AVAILABLE. Less to go around, more losers. Even if everyone simultaneously starts working hard and smart, it will just raise the bar for everyone and there will be just as many losers; perhaps more as 'worker productivity' will go higher and flood the market more still.

You're not addressing that. You just keep repeating the same things over and over.

  Figuring out how to work smart is work in itself. If someone could just tell you, then it would be of little value (because everyone else knows it, too).

And there are less jobs because of the economic situation the politicians have put us into. So once again it's the politicians screwing over the country once again. Not Wall Street.

Cause the laws are different here than in NYC. Plus the widespread lack of support here for the protestors.

I don't see a whole lot of food, clothing and showers being donated.

Dude, again though, what the fuck are you talking about? Private industry did all these things out of allegiance to their shareholders and officers, and you give them a pass because they claim 'the government made us do it?'

Here's what I'll grant you, when company A does it, company B doesn't have much choice but to follow suite. A outsources his call center, so must B to remain competitive. A ups the anti by importing come cheap parts, so must B, and so on.

But 'The government made me do it?" That's ridiculous, and I'm a bit shocked that you're inclined to believe it.

I never said the government made them do it. Try again.

I said the government created the environment which made it more profitable for businesses to implement these practices. Such as outsourcing to use your example.

Quite a LARGE difference from "the government made them do it".

Do you see a pattern emerging here? The government doesn't "DO" any of these things. They only allow it to happen; They only fail to prevent it. And I think that's a big part of the message here - "STOP. LETTING. THIS. HAPPEN."

 

 
The protesters, at least as I understand and interpret the movement, are telling their elected officials to stop letting this happen.

 

 
And like any other movement, there are some clueless, some no doubt very bright, and a lot of everything in between.

But you agree that a.) the government didn't 'DO this,' but only 'ALLOWED it to happen,' and b.) The government needs to respond to the problem in a meaningful way. Correct?

 

yeah, sure I have...
