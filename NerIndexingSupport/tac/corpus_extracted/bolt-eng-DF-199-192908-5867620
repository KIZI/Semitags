It's back! The NFL's first game is just a month away and A2K will be here for our FOURTH SEASON!
That's right, ladies and gents, for three years folks here on A2K who don't know one end of a football from the other have been trying to pick the winners in each week's games.
The first year when we had all of 6 players, the winner (yes we do give a trophy out at the end of the year) was Realjohnboy in VA. Kickycan in NY won year #2 (12 players). Last year Chiso in TX eked out a win with there being about 18 active players.

There is no registration required and the scoring has been set up such that if you forget to play, you won't be penalized.

Let me know by posting here if you might be interested in participating.
-rjb-
 
 
I am two hundred and seven eighths sure I can make some good picks this year.
 
 
interested
 
 
The whole NFL is junior varsity, and the only club in the varsity league is the Patriots.
 
 
I'm in.

yeah uhuh
getting Moss is giving Pats fans a woodie
 
 
Mixing our sports metaphors here, recall how race horses are brought to the starting gate and wrestled in?
RJB slips into gate #1...just because, damn it.
Sublime responded next, so he gets gate #2. The rap on him is that he parties hard on Saturday and doesn't wake up until just before game time on Sunday.
JPB slides into gate #3. She may, just may, become a big influence here. We shall see.
Liontamerx confidently slips into slot #4.
Osso backs into #5 and then realizes that everyone else is pointed in the other direction. She discreetly corrects herself.
Panzade heads for position #6 but then wanders off as he has for each of the other seasons. It is unclear whether he will actually make it to the gate.
And Slappy? He will spout and sputter---kind of like Gus---but won't actually reduce himself to playing each week.
Who else can I praise or insult?
 
 
I'm in.

You should consider setting up something on Yahoo on their pick'em leagues. You can PM me if you need details, but the setup is slick and everything would be automated for you.
 
 
hah! I was just going to volunteer to coordinate picks, but now I nominate maporsche  
 
 
Sure, I'm in, prolly can't play each week.
 
 
Pls count me in.

I never saw this pick-'em contest earlier, but at least I did see it in time for the current season.

For the heck of it (unrelated to the main contest), a prediction:
Pats will win 12 and lose 4.
 
 
Maporsche slides into lot #7 and looks over the field. Easy pickings?

JPB comfortably gets into the #8 slot next to Jespah in #9. They warily eye Ragman in the #10 position. Who is he? Does he know anything about football?
 
 
Of course I'm in, not knowing my hind end from my nose. 'Tis invigorating, this view of the paddocks.... er, locker rooms.
 
 
Does Ragman know anything about football? Tell me true, does this make any kind of significant difference? Oh, sure, Chiso does ok...
 
 
My interest in football is not so intense these days. Still, I want to see how the Steelers and the Texans do. I'll play. I predict that the current superbowl champ will not repeat.
 
 
TY, Osso...much appreciated.

I mustn't know too much about football, as I picked my Pats to go all the way last year. LOL  

I'm hoping against hope that Asante Samuel doesn't hold out and plays the whole season.
 
 
Bedtime for Realjohnboy. And, my oh my, we are up to eleven slots filled with Edgar's joining. This could be awesome. I am clearing out the A2K NFL Headquarters and bringing in a new supply of Pabst Blue Ribbons, crackers and Cheese-wiz. And new desks.
 
 
I assume we are not doing pre season. I don't follow that.
 
 
 
Maporsche slides into lot #7 and looks over the field. Easy pickings?

JPB comfortably gets into the #8 slot next to Jespah in #9. They warily eye Ragman in the #10 position. Who is he? Does he know anything about football?
 

Hey! I thought I was #3. How quickly one gets demoted....  
 
 
The A2K Road to Phoenix. That got me excited for a minute, especially when I heard people yelling, "I'm in!"

But this is about football, isn't it? And not a fellow A2Ker.

Well, I'll still play. But it won't be as fun as originally thought.
 
 
Right, Edgar, we don't do pre-season.

Yaaaaay, Gus!
 
 
you can count on my 27 points again this year, RJB...
 
 
You are right, JPB. You are in slot #3. Gus, just downwind from Jespah, gets #8 and Region gets #12.
Who wants the #13 position?
I hava 23 columns set up and still to be heard from, amongst folks who played last year, are Chiso, JPinMilw, Child of Light. Pantalones, Tico, Fbaezer, Cowdoc, Cjhsa, Ms Cowdoc and George
Any new players are invited to come on in.

And yes, JPB, you are most welcome to take over any aspect of running this you want.
 
 
can i just watch for a while?

(i will take #13 but i may not post any picks until week 3)
 
 
 
And yes, JPB, you are most welcome to take over any aspect of running this you want.
 

I'll take over the schedules, tables and tallies, but I'm not too good at being a pest. Wait... maybe I am, but I'd rather someone else took on that portion.

Sweet! I can continue to do the nagging unless Osso wants that job. If so I can totally retire from being involved in running this.
 
 
I'll try doing the nagging. You nagged by pm, right? Was there a pattern to it? Last minute? day before the first game?

Also, we could use some rule elaboration... if you miss picking a game on thursday, can you still pick the rest of that week's games?
 
 
Most nagging was done by pm. Except for the folks in Chicago. I have a cousin in Chicago. Bruno. He would "visit" some folks, if needed.

Rules were made up by me as we went along. I recall letting folks come in a few minutes late but I also recall once decreeing that a player was too late. I can't remmber why I did that.
I leave all of that this year up to JPB, knowing that she will appreciate that this is a casual little amusement amongst us, and nothing to be taken too seriously.
 
 
I think it was because it was the first instance and you wanted to keep things semi-sane. Then gus challenged you to a duel on your porch and I was going to be the official spectator/judge, but my memory gets sort of murky after that...
 
 
Oh, yes. I remember now. Gus wanted a duel on the Lawn of UVA. Me in front of the Rotunda. Him twenty paces away to the south. I was there at 11:45 am, waiting for high noon. I waited and waited, finally ordering a pizza, and then going home at 1:30 after throwing a frisbee to a dog for half an hour.
 
 
I'm in.
 
 
Yaaaay...
 
 
I seem to do better in predicting football (which I mostly don't like) than baseball (which I enjoy) for some reason. So yeah, sign me up.
 
 
I'm in.

As long as I'm allowed to base my predictions on team colours and logos, and don't have to pretend I have a sporting clue.
 
 
Yayyyyy and Yayyyy!

ehBeth, last year, I watched Jespah and her advanced choice criteria with utter envy... such fun.
Pantalones, it seems when one cares too much, poor decision making prevails (kidding). This probably means I'd be better at selecting in baseball..
 
 
I think I may go with  bar stools  this season.
 
 
What? Not  shower curtains? 
 
 
Hey, thanks osso. I'll find some other criteria for this year. I have a fan! {shniff}
 
 
Not only that, you are a superbly funny writer (the a2k story thread). I know, I've said that before, but it's true, it's true.

<quiets down, tries to stop smiling>
 
 
Our list of interested players keeps rising, much like the temperatures in the midwest, east and south. We hit a 100 in Cville today.
Wandejw goes tentatively into gate #13. You are welcome to watch for awhile if you would like, but you could participate and do as well as many of the rest of us by randomly picking.
Tico struts into the 14th slot. Confident, probably, but he finished in 11th place last year.
Pantalones takes the next position (#15) and begins by saying (sandbagging) that he doesn't really follow American football. He finished 7th last year.
And in the #16 position is Ehbeth. Whatever criteria you use is as good as most anyone else's, ehbeth.
Six new players players over last year's regular season group. Awesome.
 
 
I'm in.
 
 
 
I'm in.
 

{{{{{{{{ jp }}}}}}}}}} Wow, good to see you. How ya been?
 
 
I'll give it a go. Not in fantasy league any longer - so this is it.
 
 
when is the football fantasy league starting up?

Cycloptichorn
 
 
I'm in for another season of wild-ass guessing,
er, that is, scientific prognostication.
 
 
Oh, and I'm in as well to the predictions.

Cycloptichorn
 
 
jpin, long time no see!
 
 
 
it seems when one cares too much, poor decision making prevails (kidding). This probably means I'd be better at selecting in baseball..
 

Even if you're kidding it's often true. Remember that last season most of us did better than at least one ESPN expert.
 
 
the usual suspects and some new

hi jpn
 
 
My, my. Another surge in players today! I wonder how that happened? Nagging, osso, is an art form.
Jpinmilw (who finished 4th last year) joins. "What a bunch of losers," he mutters as he maneuvers into slot #17. Just to his left in #18 is Cjhsa, who coincidentally finished last year in 18th place. Did I mention that we had 18 players last year? Cyclop occupies the 19th position and George jogs into the 20th gate.
I still haven't heard from the Cowdocs in Salmon, Idaho. But I expect to.
Chiso has yet to open the pm I sent to him yesterday. Where is Fbaezer? I thought he would be here by now. Child of Light seems to have gone missing and Kicky(Mr Reliable)can said he is thinking about it.

Anyone else in A2K land is welcome to join in!

Just kicking this up. This is a very low-key game where knowledge about the NFL (that's pro football) is not at all needed.
 
 
So, who is missing? Chiso, cowdoc, mrs. cowdoc, cjhsa....

Among the absent are those absent who have C's in their names - with the occasional K. This is ominous.

Also among the absent are those who don't know they like guessing about a game of which they have no clue.
 
 
cjhsa is in, osso, but CotL is MIA
 
 
I see I said 'among those absent' wayyyy too many times. Hmmm, what was I up to?

I thought I'd seen cjhsa, and then couldn't find him under my apparent influence.

Carry on, nurses.
 
 
Hey everyone... I've been good. Staying pretty busy with school and starting up a little side business to help pay for school... but I got a little break so I thought I'd drop in and say hello. Glad to see everyone still here.
 
 
Hey jp!
Good to see those dexterous digits again.
 
 
Good evening to everyone. I may be busy next week with my architect and the city people, so here goes, JPB, with the list of folks who have indicated an interest in playing this year. I have, alas, only abbreviations of some of the folk's screen names.
Realjohnboy (who finished tied for 11th of 18 last year); Sublime (3rd); JPB (15th); Liontamerx (6th); Panzade (14th); Osso (7th); Maporsh (*New this year); Gus (*New); Jespah (17th); Ragman (*New); Edgar (*New); Region (7th); Wandejw (*New); Tico (11th); Pantalones (7th); Ehbeth (*New)); Jpinmilw (4th); Cjhsa (18th); Cyclop (*New); George (16th); Cowdoc (2nd); and Ms Cowdoc (10th).
22 so far.
Start laying out the chart, JPB!
 
 
Mrs. Cowdoc is a sleeper. JPB is sharper than the finish number. Osso is duller than the finish number. Sublime is quiet but wise...
I suspect Gus is stupendously smart, but don't let him know.
 
 
 
I suspect Gus is stupendously smart.
 

That was funny, osso.
 
 
You think swamp guys can't be smart once they bathe?

22 so far.
Start laying out the chart, JPB!
 

Chart? You're talking to a statistician -- we've got ourselves a database, baby.
 
 
CowDoc -- does T have a login for her picks, or will they be under your account? If they will be under your account, does she want to be charted as Mrs CowDoc or would she prefer something else?
 
 
JPB: You may want to consider, perhaps, a slight rule change because of the increased number of players. In the past, in addition to picking the winner in each game, we would predict the TOTAL number of points scored in the Monday game. A couple of times this attempt came close to not working as a tie-breaker in determining a weekly winner.
So faced with Indy @ Tenn, as the Monday night game, someone might say: Indy (27).
I see that Yahoo (with thousands of players) has a multi-level tie-breaking system, all of which seem to involve picking the SCORE in that last game. So faced with Indy @ Tenn, folks might still say Indy, but followed by (14-13).
The tiebreaker would still use TOTAL points as the first determiner of the weekly winner but then you could move on to the person closest to the winning team's points or the person closest to the home team's points.
Whatever criteria you put in place would NOT dramatically affect what is expected of players, but would give you a defined path for ruling on who wins a particular week.
I am just tossing that out for whatever it is worth. I noticed it becoming an issue with 18 players. As we get up to 24 or whatever, it will become more of an issue.

Thanks for taking this over. It should be amusing. -realjohn(cheez-whiz and PBR is a balanced diet)boy.
 
 
Thanks, rjb. I'd actually forgotten to put the tie-breaker into the database. It's there now. Here's the yahoo list

 
1. Closest to the total points for Monday night's game.
2. Closest to the home team points for Monday night's game.
3. Closest to the road team points for Monday night's game.
4. Closest to the total points for Sunday night's game.
5. Closest to the home team points for Sunday night's game.
6. Closest to the road team points for Sunday night's game.
7. Closest to the city whose team scores the most points.
8. Closest to the city whose team scores the fewest points.
9. Whichever user had more points in the previous week (or the week before that if still tied, etc.).

 

We can use the same second level as their #1 or go straight to a modification of #9. Give the second level tie-breaker to the person behind in our standings heading into the current week. I'm not sure we'll need a second level, but I like giving a nod to someone struggling in the standings. Thoughts?
 
 
OR, we could go with a one over-time then tie type rule where we keep the total points as the first level tie-breaker and then have a tie for the weekly winner. I'll be able to track overall seasonal standings by games picked and weighted standings by within week standings.
 
 
I like the notion of the tie going to the lower ranking player. Kind of in the spirit of A2K. I doubt that most of us here care what criteria you use (one of the joys of running this is making up rules on the fly) as long as you have thought it out a bit in advance and there is no imposition on the players' time involved in participating. Whatever you decide is probably going to be fine with most of us.
 
 
I concur...
 
 
Here's rjb's rules post from last year. We might as well use it as the base.

 
The format of the schedule posting will look like this (at least this is how it might look if I do it; pan may have a different format if he does it):

Week #1:
9/7 (8:30 pm): Miami @ Pittsburgh
9/10 (early games): Seattle @ Detroit
Philadelphia @ Houston
and so on through
9/11 (10:00 pm): San Diego @ Oakland

I am hoping that Pan will throw in some pertinent commentary on the matchups to help folks make their selections. The maximum number of games to pick is 16; later on that drops to 14 or so as teams take turns getting a bye week.

So this is what the players here are expected to do. Publically post your selections of the winners of each game. I would prefer that that bedone succiinctly (makes recording picks a hell of lot easier):

"I am going with Pitt, Seattle, Houston etc"

When you get to the last game you must do one more thing. You need to predict the total number of points that the two teams will score in the game. We use that as the tiebreaker in the scoring (more about that in the next post). So you might say:

"and San Diego (27)." Again, the 27 is the total number of points scored by the two teams.

A couple of warnings: Please check your picks before hitting submit to be sure you selected in all of the games and have indicated the total number of points in the final game of the week.
And please remember that the deadline is one minute before the kickoff of the first game of the weekend. We have made a few exceptions in the past if someone was a bit tardy, but they will be very, very rare in the future as we get more players. All times listed are ET.

 
 
 
Damn, I sounded like Sister Linus, my 1st grade teacher!
 
 
Looks like a busy year... but, I'll play.

Eked? I thought it was 'coasted'.
 
 
Hi, Chiso!
(Chiso won last year. How are you displaying the Golden Jockstrap trophy we sent? Awesome, isn't it?)

23, jpb.
 
 
yep, got it. Glad to see you, chiso.
 
 
Count us in! The wife says Mrs Cowdoc is fine with her. I have to be in Washington the 6th and 7th, but I should be able to get my picks for the first week in before I leave.
 
 
 
So faced with Indy @ Tenn, as the Monday night game, someone might say: Indy (27).
 

someone might... someone might indeed...

An inside joke that soared by most everyone else.
 
 
I got it.  
 
 
JPB (or anyone else): I was amused to hear that C.I. had an interest in the NFL. He joined the Fantasy Football thing that JPinMilw has set up. I contacted him about playing in our game also and he asked for a link to get here. I am a computer idiot and my computer is acting up. Please try to reel him in as player #24.
 
 
Okay, rjb, found you! I'm in, but will be absent in October and November for a total of about five weeks total.
 
 
And I got a pm from Fbaezer saying that he will be playing. He slips into gate #25.
 
 
Very good then.
 
 
So I was sort of half-listening this evening to an NPR program called Marketplace. All about the day's news in business. Another bad day for stocks etc.
The last story was about the cost of forest fires to the tourism industry. Specifically about wilderness tours via kayak or whatever. They talked to a lady named Aileen Steen of Yellow Jacket River Guides in Salmon, Idaho. She spoke about a nearby fire that is wiping out her schedule of outings.
SALMON, IDAHO! We on A2K know folks from there. The Cowdocs. Terri and Cope.
Any update yall can report from there would be appreciated.
 
 
The list of players:

 
CowDoc
Cycloptichorn
Fbaezer
George
JPB
LionTamerX
Mrs CowDoc
Pantalones
Ragman
Realjohnboy
Region Philbis
Sublime1

-rjb-
 

I am kicking this up again after a week. JPB, who will be running this thing once the season gets started, has 25 players in her database. But we can certainly handle more. If you might find participating in this decidedly low-key game amusing, please let us know. Knowledge of or interest in NFL is not required. Not required at all.
And it takes about 5 minutes a week to play!
 
 
Lack of knowledge can be useful (see espn/sports illustrated predictors..), though I'll admit some of those at the top apparently know what they're doing, or did, last year....
 
 
The regular season begins two weeks from today! I'll post the lineups next week and we'll look to close out the picks for week one by 5 mins before the opening kickoff of the first game on Thursday night (New Orleans at Indianapolis).

Who's got the wings and beer?
 
 
The Bears beat Indianapolis in their preseason game (as everyone probably knows).

Will you be picking New Orleans over Indianapolis, JPB?
 
 
 
Who's got the wings and beer?
 

i'll bring the wings

 
 
 
The 9ers beat the Raiders - in the last few minutes of the game. It was a pretty good game to watch.
 
 
 
The Bears beat Indianapolis in their preseason game (as everyone probably knows).

Will you be picking New Orleans over Indianapolis, JPB?
 

Probably, loyalty over intelligence, and all that. That would also send me to the bottom half of the standings right out of the gate. I'd feel right at home.

er... rp? I was thinking of the other kind of wings. Those look to be a bit harsh on the teeth and gums.
 
 
checking in

wings
check

beer
check

clue

err, not so much

enthusiasm
check!
 
 
With that kind of wing, he'll need a prayer too!
 
 
Are we ready for some?!?!

 

Gather one, gather all! Bring your scouting reports, deep knowledge of the game, inside info from your friends, or... your coin to flip, your gut to listen to, or whatever else might float your boat in making your picks. Here we go! The first game is one week from today. Indicate your choice for each game and the overall combined score for both teams for the Monday night game as the tie-breaker.

Osso will get her chain-rattlers ready to nudge the slow-pokes, but make your choices early -- you can always change them up until the first kick-off of the first game.

WEEK 1
Thursday, Sep 6
New Orleans at Indianapolis

Sunday, Sep. 9
Atlanta at Minnesota
Carolina at St. Louis
Denver at Buffalo
Kansas City at Houston
Miami at Washington

Chicago at San Diego
Detroit at Oakland
Tampa Bay at Seattle
N.Y. Giants at Dallas

Monday, Sep. 10
Baltimore at Cincinnati
Arizona at San Francisco
 
 
The 9ers at the tail end for the start-off, just like they play football!
 
 
I think we'll need some wings and beer just to start cogitating on our team selections...

Some chinese chicken wings with bean sauce -
 

Some Thai chicken wings -
 

Enjoy..

Some Red Tail Ale
 

Some Tsingtao Beer -
 
 
 
osso, I'm not sure you are aware of it, but the beer and buffalo wings go together quite well. The second china looks Chinese - as is the beer.  
 
 
Yeh, I did that on purpose, CI. I like chinese chicken wings (they're not all sweet) and chinese beer myself.

You can provide the buffalo wings...
 
 
okay, but I'm not sure about that brand of beer.
 
 
 
[Indicate your choice for each game and the overall combined score for both teams for the Monday night game as the tie-breaker.

Monday, Sep. 10
Baltimore at Cincinnati
Arizona at San Francisco
 

ah, crap. There are two Monday night games. Let pick the overall score for the AZ - SF game for the tie-breaker.
 
 
All right! (That's a game of interest to me...)
 
 
I've made my picks, but I ain't going first!

I think I recall hearing that, early on in the season, the defense comes together faster than the offense. With players jumping from team to team, it can take a few weeks after training for an offense to click. The result can be sloppy games with low scores.

The most interesting game next week could be San Diego vs Chicago; Two teams that have a legitimate chance this season.

Perhaps someone who actually knows something about the NFL could comment.
 
 
I haven't started making picks, being busy driving the Stoatmobile for a bit.

I guess it's no fair to say "what he says" about Chiso....
 
 
Screw it, I'm going first...

Indianapolis
Minnesota
Carolina
Buffalo
Houston
Washington
N.Y. Jets
Green Bay
Cleveland
Jacksonville
San Diego
Oakland
Seattle
Dallas
Cincinnati
San Francisco

as always... pick San Diego and don't pick Oakland  
 
 
total points in the SF-AZ game?
 
 
beat me before I edited  

Is it overall score? someone mentioned to pick the score for both teams, right?

I'll say 21-17

Ha. That wasn't so bad, was it? Do any of yall recall going to some of your first dances as 13 year olds, or whatever. All of the boys would cluster on one side of the room and try to look cool. The girls would be on the other side, trying to look like they were having a great time chatting to each other, ignoring the boys. And the 45 rpm records kept playing until finally one of the boys would muster the nerve to cross the divide and ask a girl to dance with him.

I am going with:
Indy (could be my 1st miscue-NO may be a pretty decent team)
Atlanta (the Falcons want to get the Vick thing behind them)
Carolina (Up and down Panthers could be decent)
Denver
Kansas City
Miami
New England (the favorite in most "experts" minds this year)
Philadelphia
Pittsburgh

woo hoo! picks! we've got picks!

I'm easily amused....
 
 
Is it too late? Who does one have to sleep with to participate in this game? (Please say Osso)
 
 
I'm easily confused..

Clarifications -

deadline for selection is still 5 minutes before first game kickoff, right?
For example, this next Thursday kickoff is supposed to be 8:30 pm, ET. So that means 8:25, natch. Not one minute before, or one second before kickoff.. (Just refining my potential for nagging Late People)

then, there was the possibility of needing the tie breaker information of the actual score of that Monday night game, but that wasn't in the instructions -
do we care or didn't that get resolved that if there was a tie, whoever was lowest ranking up until then wins the tiebreaker??
 
 
I don't think you're too late.. but JPB is running this Shindig.

Hugs Imur...
 
 
The Amazing Giorgio will now consult his pointy-ended crystal ball...

Hi, lumr, and welcome! JPB, who runs this, had to step out for a bit, but she will be back. She will, I am sure, re-post the schedule and the rules this weekend.
We look forward to having you play!
 
 
Uh oh, I think I've been misreading your posting name. Lmur?
 
 
It could be Imur, osso. Even with glasses, I's look like l's.
 
 
I bet it's an L (l), but I'll have to get used to it...
 
 
Week 1 picks
Hugs to you Osso. And many thanks for the welcome, realjohnboy.

I hadn't noticed the misspelling; (small ell)mur is what's on my a2k passport. Nothing to worry about.

I've now read the complete thread and think I understand the format, if not the actual game. (American Football is substantially different from baseball, no?). On the assumption that JPB's database is not overloaded, these are my Week 1 choices:

Indianapolis
Minnesota
Carolina
Denver
Kansas City
Washington
New England
Green Bay
Pittsburgh
Jacksonville
Chicago
Oakland
Seattle
N.Y. Giants
Baltimore
San Francisco (35-17= 52 )
 
 
 
I'm easily confused..

Right!

 
then, there was the possibility of needing the tie breaker information of the actual score of that Monday night game, but that wasn't in the instructions -
do we care or didn't that get resolved that if there was a tie, whoever was lowest ranking up until then wins the tiebreaker??
 

That was a second level tiebreaker. If we have a tie after the total score tiebreaker, then the one with the lower standings in our game leading into the current week will get that week's win. Last year there were a couple games where 2 or 3 players would be tied at the end of Sunday's games and have the same winner(s) picked for Monday night. rjb would give those folks an opportunity to change their total score for the Monday night game. We decided to forgo that this year and give the weekly win to the person behind in our game. So yes, we do need the total score of the designated Monday night game (one game will be designated if there are two Monday night games).

In addition to the overall standings based on games picked correctly, I've got a number of stats that I'm planning on providing. Weekly standings as a composite tally is one (1 pt for first place, 2 for second, etc., lowest overall score at the end of the regular season wins that metric).

lmur -- welcome, welcome! There's plenty of room in my database. I need all the folks I can get to potentially do worse than myself.
 
 
 
Oh, what the hell... I ain't skeert.

JPB,

Until you yourself picked Chicago, I felt I was in lone wolf territory. I kept asking, "Where the hell is sublime?"  
 
 
I'm just going to watch this year. And root for Osso.

Maybe I'll make some picks. If I feel like it. Maybe.

Duly noted, Kickycan. You are on the Do Not Nag List (at least mine).
 
 
........ and let's not forget to say that JPB has been extraordinarily patient!
 
 
Thanks, ci.

Great to see you here, kicky.

With 18 players posting (excluding CowDoc for the moment), the top choices are:

NY Jets 2 - Pantelones and fbaezer
Houston 3 - Pantelones, cicerone imposter, kickycan

Keep 'em coming!
 
 
And both osso and JPB have been very helpful to this old geezer. They're gonna thank me when I go on vacation next month and November. he he he...

[Indicate your choice for each game and the overall combined score for both teams for the Monday night game as the tie-breaker.

Monday, Sep. 10

ah, crap. There are two Monday night games. Let pick the overall score for the AZ - SF game for the tie-breaker.
 

Aaack! it's the AZ-SF game, JPB, that's what we've all been doing and what I've pm'd people.

RJB, I pm'd a batch yesterday, most of that batch have picked up the pms, and I'll do the rest in a few minutes, well, I'll space them, but I'll start in a few minutes.

Waves to Kicky.... good man, hard to hold down.

In case you don't see it, JPB, CI did give a total for AZ SF, but it's back on a post by itself.
 
 
 
Thanks, ci.

ehbeth - total score of Monday's game

 

ptooey

I'll be back once the pig tails are roasted.
 
 
I have three left to nag, will do that in a bit.

Of the first nagging batch, Gustav and Sublime haven't picked up the pms yet. I somehow double nagged Gus... my name will be mud, I'm sure.

(if someone hasn't picked up a pm, you can delete/retract it)
 
 
Thanks, ehBeth, I'd never noticed that Delete Message button in the bottom corner before. (How many years, how many posts...)
 
 
Ok, the naggies are nagged. Thassit.
 
 
OK..I'm working on it. Looking at depth charts, injury reports, etc. Then in order to make my choices I'm going to flip my coin 'cause it's only the first week. I should be ready tonight.
 
 
Aha, the science guy in the group....

are you ready for some football?

 
 
 
Region: great graphics display.

Everyone: Here's a potential brainteaser regarding that image:

Was the football thrown by a right or lefty (assume you are not looking at reversed through mirror or vid-camera)?
 
 
Lefty, of course. If it was a righty, the ball would be spinning clockwise.

Cycloptichorn
 
 
Well done..quite correct, but... as it's shown here the ball IS spinning clockwise as it's coming toward us.

Did you mean counter-clockwise if it was thrown by a righty?
 
 
You are messing with our heads, Professor Ragman, up there in Albany. A pass from a right-handed QB would be spinning clockwise in his eyes, The receiver, if he was facing the QB, would see it coming as counter-clockwise.
I think.
 
 
Hmmm. I agree a righty throws clockwise from his eyes, but I've rarely thrown a football. Once in a while, though. Well, whatever, great graphic.
 
 
correct..it depends on whether receiving or throwing....viewing perspective. Maybe I muddied that?
 
 
I'd have to go back and review it. Time out!!
 
 
 
Well done..quite correct, but... as it's shown here the ball IS spinning clockwise as it's coming toward us.

Did you mean counter-clockwise if it was thrown by a righty?
 

Well, I was looking at it from the thrower's perspective. Good little riddle, though - the flame trail is the giveaway, denoting direction.

Cycloptichorn
 
 
Yes, that was part of the observation...the indication of a direction (vector)
 
 
I failed physics in high school. So I know nothing. But I was good in writing and economics.

Are yall ready for some football?
 
 
You betcha!
 
 
I nearly failed physics in university (put it off until I was a senior senior), hadn't taken it in high school. Damned girls' school. I was one of only two in a class of, say, 250, that hadn't had physics in high school. The other poor soul probably dropped it. I knew I was in trouble when the prof started in about vectors, whazzat?

Well, hey, sometimes I'm poetic about things like flights of footballs.

Game time...

Look up your own, and a note from JPB a few pages back - you screwed up on two games, naming both teams.....
 
 
Realjohnboy congratulates JPB for getting this season off to a fine start (along with her trusty sidekick, Osso). Something like 23 players, which is a record, beating anything in any previous year.
Trust me, JPB, the fun part starts after the picks have been made and the games actually begin.
 
 
I tried to edit and RJB and I cross posted - will repost it here:

COWDOC!!

Look up your own, and a note from JPB a few pages back - you screwed up on two games, naming both teams..... or something like that.

I'm sorry I didn't PM you about it, I thought you were gone, eek!
 
 
Here's my list, don't know what number it comes to, and besides that, it's only correct until JPB looks at it. Asterisk means posted selection.

Will have to find a better word for nagged. Irritated? Nuzzled? Nudged?
Memo'd? (bletch)
 
 
First touchdown of the new season! Manning to Marvin Harrison in the back of the end zone! Let the season begin, baby!
 
 
I'm starting to figure out that it was Mrs. Cowdoc who just posted...

Puts paws together and nods.

Gone to check with ESPN/whatever and break down some boxes for tomorrow's trash..
 
 
OssoB, I consider you an encourager, or if you wanna go New Age Sensitive Guy - you're a facilitator.

Or, Old Skool Nudgnik!  
 
 
Facilitator, lord love a duck. I was an 'official' one of those once, nearly died of community multiple obnoxiousness. Survived, got the yellers to listen/talk for 12 weeks. Be still my beating heart. I avoid all that since.

Nudge, um, notice, note, are better than nag though.
 
 
 
First touchdown of the new season! Manning to Marvin Harrison in the back of the end zone! Let the season begin, baby!
 

My cable tv connection got zapped a month or so ago, back when we got rain, and I never bothered to call to get it fixed. I have Manning in the Fantasy league. Go, Manning.
 
 
Thanks, Mrs. Cowdoc, sorry to not catch on right away.

The people at the top made great picks. Osso has been far too modest. I am starting to make my picks for Week 2. It will be fun to see who wins Week 1.
 
 
Only those in the 10 and 11 group has a chance to win the first week. Good luck, you all!
 
 
osso is the only one in the 10 group with a chance, ci. The others have the same picks as either CowDoc or Ragman and can't catch them. Osso needs to cheer loudly for Baltimore -- it's her only chance of catching either of them.
 
 
Stupid Houston!!!

Also, why did I pick Atlanta? That was absolutely non intelligent.

Cycloptichorn
 
 
i did too -- figuring they'd rally around their new QB...
 
 
 
Stupid Houston!!!

Also, why did I pick Atlanta? That was absolutely non intelligent.

Cycloptichorn
 

You picked Atlanta like I did, because they looked better on paper - that you can later burn.
 
 
Let's see how well my super-complex method of 'picking from gut impulse' works out next week...

Cycloptichorn
 
 
Stupid Houston!

Trying to remember why on earth I picked Baltimore... Probably something re Cinci and last year. I had this habit of reading some sports news quickly/superficially, then picking a team on impulse, having it lose, choosing against it the next week, and having it win, and maybe reversing again the next week, with reversing results. Stupid football teams!

I'm glad this worked out this way. It gives me a cushion for total flubup on week 2, a pattern that has happened before.

The first week is actually somewhat easier then later weeks, to me - the teams which reliably have their act together from year to year outperform those who don't, but are prone to getting lucky from time to time.

During weeks 4-8 it will be tough for anyone to match the level of picks we see in the first two weeks, I wot, as offenses get their act together a little more.

Cycloptichorn
 
 
I should be kicking meeself for picking Oakland, why did I do that? I hadn't realized that until I checked my picks to see how I was doing. I even stated on the same post in which I wrote my picks that my strategy was to never pick Oakland, damn Raiders.
 
 
The Amazing Giorgio is tuning up his pointy-ended crystal ball. Just a
few blemishes to remove and then it will be ready for a dazzling round of
prognostications. Prepare to be astounded.
 
 
 
Two games left, three players still in the hunt for Week 1 champion honors --

CowDoc 11 Cinci and AZ(38)
Ragman 11 Cinci and SF(43)

ossobuco 10 Balt and SF(37) - can pull past CowDoc and tie Ragman
 

Cincinnati won the first game. It comes down to the final game and either CowDoc or Ragman will win week 1 outright with 13 wins. Well done to all of our three finalists.
 
 
Cincinnati won? Oh, well, good luck to them.

Snuffles, orders quintuple order of pan fried dumplings for those awake now....
 
 
Whoa...nice games! I'd like to duplicate this type of success again..really soon. Well, the middle of the season games #3 - #10 are often a lot harder to predict.

My, my, what an eager bunch some of yall are, posting even before JPB listed the schedule in some cases! I will have to ponder a bit.
By the way, I note that two of "experts" on ESPN got 12 right, while another one of them, like JPB, got 6 right.

I'm leaning towards NE. I think I am. I play in the A2K Fantasy League. There are some of the folks from here there. Quite a bit more involved than this thing. We have individual players on offense but then we put up one team to represent us on Defense. I have San Diego, but I put them on the Bench this week against NE NE looks strong. Could be a high scoring game.
 
 
NE will probably win, but SD is one of my emotional what the hell picks.

This week's kinda sorta foolproof method is to select the team in the city farthest to the East. At least, according to my mind. If I actually get the geography wrong, well, it's the thought, twisted as it is, that counts.

Buffalo (0-1) at Pittsburgh (1-0) Buffalo
Houston (1-0) at Carolina (1-0) Carolina
Atlanta (0-1) at Jacksonville (0-1) Atlanta
New Orleans (0-1) at Tampa Bay (0-1) Tampa Bay
Green Bay (1-0) at NY Giants (0-1) NY Giants
San Francisco (1-0) at St. Louis (0-1) St. Louis
Cincinnati (1-0) at Cleveland (0-1) I have no idea which one is further East and am too lazy to look it up so I'm going with Cincy
Indianapolis (1-0) at Tennessee (1-0) Tennessee
Minnesota (1-0) at Detroit (1-0) Detroit
Dallas (1-0) at Miami (0-1) Miami
Seattle (1-0) at Arizona (0-1) Arizona
NY Jets (0-1) at Baltimore (0-1) close to call geographically so I'm flipping a mental coin and going with Baltimore
Oakland (0-1) at Denver (1-0) Denver
Kansas City (0-1) at Chicago (0-1) Chicago
San Diego (1-0) at New England (1-0) New England

Washington (1-0) at Philadelphia (0-1) another close one geographically so this time I'm going with the visiting team, Washington

34 points

Thank you to the record-keeping/nudging team.
 
 
Cleveland is east of Cincy, Jespah, but you are probably wise to let sleeping cities lie.
 
 
hmmm, that whole 'favourite accent' thing didn't work out quite as planned

I'm going to actually have to read a bit more.
 
 
I thought you did quite well with the accent bit, ehBeth. As the weeks go by, 9 is not a bad number.

Ragman is now in and the Cowdocs will be in once they finish working for the week. Panzade typically waits until he gets the final advice from his bookie in Vegas. Kickycan (who actually started this game 4 years ago) has asked not to be nagged. The others are fair game. Where is Mike Sublime?
 
 
I'll write pm reminders tomorrow, nods to JPB/RJB, probably in the morning my time in case anyone doesn't use a computer on the weekends at home.

I'm not inclined myself to do that past two weeks for those who don't respond - but we can figure that out next week.
 
 
I'm not done working for the week, but here goes anyway---

Pittsburgh
Indianapolis
Green Bay
Carolina
St. Louis
Cincinnati
New Orleans
Jacksonville
Dallas
Detroit
Seattle
Chicago
Baltimore
Denver
San Diego

Philadelphia (41)

Hopefully, the Mrs. will get her picks up soon.
 
 
 
Cyclo and George have identical picks. The only difference is the tie-breaker. However they end up in the end, they'll be there together.
 

This was incorrect. Cyclo and George differ on the Philly - Washington game. Ragman and fbaezer do have the same picks throughout and differ only on the tiebreaker.
 
 
thanks for letting us know. Wow, it was uncanny.

Just curious, but is this just interesting to know facts or does it help us in any way? As for example, fbaezer and I aren't that close in points, I don't think.
 
 
It's just chatter, Ragman. If the two of you do well this week, you may be going head-to-head on Monday night for this week's win. What's uncanny is the similarities of most of the picks. There are a number of games where there is only one lone wolf and a number of match-ups where two or more people differ only by a single game. The same is true for the ESPN 'Experts'. Most of the games are consensus picks with an occasional outlier. The one exception is the Minnesota-Detroit game  Experts .

Compare our breakouts with 19 players reporting -- we have a bit more noise around the consensus picks, but there are many players with the same 12 picks and then all differ from each other by only one game. The other point of interest is the popularity of the use of 35 as the tie-breaker. Five of the 18 tiebreakers posted are 35, three others picked 41 (YO, RP -- I need your tie-breaker!). Given the number of players with the potential of being tied this week and the number of players with the same tie-breakers, we could end up in a many-way tie.

Buffalo (1) at Pittsburgh (18) - jespah
Houston (3) at Carolina (16)
Atlanta (4) at Jacksonville (15)
New Orleans (16) at Tampa Bay (3)
Green Bay (14) at NY Giants (5)
San Francisco (12) at St. Louis (7)
Cincinnati (16) at Cleveland (3)
Indianapolis (16) at Tennessee (3)
Minnesota (9) at Detroit (10)
Dallas (15) at Miami (4)
Seattle (18) at Arizona (1) - jespah
NY Jets (1) at Baltimore (18) - LTX
Oakland (1) at Denver (18) - ci
Kansas City (0) at Chicago (19) This could be the upset of the year!
San Diego (6) at New England (13)

Washington (12) at Philadelphia (7)

It was almost the same, but I'm still ticked off at Philly for last week.
 
 
JPB went easy on cyclo-george and ragman-fbaezer. If this sort of thing happens again, there should be penalties.

They're just using the same resource for their picks. I'm more independent - and bound to choose more losers, because sentiment is somewhat more important. LOL

Same resource... our guts? I didn't do a single bit of research.

I suppose that after a lifetime of watching pro ball, I have a pretty good idea about which teams have which strengths. As I said earlier in the thread, the first few weeks are easier to predict then the middle of the season; the coaching staffs who have it together (Here's looking at you, Bellicheck!) generally do a better job in the first few weeks, when the team still doesn't have their act completely together. I'd be surprised if anyone is picking 11+ correctly in weeks 5-9.

As I've confessed earlier, I've not watched football at all the past year, and very little of it in previous years prior to Steve Young days, so I have to look at the "experts" who pick the winners and losers. For the past two weeks, my picks didn't resemble any of the "resrouces" I've used - intentionally, because I want to "play" the game. The first week picks weren't too bad, considering I used "gut" feelings.
 
 
This is almost too funny to contemplate as being real.

Simpson named suspect in casino break-in

By KATHLEEN HENNESSEY, Associated Press Writer
6 minutes ago

LAS VEGAS - Investigators questioned O.J. Simpson and named him a suspect Friday in a break-in at a casino hotel room involving sports memorabilia.

*** He claimed it was his.
 
 
Reminders sent... (except for Panz, Kicky, and Mrs. Cowdoc)
 
 
i'll post elevenish...as usual
 
 
 
The first week is actually somewhat easier then later weeks, to me - the teams which reliably have their act together from year to year outperform those who don't, but are prone to getting lucky from time to time.

During weeks 4-8 it will be tough for anyone to match the level of picks we see in the first two weeks.

Cycloptichorn
 

Cyclop: I thought I agreed with you but I went back to last year, and it may turn out to not be true. The winner in most all of the weeks had 11 or 12 correct picks. The exceptions were weeks #2 (14 correct picks), #5 (13 correct picks), #7 and #8 (9 correct picks) and #12 (13 correct picks).

(I made a couple of adjustments to account for weeks where there were only 14 games vs 16. And if someone ran away with a week, I averaged in the 2nd place finisher. Very unscientific).
 
 
rjb, With your record, you should make some bets in Vegas. Double up each time you bet, and collect every time you double your money - then go back to your starting bet. A sure money maker - if you know how the scores will end up.
 
 
I didn't keep track of how I did last year, but my memory is that it varied. I just checked over about five weeks in the middle, and, yep, it varied - I even got 11 once. (ahem, and 6 once.)
 
 
Point noted, Osso. I probably should have looked not at the winner of the week but how we did as a group. But I do not recall any real slump.
 
 
Well, from that quick glance, we all did fairly poorly in week six and seven (or was it seven and eight? - I think 6 was the worst of the five I just looked at.) I'm not sure that was a slump though - sometimes choices are fairly obvious, and sometimes there are more that are hard to decide, no matter how much you research.
 
 
 
rjb, With your record, you should make some bets in Vegas.
 

I don't know what you mean, ci. Last year I finished in something like 12th place out of the 17 or so players here.
Re Vegas, I have never been there. But I am back to working on a 30-day 'round the country Amtrak trip, now envisaged for April/May 2008. Did you know that Vegas doesn't have passenger rail service?
 
 
We wantcha to come here, RJ...

I have two different friends who took amtrak from LA to here not all so long ago. One says it is fabulous (roomette, good food, observation car w/ guide, etc) and the other says, no, that special stuff is on the LA - El Paso ride... Both are insistent.

(Er, excuse me, folks.)
 
 
Osso, I will bump that thread back up from the cobwebs.
Meanwhile, any comments from the Boston folks on the New England "cheating" story?

rjb, Amtrack does come to the San Francisco Bay Area, so I'll be expecting to see you when you're in the area. T.

Vegas does have a cute airport, though.
 
 
 
JPB went easy on cyclo-george and ragman-fbaezer. If this sort of thing happens again, there should be penalties.  
 

It's not my fault that ragman is so goddam smart!
 
 
Yeah...I peeked over the monitor and fbaezer's picks. BTW, put on a shirt, fercrissakes.

 
They're just using the same resource for their picks. I'm more independent - and bound to choose more losers, because sentiment is somewhat more important. LOL
 

Yes, I admit it...my resource is a crystal ball.

Also, I've watched football and a few other sports since about 1965..sort of got an idea which teams are serious and which aren't...which have talent and and which don't.

Re NE Pats and that video: In various degrees..this has been going on for decades. I've hear dome athletes to have admitted to such. Most teams have done it at one time or another (often using binoculars). Bellicheck just got caught at it..and he's THE most visible at present as he is at the helm of the franchise who is doing so well for the last 5 yrs or so.

Stupidest thing is that he didn't need to do it -- as his team was handing NY Jets' ass back to them.
 
 
I knew you guys were using something, but wouldn't have guessed a "crystal ball" in a million years! LOL

MIZ COWDOC (TERRIE)
 
 
By Darren Walton Fox Sports
September 09, 2007

Australian Saverio Rocca is tipping younger brother Anthony to follow him into the NFL as more and more Australians pursue a career in big-time American football.

While Anthony Rocca was busy leading Collingwood to a 38-point AFL Australian footbal league) finals win over Sydney on Saturday night, Sav was preparing to make his keenly awaited NFL debut for Philadelphia Eagles against Green Bay Packers tomorrow (3am Monday AEST).

Having secured a three-year punting contract with the Eagles, Rocca is among three Australians in the NFL ranks this season, joining former Geelong captain Ben Graham (New York Jets) and Dallas Cowboys Pro Bowl punter Mat McBriar.

The ex-Australian football star will also become only the sixth Australian to play in the NFL after Colin Scotts, Colin Ridgway, Darren Bennett, McBriar and Graham.

The trailblazing Scotts, a defensive tackle for the St Louis Cardinals in 1987, is the only Australian to play a position other than punter.

Ooooh, I might be jealous. But will I change...

cluck, cluck, probably not, though there is always tomorrow morning.
 
 
I'm excited about the game with NE Pats and Sandy Ago. Should be a lot of fun with tons of drama. I think it's an 8:15 PM ET start.

I generally followed Ms CowDock...with a few tweaks here and there
 
 
BOY ARE YOU IN TROUBLE!! I DON'T KNOW A THING ABOUT FOOTBALL OR MUCH OF ANYTHING ELSE. I WILL NEVER PICK SEATLE - BUT WILL MOST OFTEN PICK (OAKLAND) RAIDERS, 49ER'S, VIKINGS & STEELERS BECAUSE THESE WERE THE ONES I LIKE IN THE 60-70'S. (WHEN I WAS JUST A BABY)

MS COWDOC
 
 
I'm a sucker for gals who pick winners by the color motifs of the jerseys  
 
 
I suffering the half time blues, with 2 of 8 ok.... oops, that's 3.
 
 
I'm back and ready to watch some football. Good thing 'cuz the early games are almost half over. I just spent a glorious two days listening to the blues in Iowa and Wisconsin. The Chicago-landers will be singing the blues if the Bears lose today.

I've added panzade's and Miz Doc's picks to the board and we know have 21 players for the week with the following pick totals.

Buffalo (1) at Pittsburgh (20) - jespah
Houston (3) at Carolina (18)
Atlanta (4) at Jacksonville (17)
New Orleans (18) at Tampa Bay (3)
Green Bay (16) at NY Giants (5)

Dallas (17) at Miami (4)
Seattle (18) at Arizona (3)
NY Jets (1) at Baltimore (20) - LTX
Oakland (2) at Denver (19) - ci is joined by Miz Doc
Kansas City (0) at Chicago (21) rjb, have we had a unanimous regular season pick before?
San Diego (7) at New England (14)

Washington (13) at Philadelphia (8)

I don't see too many shocks in the first half of the early games, but the Saints better start figuring out what a football looks like. I don't know what game they're playing but it's not football.
 
 
I didn't tune in the Texans early. By gosh, they don't need my help, so far.
 
 
Oakland (2) at Denver (19) - ci is joined by Miz Doc

Foolish woman. LOL
 
 
Wow! 96 points scored in Ohio and there's still more than three minutes to play.
 
 
On the whole, a pretty offensive day. NO Saints...hmmm? Are they the same guys as last year?

I should have listened to my own murmurs about Tampa Bay and Tennessee. Well, Indy still won, but close, close. 'Course, if I'd listened, they would have cancelled each other out.

Now then, damn that HOUSTON.
 
 
Wow! Arizona beat Seattle. There you go, panzade. You get one back!
 
 
Those damn Raider's coach gave away the game.

I was robbed - by the coach!
 
 
YAAAY!

 

My thanks to the mural artist who painted the donkey and to my mom for providing the pin.
 
 
Narf, I rule! I'm givin' you all a false sense of security. Then I'll make my move. To where, I have no idea.

1 point! W00p!
 
 
Nah, jes, that was just the early games. You did much better the rest of the day. Here are the standings heading into tonight. lmur, of course, is already out of reach but there's plenty of fighting left to be done for second place.

George, Ragman, ci, and fbaezer concur with ehbeth's pick of Washington in tonight's game and cannot catch her for second place. Cyclo, RP, panzade, and rjb have each picked Philadelphia and can pull into a tie for second with an Eagles win tonight.
 
 
I am going to have to seriously rethink my picks for Houston in the future... their defense is playing great.

And who could have guessed that Cleveland would hang 50+ on Cinci?

Week 2 final rankings, games won and (season to date win rate plus overall ranking for those playing both weeks) --

Our two weekly winners, Ragman and lmur, are tied for first place overall and none of us are worse the 0.500 after two weeks.

Something else that may be interesting to track as the season progresses is the week-to-week place averages and (deviations). This is an indication of the average weekly ranking and consistency across weeks.

After two weeks we have Ragman with the best average place standing; Miz Doc, jes, Tico, Ragman, Cyclo, osso, and edgar with consistent place finishes; fbaezer, Pantalones, and JPB are flying all over the place; and chiso and kicky didn't play this week.

PS Tico, didja mean to write down baseball team names?
 
 
I think Tico is trying to test my knowledge of sports. S'ok, I've got baseball covered. I'm hosed if he switches to soccer teams.
 
 
I'm taking the team logos with me to an out-of-office meeting. There's going to be a fair bit of hang-time while the lawyers posture. I'll work on my strategy then.

(one of my colleagues has suggested t.v. characters)

The Texans have beaten the Colts before, but Andre Johnson will sit this one out. That's my main reason for choosing the Colts this week.
 
 
Mine too.

Let's see how picking while angry works out.
 

<ducks out of harms way...>

So far in week 3 --

We have 15 players posting picks. There is one unanimous choice (Denver over Jacksonville) and New England would have been unanimous if they were west of Buffalo. The closest games we have are San Diego (6) at Green Bay (9) and Cincinnati (6) at Seattle (9). Lots of noise around the rest of the games but most of us (13) are picking Detroit, Pittsburgh, and Washington over Philadelphia, San Francisco, and the Giants, respectively.
 
 
I'm wavering on SF-Pitt. Read a rave review of Pitt.... in the SF Chronicle.

Oooh, you're good.

panzade will add his picks tomorrow. The rest of the regulars are in with the following breakout:

San Francisco (2) @ Pittsburgh (18) - jes and osso going long
Arizona (5) @ Baltimore (14) - looking for a pick from Miz Doc
Indianapolis (16) @ Houston (4)
Detroit (17) @ Philadelphia (3) - Miz Doc, Pantalones, and edgar may know something the rest of us don't
Buffalo (1) @ New England (19) go West says jespah
San Diego (10) @ Green Bay (10) the PICK-EM game of the week
Miami (6) @ NY Jets (14)
Minnesota (12) @ Kansas City (8)
St. Louis (6) @ Tampa Bay (14)
Cleveland (13) @ Oakland (6) Tico?
Jacksonville (2) @ Denver (18) - CowDoc and Miz Doc -- Great minds thinking alike?
Cincinnati (8) @ Seattle (12)
NY Giants (2) @ Washington (18) Tico and rjb are out on the limb
Carolina (15) @ Atlanta (5)
Dallas (12) @ Chicago (8)

Tennessee (12) @ New Orleans (8)
 
 
 
NY Giants (2) @ Washington (18) Tico and rjb are out on the limb

 

If it is not too late, can I change my pick to the Redskins, which is what I had penciled in? I don't like the 'Skins but they are probably the better team this week. And the idea of being out on a limb with Tico is just plain scary.
 
 
coitenly, but you're gonna hate yourself when the Giants win.
 
 
Looks like New England stands alone with 19, while Pitts, Denver and Washington all get 18. We shall see.
 
 
Pittsburgh might switch to 19 once osso stops wavering.
 
 
 
Is your pick the A's then?
 

Yes, the A's beat the Indians in a squeaker.
 
 
 
 
NY Giants (2) @ Washington (18) Tico and rjb are out on the limb

OK...hopefully my last minute change is OK. no games are started, etc.

I'm jumping on Oakland Raiders bandwagon. Switch my pick to
Oakland Raiders over Cleveland Browns.

Famous last words: Sure hope I don't regret this.

Crap Kicker Predictions
OK..here's a new prediction game-within-a-game:

What games do you predict to be crap-kicker (lopsided) games?

I'll put down my first guesses and hope for others to put their guesses (and reputations) on the line:

Pats over Bills
Cowboys over Chicago
Pitts over SF 49ers
Indy over Houst. Texans
Wash. Skins over NY Giants

ragman:

Pats over Bills
Cowboys over Chicago- no
Pitts over SF 49ers - no
Indy over Houst. Texans - no
Wash. Skins over NY Giants - no
 
 
Good luck to all in Week #III. And congrats to JPB for keeping XXI kittens in line again.

Ragman, most of us know very little about football, much less about the particulars of the matchups. But I would suggest that the combined disparity betwixt the winners and losers of these 3 games will be greater than your first 3 games: NE vs Buffalo, Cleveland vs Oakland and Detroit vs Philly (I am no longer a fan of D. McNabb, who seems to forget the words of Billy Shakespeare: The Fault, Dear Brutus, Lies Not In Our Stars, But In Ourselves).

cool, Realjohnboy! Though, I think there are some very knowledgable fans here.

Let's see how your crap-kicker selections do vs. my picks. It's all for good fun.
 
 
Ragman, Pitts over SF is one I agree with.
 
 
hiya CI. I hope your Sunday is fun.

Yeah, CI! SF 49ers seem pretty disorganized - whearas, Pitts seems to be getting it together on both sides of the ball.
 
 
My wife and I are planning to go see a movie today; that'll be our "fun."
 
 
which movie?
 
 
hahaha...Donovan McNabb heard us dissing him. This game is 35 -7 in favor of Philly...early in the 2nd quarter. Must be those new uniforms of the Eagles.
 
 
Yeah, and Jespah is killing me in our fantasy football matchup with 27 points from WR Kevin Curtis of Philly.

chortle  
 
 
a game-within-a-game-within-a-game.

Well, Det/Philly game sure was a crap-kicker.
 
 
 
 
Is your pick the A's then?
 

Yes, the A's beat the Indians in a squeaker.
 

Check!

(my c'mon SD was too late, misread the data, schniff)
 
 
 
Detroit (17) @ Philadelphia (3) - Miz Doc, Pantalones, and edgar may know something the rest of us don't
 

Adding panzade's late choice, there seems to be some good crystal ball work going on here.
 
 
I think I am 7-2 through the early games. Philly was a big surprise.

Philly is always a big surprise to me, win or lose.
 
 
7-2, good going! My nose is above water, but not by much.
 
 
If it might be of help, Osso, there periodically appears an ad on A2K: Ask One Free Question. Call 1-800-Psychic. Credit cards only.
 
 
I'm a psychological mess, of course. I'm glad Arizona got so close. I'm glad Houston got close, wouldn't have minded if they'd won.
 
 
What am I looking for, parity? Nah, but I'm intrigued by the non-obvious.

SF could have used that defensive player, name I don't remember, who was injured...
 
 
Hah, our buddy is fooling with a2k at the moment...
 
 
We saw "Across The Universe" based on the Beatles' music. It was really well done; creatively done and adding a story to boot. I really enjoyed it, and give it a thumb's up!
 
 
 
I think I am 7-2 through the early games. Philly was a big surprise.
 

Yes, you are, rjb. Along with CowDoc, fbaezer, JPB, and lmur. RP, Pantalones, and panzade finished the early games at 8-1. jes, with two early wins seems to have her east-west mojo in reverse.

I'll post the week-to-date standings at the end of the late afternoon games.
 
 
 
Jacksonville (2) @ Denver (18) - CowDoc and Miz Doc -- Great minds thinking alike?
 

wow!
 
 
hmm. I have met Mr and Mrs Cowdoc. They look normal. But look into their eyes. They are aliens, both of them are aliens. We must banish them from this game. Now. They pose a threat, a real threat, to those of us who are red-blooded real people.
 
 
 
 
NY Giants (2) @ Washington (18) Tico and rjb are out on the limb

 

If it is not too late, can I change my pick to the Redskins, which is what I had penciled in? I don't like the 'Skins but they are probably the better team this week. And the idea of being out on a limb with Tico is just plain scary.
 

double WoW!

Tico is the lone winning wolf.
 
 
For the record, I picked Jacksonville because I didn't believe that Denver could pull three straight games out of their butts. Miz Cowdoc picked them simply because she doesn't like Denver. By the way, rjb, if you had looked closely enough into our eyes, you would know that we come from France.....we come from France..............we come from France............we come from France...................................................
 
 
This week's standing after the daytime game:

CowDoc 10
panzade 10
JPB 9

I'll do the machinations and manipulations of the numerous winning possibilities after tonight's game, but for now... here's the pick for tonight's game (Mr B is there cheering on his beloved Bears - that usually brings good karma to the Bears).

so much for predictions, huh?

So, am I correct (stat keeper) in saying that game 3 is the great leveller...tight group statistically. Now the fun begins
 
 
Rolls over, weeps, pops up, looks to the future...
 
 
 
For the record you would know that we come from France....
 

I noticed the French accent, which seemed kind of strange if yall are really from Idaho. Really from Idaho? My grandmother spoke only German, but once in awhile she would speak a phrase or two of English, one of which is appropriate for me here: I think I will go eat worms.
 
 
Ragman and osso... this is where the additional stat of week-to-week place standings and variations comes into play. We may well end up looking at that overall placement as equally valuable as the seasonal win-loss ratio.

Go Bears!!!!

I don't like the Bears much, but as a lifelong Giants fan, I HATE the Cowboys.
 
 
rjb, Our mother only spoke Japanese and a spattering of English, and she was born in this country (Portland, OR)! Her father took her back to Japan when young, and her brother remained in Japan.

Leaving you...
 
 
I'm a statistics fool, though I do read this and that. I'm glad for some teams past my choices, and have boredom or distaste for some teams I picked. 'tis a game to me, and not all for the winning. If I ever do get serious, you'll all hear about it early on..
 
 
Grossman SUCKS!

Ok, nevermind... here's where we are in week three with one game remaining, along with the Monday night pick for those folks looking to win this one.

panzade 11 - Saints (46)
CowDoc 10 - Saints (can't catch panzade)
fbaezer 10 - Titans (44)
realjohnboy 10 - Saints (can't catch panzade)
JPB 9
Pantalones 9
Ragman 9
Region Philbis 9
cicerone imposter 9

LionTamerX 8
Mrs CowDoc 8
jpinMilwaukee 8
wandeljw 8
Ticomaya 7
edgarblythe 7
ossobuco 7
Cycloptichorn 6
jespah 6

panzade and fbaezer are fighting it out to the end. With a Titans win we'll be looking at a two point difference in the tie-breaker. Good luck to both of you!
 
 
I'm dropping one every week. By the last week, I should have zero picks. ha ha ha...
 
 
From the top to the bottom. I suck.

Cycloptichorn
 
 
 
From the top to the bottom. I suck.

So?

I have been consistently mediocre. Do you think that is any better?
 
 
 
panzade 11 - Saints (46)
CowDoc 10 - Saints (can't catch panzade)
fbaezer 10 - Titans (44)
realjohnboy 10 - Saints (can't catch panzade)
 

I don't know what I was looking at yesterday, but imagine my surprise when I saw a three-way tie for first place after last night's game. Looking back into the data, I see that rjb had the Titans picked with 34 as the total score. So well done to panzade, fbaezer, and rjb with 11 correct picks. Now here's where it gets tricky...

The total score of last night's game was 45 points. panzade and fbaezer each missed that by 1 point in opposite directions. Prior to the start of the season we established a second level tie-breaker giving the weekly win to the person with the lower seasonal place standing going into the current week. After last week's game the overall standings were,

 
fbaezer (19-12 0.594 12)

panzade (22-10 0.688 3)
 

so, fbaezer gets the first place points this week! Congrats to fbaezer. panzade and rjb will get second place points and the rest of us lowly souls will trickle down from there.

I'll add up the rest of the wins and losses and post the weekly summary in a few...
 
 
tiebreaker works how?  

Oh well....bien hecho papi!

Ragman and lmur remain tied for first place overall with 34 wins. panzade is only one game back. RP with 32 wins is within striking distance of the lead, as are CowDoc, ci, and ehbeth with 31/48. The rest of us have some work to do but I've no doubt we'll tighten up over the next few weeks.
 
 
 
tiebreaker works how?  

Oh well....bien hecho papi!
 

First level tiebreaker is total points scored in Monday night's game. If still tied after first level tiebreaker then lower overall standing after prior week. You were in third place overall, fbaezer was in 12th, so fbaezer gets the underdog boost.

yeah... I just never heard of a second tier tie breaker going to the trailing player...but enough...I accept my defeat...gracefully
 
 
And the (consistency) awards go to Ragman and jespah. Unfortunately for jes, this isn't such a good thing in terms of overall ranking. Ragman also has the best average weekly place ranking. RP and panzade are consistently on top as well. Hanging out in the hot tub with jes are Tico, jp, and Miz Doc. The rest of us have assorted variability ranging from ci's 3.21 to fbaezer's 9.87. kicky and chiso did not play the last two weeks.

great job crunching the numbers...adds a lot to the game jpb  
 
 
Thank You, JPB! (My variability is only 3.51. That is what I supposed it would be.)
 
 
Sorry, but I had no way to play, thanks to baiting tactics by some trolls of A2K. Funny, they could have played though I couldn't....
 
 
You're still in the database, cj. Give us your picks for this weekend's game (I'll post the choices later this afternoon) and we'll move forward from here.

Right. In our Fantasy Football matchup this week, Jespah clobbered me. No mercy there.

Well done, JPB. It was fortunate that the 2nd level tiebreaker was put in place this year. We saw this situation coming.
And can you punch a button to display the overall standings for the year in descending order?

(and by the way, if I hadn't changed my pick in the Giants-Skins game...)

Awesome statistical work!

The Amazing Giorgio's predictions were all accurate.
It's reality that screwed up.
 
 
Awesome stats work. I gotta admit to a special (nerdy) thrill to seeing the detail. I've long been amazed at how repeatable/predictable and also how non-repeatable pro sports can be. Also amazed at how good and how bad we can be at guessing about their repeatability and predictability.

Here's some random thoughts:
After Monday night's game, l'll not be expecting much from NO Saints with Brees as QB. Right now, he (and they) seem psychologically beaten. I sure do hope they get it together 'cause that N'yawlins area needs them to be winners and not the 'Aints' of old.

Wonder how my NE Pats will do against Cincy Bengals? Cincy sure knows how to score.

I'm watching a few teams closely -- the Dallas Cowboys and Houston Texans and for different reasons. The 'Boys 'cause they look to be the class of the NFC and, the Texans 'cause they're a surprisingly strong team and a potential upsetter of the status quo.

Looking for a trend now to show itself for Week #4 - Week #10...that defense SHOULD start to take over. Looking over the high scores, it seems that offense has dominated so far, overall. Expecting overall defense to start digging in.
 
 
Musing along with you, Ragman, while waiting for JPB to post the schedule for week #IV. It seems to me to be a relatively easier week. I was able to pencil in my picks without much problem (which of course means little since I don't know much about football).
I have noticed that Dallas, thus far, has scored (points for=PF) 116 while St Louis has but 32. Dallas is definitely back.
Houston is in the the middle of the pack with 78 PF but Atlanta really sucks with a mere 30. (That nice young man, Michael Vick of Atlanta and formerly of VA Tech now faces state charges in addition to Federal charges to which he has pleaded guilty, by the way). Cincy-NE could well be one of the better games of the week. Both teams can score (PF: Cincy 93 vs NE 114 but Points against (PA): 95 vs 35 favors NE.
New Orleans is idle this week but they look weak.

Eh, well at least I did well there.  

PS Is there a list of the next matchups anywhere? I gotta pick the Northern cities.

Oops, I've given away my extraordinarily successful strategy.

It is a strategy, but I'll keep that a secret for now. LOL
 
 
I'll post this weekend's games in a minute. If someone knows of a site that lists the games and standings that I can use, I will be eternally grateful.
 
 
Jes, there was some extraordinary thread back in 2002 or 3 or 4 about climate and productivity... which you will probably remember...

I'm afraid I never took stats. I had friends who found it their Waterloo course. But just like physics, I'd bet I'd like stats in adult life.

Meantime, I don't get what I'm seeing re what happened for the list of us. Almost but not quite. I guess I don't get why Raggy isn't at 0.0 or 1.0. What is this 2 stuff?

Not as a nag, but sometime within the thread, could you 'splain more, jpb, re the numbers I'm seeing? Trust me, I don't doubt you.
 
 
The sites I've looked don't do all that well re us as a group... sometimes, if not every week.

Just want to say yer doin' a fine job, JPB.

G'night America.
 
 
Green Bay (3-0) at Minnesota (1-2) GB. Favre at 38 is awesome. Even Gus will have to admit that.
Oakland (1-2) at Miami (0-3) Oakland. Two bad teams.
NY Jets (1-2) at Buffalo (0-3) Jets. Buffalo has no offense. None.
Houston (2-1) at Atlanta (0-3) Houston. They are pretty good. The Falcons are not.
Chicago (1-2) at Detroit (2-1) Detroit. Bye, bye, Grossman. Root for the Cubs.
Baltimore (2-1) at Cleveland (1-2) Baltimore. Cleveland leads the league in points allowed. A long day for Cleveland.
St. Louis (0-3) at Dallas (3-0) Dallas. Their offense is good.
Tampa Bay (2-1) at Carolina (2-1) TB. Carolina can't seem to get it together. I may be wrong about this one.
Seattle (2-1) at San Francisco (2-1) Um, Seattle
Kansas City (1-2) at San Diego (1-2) San Diego. KC has scored only 26 points all season.
Pittsburgh (3-0) at Arizona (1-2) PITTSBURGH (my team)
Denver (2-1) at Indianapolis (3-0) Indy. They can score points. Should be a good game.
Philadelphia (1-2) at NY Giants (1-2) Philly. Maybe I was harsh about McNabb.

New England (3-0) at Cincinnati (1-2). NE. Could be close but the Pats defense is better. 54 points in total.

Sure thing, osso. Bright and early tomorrow when my brain starts working again.

Actually, that particular stat is just the average of the weekly 'place' scores (first place, second place, etc). Ragman had first, third, and fourth place finishes for the three weeks. Those scores average out to 2.67 with a standard deviation (measure of how much scatter or variability there is around the average number by the individual values) of 1.53. Simply put, that means that the individual numbers tend to be within 1.5 of the average. Now, my place finishes for the three weeks are 23rd, 7th, and 10th which average out to 13.33 with a deviation of 8.5, indicating that my scores have been all over the place. Someone else could have finished in 13th, 13th, and 14th place and have the same 13.33 average but the standard deviation would only be 0.58 meaning they are much more consistent than I am. Clear as mud?

Thank you all for the kudos. It's why you're paying me the big bucks. I've got some ideas for further down the road to post some individual stats but I need to figure out how to post graphs first.

Miami -- Oakland, you had your win.
Buffalo -- I never pick the Jets (unless they play the Giants (though I
did pick them in SB III (which of course was a special occasion (to say
nothing of historic)))
Houston -- Atlanta is nearing punch-line status.
Chicago -- They find their running game.
Baltimore -- This could get ugly.
Dallas -- Should make a lot of trips to the end zone.
Carolina -- I haven't a clue, so I'll go home team.
Seattle -- I like Hasselbeck.
San Diego -- They'll be out to prove something.
Pittsburgh -- How blah is Arizona?
Indianapolis -- The team to beat.
Philadelphia -- I never pick the Giants.

New England -- I always pick the Patriots.

I was able to get through to Sublime by text message. His computer is dead but he's otherwise fine.
 
 
Almost ready.

I'm having trouble identifying food identified with Tampa Bay and Denver.
 
 
Gulf shrimp for Tampa? I'm equally clueless about Denver.
 
 
I'm starting to think that breaded pork tenderloin (pretty much schnitzel, right?) will trump anything Denver has to offer.

hmmm shrimp vs peaches/Vidalia onions
