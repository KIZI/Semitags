Engineer charged with copying proprietary documents and trying
to sell them in China

The Justice Department charged a former Ford Motor Co. engineer
with stealing company secrets and trying to peddle them to Chinese
competitors.

Chinese-born Xiang Dong Yu -- also known as Mike Yu -- was
arrested Wednesday at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport when
he tried to re-enter the country from China. The 47-year-old is
charged with five counts of theft of trade secrets, attempted theft
of trade secrets and unauthorized access to a protected computer.

According to a federal indictment unsealed Wednesday, Yu was a
product engineer for Ford from 1997 to 2007 and had access to Ford
trade secrets. Law enforcement officials say that, just prior to
leaving the Dearborn automaker, Yu copied thousands of confidential
documents, including what they described as "sensitive Ford design
documents" and "system design specification documents."

The Justice Department says these documents contained
proprietary information about Ford's engine and transmission
mounting subsystems, electrical distribution systems, power
supplies, electrical subsystems and generic body modules.

Prosecutors allege that Yu began taking documents to China as
early as 2005 in a bid to secure employment with a Chinese
automotive company.

In late 2006, they say he was hired by PCE Industry Inc., a
California-based subsidiary of a Taiwanese electronics company,
Foxconn. Before leaving Ford, Yu allegedly copied approximately
4,000 sensitive Ford documents onto a portable hard drive and
transported them to Shenzhen, China -- Foxconn's manufacturing hub.

No one could be reached for comment at either PCE or Foxconn.

The government further alleges that, while working at Foxconn in
2008, Yu again tried unsuccessfully to use some of the documents he
allegedly stole from Ford to get a job with another Chinese
company, the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp. When that failed,
he accepted a job with Chinese automaker Beijing Automotive Corp.

Neither of those companies could be reached for comment.

      Ford cooperating with feds

      Ford said it was aware of the situation.

"We're fully cooperating with authorities as they pursue the
case," said spokeswoman Marcey Evans.

The theft and attempted theft of trade secrets counts each carry
a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. The
computer-related charge carries a maximum penalty of five years and
a $250,000 fine.

'Serious federal offense'

"Protecting the competitive-edge technology of our companies
through vigorous enforcement of our federal trade secret laws is a
top priority of this office," said U.S. Attorney Terrence Berg.
"Both employees and employers should be aware that stealing
proprietary trade secrets to gain an economic advantage is a
serious federal offense that will be prosecuted aggressively."

The FBI was in charge of the investigation that led to Yu's
arrest.

"Michigan, as well as the rest of the United States, is
significantly impacted by the auto industry. Theft of trade secrets
is a threat to national security, and investigating allegations
involving theft of trade secrets is a priority for the FBI," said
FBI chief Andrew Arena. "The FBI will continue to aggressively
pursue these cases."

Yu remains in federal custody and is scheduled to have a
detention hearing in Chicago on Tuesday.

Analyst Jim Hall of 2953 Analytics LLP in Birmingham said it is
hard to know just how damaging the leaking of this information
could be for Ford.

"These could be things a competitor could discover simply by
buying a car and reverse-engineering it," he said. "It could be
something much more sensitive."
