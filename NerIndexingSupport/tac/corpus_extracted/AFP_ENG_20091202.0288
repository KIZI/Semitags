US computer giant Dell on Wednesday said it will sell a computer production
facility in Lodz, central Poland, to Taiwan's Foxconn group, Dell Polska
spokesman Rafal Branowski told AFP.

"Today we have announced our plan to transfer ownership of the Lodz production
facility to Taiwan's Foxconn company," Branowski said in a telephone interview.

"The plan must still be approved by the European Commission and this will take
several months," he added.

"Nothing will change as far as production is concerned at Lodz," Branowski said.
