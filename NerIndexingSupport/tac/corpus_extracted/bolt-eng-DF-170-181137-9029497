game of the day, NE @ Pitt.....so I have a conundrum, who to root for or against?.....how about a tie  

 

Cheatriots od Stealers? I have to go with Cheatriots.
 
 
What is with the upsets brewing in the first half? Arizona beating up the Ravens (who do not look like an elite AFC team), Miami beating the Giants (this one, at least, is close), the Rams currently shutting out the Saints? Odd, odd things.
 
 
Go not the Giants! Go not the Giants!

 
 
 
go rams!!!!!!!!
go....uhm Colts..  
 
 
shitfuck, Giants go ahead...  
 
 
 
game of the day, NE @ Pitt.....so I have a conundrum, who to root for or against?.....how about a tie  

 

The Japanese love a tie in sports.
Are you turning Japanese?
I'm an Eags fan, but am rooting for the Steelers as my step-son is a diehard Steelers fan. Big Ben had a great game last week and eye-popping NE early season offensive stats are trailing off.
If BR can put two games together, Steelers eek out a win.
 
 
the vikes got lucky, man oh man.....how does he miss that?
 
 
And the LIONS are back again!!!!
 
 
This just in: Tavarus Jackson is a very, very bad QB.
 
 
I soooooo need Jabar Gaffney to get a TD.

Rashard Mendenhall, too.
 
 
Steelers pounding the Pats

No miracles for Tebow......just more bad quarterbacking
 
 
Hahahahahaha....f*ck you Lil' Brady Boy....      

Whohooo....Cheatriots - go HOME!!!

STEELERS
 
 
 
Hahahahahaha....f*ck you Lil' Brady Boy....

STEELERS

 

I knew you'd slink out when it was safe  
 
 
Birds have a really good chance of only being tied for last by evening's end.    

Here we go!
 
 
 
Go not the Giants! Go not the Giants!

 

 

Giants win to go 5-2

They pick up ground regardless of who wins Dallas-Philly
 
 
Cowboys look like shit.
 
 
What the hell is going on here?   Is it 2004? Cause this feels like a trick!
 
 
Eagles are doing what they want against Dallas
 
 
Hell, the eagles are doing everything they haven't been able to do all season.

Anyone seen the Dallas Defense? They seem to be missing.............

As they should, and must at this point!  

See ya on the 20th. We have unfinished business.  
 
 
While we are looking for the Dallas defense, keep an eye out for the Offense too. I think they left the field........
 
 
Pfft. So much for our shutout. Well that's just GREAT.  
 
 
Well the Niners let Cleveland hang around longer than they should have (2nd and goal from the 1 after review calls back a Gore td, and you can't score? wtf) but still got the win. 6-1....the division is all but won, and considering the ease on paper of their schedule, 12 wins is doable.

The NFC East doesn't have a clear leader. I know the Giants are 5-2, but barely squeaking by Miami and having very little in the way of a running game makes me hesitant to consider them dominant in the division.

Who's the best of the AFC? I'd have said the Pats, but the Steelers pretty much manhandled them. Baltimore did a great job coming back from down 21, but how do you get down 21 to the Cards in the first place? The Steelers are looking strong after that win, but can they maintain? They have looked somewhat out of sync a lot this year, and they are another team you expect to run the ball with a suspect running game. Oh, and the Bills are quietly keeping pace with the top teams.

Detroit showed their 2 losses were not indicative of the team falling apart. Again a team that can't run very well, but like the Packers, they really don't need to. A nice defensive performance, too. I want to say it and I will : they are a legit contender this year. As long as Stafford stays healthy, they are.

What the hell happened to the Saints?!

Cincinnati is also quietly keeping pace in the AFC. Are they, and are the Bills, for real?

Poor Carolina fans. So much promise with the way Newton is playing, but the wins aren't quite there. If they could run more consistently to keep some of the pressure off of Newton, they would be much better.

Houston is looking like they are finally going to get to the playoffs as the pundits have been predicting for the past few years, by winning the division.

The Colts suck. Badly. I think that some of the crazy talk I've heard, about drafting Luck and trading Manning, might not be so far-fetched. This looks like a team that needs to rebuild, not just get their qb back. Could they get 2 first rounders+ for Manning, if he's healthy? Do they see themselves as needing to rebuild, or is the shock of losing possibly the best qb in the league still making the losses seem reasonable?

Maybe the Skins could get Manning! They love to overpay for free agents, and Beck doesn't seem like the answer any more than Grossman.

Did I mention the Niners are 6-1?  

I think the Chargers are going to get it together and beat the Chiefs Monday night, but if the Chiefs pull it off, I might become a believer.

How was I only 2-5 going into this week when I have Foster, Gore and Sproles?  
 
 
 
 
Hahahahahaha....f*ck you Lil' Brady Boy....      

Whohooo....Cheatriots - go HOME!!!

STEELERS

 

I knew you'd slink out when it was safe  

 

I was way to seriously watching the game...

Great things about yesterday's game:

Pittsburgh defensive line is BADLY beat up, 4 positions on injury list - yet, they buried the Patriots.
Tom Bieber...er...Tom Brady didn't even throw 200 yards, only had one offensive TD, and fumbled the ball on the Pats last play to give the Steelers a safety.

If it wasn't for a questionable call in the 1st half giving the Patriots a fresh 1st down on the 2 yard line - they would have had only 10 points in the game.
 
 
So who were those people wearing the Cowboy Uniforms for Halloween?

Someone needs to remind them they are a little old for trick or treat.........
 
 
I loved how Denver threw Tim Tebow to the wolves, or Lions to be exact

They basically showed their fans....if you want Tebow, here is what you will get

Well, the Denver playcalling wasn't very helpful, they needed plays to get the ball out of his hands before the Detroit pass rush gets to him, which they did and he didn't. Denver's passblocking wasn't real good either, but let's face it, the kid is still pretty raw. It takes 3 years to make a decent NFL QB, and he needs help that he ain't getting right now. From anybody, including his own coaching staff.
 
 
I was shocked at how pathetic the Redskins were, if you can't score on Buffalo then you're kinda fucked.
 
 
 
 
Go not the Giants! Go not the Giants!

 

 

Giants win to go 5-2

They pick up ground regardless of who wins Dallas-Philly

 

Who you play next week?
Oh, that's right, New England.....OOOPS!.
Repeat after me; 5 and 3.

You sure you are as good as you think?

Not sure Denver threw Tebow to the Lions, but Fox Sports and the NFL Channel certainly did him no favors. They spent all week building him up as some triumphant hero that COULD BEAT THE DOLPHINS!!! IN OVER TIME!!!! TEBOW TIME!!!!!

What idiots. Typical Media Parrots.

I noticed by the second half they stopped squaking about TIM TOBOW, and started babbling about CHAMP BAILY

Not yet......any given sunday, etc.
Are you sure the 'dream team' has not begun to finally gel, tho'?
 
 
The most wonderful moment in football yesterday....when Tom Bieber....err Tom Brady fumbled to give Pittsburgh a safety.
Icing on the cake

Was the 2nd weekend in a row of lackluster matchups, except for a few. So, Tebow time was the hype to get ratings.
Vegas books cleaned up this last weekend as bettors still gonna bet, despite the ratings and any given sunday hype.
 
 
 
Eagles are doing what they want against Dallas

 

I think Ollie needs the concept of 'WINNING' broken down to him.......(Sorry Ollie, Eags vs. Cowgirls, I couldn't resist!)

 CHARLIE SHEEN - WINNING - YouTube

You see here is the concept. I am and have always been a Cowboys fan. It doesn't matter if they win or lose I am still a fan. I do not remember a time when I was not a Dallas Cowboy fan.

And nearly every year, and nearly every game, it doesn't matter if the Boys lose, the other team knew that they had played the Cowboys.

How loyal are you to your team? I can make jokes and even cuss out the Boys when they have a game like last night. I've earned the right. That is Winning..

SFC, BUT, it was the Eagles!
I was born (1953) an Eagles fan, so, so much for your loyalty question. If we win only two games out of the season, and both games are against the Cowboys, that is WINNING!!!
You're 13 pt. favorites over Seattle next week, so if you beat those schlubbs, I guess you'll think that you are REALLY winning..........  .

We are the same age.

The difference is, you don't understand.............

After politics and religion, sports is probably where I'd think fighting would be most likely.   And sports is possibly even less rational than political or religious fights!
