11 accused of faking voter registration cards in Miami-Dade

 jlebovich@MiamiHerald.com 
Eleven people hired to register potential voters in Miami-Dade County before last year's presidential election were being sought Wednesday for falsifying hundreds of voter registration cards.

The Miami-Dade State Attorney's Office issued arrest warrants for each of the 11 suspects, all of whom worked for the local chapter of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, (ACORN).

By early Wednesday morning, six were in custody, authorities said.

ACORN came under fire during last year's presidential campaign when Republicans and other conservative groups accused the national organization of committing fraud in its aggressive voter registration efforts in various cities and counties nationwide, including Florida.

But ACORN officials said they had alerted authorities about the alleged illegal activity among some canvassers in Miami-Dade after finding ``numerous discrepancies'' on voter cards collected from the Homestead area.

The arrests are ``further evidence we've been policing our own folks and report people attempting to commit voter registration fraud,'' said ACORN spokesman Brian Kettenring. ``This was really some individuals who were trying to defraud their employer.''

President Obama sent them out. But he's not the one throwing them under any bus. It is not the "Justice [sic] Department" that is going after these alleged criminals. It is a State/local prosecutor's office.

I mean, really. Does anybody imagine that this Administration would take a hand in trying to root out voter fraud when liberal Democratics are the intended beneficiaries?

What a totally stupid remark. But then that's all we seem to get these days from the disgruntled right wingers.

Go back and check out the shit the right wing did during the 2000 election in Florida.

I notice no ACORN officials have been arrested. ACORN is the little nut the nuts on the right bring out every election.

Oh right...President Obama personally rang these guys up and said "Yo! Fellas! How 'bout heppin' me out here and get some fake signature on some registration ballots..."

Also, do you honestly believe that the Justice Department doesn't have bigger fish to fry than going after a few goofballs who would be charged with third degree felonies?

Instead of giving our tax money to ACORN, they should be prosecuted under RICO

I don't think 2008 has been analyzed yet, but here's a good synopsis of all the shenanigans that have gone on before. The holier-than-thou Republican Party operatives are just as guilty, if not more so.

 Obama and Acorn - WSJ.com 

 
OCTOBER 14, 2008
Obama and Acorn
Community organizers, phony voters, and your tax dollars
...
Which brings us to Mr. Obama, who got his start as a Chicago "community organizer" at Acorn's side. In 1992 he led voter registration efforts as the director of Project Vote, which included Acorn. This past November, he lauded Acorn's leaders for being "smack dab in the middle" of that effort. Mr. Obama also served as a lawyer for Acorn in 1995, in a case against Illinois to increase access to the polls.

During his tenure on the board of Chicago's Woods Fund, that body funneled more than $200,000 to Acorn. More recently, the Obama campaign paid $832,000 to an Acorn affiliate. The campaign initially told the Federal Election Commission this money was for "staging, sound, lighting." It later admitted the cash was to get out the vote.

The Obama campaign is now distancing itself from Acorn, claiming Mr. Obama never organized with it and has nothing to do with illegal voter registration. Yet it's disingenuous to channel cash into an operation with a history of fraud and then claim you're shocked to discover reports of fraud. As with Rev. Jeremiah Wright and William Ayers, Mr. Obama was happy to associate with Acorn when it suited his purposes. But now that he's on the brink of the Presidency, he wants to disavow his ties.

The Justice Department needs to treat these fraud reports as something larger than a few local violators. The question is whether Acorn is systematically subverting U.S. election law -- on the taxpayer's dime.

A 17-year timeframe. BFD. None of this means anything. There have been Republican voter registration organizations that engaged in fraud as well, but they didn't seem to make the Wall Street Journal. Surprise, surprise.

Acorn remains one of many community outreach organizations operating legally, in spite of some of its "volunteers" pushing the limits of legality. But the way you people love to distort the Obama-Acorn relationship is but one of your many desperate reaches. Other major corporations have sunk millions into voter outreach organizations in order to assure a certain candidate wins in a district. Legislators themselves have engaged in questionable activities (read: Tom DeLay). Probably the biggest fraud of all was perpetrated by Diebold which had open commitments to the Republican Party, and of course they had the capability to rig their voting machines to make that happen, and there was plenty of proof that they did, but you never saw it in the WSJ. Of course all of that is conveniently forgotten, now that we've got a Democrat in the White House, a Democrat who is verbally spat upon in every public forum by people who would sell their sisters into slavery just to see him brought down.

Hey dopey: Before you shoot off your rather unintelligent mouth, you might want to give -- oh, I don't know -- at least a tiny little bit of thought to knowing what you're spewing about.

ACORN QC are the ones who caught this and turned these people in. In fact, that was what the bulk of the article in the OP talked about yet it was summarily ignored.

 
But ACORN officials said they had alerted authorities about the alleged illegal activity among some canvassers in Miami-Dade after finding ``numerous discrepancies'' on voter cards collected from the Homestead area.

Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernández Rundle praised ACORN.

``We've been very aggressive about a lot of these cases,'' she said. ``But we would not have known about these workers unless ACORN brought it to us.

``It's really minor, ineffectual attempts to justify getting paid an hourly basis. It could not have impacted the voting process whatsoever. Nonetheless, we cannot turn a blind eye to this,'' Rundle added.

ACORN quality control workers found the discrepancies in the cards turned in by 10 canvassers and contacted authorities in June 2008, authorities said. The group turned in 1,400 cards, of which 888 were found to be fraudulent.

Artie {I can call you Artie, can't I, Artie?   },

I would suggest that it is not quite accurate to say that that facet of the story got "ignored" when it is in the very excerpt which I chose to post.

I would further offer a little speculation. IF (spitballing here, of course, but just "if") the ACORN honchos were of the belief that the behavior (the alleged criminal acts) of some of their members had already been discovered, what might be the rational response of those ACORN honchos, even if they had previously condoned the (alleged) criminal behavior? Might it not be to come forward to "report" their "concerns?" {" I'm shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here! "}

Pre-emptive spin! {"Your winnings, sir. "}

Eleven people hired to register potential voters in Miami-Dade County before last year's presidential election were being sought Wednesday for falsifying hundreds of voter registration cards.

The Miami-Dade State Attorney's Office issued arrest warrants for each of the 11 suspects, all of whom worked for the local chapter of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, (ACORN).

By early Wednesday morning, six were in custody, authorities said.

ACORN came under fire during last year's presidential campaign when Republicans and other conservative groups accused the national organization of committing fraud in its aggressive voter registration efforts in various cities and counties nationwide, including Florida.

But ACORN officials said they had alerted authorities about the alleged illegal activity among some canvassers in Miami-Dade after finding ``numerous discrepancies'' on voter cards collected from the Homestead area.

You have given out too much Reputation in the last 24 hours, try again later.
 
 
In every single case, against Acorn workers, that has been presented on this site that i participated in or that i had read about, the fraudulent registrations from workers of ACORN...were TURNED IN TO THE AUTHORITIES, by ACORN themselves....

YOU would NOT HAVE something to bitch about or writers to write about for a newspaper on these Acorn employee/registration fraud, IF IT HAD NOT BEEN for Acorn themselves, turning them in to the authorities.

this doesn't diminish the fact that there are several of their temp hired workers who have simply committed this fraud for a paycheck....in a ton of their operating areas...

How can this be stopped? What can be done to lessen the hiring of people that obviously are not of the caliber that should be hired for such an important job....

Acorn, and the community itself that they are suppose to be helping, gets hurt by these employees committing fraud....hundreds if not thousands of fake registrations with Mickey mouse and other names on them does not bring more people in the community to the polls....it ties up acorn in to paying these people to bring in new voters from a community, while the rotten lot are sitting home making up names and addresses of fictitious people...other REAL people from their communities who ARE eligible to vote and who are not registered, don't get gotten to....

There has to be a better way for these groups to pick their employees and not hire so many slackers and corrupt individuals?
