EDIT : Actually, isn't Justin Bieber as close as you can get to a girl without actually being a girl?

Lol, me and my friend were having a jokey discussion about it. All my friends have commented on this as a joke  
 
 
 
Zyzz.

 

 

Lol? You mean a man who has made his living by trolling the internet and lifting weights without even competing in a competition that would justify it?
Also, Steroids = Small penis  

Btw, Am jelly.

Someone pass me a shotgun.

You obviously have no education in such a matter considering Anabolic Steroids have no detrimental effect to the size of the Male Penis. Instead Anabolic Steroids cause temporary testicle shrinkage.

Competing =/= Aesthetic accomplishments.

Except they do have a detrimental effect on male biology in general, commonly characterized by the deterioration of a mans libido, giving rise to the common assumptions that his 'penis' has become smaller, this doesn't necessarily mean in the physical sense either. It just means a mans natural sex drive has been suppressed somewhat because anabolic steroids do what they say in the name, increase muscle mass conversion rates at the expense of supplying materials to other systems, one of them being, the reproduction system.

Aesthetic accomplishments? Well, Aesthetics is an entirely subjective view now isn't it? You can't precisely pigeonhole what makes good aesthetics and then apply it to every person, thereby making any 'achievement' through aesthetics imperceptible as an accomplishment to every human being rather than just a select few.

HOWZAT?
 
 
Olivia Wilde

Sexual Drive/impotence =/= Male Penis size which can actually grow due to the enhancement of the androgenic effects of testosterone, which of course, causes growth in men's physical sexual characteristics e.g. penis size and erection.

It's a catch 22. But nonetheless doesn't cause penis shrinkage which is why your original argument is entirely invalid.
 
 
 
chick that plays gloria on modern family. yummy

Would probably not hesitate either
 
 
Selma Hayek  
 
 
Lady Gaga. I'm not sure if that's weird or not.
 
 
 
Suuuuuuree  

 

I would appreciate a man's relative attractiveness compared to an average man in things like aesthetics and face proportions but just the thought of seeing another man without pants is an instant turnoff no matter how good his aesthetics are or his face...one thing I appreciate is rare eye colour (eventhough its fairly rare, blue doesnt rank that high for me) especially green...
 
 
Rupert Grint, obviously.
 
 
 
Who would it be ? :P Applies to both men and women.

I'd go for Hugh Jackman anyday  

 

weird, was thinking the same thing. saw 'the fountain' just the other day, may be why. when he was drinking that sticky white sap from the tree of life, oh my. odd.

So many people are unfairly answering the question, as they clearly actually do want the people they are posting! Nothing wrong with that, but I was expecting more reluctance from the guys   (some of you need a moment of reflection to realise you are in fact not completely straight   )

Not a homophobe.

I can't think of one to be honest.

Also, that picture on the other page of Kate Moss (the one with the leg) made me actually do this irl:  . Her leg is ****ing horrible.

In case people cba to look back:

 
 
 
Jonathan Rhys Meyers  

 

and/or

 

Robert Downey Jr. (SHERLOCK HOLMES / IRON MAN)

Is this a trick question? I feel like this is...
 
 
Sorry, impossible. Muscular guys are too manly. And feminine guys are just weird

Jonathan Groff

Right, let me start off by throwing a no homo out there...

 

Marco Borriello (A.S. Roma striker)

Does it just have to be us or can it be a threesome with his ex Belen Rodriguez?  
 
 
Cheryl Cole:
 

Amanda Holden:
 
 
 
 
steroids =/= small penis

pls troll moar

 

I think if you go back and read a bit I have already responded to this. 'Small penis' be analogous to diminished sex drive/impotency.
