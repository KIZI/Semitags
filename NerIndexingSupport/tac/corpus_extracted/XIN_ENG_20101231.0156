Three people died in a storm that swept through Missouri state, the United
States, on Friday, the Missouri Department of Public Safety said.

State Governor Nixon has signed an executive order to declare a state of
emergency in Missouri in response to severe weather that began late Thursday
night.

The weather system has involved tornadoes and high winds in communities across
Missouri, local media reported.

Initial reports indicate that these storms have resulted in at least three
deaths, multiple injuries and damage to homes, buildings and property.
