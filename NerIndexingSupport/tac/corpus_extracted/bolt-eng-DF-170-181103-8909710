 Obama Said to Consider William Daley for Top Post, Possibly Chief of Staff - Bloomberg 

 
President Barack Obama is considering naming William Daley, a JPMorgan Chase & Co. executive and former U.S. Commerce secretary, to a high-level administration post, possibly White House chief of staff, people familiar with the matter said.

 

Congratulations Obama on being one of the biggest corporate, banker whores to have ever graced the White House.  

It's obvious who really operates the United States. It's all one gargantuan banker/corporate/government circlejerk.

This is true.

Obama's Administration is full of corporate whores and very very few actual progressives.

Is there anyone still out there that believes this man is progressive in any way, shape, or form?
 
 
Being progressive is all about being a corporate whore.

That garbage about their standing up for "the little guy" is but a ruse to take in the gullible.

But that has been common knowledge, for all those willing to face the facts, for at least a century....To wit:

Kass: Billy Daley as Obama's chief of staff? I love it, love it, love it

A reader wise in the Chicago Way called to welcome me back from Christmas vacation and asked me about the big Bill Daley news.

"Bill Daley as Obama's chief of staff?" said the guy. "You've got to be kidding me. You've got to hate it."

No, actually, I don't hate it.

I love it. Love it, love it, love it.

William Daley being considered as President Barack Obama's chief of staff  even if Billy floated the trial balloon himself  is fantastic news.

The national political experts are prattling on and on about Billy, saying that as an investment banker and "pragmatist," he'll bring Obama back to the political center.

Right now, Obama sits somewhere to the left of the late George McGovern, but he'll need to become a certified centrist again when he runs for re-election in 2012.

From where I'm sitting, Billy going to the Obama White House is much better than the alternative. He's a big-shot banker at JPMorgan Chase, and the bank is a major creditor in the Tribune Co. bankruptcy.

Once this newspaper emerges from bankruptcy, Daley's bank will be a major stockholder. And the last thing I need is Billy moving into a posh Tribune Tower office and sending me pithy e-mails like this one:

"John, how do you like your new assignment covering the City Council in Goose Bay, Labrador? Is it really, really cold up over by dere? Next stop, Greenland! :-) Just don't let them tell you there's no political machine in Northern Canada. Stay warm, 'The Goose Bay Way.' LOL. Keep it real, Bill."

Clearly, Bill needs another vocation, and I'm all for him running the White House. I'm almost as excited as I was a few years ago, when Obama selected another Daley machine guy, Rahm Emanuel, to become his first chief of staff.

Before the Rahmfather was tapped by Obama, there was far too much emotional oozing from the media. The media was so enraptured about Obama's promise to "transcend the broken politics of the past," that they forgot he was a Chicago politician. Instead, they wiggled like excited puppies and left many wet spots on the carpet.

The Emanuel appointment was the first honest indicator that the Obama White House had a new Washington address:

1600 Chicago Way.

And a Daley appointment will punctuate that. For all the blah-blah-blah about Billy Daley bringing Obama to the center, there's one thing the analysts forget...

 
 
 
Decidely awful move.
 
 
Bill Daley will pretend Obama is a centrist, while Carol Browner and Lisa Jackson over at the EPA will kick and tax what's left of business to the curb.

Sounds like a winning strategy for 2012.

I wouldn't go as far as you do here, but I'll agree this is NOT a good move.

I remember Obama briefly addressing concerns about keeping/bringing on the very SOB's that help facilitate the disasters wrought by the Shrub years to his administration. His response was, "these people now work for me".

Well, between the advise they give him, the Party of No and the wish-washy Dem Congress/Senate....it would seem President Obama is deluding himself.

Which leads me to another point of confusion.....given exactly what has come out of the Obama administration thus far, you'd think the neocon driven GOP would be estatic! But instead, they've promised to essentially fuck up Congress until either Obama is out of office or ANY achievements he's made have been destroyed.

Go figure.
 
 
Blago goes to trial and Daly takes over Rahmbo's seat while Rahmbo moves to mayor?

Is this an ironic comedy? Or a nepotistic cabal?

It all reads like a modern variation of "who's on first".

Obama is not progressive. That's a lie and a half.
 
 
More Illinois trash. The man is so predictable.
 
 
 
Decidely awful move.

 

It does reek of cronyism. The same cronyism Bush is often associated with. "Same" being the operative word.
 
 
Our Country is turning into the biggest joke. It's run by money and that's it.
 
 
I guess this is the change you guys were promised.

At what point do you dummies just do a giant facepalm and say WTF ??????????
 
 
At what point do YOU?

Yeah, he is.

You Fabian socialists/progressives can deny him all you want --hell he even denies it himself-- but the deeds speak louder than the rhetoric.

I do, everytime I read your posts.

Moby music making motherfucker.

How come the left can be both anti-Capitalist and pro being in big business' pocket to you, at the same time?

The Government is run Corporately. $$$$$ Dassit, dassall. It's not progressives' faults, it's not Conservatives' faults, it's Greed's fault.
 
 
The Jonas bros called.. they want you back

Because they're pro crony capitalism...There's a difference.

Check out the earlier posted political cartoon from 1911...It's no less true with today's cast of characters than it was back then.
 
 
Right, and Conservative politicians aren't.
 
 
William Daley?

any relation to the crime family from Chicago?
 
 
 
You're corny.

 

Wanna tell him he's white while you're at it?  
 
 
 
Right, and Conservative politicians aren't.

 

But mooooooommmmmmm!...They're doing it toooooooooooo!  

So much for all the hopey-changey thing-a-majig.

It's necessary to point out "they're doing it too" when a person poses arguments against one side and not the other whilst both sides perform the same shilling for Lobbies/Big Corpo/Croneyism....etc. etc.

I mean, good come-back though man. 3.5 on the approach but a 10.0 for the dis-mount.

I'm not posing an argument in favor of so-called "conservatives", fool.

You get a 0.00 for your fallen-flat-on-the-face deflection.
 
 
Bill Daley's as slick as they come.

I remember him as the very first salvo in the 2000 Florida election fiasco. It was mid to late afternoon of election day when all of a sudden Bill and former FL representative Robert Wexler showed up on CNN. Bill, Gore's campaign manager, wasn't liking what he was hearing from the exit polls and, knowing Gore needed FL badly, wanted to try to do something, anything, to somehow try to influence things. So, bingo, he and Wexler cook up the story about the "illegal" butterfly ballot being used in some FL precincts.

My antenna went up immediately. Illegal? As a former Chicagoan I knew full well Daley had voted in Cook County many times using a butterfly ballot. Didn't see any way in hell one could be deemed illegal. It lists various offices and the candidates running for them. And a arrow points from each candidate's name right to the hole you punch to vote for him/her. Nothing could be easier.

And we all know what happened after the "illegal" allegation was laughed off.

Nobody's unsure of the "side" you shill "against" daily.
 
 
Obviously didn't see, or pay much attention to, any of my posts while the last regime was in power, fool.

I did. Your posts were usually anti left anything, and a few shots at Bush's Fiscal irresponsibility sparsed far apart for brevity. Nobody's fool.
 
 
And I never ever called him on his bullshit wars, profligate domestic spending, creation of DHS & TSA, the idiotic Medicare D scam.....

Nope, didn't hear a peep out of me, didja?

Yes, you build up enough anti left bashing and ranting posts to your peak level, giggle at people when they call out Fox news, have more name-calling corny disses for Left-sided politicians........., then blast what the negatives of the Right are at the time for a post or three, and then rinse/repeat. It's alright man.
 
 
Shrubbie was a leftist poorly disguised in an elephant suit, therefore I bashed the hell out of him.

You may now return tho the topic, rather than trying to make this about me and/or playing the "but mooommmm they're doing it toooooo" game.

Fool.

So was George W. Bush and he can't even be considered slightly progressive. It doesn't have anything to do with progressivism at all.
