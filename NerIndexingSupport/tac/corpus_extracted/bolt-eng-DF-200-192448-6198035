 http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7389151.stm 

It seems painfully obvious that Barack Obama will line up against John McCain in November.
(1) it looks like Hillary Clinton's campaign has virtually no money left,
(2) although the latest primary were a 1-1 draw, Obama beat her convincingly in North Carolina, and she only just pipped him in Indiana - meaning she lost ground overall,
(3) despite a number of minor setbacks, Barack Obama can seemingly do no wrong,
(4) the vital super-delegates appear to be rallying more and more behind Obama.

The question is - should Hillary Clinton step aside and have a shred of dignity left over, or should she go on fighting an increasingly un-winnable battle, and hope that Barack Obama makes a major blunder/mistake in the near future?
 
 
She cannot win the popular vote, pledge delegate count, or state tally, even if she wins every single primary left by 100%. The woman is a power hungry ***** and her husband is worse. Think of her as our Cherie Blair.

She has already destroyed the democrats, and I would not be surprised if they dissolved and reorganized, much in the same way the old liberal party mantle was eventually assumed by labour for much of the twentieth century.

I loved her line: "I will keep fighting until we have a candidate".
Yes, dear, you're the only one who's preventing that from happening.

Her problem is she doesn't know how to concede defeat gracefully. She's the sort of person who'll go down kicking and screaming and taking everyone else down with her.
That alone could have been her achilles heel in this process - as president she wouldn't know when to stop fighting a pointless cause.
 
 
Hopefully it will be Obama and McCain in the final vote  
Clinton I'm not too keen on her policies and how she comes across in general.
 
 
Clearly she won't. I think it's about time the remaining superdelegates took matters into their own hands and jumped on Barack Obama. Send the message that Obama and the Democrats are going to the White House with or without Hillary Clinton. After all, Clinton's continued presence in the race has not enabled the Democrats to display unity and focus for a single purpose, and this is something the Democrats need to rectify immediately.
 
 
The whole process, as far as I can see, is simply damaging both candidates and the party. It's raising their profiles, but there's a hell of a lot of mudslinging.

But let's say I was put in her position, and had just been struck over the head with a cricket bat and thus had similar thought processes, I'd probably do the same and hold on. Fight to the end and all that.
 
 
I say let her continue, but that's mainly because I'm not keen on either of them.

But to be perfectly honest there is no reason why she should have to step down. What's the point of having a voting procedure if you're going to expect one of the candidates to give up before the final votes have been cast, let alone counted.

The real issue here is how ******ed the campaign thing is that it takes so extraordinarily long just to decide on who is going to campaign. Stupid and self damaging for the Democrats. They spend all this time fighting each other and have far less time and energy to fight the real fight. Stupid, stupid, stupid. Good  
 
 
yes.

what, you wanted more?
 
 
It's an observation that has been bounded about quite a lot but the voters who voted for Clinton in the primaries are less likely to vote for Obama than the other way around with more Obama voters willing to vote Clinton than not. This Obama craze proves that the modern style of politics which promotes style over substance is alive and kicking and will quite likely result in a Democratic loss in November - a narrow one I think but a loss nonetheless. As it stands we have Obama who, like Cameron, just has a slogan. 'Change we can all believe in' is an accurate appraisal of a campaign that is simply about the hype around a word and a man. Alas Clinton, for all her faults, has at least put out there her vision particularly with regards to healthcare.

But if she's not going to win (which most people now realise is true - even Bill) why is she still in it? She's just damaging her own party and the Democrats chances of beating McCain.

The Democrats have a fair way of selecting a candidate but its major flaw is when you have two equally matched candidates - at which point it becomes TOO fair.

The Republican process is so much more effective.
 
 
Yes she should give up

but will she give up....... NO this is because she still thinks that it is possible for her to win the nomination, she doesnt mind if it damages Obama chances all she cares about is herself

Well, if she couldn't win, then the race would be over. But the fact is she could still win so she has no reason to stop. And let's face it, if she loses why should she care that she did great damage to the party. It's not like she's going to get anything from them anyway.

It's not just a question of FPTP vs PR, it is also the length of time over which the voting is spread. It's been, what, 3 months since the first vote was cast? That is a stupid system.
 
 
I have just got back from New England, and the support I saw there was mainly for Clinton. So I am suprised at this thread.

New England doesn't elect a president of the USA.
 
 
Probably should but I hope she doesn't.

Her campaign has been bravely fought and it is only thanks to this campaign that Obama has received any scrutiny at all. I think she should continue fighting in the hope that Obama, complete tool that he is, puts his foot in his mouth again or another ugly skeleton leaps from his closet.

funniest thing I read all day. Yes, if by bravely you mean dirtily.
 
 
^ Well, Obama's hasn't exactly been squeaky clean either.

Whether she gives up or not, the damage is still done. There's a clear division in the democratic party because of all this somewhat vicious campaigning of both obama and hillary, and whoever is the democratic candidate isn't going to have the whole of the party backing them. That division will probably affect the actual presidential election, and no way do we (well, I) want a republican in office this time round.

Personally, I don't like obama. Hillary is marginally better.
 
 
I don't like either of them but for the good of her party, she probably should concede. Whoever wins, they'll be knackered by the time the real contest begins!

A vote for McCain is essentially a third term of Bush. Nobody needs that. Not America. Not the rest of the world.

Yeah, exactly. Bush is endorsing McCain.

again? when did he screw up the first time?
 
 
It's gone this far, might as well let her play till the end of the primaries - then she can never argue that she didn't have a full opportunity. Plus she can still win the nomination, and can still win the general election. I support Obama but I think him being the nominee now and him being the nominee in a months time will not be the sole reason why he wins/looses in the winter (if he does become the nominee).
 
 
Louis Farrakhan endorses Obama, ergo Obama is exactly like Farrakhan. Of course Bush supports McCain, they're Republicans and he is the presumptive nominee. The policies of McCain, although sometimes hawkish actually differ from Bush's a lot, and he has been quite critical of Bush's policies. In fact they ran against each other in 2000 i believe.
 
 
Surely if she stays on, it'll just damage Obama and the party even more. What's so ironic is that she has no chance of winning! No chance what so ever! What is she doing wasting her own money on a meaningless campaign?

Democrats should endorse Obama so the general election campaigns can properly begin.

What?! Have you seen McCain's policies? Just because he's a Republican doesn't mean he's a Bush. He's been touted as the most 'liberal' Republican candidate for decades; he believes in global warming for a start, and he's more seemingly pro-choice.

The US party system is not the UK party system. Their ideologies are far more widespread within the party, rather than between the parties. Just look at the Reagan Democrats for example.

Any of the three candidates will be far better than Bush. Obama seems likely to take the Democrat nomination, but McCain might appeal to some Democrats and independents, even if he won't get the American Right's support (although Dobson, leader of Focus on the Family, did endorse him!) to anywhere near the degree Bush got it. I hope for Obama and expect McCain.

In regards to Clinton, the Florida/Michigan delegates could potentially alter things quite a bit. However it seems far too late for them to get seated now, and the lack of legitimacy (especially with Obama not on the ballot in Michigan) would make it laughable without a real re-election. She'll lose it, eventually, unless she can make a huge leap on superdelegate support. But whether that'll be soon enough to unite the Democrats is seeming less and less likely.
 
 
Good post Chronos, I'm the opposite however. Hope for McCain, expect Obama (Hiss!).

Correct, and McCain did well in the open primaries (where independents/Democrats can vote), which bodes well for him in 2008. But Bush will have done a lot of damage to any Republican candidate's chances.
 
 
NO!!!! Hillz will never give up- she's a fighter and she's gonna win.

McCain and Bush actually pretty much hated each other in 2000. McCain was critical of a lot of Bush's policies, but then for some reason changed his mind on a lot of them. Bush's endorsement of McCain is a reluctant one, if anything only because they both have similar foreign policies and McCain is a republican.

Hillary should quit, she can't win so all she is doing is damaging the party. At least the split between people who go for McCain's policies and Obama's will be a lot clearer, seeing as Hillary has used republican like attack ads against Obama.

If the democrats lose this election, then I don't think they deserve to be allowed to take part in the next election. This is so set up for them, and yet everyone knows that SOMEHOW they are going to ******* it up.
 
 
It will be fascinating seeing how McCain and Obama go at each other, especially given the 25 year age gap.
It's also going to be interesting seeing if McCain gets some of the Democrat votes because of his more liberal stance, and whether Obama can urge Clinton supporters to vote for him rather than deserting him.
 
 
Maybe she is trying to make Obama lose so she can run in 2012.. haha ruthless.

McCain is only more liberal on a few domestic issues. His stances on several other issues are far from liberal.
 
 
shoudl hilary clinton give up? DEFINITELY NO!
or if she does, i'm supporting John McCain. go republicans!

When he showed his ignorance (and elitism) by talking about small town citizens as bitter people clinging to guns and religion for a start.

Well, he's hardly going to endorse anybody else is he? "I'm George Dubya Bush and I'm endorsing Hilary Clinton as Democratic Nominee and President of the United States of America"

the only reason why most people think that didn't happen almost immediately on wednesday is because the superdelagates are choosing to be sensitive to her Achilles heel. it certainly isn't wise of them to offend her now when she has managed to rally several demographic groups to her cause that are important to the NDP (national democratic party). the trick will be to keep her happy until she does step down, so she doesn't feel like a loser. the letdown must be gentle enough not to offend her main supporters and thus encourage them to either not vote in november, or vote for McCain.

Seriously ??? Even republicans must be looking back on the last 8 years and realised they ****** this up badly. George Bush has destroyed the republican party and everything it stood for.
 
 
Yeah, she shouldn't give up. Realistically, she probably can't win, but there's still a chance. If she did win, she'd be a way better president. She's had more political experience than obama. Plus she can always ask her husband for advice  , and he was a good president (albeit an unfaithful husband).
 
 
PLEASE giVE Up hillary!! if the Democrats lose, its all her fault!

they will be seated, there's a meeting on May 31st to discuss reelection options, or merely whether the delegates should just be split between Clinton and Obama.

Clinton won't make a huge leap with the superdelegates without the popular vote, it would split the party to give the nomination to a candidate who didn't hold the popular vote.

either way, both speeches on tuesday did much to begin the reconciliation process i believe. the tension was palpably lessened between the (rare) Clinton supporters and Obama supporters on campus on Wednesday.
 
 
Although I'd rather see Clinton in the White House than Obama, I think Clinton should step aside for the sake of the party. As Obama said earlier: We should unite to prevent McCain executing George Bush's third term.
 
 
For anyone interest Jon Stewart on The Daily Show (amazing program) interviewed Howard Dean, head of the DNC. You can see Dean crumble as Stewart points out the stupid Democratic nominee system (with superdelegates).

 http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/in...le=howard-dean 

Also Dean says they are trying to seat Florida and Michigan at the convention.
 
 
She should give up. She's ****ing up the whole democratic nomination!

definitely agree with you there, george bush was prob one of the worst republican. he just ashamed the party. he ****ed up the economy and the world by going to war with iraq (although i must admit i wasn't surprised there, as it was bond to happen soon or later because they have more crude oil and blah blah blah). however it's not just america that this is affecting, it also affects other countries such as the UK. stupid bush.

I would disagree with the political experience comment. She seems to be uttering this line of 35 years of experience, when i've only counted 8.....being married to someone, in my opinion, does not count for experience. and as far as bill's concerned, i think his hayday is over. when he showed up to my campus to give us a rallying speech he was drunk  

obama's talent for bringing people together is what america really needs right now....we are a country of countless divides, and i think as a president he could do much to heal them.
 
 
yes she should, as said she has no way of winning the nomination now - if she really does have any 'love' for the democratic party (which she raves on about on many occasions) she should just step down from the race and save face herself

i mean $6m more in her own money towards funding - give it up hillary

Guys I'm not an expert on the whole US scene having not really followed,.Although I do support Clinton because she does have 16 years of experience opposed to Obama's 4. So what I gotta ask is, what's Obama's policy,objectives,credentials etc. Does he have anything besides what I have mainly heard which is 'Hope,Change,Great orator'

er yes. he was a community organizer in inner city chicago, which should count as experience   he was also a professor of constitutional law, which the president is supposed to protect.  

if i were you, i would take some initiative and look at his website:

cheers! and happy policy discovery.

Sixteen years of experience as what exactly? You can't count being POTUS' wife as experience.

Well, she was actually an advisor for the House Committee on the Judiciary prior to 1974, ironically, about impeachment. I'd count that as political experience. At that time, Obama was still in high school. And also, as first lady, during which time she worked in law, and in family policy, she would have been exposed to more political events than Obama, who was a lawyer for several years, and wasn't sworn into office till 2005 (according to his website).

I'm not saying Hillary's perfect. I do have criticisms, especially about her sitting on corporate boards, and supporting big corporations, who frankly, I think are ruining the world (but that's another argument lol). As for Bill, clearly he has womanizing and alcohol issues, but as president, he came closer than a lot of US presidents (especially the Bushes) to gaining some headway with issues in the middle east. And he left office with the highest approval rating that any US president has left with.

When you say divides, you mean...racial issues? Domestic policies? Btw, thanks for the rep

Look. Obama has done remarkably little in his life. I've read his background and was astounded by how little he has actually done. A community organizer in inner city Chicago is hardly a fine training ground for being Commander-in-Chief and leader of the world's most powerful nation.

However, in fairness, all this talk of "experience" is a load of crap anyway. There have been dozens of US Presidents who have come into office without any congressional experience at all. Some were Generals, others only had experience as governors and one or two only had a few years as state legislators under their belts.

agreed. experience certainly isn't, in my opinion, necessary. presidents have countless advisors to assist them in policy decisions etc. so really, what one needs, is good people skills, a level head, etc.

Exactly. And experience is no guarantee of success anyway. Look at Gordon Brown - years and years in Parliament, 10 years as Chancellor, and still a complete disaster in the top job. A good foot soldier or lieutenant isn't necessarily going to make a good General however many years experience he may have.

fair enough. although i refuse to count first lady experience as something that should be put on her resume.   i also highly disagree with her opinion that, "lobbyists represent all of the different facets of america.."

and by obama bringing people together, i mean on racial issues, age issues, domestic policy.....everything really.

he's an amazing speaker. i went to see him when he came to our campus in New Orleans, and i've never felt as part of the community as i did then. jazz muscians from the 9th ward and musicians village were there, black teachers from inner city schools, schoolchildren, college students, the white upper class, the black lower class. everyone was listening raptly and cheering him on. his message is a mixture of both roosevelt and kennedy and really does a number for one's morale. believe that you can change your life, but demand a government that is willing to help you get to the point where you can succeed.

bringing people together in new orleans is a huge feat, and just looking at the age, social, and economic differences of all of these people who had come together to root for him sent shivers down my spine.

Oh for the love of.... Republican policies are still VERY much supported by vast swathes of the States, its merely the man in the Oval Office they no longer support. Parties are not THAT important either, the GOP has NOT been destroyed at all and is as strong as ever, its simply Bush that the public lament.

he's an amazing speaker. i went to see him when he came to our campus in New Orleans, and i've never felt as part of the community as i did then. jazz muscians from the 9th ward and musicians village were there, black teachers from inner city schools, schoolchildren, college students, the white upper class, the black lower class. everyone was listening raptly and cheering him on. his message is a mixture of both roosevelt and kennedy and really does a number for one's morale. believe that you can change your life, but demand a government that is willing to help you get to the point where you can succeed.

bringing people together in new orleans is a huge feat, and just looking at the age, social, and economic differences of all of these people who had come together to root for him sent shivers down my spine.

 

He is a viable candidate...and it's good that he was able to bring the new orleans community together  .

It's just that hillary is still in the race, and still winning primaries which outlines that he might not be able to bring the people together. 50% or slightly less of democrats are still voting for hillary.

Although we've had our differences on another thread, I must side with ssk2 here.
President Bush will not go down as America's greatest president, but it won't affect John McCain's chances just because they represent the same party.

Indeed. Most Americans are really looking forward to another 4 years of war in Iraq while the country is bled dry. It doesn't matter much whose leading the charge (of the Light Brigade) just so long as we get to spend another couple hundred billion and see a few thousand more US military deaths.

I think I speak for the whole country when I say we look forward to seeing more of Bush's very successful domestic policies continued as well. No child left behind has been a resounding success and keeping the numbers of uninsured slightly beneath the 55 million mark is to be applauded.

Whilst you're of course correct about the 'still retaining vast swathes of support', it's inaccurate to say that Bush hasn't at least done some damage to the GOP as a whole. Although whether that's directly Bush, or the result of the 107-109th 'Do Nothing' is debatable. The lower Congressional approval ratings of the GOP vs. the Democrats would support the idea that they have been reduced in support since the days of Gingrich.

But it kinda show you how much she does want to be a president doesnt it?Her continued fight? And to be fair, with the Democrats split quite closely down the middle, I do find her statement that she will consider Obama as her vice IF she wins quite good, as opposed to Obama not really giving it serious thought of Clinton. I mean with neither being able to get a clear majority of Democrats, I'm sure for the interest of the party they will love a dream team combo

you know, what i think is important to remember is that in most states, only democrats vote. yes, the vote is somewhat split, great! that hardly makes clinton more viable than obama. what it means is, obama has problems with traditionally racist demographic groups, ie: Reagan Democrats. (democrats who aren't so into social issues as they are continuing welfare, protecting jobs, etc.) what i think is important to look at here is that obama won't be running against a fellow democrat in the fall. he'll be running against a conservative, one with radically different economic policies than clinton. i expect that the democratic party will unite behind obama because people are able to recognize that he won the popular vote fair and square. on the other hand, if clinton gets the nomination through superdelagates there is a potential uproar within the party because most will see it as not having won fair and square.

and on clinton's electability...i think she has far less than she thinks. this poll is a bit old, but shoes that something like 48% of the country wouldn't even consider voting for her....

not a good start. =/

OK, that makes sense. And the views (and generally education level) of the typical New Englander are different from that of a typical American from somewhere else?

But I have also heard that Obama is very popular with younger people, and the older ones often tend to think that Clinton is more suitable as she has had more experience? And Obama could be elected later on in his career? Is this right?

okay
a. no, the general education (that is, primary and secondary) are very similar across all US states. slightly more people go to university in new england, than say, the south. the views of the american people tend to vary wildly between towns. the south tends to be dixie-crat and republican, midwest republican, new england liberal, west coast liberal. the rust belt tends to swing depending on the election year and the economy.

that is to say, in summary, there is no one "typical" american. due to vast geographic ranges there are several "typical" americans that can be typecast to represent their various regions. of course, this "typical" american would change with class and color.....for instance a white upper-class typical southerner would be very different from a black lower-class typical southerner.

b. obama is popular with the young, the educated white upper class, and the african american communities.

hillary clinton is popular amoungst seniors (who are more likely to be racist) and uneducated whites (who are more likely to be racist) and hispanics (who don't really like african americans) <- anyone who knows anything about american gang war will support that comment.

"experience" is her shout line....but apparently not a whole lot of voters think it's as important as the fact that obama is black.

c. obama could be elected later, yes. so could clinton.
 
 
She has next to no chance of winning. So yes.

Does anyone find it weird that we tend to say that Clinton gets the racist vote? The uneducated and senior whites who are 'supposedly racist'. But then doesn't Obama get all the african-american votes. People who are voting for him because he is like them, because he is well african-american. Isn't that racist as well? Doesn't Obama also get a racist vote? Or has the definition of racist been changed so much it now means only when the whites dislike the blacks and not when the blacks dislike the whites?

well see, the thing is, on exit polls african americans are not citing race to be an issue when choosing to vote for obama. white people are. if you will remember (i don't know, you're english and they may not have covered the race this early) but last year (2007) on bloody sunday both hillary and obama spoke in selma....clinton at the time drew significantly larger black crowds, while obama merely had a small gathering.

in the beginning, the african americans were largely for clinton. why did that change? because she abandoned their economic and social concerns and instead decided to fill her constituency with well, uneducated whites. *shrug*

She didn't abandon their economic and social concerns. They abandoned her.

Indiana - 90 percent of blacks voted Obama
Pennsylvania - 93 percent of blacks voted Obama
North Carolina - 91 percent of blacks voted Obama

When 93% of blacks are voting for Obama, it's not just his "policies" (which are identical to Clinton's). It's pure racism, nothing more, no matter what they are saying in the exit polls.
 
 
I don't think she should give up.
 According to this site, which I believe is pretty accurate, if the election were held today, Obama would lose to McCain, 254 to 273. There is a tie for 11 electoral votes, but even if they go to Obama, he still loses. 

 Hillary Clinton, if the election was held today and polling data is accurate, would actually beat McCain, mostly because she could take Florida and get its 27 electoral votes. This same site has her beating McCain, 280 to 258 electoral votes.

You might have a point if they had gone from 51% to 49% as a result of something she said that was offensive. But when 93% of blacks are block voting for Obama, you can't with a straight face say race hasn't got anything to do with it.

Steward is an idiot. The Geneva Convention was meant to regulate international warfare between states and had provisions for civil wars as well. It is completely irrelevant when dealing with terrorists. And what the hell was Howard Dean on about? Republicans don't use the constitution and have 25 rich guys pick a candidate? What planet is he living on? It's amazing that this man was almost the nominee in 2004.

eh, black voters have a lot to be extremely sensitive about....you start pulling the i want the whites race card, and naturally they feel resentful. more so than whites would, because whites haven't been oppressed for hundreds of years. so yes, when one candidate starts to try to appeal solely to working class whites, and anouther (even black! +++) says things like, let's all come together, you're going to get some significant block voting.
 
 
totally in agreement with made in the USA

obama has increased his point margin between blacks i believe from 60 earlier on in the primaries to more than 80 now - this can hardly be attributed to policy as they have virtually the same (and small differences in the ones they differ on)

race is the issue here but anyone who believed that it would not in idiot imo

"I have a much broader base to build a winning coalition on," she said in an interview with USA TODAY. As evidence, Clinton cited an Associated Press article "that found how Sen. Obama's support among working, hard-working Americans, white Americans, is weakening again, and how whites in both states who had not completed college were supporting me."

 http://www.democracyfornewmexico.com...n-working.html 

that's the link.
 
 
this is one of my favourite comments from the article:

Mike Barnicle makes it even plainer by writing:

Now, faced with a mathematical mountain climb that even Stephen Hawking could not ascend, the Clintons -- and it is indeed both of them -- are just about to paste a bumper sticker on the rear of the collapsing vehicle that carries her campaign. It reads: VOTE WHITE.

anouther good insight:

Instead, Hillary seems to be resorting to the worst kind of racial politics, basically framing African-American voters as unnecessary to her cause and lumping them all together into one homogeneous, problematic demographic viewed as The Blacks. This is something we might expect from certain Klan-friendly Republicans, but from someone who claims to represent the Democratic Party mainstream.

you're right, it can't be attributed solely to policy. it can be attributed, however, to speaking styles, aims, and what each candidate presents him/herself as.

clinton: clearly wants the white vote.

obama: clearly wants the everyone vote. he wants to bring people together not stick them into demographic groups with labeling stickers, and has certainly never hinted to black voters that they aren't hardworking because they aren't white!

and as for doing my research: my brother works on the obama campaign, so we have election news on our TV about 24 hours a day, and when we aren't watching the news, and he isn't out campaigning, we're scanning conservative and liberal political blogs for news.

so really, i doubt you could be better informed than me, seeing as you're in london, and you seem to have a fuzzy understanding of the campaign at best.  
 
 
Its unfortunate that the Democrats have their own system of awarding delegates on a proportional basis rather than having a 'winner-takes-all' approach like the Republicans. There are certain states that Dems need to win in order to beat McCain in November; and it is true to say that a lot of those states will be swaying more towards McCain rather than Obama in November because Billary isn't the Dem's nominee.

Having said that, I don't like Billary one bit and I can't understand what so many voters see in her. She is just a power-hungry politician that isn't interested in doing the right things for the right reasons. Her approach to these Primaries and Causcuses wasn't as good as it should have been, however. She went in expecting to have the nomination locked-up by Super-Tuesday. She wasn't prepared for Obama to win more states that early and she wasn't ready to continue fighting in those Ten important states after Super-Tuesday which has given Obama that 100+ lead in the pledged delegates.

Anything now will be too little too late. RE: her campaign to have the Michigan and Florida delegates seated at the Convention. This is a noble campaign but not many people can, hand on heart, say that Billary would have wanted this if she had lost these states. As it stands, its a reasonable solution to say that: rules are rules; Obama wasn't the only Dem candidate that was still in the race at the time that didn't campaign in those states. Billary did so at her own peril.

Of course, the important point is that both Florida and Michigan are important states in the General Election carrying a lot of Electoral Votes. They are both likely to be pissed off with the Dems, enough to vote Republican instead. This is another reason why the Dems will lose in November: because they're throwing big states and lots of electoral votes out of the window.

oh your 'brother' does, does he? to add on, clearly your not biased are you then? you are looking at this objectively? hahaha  

just b/c one does not live in the usa does not mean one cannot have a close following and understanding of the election

my latter comment i think was aimed at our confusion, i misunderstood what you meant by that statement - i know clinton has been using the 'white' card so to speak for her campaign but to put this down to her loosing the black votes is naive at best

really? then you probably haven't lived in a heavily black community then have you? as a new orleanian i am in constant contact with a vibrant african american community (new orleans is 70% black) and trust me, they didn't take to kindly to clinton's statements.  

i love how you think you can understand american racial lines without having lived it. brilliant, really.

oh, and yes, my brother nolan does work for obama's campaign. he also has an internship to work on an election campaign in Minneapolis this summer for a democratic hopeful. he also is a delegate for obama for the texas democratic convention, which will then send delegates to the national convention in august. i have no idea what that seems hard to believe.

a lot of what you say is true. and the DNC will be seating Florida and Michigan at the convention, Howard Dean said so on MSNBC on tuesday afternoon. (Howard Dean is the DNC chairman)

there will very likely be a revote, with both obama and clinton on both state's ballots. (obama wasn't on florida's ballot)

as far as michigan and florida being big states, they are, it's true. however, it's good to keep in mind that much of hillary's constituency are faithful democrats, and will probably go to obama's side when hillary finally gives up, especially because of the grace with which obama has handled himself this week.

hillary is only doing the party a disservice by keeping in the election for west virginia, kentucky, montana, oregon, and puerto rico....but she doesn't care much about party strength....the powerhungry little ****.
 
 
 
as a new orleanian i am in constant contact with a vibrant african american community (new orleans is 70% black) and trust me, they didn't take to kindly to clinton's statements.  
 

oh yes i forgot that new orleans speaks for every member of the black community in the USA - silly me i guess

oh really! thats excellent as my sister has moved to the USA when the nomination campaign started and she is now co-head organiser of her campaign - her name is sasha

she said that black people don't think like that about clinton so i don't know really :/

so then back to the original point, so i'm guessing as your 'brother' happens to run in the camp for obama and hence your close ties to it, your not biased then? - idiot if i ever saw one

so then back to the or

 

I like you.

Yeah to further your point(to the poster you are contradicting) you are claiming expertise when you have absolutely no right to. It doesn't take a US citizen to extrapolate why 93% of blacks are voting for Obama. It really doesn't.
 
 
Is Billary really doing the party a disservice by staying in the race? perhaps

Will she be doing herself a disservice if she leaves the race? Yes. It is conceivable that she could still be the nominee - she has a case to make (much as I don't want to hear it).

On the Republican side, Huckabee didn't leave the race until it became mathematically impossible for him to win. Ron Paul, I think, is still in the race; although I don't know why, but he seems to think, McCain isn't going to be the nominee after the Reublican party convention. Huckabee, like Clinton, had an important case to make - and a lot of people in the Republican party were listening to him. However, he was never never going to be the nominee. Therefore, he shouldn't have stayed in the race until so late. I think when you compare Clinton to Huckabee, there are a lot of reasons, valid ones, why she should still stay in the race. What if Obama has another controversial crisis? What if he is so damaged by it that an attempt against McCain in November would be redundant and would lead to McCain landslide. Its the last thing the Democrats need.

I think Billary should stay in the race. I think Obama should profit from her goodwill in important states like Florida, Californina, New York, Ohio and Texas by choosing her as his running-mate. Let her do the donkey work; let him be President. Its possibly the only way he can beat McCain: he'll win over a lot of Clinton supporters, a lot of Reagan Democrats, a lot of black voters, a lot of female voters and a tonne of electoral votes from the aforementioned big states. I haven't recognised this in the past, but I really think that they will be an unstoppable force against McCain in the general, if that's the ticket.

If it isn't going to be Clinton as his running-mate, it really needs to be the next best thing. If he loses against McCain, his chances of running again are very minimum. He will have pissed a lot of people off - and they'd be wondering: would Clinton have beaten McCain. Of course, this is all vice versa to.

I don't really like Howard Dean, but I won't say Stewart is an idiot. I think he and Stephen Colbert have done a great job over the last few years. Then again I suppose you have to watch their shows regularly to appreciate it.

As for Dean's 25 richest guys comment, I think he is talking about the republican nominee system not having proportional representation etc. so it's less democratic. Other than that I'm not really sure what he's going on about :|.

She said that a couple of days ago and it's the first time she has ever discussed demographics. Blacks deserted her LONG before she ever made those comments. And it's a real stretch to say she is alienating blacks by stating the obvious and pointing out which groups are voting for her and which groups aren't. Honestly, I've never seen the left wing traditional media resort to such underhanded tactics. The mainstream media has always been biased, but it's always been a subtle, under-the-the-radar kind of bias. This attempt to paint everyone running against Obama as racist is very dangerous and their pro-Obama bias is very bad for democracy. Does anyone else have a problem with the media chooing the candidate for the American people? I can't believe I'm defending Hillary Clinton, since I don't like her policies, but this is completely ridiculous.

As for Dean's 25 richest guys comment, I think he is talking about the republican nominee system not having proportional representation etc. so it's less democratic. Other than that I'm not really sure what he's going on about :|.

 

The republicans have a better system. They don't have "super delegates", which is extremely elitist. Super delegates are a group of elites who can disregard the will of the people and select any candidate they want. How is that democratic?

EDIT: One more thing, as president, Ronald Reagan rejected efforts to expand the Geneva Conventions to cover terrorists. Is it asking too much to expect Stewart to be informed on such matters?

The Republican unpledged RNC members aren't that dissimilar to superdelegates really. They can, as you say, 'disregard the will of the people and select any candidate they want'.

There needs to be a system in place to break a tie when necessary, but I don't think they are in any way comparable systems. The 800+ “super-delegates” comprise nearly 40 percent of the number of delegates needed to get the Democratic nomination. That's a lot of power in the hands of the elite.

I concur, but to say the Republicans don't have them at all is a tad misleading.

All this talk about the super delegates made me think of something else. I think the mainstream media is terrified of seeing things go any further. They want Obama to be the nominee and win the election. Something like 1% separates Obama and Clinton. In a race that close, no matter who the the elites chose, 50% of the democrats are going to be livid. I've seen polls that say that half of Clinton supporters won't even consider voting for Obama and many Obama supporters are saying they will be so angry they will vote for McCain also if they don't have their way. I'm not sure how much of this is BS, but it does seem like the democrats may have a serious problem uniting the party when the dust settles.

This is why the media has been pushing Clinton to drop out of the race. If she concedes now and throws her support behind Obama, the super delegates can award him the numbers he needs to be the nominee and won't have a chaotic situation on their hands. Since neither of them have the delegates they need, it has to come down to the elites and 50% of the democrats are going to feel like their candidate was selected illegitimately.

Honestly, I've never seen the left wing traditional media resort to such underhanded tactics. The mainstream media has always been biased, but it's always been a subtle, under-the-the-radar kind of bias. This attempt to paint everyone running against Obama as racist is very dangerous and their pro-Obama bias is very bad for democracy. Does anyone else have a problem with the media chooing the candidate for the American people? I can't believe I'm defending Hillary Clinton, since I don't like her policies, but this is completely ridiculous.

 

well, who do you think choose kerry?

i was merely making the point that black voters, in my city, tend to have the same concerns as black voters across the south. culturally you will find that african american communities are very similar across the united states. this especially is supported by the lack of more than one dialect of english that african americans use. (that is, if there was more than one, you would have a substantial argument for cultural differences across america)

so then back to the original point, so i'm guessing as your 'brother' happens to run in the camp for obama and hence your close ties to it, your not biased then? - idiot if i ever saw one

 

ah, and which campaign is that? good for her, sasha is a lovely name. somehow i think your middle point is sarcasm...but then i'm american, so what could i know about that?  

i'm an obama supporter of my own right. i gave billary a chance until i saw hillary speak at my school, and really, she's lacking the crucial leadership qualities that make obama so special. that is, the ability to bring people together.

i think obama supporters would have the right to claim that hillary was selected illegitimately, but clinton? i think most supporters of clinton will at least be able to realize that obama has won fair and square.

i think you're underestimating the support that's still out there for hillary. the media have always put her down, saying that she couldn't win certain states etc. but she's always proved them wrong, up to now anyway. i genuinely think that she could still pull it off and i def believe, along with many others, that she'd be the strongest candidate against mccain.

Do you really think when push comes to shove, that obama- or clinton-ites will not vote for the democrat candidate out of spite?

seeing as i once declared i would move to canada if hillary won.....yes.

i am, of course, moving to canada regardless, i'll just merely cast my ballot for mccain if hillary wins. the last thing we need is anouther four years of the clintons.

****ing lobbyist supporters...

52% of the US, when surveyed, said they wouldn't consider voting for clinton. and while this poll is older, it also showcases the time when hillary was the most popular, so i think it's fair to use...

 hils electability numbers 

and a newer one, taken about three weeks ago:

 second poll

Whilst I definitely not in favour of Clinton, would you not vote for her over McCain? I know I would.

I know tensions are pretty high right now, but I imagine which ever nominee wins will try and swing behind the other for the sake of the party.

And then there's also the possibility of VPs...

eh, i don't think obama will choose her as a VP. (of course i may be wrong)

but i don't think, even if she were offered it, she would take it.

and of course, there was the comment from senator kennedy yesterday that basically said to obama not to take the pressure from the media to pick clinton as his second in command. that can be found here:  senator kennedy's two cents

well, you know, if clinton wins the nomination, it will be only because of superdelegates. i have no wish to support a party that doesn't do what the people want....and casting my ballot for hillary would indeed do that. so no, i wouldn't vote for her.

I'm looking at both sides of the coin. I'm sure Clintonites will still vote democrat if Obama wins (looking increasingly likely).

Why is it so hard to believe that many democrats will vote for McCain? In this country, people vote for the person, not the party, and McCain is the same as Hillary and Obama on many issues. He has bought into the global warming farce, he doesn't want to allow torture even in a "ticking time bomb" situation, he supports open borders and amnesty, wants to close Guantanamo, and he opposes ANWR.

Lets assume that half of them are full of crap and vote for the democrat candidate they didn't support. The other half will cross party lines and vote for McCain. That still is a serious problem for the democrats.
 
 
Like it was said, when 93 percent of the blacks support Obama,it's not just policies involve. So saying that only Clinton get's the racist vote is totally bias against her.

I won't say who Clinton-ites or Obama-ites will vote for in the end,but if McCain has the same policies as them, then they might vote for who they feel will lead the party best in the future. And despit, the comments about Hillary speech lacking leadership, really I always though action speaks louder than words. Let's compare Clinton's 16 years (Yes her First Lady years do count because she did initiate policies then) and Obama's 4 years and see where leadership lies.

As fir super-delegates, why some feel they should vote for those who people want, I think that they should vote for who they feel will win McCain. What's the point of giving it to Obama if he's gonna lose to McCain as the polls say

Polls have Obama being more popular, but McCain winning more states. We know what that means.

Bearing in mind that McCain hasn't even started campaigning or getting his face out yet, I'd say he's doing pretty well....

Bearing in mind Obama's had all the mud slung at him recently and he's still raising in the polls, I'd say he's doing pretty well too.....

Not to mention Obama hasn't started campaigning for president yet either.

If Michigan and Florida don't count, two of the most crucial states, then how could Obama ever be seen as legitimate? How could that ever be fair and square?

And that makes a difference because... Obama and Hillary are getting valuable tv time and getting their faces out and their policies heard. McCain on the other hand has not had the opportunity to do so, yet.

I guess all publicity is good publicity, despite all the Pastor/Bittergate comments.

But McCain is campaigning as we speak. If people are taking little notice of him, that's his fault. The democrat nominee will turn their campaigning machine against McCain soon enough, don't you worry...

I would think that when the Democrat nominee is chosen (s)he will be destroyed by the Republican propaganda machine. I'll put money on it "anonymous sources" will say stuff about the candidate. Bad stuff.
 
 
Yes she should if she really does support the party.

I agree. If Obama supporters really believe he is the legitimate candidate, let these 2 states votes count. How can he be the USA Democrat choice, when the whole USA didnt get thier voices heard? And forgot all the illegal stuff? If it was so bad, cancel those results and have a new election there, right now
 
 
I think she should continue as best as she can. I would really like to see her win the Democrat race and win the Election in November.

I think Obama plays on the "being black" thing too much, I have nothing against different races/ethnicities but I just think Obama is sly with what he is doing.

There's just something about Obama I don't like either, I so much prefer Hillary, she's had experience being around her husband and I think she will be able to do a good job.

But, being British I have no say in this matter and just hope that at least a Democrat gets into the white house as I dislike Republicans.

hillary definitely plays up being a woman. and that white voters love her because they're white!

i hate hillary, i hate lobbyists, and if hillary wins, i'm moving to canada.

but for real this time
