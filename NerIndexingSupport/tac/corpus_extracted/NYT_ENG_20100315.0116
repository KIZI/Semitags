      The last wild wolverine in the Wolverine State is dead.

State environmental officials say the 28-pound female was found
Saturday in the Thumb's Minden City State Game Area. Hikers
discovered her body in a creek.

The animal is believed to have died of natural causes, said Mary
Dettloff, spokeswoman for the Department of Natural Resources and
Environment.

A necropsy will be performed, she said.

It's been centuries since wolverines made their home in the
state, and DNRE officials suspect this one may have been imported
-- possibly from Canada -- and released.

"The last one in Michigan in the wild was probably 200 years
ago," Dettloff said.

When first spotted in 2004, the wolverine caused a stir, and
wildlife officials tried to protect it from the public.

"She's a pretty unique animal for the state," said
conservation officer Seth Rhodea. "It's pretty sad to see her
go."

Decker High School chemistry teacher Jeff Ford came face-to-face
with the animal when he visited a game area this winter .

"I was trying to stay still and be quiet, but I was having a
hard time because I was breathing heavily and shaking," he said.
