An Australian wine maker scooped a series of awards at an international
competition, Australian Associated Press reported on Tuesday.

Taylors Wines, of South Australia's Clare Valley, was awarded four gold medals
at the 2010 Concours Mondial de Bruxelles, an elite show which has been labeled
as the wine world championship.

Mitchell Taylor, third-generation managing director of Taylors Wines, said the
recognition reinforced Australia's ability to make world-class wines.

"I couldn't be happier with these results," Taylor said in a statement.

"Awards like these help show the world that Australia continues to produce
excellent wines."

The judging panel has made up international wine experts from 40 different
countries.

The winning varieties span three different Taylors ranges, all of which are
currently available in Australia.

They included the 2008 Taylors Shiraz, 2008 Jaraman Chardonnay, 2005 St Andrews
Cabernet Sauvignon and 2005 St Andrews Riesling.
