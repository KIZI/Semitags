The International Criminal Court said Wednesday it has given the green light for
a full-scale probe by its prosecutor of the deadly violence that followed
Kenya's 2007 presidential election.

"The chamber, by majority, hereby authorises the commencement of an
investigation into the situation in the Republic of Kenya in relation to crimes
against humanity," the court said in a written decision.
