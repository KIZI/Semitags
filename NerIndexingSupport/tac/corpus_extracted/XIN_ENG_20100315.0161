Defense Minister of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo) Charles Mwando
Nsimba and his Belgian counterpart Pieter De Grem signed a protocol  here on
Sunday for cooperation between the Belgian army and DR Congo's Armed Forces
(FARDC).

"According to the protocol, the Belgian army will help reinforce the capacities
of FARDC and this includes the training of a FARDC battalion at Kindu in
Maniema. This battalion has been trained by the Belgians," the Belgian defense
chief said after signing the document.

On Monday, the Belgian minister is to visit Kindu where the FARDC battalion
being trained by Belgians is based. He will then visit Kisangani in Orientale
province, where the Belgian army is helping the United Nations Mission in Congo
(MONUC).

The Belgian defense chief arrived in DR Congo on Thursday through the maritime
port of Matadi, which is located 355 km southwest of Kinshasa in Bas-Congo
province, aboard a Belgian military ship "Godetia". The ship made a technical
call at Pointe- Noire in the Republic of Congo before reaching Matadi in DR
Congo.

According to the spokesman for the Congolese Defense Ministry, "the visit by De
Grem is under the program of intensification of military cooperation between DR
Congo and the Kingdom of Belgium."
