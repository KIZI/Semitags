Drug manufacturing has a toxic and largely hidden impact on the Australian
community, scientists warned on Thursday, pointing to the chemical fall-out of
clandestine methamphetamine labs.

The temporary labs, often set up in rental flats and houses, produce chemical
waste that poses an unwitting poisoning and even cancer risk to future residents
and those living nearby.

The Cooperative Research Center for Contamination Assessment and Remediation of
the Environment (CRC CARE) also said as these labs were routinely shifted they
left a trail of potentially toxic properties.

"The places they do it ... can become contaminated with volatile chemicals that
may endanger the health of subsequent residents who may be completely unaware
their home has been used as a drug factory," professors Ravi Naidu and Megharaj
Mallavarapu said in a statement on Thursday.

"We do know that over five kilos of toxic waste are generated for every kilo of
methamphetamine drug produced."

The professors said New Zealand authorities had recently moved to tear down
several houses where drugs had been made because they were deemed too hazardous
for anyone to live in.

The contaminants produced in illegal methamphetamine labs include known
carcinogens like benzenes and other toxins such as methylene chloride,
trichloroethane and toluene, which pose a risk to human health through
inhalation or skin absorption, or contaminated drinking water.

The professors said a drug lab was often used for a brief period and then
abandoned without any attempt at safe and scientific clean-up.

"The volatile toxic chemicals used in making drugs do not disappear when drug-
making ceases on site," they said. in a statement.

"The most at-risk populations are drug cooks and subsequent residents or
neighbors of labs but police, fire fighters, environmental inspectors and other
public servants may also be exposed."

The professors said more research was needed to assess the risk posed by the
illegal drug lab waste, and the related contamination of homes, though the
chemicals involved were known to persist in the environment "over a number of
years".

Their pervasiveness also helped law enforcement, as scientists were able to
"chemically fingerprint" a drug lab and then find the same contamination on
those "cooks" who operated it.

"Effective legislation and tougher penalties for the cooks may help to reduce
the number of illicit labs in operation," the professors said.

"... But it would also help if young people who buy these drugs were more aware
of their impact on others and on the environment."

The CRC Care, based at the University of South Australia, is a partnership of
scientific, industry and government organizations set up to combat chemical
contamination.
