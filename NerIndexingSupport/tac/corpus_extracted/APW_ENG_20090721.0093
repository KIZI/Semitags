Mexican soldiers have arrested a suspected drug trafficker in the border city of Tijuana who was carrying jewelry, narcotics and $3.6 million in cash.

The Defense Department says Luis Ibarra belongs to a cell in charge of making and trafficking methamphetamine for alleged drug kingpin Teodoro Garcia Simental. Ibarra was detained Saturday.

Garcia Simental has been waging a bloody battle against his former bosses in the Arellano Felix drug cartel.

Meanwhile, police in Ciudad Juarez, across from El Paso, Texas, say three men were killed outside a bar before dawn Monday.

Chihuahua state prosecutors spokesman Vladimir Tuexi says assailants chased the victims from the bar and shot them in the parking lot.
