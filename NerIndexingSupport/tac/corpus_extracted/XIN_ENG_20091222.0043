Digital Multimedia Broadcasting (DMB) technology first developed by South Korea
will be launched in Cambodia on a trial basis, said the Korea Communications
Commission (KCC) Wednesday.

The KCC, South Korea's telecommunication regulator, officially announced in a
press release that the start of its test run with Cambodia's national
broadcaster TVK on delivering terrestrial DMB services in the country at a
ceremony held in Phnom Penh Tuesday.

The Cambodian government will decide on converting the trial program into a
full-scale service in the first half of next year, the KCC said.

Prior to this announcement, the two sides signed a memorandum of understanding
on DMB service cooperation last October, the regulator said.

In order to expand the DMB service to overseas markets, the KCC is also in the
process of promoting full-scale services in Egypt and Malaysia, after conducting
pilot programs last year, it added.

DMB is a service that allows users to receive multimedia such as TV, radio, and
data-casting directly to their mobile devices.

The breakthrough technology was originally developed in South Korea and the
world's first official mobile TV service started in May 2005.
