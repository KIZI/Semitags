Cheers echoed through Morgan Stanley when John J.
Mack returned to save the soul of the bank, the bluest of Wall
Street's blue-bloods, in the summer of 2005.

Four years on, Mack -- his bank and reputation smarting from the
financial crisis -- is bequeathing Morgan Stanley to a relative
newcomer: James P. Gorman, the quiet power behind a new push to
lure ordinary investors to the bank's blossoming brokerage
business.

The appointment, announced on Thursday, ends months of
speculation over who will succeed Mack as head of what was, until
recently, one of the most prestigious and successful banks on Wall
Street. Unanswered are the many questions still swirling over
Mack's legacy -- and, now, over Gorman, his handpicked successor.

Gorman, 51, will become chief executive on Jan. 1; Mack, 64,
will remain chairman. The handoff is far smoother than the one that
occurred when Mack returned in triumph after a shocking boardroom
coup.

But the bitter, internal feud that opened the door for Mack was
nothing compared to the turmoil that followed. Mack presided over
an era of unprecedented profits -- and then record losses. Only a
year ago, Morgan Stanley nearly foundered like Lehman Brothers. It
was saved, like so much of Wall Street, by a multibillion-dollar
bailout and other government aid.

Wall Street has rendered a harsh judgment on Mack's stewardship.
On his watch, Morgan Stanley's share price lost nearly a third of
its value, while the stock of its archrival, Goldman Sachs, has
gained. After skating so close to the edge, Mack retreated from the
high-risk businesses that almost cost him his bank. To many, Morgan
Stanley seemed to lose its old swagger.

To Morgan Stanley insiders, the diminished role for Mack, who
spent all but a few years of his career at the bank, is not only a
changing of the guard but the end of an era. He and Gorman will
hold a town hall-style meeting at Morgan Stanley's Manhattan
headquarters on Friday.

"It will be emotional," said one senior executive.

Gorman will come to the job with a far different pedigree than
Mack. A lanky, cerebral Australian who dislikes being called Jim,
Gorman is currently co-president in charge of Morgan Stanley's
global wealth management. He joined Morgan Stanley less than four
years ago, from Merrill Lynch, where he ran the global private
client business. Before that he was a senior partner at McKinsey &
Co.

For much of the last year, Gorman and another executive, Walid
A. Chammah, who runs the investment banking and capital markets
operations, had been vying for the top job. Mack seemed to have
favored Gorman, whom he had hired and promoted through the ranks.

Chammah, a flamboyant man with a penchant for smart suits and
monogrammed shirts, also ruled himself out by insisting on staying
in London, where he lives in South Kensington. He will become
chairman of Morgan Stanley International.

After a dismal second quarter because of problems in Chammah's
half of the bank, the scale tipped decisively in Gorman's favor.
While questions remained over Mack's charismatic but sometimes
unstructured management style, the board had been impressed by
Gorman's ability to switch quickly between jobs and learn fast,
important in a vast conglomerate like Morgan, and especially
appreciated his presentations to the board on the long-term future
of the firm.

For Gorman, the good news came Monday evening, over dinner and
drinks with Mack at Ilili, an upscale Lebanese restaurant in the
Flatiron district in Manhattan (Mack is of Lebanese descent). After
a 10 a.m. conference call on Thursday with board members, the deal
was done. The vote for Gorman was unanimous.

In an interview on Thursday, Mack characterized the succession
as orderly. He said the process of finding a successor had been
under way for about 18 months when he first told the board he
wanted to step down when his contract ended next year and before he
turned 65. He will turn 65 in November. The bank hired a recruiter
to draw up a list of outside candidates, but none of them were
interviewed.

Still, Mack and other executives said he had faced resistance to
his decision to step down, describing a conversation with S. Parker
Gilbert, former chairman and a man who represents old school Morgan
Stanley. He had been one of the so-called Group of Eight who had
agitated to oust Mack's predecessor, Philip J. Purcell, and brought
Mack back to the firm.

"I want you to stay longer," Parker said. "I am confident you
can enjoy the fruits of your work." But Mack answered: "Parker,
after getting through the financial crisis and the way this firm
was pushed around financially and the fear" of going under, he
said he had decided he wanted to go.

Mack will most likely remain a force behind Gorman. The two men
will still have offices next to each other. Gorman, for his part,
said Mack's legacy was secure. "John came back and stabilized the
company and brought back the pride," he said. "He made the right
calls at the right time in an incredibly stressful situation," he
said.

While Gorman lacks Mack's flash and is far less known in
financial circles, people who know him said he was up to the job.

R. Glenn Hubbard, dean of Columbia Business School, who has
known Gorman since his days at Merrill Lynch, said he was a
"strategic thinker" and his qualities made him "a good recipe
for success." He described Gorman as a "terrific pick." Gorman
sits on the school's board.
