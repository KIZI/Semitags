Here is where you post the best stundie nominees. Remember these are funny quotes that exhibit: lax logic, impossible situations, wrong facts and irony in relation to conversations about conspiracy theories.

Keep them short and sweet.

superlogicalthinker doesn't believe in cause and effect. Explosions after the collapse brought the towers down.

 
 
Hell no. They occur AFTER the collapse of the building and thus mean exactly sod-all. Do you grasp this concept?

 
You can still hear em right? Big deal if they came from after the collapse, do you know haw they prepare a building for demolition? Obviously not. I believe 7 still standing eh?

In the bizarre thread, "Homosexuality is a Choice" (  http://forums.randi.org/showthread.php?t=188176  ), JonathanQuick links to this INSANE webpage:

 http://www.traditioninaction.org/Hot...Statistcs.html 

It includes gems like:

 
•Of homosexuals questioned in one study reports that 43% admit to 500 or more partners in a lifetime, 28% admit to 1000 or more in a lifetime, and of these people, 79% say that half of those partners are total strangers, and 70% of those sexual contacts are one night stands (or, as one homosexual admits in the film "The Castro", one minute stands) (3). Also, it is a favorite past-time of many homosexuals to go to "cruisy areas" and have anonymous sex.

 
That is A LOT of ***********.

 
•Judge John Martaugh, chief magistrate of the New York City Criminal Court has said, "Homosexuals account for half the murders in large cities"

 
Either that's a slight to the gang-bangers or most of the gang-bangers are gay.

 
•Homosexuals are 100 times more likely to be murdered (usually by another homosexual) than the average person, 25 times more likely to commit suicide, and 19 times more likely to die in a traffic accident

 
100? Really?

But the conspiracy part, that makes it Stundie-worthy, is the "HOMOSEXUAL AGENDA" part:

 
•Because homosexuals can't reproduce naturally, they resort to recruiting children. Homosexuals can be heard chanting "TEN PERCENT IS NOT ENOUGH, RECRUIT, RECRUIT, RECRUIT" in their homosexual parades. A group called the "Lesbian Avengers" prides itself on trying to recruit young girls. They print "WE RECRUIT" on their literature. Some other homosexuals aren't as overt about this, but rather try to infiltrate society and get into positions where they will have access to the malleable minds of young children (e.g., the clergy, teachers, Boy Scout leaders, etc.) (8). See the DC Lesbian Avengers web page, and DC Lesbian Avengers Press Release, where they threaten to recruit little boys and girls. Also, see AFA Action Alert.

 
Of course, "we recruit," probably means, "we want other lesbians to join us," but why derail the crazy train?

And, finally, the rare "This really is the political agenda, and it's reasonable, but we will present it as though it's an insane conspiracy":

 
•Part of the homosexual agenda is to get the public to affirm their filthy lifestyle, as one homosexual admitted in the October 1987 homosexual rally on Washington: "We are no longer seeking just a right to privacy and a protection from wrong. We also have a right -- as heterosexual Americans already have -- to see government and society affirm our lives"

 
 
 
Another one from little grey rabbit in the "totally batcrap insane" category.

 
Really, this is disappointing. I was hoping to discuss the symbology of the Eagle lunar module and the Columbia command module for a further understanding of the Rapture. Instead I am supposed to explain to imbeciles why the lunar surface is going to a little bit brighter than a flourescent street lamp?????

Alas, my talents are wasted here.

 
If any of you even understand the second sentence, I urge you to get psychological help. Quickly.

It's a bit hard to tell, but I think thecritta thinks WTC7 fell to slowly. Or maybe too fast. Or possibly both.

 
I dont understand because the was a freefall period of about 2.25 seconds right so the rest of the time the collapse was encountering resistance so this means that there must have been intact floors in order for their to be resistance as it fell because as i understand it if the building does not descend at a complete rate of free fall without any resistance which i didnt most of the time anyway, so how could the building have been encountering and resistance as it feel if the floors are not there can someone explain where this resistance has come from if there are no intact floors to crush to create some resitance?

 
Ideas, anyone?

Is this "no intact floors" thing a strawman that he's arguing against, or does he believe there were no intact floors during the collapse?

If the latter, perhaps explosives were used in a futile attempt to keep the building from collapsing.  
 
 
Orac at  Respectful Insolence  spotted this one that's too good to not share  

 
I just want to add another major event that got sidelined last year (I think due to a volcano eruption in Iceland) during the H1N1 fiasco. The airplane crash in Poland that killed the President of Poland, his wife and the entire governing body. The crash was the 70th anniversary of the massacre of 22,000 Polish military officers and intellectuals in 1940 by Josef Stalin's NKVD secret police

Poland was the only country in Europe who rejected the H1N1 shot and the only country who refused to do business with the IMF.. conicidence? I think not.

Who puts their entire gov't body on the same air plane? noone.

Could this group be secretly terrorizing our government into silence?

I believe we are dealing with a group of sociopaths with a diabolical agenda.. I think it is real.

Here is a nice explanation of how we are being brainwashed by the evil elite from mfrey0118 on the ever stupid icke side

And now we have all digital signal, you don't think that underlying code and subliminal programming are rampant in digital signal?"

Yeah...what is it?

You don't even know why terminal velocity exists, do you?

 
It's acceleration due to gravity....... I think Earth's terminal velocity is 172 feet per second per second and the moon's is about a 1/4 of the Earth's.

 
I count three basic errors, but I wasn't trying hard.

Well, three basic errors, but at least 2 more advanced errors. Depending on how you count them, I guess, and how charitable you are in interpreting what he actually means.
 
 
...and his understanding isn't getting any better with people explaining the concept to him.

 
 
Let me Google that for you:
Acceleration due to gravity on the moon is approximately 1.62ms -2
Acceleration due to gravity on the earth is approximately 9.81ms -2

So something dropping to earth speeds up almost exactly 6 times faster than a similar object dropping to the moon. The other big difference is that the earth has an appreciable atmosphere, which means that the object falling to earth does not keep speeding up indefinitely. Due to its wind resistance, it will eventually stop speeding up - that speed is its "terminal velocity". OK? The moon has no atmosphere to speak of, so an object will keep accelerating until it hits the surface.

Now, how about in turn you tell us a bit about your wind turbine idea?  

 
Light has a Terminal Velocity....... Light doesn't keep on getting faster and faster. Yes the speed of light is fixed  

 
 
 
 
There were more than three eye witnesses viewing the rocket launches, but the first moon walk was supossedly only beheld by three lonely guys. Even Michael Jackson mimicked the moon walk but he was never there.

How deep does the rabbit hole go?

 
He doesn't believe the moon landings because no one was on the moon to see them happen!

Rob Menard likening the law society to a cult        
 http://www.davidicke.com/forum/showthread.php?t=65275 

 
Read this and compare to the Law Society and bear in mind, they go to Court and 'pray' for remedy to someone they call 'Worship.' Is there any part of this list that does not apply to the law societies?

25 ATTRIBUTES OF A CULT:
This list is taken from a college course called The Psychology of Fundamentalism offered by the University of Texas

1. the leader is charismatic and often militaristically demanding

2. the leader is always right

3. elitism, the leaders treated as royalty or a sense of awe, hierarchical, authoritarian power structure

4. lower members get no respect, or get abused

5. leader is not held accountable for his actions or the actions of his authority structure

6. leader will not tolerate or receive criticism, but leader criticizes all others

7. there is no exit (There is always an exit  its the same doors you came in!!)

8. if members exit they are considered rebellious, out of the will of a higher power or the leader

9. members do not have any association with members that have left the group

10. there are no graduates from the program or group, just deserters or evil people

11. there is cult speak (a language many others can not understand)

12. personal attacks on critics or those who are not in the group

13. solidarity within themselves, no outside allegiance or association

14. use of guilt to manipulate members (I dont carry guilt so I cant relate to this.)

15. the leaders of group are self absorbed

16. instant community

17. members unable to tell the truth

18. money grubbing

19. newcomers dont think right and need to be trained

20. system of punishment and reward

21. intrusiveness

22. sense of powerless, dependency, covert fear, guilt

23. members and leaders are imbalanced or mentally ill

24. thought stopping language, clichés, or slogans

25. demands of ultra loyalty or ultra trust in the groups process and others

From my experiences with the law society, they mave all these attributes, but they think that everyone is subject to their cult.

 Bashdi  for destroying history as we know it.

 
December 7, 1941
Never forget.
That line item to congress about America and Japanese were at peace prior to Dec 7 1941 is bull.

Look up the Hell's Angels and the Flying Tigers. The USA had been kicking the butts of Japanese planes for almost 5 years in china, before japan retaliated (pearl harbor)

The majority of americans do no know, the japanese did not randomly attack.

it is one of the nasties of how our government works; lack of responsibility!

I will always remember pearl harbor as the day our government declared war on an enemy that 'we the people' created. (kind of like how 'we the people' created Osama bin laden)

Yes, the USA was actively trying to keep Japan from expanding prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor. The Japanese after all did believe they had a legitimate grievance with the USA to justify going to war. Bish just gets the pesky facts wrong.
 
 
Oystein gives a good explanation of holohoax physics in this post....

a) A burning human body releases net heat rather than consuming any. The problem is to initially cook away the water in the bodies, which takes some external fuel and makes burning single corpses inefficient. But once you have dried the first corpses in a larger pile and gotten them to burn, the process becomes mostly self-sustaining, you only need to provide ventilation.

No passengers survived.It was a B25 bomber,not a commercial flight.Wrong again.

''Luckily, the accident occurred on a weekend, with only about 1,500 people in the building -- compared with the 10,000-15,000 on an average weekday. Still, 14 died in the accident -- 11 in the building, plus Colonel Smith and the other two occupants of the plane. Hardest hit was the Catholic War Relief Office on the 79th floor, directly in the path of the bomber. Eight relief office workers were killed. ''

Could The Sun be.........
A planetoid which houses some forms of spiritual and powerful lifeforms like God himself?? Sounds daft, I know it but The Sun does govern basically everything now doesn't it. These beings could be hidden behind its fiery surface, away from humanoid eyes and thoughtforms and also the telescopes of NASA too.
I was thinking about the Moon Matrix but the Sun is something which I reckon holds many of the unknown keys of humanity and extra-terristrial life.
The Sun maybe a big planetoid too.

There is many things in this Universe which is beyond the mindset of scientists who basically believe what is written before them instead of researching like us.
The Sun, to me seems like a massive Planetoid which must be housing all these beings which have created thoughtforms in Earth. And sinisterly, has anyone noticed that those UFOs come from the direction of The Sun.
What baffles me is that mercury with the great heat of the Sun has not crumbled now, has it, but then this Universe has a lot of secrets.
Secrets that man never stepped on the surface of the Moon because the feat was way too impossible indeed.

Which is it stelios????

 

If the ISS was in freefall it would fall to Earth and crash and burn and people would die and money would be wasted.
Instead, maybe because it is not an American design, they put thrusters on the ISS in order to fire and maintain the low Earth orbit. Therefore prevent it from going into freefall.
Are you really suggesting anything different?
The very fact that the ISS stays up there proves it is not in free fall.

lastly i find it hard to believe that a firefighter with a type 3 fire cert wouldn't know the difference between the sound of falling rubble and an explosion. there are very big differences in the report of a shape charge and the thud of rubble... also some of the firefighters reported explosions before the building began to collapse.

and lastly they reported WT7 fell BEFORE it actually fell...combine that with an interview of the owner of the building saying that he told them to pull it...and that is enough to provide reasonable doubt that a NUCLEAR BOMB SHELTER(which is what WT7 was) and the EMERGENCY COMMAND CENTER FOR THE CITY just fell down...which is ludicrous and shows a little lack of reality on your part.

Are there any reasons why runways for airliners should not be roofed?

Huge open ended hangars, allowing planes to fly in and out, making all weather airports a possibility?

It would have covered bays off the hangar also for (dis)embarking. The roof could even be retractable into the ground either side of the runway during good weather.

Sides of the roof could be shuttered and openable to allow for cross winds during landing /take off.

A burning human body releases net heat rather than consuming any. The problem is to initially cook away the water in the bodies, which takes some external fuel and makes burning single corpses inefficient. But once you have dried the first corpses in a larger pile and gotten them to burn, the process becomes mostly self-sustaining, you only need to provide ventilation.
The first sentence sounds like a violation of the first law of thermodynamics, although I might not be understanding what Oystein is saying.

The rest of what he says is nonsense. Boiling off the water in our bodies will not leave a fuel source that can create a self-sustaining fire for burning more bodies. Theoretically, if there is sufficient wicking material, a burning body could consume itself except for the bones and teeth. In the real world you'll need an external fuel source to create a very hot fire to completely consume a body. There are no economies of scale. You will never create a fire from burning corpses that will sustain itself to burn more corpses.

Saggy's mistake was presenting this quote from Oystein as an answer to a holocaust denier. Pretend Oystein said this in support of spontaneous human combustion and you'll see the problems.

You probably do misunderstand.

 
The rest of what he says is nonsense. Boiling off the water in our bodies will not leave a fuel source that can create a self-sustaining fire for burning more bodies.

 
Wrong. If you had looked at my full posts that Saggy wanted to stundy, including references, you would know that this is the entire point of my argument: The body contains more fuel than necessary to cook off water, and therefore, once you cooked of the water, there will be fuel left.

 
Theoretically, if there is sufficient wicking material, a burning body could consume itself except for the bones and teeth.

In the real world you'll need an external fuel source to create a very hot fire to completely consume a body.

 
Exactly. Theoretically. In practice, as I already posted myself before Saggy came along, you'd probably need a little extra fuel to account for inefficencies, and that's why the indented quote above contains the word " mostly self-sustaining "

 
There are no economies of scale. You will never create a fire from burning corpses that will sustain itself to burn more corpses.

 
Wrong. There are economies of scale.

 
Saggy's mistake was presenting this quote from Oystein as an answer to a holocaust denier. Pretend Oystein said this in support of spontaneous human combustion and you'll see the problems.

 
No. There will be no spontaneous combustion because you initially need external fuel to cook away the water. Again, that was the basic premise of my argument, and you managed to miss it. Human tissue is not easily set aflame without prior drying.

Slowly, again, for you: The body, being wet, doesn't burn by itself, as evaporating body water will keep temperatures too low to sustain a fire. So for the first body (or bodies), you need external fuel to cook away enough water. Once you have accomplished this, the body will continue burning on its own, and release more energy in the process than you put in externally to cook away the water. Now that you got your first body (or bodies) burning, you can use the heat of their fire to cook away the water of additional bodies, without adding any more (or at least much) additional external fuel. The process becomes ( mostly ) self-sustaining after you dried your first layer of bodies sufficiently to make them flammable.
Why is this? Because the fuels of the body (fat, dry organic tissues) release about 10 times as much energy by burning than you need to cook away (evaporate) the 40kg of water in an average body.

Could you please acknowledge that you got it now?

This is a wonderful piece of confused thinking from tempesta29. Any arguments as to whether it's likely that somebody chose to use thermite in demolishing the WTC are completely invalid, because decisions involve no random element.

 
When you're talking about the conscious decision-making of individuals, in this case using thermite in demolition, probability has little relevance, because that occurrence did not take place as the result of seemingly random events; someone simply chose to use a highly volatile incendiary in a controlled demolition.

 
So, apparently, there's no actual reason why anyone chose to use a method of demolition that had never been tried before, but the lack of a reason means it wasn't a random event.

Have you pointed out to him that a "bomb shelter" isn't exactly the same thing as a "fallout shelter"?

 
A fallout shelter is a shelter designed specifically to survive a nuclear war, with thick walls made from materials intended to block the radiation from fallout resulting from a nuclear explosion. Many such shelters were constructed as civil defense measures during the Cold War. A blast shelter protects against more conventional bomb blasts. It differs from a fallout shelter, in that its main purpose is to protect from shock waves and overpressure, instead of from radioactive precipitation, as a fallout shelter does.

 
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomb_shelter 
 
 
A lot of the quotes from tempesta29 are problematic because they are true statements when taken out of context. I had to go and read the surrounding posts to understand what was actually being claimed or defended.

Has anyone ever been to another "planet"?
However the purity of the paranoia is what makes the post so juicy for me, particularily because I believe that Cole has me, among others, in mind as one who guides unsuspecting persons in to the abyss of nutterdome.

Thread topic is 'breaking'   news about NASA erroneously losing/erasing videos of the first Lunar landing. The OP also qualifies as a Stundie.

 
He has successfully debunked Star Trek.
 
 
 
You probably do misunderstand.

Wrong. If you had looked at my full posts that Saggy wanted to stundy, including references, you would know that this is the entire point of my argument: The body contains more fuel than necessary to cook off water, and therefore, once you cooked of the water, there will be fuel left.

Exactly. Theoretically. In practice, as I already posted myself before Saggy came along, you'd probably need a little extra fuel to account for inefficencies, and that's why the indented quote above contains the word " mostly self-sustaining "

Wrong. There are economies of scale.

No. There will be no spontaneous combustion because you initially need external fuel to cook away the water. Again, that was the basic premise of my argument, and you managed to miss it. Human tissue is not easily set aflame without prior drying.

Slowly, again, for you: The body, being wet, doesn't burn by itself, as evaporating body water will keep temperatures too low to sustain a fire. So for the first body (or bodies), you need external fuel to cook away enough water. Once you have accomplished this, the body will continue burning on its own, and release more energy in the process than you put in externally to cook away the water. Now that you got your first body (or bodies) burning, you can use the heat of their fire to cook away the water of additional bodies, without adding any more (or at least much) additional external fuel. The process becomes ( mostly ) self-sustaining after you dried your first layer of bodies sufficiently to make them flammable.
Why is this? Because the fuels of the body (fat, dry organic tissues) release about 10 times as much energy by burning than you need to cook away (evaporate) the 40kg of water in an average body.

Could you please acknowledge that you got it now?

This is my very first nomination, but since I've been captivated by the car crash that is The David Icke Forums, possibly not my last.

Currently, in the UK, there is an ongoing and high profile police investigation, into the disappearance and subsequent murder of a young woman from Bristol,  Joanna Yeates . In speculating about this case on the Icke Forums, it is becoming clear that 'The Powers That Be' (or 'tptb' as they are affectionately known over there) may be behind the murder.

How was this conclusion reached, you ask?

Why, by the ruthless application of logic, as my nominee  'diamond dogs' states  ;

 
Also both 25..symbolic pic on 2 pillars

 
 

That's right, this act can be put down as a top level TPTB conspiracy because a couple of speed limit signs on a bridge show the same number as the victim's age.
As a traffic engineer I've looked on in sympathy as my civil engineering brethren, structural engineers, have been put in the dock over 9/11, but now it seems our cover is blown too.
Yes, that's right, those innocent little signs you studiously ignore, (unless there's a traffic policeman about), you have completely misunderstood. They are in fact the age limit for that particular area, in a sort of Logan's Run stylee. That you've remained alive thus far is purely luck. We'd have gotten away with it too if it wasn't for those modern-day Sherlocks.

BTW, for the Doubting Thomases amongst you, further corroboration is given by  ach76 with  ;

 
* Ms. Yeates 25 years old

* Woman in earlier, police claim similar case, also 25 years old

* 2 x encircled numbers ' 25 ' in photos of Clifton bridge pylons

* Ms. Yeates' body discovered 25 December

* Alleged 25,000 people per year as per quoted post [in fact, 250,000 per year, but it still starts with '25']

According to Lenin, there are no coincidences

 
I'm convinced.

I finally visited the David Icke forum after seeing that it's the mother lode of Stundies. Little did I realize that what shows up here isn't even the tip of the iceberg. I spent about 20 minutes there. I WANT MY 20 MINUTES BACK!!

The David Icke forum is best taken in small doses, at least until you build up an immunity. Even then some areas can be hazardous to your psyche.

I see it as kind of like the godlikeproductions.com (GLP) forum with a tad more moderation and less anonymity. If you want to avoid serious damage and irreversible harm to your faith in humanity I would advise staying away from GLP.
 
 
Ya know how sometimes on a forum like this one a person will post a statement that's completely whack, just as a joke, knowing that most people will see it for sarcasm/satire?

I no longer get those jokes. People at DIF make statements like that in total seriousness.
 
 
 Here's a grotesque rictus grin of a Stundie , courtesy of Friedrich Paul Berg, aka 'hoaxbuster':

 
Simply by holding their breaths and lying down as low as possible to the ground, any number of Jews would have survived even a thirty minute gassing ordeal.

 
what makes it even more amusing is that about three other junior deniers piled on to chortle in support of Freaky Freddy Berg's pseudoscientific nonsense - which was fortunately torn apart by a Russian PhD physicist and given the Parodie treatment by an American psychologist:

 
if jews held their breath when they were lined up at open pits, facing riflemen, did that protect them from the bullets? or does this magic breath holding reflex only work to save jews in gas chambers?

 
 
 
I don't think I can hold my breath for 3 minutes let alone 30 minutes. These Jewish prisoners must have come from better stock than I.

Then again, if they did manage to survive the gas, what then? Pretend you are dead until you are shoved into a mass grave and then sneak out at night?

Actually the idiot  went on to claim  that it was precisely that very problem which should cast doubt on the scenario. I guess this could also be considered as a nomination:

Some Jews who would have held their breath (a natural reaction) and/or remained close to the floor as the cyanide vapors rose to the ceiling--would have definitely survived. That would have totally undermined the gassing procedure. What would one have done with the "survivors?" Send them in with the next batch, or what? Shoot them in neck as in the Soviet Union? Also, many Jews would have been merely unconscious but NOT dead. What to do with them after one somehow separated them from those who really were dead?
 
 
The other month, I nominated a loony German denier who tried to demonstrate that Jews were essentially inflammable. It didn't score highly in the final poll, but then there's usually a Truther denying the existence of gravity or something.

Still, it should be some consolation that the last remaining deniers have degenerated to the point where they are left arguing that Jews are indestructible.

Heh. I started at GLP. That... might explain a few things now that I think about it.

I want to crack a joke or two about this idiocy, but it turns out the internet hasn't totally desensitised me and some things are still beyond the pale. What sort of mouth-breathing cretin seriously adocates holding your breath in poison gas for thirty minutes as a survival strategy? Hell, why didn't the Jews just catch the bullets in their teeth and spit them back at their captors? And the idea that the Nazis really cared if the people they were burying were dead or just unconscious is either touchingly naive or one of the most moronic attempts to support the Nazis I've ever seen.

The sort who, after seeing that Nazis were not only some of the most evil ***************** of the 20th century, but also some of the biggest losers of that same century, say to themselves, "Yeah, that's what I want to be when I grow up!"
 
 
Ergo has found a new way to reconcile the "buildings fell into their own footprint" claim with the "damaged buildings 300 feet away" claim: redefine the word "footprint" to mean "the area the debris fell into".

 
Demolitioners use the term footprint, and it obviously is not the same thing as a design footprint.

 
But why stop there? Apparently, everything that ever collapsed is now a controlled demolition!

Hey, Harry Houdini was Jewish wasn't he? This ability is probably a side-effect of circumcision along with the supersized lungs. Any volunteers for an experiment?

All I have to go on in that regard are the sites you frequent--used to frequent, the verbiage, as well as the technique---the quote key being one good example---break down a point and make it easier to dissect. easier in your mind anyway.

I usually just open in safe mode and run a log of the server/system and back check IP's---One can learn a lot that way.

Let's assume one or a handful of Jews managed to hold their breaths through the gassing, would the Nazis have said, "Nice work, you sure beat us there. Now you're free to go."?
