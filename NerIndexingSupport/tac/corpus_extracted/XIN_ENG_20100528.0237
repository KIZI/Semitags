The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) said Friday it was unrelated to
the sinking of the South Korean warship "Cheonan" in March, urging Seoul to
receive inspectors from the DPRK.

Pak Rim Su, head of the policy bureau of the National Defense Commission (NDC)
of the DPRK, told a news conference that whether South Korea received the DPRK
inspection group was the key to judging the "Cheonan" incident.

It was the first time that the DPRK authority gave a press briefing over the
sinking of the "Cheonan" after it happened two months ago.

If the investigation results of South Korea were "just and honest," it should
receive the DPRK inspection group, Pak said, stressing that the investigation
should be objective and fair.

A senior DPRK military official showed simulated slides of the occurrence of the
"Cheonan" incident at the press briefing, clearing any DPRK implication to the
sinking.

Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have flared after the "Cheonan," a 1,200-ton
warship with 104 crew members on board, sank on March 26 after an explosion,
killing 46 sailors.

South Korea released the results of its investigation on May 20, accusing the
DPRK of sinking the "Cheonan" in a torpedo attack. However, the DPRK firmly
denied the charges and insisted on sending its own inspectors to verify the
evidence.

South Korea on Monday halted trade with the DPRK, banned merchant ships of the
DPRK from entering South Korean waters, and halted its humanitarian aid for the
children in the DPRK.

South Korean President Lee Myung-bak vowed that his country would resort to
measures of self-defense in case of "further military provocation" by the DPRK
and called for sanctions against Pyongyang.
