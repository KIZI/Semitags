"Govt.-LTTE deal, a conspiracy of Chandrika, Mangala, Sripathi and Ranil"
-Mahinda Wijesekara

The Minister of Special Projects Mahinda Wijesekara states that the
propaganda on President Mahinda Rajapakse's said granting money to LTTE can
be suspected as a political conspiracy of Chandrika, Mangala, Sripathi and
Ranil.

He made these observations addressing a press briefing of the United
National Party - Democratic Group at Seth Sevana party headquarters.

A proposal made by MP Sripathi Suiyaarachchi asking for a parliamentary
select committee to probe the alleged deals between the government and LTTE
was taken up for debate today. The government has proposed amendment to the
proposal to broaden the select committee's time scope until 1989. Minister
Mahinda Wijesekara said that former Ministers Sripathi and Mangala are
making the allegation not because of a political problem but due to a
personal clash.

He said, "Ranil, Mangala and Chandrika are in the same stand on ethnic
problem. President's stance is different and he is hitting the LTTE hard.
Chandrika did not support Mahinda Rajapakse's Presidential campaign. Mangala
Samaraweera helped, possibly expecting the Premiership and began to clash
when it was not granted."

Wijesekara said that Mangala Samaraweera always had a political agenda and
the projects such as 'Thawalama', 'Pothai Gadolai' and 'Sudu Neluma' under
former President Chandrika depicted it.
