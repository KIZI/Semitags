With 3 minutes to go, he said the Giants D looked tired.  He said they
look like they are running in cement for the last couple of plays.
After rewinding TiVo, he was right.  Up by 13 with 3 minutes to go, it
seemed the Giants relaxed just a bit.  They better be careful not to
take that approach.  Play hard for the rest of the game Blue!!!
