Julian Edelman will win the MVP after catching a TD, returning a punt for a TD, and returning an interception for a TD.

If I am wrong, I will be man enough to admit it...but I find it highly improbable for someone to NOT win MVP after accomplishing all that.
 
 
Even bolder Super Bowl prediction... Both teams will play nude this year for the first time in football history. The guy with the biggest chunk of man meat hanging between his legs will be the MVP.
 
 
I see you and raise ya...the Pats will decline appearing, and Buffalo Bills will win. They will bring back Scotty Norwood for one last kick...

   
 
 
It will be played in Indianapolis this year.
What a partying venue!
 
 
The Miami Dolphins will win.
 
 
Go

Patriots!

Girth or length?

Or maybe sack volume?
