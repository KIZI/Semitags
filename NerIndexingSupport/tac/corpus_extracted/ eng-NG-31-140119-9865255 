Didier Drogba is set to demand a move from Chelsea, according to reports
in France.

The Ivory Coast star has become unsettled in West London following the
departure of manager Jose Mourinho.

Last season's top-scorer in England has found Mourinho's departure hard
to take, and now with Milan and Real Madrid circling, Drogba has
admitted he cannot take life with Chelsea anymore.

The cheating fuck.

lol. :)
