Peyton shouldn't have thrown that pass DAMN IT!

Tom Brady is pretty good for a 6th round drafted backup college QB.

And I bet in another 10 years, he will win DWTS...unless, GOD WILLING, that show has been cancelled by then.

I'm not jealous of Peyton. Truth be told, I think he's a hell of a QB. I mean really... what the hell was up with our defense in yesterday's game. They just kept letting them get the downs... allowing Peyton to move the ball down the field. But in the end.... well.. y'all know how it ended.
