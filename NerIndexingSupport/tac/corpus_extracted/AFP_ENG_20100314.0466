World super featherweight champion Humberto Soto defeated David Diaz by
unanimous decision to capture the vacant World Boxing Council lightweight title
on Saturday at Cowboys Stadium.

Soto, who already had the WBC super featherweight belt, dropped Diaz once each
in the opening and final rounds and raised his record to 51-7-2 to win a
12-round decision by judges' scores of 117-109, 117-109 and 115-111.

Mexico's Soto scored the first knockdown in the first round, flooring Diaz with
a hard punch just moments after they clashed heads, opening a cut over Diaz's
right eye.

He dropped Diaz again in the 12th with a combination of lefts and rights just
before the final bell.

Soto controlled the early rounds but American Diaz, 35-3-1, made him work for
the win and seemed to gain strength as the fight progressed.

Sotto and Diaz were fighting on the undercard of the Manny Pacquiao-Joshua
Clottey world welterweight championship, the first fight card in the new 1.2
billion dollar Cowboys Stadium.

The crowd of more than 40,000 was one of the largest indoor gatherings in US
history for a boxing match.
