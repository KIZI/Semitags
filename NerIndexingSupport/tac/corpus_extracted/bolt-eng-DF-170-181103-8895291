By Ryan Grim

Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.) Thursday said he was glad that one of his Democratic opponents, consumer advocate Elizabeth Warren, didn't "take her clothes off" to pay for college. Brown, who won his seat in a 2009 special election, was speaking on Boston radio station WZLX.

Brown made his comments when asked about Warren's response in a debate Tuesday to a question about how she paid for college. The question referenced the fact that Brown posed nude for Cosmopolitan in 1982 to make money.

"I kept my clothes on," Warren said, adding that she borrowed money to go to a public university and worked a part-time job.

Go Elizabeth!!!!!
 
 
yeah, go home to oklahoma
 
 
Scottie Brown rocks.
 
 
This is not good for democracy where one candidate promotes himself by being eye candy, and the other promotes herself by being eye bleach.
 
 
That's worse than when he announced his daughter is signal and ready to mingle.

The guys a moron.
 
 
Elizabeth Warren is a great American patriot. No one fights harder for the middle class.
 
 
So she thinks that because you worked your ass off making a decent living and risking your time and money to "build a factory" that you didn't pay taxes along the way? That you don't pay property taxes and sales taxes?

Obviously this is a person who never ran any kind of business.
 
 
 
Elizabeth Warren is a great American patriot. No one fights harder for the middle class.

 

Yup. Which is why "conservatives" hate her.

She's just another left wing whacko.  
 
 
"You know what, listen: Bottom line is, you know, I didnt go to Harvard, you know, I went to the school of hard knocks, and I did whatever I had to do to pay for school," Brown cut in. "And for people who know me, and know what Ive been through  mom and dad married and divorced four times each. You know, some real challenges growing up. You know, whatever. You know, let them throw stones. I did what I had to do. But [if] not for having that opportunity, I never would have been able to pay for school, and never would have gone to school, and I wouldnt probably be talking to you, so, whatever."    

Kind of makes you wonder what else he did?
 
 
 
Brown's first major gaffe of 2012 race

Scott Brown's reelection campaign isn't exactly starting out well. First his main strategist creates a fake Twitter account and gets caught red handed. Now, he makes fun of how his leading potential opponent looks.

The CrazyKhazei incident was bad but it was mostly inside baseball nonsense that nobody outside of political junkies and media really cared about. In 2012 it will be long forgotten. Making comments about the physical appearance of your leading potential opponent? Well, that's just stupid.

It would seem Masss little dalliance with the GOP will be short-lived.
 
 
Great line by Brown!

Their obsession with widening the gap between Rich and Poor shows up in every single economic policy they advocate.

Well, not that anyone really cares, but it was the questioner at the debate who brought up Brown in Cosmo in the question he asked Warren.

I have to say that the most pathetic thing about this are the women's groups throwing a fit.

  This guy doesn't know Del very well. He acts like your some conservative republican shill  

My take on this....both canidates had a humorus response to their questions, neither did anything wrong, and neither are making a big deal out of it.

Its the media and political groups that are trying to "make hay" out of the situation.

She took a jab at brown, brown took a jab back. End of story, no harm no foul.
 
 
I was once a big supporter of Brown, and voted for him in the special election.

But that was when I still thought he was an independent and that the best interests of his constituency was his top priority. Boy was I duped. His voting record clearly shows that he comfortably snuggled in the pocket of the big oil lobby. We have enough of those in Congress from other states, we don't need one from Massachusetts too.

Warren isn't my first choice, but I'll certainly vote for her over that phony douche Brown.
 
 
 
Elizabeth Warren is a great American patriot. No one fights harder for the middle class.

 

You mean a great Marxist, right comrade?.....

You think you got all the way to Camp Niggerhead all on your own? If it wasn't for the roads "we" paid for, you'd have never made it there. You would have also likely been gang raped along the way without the protection "we" paid for.

So it looks like there are two phony douche's running for office there.

But whatcha gonna do?  
 
 
 
 
Scottie Brown rocks.

 

I hope he enjoys is rock'n 1/2 term tenure in the US Senate.  

 

He might turn up on late night television. Where he probably belongs.

So I guess I'll have to vote for the phony douche more likely to cast votes I agree with, like eliminating government subsidies for corporations generating billions in profit quarter after quarter.

Kind of sad.

Yeah, not wanting to spend taxpayer dollars to subsidize corporations clearly doing fine on their own is decidely leftist.  
 
 
 
 
 
"You know what, listen: Bottom line is, you know, I didnt go to Harvard, you know, I went to the school of hard knocks, and I did whatever I had to do to pay for school," Brown cut in. "And for people who know me, and know what Ive been through  mom and dad married and divorced four times each. You know, some real challenges growing up. You know, whatever. You know, let them throw stones. I did what I had to do. But [if] not for having that opportunity, I never would have been able to pay for school, and never would have gone to school, and I wouldnt probably be talking to you, so, whatever."    

Kind of makes you wonder what else he did?

 

The bizarre thinking of conservatives that it's somehow a good thing to have to suffer just for the sake of getting an education.

 

It's their thing. If you look at other "conservative" positions it's all about suffering for one reason or another.

Bunch of masochists.

 

It is actually because conservatives value working for and actually earning what they have. Liberals seem to see earning and equate that with suffering. Hmmm....

Your joking right? She said something with "negative intentions" about brown first and brown responded in kind yet you only jump on browns case. Such a partisan  

I think neither one said anything wrong, both were making jokes, neither has claimed to be offended...the only people taking offense on either side are political hacks.

I'm not offended. Just pointing out that he was upset about her answer to a specific question and decided to make it a personal attack.
 
 
This is great...I can only imagine what Brown and the rest of the right would be saying if Elizabeth was a stripper during her youth to pay for college.

Your joking right? She said something with "negative intentions" about brown first and brown responded in kind yet you only jump on browns case. Such a partisan  

I think neither one said anything wrong, both were making jokes, neither has claimed to be offended...the only people taking offense on either side are political hacks.

 

I'm not offended. Just pointing out that he was upset about her answer to a specific question and decided to make it a personal attack.

 

Sounds like she was upset that he is attractive enough to get paid to pose while she isn't, after all she started it  .

See when we go on assumptions and not facts we can say whatever we want  
 
 
 
This is great...I can only imagine what Brown and the rest of the right would be saying if Elizabeth was a stripper during her youth to pay for college.

 

Its seems like elisabeth and the left are upset about that type of stuff, why else would they give brown grief over his posing unless they thought it was wrong  
 
 
 
If Warren wins the nomination like it appears she will, she's gonna destroy Brown in debate. This isn't Martha Coakley we're talking about.

 

She will win, the newspapers already crowned her  
 
 
Elizabeth Warren is a douche....

That is all, Carry on.

Yup. Which is why "conservatives" hate her.

 

No, people hate her because she is a dyed in the wool Marxist who isn't fit to be elected dog catcher, let alone Senator.

Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.) Thursday said he was glad that one of his Democratic opponents, consumer advocate Elizabeth Warren, didn't "take her clothes off" to pay for college. Brown, who won his seat in a 2009 special election, was speaking on Boston radio station WZLX.

Brown made his comments when asked about Warren's response in a debate Tuesday to a question about how she paid for college. The question referenced the fact that Brown posed nude for Cosmopolitan in 1982 to make money.

"I kept my clothes on," Warren said, adding that she borrowed money to go to a public university and worked a part-time job.

No shit? I suppose the taxes that were paid by the employees probably helped out, you know, their income taxes, property taxes from the homes they bought, sales taxes from the goods they purchased with the money they made working at the factory, and then of course you have the businesses that built up to support those people who wanted to spend their money and all the people that work for those businesses and all the tax revenue that they represent. And it goes on and on and on........

You see that won't work darling when you hear the original clip. In 2006 and even in 2008 I was begging people to use the new media to combat the moronic left wing that Axelrod was putting out there.

The original clip of this interchange has gone viral. As it should. Because the reality had nothing to do with Liz naked.

She took the first shot. Oh and I know in a liberal world that doesn't mean jack shit but in a conservative world it means everything.

She took the shot at Brown, he responded.

You will have to deal with it somewhere down the road. I don't think she's worth it.

ETA If Obama puts her in his administration, I'll have to go crazy over her.
 
 
Okay, what's with all the sudden terms of endearment.
 
 
Oh I'm just feeling wonderous this moment. Not a worry. I'll hit you hard and fast down the road  

I've got a swarm of juncos in the front yard. Like I told you. I live on a migratory path of birds.
I have juncos in the yard and all the vultures above by the hundreds.

Life is good. Some days one puts politics on the back burner. I wish more real libs could live what I live.

Maybe it would make a difference.
 
 
So when Lizzie makes a crack about Brown, she's a hero, but when Brown responds in kind, he's jerk?

The truth is that you're simply a partisan dingbat with your nose so far up Warren's ass you can taste what she had for breakfast.

 
Why did she? She was asked. It's like this board. I make a quip, something lighthearted, short, and succinct and get back every slam in the book. People are doing the limbo at my expense. There's no low they are not willing to stoop to.

Well, not that anyone really cares, but it was the questioner at the debate who brought up Brown in Cosmo in the question he asked Warren.

I have to say that the most pathetic thing about this are the women's groups throwing a fit.

 

I guess Brown was so upset about her answer he had to say something nasty about her.

Kind of sad.

 

What does, what Brown did way back in 1982 have to do with turning this economy around? It's amazing how the left again is taking focus off the economy, by talking about Brown's history. Brown should consistantly bring up where jobs and the unemployment numbers have gone during the time Obama and the Democrats had control, and force the Democrats to explain their lack of making jobs a priority until the Republicans took control of the House. Place the economy front and center to the American people, while the Democrats try to find other issues they'd rather talk about. ANYTHING but the party's record in Congress during the Obama administration.

If Warren wins the nomination like it appears she will, she's gonna destroy Brown in debate. This isn't Martha Coakley we're talking about.

 

She will win, the newspapers already crowned her  

 

If she wins, it will be another additional nail on the coffin as to why Obama and the Democrats couldn't bring unemployment back down. After all for the Democrats to start out at just over 7% BEFORE the $787 Billion stimulus, to now fighting to keep those numbers below 10%, doesn't look good no matter what "spin" the left tries to put on it. Brown is just one small battle in the fight to put America back to work, the Democrats have to come up with a LOT more "spin" to try and keep Obama's job in the White House.
 
 
The best thing for Scott Brown to do is save his money, gracefully bow out of the race, and gear up for a run at the Governor's chair next cycle.

What she is too stupid to figure out is that the rest of us were able to pay for those roads and services because we had jobs at that factory that she probably wants to shut down because the owner is rich..............
 
 
Leave the sexist card out of the Scott Brown race, please

 
To which I say: Get your panties out of your ass, unless its a thong, which would be physically impossible but you get my drift, and get a sense of humor. Have we as a nation become so unfunny and so beholden to pussyfooting (no pun intended) that weve lost our collective sense of humor?

Why do women need to be treated like such delicate flowers, anyway? If the fairer sex can dish it out, shouldnt we be able to take it? Women have scrutinized and made fun of Governor Chris Christies weight, former Senator and all-around deuche John Edwards hair, and Senator John Kerrys (alleged) Botox treatments, to name a few, yet we are incapable of handling a little joke about not wanting to see a 62-year-old woman naked? Frankly, who would?

 Scott Brown Says He Was 'Joking' With Controversial Remarks About Elizabeth Warren 

Yeah, Scotty, we assumed it was a joke - a sexist one in bad taste.

And had she not made the first comment about it then he never would have said it.

So stop the fake BS, no one gives a rats ass about him saying Thank God after she remarked that she "kept my clothes on."......

Is she even the Dem candidate yet?

He should have never said it, that is the bottom line. No matter what she said, he should have never said it.

Oh come on now, she shouldn't have said it either then.......... Alls fair and all that. Why should he not have said it? Because she is a she? Where's the equality, it's politics, she made a comment he threw it back. It wasn't sexist he could have said the exact same thing had it been a male who started it........
 
 
 
yeah, go home to oklahoma

 

She couldn't get elected dog catcher in Oklahoma.

An Oklahoma Democrat is farther to the right than Scott Brown.

Apparently, he's made a habit of saying in public things that are less than tasteful. For instance, introducing his daughters to a crowd and quipping "They're available."
 
 
I'm certain it was said in a joking overtone. Why is it we cannot have light hearted joking anymore? Or are only the left allowed this now? I'm sorry i simply don't get the memos like I used to.....

The bottom line is that you and every other turd who is harping on Scott Brown are a gang of scathing hypocrites.

Yeah, what terrible and horrible things to say...  

Have we all been reduced to a bunch of ninnies? Are our ears so sensitive?
 
 
 
Elizabeth Warren is a great American patriot. No one fights harder for the middle class.

 

How come she did not point out the other trillions that Obama put us in

nope because everyone wants to be political correct and it might offend a gerbil!

yup she intiated it by making a joke about how Brown posed nude for money for college (which is funny that a "liberal" would take issue with in and of itself) and then he made a joke by saying thank god she didn't get naked.

No big deal from either side in my opinion.

Both made fun of the other in a similar way and I think neither did anything wrong.

I'll humor you and explain it since I seem to confuse you very easily.

Its a joke that is being used to hammer at brown over posting naked (implying that his doing so has negatives attached to it, which is ironic from someone on the liberal side of issues)

Actually she did Dean. The person asking the questions at the debate asked the canidates "How did you afford to go to college" and warren responded "well at least I kept my clothes on"

She brought it up first. Not that it really matters but she did.
