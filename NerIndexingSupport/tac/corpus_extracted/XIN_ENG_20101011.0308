The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) on Monday warned against possible
climate extremes, as moderate to strong La Nina conditions are likely to
continue into at least the first quarter of 2011.

In its latest update of the current La Nina event, the WMO said this La Nina,
following the dissipation of the latest El Nino in April 2010, are "now well
established in the equatorial Pacific."

According to WMO, the phenomenon can be observed from the abnormal ocean
temperature and ocean-atmosphere interaction registered in the central and
eastern equatorial Pacific.

The surface temperature of the vast span of ocean is 1.5 degrees Celsius below
average, and the subsurface water temperature is 2 to 6 degrees Celsius below
average.

Given the current situation, the WMO expected the La Nina conditions to further
strengthen in the next four to six month period.

La Nina is an ocean-atmosphere phenomenon that often occurs in couple with El
Nino. The two events are often regarded collectively as El Nino-Southern
Oscillation climate pattern. A La Nina is often preceded by a strong El Nino.

When La Nina occurs, the sea surface temperature over the central and eastern
equatorial Pacific will be lower than normal, causing major climate fluctuations
around the globe and possible catastrophic weather events in some regions.

The last La Nina was a moderate one, which started in mid 2007 and lasted till
early 2009.
