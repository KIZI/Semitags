Xu Yinsheng, former president of table tennis' world governing body ITTF,
believed the world veterans championships help the sport become more popular
around the world.

The 72-year-old Xu, a table tennis legend in China and ITTF's honorary president
for life, kept an eye on the ongoing 15th WVC, though having not participated.

He said the tournament, originally gathering well-accomplished veteran table
tennis players, had developed to a certain scale.

"There are more and more people getting interested in this veterans'
competition, which shows the tournament's strong vitality," said Xu.

According to Xu the purpose of holding such a tournament is not only to raise
athletes' competive levels, but also promoting the sport itself.

"Table tennis has a certain popularity around the world, including a large
number of participants. The WVC helps to expand the popularity of the sport by
showing that senior people can also enjoy and participate in table tennis," said
Xu.

"Happiness in table tennis" is the theme of the on-going tournament. Xu believed
the theme could reflect the shift of the country's focus from competitive sports
to national fitness.

"Table tennis is a kind of sport which suits public activity in China,"  Xu
added.
