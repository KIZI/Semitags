Ba da boom!
 
 
Seattle not sucking... yet.

To many Red Zone giveaways though.
 
 
titans blow and the birds are down by 14....giants? my god to Seattle?
 
 
 
I hear that the Bills have ordered Fried Eagle for dinner................

 

Looks like they actually had fried eagle delivered before the game even started!  
 
 
The good thing is that The Cowboys can't lose this week...... No matter how hard they try...

They would make for some tasty Buffalo Wings

Seattle is kicking Giant butt and should lead 28-7

Went in 14-14 at the half
 
 
not anymore...friggin giant safety...unreal.
 
 
giants are sum lucky sum bitches...  
 
 
Birds changing trajectory in a big way. If they keep it up they could well pull this off.

No F*#&*$^g turnovers!!!
 
 
I really do hate games where a team just totally self destructs in the 2nd half.........
 
 
 
giants are sum lucky sum bitches...  

 

Great catch though
 
 
wow a lot of games have tightened up...carolina, the friggin colts, Oakland may win.....

Tell me about it... This is the first game of the season Eagles didn't lead at beginning of the fourth
 
 
great losing to the 1-3 Chiefs....unreal...just unreal.
 
 
Went on food/beer run during Seattle game. What is Whitehurst doing out there?
 
 
It's go time baby... 5:39 left, 7 point deficit and Vick on his own 20.
 
 
I was never a dunghy fan, I was less of a Caldwell fan and that decision was downright stupid, and, we lose. can his ass too.

sorry missed that...I have been switching around watching screen in screen..
 
 
wow, the colts just lost by giving up the first down, the giants just allowed a TD and the eagles are what, down to their last gasp...buffs going for it?  
 
 
and the jackass got drawn off.....someone get cuyo the number for suicide prevention...

Three plays after another fucking red zone turnover.

Unbelievable.

Un fucking believable.
 
 
Ya know, it wouldn't be so infuriating if they just had a bad team and were getting outplayed. But that's not the case.

Stupid mistakes are costing us game. After game. After game.

Take away the turnover differential, and the fact that we jump out of the way everytime a team uses the unique and unsuspected tactic of running a guy up the middle, and we'd be running with the best of them.
 
 
Seahawks !!!111!!!!!1!!!

Only game on!  

Yeah, yeah there are three games on from the 4PM (EST) start. Pats v Jets is the only one worth watching.

I hopped that TB would give the 9ers a hard time but damn. TB is getting smoked so far and I don't see a comeback in San Fran. (Don't care about Denver or the Bolts)

Just have to chill till Sunday Night Football I guess.

I meant only game on worth watching. (plethora of 1PM games today)

I don't have satellite, or a TV for that matter but I have all the games, NFL Network and Red Zone by means which shall remain nameless.  

Jets did get hosed but nice quick comeback anyway.
 
 
yea well it done a deal now. some dropped balls and brady hitting some great 3rd down passes....
 
 
Ah yes... one of Life's little pleasures is watching Rex Ryan hold back the tears.

 
 
 
Cam Newton for a rookie is playing damn good ball
Go Panthers
 
 
Know I am late but YEAH STEELERS.. Big ben looked great this week. Its a shame he has to fight for his life every game because of the offensive line!

I'm not really sure! But i'm not really into Baseball, although i think the Tigers are GRRRREEEAAAT! Lol! But the LIONS are KING!

I always looked at Detroit as a hockey town. I was just wondering whether the resurgent Lions or Tigers were drawing more attention

they'll blow it in the end  
 
 
 
 

 

Over half my elimination pool was wiped out picking the Giants, including one of my teams!

Quite a game. CAL running backs put on a show for both teams and the Lions appear to be the real deal. Next week the Niners & Lions have earned some face time though I doubt either team will get the recognition they've earned.
 
 
Lions 5-0!

I don't live in Detroit (Thank God!)....but i know the whole state is going nuts over the Lions and Tigers! All i watch is football, so i'm not a good one to ask  
 
 
The crowd noise at Ford Field was deafening! No doubt partly responsible for all the false starts by the Chicago OL, although trying to block Detroit's DL probably had 'em a little jumpy too. Gotta give some credit to Cutler, he took the heat and played pretty well I thought.
