The National Debt
With a "Noble" Solution
Richard E. Noble

In the two hundred years B.R. (before Ronald Reagan) the entire accumulated debt of all of our previous presidents amounted to 909.1 Billion dollars. So B.R., our country√ïs National Debt had not yet reached one trillion dollars - that stack of dollar bills had not yet reached the moon. Now, remember, that figure included all the debt accumulated from George Washington through Jimmy Carter. That 909.1 Billion dollars included all the monies borrowed for the American Revolution, the Civil War, World War I, World War II, Korea and Vietnam.

By the time that Ronald Reagan left office in 1988 the National Debt was 2,601.3 Billion or 2.6 Trillion. In just eight years Ronald Reagan had more than doubled what all the previous presidents from Washington through Carter had accumulated in the prior 200 years.
 The National Debt with a Noble Solution 

Never before have so few with so much promised to take away so much from so many and then laugh their asses off as the so many with so little vote for the so few with so much."
A James Pence Quote
 
 
Reaganomics, the country living on a credit card, was the beginning of turning our nation over to the national and world financiers.
 
 
The Current ReaganBush Debt is:
$14,317,998,346,412.80
which means that in a total of 20 years,
these three presidents have led to the creation of
93.87%
of the entire national debt
in only 8.4746% of the 236 years of the existence of the United States of America.

And yet, there are some who want to continue with this policy of fiscal "irresponsibility" by voting for Republicans. When will they learn that we simply cannot afford the caste society the plutocratic GObP/Repubs are building ?

Why in the world would anyone vote for a tax and spend Republican?

Obamination is spending TRILLIONS, not billions.
 
 
This country is going to continue to borrow money from China until China won't lend us anymore. Then we are going to go belly up.

It's because the revenue/expenditures are out of sync and have been since we went with the Bush tax cuts and then operated wars without additional taxes. There is a simple solution, but not going to go down well with unpatriotic children who don't wish to pay their way.
 
 
Uh, the wars in the middle east are about 3.5% of our GDP, pretty much nothing compared to 35% during WWII.

The majority of our debt comes from left-wing social spending on social security, green energy scams, etc.

Reagan was actually growing the economy when he spent money whereas Obamination is ruining the economy just like bucktooth Carter.
