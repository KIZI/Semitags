Romania's Prime Minister Emil Boc on Monday sacked Interior Minister Dan Nica
after he alleged that a ruling coalition partner would try to rig the country's
presidential election.

Boc also blamed Nica for a crime explosion in the country as a rift between
rival parties in the ruling coalition widened ahead of the November 22 election.

"Mr Nica alleged someone was planning to rig the vote. This is a serious, though
completely groundless, accusation which calls into question the fairness of the
election," Boc said.

Nica is from the Social Democrat (PSD) party, a junior partner in the ruling
coalition. He had accused the bigger Democrat-Liberals (PDL) of arranging a
multiple vote scam.

He said the PDL had rented all available buses on voting day to transport people
to different polling stations so they can vote several times. The multiple-vote
scheme has been widely used in Romanian elections.

Boc, from the PDL, said the Social Democrats have 24 hours to name a new
interior minister.

Boc blamed Nica for an "explosion of criminality" and a "serious deterioration
of people's safety" while interior minister.

"The crime rate has gone up by 13 per cent compared to last year. We have been
witnessing an unprecedented rise in the number of armed thefts and bank
robberies," he said.

PSD president Mircea Geoana dismissed the accusations against Nica and said that
the PDL, President Traian Basescu's party, wanted to push the PSD out of the
coalition formed in December 2008.

Sacking Nica "will plunge Romania into a severe political crisis," he said.

After an emergency meeting, the PSD asked Boc to cancel the sacking, warning
that the government could fall.

President Basescu said he was available for talks between the two parties if
needed.

Some analysts say the rival parties have no choice but to break their alliance
ahead of the election campaign. Each has its own candidate for the November 22
vote. Other analysts said the government should survive as no party has the
required majority to govern alone.

The Romanian constitution forbids any dissolution of parliament in the six
months before a presidential election.
