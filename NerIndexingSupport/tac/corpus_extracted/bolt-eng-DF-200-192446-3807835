Oh dear. Is this England? Is there something wrong with us?

Two young girls get raped about an hour ago. Police swarm in. Whole street comes alive with people. 10 minutes later, one of the neighbours of the adjacent street gets her car smashed in by drunken youths. One youth has been caught (obviously drinking), but the street is swarming with more police now. Pub over the road gets emptied and crowds of people gang up on small lad accused of smashing the car. Two youths then have a fight and one of them is on the road crying his eyes out saying that his brother is going to get killed. And the police want to talk to me, to see if I saw anything.

This town is supposedly the most traditional Christian urban town in the UK. Something has gone wrong. Although there are gangs of youths and hoodies here, they are usually nothing more than stray petty thieves.

Rape, vandalism, vigilantism, murder, anti-social behaviour...all in one night, in less than an hour, in one small area.

Hello, welcome to planet Earth.
 
 
"This is England" - No, it's the town where you live, and said town does not represent the whole country.
 
 
If the lad smashed up a woman's car for no reason he deserves his head kicking in. It'll make him think twice about drinking more than he can handle and doing something stupid like that again.

Aside from the rape, this all stems down to the fact the 'youths' have no respect and know they can get away with stuff, and the vigilantism comes from the Normal, honest people in the pub because they know the police won't do s*** and the youths will get away with it.

I am on the side of the pub goers.
 
 
I apologise for stating the obvious, though the area you live in does not represent the whole of England. (Just to prove a point), where I live those crimes are virtually unheard of.
 
 
Really, is that England?

Three cars pass all close by each other. Two young men in duffle coats pass by leisurely, chatting. A white van parks briefly and delivers something to an opposite house. A cat scampers across the road, safely burying itself in a bush before continuing its journey to the window of a flat.

Mundanity, vans, felines and clouds.

THIS IS ENGLAND!!!*shift1*!!1

This is true, without us humans, you couldn't get a better place!

There are bad people in the world. It's not the fault of one country. Come to the south side of Chicago in America and I'll show you a scary ****ing time.
