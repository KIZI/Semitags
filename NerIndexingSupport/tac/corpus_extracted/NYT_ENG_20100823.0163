The U.S. commander in charge of building up
Afghanistan's security forces said Monday that in the next 15
months he would have to recruit and train 141,000 new soldiers and
police officers -- more than the current size of the Afghan army --
to meet President Barack Obama's ambitious goals for getting Afghan
forces to fight the war on their own.

The commander, Lt. Gen. William B. Caldwell IV, said the large
recruiting number was to allow for attrition rates in some units of
nearly 50 percent.

Overall, Caldwell said it would not be until October 2011 --
three months after the deadline for the start of U.S. withdrawals
set by Obama -- that he will have finished building the Afghan
security forces to their full capacity. For now, he said, "they
cannot operate independently."

Caldwell's remarks, made by video feed from Kabul, the Afghan
capital, to reporters at the Pentagon, underscored the challenge
the Obama administration faces in trying to turn around the
9-year-old war, which has deteriorated on the ground and become
increasingly unpopular among Americans. Training Afghan security
forces to defend their own country remains at the heart of Obama's
strategy for ending the U.S. involvement in the war.

Despite the challenges, Caldwell said he had made progress and
had so far met his recruiting targets. Currently, the Afghan army
numbers 134,000, with a goal of 171,600 by October 2011. The Afghan
National Police has 115,500 officers, with a goal of 134,000 by
October 2011.

Desertions and resignations continue to be a problem. "In the
Afghan National Police, the attrition rate is unacceptable,"
Caldwell said, citing a current rate of 47 percent, down from a
peak of 70 percent.

Another major problem, he said, is illiteracy. The vast majority
of Afghan recruits cannot read and write in their own language,
meaning that basic tasks, like knowing the serial numbers of their
weapons, are impossible. As a result, the United States has started
a basic literacy program, with 27,000 recruits currently enrolled
and an expectation that 100,000 will be in the program by next
summer.

"We're not trying to make high school graduates," Caldwell
said. "Our intent is to give them enough to have the ability to do
certain key things for the professionalization of the force."

For example, he said, "if they're issued equipment and told
that they're supposed to have four shirts, three pairs of pants and
two pairs of boots on a piece of paper, they can actually read that
and then look at the equipment instead of being reliant on somebody
else to do that for them."

Caldwell said illiteracy had created a problem among Afghan
soldiers in the north last week, when 90 out of a group of 100
soldiers told U.S. commanders they had not been properly paid by
electronic funds transfer, the system now used for most of the
Afghan army payroll.

"The money was in fact in their accounts -- they just had no
ability to, in fact, look at a bank statement or read the ATM
machine to understand they had been paid," Caldwell said. "Had
they had some basic literacy training, they would have known
that."

One factor that has helped recruiting this year, the general
said, is a raise. Base pay for an Afghan soldier or police officer
is now $165 a month, and in a high-combat area like Helmand
province in southern Afghanistan a soldier can make a starting
salary of $240 a month, up from $180. Caldwell has said in the past
that the Taliban often pays insurgents $250 to $300 a month.

James M. Dubik, an author of a recent report on Afghan military
training and a retired Army three-star general who oversaw the
training of Iraqi security forces in 2007 and 2008, said he was
optimistic about Caldwell's mission. Dubik said Caldwell had
greatly expanded the capacity to train Afghans by increasing the
number of instructors and training locations and changing the
training week from five eight-hour days to six 12-hour days.

Caldwell said drug abuse remained a problem, particularly among
the police. He said drug use on average in the police was found to
be 9 percent, although in certain areas it was much higher. He did
not specify the type of drug abuse.

At an Afghan police training facility outside Camp Leatherneck
in Helmand province, the U.S. Marine commander, Lt. Col. Gerard
Wynn, said in April that American trainers had immediately rejected
10 percent of Afghan recruits because of opium use. But the
trainers did not turn away recruits who showed evidence of
marijuana use because, he said, "it's so prevalent in society that
we'd be kicking everybody out."
