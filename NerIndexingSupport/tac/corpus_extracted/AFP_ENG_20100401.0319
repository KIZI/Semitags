A US astronaut mourned the closure of the "tremendous" NASA space shuttle
programme Thursday, as she prepared to blast off to the International Space
Station (ISS).

"It takes my breath away. To see that go away is very bitter-sweet," NASA
astronaut Tracy Caldwell Dyson told reporters at a news conference at Russia's
Baikonur cosmodrome in the steppes of Kazakhstan.

"It's bitter because we're saying goodbye to such a tremendous part of our space
programme," said the astronaut who has flown as a crew member on the shuttle.

"It's sweet in that it was so successful and it brings to close in such a
positive way something that brought us success in all kinds of ways."

The US Discovery space shuttle is set to be mothballed at the end of this year,
after which US astronauts will only be able to travel to the ISS in Russian
three-seater Soyuz spacecraft.

A successor to the Discovery is scheduled to take off no earlier than 2015.

Caldwell Dyson is set to blast off Friday onboard a Russian Soyuz rocket to
carry out a six-month resupply mission with Russian cosmonauts Alexander
Skvortsov and Mikhail Korniyenko.

The astronauts will spend two days in a cramped Soyuz capsule before arriving at
the ISS, where they will join US astronaut Timothy Creamer, Soichi Noguchi of
Japan and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kotov.

Caldwell Dyson, Skvortsov and Korniyenko are due to return to Earth in
September.
