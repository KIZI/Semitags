The Federation of Internation Football Association (FIFA) Coca-Cola World Cup
trophy tour is scheduled to arrive in Tanzania on Nov. 19 for a three-day tour.

The tour is expected to get positive results as the country was "flying higher"
in the FIFA world rankings than in recent times, the local media on Sunday
quoted the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) secretary general Fredrick
Mwakalebela as saying.

The World Cup tour is staged at a time when Tanzania is making steady progress
in developing football, as the eastern African country now stands at 93rd on
FIFA world ranking, and is expected to move forward following the 2-1 victory
against Rwanda in an international friendly match played in Kigali a few days
ago, according to Mwakalebela.

Meanwhile, Tanzania has seeked FIFA assistance to hold friendlies in October
with top national teams in Africa.

Ghana, Nigeria, Cote d'Ivoire and South Africa were named as ideal countries for
Tanzania to play against, TFF president Leodger Tenga noted.
