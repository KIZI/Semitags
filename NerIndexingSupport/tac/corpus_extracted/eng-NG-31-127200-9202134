Some buzz in the Liverpool NG that Benitez is on borrowed time after
again publically calling out the owners, and that Mourinho is possibly
the #1 target.

It's just a story in Â NOTW which is about as reliable as the "Sun"

In other words it's horseshit

Benitez shouldn't have publicly criticised the owners. They were
extremely supportive of him financially just this summer and now the
season isn't even half done and he's already complaining about funds.

That said, I hope this matter gets resolved. I still have faith that
this ship is being steered in the right direction by Benitez.

I wouldn't be so sure of that. Reina and Alonso are in contact with
Atletico Madrid to play there next season. Torres is also looking for
a way out (maybe Barcelona) if Etoo leaves.. All that indicates that
Benitez has warned them that he is leaving.

That sounds like tabloid gibberish. Athletico has expressed an
interest in Alonso but people have been showing an interest in him for
years.
If Rafa leaves then there likely will be a Spanish clearout but he
himself clearly doesn't want to leave at all. What surprises he is
that he seemed like a pretty laid-back guy his first year or two but
lately he wants to pick a fight with everyone and their grandmother.
Either the pressure's getting to him or that new goatee makes him feel
like a real bad boy.

Who is reporting that?

Sky feels that Rafa reports (including Mourinho link) are credible
becuse it is being reported by Bascombe, who reports for the Echo and
is virtually an insider.
