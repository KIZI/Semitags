the true reason is that voter fraud is a major tool dems use to win elections !!if you have to show ID then it is easier to detect fraud!!you see the libbs don't believe in level playing fields....their victim mentality helps them to rationalize cheating at the ballot box!!to them private ownership,personal responsibility,hard work,business ect...are evils that should be defeated by any means necessary, especially cheating !!...........THANK GOODNESS THAT THEY ARE TO FEMININE AND COWARDLY TO TAKE UP ARMS!!!
 
 
 
THANK GOODNESS THAT THEY ARE TO FEMININE AND COWARDLY TO TAKE UP ARMS!!!

 

Ain't that the truth. If any of the radical environmentalist libs had any balls, then they would take up arms against Obaam's new EPA ruling. Instead, they are probably praying to mother earth and crying of the spotted owl.

That would be interesting. They even go as far as to ban honor roll students getting recognition since they claim that it hurt others who did not make the honor roll list.

Seriously, there is something wrong with them. They are overly sensitive.

LOL
 
 
 
All votes should be legal, but Republicans use voter ID and voter suppression to unfairly disenfranchise poor voters.

 

It is FEDERAL law that every Federal election the voters be verified as being legally allowed to vote. FEDERAL LAW. Except ID, how does one VERIFY if someone is legally whom they claim to be and legally allowed to vote?

Explain in big words how requiring one identify they are who they say they are somehow disenfranchises a legally registered voter.
 
 
Every one of us is required by law to carry ID. Even if you do not drive you still are suppose to carry a State ID card. The only group of People who could possibly be disenfranchised by the Requirement of Showing ID to register are those who for some reason, don't have the ID we are all required by law to carry. Who might those people be?

Wrong, there may not be a specific law that says you MUST have ID, but guess what happens if a cop asks for ID in certain situations and you have none?

And I am waiting, explain how it disenfranchises a legally registered voter from voting if ID is required? Remember it is FEDERAL LAW that requires every voter must be legally able to vote.

True. Contrary to what some might believe, there is no federal law mandating that we must provide identification when asked by police.

Several states do have stop and identify statutes that require people to produce identifications if they are being legally detained. And police can only legally detain you if they have a reasonable suspicion you have committed or are about to commit a crime.

Actually it is Most States.

Sorry I never said it was a Federal Law. Guess I should have said most of us are required by law to carry ID.

You are right, you wont be Charged, but you most certainly can be detained.

It is utterly silly to be against having to prove who you are to vote. I mean you are basically coming out against Preventing Voter Fraud. It just makes no sense. Unless of course you wish to protect something. Like say Illegals voting, or Felons, or Dead people? Why else be against it. You gonna tell me the poor can not afford 45 bucks every 4 Fucking years to carry legal ID?

I got one thing to say, If you have no ID and you are poor. MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE you have NO FUCKING ID. What kind of job can you get with out showing ID, How about a bank account try getting one with out ID. Who are all these people with out ID who will not be able to vote if we pass these evil Nazi Laws requiring them to prove they are actually allowed to vote, Before they do?

Vagrancy requires more than the lack of ID.
 
VAGRANCY - A vague, poorly delineated set of minor offenses (dating from the downfall of feudalism in England, when there was an acute shortage of laborers), such as being in a condition of unemployment, wandering from place to place with no apparent purpose, and having no visible means of support. More recently, the police have utilized vagrancy statutes for arresting persons thought to have committed a crime, when lack of probable cause for the personÂ’s arrest is lacking. Vagrancy statutes have not been well received by the courts, due to their abuse, and have often been declared unconstitutional due to their vagueness, and their ignoring of due process.

The police need cause to legally detain you or ask for ID. Not having ID is not a crime in any state.

I still think a photo ID should be required to vote. If you want to own a gun you must prove you are who you say, right? Gun ownership is a Constitutional right, yet no liberals ever, ever, complain that our rights are being violated when we are required to not only prove who we are, but jump through all sorts of hoops. Tests are required, backround checks, fees, licensing, safety classes..... Yet simply asking voters to prove they are who they claim to be, well now, that's a violation of their Constitutional rights!@!

If were not going to make people prove they are allowed to vote before they do it. Then we might as well let anyone vote. Citizen or not, Felon or not, Actually alive or not. Why not if it's not important enough to verify it?

Yea, because Daffy Duck always shows up to vote. So, how much voter fraud happened in the last 5 elections. Maybe two or three from each state? And half of those by mistake?

This is just more bureaucracy Republicans, the lying sacks of shit, always say they are against, and then aren't. They are such hypocrites.

The only people that care about this issue are far-righties living in fear of illegals voting, and far-left nutjobs that want illegals to vote.

The rest of us recognize that 99% of illegal immigrants are so scared of being deported, they'd never set foot in a voting booth, and the 1% that are actually committing fraud would just go and get a fake id.

Interesting, in the state of Virginia all one needed to get a drivers license was proof of residency, (not citizenship), to register to vote was the same. Voter registration forms are available for all at all Virginia DMVs, no proof of citizenship required however I believe this may have changed since 9/11 by requiring registrants have a Social Security number.
Of course we have to realize there were no illegals prior to 9/11 so no illegals took advantage of the opening during the decades leading up to 9/11.

 Why Democrats Oppose "Voter ID" Bills - The Editor's Column - The Blog - WhosPlayin.com 

 

But our higher concern is that all eligible citizens should be voters.

Agreed, and ID laws help make sure that you are an eligible citizen when you arrive at the polls and help serve as another means of making sure your vote counts and isn't stolen or rendered meaningless by a person not legally allowed to vote. Good to know we see eye-to-eye on this.

Although most working age middle-class citizens do have drivers licenses, this is not the case for everyone

And? We're talking about a state-issued ID, not specifically a driver's license.
Requiring ID other than a valid voter registration, effectively kills the mail-in-ballot.

Please note: You do not have to show a photo ID if you are voting absentee ballot by mail or if you are a resident of a licensed nursing home and vote there. If a voter is over 65 years of age and does not have a photo ID  then the voter may vote absentee ballot by mail.

 Voter ID laws invite MORE fraud, not less 

 

records from the state Bureau of Motor Vehicles show about 8.83 million voting-age residents have an Ohio drivers license or photo ID  about 28,000 more than there are voting-age residents in the state, according to the 2010 census.

You do realize the ID will be required in addition to existing checks, right? This means these people aren't made any more able to vote illegally just by having an ID- they must still pass the other checks in existence.

In other words, the black turnout jump in North Carolina, a state without voter ID laws, was more than twice the size of the jump in Georgia, a state with stringent voter ID laws.

I'll just reply with something the author just said a moment earlier
Any good student of Statistics 101 will tell you that correlation does not imply causation...

The author didn't even consider the factors effecting turnout increases in each state. Care to try again?
 
 My Creeping Discomfort with Voter ID Laws « The Hill: Chapel Hill Political Review 

 

the law allows concealed handgun licenses as identification but not student IDs

CCP's are issued by the State of Nebraska. School IDs are not. State IDs are held to higher production standards and are harder to forge.  All individuals who apply for or renew a concealed carry permit must undergo a National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) inquiry , which means it's not only on par with other state-issued IDs, but it also demonstrated one passed the background check, meaning it'd be difficult for criminals without their 2nd amend rights restored to acquire one (and if your 2nd amend rights have not been restored, it's highly unlikely your voting rights have), which arguably makes it even better than a standard state-issued ID in that regard, by adding another level of checks.

 Jimmy Carter's Bad Call on Voter ID - NYTimes.com 

 

Voter ID is an issue that rightly sets the teeth of civil rights groups and many Democrats on edge. There is good reason to believe that the main purpose of state voter ID laws is to reduce the number of ballots cast by poor and minority voters.

Because they can't acquire a standard state-issued ID? You know, the same ID you have to show an employer when filling out tax info and proving your identity in order to get hired... the same ID you need to buy beer...

Sounds like you're claiming 'many poor and blacks' don't work or seek employment, since they can't do so without an ID to prove their identity to their employer for tax purposes.

Do you always imply such racist things? Why do you have such a bigoted view of blacks?

Thought so.

 

And just how are you going to come up with those statistics unless one can do a SSN search on all previous registrants and compare with past and active voter rolls? Hasn't happened yet.
Besides where did I say anyone specifically needed a drivers license to vote though you do have to have some form of residency validation (ID) to prove who you are in this state.

Oh and I never insinuated that the number of illegals who took advantage of the "loop hole" was large, hell I never listed any numbers whatsoever, just using something you completely lack, common sense based on a knowledge of people.

All votes should be legal, but Republicans use voter ID and voter suppression to unfairly disenfranchise poor voters.

 

Even if I manage to get two or three extra ones in ? you have to present ID to get into bars, use a credit card, register for collage, open a bank account, get a membership from Block Buster, get a library card, rent tools, get welfare, drive a car, get a toll road EZ pass, and a bunch of other things to. And most homeless shelters will help a person get a state ID. Know why ? Because you cant do anything with out one.

Including proving your identity to an employer when filling out your tax forms, which seems to imply that Democrats feel their voter base is wellfare queens with no intention of seeking legal gainful employment- which raises questions since they always speak of minorities as being this voter base at risk of disenfranchisement.

So the question is: why do Democrats feel that racial minorities, especially blacks, are wellfare queens with no intention of seeking legal gainful employment? Of course, this does explain a few things about the Democratic party...
 
 
No one is opposed to voter ID per se, the concern is that Federal law wont be followed with regard to allowing a voter without ID to complete a provisional ballot: no one may be turned away from a polling place because he has no ID.
 
 
 
All votes should be legal, but Republicans use voter ID and voter suppression to unfairly disenfranchise poor voters.

 

If you want to vote, you should be able to prove you are who you say you are...

Do the dead really vote in Chicago? Apparently so, polling day become more like Ressurrection day in that city.
Then there's the matter of that six room Ohio house that contained some twenty plus registered Democrats in 2008 or the two eight year old females in Bridgeport, CT's Marina Village that were also registered Democrats for the 2008 election.
The folks who trot out the purple inkwells for finger dipping in Iraq and Afghanistan might be onto something.

Bullshit. Democrats approve of voter fraud. They wouldn't get elected if it wasn't for the votes of dead people and illegal aliens.

No one is fooled.
 
 
There is next to none of the type of faud id will solve.

This was proven by a five year study under the Bush administration.

ID are harder to get in some areas than others and would place a higher burden on poorer areas.

The programs cost milllions to impliment.

What the right is doing is insisting on wasting tax payer dollars on fraud that doesnt exsist which will create unequal burdens on poorer voters to be able to vote.

WHY is the right pushing this?

It solves no fraud.

It costs millions and it makes it so some legal American voters will not participate in our most sacred right.

What does the right have to gain by wasting this money?

Only way to insure one man - one vote. Simple.
 
 
Making false hoops for voters to jump through based on lies is not good for our democracy
 
 
 
 
the true reason is that voter fraud is a major tool dems use to win elections !!if you have to show ID then it is easier to detect fraud!!you see the libbs don't believe in level playing fields....their victim mentality helps them to rationalize cheating at the ballot box!!to them private ownership,personal responsibility,hard work,business ect...are evils that should be defeated by any means necessary, especially cheating !!...........THANK GOODNESS THAT THEY ARE TO FEMININE AND COWARDLY TO TAKE UP ARMS!!!

 

Like DUH, it makes it harder for them to slip in illegals, and Dead people as Votes.

 

Not to mention most of em like to vote TWICE.   corrupt bastardos

Oh puhleaze. The claim the ID is difficult to get is to absurd for words. If you're too clueless to accomplish such a task, then you shouldn't be voting.

Where is this so-called "study" the Bush Administration authored? Do you think no one noticed the fact that you couldn't post a link to it? That's because it's a fiction.

Democrats support voter fraud. No one is swallowing their moronic excuses for opposing voter ID.

Ain't that the truth. If any of the radical environmentalist libs had any balls, then they would take up arms against Obaam's new EPA ruling. Instead, they are probably praying to mother earth and crying of the spotted owl.

 My Creeping Discomfort with Voter ID Laws « The Hill: Chapel Hill Political Review 

 Jimmy Carter's Bad Call on Voter ID - NYTimes.com 

 

Everyone of the excuses listed,pegs the whining meter. Dems want a connected informed voter,but somehow they can't get some form of ID along the way?? And some how all people that they say can't get one for what ever must all be democrats??

Excuses simple as that.
 
 
 
Voter ids would be fine. Give them out to people for free.
Simple as that.

 

Do you know how hard it is to for the disenfrachised to walk to the mailbox ? Then have to open a letter...sheesh.
 
 
 
 
Actually, I don't really care, either way. I think it's just more bullshit, and won't really affect anything anyway.

 

I can't fathom how anyone could not Care that you can currently Vote on this country with out proving who you are. I mean come on. That is the first step in preventing fraud. If were not going to make people prove they are allowed to vote before they do it. Then we might as well let anyone vote. Citizen or not, Felon or not, Actually alive or not. Why not if it's not important enough to verify it?

I mean jesus.

 

If most felons, illegals, dead people and poor people voted Republican, the Dems would be screaming for strict ID laws.
 
 
 
I have always had to show I.D. to vote in Oklahoma, Texas, Virginia, Alabama, Washington D.C. and Misouri.

 

Kind of busy on election day, huh? Care to share some frequent flier miles?
 
 
 
 
 
Yea, because Daffy Duck always shows up to vote. So, how much voter fraud happened in the last 5 elections. Maybe two or three from each state? And half of those by mistake?

This is just more bureaucracy Republicans, the lying sacks of shit, always say they are against, and then aren't. They are such hypocrites.

 

Interesting, in the state of Virginia all one needed to get a drivers license was proof of residency, (not citizenship), to register to vote was the same. Voter registration forms are available for all at all Virginia DMVs, no proof of citizenship required however I believe this may have changed since 9/11 by requiring registrants have a Social Security number.
Of course we have to realize there were no illegals prior to 9/11 so no illegals took advantage of the opening during the decades leading up to 9/11.  

 

Many poor and blacks don't have a driver's licence. That's the point.

Do you have statistics on how many illegals vote? Who they vote for?

Thought so.

 

So maybe they could show their welfare check or food stamp card? Come now! "Poor" people had to prove they were eligible to receive handouts from taxpayers, didn't they?

It is still a different standard. Everyone shows ID when they register. I showed ID 20 years ago when I registered in my town. Now, someone who votes in person has to provide proof while the ever increasing numbers of absentee voters just mail in a ballot.

It would be interesting how it stands up in court

Personally, I would like to see a national ID that you can use to vote, drivers license, bank card, credit card, health insurance ID......you carry one card in your wallet

‘Voter fraud’ is clearly a non-issue, a contrivance of the right.

 
Among those sampled, only two county prosecutors—both in Minnesota—report that they investigated complaints of voter fraud in 2004 or 2005.
These resulted in the investigation of 11 people,
seven in County A and four people in County B.

The cases in County B were dismissed, and the seven people accused of illegal voting in County A were not prosecuted (they were sent warning letters). There were 1,238,021 ballots counted in the 2004 election in the sample counties, yielding
a voter-fraud rate of zero when considering convictions, and a 0.0000088 percent rate if counting investigations.

The data on voter fraud in the states with the most convenient registration rules suggest that liberalized registration procedures on their own do not cause voter fraud, nor do they compromise voter roll security.

 http://www.demos.org/pubs/EDRVF.pdf 

 

There is no evidence, therefore, that voter fraud is rampant, much less an issue. Mandatory voter ID laws and similar measures are unwarranted, particularly in the context of legitimate voters being discouraged to vote.

Voter ID requirements are consequently about conservative partisan politics, not the integrity of elections.

 
They should have their rights restored once their time is served.

And that includes to right to bear arms.

 

That’s going to be a tough sell and difficult to address in the courts. In Heller the Court states restricting gun sales to felons did not violate the Constitutional right to own a firearm, nor does it conflict with the right to self-defense.

Republicans like Vote by Mail voters...

 Los Angeles   Republicans, meanwhile, while numerically fewer by half, vote by mail in a higher proportion than Democrats. The latest figures available, as of June 27, show GOP registration at 1.02 million, with some about 276,527 registered as permanent mail voters  or about 27 percent, or 8 percent higher than Democrats, said county elections official Eileen Shea.
 COLUMBUS, Ohio   A higher percentage of Republicans than Democrats in Ohio's three largest counties have asked for absentee ballots this year --

Because Democrats need voter fraud to win.

That's the only reason to be against showing a picture ID when you vote.

I mean, I witnessed Democrat ops taking a whole busload of "mentally disabled" adults into the voting place in 2002.

See post 101 and cite objective evidence in rebuttal, otherwise your statement is false.

Since there is no voter fraud neither party needs it to win nor advocate for legislation to address it.

What evidence do I have?

Acorn ops getting arrested for registering Mary Poppins, getting kicked out of ohio, and the Demcrat attempt to repeal Voter ID going down to flaming defeat.

 
On April 6 the  Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now  (ACORN), that is, the organization itself as opposed to its employees, was convicted in Las Vegas of felony compensation for registration of voters. Sentencing is scheduled for August 10. Nevada forbids compensating voter registration canvassers because it creates a financial incentive for fraudulent or sloppy registrations.

Significantly, this is the first time ACORN itself has been convicted of a crime. The fact that the nonprofit entity was found guilty strongly suggests that ACORNs ambitious voter-fraud schemes were sanctioned at the highest levels.

The conviction came after the 2008 election cycle during which Las Vegas  ACORN  officials emptied the local jails to fill voter registration canvasser slots and even put individuals convicted of identity theft in charge of the registration drive. At least they hired experts, some locals quipped, according to John Fund of the Wall Street Journal.

Mickey Mouse, Mary Poppins and celebrities living and dead have been registered to vote over and over again precisely because ACORN has been allowed to get away with polluting the nations voter rolls for so long.

But this is not the first time that ACORN has found itself in legal hot water. In 2010 ACORN settled a racketeering lawsuit in Ohio out of court and agreed to withdraw from the state. In the settlement with the Buckeye Institutes 1851 Center for Constitutional Law, ACORN agreed to cease all Ohio activity and surrender all its state business licenses.

As Judicial Watch reports, The group has been busted for forging voter registration applications in key battleground states and submitting falsified forms in more than half a dozen others. In 2007, ACORN settled the largest case of voter fraud in the history of Washington State after seven workers were caught submitting about 2,000 fake registration forms. Moreover, there are scores of ACORN employees who have been convicted of election fraud.

 

 ACORN Convicted In Massive Voter Fraud Conspiracy, Legacy Media Yawns | NewsReal Blog 

This is why the "election reform" of 2005 went down to FLAMING DEFEAT! Because Ohio voters were quite aware of Acorn's actions on behalf of the Democrat party.

Election reform measures defeated in Ohio

The liberal excuse makers claim that the voters "wanted" election reform, but the reform on the ballot was "badly written."

BS! The reason it was defeated, is voters knew it was a way to get around voter ID.

Good question, you've provided none so far.

Again, see the data in post 101, thats the evidence you need to address.

You need to cite evidence where voter fraud, when removed from election results, actually changed the outcome of a given election.

And citing ACORN as evidence of voter fraud only supports the fact that such fraud is statistically irrelevant and non-existent.

Registration is not voting. It is the responsibility of local registrars to validate registration. Not just throw out Micky Mouse but verify residency, legal age and that they are not registered elsewhere

ACORN registered voters and it was not their job to throw out invalid registrations
 
 
 
 
 
Voter ids would be fine. Give them out to people for free. I am also in favor of making voting mandatory and getting rid of the electoral college. Simple majorities should decide the Presidential election. No conservative is in favor of either.

Simple as that.

 

Propose a Constitutional amendment. I'll abide by that. In the mean time, you abide by present law, OK?

 

I'll abide by the Constitution.

 
Amendment 15 - Race No Bar to Vote. Ratified 2/3/1870. History

1. The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.

2. The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.

24 - Poll Tax Barred. Ratified 1/23/1964. History

1. The right of citizens of the United States to vote in any primary or other election for President or Vice President, for electors for President or Vice President, or for Senator or Representative in Congress, shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any State by reason of failure to pay any poll tax or other tax.

Frankly, have you heard the opinions of people who don't live and breathe this stuff like we do? Most of them are profoundly ignorant of government and how it works, and would probably take the a vote for the presidency about as seriously as they take a vote for who should win American Idol.

I'm actually happy the people who don't care enough to even try to figure out what is going on don't participate. Who knows what kind of horrible results we might have.

All votes should be legal, but Republicans use voter ID and voter suppression to unfairly disenfranchise poor voters.

 

what the fuck does voter ID have to do with voter suppression?? the truth of the matter is that you know if voter ID is mandatory your party the party of liars and gays will lose hundreds of thousands of votes!! and conservative voters don't have a problem with voter ID!!i'll bet you are also against keeping the voting places open 3hrs later so that it would be more convenient for hard working Americans to vote!!
 
 
 
September 29, 2010
A hundred years ago, the average life expectancy in the United States was 47 years. In 2009, the federal government recently announced that it is 78 years. And, now, in an age when NASA has machines roving Mars, many states are extending the voting life of citizens for years after they are medically pronounced dead. There are 116,000 dead eligible voters in Massachusetts. And in Florida, one major newspaper recently investigated and reported that almost 15,000 dead Floridians are still hanging around on the election rolls - just six weeks before one of the most vicious and important election cycles in our history. Can it be the sun? Most States have similar statistics.

Every two years, states must report to the federal Election Assistance Commission (EAC) information about the integrity and accuracy of their voter rolls. The latest report is not good news for our democracy - or our international reputation. South Dakota, Texas, Kentucky, Mississippi and Indiana report in excess of a dozen counties with more registered voters than breathing human beings old enough to vote. West Virginia, Maryland, Iowa and North Carolina also reported having eligible deceased voters on their rolls. The list goes on and on. And so does the real risk that these voters will have illegal votes registered in their names. Close races, like the Franken/Coleman race in Minnesota can be decided on just a handful of votes.  Alarming Vote Fraud Statistics 

 

True or False?
 
 
 
 
 
When did I complain that requiring ID disenfranchises anyone? You're arguing with yourself.

 

The entire thread is about the requirement to provide ID to vote. You are arguing that one does not need ID.

 

Really? Where did I argue that? Link to the post, please.

 
So lets cut to the chase shall we? Do you support or oppose the requirement for ID to be shown when voting?

 

Actually, I don't really care, either way. I think it's just more bullshit, and won't really affect anything anyway.

 

this thread is excellent for exposing the liberal mind set!!
 
 
Wow, a problem plaguing us, resolved by people working together for the common good. Imagine that.

The Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment Act (or MOVE Act) is Subtitle H of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (H.R. 2647, Pub.L. 111-84, 123 Stat. 2190.) and was signed into law in the United States signed by President Barack Obama on October 28, 2009. The overall purpose of the law is to help military serving overseas and citizens who live abroad vote in U.S. elections. Most provisions apply to the November 2010 elections. A notable exception is the requirement (in Subsection E) that requires states to allow "a UOCAVA voter to enter his/her address or other information relevant to the local election jurisdiction and receive a list of all candidates for Federal office in that jurisdiction".[1]

the true reason is that voter fraud is a major tool dems use to win elections !!if you have to show ID then it is easier to detect fraud!!you see the libbs don't believe in level playing fields....their victim mentality helps them to rationalize cheating at the ballot box!!to them private ownership,personal responsibility,hard work,business ect...are evils that should be defeated by any means necessary, especially cheating !!...........THANK GOODNESS THAT THEY ARE TO FEMININE AND COWARDLY TO TAKE UP ARMS!!!

 

how many years have you served your country in the military?

 

7 whats your point ??
 
 
 
 
 
Yea, because Daffy Duck always shows up to vote. So, how much voter fraud happened in the last 5 elections. Maybe two or three from each state? And half of those by mistake?

This is just more bureaucracy Republicans, the lying sacks of shit, always say they are against, and then aren't. They are such hypocrites.

 

Interesting, in the state of Virginia all one needed to get a drivers license was proof of residency, (not citizenship), to register to vote was the same. Voter registration forms are available for all at all Virginia DMVs, no proof of citizenship required however I believe this may have changed since 9/11 by requiring registrants have a Social Security number.
Of course we have to realize there were no illegals prior to 9/11 so no illegals took advantage of the opening during the decades leading up to 9/11.  

 

Many poor and blacks don't have a driver's licence. That's the point.

Do you have statistics on how many illegals vote? Who they vote for?

Thought so.

 

THE BLACKS AGAIN!! WHAT A SURPRISE!!

I am going to make a leap here and give everyone the benefit of the doubt that nobody here has ever worked as a poll watcher?

Yes/no, state your case and share some of your experiences please.

Because humans can not be trusted to be honest. It sucks, but its the way it is.

Often, no translators, other than those brought in by a particular group. Too many Languages to cope with.
 
 
 
I am also in favor of making voting mandatory

 

Force the ignorant masses who don't know or care enough to voten force them to tell mus whose names they recognize from tv and choose the president based on that?

Are you stupid?

 
I support voter ID if it is provided free to voters and I can get an ID at any post office, supermarket or drugstore

 

Walgreens giving out legal government documentation?

Are you stupid? Do you know why we have a government agency in charge of standardized identification?

Why do you want to undermine our methods of identifying drivers, voters, and buyers of booze and guns unless you want to encourage illegal activity?

 
Charging someone for an ID to vote is a defacto poll tax

 

 

All the anti-ID arguments were debunked in post 40. Rdean's racist view of blacks was exposed in post 41.

Since then, all the pro-fraud crowd has done is repeat themselves and insist it's everyone else who's racist. They have no argument. The discussion is over. Unless they can actually come up with an intelligent argument, replying to the pro-frauders any further would just be feeding the trolls.

No. We're not going to go chase down everyone lacking to will to vote and shove a ballot in their face. Should we also knock on people's doors and ask if they want to take a driving test?

Why are you so eager to enable the theft of legitimate votes from citizens?

It is settled. The anti-IDers want only to disenfranchise citizens by rendering their votes moot through the fraud they seek to enable. They hate the American people and want to use illegals (whom they manipulate through their various racial agendas and rhetoric) as a tool to override the will of the citizenry and push their own ends, in the hopes of stifling legitimate debate and political competition, thereby elevating their party to the de facto single ruling party.

Scratch one of them and you find a Bolshevik...

No. We're not going to go chase down everyone lacking to will to vote and shove a ballot in their face. Should we also knock on people's doors and ask if they want to take a driving test?

Why are you so eager to enable the theft of legitimate votes from citizens?

It is settled. The anti-IDers want only to disenfranchise citizens by rendering their votes moot through the fraud they seek to enable. They hate the American people and want to use illegals (whom they manipulate through their various racial agendas and rhetoric) as a tool to override the will of the citizenry and push their own ends, in the hopes of stifling legitimate debate and political competition, thereby elevating their party to the de facto single ruling party.

Scratch one of them and you find a Bolshevik...

 

You have a constitutional right to vote. We should make it as easy as possible for citizens to cast their vote. If you want to make additional ID requirements you have to make getting an ID as accessible as possible.

What do you fear? Americans actually voting?

You have a constitutional right to vote. We should make it as easy as possible for citizens to cast their vote.

 

Should we give everyone a bullhorn so they can easily practice their right to speech? Should everyone get their own tv show?

Should we buy everyone a gun?

Should we buy everyone a safe?

 
If you want to make additional ID requirements you have to make getting an ID as accessible as possible.

 

They already do

 
What do you fear? Americans actually voting?

 

They already can. ID laws help protect that right by preventing people like you from stealing their votes by rendering them invalid with ballots cast by illegals in the names of dead people. You're the one who wants to disenfranchise legal voters. Why do you fear having Americans' votes count?

Why not? Why not go door to door to register people to vote? If you demand ID, why make it harder to get ID? Why not vote from home on your computer?

What do Conservatives fear about Americans voting?
 
 
Perhaps everyone should be required to vote?
 
 
 
 
 
I can't fathom how anyone could not Care that you can currently Vote on this country with out proving who you are. I mean come on. That is the first step in preventing fraud. If were not going to make people prove they are allowed to vote before they do it. Then we might as well let anyone vote. Citizen or not, Felon or not, Actually alive or not. Why not if it's not important enough to verify it?

I mean jesus.

 

If most felons, illegals, dead people and poor people voted Republican, the Dems would be screaming for strict ID laws.

 

Felons should have their rights restored after they served their time. I don't care who they would vote for.

 

can't vote can you Swallows??

I've used a pistol permit as ID at the polls. Damned liberal bitch told me it wasn't valid until I explained the permit required verification of residence, citizenship and an FBI background check. She checked with the supervisor who confirmed the permit was acceptable.

Sounds like a good reason to have a single clear rule: state- or military-issued identification only. Eliminate all confusion and apply a single, simple standard based on what's already accepted for all other government purposes.

He thinks his causes should be easy and mine hard. He imediately assumes that since I'm Conservative, that I want to limit someone's right to vote. DEAD ASS WRONG! I want everyone who is eligible to vote, to vote. What I don't want is even one vote from a person who is not eligible.
He can't figure out that obtaining an ID is something responsible adults do. I mean, how can you function in society without identification? You can't get a job, pay a bill with anything but cash, hell, you can't even be qualified for assistance or cash your welfare check without ID.
Voting is a right, yes, but it doesn't take precedence over any other right.

Who ARE these people the left claims have no ID's? Unless they are living off the grid, involved in strictly cash businesses like drugs and prostitution or have unlimited cash stuffed in their mattresses, they can't survive in today's society.

Its good you refused to break voter law on principle - rather than fear of getting caught.
 
 
 
Every one of us is required by law to carry ID. Even if you do not drive you still are suppose to carry a State ID card.

 

By what law?
 
 
 
It is FEDERAL law that every Federal election the voters be verified as being legally allowed to vote. FEDERAL LAW. Except ID, how does one VERIFY if someone is legally whom they claim to be and legally allowed to vote?

 

A single ID is not sufficient. I believe first we need live film of their birth and sworn testimony from the doctor that delivered them - AND 2 forms of ID and a thumb print. Without this as a minimum, we cannot be absolutely sure they are even citizens - let alone eligible to vote in a given precinct.

You don't want non-citizens voting, right?

Updated August 8, 2011

Introduction

Thirty states require all voters to show ID before voting at the polls. In 14 of these, the ID must include a photo of the voter; in the remaining 16, non-photo forms of ID are acceptable. Voter ID laws can be broken down into the three following categories:

Strict Photo ID (7 states): Voters must show a photo ID in order to vote. Voters who are unable to show photo ID at the polls are permitted to vote a provisional ballot, which is counted only if the voter returns to election officials within several days after the election to show a photo ID. At the beginning of 2011, there were just two states--Georgia and Indiana--with strict photo ID laws. Two states--Kansas and Wisconsin--passed new strict photo ID laws this year, and three states with non-photo ID laws--South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas--amended them to make them strict photo ID laws. None of these new laws is in effect yet, although they likely will be before the 2012 elections. See the notes below Table 1 for more information regarding effective dates for new legislation.
Photo ID (7 states): Voters are asked to show a photo ID in order to vote. Voters who are unable to show photo ID are still allowed to vote if they can meet certain other critieria. In some states, a voter with ID can vouch for a voter without. Other states ask a voter without ID to provide personal information such as a birth date, or sign an affidavit swearing to his or her identity. Voters without ID are not required to return to election officials after the election and show a photo ID in order to have their ballots counted in the manner that voters without ID in the strict photo ID states are. The seven states with photo ID laws are Alabama, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Louisiana, Michigan and South Dakota.
Non-Photo ID (16 states): All voters must show ID at the polls. The list of acceptable IDs is varied and includes options that do not have a photo, such as a utility bill or bank statement with the voter's name and address.
 Voter ID: State Requirements 
 
 
 
 
Every one of us is required by law to carry ID. Even if you do not drive you still are suppose to carry a State ID card.

 

By what law?

 

There is no Federal Law demanding that. However, if you are Driving, you Must have your License with you, Boarding certain Public Transport, Etc. If you Misrepresent who you are, it is a Crime, False Identification. If you are caught committing a Crime, or Suspect, or matching a Description of a Suspect, you can be booked, and held 24+ hours, not including Weekends and Holiday's. If you are in the sticks, ID is one thing. If you are in an over crowded City, or Traveling, it's another. Why set yourself up for trouble?
 
 
 
 
It is FEDERAL law that every Federal election the voters be verified as being legally allowed to vote. FEDERAL LAW. Except ID, how does one VERIFY if someone is legally whom they claim to be and legally allowed to vote?

nah.... just one valid ID will do!!

$20.00 ID card is easier.

 

ID cards are also foolproof. No one ever got into a bar with a fake ID, and I'm sure temporary poll workers with a couple hours training are much better at spotting fakes than bar bouncers who have done the same thing every night for years.

Why just $20.00? That would eliminate too few poor voters. The poll tax should be at least $100. And we'll add a competency test that the poll workers get to make up as they go along.

You really want to make it way too easy to vote.

No lie. That's what I'm talking about. Anyone who can't produce the doctor that birthed them to testify they were born a citizen shouldn't be allowed to vote. I want 100% proof. ID's are WAY to easy to fake!

Well then why require a license to drive ? And fir the $20.00 comment, that's just silly. Few in this country are so poor that they dont have that much money, and many churches and homeless shelters will help those who cant afford it get one.
 
 
I think California voters should be required to do the exact same things that are required of gun owners in California:

1) Attend an education class and pass a written test.
2) A 10 day waiting period.
3) Show Clear evidence of identity and age" which is defined as a valid, non-expired California Driver's License or Identification Card issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles.
4) Show Proof of California residency, such as a utility bill, residential lease, property deed, or government-issued identification (other than a drivers license or other DMV-issued identification).
5) A "personal firearms eligibility" background check.

Then and only then would you be registered to vote. I think the "written test" portion would flip the state from blue to red alone.....
 
 
 
 
 
if you can't prove who you are you should not be able vote!!

 

No lie. That's what I'm talking about. Anyone who can't produce the doctor that birthed them to testify they were born a citizen shouldn't be allowed to vote. I want 100% proof. ID's are WAY to easy to fake!

 

Well then why require a license to drive ? And fir the $20.00 comment, that's just silly. Few in this country are so poor that they dont have that much money, and many churches and homeless shelters will help those who cant afford it get one.

 

That's the problem. If only several hundred thousand people have to go looking for a cash handout so they can exercise their "right" to vote - then what's the point? We need to eliminate poor voters altogether. They don't pay taxes - why should they get to vote? $100 should be the MINIMUM poll tax. Any less would be un -american
 
 
 
I think California voters should be required to do the exact same things that are required of gun owners in California:

 

I agree. Those living in liberal states should have far more roadblocks placed between them and the polls. Why just gun owners? They should get that check - plus an FBI background check and a chauffer's license,

On the other hand - if a white conservative voter walks into the voting location without their ID - but the poll worker knows who they are - that's OK.

Or work for two hours, or save up there soda cans or what ever. $20.00 is not hard to come by.

So people who know poll workers personally should get special treatment - regardless of skin color. Got it.

Sort of like the way absentee ballots cast by people who died before the election get tossed out in most states - they don't - unless the deceased is someone well known, then the poll workers know to throw out their ballot. (we fixed that problem in Louisiana by simply passing a law that allows absentees cast by folks who died b4 the election day to be counted)

Why the fuck should the poll tax be only $20? How are we going to pay for tax cuts for the rich with a poll tax that low?

I say $100. That's not that hard to come by, either.

The thread is not about a poll tax. Its about requiring voters to dhow state ID in order to vote..

A single state ID? What good would that do? People fake Id's to do less nefarious things than voter fraud all the time.

I think two forms of Id and a thumb print should be the minimum.

Well if the poor are getting food stamps its not an issue because they can register to vote and since ID is required to get benefits they would have everything they need to vote if it required ID.

Identification such as a drivers license, state ID, birth certificate or alien card;
Proof of income such as pay stubs, Social Security, SSI or a pension for each member of your household;
Proof of how much you spend for child care;
Rent receipts or proof of your mortgage payments;
Records of your utility costs; and
Medical bills for those members of your household age 60 or older, and for those who receive government payments such as Social Security or SSI because they are disabled.

the true reason is that voter fraud is a major tool dems use to win elections !!if you have to show ID then it is easier to detect fraud!!you see the libbs don't believe in level playing fields....their victim mentality helps them to rationalize cheating at the ballot box!!to them private ownership,personal responsibility,hard work,business ect...are evils that should be defeated by any means necessary, especially cheating !!...........THANK GOODNESS THAT THEY ARE TO FEMININE AND COWARDLY TO TAKE UP ARMS!!!

This all sounds too much like literacy tests that they had in the South to keep blacks from voting.

I think that the ID law is a good idea because it will prevent fraud. But it shouldn't be punative.
 
 
I am hearing all these charges of racism and voter suppression coming from the left on the voter ID topic.....if whites and conservatives are also required to have a valid ID where is the problem!!the libbs want fraud [affirmative voting ]at the ballot box!!they are basically admitting and applauding voter fraud!!

I didn't say that, you did, I just responded with an equally idiotic assertion using your words to prove a point which you obviously missed. But hey, whatchagonna do?

I find it odd that Leftists / Liberals have no problem making it difficult for law abiding citizens to exercise their Constitutional RIGHT to keep and bear arms - yet simply asking voters to prove their identity before voting sends them into apoplectic fits of hysteria.

only people on the fraudulent left get upset over showing ID at the voting booth.
 
 
2012 will set the bar for voter fraud !!
