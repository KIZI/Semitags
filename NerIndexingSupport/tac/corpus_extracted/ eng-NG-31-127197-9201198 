Mann Coulter has convinced Palm Beach officials to removed her home
address from county property records.

Seems like the political pundit has been had one too many people come
and harass her at home.

She had one lovely greeting card dropped off, which read, "The only
things left after a nuclear war are you and cockroaches" and had "Go
fuck yourself" printed on its face.

Another visitor wasn't as polite and started shouting "Ann Coulter is
a big asshole" from outside her house.

Since the writers are striking, they should come up with more clever
things to say outside Mann's home!

P.S. Coulter turns 46 in two weeks.

Happy birthday! You're almost 50!
