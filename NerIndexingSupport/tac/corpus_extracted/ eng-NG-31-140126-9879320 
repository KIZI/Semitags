CAMERON TELLS TEAM HE'S COMING BACK

Though everyone expects Fins coach Cam Cameron to be fired, a league
source tells us that Cameron told the team after Sunday's season-
ending loss to the Bengals that he'll return as the team's coach in
2008.

(Hey, we thought that teams were no longer serving alcohol in the
locker room.)

Even if by some miracle Bill Parcells decides not to fire Cameron,
there's no way that Cameron knew it at any point on Sunday.  Unless,
of course, Parcells lied to Cameron in order to loosen him up.

Either way, the Cameron termination watch is officially on.

IRELAND "DEFINITELY" GETTING FINS' GIG

The same source that told us that Dolphins G.M. Randy Mueller
"definitely" will be fired tells us that Cowboys V.P. of college and
pro scouting "definitely" will be installed as the new General Manager
in Miami.

Despite reports that the Cowboys might try to delay the move until
after the 2008 draft, the reality is that, if Ireland is getting final
say over personnel, the Dolphins can immediately hire him.

And because Bill Parcells' contract makes clear the fact that he
doesn't have final say, it's highly unlikely that the Cowboys will be
able to block the move.  Though no one believes that Parcells won't
exert authority over Ireland, how is that any different than the
authority than the owner has over his staff?

Like any other G.M., Ireland will have final say.  And there will be
times where he might use it at his own peril.

We're also hearing rumblings that Mueller has already been fired.
Stay tuned.
