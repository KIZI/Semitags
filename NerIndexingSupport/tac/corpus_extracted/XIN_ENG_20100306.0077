Nigeria recorded 66 million tons of cargo in 2009, a top official with the
Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) has said.

The figure was one million tons higher than that of 2008, Abdulsalam Mohamed,
managing director of NPA, disclosed this at a news conference in Lagos on
Friday.

He said the record, which excluded crude oil, was attained despite the global
economic recession affecting ports worldwide.

"In the last 10 years, we have witnessed a progressive increase in cargo
throughput, he added.

Mohammed said Nigerian ports were doing appreciably well because in 1999, the
ports handled 44 million tones of cargo.

According to the official, in 2010, the organization had projected a 10 percent
increase in its revenue.

"But the greatest challenge for NPA is the banking crisis that has impeded banks
from   making credit facilities available to importers,"he added.

"However, in some ways, the recession provided opportunities for trading nations
like Nigeria to thrive in terms of prices of international goods and charter
rates that had gone down," he told reporters.

The NPA chief also made some clarifications on the newly introduced Cargo
Tracking Note (CTN) scheme.

He said the objective of government introducing the scheme was to enhance the
security of the maritime industry.

Mohammed said maritime nations felt it was necessary to obtain advance
information on cargoes as well as the vessels and the personnel conveying them.

"This is just like the international maritime community, which came up with the
International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISDS) code after the Sept. 11,
2001 terrorist attack in the U.S., " he said.

There is need to track and have adequate information relating to cargo and ship
movements, he said.
