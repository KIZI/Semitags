Detectives investigating the case of a student at the
University of California, Los Angeles, who allegedly slashed the throat of a
female classmate have still not discovered what prompted the violence,
according to law-enforcement sources.

Investigators on Friday said they are continuing to examine the
background of the suspect, Damon Thompson, 20, but nothing so far points to
a motive for what sources called an unprovoked attack that stunned the UCLA
campus.

The victim is recovering at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center after
emergency surgery. UCLA officials said they were awaiting her permission to
release her identity and that students were buoyed Friday by reports that
she is out of extreme danger.

UCLA released the following statement on behalf of the victim's family:
"The 20-year-old victim of (Thursday's) stabbing on the UCLA campus is
showing signs of improvement, and her surgeons expect a good result as she
continues to heal. Her parents wish to express their thanks to everyone for
their concern, and also wish to extend their gratitude to the police and
emergency responders and appreciation to the UCLA medical team for the
excellent medical care she is receiving at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical
Center."

Thompson and the victim were seniors, and some witnesses said they
believed they were lab partners.

Thompson is an only child who left his mother's home in Belize in
Central America two years ago to attend UCLA. He frequently stayed at his
relatives' home in Fontana.

On Friday, those relatives were in disbelief that the young man could
commit such a violent act. Thompson's second cousin, Akilah Williams, 17,
said she was shocked when she heard the news.

"He cares about what people think about him too much," Williams said.
"He gets stressed out, but that doesn't mean he'd do something
crazy."

Thompson is accused of slashing the neck of a 20-year-old woman Thursday
in a UCLA chemistry lab. The attack on the sixth floor of Young Hall
prompted swift police mobilization. Thompson, who was arrested inside Young
Hall minutes after the attack, was booked on suspicion of attempted
murder.

Williams described Thompson as mellow though sometimes "snooty" about
his possessions. The only complaint about her cousin, she said, was that he
occasionally raided their refrigerator.

"He would eat everything," she said. "I mean everything."

Thompson had no other family in the United States, so he spent school
breaks, including all of last summer, at the home of his mother's
cousin.

Relatives said they had never seen their cousin become violent.

"He was even nice to my dog, Doc," said Jabari Williams, 16, another
cousin.

Thompson is expected to be arraigned next week. It's unclear whether he
has retained an attorney.
