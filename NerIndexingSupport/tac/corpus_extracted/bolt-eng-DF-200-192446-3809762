 http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/arti...ent-world.html 

Sad that you'd maybe be inclined to agree after the past few days.... it's a shame. Oh hope none of this has put off people coming for the olympics next year though! It's not all of our youths
 
 
This incident may be bad, but that's only because we are comparing it to our 'modern society' with our systems etc.

I guarantee you will see much worse in other countries but i'm on my phone so can't specifically be assed to go around sites atm. But they won't 'look as bad' because the country will be used to it/used to much worse and things such as that.
 
 
Several other countries are far more familiar with riots than England is...Northern Ireland aside which is obviously a special case, there have been mindless riots- 2 major ones- in the last 10 years here in Dublin and places like Germany and several other European countries own and use water cannons. This is something that most countries face at least once, and not all riots are borne out of an actual reason.
 
 
Unpleasant maybe, violent no. Think of the French rioters of a few years ago, or parts of some American cities.

Good. I don't blame people thinking that British youth are scum. In many circumstances, it is true.
 
 
 
 
 
No, Looks at Mexican youth, Then come back and tell me British are the worst.

Aren't you the person who was a known rioter? A few people said someone with your username was part of the riotings and lootings. Disgusting.
 
 
It's just because rioting in this country is so uncommon that it seems more extreme... just look at France! They riot so much it's practically a national hobby so it doesn't look as bad when the teenagers get involved.
 
 
and the overreation of the year goes to....the DM!!!

the rioting is bad, there's no denying that but not all of us are like that it's a select misguided few. still, even they are not the most violent.
 
 
Hahaha lol daily mail strikes again!

****ing idiots!
 
 
I'm nice  
 
 
People bash on the British youth an awful lot, but after living in America for five years, I'd much rather deal with "chavvy yobs" (hate those terms) than an average American teen.

I think that man is trying to make a name for himself as a political/social pundit by jumping in on the trend of youth bashing.
 
 
More like 1% are violent and unpleasant - from experience I would say most young people are very normal and don't do anything majorly wrong!
 
 
Poland?
Russia?
Serbia?
 
 
Considering that Mr. Anthony Daniels has worked in numerous UK prisons, how much has he done to discourage this sort of anti-social youth behaviour here?

Has he seen the kind of violence perpetrated by many youths in Brazil, Russia, Mexico, South Africa, Guatemala, or El Salvador?
 
 
Go into our inner cities, and then tell me he is wrong.

Sounds pretty accurate, scum breed scum, and there is ALOT of scum in this country.

i lolled. hard. :')
 
 
If we're the worst, then I doubt I'll ever need to worry about any youth crime anywhere internationally again.

They oviously haven't seen Ross Kemp on Gangs
 
 
Mmhm. Right.

Well, given the choice between the worse parts of Manchester, London and Birmingham, and the worse parts of Detroit, Baltimore and New Orleans, I know which I'm taking.

Still, reason no. 43,821 not to read the Daily Mail.

He/she was just baiting you(probably making it up), don't rise to it.

As for the main question, I have to agree; the youth of this country are a disgrace compared with much of Europe.
 
 
I feel honoured. What a prestigious accolade.

Let's be clear it is not British rather English. The Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish have proved time and time again to be civilized. There is something fundamentally wrong with the English youths. It is true, youths in England are deeply vile, unpleasent and violent. One only has to look on here, on tsr to see such things.

The rioting started and ended in England. The rioting occured in England and England only. It sums up what is wrong with England and it's youth population.
 
 
What?! Whoever thought of this is stupider than any violent youth.
 
 
 
Hahaha lol daily mail strikes again!

****ing idiots!

 

Even though it is not the Daily Mail saying it, they are actually specifically quoting another person, Dr Anthony Daniels? How does simply reporting the informed opinion of a renowned doctor-writer reflect badly on a newspaper?

I don't agree with the statement 'the most unpleasant in the world', but probably some of the most unpleasant in the developed world. These riots are testament to that fact.
 
 
If anyone calls me violent and unpleasent, I'll ****ing nut them.
 
 
 
Good. I don't blame people thinking that British youth are scum. In many circumstances, it is true.

 

First time I agree with you.
 
 
 
If anyone calls me violent and unpleasent, I'll ****ing nut them.

 

You're not a youth, so it doesn't apply to you.

what film is that, in your sig?

To be honest that paper is taking a very biased point of view, the youths that were robbing the shops, majority of whom properly aren't what a typical British youth is.
 
 
 
You're not a youth, so it doesn't apply to you.

 

 
 
 
I think that's nonsense.
Looking at the youth of our country and then looking at the youths in other countries that have more poverty and corruption and crime, I think that's silly
 
 
I think that the rest of the world thinks that we are all posh,so I that's why everyone is so shocked at the riots.
 
 
 
**** off.

This incident may be bad, but that's only because we are comparing it to our 'modern society' with our systems etc.

Can u imagine been mocked by nations that nearly everyone in their countries have guns *cough* America.
 
 
So, going by these completely incidental generalisations, I'm now technically perceived as being more hardcore and violent than gun-running drug mule teenagers in South America, war children in certain parts of Africa, and gang members in all parts of North America, all because a bunch of yobs threw some bricks, started a few fires, and stole some iPhones? Interesting.

Exactly, it isn't sensible to start comparing youths around the world. We need a sense of perspective here. I think the standard here is pretty low, but to say we're the most violent in the world is just silly.
 
 
 
No I ****ing wasn't. Who the hell ever said that?

 

Loads of people did   Can't believe you are denying it. There was even a pic posted of you with some looted item i think!!

I agree that a lot of the youth in this country are terrible but it's not like we're the only country with these problems. In the USA there are more black youths in prison than in college, due to their terrible gang culture.

I think it's shocked the rest of the world because the British are not seen as the type to do this kind of thing. However, in reality we're as bad as the rest of the Western world when it comes to problematic youths.
 
 
Britain?

England, they mean.  
 
 
what about the youths who ganaged up against the rioters to protect their shops and areas?? I know in my area hundreds of youths were protecting the religious places for the past two days. And the rioters are a MINORITY of the youth population anyway, they just travel from one area to the next to get more free stuff. The rioters are sick and demented people but the whole youth population should not be blamed
 
 
If any country where weed is not legal, there will always be violent and unpleasant youths.
 
 
From my experience British youths are definitely towards the lower end of the pile but not the worst.
 
 
only in the Uk can someone wearing £100 trainers and using £300 smart phones to organise their opportunistic sticky fingery claim poverty as the cause.

i dont think we're the most violent youths in the world though, how about Albania, South Africa, Mexico, any city in the states with a housing project and a gang problem, El Salvidor, did i say mexico yet? they should get 2 mentions for sheer body count, 30,000 dead since 2006, not far from matching the body count of vietnam,and their not even at war.

Possibly the only people who could claim we are that violent and unpleasant are the good people of Iraq and Afghanistahn, a sizeable portion of our youth did totally steam into their country and start wars, guess thats pretty violent and unpleasant, but they were just following orders though right?
 
 
Well apparently 99% of teenagers in London haven't committed a crime. I obviously cannot extend this to the rest of England (why they're saying British when the riots were only in England I'll never know) but that means 99% of the teenagers in London are not violent or criminal (can't comment on unpleasant as that changes with personal taste). I think said nations should look at themselves first before they pass judgement.

Though I agree on this occasion it is wrong to use British to explain these riots I must point out that Northern Irish youths are know to riot too and I say this as someone from there. I'm also sure there are bad Scottish and Welsh youths too. I'm not deeply vile or violent but maybe you'll try and claim that because I'm half Irish and it some how cancels out the English. Lets not forget all the English youths that tried to defend property and helped out in the clearing up after the riots now either.
 
 
Are we talking about *******?

I think that man is trying to make a name for himself as a political/social pundit by jumping in on the trend of youth bashing.

 

Specifically, what's wrong with an average American teen?
 
 
USA: they had to deploy the national guard in 2004 to stop looting after Katrina
France: the gendarmerie were out on the streets of all major French cities in the midst of some of the worst race riots ever in Europe, and there were even fears voiced about the future of the French state, and certainly the government

Every country has a dark side, an underclass, and ours are not the worst, if such skulduggery can be truly qualified.
 
 
are you being serious? british youths are no near the worse

you should see those brazilian kids with hand guns

most of the ones in the UK tend to ride around on bicycles thinking they're hard or what ever. The riots was because police are silly, if they used plastic bullets the would run away. The rioters are like sheep, want to confine them? water gun. want to disperse them? plastic bullet. Want to herde together real life sheep? a Shepherd dog.
 
 
Riot for 4 days, 4 people die and we have the worst youth in the world? Not buying it...
 
 
Behold  , you see the results of years of liberal dogma and child centred thinking. And I agree.
 
 
lol
 
 
 
Specifically, what's wrong with an average American teen?

 

Culturally, and I am stereotyping here as you do when you talk about large groups  , they tend to be more closed-minded, arrogant and lazy.

Of course, not all American teens are like this, but on the whole, I am not a fan of Americans.

Take a look at some of the Presidential candidates for the right... the fact that people like Michelle "Crazy Eyes" Bachman is considered a serious Presidential candidate demonstrates just how intolerable some of them are and how whacked up their culture is. To translate her to British politics, imagine the leader of BNP dictating the Conservative party...

Disclaimer: my opinion, anecdotal, not everyone is like this, etc. etc.  
 
 
Okay, so say around 5,000 "youths" were involved in the riots. That is still a massive minority. To be honest, I'm more concerned about the state of the music industry following Swagger Jagger reaching number 1. Cher Lloyd belongs on Jeremy Kyle, not in the music industry.
 
 
Thank you UK media for continuing to label this as "UK riots". Now everyone in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland gets tarred with the same brush. Wooohoooo!

The difference is that, at no point in their histories, have those countries claimed to be any particular kind of beacon of enlightenment, fairness, goodness etc.
And they are not regarded as being particularly rich overall compared to the UK.
As you say yourself, some of these people who plead 'poverty' have a bit of cash.
They're not poor compared to many people in poor countries who act far better than they do.

It seems to me that the article is entirely fair. A sense of entitlement does pervade British society but it goes right from the top to the bottom. Introducing a National Lottery in 1994 hardly helped matters - now there are charities that have a sense of entitlement that they deserve a handout. It's entirely contrary to a work ethic. If you want to live in a place that respects a work ethic, you have to move to America.
 
 
How many teens have you seen with AK47s?

It's mainly the some ghetto black youths and chavs isn't it?
 
 
Surely there's plenty of worse places in the world. ACTUALLY dangerous places where you could easily find yourself raped and shot for no reason.

But, on the other hand, after living in Spain for half my life, I've never had to watch out for myself or worry about my girlfriend's safety as much as I have in the UK.

But overall, it could be much much worse. UK wins.
 
 
 
Thank you UK media for continuing to label this as "UK riots". Now everyone in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland gets tarred with the same brush. Wooohoooo!

 

Tough, Wales is part of the UK, you get tarred with the same brush. Otherwise become independent.

Cornwall and devon havent had any riots and we are all thoroughly pleasant  

OP, I think its probably to do with population density/social tension because the population density of England is much greater than the other nations in the UK

England:382 people/km2
Scotland: 65
Wales: 142
NI: 125
Cornwall: 144 (I know its not a nation, I'm just including it because it supports my theory)

If you compare them to youths in countries with similar population densities, such as the netherlands, its clear that isnt the only reason. Other reasons may be high youth unemployment which is under 10% in the Netherlands (17-24) but is over 20% for their UK peers (couldnt find data for england alone).

English kids are packed together like sardines compared with other places in the UK which partly explains why they may feel more social tension. Their lack of job prospects and reliance on state support only adds fuel to the fire by giving them less to focus on. If they arent visibly contributing to society they may feel ostracised from it, disconnecting them from their neighbors and making them less likely to appreciate it.
 
 
In the whole world? Tosh. There are a lot of countries in the world with child soldiers who get messed up at the age of 8-12 and then go around shooting and raping civilians through their teenage years until they get killed at some point. Britain doesn't compare to that.
What the Daily Mail means is the "Western"/developed world. Which is a different thing to say entirely.
Even then they are still wrong though. America has a lot more of these kinds of problems than we do.

I think that is unjustiable reasons. Packed like sardines, higher populations- no reason at all. It doesn't explain the riots.

At the end of the day, the riots were a result of the legacy of the Labour administration.
It was an English Problem- something flawed in the "English" culture.

You can't.
It is not a UK problem rather an English problem.

If that was the case, why not refer to them as a European riot. Perhaps the English could be tarred with the same brush as the Greeks, Spanish, Italian and the French... (mind you, they are protesting and not rioting).
 
 
 
It's also correct to refer them to the UK riots as England is part of the United Kingdom.

 

Well in that case, let's call them the European riots.

I find your reason is even more vague and unjustifiable  
Packing lots of poor people into a small space with nothing to do results is likely to amount to social unrest. It doesnt justify the riots but its a contributing factor. You just said its labours fault and theres something flawed in English culture. How vague can you get?

It is not a contributing factor. No one has a gun to those people's head and tell them to riot. Being poor is not a reason, seeing a "foreigner" is not a reason, living in a "packed area" is not a reason as well. It is Labour's fault- let's be honest.
 
 
 
Poland?
Russia?
Serbia?

 

Having spent over a month travelling around Europe this summer, during which time I spent a few days in Poland, met many fellow Russian travellers around the same age as me (I'm 18) and met one Serbian girl I feel I am slightly in a position to comment on your ridiculous post. All of these people are incredibly friendly and courteous. In fact I'd go as far to say that the Polish were amongst the kindest, most welcoming people I met on all my travels. They look like absolute saints beside the so called 'British' scumbags rampaging the streets of London, Manchester etc. The whole time I was in Poland, I didn't see any local youths paralytically drunk at night time and I didn't see any loitering in large antisocial groups wearing Umbro/Adidas tracksuits/trainers. Basically there aren't as many visible uneducated chavs.

Just don't be a ****. Don't make ignorant posts.

These are English riots and an English problem. By the way Cornish people, sorry I should have included Kernow in my previous post! You guys haven't rioted either  
 
 
LOL

America, brazil, Mexigore, Africa, Middle East, Russia.

I doubt we're the worst.
 
 
It's hard to disagree with such statement after the riots.

However, it was the minority who were involved, not the majority thankfully.

America, brazil, Mexigore, Africa, Middle East, Russia.

We're worse than America. I'm not sure about the Middle East, some are very smart, but some weild bazookas at the age of 8.

Mexigore isn't a country.

Russia and Brazil are worse than us.

If you came to my street you could hang out with many of my friends, many of which are every intellectual.. sporty, funny, and very friendly. Does this mean that you have the right to then comment on the whole of the UK ? No.

Long story short. You visiting a country once and seeing a group of people does not mean you can comment on them all.

They're hardly providing a good impression of British youth. Think about it, if you live on the other side of the world and you picked up for most popular newspaper in your country and read about the riots, what you think of British youth?

So if their were riots in France, it could be called the European riots? It's misleading about the scale of them.

Well technically if riots start out in Paris, I wouldn't be surprised if they call them the French riots in the papers.

It'll mostly be the ethnic minorities participating I can guarrantee that.
 
 
 
The whole of Britain will receive the same stick all over the world tbh.

 

That is clearly stupid. It is England's riot. Enough said. It should be referred to as such.
If there was a riot in France- would you expect them to be referred as a European riot thus tarring England with the ills of France?

Please refer to these riots as England's or English riot.
 
 
 
Until our youth is involved in the high murder rates, rape cases and violence where guns and knives are evn more common, i stick by my guns on America being worse than us.

Mexigore is so-called because Mexico is full of GORE, read up on it.

 

But there's more youth in the US so there's bound to be more rape, murder cases. I'd say we're about even.

Mexico is worse than us yeah.

Oh please, don't bring political correctness into this. Referring them as European riots would be a gross hyperbole, but referring them as the British riots is equally acceptable. It's called  totum pro parte.  Do you know what that means?
 
 
This article is from the Daily Mail and so should be taken with a (very large) pinch of salt.
Also I've been to mexico and those few days were enough to make me realise the statement isn't true.

Don't badger me.

It is nothing to do with political correctness. You are an imbecile. It is a fact. A fact! Why ignore this convenient, little, fact that it is an English riot? Get over yourself!
Branding this as a British riot is a gross hyperbole. It is England's riot, please refer to it as such. I never saw the Welsh, Scottish or N.Irish taking part in the riots. The riots took place in England. It is the English riots. Make sure, you are clear on that.
Please do not suggest that England = Britain- that would be ignorant of you. I wouldn't be surprised. You, come across as ignorant.
Funny, how something bad happens in England- such events would be referred to as British or UK. I wonder if the same thing happened in Wales, Scotland, or N.Ireland- would it be referred to as UK or British?

Sad that you'd maybe be inclined to agree after the past few days.... it's a shame. Oh hope none of this has put off people coming for the olympics next year though! It's not all of our youths

 

If it puts people off coming does this mean I'll actually be able to get a ticket now?  
 
 
Just because of the riots? Please come to France, you'll know what a riot is.
 
 
obviously whoever has made this comment has never been to serbia before...
 
 
 
It is not a contributing factor. No one has a gun to those people's head and tell them to riot. Being poor is not a reason, seeing a "foreigner" is not a reason, living in a "packed area" is not a reason as well. It is Labour's fault- let's be honest.

 

I never mentioned immigration in my post though some peoples perception of immigration also causes social unrest. However, you still havent justified your point. What in particular did labour do which made people riot? Using your own analogy they didnt "point a gun to those peoples heads and tell them to riot".

I'm not claiming that the various contributing factors didnt stem from labour policies but the fact they were in power isnt a reason in itself. If that was the reason then the entire countries youths would have rioted. As it stands, it was only a minority of young people.

Since every young person grew up with labour in power, there has to be other reasons why the specific individuals decided to riot. I'm suggesting that a high number of poorer people, without work and feeling cut off from society (living in a very small space) produced a lot of unresolved frustrations in the area. The social stress was finally released when there was an adequate spark to allow it to.

Whether this was the result of labour policies in the past or current conservative policies is irrelevant. It is the policies themselves which contributed to it. The key thing to learn is to avoid the same policies in the future, so this doesnt become a regular occurrence.
 
 
I don't agree with that at all. Despite the riots being on a big-ish scale, it's still a small minority who caused the trouble and other countries should take a look at their own selves once in a while!

But not area of England rioted.... Why should all of England be blamed for something that only happened in a few areas, mostly cities?

No, Looks at Mexican youth, Then come back and tell me British are the worst.

 

I lived in Chihuahua for about a year and have travelled all over Mexico. I didn't find Mexican youths particularly problematic.
 
 
To be honest, sadly I agree. Not most violent but unpleasant yeah. I'm not just referring to the riots either.

I've lived in the USA and Spain and I've travelled to France, Philippines and Hawaii(I know still USA but its different). Been living in England for 9 years now.

When I first came to this country in 2002 I was really intimidated and scared at some of the teenagers here in England. I was a little year 7 student in a catholic school and the ammount of scumbags was just shocking. Lots of scary older students who use to mess around with the younger ones, lots of racism(never towards black people, but penty against Indian/Pakistani and East Asian people), I had a lot of adjusting to do and I really had to tougen up and grow thick skin because I got a lot of racial abuse with people making racist remarks towards me on a regular basis.

The booze and sex culture in this country is also really disgusting(sorry), loads of young people start drinking and having sex at such a young age, there seems to be an attitude of "it's okay and perfectly normal to have one night stands as long as your over 16 and use protection!", some screwed up morals if I'm being honest...

Lots of really nice teenagers too of course! But also plenty of disgusting chavs that cause trouble and have no respect.

Don't get me wrong, I love this country and I'm really grateful to be here, I'm just saying what I feel, Britains youth really can be very unpleasant and are worse than what I've felt in other countries.

But the thing is if this happened in any other country it would have been CRUSHED. Or at least dealt with far more severely than in the UK at the start of the looting/arson. I'm willing to bet if this happened in say the US where all the police was allowed to was stand there and try to obstruct the rioters the same thing would have happened.
 
 
 
Good. I don't blame people thinking that British youth are scum. In many circumstances, it is true.

 

I agree. I've been to many EU countries and they have much more pleasant and accepting cultures that dont glorify violence.

Spain is the only one that is going down that road in reality and thats due to the mass influx of Brits, you only have to look at what a dive Benidorm has become to see that.

I've also been to America and the culture is different. People think its all bad because of the media but in reality its a lot more cultural than here and the youth have more respect. Those that dont are usually kept to specific areas.

I FULLY AGREE WITH DAVID STARKEY. ARGHHHHH! you all make me so angry! are you blind? so many of you are walking around in denial!! as for the young lad and the woman on that video, they are so in denial it makes me sick.
 http://gatesofvienna.blogspot.com/20...w-rioters.html  look at this video, oh we need to be overly politically correct - we can't be racist! but if a black person says something like this about a group of white people? nah, it doesn't matter!
"In this country in 15 or 20 years' time the black man will have the whip hand over the white man." - Powell. After the past few days that seems scarily accurate. I'm worried for the future of our country - Problems are seldom solved by pretending things are as you want them to be.

I'll get hundreds of negs for this post but I don't care! At least I'm speaking the truth, like David Starkey has done, we need to change this country before it gets worse. I'm not returning to this account, for the record I am 19 years old, and I wanted to state a controversial view amongst a predominantly anti-racist fair-minded equal opportunities PC generation of students because I doubt anyone else is going to say it!

What do you want to call them then? The London, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Nottingham, etc. riots? Oh wait, but they weren't in all areas of these cities either!

Exactly my point, why are people tarring a whole nation with this brush when it wasn't a whole nation that committed the actions?

The fact of the matter is that, these cities happened to be in England hence England or English riots.

The first stage of changing your ways is to accept the truth and stop living in denial.
 
 
 
Whether this was the result of labour policies in the past or current It is the policies themselves which contributed to it.

 

It is relevant. The fact of the matter is Labour made the situation worse.

After inheriting a sound economy-

1) It expanded the public sector (of course the public sector needs investment but it shouldn't be as large)
2) Didn't invest enough in the private sector
3) Education - went downhill. Lack of Literacy and Numeracy skill on the increase.
4) Despite the "good times", poverty increased
5) The gap between the rich and poor expanded enormously. People can't get on the ladder to success or not as easily

There are many more.

At the least the present government have gone some way to correcting the problem but I have said before that even the current government is the same as the old one - I say this because, we are still borrowing money, increasing tax, bills on the rise, inflation on the rise, pointless expansion of wars etc...

I think that personally, Labour brought a culture of Jeremy kyle (or Trisha Goddards in the earlier years).

However, it's not an English riot, is it? Not everyone participating were English people.

That does NOT mean they were Welsh or Scottish or Northern Irish.

What about the British-born ethnic minorities who participated in the riots? Ergo, they were British citizens, so it can realistically be called a British riot.

Portraying it as an English riot would be unfair to English people.

How are they British then if they aren't English, NORTHERN Irish, Scottish or Welsh?   Some people could have come from India, the Caribbean, Pakistan or wherever but they aren't in Britain.

The fact is that they happened in England, therefore they are the England/English riots.
 
 
Oh come on. Gangs in America make ours look positively tame.

Born in Britain -> British passport -> British citizen -> British (colloquially speaking)
 
 
I hate how because of the riots all the youths in britain get stereotyped. I would say most youths in britain arent like that.
 
 
I find that hard to believe.

The people participating in the riots were, as far as I am aware, English people.

You admit that stating that "does not they were Welsh, Scottish or N.Irish".

You admit the participants of the riot were English people?

Yes, there were ethnic minorities participating in the riot, and your point is what exactly?

Are you suggesting that a black or brown person can not be English?

As long as a person was born in England, they are English. Even then, a person residing in England holding a British passport is British as well as English (for the sheer reason, they are staying in England).

Yes, English people did participate in the riots.

Get your head screwed on. Just admit, the English are an uncivilized bunch in comparison to the Welsh, Scottish and N.Irish

Anyway, the riots occurred in England therefore it is an English or England's riots. Even you admitted that.

Pretty sure they've not got a patch on what comes out of Congo - 12 year olds with AK47s.

You are wrong.
The riots were in England. Therefore, refer to it as the English riots.
Why tar the Scottish, Welsh, N.Irish with the ills of the English?
Using your logic, the riots in Greece are European. Therefore, England should be tarred with the Greek riots.
Stop being idiotic about this. Refer to it as English riots.

Nice to see you ignore most of my response. I suppose, it shut you up hence your petty reply.

Not all of the people would have been British anyway. If there was a riot in Japan but had people from many different Asian countries you wouldn't call them the Asian riots would you? You name a riot based on its most specific place, not the people involved. Just admit that you're wrong already without making up all this *******s.
 
 
 
Exactly. Spot on. The riots were in England so it was an English riot.

Yes, yes she is. It seems that she would rather sound like an idiot than admit that she's wrong for once in her life.

Exactly. Is ISA so egotistical that she can't admit she is wrong. It is evident that the riots took place in England hence should be aptly named England's riots or English riots.
 
 
Finally we're getting the recognition we deserve  

Anyway, I'm sure America's youth is much, much worse.
