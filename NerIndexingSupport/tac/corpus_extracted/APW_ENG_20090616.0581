The Bangladesh Cricket Board has lifted the 10-year bans imposed on 14 cricketers who played in the rebel Indian Cricket League.

The move allows the players, including former national team captain Habibul Bashar, to play in domestic leagues, the BCB said in a media statement on Tuesday.

The players have all quit the ICL but may not return to the national team immediately as they need to spend a year of "cooling off" period, the statement said.

Last month, the BCB announced an amnesty for those who would quit the ICL by June 15.

The players reported that they terminated their contracts with ICL by the deadline.

"As they have fulfill the requirements to avail the amnesty the BCB, therefore, has decided that these players are eligible to play in all forms of domestic cricket," the BCB statement said.

Last year, the cricketers joined a team called Dhaka Warriors and competed in the ICL -- a Twenty20 league which was not sanctioned by the International Cricket Council.

BCB responded with a 10-year ban disallowing them to represent Bangladesh in ay form of cricket.

Dhaka Warriors was the second ICL team outside India after the Lahore Badshahs.

The loss of so many top players was a big blow to the Bangladesh national team which was already struggling to be competitive against the top international sides.
