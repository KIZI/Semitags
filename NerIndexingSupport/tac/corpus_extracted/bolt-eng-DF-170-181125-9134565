Why jihadist's and their apologizers are a grave threat to the world:

Beyond Munich  The Spirit of Eurabia
By Bat Yeor
FrontPageMagazine.com | July 2, 2004

The following presentation by Bat Ye'or was delivered at a seminar in the French Senate in Paris three weeks ago - The Editors.

*

Allow me first to make a preliminary observation about the title of this session: the return of the spirit of Munich  a title which I find somewhat optimistic. At Munich, in 1938, France and England, exhausted by the death toll of the Great War, abandoned Czechoslovakia to the Nazi beast, in the hope that by doing so they would avoid another conflict. The spirit of Munich thus refers to a policy of states and of peoples who refuse to confront a threat, and attempt to obtain peace and security through conciliation and appeasement, or even, for some, an active collaboration with the criminals.

For my own part, I would say that we have gone beyond the spirit of Munich, and the present situation should be seen not in the context of the Second World War, but in the present jihadist context.

In fact, for the past 30 years France and Europe are living in a situation of passive self-defense against terrorism. This began with Palestinian terrorism, then Islamic terrorism, not to speak of the local European terrorism, including the Basques in Spain, the Baader-Meinhof group in Germany, and the Red Brigades of Italy of the 1980s.

One need only look at our cities, airports, and streets, at the schools with their security guards, even the systems of public transportation, not to mention the embassies, and the synagogues  to see the whole astonishing array of police and security services. The fact that the authorities everywhere refuse to name the evil does not negate that evil. Yet we know perfectly well that we have been under threat for a long time; one has only to open ones eyes and our authorities know it better than any of us, because it is they who have ordered these very security measures.

They are repeating history, the author is correct:

Again, this is correct and something most Americans are unaware of or have forgotten:

Europe needs to wake up and smell the :cof: Great post! :clap1:
 
 
i think it is sad that many in europe are forgetting the lesson in fire the innocent civilians of Madrid recieved on 3/11. europe has gotten so used to annual terrorist attacks of small magnitude that it has lulled them into a false sense of security. they've gotten used to terrorism. i can't blame them for that, but after what happened on 3/11, i can't excuse them for not waking up and smelling the burning bodies that were strewn across train tracks and stations in madrid. their police forces are doing very well fighting terrorism, but their militaries (which aren't as bad as some would make it out, they can't compete with the US but that doesn't make them worthless) aren't doing nearly enough. and there will be more 9/11's and more 3/11's with that kind of attitude and negligence.

They DO NOT feel 'secure', they are hoping they will be the last eaten...
 
 
i think that's a sad viewpoint.. there are many bad apples over there, but not that many.

they have been experiencing terrorism on a regular scale for decades... that is a reasonable reason to get lulled into a false sense of normalcy. the europeans fight off the domestic terror groups, then the PLO starts bombing. they stop the PLO, then the islamists start. who next? that's what they seem to think.

the US on the other hand only really experienced 9/11, a cataclysmic event for America that shocked the world. america is not used to terrorism, it does not happen on an ordinary basis. europe is. 3/11 should have been their 9/11, and i think for their police and intelligence services, it was. their militaries and overall populaces however, are still lulled into a sense of normalcy.

it takes time.

Problem is, they don't HAVE TIME!
 
 
we all do. we just don't know how much. i could say we've been out of time, but that would have to do with 15 years of incompetence from our national leadership on not securing russia's nuclear, chemical and biological arsenals.

they'll come around, who knows when? i'm not going to turn them away when they finally do wake up. we need all the help we can get. think its bad now? just wait till saudi arabia falls apart and pakistan's gov't gets overthrown.

that's why we need to put the afterburner in our speed to secure better relations with india and to help the iranian people themselves overthrew their rulers, along with helping Turkey into the EU.

UMmm, the US couldn't have secured Russia's weapons, they are soverign state, communist or not. That was silly.

It's not US turning from Europe, at least not at first, though waving away the NATO offer was a bit of a slap. It's not Europe that is against the US, but rather France, Germany, and European intellectuals and writers. The governments in most of Europe are behind the US, though the people are not, which is why Schroeder ran as anti-American. It's confusing, but bridges are falling and others being built. Nothing stays static, I believe we are living through a paradigm making era, which we won't know, until they are formed.
 
 
you're right about europe

about russia and its WMD, they've been asking for our help for 15 years with this. they don't have enough money, which is why Sen. Nunn (ret.) and Sen. Lugar, among many other senators, have worked so hard to help the Russians secure those weapons.

russia doesn't want to get rid of all its WMD, just a lot of it that they can't use or don't want, and that which they cannot guard anymore.

Ok on the Russian thing, we did drop the ball on helping them out. I thought so at the time, especially with investment money. You know Stalin turned down Marshall Plan aid, I figured we should have renewed the offer when it all came tumbling down. Problem was, there was history of US investment in Russia for 2 centuries, every time investments made, the state took it and the people had to run for their lives, some not making it. So there you go. Ecologically and militarily they have a big problem. Seems to me that we should help out, but wouldn't you think that EU should also be addressing?
 
 
yea the EU should work the economic/environmental part, we should work the WMD part.

one day hopefully Russia will be part of a renewed, improved NATO and EU.

One day soon Russia can take our place in NATO, turning it into a European defense, bought and paid for by EU, and their rightful place in EU.
 
 
well i wouldn't say all that but

who knows?

i would like to see a world defense organization filled with our NATO allies (save France probably), Japan, India, Nigeria, Brazil, Jordan, Israel, Iraq, Russia, Singapore, Australia and a few other nations.

doubt it would happen, but India, Singapore and Brazil will all be important allies in the future that we are not cultivating enough right now.

It's back to the paradigm again, we can't see who is going to end up on the bridges and which bridges will come down. It's a very unsettled time.
 
 
how long till the dust settles?

2-3 years? 5? 10? 20?

I'd say that we'll have to watch what happens with the elections and the WOT. If we stop, the whole shebang goes on hold while the networks rebuild and they will rebuild. Then we'll pick it up once again.

If we press on, it's hard to tell, but staff report #15 of the 911 Commission says that al queda is no longer able to mount an attack on the US, at his time. So, will it turn into a religious war, which I fear? Will it be beaten back to their own hinterlands? Time will tell...
 
 
yep

and what happens with saudi arabia and pakistan?

will iran be free before the decade ends?

etc
etc

I think SA is going to fall, I think perhaps along the lines of the French Revolution, with swords instead of guillotine.

Pakistan is a ? Right now my thinking is the government IS really reforming, but their people don't want it, that's NOT going to work.

Iran, the mullahs are heavily armed and ruthless, they control the military, see British sailors held. No, I don't think the young are going to be able to overthrow, but would not be surprised to see young bailing as refugees.* This could change rapidly if US or Israel moves here.*
 
 
i see the revolution happening with both pakistan and saudi

i do hold out hope for iran though, their rulers are so discredited among their own people, and as the baby boom there continues until about 2015, that means only more and more young people sick and tired of theocracy and watching satellite images of America and Europe's democracy

I thought the same about Iran during the summer 2001, when that was extinquished, I changed my mind. Hope I'm wrong. As I said though, if US or Israel moves on in here, things could change rapidly and I think there is a good chance of that, if the WOT continues....
 
 
what is your view of India?

Huge power, huge population. Between India and China they could rule the world, easily.

India though has not been an aggressor, even with Pakistan has been more of a reactor. They have a waste in the caste system, but micro slowly they seem to be addressing that. At the present rate expect improvement on that front in 500 years or so.

They have a very bright core population, that continues to leave for greener pastures, especially the US. Huge brain drain, but good for us.
 
 
yea, the brain drain is in effect

hmm what will become of all that?

if we can help the pakistanis and the indians reach agreement on kashmir, that would remove a fairly large grievance in the muslim community, as well as a source of terrorism, and lessen the chances of nuclear war between the two

i see them as a natural ally, (a) they don't trust china (b) they're a democracy (c) terrorism is their greatest fear (d) they would like to be alligned with us anyway, consider the joint US-Indian space and technology development agreements
 
 
do you know anything about belarus or have an opinion on them?

Not a whole lot. Know they were close to Russia, but I think they had a falling out. It's one of the more successful of the one-time satellites I'm pretty sure. I'm more familiar with the Ukraine, which I would guess Belarus has some of the same problems. Corruption at the local level makes it very difficult for people to succeed, it's like mafia control. The people desperately want to work, so they leave if they can.

Like much of the former USSR, very low or negative birthrates, so a quickly growing older population, add to that the exodus of the young and educated whenever possible, you've got a big problem.
 
 
oh

they're the last remaining dictatorship in europe

their leader hobnobs with saddam (used to) milosevic (used to) the mullahs in iran, syria's dictator, north korea, etc etc

didn't hear much from the NATO summit about what to do about them

Well that's probably because they're not much of a threat to anyone? Again, we can't right every wrong, if we want to try I think there are plenty of problems in the Americas South of here.

Dictatorships are sometimes the only thing that avoids total chaos. I'm thinking of Tito, granted brutal but effective at keeping Yugoslavia from devolving into what happened later. Not good, just an aside.
 
 
this joker is just a thug but i understand your point

at least he's not OUR sob...

i can't stand that mentality...

on an aside note, i highly recommend a book to check out if you get a chance, its on this topic and is by reagan's ambassador to hungary (the guy actually marched with the freedom marchers against the communist regime, pretty ballsy for an ambassador and my personal idea of what an ambassador should be doing if its possible), its been universally praised by folks all over the political spectrum and for good reason

how to rid the world of the real axis of evil:how to topple the world's 45 remaining dictatorships by 2025
by ambassador mark palmer

great reading if you want different ideas on how to handle dicatators and oppressive gov'ts
