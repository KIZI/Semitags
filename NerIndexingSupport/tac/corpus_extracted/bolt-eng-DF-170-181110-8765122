God, he is clueless. So desperate for something, anything to take the spotlight off of himself.

The only thing historic is the level of his failure.
 
 
Katrina was historical. Irene? We'll see. Joe Bastardi says it could be one of the worst of the century. He's usually right too.

Don't you usually wait until after a disaster to make judgements about it?

I'm sure Obama wants it to be bad so he can be seen as the rescuer.

OK, what is NOT historic about Hurricane Irene. Please explain.

If someone is cruel, stupid and partisan, they might just jump top such a conclusion. But, it takes those peculiar qualities to assume such a thing in the first place, doesn't it?
 
 
Perhaps we should wait until after the hurricane ends before pronouncing it historic.

But then maybe he is right. After all, isn't everything we do and everything that happens historic after it happens?
 
 
If it were an historic hurricane, a wise person would probably cut short his vacation and get back to the business of doing his job. However, the current person in the White House doesn't have a real good track record of showing up at disaster areas until several days after the fact.

It may be a really bad hurricane, but I don't know if I could qualify it as "historic." Let's hope for the best, but prepare for the worst.

Historic means it's in the past.
 
 
Everytime I think that certain Rightie posters can't get any lower and be any sillier in what they whine about, along comes someone like the OP to prove me wrong.
 
 
He is fucking out of his mind. You can tax the productive class away, but not a hurricane. How is Obama going to tax Irene away?
 
 
So far there is NOTHING historic about it. It's a catagory 2 and losing strength.

This storm is going right up the East Coast Metropolitan population corridor. Of course it is nothing. Of course you know it will be nothing. Cancel those evacuations, okay?

They evacuated for a 5.8 earthquake, they couldn't shovel a few feet of snow cause they went on strike. hhhhmmm! We better hope Irene is gentle.

Well, I was listening to a repeat of Obama's speech and what he said is that Irene has the Potential to be a historic hurricane.

But I'm enjoying this OPs whine-fest nonetheless.
 
 
Obama needs a disaster so he can act like he's in charge of something.

He's still drinking beer at Martha's Vinyard when he should be organizing and bracing for Irene....his usual M.O.

Hurricanes NEVER come close to NYC. There hasn't been one in that area for over 50 years. It's not something to be partisan over because it could be very bad for a lot of people.

Obama is into hyperbole in case you hadn't noticed.

He hopes it's serious....but not too serious so that it can't be handled in a day or two unlike Katrina was.

I'm hoping everyone just gets rained on and that's it.

All indications point to Hurricane Irene being a "historic" storm, President Obama said. The federal government is coordinating with state and local agencies to be fully prepared to handle the storm, he said.

President Obama said just now that people in the projected path of Hurricane Irene should take precautions immediately.

"Don't wait; don't delay," he said.
 
 
I nominate this thread as Thread of the Week!      

Righties complain about Obama wanting nation prepared for Hurricane Irene!

Oh yeah...so the president telling people that this could be an historic hurricane is somehow wrong. Guess what...it could be because hurricanes NEVER come close to NYC or the Northeast where there is dense population. This could be devastating for a lot of people and you're harping on this? Shame on you.

Um then you would put weathermen out of a job, because this is what they do. Make judgements on things.
 
 
I'm mocking the fear mongering. People act like we've never delt with a hurricane before. As far as New York is concerned the hurricane is predicted to be a category 1 or less by the time it gets there. Lots of rain and high winds. Hopefully no one is injured but Obama inserting himself into the limelight is completely unnecessary.
He can't give us a jobs plan but he can forecast the weather. Give me a break.

Nah it wont be that bad. Back in 95 we had bob hit boston and that was a cat1 at that point. I mean you had damage and such but the northeast gets these all the time. They are called noreaster's.

That being said there is nothing wrong with telling people to becareful and not be stupid.

And to the op. Quit your whining ass bitching over nothing.

You're being a fuckig partisan hack, because if something did happen you would be on here making numerous threads about how.obama failed to act.
Your game is transparent so stop trying to act like your shit dont stink.
 
 
Obama needs to do something. He should at least go rolling skating while listening to Def Leppard.

That would be cool and we could stick to Yeltsin. Boris hates Def Leppard.
 
 
Obama should just keep his mouth shut. Everytime he makes a prediction or speaks publicly shit gets worse.
 
 
Oh dear! The Governor of New Jersey is holding a press conference telling people to be prepared and that the hurricane could be worse than they predicted yesterday.

I anticipate the thread complaining about him.

Perhaps we should wait until after the hurricane ends before pronouncing it historic.

But then maybe he is right. After all, isn't everything we do and everything that happens historic after it happens?

 

That depends. If Obama gave us word from experts that a meteor was set to devastate North America, he could announce it in advance as a historic event. The experts are saying this is going to be worse than any before, so his announcement to me seems logically driven.

What I find odd is, Bush made so many future predictions about everything, and none of those things happened. Maybe that is what Gramps places his ignorance on, Obama isn't Bush & the thinking capsule isn't loaded with whiskey.
 
 
 
God, he is clueless. So desperate for something, anything to take the spotlight off of himself.

While I do think Obama is hoping for another excuse to blame for our Problems.

Irene does actually have the potential to be Historic. Not because it is extra powerful or anything. It has to do with the Projected Track. It looks as if the eye of the storm could pass just to the west of NYC. Most hurricanes that scrap the east coast do so with the eye well off shore, east of all the population. With the eye west of Populations if could be more destructive in terms of wind and storm surge than anything NYC has seen in over 160 Years.
 
 
 
So far there is NOTHING historic about it. It's a catagory 2 and losing strength.

 

Oh good. So why should he stop vacationing, again?

Tell me about it. I worked nine out of the past ten days, and just got notified there is 72 hours of overtime available during my three day weekend, because so many of my coworkers are on the east coast.

As Hurricane Irene barrels toward the East Coast, President Obama interrupted his Martha's Vineyard vacation to urge residents in the path of the storm to make emergency preparations and heed evacuation orders from authorities.

"I cannot stress this highly enough," Obama said in statement to television cameras from his vacation compound of Blue Heron Farm in Chilmark, "if you are in the projected path of this hurricane, you have to take precautions now. Dont wait. Dont delay. We all hope for the best, but we have to be prepared for the worst."

The president, who is scheduled to leave Martha's Vineyard on Saturday morning to return to Washington, D.C., after his 10-day vacation, said Americans need "to take this storm seriously."

"You need to listen to your state and local officials, and if you are given an evacuation order, please follow it," Obama said, adding that the federal government was taking its own precautions by ordering an aircraft group out to sea Thursday to avoid the storm.

Being a native Floridian I often mused what it would be like if the "pompous New Yorkers" were to get hit by a hurricane.

Now that it's closer to being a reality I'm not finding any satisfaction from it.

We're talking MILLIONS of people, in just that 1 city, without power.
Flooded subways.
Children and elderly.

Prayers going up.

I'm sure Obama wants it to be bad so he can be seen as the rescuer.

 

If someone is cruel, stupid and partisan, they might just jump top such a conclusion. But, it takes those peculiar qualities to assume such a thing in the first place, doesn't it?

 

kinda like you partisan assholes when you post that Republicans want the economy to tank. you rat assed hypocrite.

And the flabbergasting of the Conservatives continues. The president issues a statement saying all indications are Hurricane Irene could be an historic hurricane and the right goes ape!

The president says it's important to heed the warnings of state and local officials about evacuations and again, the Conservatives go ape.

Are those flabbergasted Conservatives wondering aloud why this president can't just act as his predecessor did and ignore the potential risks?

Seems that the Conservatives are harping on the saw "never waste a crisis" while they themselves are doing their level best to politicize a crisis! And they don't see irony any more than they're able to accept culpability for the failures of their own misguided and counterproductive ideas and policies.

Read this thread well, fellow citizens! Decide for yourselves whether actions and accountability count more for one ideology than the other. Remember well, fellow citizen, how New Orleans was destroyed while the Right fumbled and punted and patted themselves on the back for "doin' a heck of a job!".

And for all you 'shrink the government' types, consider where the pertinent information, evacuation procedures and aid centers are coming from during this and other crises. From you much vaunted 'free markets' or from competent, concerned and pro=active state, local and federal government officials.
 
 
The people in New Orleans were warned and chose to ignore the warnings. Thats a conviction of personal choice not govt mistakes.

You seem to enjoy lumping 'all Conservatives' into a single mold, just as much as 'some conservatives' enjoy lumping 'all liberals' into a single mold. Both are wrong.

I offer my statements in this thread as proof that not all conservatives are politicizing this issue, nor are we all 'going ape'.

Of course, you'll promptly ignore my post and continue to harp on about how we're all alike.
 
 
 
 
 
Obama should just keep his mouth shut. Everytime he makes a prediction or speaks publicly shit gets worse.

 

Do shut up.

 

Get off my nuts. I'll post as I see fit about our Failure n Chief

God, he is clueless. So desperate for something, anything to take the spotlight off of himself.

The only thing historic is the level of his failure.

 

I'm lookin' at it, this way.......

If Irene WHACKS the Carolinas (specifically, South Carolina) & Virginia, it could (potentially) "take-out" a significant number o' White - trash Teabaggers, due to their resistance of government-help..... but, they'll be easy (enough) to identify....after devolving to their natural (collective) state o' intellectual-limitations....

Answer my question numbnuts.

PS. Everyone and their brother is on TV with wall to wall coverage and you think Obama expressing his opinion matters? No one was going to heed the warnings until Obama makes a statement saying exactly the same things? Somehow he is a saint for mimicking the weather man.

This storm is going right up the East Coast Metropolitan population corridor. Of course it is nothing. Of course you know it will be nothing. Cancel those evacuations, okay?

I'll take that as a yes.

This is what he actually said.

 
All indications point to this being a historic hurricane, he added.

I cannot stress this highly enough: If you are in the projected path of this hurricane, you have to take precautions now. Dont wait. Dont delay. We all hope for the best, but we have to be prepared for the worst. All of us have to take this storm seriously. You need to listen to your state and local officials, and if you are given an evacuation order, please follow it, Mr. Obama said.

 

Any governor would and should say the same. Often hurricanes don't live up to expectations, but it is always better to be safe than sorry.

If it were an historic hurricane, a wise person would probably cut short his vacation and get back to the business of doing his job. However, the current person in the White House doesn't have a real good track record of showing up at disaster areas until several days after the fact.

It may be a really bad hurricane, but I don't know if I could qualify it as "historic." Let's hope for the best, but prepare for the worst.

OK, what is NOT historic about Hurricane Irene. Please explain.

 

Everything. What IS historic about it? Here is NOAA's historical list of hurricanes and as you can see the area has been hit many times before and by more powerful storms. The only thing historic so far is the amount of misinformation being generated by the collective media.

Don't you usually wait until after a disaster to make judgements about it?

 

Depends on the disaster moron. If its a hurricane we can some predictions about what its going to do before it does it. Its called science.

 

There's his problem right there.

Some big time forecasting CEO just twittted that the storm is totally hyped by the media and will be a nothing by the time it gets to NYC. Pressure is rising and no more eyewall. Over on DRUDGE right ow.........too tired to post the link......

Alarmists are gay............they are everywhere in the science community too. Cant blame 'em though........hysterical sells.
 
 
NBC will probably pump some water into 30 Rock just for effect.

I'm sure Obama wants it to be bad so he can be seen as the rescuer.

 

and you think you need to insult anything he ever says which makes you shallow and pedantic

The media should just ignore every storm until after the damage has occurred. That's the rightie way afterall - 20/20 hindsight, and fuck foresight because if you can't be 100% accurate there's no point.

Obama announced in advance that this could be a historic hurricane.

Obama announced in advance that the unemployment rate wouldn't go above 8% if his stimulus plan was enacted.

I'm just sayin.........

 

Now that is logical thinking, at last, as far as predictions go. Question is, what advantage does Obama get for warning Americans? Who put him up to making this announcement for the benefit of the American people.

 

That would be the Gov of NC.

 NC governor declares state of emergency for Irene | The Asheville Citizen-Times | citizen-times.com 

She declared a SOE on Wednesday.

RALEIGH  North Carolina Gov. Beverly Perdue has declared a state of emergency for the region east of Interstate 95 in preparation of approaching Hurricane Irene.

Perdue also said Thursday she has asked President Barack Obama to declare a federal emergency ahead of the storm reaching North Carolina this weekend to help accelerate response efforts.

Kudos to Perdue!!

How Presidential is a buffoon that announces BEFORE the hurricane ever makes any landfall, that it is Historic? All he is doing is promoting hysteria and fear. Hurricanes historically weaken at certain points. And they do not always regain strength later. It was only a Cat 3 and is now a Cat 2. Probably a Cat 1 after it passes the Outer Banks. The only thing historic about it is our President is fear mongering by using it, probably in hopes of being seen as a savior afterwards.

Instead he is likely to be seen the fool.

Wow. 3 days before landfall.
The Governor of Louisiana also declared a SOE 3 days before Katrina.

Hope for NC's sake the President is a bit more responsive with 3 days notice this time around.

The Federal Government ask Nagin to evacuate New Orleans. He and the Governor refused. In fact the day before the Hurricane Nagin was still refusing to evacuate. What did the Governor do? She placed the bulk of the National Guard in the city she was in. She ignored New Orleans completely.

The Federal Government was in New Orleans within 3 days of the hurricane, even though all bridges were out, all roads flooded and all airports unusable. And what happened? Nagin refused to inform FEMA of where all his evacuation sites were, refused to assign police to the large ones to control the crime.

Then what did Nagin do? Illegally seized all private citizens weapons so they could not protect themselves or their property.
 
 
 
The Federal Government ask Nagin to evacuate New Orleans. He and the Governor refused. In fact the day before the Hurricane Nagin was still refusing to evacuate.

When's the last time a hurricane hit NC?

 

 
 
OK, what is NOT historic about Hurricane Irene. Please explain.

 

Everything. What IS historic about it? Here is NOAA's historical list of hurricanes and as you can see the area has been hit many times before and by more powerful storms. The only thing historic so far is the amount of misinformation being generated by the collective media.

It don't?

Maybe they'll get off lightly. Here's hoping. The last thing this country needs is for one coast to be annihilated. It's already downgraded to a one.

I'm landlocked, never been in a hurricane. But I know they can switch back up after they've been switched down. I have read it in books.

The hype over Hurricane Irene is overblown, predicts the CEO of Advanced Forecasting Corporation.

"North of Delaware, most hurricane force winds will very likely be gusts, not sustained winds."

o The demise of Irene has already begun. There is no visible eye. The storm intensity is down to 99 mph. This would be a low-end category 2 or a strong category 1 storm, while 36 hours ago some predicted a catastrophic category 4 storm. Air Force Reserve aircraft have found that Irene's eyewall has collapsed, and the central pressure has risen -- rising pressure means a weakening storm.

o The reduction in storm intensity likely confirms that this storm is not going to be as monstrous as it has been publicly forecast to be.

o Yes, it will be windy. However, north of Delaware most hurricane force winds will very likely be gusts, not sustained winds.

Not if you're trying to convince people to take precautions.Some of the things you guys come up with to needle Obama about are just pathetic.

The Federal Government ask Nagin to evacuate New Orleans. He and the Governor refused. In fact the day before the Hurricane Nagin was still refusing to evacuate.

 

That's not even true. Mayor Nagin ordered a mandatory evacuation a 9 am the morning after the federal government declared a state of emergency. You're so ignorant of basic facts - and appear to be willing to just make shit up when you don't know - is it worth even debating you over it?

 

The federal government can not issue a state of emergency for a state, it is the governor that does that. Bush called the governor several times asking her to issue a state of emergency so he could engage fema. She didn't until it was too late. It was ridiculous watching that, the mayor of New Orleans would tell people to evacuate, the governor would say no don't do that, then the governor would say evacuate and the mayor would say no don't so that. What a nut job of local governments. And 1,000 empty buses sat and did not even get started up to rescue anyone. Yet, still to this day Bush is blamed for that. A President can not issue a state of emergency for any state, that is the law, it has to come from the governor of that state.

That would be the Gov of NC.

 NC governor declares state of emergency for Irene | The Asheville Citizen-Times | citizen-times.com 

She declared a SOE on Wednesday.

RALEIGH — North Carolina Gov. Beverly Perdue has declared a state of emergency for the region east of Interstate 95 in preparation of approaching Hurricane Irene.

Perdue also said Thursday she has asked President Barack Obama to declare a federal emergency ahead of the storm reaching North Carolina this weekend to help accelerate response efforts.

Kudos to Perdue!!

 

Wow. 3 days before landfall.
The Governor of Louisiana also declared a SOE 3 days before Katrina.

Hope for NC's sake the President is a bit more responsive with 3 days notice this time around.

 

The Federal Government ask Nagin to evacuate New Orleans. He and the Governor refused. In fact the day before the Hurricane Nagin was still refusing to evacuate. What did the Governor do? She placed the bulk of the National Guard in the city she was in. She ignored New Orleans completely.

The Federal Government was in New Orleans within 3 days of the hurricane, even though all bridges were out, all roads flooded and all airports unusable. And what happened? Nagin refused to inform FEMA of where all his evacuation sites were, refused to assign police to the large ones to control the crime.

Then what did Nagin do? Illegally seized all private citizens weapons so they could not protect themselves or their property.

 

That is very true, I watched it all, what a circus from the local government.

 Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 

New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin was also criticized for failing to implement his evacuation plan and for ordering residents to a shelter of last resort without any provisions for food, water, security, or sanitary conditions. Perhaps the most important criticism of Nagin is that he delayed his emergency evacuation order until less than a day before landfall, which led to hundreds of deaths of people who (by that time) could not find any way out of the city.[2] Adding to the criticism was the broadcast of school bus parking lots full of yellow school buses which Mayor Nagin refused to be used in evacuation. When asked why the buses were not used to assist evacuations instead of holing up in the Superdome, a lack of insurance liability and bus drivers were given as reasons

Katrina was originally headed to the Florida panhandle. It turned and headed to New Orleans on FRIDAY August 26th. Governor Blanco declared a state of emergency on FRIDAY August 26th. Here's the link you ignorant fucktard

 Office of the Governor, Kathleen Babineaux Blanco, State of Louisiana - Press Releases 

On the other hand, Governor Halley Barbour of the Personal Responsibility Party waited until Saturday to declare a state of emergency for Mississippi

On Saturday, Blanco requested a federal declaration of emergency, which was granted the same day.

Now shut the fuck up about shit you obviously know NOTHING ABOUT.

 
It was ridiculous watching that, the mayor of New Orleans would tell people to evacuate, the governor would say no don't do that, then the governor would say evacuate and the mayor would say no don't so that.

Most of the so called "facts" aren't even true. You people are so fucking stupid you can't even grasp basic objective fact.

Here's a brief time line to fill in your obvious ignorance:

Wednesday: Katrina predicted to hit Florida panhandle

Thursday: Katrina still predicted to hit Florida panhandle.

Friday: about 5 pm - Katrina veers towards Louisiana.
about 11pm - Katrina firmly predicted to hit New Orleans, Blanco declares state of emergency

Saturday:
about 5pm - Mayor Nagin declares a state of emergency and voluntary evacuation

Sunday:
about 11 am - Nagin orders mandatory evacuation
about noon - contraflow traffic initiated
~ - Bush declares state of emergency
Monday:
about 9 am - the first levees breach
 
 
 
New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin was also criticized for failing to implement his evacuation plan...

 

"his" evacuation plan? Mayor Nagin did not write an evacuation plan.

You are an idiot. The Hurricane HIT on SUNDAY. You are aware that Sunday is one day from Saturday?

Nagin did not order an evacuation until Saturday night. Th storm hit on Sunday. Nagin did not follow his own Emergency procedures. Nagin did not use city buses or school Buses. Nagin used emergency secondary facilities as evac points. No food, no water, no toilets, no security.

Bad thing that you never bothered to read it.

At all levels of government, the Katrina response was a failure. However, the fact that Bush had appointed a failed horse show manager as the head of FEMA and that Brown simply failed to act at all, was the failure that people will remember. We have long expected failure and ignorance from Southern governors and mayors. We do not expect it at the Federal level. Unless we elect another Texas governor to the Presidency.

How Presidential is a buffoon that announces BEFORE the hurricane ever makes any landfall, that it is Historic?

 

Well, it is historic in the sense that it is the first hurricane to touch US soil in nearly 4 years, and my bet is that it will be somewhat historic in the speed at which it fizzles out.

The hype over Hurricane Irene is overblown, predicts the CEO of Advanced Forecasting Corporation.

"North of Delaware, most hurricane force winds will very likely be gusts, not sustained winds."

o The demise of Irene has already begun. There is no visible eye. The storm intensity is down to 99 mph. This would be a low-end category 2 or a strong category 1 storm, while 36 hours ago some predicted a catastrophic category 4 storm. Air Force Reserve aircraft have found that Irene's eyewall has collapsed, and the central pressure has risen -- rising pressure means a weakening storm.

o The reduction in storm intensity likely confirms that this storm is not going to be as monstrous as it has been publicly forecast to be.

o Yes, it will be windy. However, north of Delaware most hurricane force winds will very likely be gusts, not sustained winds.

 

That said, I fully support Mayor Bloomberg taking the actions he is in NYC. It's not only about the winds, but the tides and flood potential. All of Long Island is very much at risk. This is not overblown in that sense. It is nice to see a proactive response. It is also good practice for what does lie ahead.
 
 
So Irene will go down in history, as did all the other hurricanes.

It's exhausting actually. My s.o. and I are taking turns running around the house yelling in a blind panic. Plus, I'm getting pretty antsy to see pictures of devastation. I mean, after the rather anti-climactic earthquake, seems something should break loose, you know?

(all kidding aside, I'm very glad it's dissipated somewhat. Could have easily gone the other way)

The last 2 post in this thread were great. Gave me a much needed laugh. Thanks
 
 
 
 
 
Some big time forecasting CEO just twittted that the storm is totally hyped by the media and will be a nothing by the time it gets to NYC. Pressure is rising and no more eyewall. Over on DRUDGE right ow.........too tired to post the link......

Alarmists are gay............they are everywhere in the science community too. Cant blame 'em though........hysterical sells.

 

The media should just ignore every storm until after the damage has occurred. That's the rightie way afterall - 20/20 hindsight, and fuck foresight because if you can't be 100% accurate there's no point.

 

How Presidential is a buffoon that announces BEFORE the hurricane ever makes any landfall, that it is Historic? All he is doing is promoting hysteria and fear. Hurricanes historically weaken at certain points. And they do not always regain strength later. It was only a Cat 3 and is now a Cat 2. Probably a Cat 1 after it passes the Outer Banks. The only thing historic about it is our President is fear mongering by using it, probably in hopes of being seen as a savior afterwards.

Instead he is likely to be seen the fool.

 

Ravi's defense of this ass? ohh he only said it MIGHT be historic. He only fear mongered a little not a lot.

For all the "concern" that has been shown for the people temporarily displaced because of flood waters where is this concern for the victims in Joplin. Havnt heard a peep about it in some time. Thousands upon thousands of people permanently displaced because their homes were either destroyed or damaged beyond habitability. There are people still living in fucking tents for christs sake. But not a peep from the DC crowd.

Everything Obama says or does is wrong. He's President Schleprock.

 
 
 
 
 
For all the "concern" that has been shown for the people temporarily displaced because of flood waters where is this concern for the victims in Joplin. Havnt heard a peep about it in some time.

Don't you usually wait until after a disaster to make judgements about it?

I'm sure Obama wants it to be bad so he can be seen as the rescuer.

Irene was a tropical storm, a big wide tropical rainstorm- not a cyclone. It dropped a lot of rain and little else. Mayor Bloomberg is a moron for shutting down the subway. He's a control freak anyway, so it's not a big surprise. This is the same patrician fascist that banned trans fat in NYC restaurants. He loves telling the filthy plebeians exactly what to do, how to do it, and when to do it. Of course he thinks we should all kiss his ring for the privilege.....  

In the end the left is to blame for the massive overreaction by local and state governments. After the incompetent Democrats in Louisiana successfully passed the blamed for their own ineptitude onto BUSH and FEMA all Politicians are running scared. They'd rather act like fools and force millions of people to evacuate from a rain storm than potentially get blamed for anything.

Everything under sealevel was destroyed. Solution to prepare for it again? Rebuild in the exact same damn spot. Idiots never learn
 
 
I'm not going to read this entire thread, but from what I can pick up from Google, President Obama said that it could be a historic hurricane and quite frankly, I think he was right. A storm that runs right up the Eastern Seaboard could have been a major disaster and if things had not gone as they did, this could have been a disaster on the level of Katrina or Andrew.

 BBC News - Hurricane Irene: Obama warns of 'historic' storm 

 
On Friday he said in a statement to reporters: "I cannot stress this highly enough: if you are in the projected path of this hurricane, you have to take precautions now.

"Don't wait, don't delay. We all hope for the best, but we have to be prepared for the worst. All of us have to take this storm seriously."

He added: "All indications point to this being a historic hurricane."

 

Irene was nothing to play with. It was a threat. I for one am glad the President took it seriously. So far 19 deaths have been attributed to Irene. It could have been much worse.

Shutting things down saved a lot of equipment, but they are by no means out of the woods.

 
When Mayor Michael Bloomberg told New Yorkers Sunday you're going to have a tough commute in the morning," he wasnt kidding.

Tropical storm Irene may have been downgraded from hurricane status, and the mandatory evacuation order was lifted by mid-afternoon Sunday. But the prospect for a quick return to normal for the regions public transit system relied upon by hundreds of thousands of commuters remains less than slim.

Transit workers were still waiting for winds to die down before they could inspect the entire system, the New York Times reported. But an initial survey revealed flooded subway tracks, powerless commuter rail networks and fallen trees and branches that had rendered some rail routes impassable.

The New Haven line of the Metro-North Railroad had no power because of downed wires along its route, the newspaper reported on its website. Parts of the Metro-North track along the surging Hudson River were flooded. Subway lines in parts of Brooklyn were also inundated. Bus service remained suspended.

Its 55% below sea level. That's not "nearly all" dufus,. The level above the sea isn't even what matters, its your elevation relative to the storm surge that matters. This is why Miami is at greater risk for devastation if a major hurricane hits. Its above sea level but right next to the fucking ocean. The coastline of the Dead Sea, hundreds of feet below sea level, on the other hand, far better protected from hurricanes.

But I know you only want the dumbed down version of reality that the media hands you.

BTW, Katrina didn't flood where I live dickhead.

Your city is so stupid they are rebuilding the levee system only to cat 3 standards. So when a cat 4 hits who ya gonna blame then? Basically asking for deaths. Eventually it will happen again, maybe then you fools will learn your lesson. Although some of your smarter residents already have. We got a huge influx of new residents after the hurricane.

The media should just ignore every storm until after the damage has occurred. That's the rightie way afterall - 20/20 hindsight, and fuck foresight because if you can't be 100% accurate there's no point.

 

How Presidential is a buffoon that announces BEFORE the hurricane ever makes any landfall, that it is Historic? All he is doing is promoting hysteria and fear. Hurricanes historically weaken at certain points. And they do not always regain strength later. It was only a Cat 3 and is now a Cat 2. Probably a Cat 1 after it passes the Outer Banks. The only thing historic about it is our President is fear mongering by using it, probably in hopes of being seen as a savior afterwards.

Instead he is likely to be seen the fool.

 

Ravi's defense of this ass? ohh he only said it MIGHT be historic. He only fear mongered a little not a lot.

 

 

One storm raking the eastern seaboard from Florida to NH is historic. I'm sure the dead people would agree.

He's still drinking beer at Martha's Vinyard when he should be organizing and bracing for Irene....his usual M.O.

 

He's the President, not the Head of FEMA.

Personally, I see no problem with his wording..... "likely historic".... not "historic"... but he was trying to convince people to evacuate. Seems perfectly reasonable.

I don't have any issue with how he has handled this one.

I see several left wingers accusing the right of wanting people to die - I see no actual evidence of right wingers wanting people to die.... so how come y'all lie about it? You should learn to recognize the difference between reality and your fantasy world.
 
 
 
 
Obama REALLY BELIEVES he and his Presidency are HISTORIC.. the lame stream media has fed him that so much...So he thinks everything he touches IS HISTORIC.  

 

I'm so relieved that Obama cut his vacation short by a full 12 hours to deal with this historic storm.

 

Exactly why was he supposed to cut short his vacation? He's not God (despite what the left would have us believe)... he cannot stop a hurricane.
 
 
 
 
This was a tough hurricane for the Republicans. In an ideal situation, thousands would have been killed and they could have crucified Obama for being unprepared

What is the purpose of this thread?

It is here to gloat that Obama is overreacting to the threat of a major hurricane. Republicans make no secret that they want Obama to fail. This extends to wanting more people to lose their jobs, for terrorists to gain power in Iraq and Afghanistan and yes for a Katrina like catastrophe to happen on Obamas watch

Unless you can provide actual evidence that Republicans want thousands of people to die, you are nothing more than a hyperbolic twit.

As I said... I see this claim often from lefties.... never see any actual proof. Your opinion of what Republicans think is not proof.... it is your stupid playing tricks on what is left of your brain.

oh dear me, waaaaa waaa waaa
And leave it to you to PRETEND you know what ALL Republicans WANT.
 
 
 
 
 
An excellent job of preparation? Seriously? FEMA didn't send out ONE search and rescue crew. They were ALL local and state. Amazing how you'll lay down for the Messiah. One preped one, WAS GOLFING.

 

Damn....sucks for you doesn't it?

You had Obama all set up and nothing happened. Just think of the anti- Obama threads you could have had if thousands were killed?

 

I've never hear a Republican pray for the death of anyone. For all the liberal pundits claim that rightwing pundits are violent assholes the only ones I've ever heard call for someone's death has been from the left. This is just one of many lefties calling for death and destruction. What was interesting is it was aired on MSNBC for everyone to see.

And you have continued to assert that you know what Republicans 'want'. It is your claim that Republicans want 'thousands' to die. Where is your evidence? Not hard - assuming there is evidence. There isn't. You know that. I know that. You're just pissed cuz I'm asking you to show how your ludicrous bullshit is based on fact.

I got the 'purpose' of the thread - another whine fest about Obama. I have already voiced my opinion of that. I said it was bullshit. I don't see that Obama did anything wrong with this one.

That, however, does not excuse your use of bullshit allegations. No matter what calculator you use - 2 wrongs do not equal 1 right.

If they could, they wouldn't be leftists.

Leftists see what they believe.
 
 
 
Not true at all! I still remember, shortly before the 2008 POTUS Election, when a bunch of Sara Palin/John McCain fans carrying a bunch of stuffed monkeys began yelling "off with his head", about Barack Obama. As a liberal, I'm no fan of his, because of the crap that he's pulled since taking office, but the kind of actions and behaviors mentioned above were totally out of bounds...and unacceptable.

 

I hope you realize that kind of crap had been going on for eight years but with President Bush as the victim and before that President Clinton was the victim.

You are right it is unacceptable.

Except that only the far left claims to know what that sign meant for sure. The sign did not specifically call for his death. It did call for an end of his Presidency. It is as likely that the pastor meant via election next year as it is his death.

By all means find it, but I was specifically referring to the leftwing claim that rightwing pundits are hatefilled violent asshats who want thousands to die. The only pundits I have ever heard call for the death of anyone has been on the lefty side. Like this wonderful person. Had she let it go at Helms getting Aids it's just a pithy insult, but to bring family into it is simply unacceptable. Yet the left does it all the time.

Hurrying home from a vacation and bitching about Republicans is neither leadership or
cooperation.
 
 
 
Don't you usually wait until after a disaster to make judgements about it?

I'm sure Obama wants it to be bad so he can be seen as the rescuer.

 

Really? So far no sign of any govt officials, no fema, no red cross.

We still have no power, if you dont have a weapon, you arnt safe in your own home at night, complete darkness, havnt seen any police, now the rumours are the union linemen have staged a slowdown.

The only reason i have power is because i'm making my own, what i'm seeing is a complete failure of liberalism during a crises, any criticism of Bush during Katrina pales at the total inaction by those who are in power now.

Signing off, i cant afford to power electronics, got to get ready for another night of chasing the vermin away, one way or another, they will be made go away.
 
 
 
God, he is clueless. So desperate for something, anything to take the spotlight off of himself.

The only thing historic is the level of his failure.

 

It was a wimpy storm. All the damage was from shoddy union labor.

It washed away because it was a shitty bridge. That storm was a wimpy storm. All the damage done was due to crappy building code, and cheap construction nothing more. I have seen three hurricanes with twice the balls as that rain storm with less damage.

What ? More important bridges here take sustained wind, not to mention heavy gusts and they are fine. Shitty bridge had no business being there.
