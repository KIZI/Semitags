Sao Tome and Principe President Fradique de Menezes nominated Friday as prime
minister Patrice Trovoada, whose opposition ADI party placed first in the
African island nation's parliamentary election.

"It is time for the country to have a government and to get to work," said
Trovoada, who made fighting corruption a key element of his campaign.

Trovoada also told journalists he plans to name leading members of civil society
to cabinet posts in addition to members of his Independent Democratic Action
(ADI) party.

Trovoada served as prime minister in 2008.

The ADI placed first in the August 1 election, winning 26 seats of 55 seats in
the parliament, leaving Trovoada two seats short of a majority.

Outgoing prime minister Rafael Branco's Liberation Movement of Sao Tome and
Principe (MLSTP) won 21 seats, and with its ally the Democratic Convergence
Party (PCD), with won seven seats, commands a narrow majority in the parliament.

Trovoada said governing with a parliamentary minority "is not a problem", noting
a previous government was able to survive with 23 seats.

"It's clear that the ADI will have a dialogue with all the other political
forces in the National Assembly," said Trovoada. "I believe one should put the
interests of the country above others."

Sao Tome and Principe has had a series fragile governments. Since 1991 and the
end of one-party rule by the MLSTP, no fewer than 14 prime ministers have headed
successive governments. An absolute majority has been won in parliament only
once, by the MLTSP in 1998.

The former Portuguese colony of 175,000 inhabitants is among the poorest
countries in the world and lives off fishing and agriculture. Its budget is
helped by international aid.

Sao Tome and Principe is one of the few countries in the Gulf of Guinea not yet
to have exploited petroleum resources, but economic and diplomatic sources have
said that the first barrels of crude oil can be envisaged for 2014.
