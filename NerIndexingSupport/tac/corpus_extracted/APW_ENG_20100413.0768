More than a year after his agent first shopped the manuscript, filmmaker John Sayles has a deal for a long historical novel.

Sayles' fictionalized account of the U.S. occupation of the Phillipines around the turn of the 20th century is tentatively titled "Some Time in the Sun." It's more than 1,000 pages in manuscript form.

It will be released in 2011 by McSweeney's, the San Francisco-based press founded by author Dave Eggers.

Sayles is best known for such films as "Eight Men Out" and "Matewan." He's also the author of several books. He has lamented that he couldn't find a publisher for his new work.

McSweeney's editor Jordan Bass said Tuesday that the novel "felt like equal parts (E.L.) Doctorow and `Deadwood'" and praised its "captivating pacing."
