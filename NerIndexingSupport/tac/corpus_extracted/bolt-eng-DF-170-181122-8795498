Who really ever knows that answer...

But what a shame... grasshopper is no more.

Accidentally hung himself in his hotel room closet, with curtain rope?
 
 
I loved him in Kill Bill. Was it the five point palm heart exploding technique that did him in?

suicide. why?

 

Who really ever knows that answer...

 

Suicide is usually due to depression of some sort. It's difficult for most to understand since most people don't deal with that type of depression. But as you said, no one ever really knows the answer for certain.

And that would be a "natural" cause too!

A 73 year-old can still "get it up?" Viagra?

or maybe he's in good shape. 73 isn't that old though i'm afraid i've never polled a bunch of 70 plus-ers to see if their plumbing still works.

I loved those movies too.. RIP Mr. Carradine!

Did they actually determine that that's how Hutchence died? I thought that was just a crazy rumor.

It's what they think happened because there was no suicide note and he was naked.
 
 
this is a goddamn shame. I really liked David Carradine.

suicide. why?

 

i would guess for the same reasons hunter s. did....you get to the point where you are just old...no one notices you....look at how rich and famous both men were...but they could not handle old.....

"getting old ain't for sissies" bette davis
 
 
Yeah this is sad... and quite a shock.

Mental is my new favorite show. I saw that preview too - bet they won't pull the episode. Unfortunately, his death will probably just get more people to watch.
 
 
Wiki:

 David Carradine - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 
 
On June 4, 2009, Carradine was found dead in his room at the Swissotel Nai Lert Park Hotel on Wireless Road, near Sukhumvit, in central Bangkok, Thailand.[2][3] A police official said Carradine was found hanging by a rope in the room's closet.[13][14] Meanwhile, the Bangkok Post reported that his body was found curled up in the wardrobe with a shoelace tied around his penis and neck.[15]

Khunying Pornthip Rojanasunand, a flamboyant Thai forensic pathologist and Director of Forensic Science Institute, stated the incident met four of the criteria for accidental death involving Autoerotic asphyxiation. Pol Lt Gen Worapong Chewprecha, Commander of the Metropolitan Police, remarked that the closed circuit television installed within the hotel supported the theory that no other persons were involved with the death.[16][17][18][19] Carradine's representative and family members told the press that they believed the death to be accidental and not a suicide.[20]

Carradine was in Bangkok to shoot his latest movie, Stretch, but the film crew were aware of his absence when they went to dine out at a restaurant on June 3

 
 
 
I read on that valuable and infallible news-source known as Twitter that ""A rope was attached to David Carradine's neck and penis. Auto-erotic sex act?"

Hung by his own rope. The man is a legend.

Twitter with me people, Twitter with me.

 Twitter: What are you doing? 
 
 
David is dead, too late to save grasshopper now. Save yourselves, Twitter with JW Frogen.

Imagine how galling it must have been for Brandon Lee to lose a fight to David Carradine when Carradine had stolen his Dad's role...
 
 
Sad to see, I have the original King Fu on DVD, still an entertaining show after all these years.
 
 
So long, Grasshopper...

One does not 'twitter', one 'tweets'.

Why one would do so is beyond comprehension.
 
 
If it was accidental, (and it looks like it must have been) what an embarrassing way to die.
 
 
This is the best news I have had in 30 years. Mr. Hilda finally gets knocked off the top spot in the Celebrity Pervert Death list.

That's exactly what my husband & I were talking about. We remember Kung Fu him as "grasshopper" from the 70's. It was one our favorite shows.
 
 
Lyrics to parody song done!

It's sung to "One Night In Bangkok" by Murray Head. Recording coming soon!

Lyrics:

NEWS REPORTER:

In other news, David Carradine of Kung Fu fame was found dead in the closet of his hotel room in Bangkok with a shoelace tied around his neck and his penis. The death has been ruled accidental...

COMPANY:

One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble
Not much between despair and ecstasy
One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble
Can't be too careful with your company
I can feel the devil walking next to me

THE AMERICAN:

Bangkok, Oriental city
And the city don't know what the city is yet
The creme de la creme of the perv world and a
Show with everything but David Carradine

Time flies -- doesn't seem a minute
Since the kung fu show had grasshopper in it
All change -- don't you know that when you
Play at this level it's no ordinary venue

It's ropes -- or the leather -- or handcuffs -- or --
or shoelaces!!

COMPANY:

One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble
Not much between despair and ecstasy
One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble
Can't be too careful with your company
I can feel the devil walking next to me

THE AMERICAN:

One town's very like another
When your rope's tied around yer penis, brother

COMPANY:

It's a drag, it's a bore, it's really such a pity
To be looking at the board, not looking at the city

THE AMERICAN:

Whaddya mean? Ya seen one crowded, polluted, stinking town --

COMPANY:

Tea, girls, warm, sweet
Some are set up in the Somerset Maugham suite

THE AMERICAN:

Get Tied! You're talking bout a dude
Who died doing what he loved to do!
He got his kicks below the waistline, sunshine

COMPANY:

One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble
Not much between despair and ecstasy
One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble
Can't be too careful with your company
I can feel the devil walking next to me

THE MYTHBUSTERS:

We have determined that the myth is confirmed -- you CAN die masturbating while choking yourself. We recommend you do NOT try this at home. The shamwow guy does this, do you want to be like him?

THE AMERICAN:

Too bad, there wasn't a witness
To his ultimate test of cerebral fitness
This grips me more than would the
Shoelace around his penis brotha...

And thank God I'm only hearing this crap -- not seeing it --

I better not see you guys playing
With ropes and strings, masturbating
I bet, you watch, I would just shoot you
But the strings we use would not quite suit you

So you better go back to your bars, your wives, your massage
parlours --

COMPANY:

One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble
Not much between despair and ecstasy
One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble
Can't be too careful with your company
I can feel the devil walking next to me

 Carradine's "Deviant Sexual Behavior" - June 5, 2009 
 
 
The most facinating part of David Caridine's life does not belong to David, but rather to Barbara Hershey (great name), a woman so endowed with life force she ate her own placenta giving birth to David's child.

Is this true?

Yes, because I WANT to believe it.
 
 
As promised.... The song!

No wonder my garden sucks!

No spirit will protect me, and I was holding my son when my wife's placenta was placed gently into the cold, sterile night.

Agent and family insisting this was murder.... Officials in Bangkok disagree. Meanwhile, the smoking gun has a quite revealing story about Carradine's most recent divorce. Seems gwashoppa was quite the perv, not only engaging in the behavior that killed him, but also was in an admitted "incestuous" sexual affair with a "close female relative."
