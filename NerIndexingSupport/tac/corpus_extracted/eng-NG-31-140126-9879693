What the heck were the Jets wearing?

I don't remember them ever having tose uniforms - do they go all the way
back to the days when they were the New York Titans?

Those are the Titans Unis circa 1962-1963. Â The Coaches were wearing
Titans caps, along with "Titans of New York" Sweaters/Sweatshirts.

This is the second time this year the jets have donned the Titans colors.

This is just too hard to resist.

Bobby, the Jets figured they would try to get the Fins to think they were
playing the Michigan Wolverines so they would feel like they have a chance.

Well, I'm sure the Dolphins were relieved to find it wasn't the Steelers
all over again ... for a little while ...

According to a Jets fan, wearing a Jets jersey today in a sports bar,
"they are the Jet's away jerseys", need I say more? Good thing the
Dolphins weren't wearing those Godawful orange jerseys, she would have
REALLY been confused then.

Those were pretty nice, I thought.

Next game the Fins would wear Ft. Lauderdale Striker throwbacks, but the
Strikers used to score more....
