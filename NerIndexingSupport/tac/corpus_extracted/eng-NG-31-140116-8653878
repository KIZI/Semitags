This motley crew of liars & cheats is done......pull the plug on them.

They have a head coach who just received the biggest fine in sports history, and
who's been exposed to the world as a liar who can only win football games by
systematic and pervasive cheating.  By the way, he cheats on his wife too.  A
real subhuman piece of slime, folks.

They have a QB who shows minimal competence by relying on a coach who feeds him
illegal information during games obtained by cheating and stealing.  Plus, he
shows total disregard for morality by fathering bastard children with women he
uses as incubators for his foul offspring whom he has no intention to
financially support despite making millions of dollars lying & cheating in his
profession.  A real asshole.

They just hired the most over-hyped wide receiver in the history of the
NFL.....another cheating, overpaid lazy jigaboo who famously stated "I play when
I wanna play" and once stated the horrific 1970 plane crash that killed the
entire Marshall University football team "....really wasnt nothing big".

The only decent player & human being they ever had on that team was the
kicker......but he wisely chose to be traded to a team that can win Super Bowls
with hard work, talent, and determination.....not cheating every chance they
get.

New England Patriots.....Biggest Disgrace in the History of Sports......CASE
CLOSED.

Those salty tears running down your cheeks pretty bitter to taste, bub?

Get used to them.....your team is now the laughingstock of the entire sports
world and will be for a long, long time.

It amazes me how fans of these Old AFC Elite teams (Raiders/Steelers)
get so fucking jealous of the Patriots every season, it's sickening.
It's as if they can't stand having their collected asses handed to
them every season by some Yankee football team, while their collective
franchises haven't accomplished anything of note in over three
decades, beyond choking to the Tampa Bay Suckaneers, and having a
corrupt officiating crew award them Superbowl XL despite the fact that
they were totally outplayed and outclassed, respectively.  Along with
people who root for the Iggles, they're the biggest bunch of asshole
fans in the NFL. Must have something to do with coming from a shitty
redneck-infested Confederate-wannabe state like Pennsylvania.
