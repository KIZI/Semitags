HI All,
Renowned social activist Carlos Mauricio and his Caravan for Justice
will be visiting ASU this Tuesday.  Join us for a deeply compelling,
first-hand account of the effects of torture on the people of the
Americas and ways that our community may strengthen our stand *against*
torture and *for* the rights of people's movements.  More details below.
FYI, you can read blogs from the caravan underway at:

Thank you to the many  co-sponsors of this talk -
See you Tuesday!

Torture, Impunity, and the Struggle for Justice:
A Torture Survivor Tells His Story

Carlos Mauricio
Founder, The Stop Impunity Project

Tuesday, November 6
4:00-6:00 p.m.
Payne Building Rm 129
Arizona State University
Maps of campus available at: http://www.asu.edu/map/
+++++++++++++

Carlos Mauricio was a professor at the University of El Salvador in
1983, when he was kidnapped from his classroom, forced into an unmarked
van, and tortured at National Police headquarters.  Two decades later,
Mauricio and two others convinced a U.S. jury that former Salvadoran
Ministers of Defense were responsible for their detention and torture.
This lawsuit is one of the first in U.S. history in which military
commanders were found guilty for the abuses of their subordinates.  The
significance of this victory cannot be overstated at a moment when human
rights advocates are struggling to establish responsibility for torture
in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere.

In this talk, Mauricio will recount his experiences in clandestine
prison cells in El Salvador, and the parallels between his experience
and that of other prisoners, including those tortured in Abu Ghraib.  He
will discuss the growing popular movement to close the School of the
Americas (SOA), the U.S. Army facility that has trained 60,000+ Latin
American soldiers in interrogation and counterinsurgency.  Graduates of
the SOA are responsible for some of the worst human rights abuses in the
hemisphere.   Carlos will also share his recent experiences traveling to
Burma and witnessing the atrocities committed by the military junta
there, and ways to support the Burmese people in their call for justice.
