Japan has pledged an additional sum of up to 10 million dollars in emergency aid
to flood-ravaged Pakistan, the government said Tuesday, following pleas for help
from Islamabad and the United Nations.

"The government of Japan decided to extend emergency grant aid of up to 10
million US dollars to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan in response to the
disastrous floods caused by the unprecedented heavy rain," the foreign ministry
said in a statement Tuesday.

The aid is on top of three million dollars Japan announced on August 3.

Pakistan is enduring its worst floods in 80 years, with millions of people
affected by the deluge, prompting UN chief Ban Ki-moon to urge the world to step
up international aid.
