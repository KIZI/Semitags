 
 
Which country poses the greatest threat to world peace?
 
 
And why?
 
 
Russia, and their obvious aspirations of returning to being the power and influence they once were.
 
 
It is America obviously
 
 
Israel, simply because they get away with things no other international entity would.
Only a matter of time before a backlash occurs.
 
 
Well, it can't be America now that Bush has gone. So it must be the Little Devil (Israel) because, y'know, it controls everything.

More seriously though, it's got to be either Russia who seem to want their Empire back or else Iran who seem to want to create a new hegemony in the Middle East. Or possibly Pakistan who look like they might get to give nukes to crazed Islamists before Iran do.

Yes, but America is acting in Israel's behalf. If it weren't for the Israel lobby in the US, the American Empire would be half the size and its behavior far more benign.

Them or China. But China would proabably react to actions of the USA, so my original suggestion stands!

It can't be China. As a Chinese, I have to say China is becoming more and more strong now. but we are a nation pursuing peace. After New China bulit from 1949, We never attack any country. but USA, you know, it has joined many war in the world in recent years. It has too many millitary bases.

Yeah, like when it attacked Iraq in 1991 to free Kuwait, or when it bombed Serbia to stop the massacre and genocide of Bosnians, or when it bombed Afghanistan to help get rid of the dictatorial Taliab or when it invaded Iraq in 2003 to remove Saddam Hussein. Yep, no doubt the world would be more peaceful if we just let the bad guys get on with what they're doing.

Oh dear. I think brandishing the anti-semitic slur to stifle all criticism of Israel and its fifth columnists is a bit old now. I think it lost all traction when the Zionists hurled it at Jimmy Carter and John Mearshimer. Who's next, Dennis Kucinich and Gerald Kaufmann? It just shows Zionism itself is morally bankrupt (how can racism and genocide be anything else?) and is clutching at straws.

Right, 'cos there's no similarity at all between the Nazis saying that Jews control the world and you saying the "Israel Lobby" controls the world. Yeah, the two are so completely different that pointing out the similarity is just "playing a card" to "stifle" criticism.

Who are you to say who's bad? Killing 1.1 million civilians for oil, Israel and empire is bad in my book.

Launching a war against a militia the US had created and fighting it with warlords who are five times as brutal, even toward women, isn't nice either. And why Afghanistan rather than Saudi? Nothing to do with terrorism that war. The fact Saudi was a docile supplier of oil and the Taliban were getting cold feet on the pipeline deal the US had been negotiating explains why.

The Balkans conflict was a post Cold War American/NATO power grab and riddled with double standards (Turkey killed thousands more separatist Kurds than Milosevic and his allies killed Muslims).

Oh dear, where to start.

Did the US kill 1.1 million civilians? No
Did they invade Iraq for oil? No
Did they do it for Israel? No
Did they do it for empire? No

Does the fact that the US had previously funded the terrorist group prevent them from destroying it? No
Is the democratically Afghan government as bad as the Taliban? No
Is the Saudi government as bad as the Taliban? No
Did the Saudi government establish training camps for international Islamist terrorists? No

Was the attack on Serbia a NATO power grab? No

Are you just a) ignorant and b) desperately looking for ways to blame The Israel Lobby America for all the world's ills? Looks like it
Is this a way for you to avoid accepting the fact that the West is generally Good while the Islamist terrorists who go around blowing themselves up, beheading people, torturing and maiming are generally Bad? You tell me.
 
 
I simply cannot believe the ammount of people here who believe that Israel is a threat to world peace. When have they ever threatened other states to wipe them off the face of the Earth?... hmm reminds me of Iran? The evidence is indisputable that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad wants to obtain a nuclear weapon and he has said that he will use it to wipe out Israel.. so it's Israels fault isn't it! The moral compass of some of the people here is so incorrect and so anti-semetic. Some of you are just looking at a way to attack Israel and if you can't attack Israel you attack America because of they're close connections.

If anything Islamic Fundamentalism is the biggest threat to world peace, wake up and smell the coffee, I didn't see Israel or Jews flying a 747 into the WTC. The logic that some apply is the same as blaming the Jews for what happened to them in the holocaust, absolutely ridiculos.

If the US had not invaded, 1.1 million people, according to the British Medical Journal, would still be alive. If the US hadn't have imposed sanctions in the 1990s, another million would now be with us.

The US, coaxed on by AIPAC and Israeli fifth columnists such as Norman Podhoretz and Bill Kristol, invaded Iraq because it thought it could control its oil and open a new market for its products. It's an old story with at least a century-old pedigree. Empire on the cheap, as the likes of Hillary Clinton and Republican realists thought it would be. So yes, Cheney and the realists thought it was in the interests of the US, but the neocons, most of them Straussians who sought to create a highly militarized, regimented, morally pure and Spartan country at home, and a Greater Israel abroad, knew better, and led an establishment made stupid by its own greed to commit the gravest war crime since Vietnam.

Depends what you mean by "bad." Both the Taliban and the House of Saud are "bad." The US doesn't care what a government does to its people. It would rather have a docile dictatorship that a democracy willing to stand up to imperialism. So I assume you're not talking about "bad" in the human rights sense, as that doesn't matter **** to the Americans. If by "bad" you mean sponsor terrorism, there were elements in both regimes which were "bad". Just one gives the US as much oil as it wants and the other was standing up to the US over the pipeline. Guess which one got it.

Your perception of good and bad is ridiculous. A stealth bomber killing 50 innocent people for political reasons is worse than a suicide bomber who does the same to 10 people.

What do you expect these people to do? Sit around while Zionists bulldoze their houses, starve them, destroy their schools, murder them for sport in many well documented cases, make them drive on substandard roads while blocking aid to pregnant women as they bleed to death? Would you just sit back and think, oh, Israel and the West are good, so I'll let this one go, if the boot was, literally, on the other foot?
 
 
The PRC. I don't think people understand the gravity of Chinese intervention in global affairs. They're threatening Taiwan, they've had political standoffs with Japan, they give weapons to North Korea, Sudan, they sponsored CTs all over Africa and Asia during the cold war (and would be doing so now if they hadn't unfortunately won), they sell weapons to Iran and other Middle Eastern states and generally are a threat to world peace.

1) It's not anti-semitic to attack Israel. Just as it's not anti-Islamic for you to criticize Iran, though in many cases this is precisely why you do it.

2) 9/11 was a terrible crime, but it was neither the first nor the greatest.

3) Ahmadinejad did not say he wanted Israel wiped off the map. He said he wanted it removed from the pages of history, later going further to express that he wished it would disintegrate as a political entity like the USSR did. So don't tell lies.

OK, but his point was that 9/11 prompted the US response. I don't necessarily believe that (I believe in blowback theory) but the fact is that it was a direct attack on the United States intended to cause the most damage to as many civilians as possible and enrage the United States into going into war.

"Our dear Imam said that the occupying regime must be wiped off the map and this was a very wise statement. We cannot compromise over the issue of Palestine. Is it possible to create a new front in the heart of an old front."

Looking at his ACTUAL speech, he points to (before he says that it was a wise statement) the "Eastern Empire" and how it no longer appears on maps... he makes no comment as to how it no longer appears on maps, simply that it ceased to. There is no commitment to peace in his speech. This is what the Imam said: "This regime that is occupying Qods [Jerusalem] must be eliminated from the pages of history."

Eliminated? Peaceful? I think not.
 
 
With absolute certainty beyond any doubt without the mildest hesitation it is unquestionably and most definitely Switzerland.

 http://web.archive.org/web/200709272...news_id=200247  from an Iranian broadcaster so I doubt there is a zionist influence there..

"As the Imam said, Israel must be wiped off the map," said Ahmadinejad, referring to the late founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Imam Khomeini. He may of changed his mind later about what he said, but he said it.

I voted Israel - they are constantly starting wars which have much wider influences. Whilst the fighting may be in Lebanon or Palestine the ideology derived from the resistance movements in these regions is strengthened every time Israel attacks, and it is this set of ideas - of Jihad - that is the gravest threat to world peace.

United States is a close second. A declining world power trying to enforce claims to global hegemony with a right-wing (by global standards) political basis at home.

I'm surprised by the ranking of Iran - it might talk the talk about nuclear weapons but they know if they use one in a war the rest of the world would reduce Iran to a nation of shepherds looking after flocks of mutated and sick sheep.

That's the most logically inverted thinking I've seen in a while.

Why are Israel the biggest danger? Because the Islamist who pose a real world danger feed off Israel's wars of self-defence to gain more power to wreak more havoc. So why exactly is it Israel that poses the danger and not the Islamists (or Iran that backs them to the hilt?)

No they are not "the biggest supporters of Islamic extremism" considering that Osama Bin Laden calls for the destruction for the I quote "infidel" Pakistani goverment and "corrupt" Saudi government.

One of Al-Qaeda's main objectives is to topple what it percieves as the despotic monarchies of the middle east. Furthermore, Pakistan has mobilized 80,000 troops in the North West Frontier Province to combat the 'Pakistani Taliban' compared with the 50,000 NATO troops in Afghanistan.

The Pakistani army (and police) in the region has also sustained 1500 fatalities while NATO forces have sustained 1000. Note that the Pakistani government is taking part in this war even though there is a HUGE amount of domestic pressure (frequent suicide bombings) against this war.

Perhaps what you meant to say was that elements in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia support extremism and only a moron would disagree with that.

You shouldnt make such assumptions after reading one article mate.

And to answer the question in the poll, I think Islamic Extremism is the number one threat to "world peace", with Russia, America and Israel tied at second.
 
 
America.

Who wants world peace? It'd just destory our planets economy.

All those people in the military supporting families. Having no jobs. Nothing to do. All those civilian companies on military contracts providing food/equipment/man power etc. Having no jobs. All those poor people in the BBC/CNN/SKY with nothing to repeat over and over 100 times a day.

War ftw.
 
 
with bush still in power, clearly US, now Israel might have quite good chances as well (supported by the US though^^)...

I'm not sure whether your comment was sarcastic or not, but anyway:
Who wants BBC/CNN/SKY reports on wars and deaths all the day? Who would want to know about the many single deaths by accident (which is not really related to world peace, but anyway...), like a teenager who died after he did something stupid? I believe there are many people out there yearning for more positive, optimistic news reports.
And in fact, war is what keeps those poor journalists busy on the same thing all the time...

The question made no presumptions about "cause" or "who is right" merely threat to world peace. You are misunderstanding what was asked. The actions of Israel cause the most violence in the world, attacks and tensions. Clearly Israel is the greatest danger to world peace.

watch what you say boy,
Israelis are living in middle east illegally, the land belongs to the palestinians. The same Palestinians that were chucked out and killed given poor food jobs etc. The world will not rest until the zionist movement is stopped and they leave the land. No one will forgive, no one will forget no matter how many innocent children are killed
BRAP!

Erm, no. Clearly the Islamists who actually carry out the violent attacks are the greatest danger to world peace.

Or do you perhaps subscribe to the racist view that Islamists don't really have a choice, that they simply have to respond to Israel's actions with mindless and extreme violence against all sorts of people?

I thought this would be a serious discussion but really it's just more stupid 'I hate Israel/Palestine because my local fuhrer said they're like, evil capitalist pigs/terrorists man and they have spies in every major public body in the West/have innocent children sat around and there[sic] army/terrorists are actually KILLING PEOPLE oh no!' gash.

Civilian deaths are tragic, justifiable self defence is not. Using human shields and firing purposely from within crowded civilian areas to increase civilian loss of life is truly horrific.

I voted USA because it is the highest consumer of oil. 25% of the worlds oil.

Oil is predicted to peak in production within the next five years, the American life style and the encouragement of the culture of consumerism, to which America is the supreme example of, is destroying the planet and will lead us into the age of post-oil collapse.
 
 
The US, no doubt.

And that too in the name of anti terrorism. Problem is, the media feeds people the wrong info, so they think they're doing 'the right thing' by killing thousands of innocent people by bombing entire countries to find one man (eg Saddam, Laden).

Hope all that changed with Obama.
 
 
At the moment, the US. Possibly later, China.

Jeez, you must be a Mossad spokesperson. Never seen the video of Donald Rumsfeld (good ol' Rummie) embracing that madman Saddam Hussein back in the 80s. Its common knowledge that Uncle Sam supplied Saddam with weapons to gas the poor kurdish peoples.
Wake up dude
 
 
Yeah your right i should make my list more accurate shouldn't I..
why don't i just include the many Islamic terrorist bombings that have occured in the Middle East, where the blood of many innocent muslims has been spilt or was all that an illusion.
The planes flying into the twins towers - illusion. Great camera tricks i must say.
The blood of the many innocents being treated for severe burns and injuries...illusion. They must have had some great make-up artists on standby.
And the piles of dead bodies - wow what technology capable of today.
It aint illusion - it's delusion. You seem to have it in abundance!
 
 
The USA definitely.
I'm sure we all contribute in some way, but the problem with the US is that they can enter Wars and kill millions as a way of obtaining 'peace for all mankind' - they somehow believe that they can bomb everyone into their way of thinking, but that's not peace, that's a dictatorship.

The old "we supported him so we cannot dare do anything to stop him now" argument is as pathetic and morally (let alone logically) bankrupt now as it was then. And good to see it with its companion "we sold them weapons" line which is factually completely ridiculous since the US and UK combined contrived to sell less than 1% of all weapons imported into Iraq between 1970-ish and 2003. Most came from Russia and France. But then I guess that's OK because France were following the rule you like to lay down which is that if you give a nutter a knife you're not allowed to try and stop the nutter using it.

Question

Why is Iran perceived to be a threat? With the allegations (belief to some) that it has nuclear weapons and also it plans to use them against the West, why are people so keen to believe it after the fiasco that was Iraq? It seems like dejavu again and I would really like to know why so many people feel Iran is a threat to the world.

Although, now Obama's President, I really do hope America becomes better and more respectable, But, the unfortunate truth is, the majority of Americans I have talked to within the past two years have been your stereotypical retards who are blindly patriotic and believe every other country is ****. The amount of abuse I've received just for nto being American is ridiculous!

What was the US doing in Korea? Stoking the flames of the Cold War it needed for it's imperial expansion, that's what. And Chinese involvement in Indochina was marginal. America killed 3.2 million people there.

China has a greater claim to moral legitimacy than the US. Hopefully its rise is swift and it can balance yankee some time in our lifetimes.

I'm not going to comment on that because I don't know of the state of the relationship between the IAEA and Iran, and how it differed to their relationship with Iraq. But anonymity between a state and the IAEA is never enough to accuse that state of having something to hide, as we witnessed with Iraq. So is there any actual evidence to prove that they are indeed developing nuclear weapons, and that they intend to use those weapons? Has any Western country come forward and backed up their fear rhetoric with anything substantial?

Kill millions? When was the last time we did that?  

And how is that a dictatorship? And how are peace and dictatorships comparable in any way?

It is? Because as far as I know, religion didn't start the Iraq War, the Gulf War, the Vietnam War, the Korean War, WWII, WWI, the American Civil War, the English Civil War, the 7 Years War, the War of 1812, the Napoleonic Wars, the French Revolution, the American Revolution, uh..... well I can keep going, but you get the point I think.

Religion as the root of violence is seriously one of the most overplayed, clichéd, inaccurate ideas out there.

Actually, we were there since WWII. It had nothing to do with the Cold War. And imperial expansion? That's an ironic thing to hear from a Brit. But since when is South Korea an imperial colony of the United States? This is news to me.

 
China has a greater claim to moral legitimacy than the US. Hopefully its rise is swift and it can balance yankee some time in our lifetimes.
 

Totally. What with its massacres of its own people for protesting, and the way it's the biggest polluter in the world and refuses to do a thing about it (and before you even say anything, the U.S. is definitely doing something about its own pollution problems), and the way it persecutes religion, and the way it executes more prisoners than any other industrialized nation, and how they like to support ethnic cleansing in Darfur, or the way that they allow almost no freedom of speech whatsoever.... oh goodness, now I'm just listing.

But yeah! I see what you're saying. They're so much more moral than the U.S. I hope to see them rise as high as us as well, I'd love to see American cultural exports to be replaced with communism and political oppression.

Thats right terrorist Israel, which supplies terrorists like Hamas and Hezbollah with missiles merely to attack another country.
which threaten to wipe other countries off the face of the earth, which enforce beheadings, stonings and the blinding of people with acid as well as many other barbaric medieval practices. A terrorist country that encourages people to watch the executions of their nationals. Where women are inferior, and where minorities are persecuted (e.g. bahai's)
Yep thank g-d for Iran fighting them bloody terrorists.

No the 'evidence' is practically zilch, Iran has the right to enrich uranium for civilian purposes (due to signing the NPT, unlike other nuclear powers). Even the Russians, the IAEA and even the USA (  http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/12/...ear/index.html  ) say Iran isn't producing a weapons program.
 
 
Why delete my post calling Israel a vile entity--which it is? How can you possibly be a patriotic Englishman and support Israel, whose terrorist founders killed so many Englishmen in cold blood, not to mention the genocide of the Palestinians in the catastrophe of 1948. Anybody who lives in the UK and supports Israel should just **** off and live there.

Everybody hates your country aside from Jews and fundamentalist Christians in the US and some crazy Henry Jackson Society members in the UK. You are the most hated country on the planet. Can't you get that? Why is it? Is it because we are anti-Semites? Come on. It's because we are humans and we see the inhumanity of your soldiers, your government, and now your people. Where were PeaceNow? Where are the demonstrators. Either too scared to raise moral voice in apartheid Israel or too wicked. One suspects the former.

More seriously though, it's got to be either Russia who seem to want their Empire back or else Iran who seem to want to create a new hegemony in the Middle East. Or possibly Pakistan who look like they might get to give nukes to crazed Islamists before Iran do.

 

The latter portion is less serious an analysis; I seriously hope so, otherwise it reflects poorly on your intellect.

The crazy Zionists controlling USA and USA itself is the most dangerous threat to world peace. Both are nuclear armed, have killed millions of innocents in last few years alone without any repercussions and only bent on doing more.

None of Russia, Iran or Pakistan fits that bill. They are in some ways pitted against USA and the Zionist entity, so I can understand your sympathy for the Zionists.

However it's the Zionists and their amerikan benefactors that pose the greatest threat to world peace. For crying out loud the list of war crimes of these mindless morons is too long to mention. The only ones to have ever used nuclear bombs, that too on civilians?

Different levels of enrichment are required for different applications.

The enrichment level that Iran is reaching is not needed for nuclear power,
but only for nuclear weapons.

Dunno. Some people claim Israel has nuclear power, but there's not proof.
For all we know, Israel might be intentionally bluffing regarding it's nuclear arsenal.

It would not be wise to call, though.

Israel is not in a popularity competition. As long as it can defend it's existence, it doesn't make any difference what people think. People will always hate Jews anyway, that's the whole point behind the establishment of Israel.

 
Where were PeaceNow? Where are the demonstrators. Either too scared to raise moral voice in apartheid Israel or too wicked. One suspects the former.
 

Actually Peace Now demonstrate quite a lot. They are allowed to because Israel is a democracy.

1) Which court? Nothing is voluntary in this case.

2) By nuking Israel's nuclear sites.

3) Because it's the moral thing to do. It would save a people from genocide. As your own defense spokesman said, there is a "holocaust" in Gaza. We said never again. We destroyed the first bunch of Nazis. Hopefully we can do the same again. Your state is religiously Jewish. Their state may be Islamic. Matters **** to me.

You don't need a court to sell land, you simply sign a contract.
It was purchased by a company called "Menucha Venachala" in 1890
(before the british mandate!)

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehovot 

BTW, the Weizmann institute of science and technology is here. One of the professors is Adi Shamir. He's the "S" in RSA, which means that every secure transaction you made over the internet/credit card/whatever until 2003 (when the patent expired), he made money of. Kinda sucks for you, doesn't it?

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adi_Shamir 

BTW, I lived most of my life in Petach Tiqva, which is built on land a that was purchased from a person called "Salim Kasser". You can still find the documents in the Austrian archives today.

 
2) By nuking Israel's nuclear sites.
 

Doesn't that mean Israel will nuke London as well?

Religiously Jewish? I don't even believe in god.

But as they say - a picture is worth a thousand words:

Why not? I mean - if the Palestinians are going to live under an Islamic tyranny, then there's no issue of freedom here.

In order to be illegal something has to break a law - do you know the history? That is the question here.

I think it is very telling that you put your trust in China Russia and the arab world - surely you can see that these places are really just horrible extreme dictatorships?

I also generally find that people who compare Israel with the Nazis know very little about either: do you have any idea how offensive that statement is to jews? If it had a grounding in truth i could accept it, but it clearly just doesnt.

Iran has every right to enrich uranium in its own country (under NPT guidelines), it is an independent country and shouldn't rely on Russia for its technological advancements. But after-all the Russians are helping out themselves by helping to build the plant in Bushehr.

Sure, sure, but that's why many people suspect it's really after a nuclear bomb.

 
Was Mordchai Vannunu lying?
 

Vanunu was a very low class technician. He has no understanding of nuclear processes, let alone nuclear weapons. He might be telling the truth, but that would be like a bad clock - still shows the right time sometimes.

Operation Vela, widely believed to be an Israeli-South African test.

I, for example, am quite afraid of this possibility. It's very clear to me that Iran is going to use this weapon against me. Maybe even deliver it to Hizbullah or Hamas, who know. I would do everything within my power to prevent it.

That doesn't rule out the possibility that Israel is bluffing. Vanunu was signed on a non-disclosure agreement which he violated, so that's enough to put him in jail, regardless of what he did or didn't know. After all - it does make you suspect that Israel has an a-bomb, doesn't it?

 
Operation Vela, widely believed to be an Israeli-South African test.
 

Nobody knows what that was. Besides - most agencies in the world think Israel had nuclear weapons even before that, even during the war of 73.

I'm saying that a people who enforce their values of peace on others using violence will not obtain peace but control. Control is a dictatorship.

Relax, even if this did happen, every Iranian town and city would be razed, noone would risk it, nukes are just a deterrent mechanism, thats their purpose.

What you say makes sense, but when you put nukes in the hands of religious people who constantly call to wipe Israel off the map - I'm not sure they think the way you do.

Maybe they think that god will stop Israel's nukes from falling on them, or that all Iranians will go to heaven? Who knows what crazy stuff goes through their heads?

As it doesn't seem that US is going to give Israel a green light to attack Iran's nuclear plant, all I can do is hope that you are right.

Which means that if Israel is bluffing then it's actually quite successful.

I think you are overreacting (in bold) and in the interest of fairness, both sides have their nutters, have you seen the Christian evangelicals.... *shudder*

... and if Israel were bluffing, a very risky move, but they prob. 98.5% not bluffing, even so I dont see why they need nukes, why dont they just get covered by the USA's arsenal

When the nukes were developed (if they were), the relations between US and Israel were not as strong as today. This project supposedly started in the 60's, mainly with french assistance.

Besides, you could also ask why Israel needs the IDF in the first place if it can count on the U.S - the answer is it cant. US has it's own interests at the end of the day.

Firstly I want a source.
Secondly, regarding one of these buildings, it has emerged that the UN has backed down from claims that a UN school in the Jabalya refugee camp was hit in an Israeli airstrike.

How many media outlets have reported this? very few.

I find it outrageous that the truth hasn't been reported with anywhere near the same vigour as the false accusations.

I thought the question was: Which country poses the greatest threat to world peace?

IMO It's not the individual country, but the clash between the individual country with the standards set by the world's most powerful, most developed countries (read: the Western World) that possesses the greatest threat to world peace. Of course, there are individual countries such as North Korea and Iran that go straight against Western principles, but as long as they are isolated cases, they possess little threat. But when they combine their power and act as a block against the West, and when e.g. Iran is able to push its neighbours into joining Iran in a joint fight against the West, that is the real threat.

But how will these blocks be created? Will it be the "dissident" countries of the present, or will the shift of power, the development of developing countries into countries with a stronger presence and voice in the world, eventually cause new blocks to arise? I personally believe the latter is more likely to produce a new giant threat to the Western world.

Of course AIPAC influences American foreign policy to a certain extent. But the common view that "ZOMG the zionists like, totally control America" is really quite silly.

AIPAC is not the biggest lobby in america. Lobbies focussed on rifles, helping the aged, small businesses and trial lawyers are all bigger. Further, lobbies in America, while more powerful than similar groups in, for example, the UK, are not the be all and end all of politics. If you look at sources of campaign funding and compare the views of constituencies with the policies supported by congressmen it is clear that lobbies are only a part of a large web of motivations for politicians.

FP is, compared to other areas of politics, largely separated from congress anyway (congress is far more susceptable to influence by lobbies than the executive).

America has its own strategic reasons for supporting israel - it feels threatened by islamism and sees israel as an ally in the middle east. It is clear that ideologically israel is the closest country in the world to america. On a practical level, since the mid 1970s Israel has been pretty much the sole source of US intelligence information regarding the arab states (this has changed recently but the CIA still work very closely with the Mossad/Shin Bet/Amman), and israel is a tactical partner for america. (source Raviv and Melman (1990))

Lobbies exist for everything from Irish Americans to supporting Cypriot national interests. What about the National Beer Wholesalers Association (this is a huge lobby, almost as big as AIPAC) - do they control america? Is that why americans drink so much beer? Obviously it is a part of the reason, but really its just because beer is a tasty and refreshing beverage...

America is no doubt influenced by AIPAC however people exaggerate this influence massively. Things like the war in iraq/afghanistan and pressure on Iran would all be happening without AIPAC.

Obviously there is no way of ultimately revealing the truth about this issue, but personally i think it is fairly obvious that AIPAC is just another large American lobby exerting some influence over some decisions.
 
 
Probably Iran as they would be involved in Middle East affairs, and powerful country in the area, plus there is the incentive to make nuclear weapons, which they seem rather willing to use.

If Iran can develop better diplomatic relations with other countries (particularly western countries) then its perhaps the best path to peace.

Also, I suppose Israel and the US should be mentioned, if they can improve relations with Islamic countries, then that would be a positive step forward.
 
 
The poll results sure are surprising..

Uuhhh. Russia and Pakistan are also nuclear armed, and Iran is working on it. Not to mention, the leaders of Russia and Iran are psycho, Russia has threatened military action in Europe if anyone dares build missile defense systems in Poland, Iran's leader has explicitly stated that he wants Israel destroyed, and Pakistan is just dying for an excuse to nuke India. Right, none of those countries fit that "threat to world peace" bill.

Iraq? The absolute loosest estimates say a million, though the real number is more than likely much lower. And only 30% of those deaths were caused by coalition forces (which include the UK, mind you).

Afghanistan? Several thousand. And again, most of those were not caused by coalition forces.

And then Vietnam. Yes, we did kill a lot of people in that one... how horrible of us, seeing as we did it in defense of another country, and we were killing the people who were killing us. AKA, not an invasion, and we didn't start it either. Also, that was 40 years ago. Times have definitely changed. And don't forget that the vast majority of Americans disagreed with it, too.

And none of these wars had to do with us enforcing our values. Bay of Pigs was an effort to allow democracy to return to Cuba, where it already had existed. Vietnam was an effort to maintain democracy that already existed in Cuba. Afghanistan was a retaliatory effort, where we attacked a terrorist network and a brutal government that supported it. We established democracy there, yes, but that was not our mission. Iraq, which I do disagree with, certainly had nothing to do with spreading our values, it was more than likely about oil.

Sorry to upset you, but American Democracy is dictatorship in disguise - but, seeing as you are American, I don't expect you to understand as you are all brainwashed by your Government.

And for the record, Vietnam was for no one's benefit, it was the USA's biased attack on communism.

You're funny. How exactly are we brainwashed by our government? Do you actually have a reason to think that's the case, or are you just spouting the things you read on internet? Or is it because some of us actually support the things the government does from time to time? Surely that's it.

But no, it is not a dictatorship in disguise. If it was, we wouldn't have those election things that go down every four years. And Vietnam was not an attack on communism, it was defense from communism. We didn't go into a communist country to try and topple it, we went into a country that was being overrun by communist forces and tried to defend it. The reason it didn't benefit anyone is because we lost.

Really. Well if everything I'm being told to you is the government's brainwashing (even though we're taught in school that Vietnam was a horrible mistake, and a crime, etc.), then please! Fill me in.

Or you can just keep on going "wow, you really are brainwashed!" Because not hating my government is totally a sign of brainwashing. Yes.

So who was the US defending.... the people of South Vietnam or the anti-communist, deeply unpopular South Vietnamese dictatorship? If you choose the former, I don't see the point of debating with you....

and your line "we were killing the people who were killing us."... have you worked it out why they were killing American soldiers? The answer is pretty obvious, and what about American soldiers killing civilians, you forgot to mention that....

The purpose is to have a place where Jews will not be persecuted for being Jews.

I'll ignore your childish remark.

The point is that Israel is not a religious state, and the video is a proof - homosexuality is against Jewish laws, but it is permitted.

 
Islamic Tyranny? No such thing exists as Islam is the best solution out there unlike the filth that is Judaism that despite its small size is the cause of all sorts of violence and extremism throughout history.
 

Islam is based of the false assumption that god exists and Muhammad was his prophet, but god does not exist and therefore Islam is false.

Because Islam will be imposed, it will be an Islamic tyranny, like in Saudi Arabia and Iran. Such a state has no right to exist.

Judaism is false as well, but like many people, you don't seem to know what being Jewish really means, and assume it has only to do with religious beliefs.

Get educated.

Iran has not launched a single attack on foreign forces, pre-emptively, in last 2 centuries.

This can't be said about USA, UK, Germany, France, other Western countries or the cesspool of misery that is the Zionist entity.

Sure, because:

1) Not all countries are trying to achieve nuclear bomb levels of uranium enrichment.

2) Not all of them have declared their intentions of wiping other countries off the map.

3) Not all of them are controlled by fanatic Muslims who promote world Islamic domination.

 
It's just like any other technology; why shouldn't Iran try to master it and why should anybody try to stop it? Least of all the countries that actually possess such know-how and even weaponized uranium?
 

Because:

1) It isn't like any other technology. It's a technology which is used to kill lost of people.

2) Putting nukes in the hands of fanatic religious leader who have expressed their intention of using it is very dangerous.

In Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, Palestine, Sudan, Vietnam, Korea and so many other places, USA and the failed Zionist entity alone were responsible for most of the unfortunate casualties.

The numbers run in the millions if not tens of millions.

 
Uuhhh. Russia and Pakistan are also nuclear armed, and Iran is working on it. Not to mention, the leaders of Russia and Iran are psycho, Russia has threatened military action in Europe if anyone dares build missile defense systems in Poland, Iran's leader has explicitly stated that he wants Israel destroyed, and Pakistan is just dying for an excuse to nuke India. Right, none of those countries fit that "threat to world peace" bill.
 

Your inability to use formal language, at least a reasonable dose of it, doesn't impress anybody. Russia and Pakistan as well as UK, France, USA, the failed Zionist entity, PRC, DPRK, India are nuclear armed. South Africa disarmed voluntarily. Given the list of civilian deaths due to Amerikans and the Zionists, there should be no doubt whatsoever, going by established facts and statistics, that these are the two major threats to world peace alongside UK.

Claiming Russian and Iranian leadership is 'psycho' only reduces your credibility. USA after all was the country that invaded Iraq illegally without any UN or other international support and did the same with Afghanistan. No international legal expert could come up with any form of support or justification for such brazen violation of sovereignity, dignity and international laws. That's why USA has to be taken to task. The failed Zionist entity relies entirely on USA for its military, economy, politics, industry, sports, science and what not. With USA down, the Zionist entity can only drown in further misery.

 
Do you have any idea how much credibility you lose by throwing that cliché "k" into the word "American?"
 

Talk about the gist of the arguments and stop bickering over trivial issues. You are the one who claimed leaders of well respected and historically powerful, intelligent nations like Iran and Russia are "psycho"

This wasn't a reply to me but pardon me for interjecting. The Zionists, and jewish fanatics aided by evangelical christian fundamentalists, are the ones who occupied and drove away the Palestinians. Unless one rectifies this wrong, there is no way one can talk about justice in that setting.

We must remember this will set a wrong precedent for the future, as anybody can come and kill all Zionists in cold blood and claim what's done is done, let bygones be bygones. Any zionist victim sympathizers in that scenario would be labelled terrorists and extremists. That is one of the pitfalls of your line of reasoning.

 
Iraq? The absolute loosest estimates say a million, though the real number is more than likely much lower. And only 30% of those deaths were caused by coalition forces (which include the UK, mind you).
 

More than a million in Iraq due to illegal invasion and war by Anglo American axis of terror since 2003. That excludes million (or half million) children killed due to Amerikan sanctions alone and other methods that put the innocents in harm's way. One must immediately 'neutralize' the Amerikan anglo zionist troika of terrorism ASAP for further peace and prosperity on earth to sustain itself.

 
Afghanistan? Several thousand. And again, most of those were not caused by coalition forces.
 

And you accuse others of pulling facts out of the backside?

 
And then Vietnam. Yes, we did kill a lot of people in that one... how horrible of us, seeing as we did it in defense of another country, and we were killing the people who were killing us. AKA, not an invasion, and we didn't start it either. Also, that was 40 years ago. Times have definitely changed. And don't forget that the vast majority of Americans disagreed with it, too.
 

Mai Lai (spelling?) alone just puts you to shame. If you didn't start it and if it was not an invasion, what were you doing killing, bombing, sendings millions to a thousands of kilometres away place?

 
And none of these wars had to do with us enforcing our values. Bay of Pigs was an effort to allow democracy to return to Cuba, where it already had existed. Vietnam was an effort to maintain democracy that already existed in Cuba. Afghanistan was a retaliatory effort, where we attacked a terrorist network and a brutal government that supported it. We established democracy there, yes, but that was not our mission. Iraq, which I do disagree with, certainly had nothing to do with spreading our values, it was more than likely about oil.
 

You are being even more facetious. Democracy is no miracle-worker nor any cherished holy ideal which should be enforced everywhere, at any cost even if it means killing people.

Afghanistan never invaded USA while USA did so. In fact, the Taliban government of Afghanistan asked USA for proofs of its claims, which USA never provided and went on to invade and bomb Afghanistan. Iraq was a blatant case proving our point that USA pose great threat to world peace, something even the most ignorant, dumbest and retarded of Amerikans have come to realize.

The Taliban have no right to exist, therefore asking for proof is irrelevant.

There's no need for an excuse to terminate their regime, all you need is motivation, which US had plenty of after 9/11.

There's really no issue here. Same goes for Iraq and any other dictatorship.

The purpose is to have a place where Jews will not be persecuted for being Jews.
 

So why are Jews living elsewhere?

 
The point is that Israel is not a religious state, and the video is a proof - homosexuality is against Jewish laws, but it is permitted.
 

I guess it's hard to resist one's natural urges. A peace loving person seeks peace, a knowledge seeking person loves to seek knowledge and a gay Zionist remains gay.

The point is that the failed entity in the cesspool of misery, the zionist entity, should not be 'established' at all if not for religious reasons.

If you argue it's to find a safe sanctuary, how did the zionists gain safety in the present location? They'd better move to Alaska or North Dakota instead.

 
Islam is based of the false assumption that god exists and Muhammad was his prophet, but god does not exist and therefore Islam is false.
 

Your statements are false.

 
Because Islam will be imposed, it will be an Islamic tyranny, like in Saudi Arabia and Iran. Such a state has no right to exist.
 

Says the resident zionist who stole, plundered, looted and expelled natives to steal land for their countries and continue to expand 'settlements' despite even UN (mostly a Western puppet institution) sanctions urging otherwise.

 
Judaism is false as well, but like many people, you don't seem to know what being Jewish really means, and assume it has only to do with religious beliefs.

Get educated.
 

If you argue Judaism is false, which it may very well be, what is the reason for Zionism and the urge to have a homeland for Jews exclusively limited to these Zionist refugees of Europe in 'the holy land'?

Go to Alaska or buy some patch of land in Alberta, Canada and peace reigns!

Sure, because:
1) Not all countries are trying to achieve nuclear bomb levels of uranium enrichment.
 

Does this include the USA, UK, and the failed zionist entity for instancce?

 
2) Not all of them have declared their intentions of wiping other countries off the map.
 

Does this include the failed Zionist entity which brandishes the 'Samson option' of wiping out neighbouring countries using nuclear bombs or the USA which has already used nuclear bombs on civilians and killed millions of innocents in the world in last few years alone or the UK which has one of the wretched and most atrocious histories of any countries of the world in its quest for empire?

 
3) Not all of them are controlled by fanatic Muslims who promote world Islamic domination.
 

Certainly, USA, UK and the failed Zionist entities are not Muslims. They are fanatic and promote domination of the world using their vile, atrocious and lowly debauchery, homosexuality, incest, paedophilia and all other forms of subhuman activities, not to mention use of bombs, nuclear weapons, chemical weapons, hypocrisy, political hardships on civilians, economic weapons, sanctions, embargoes, media propaganda, threats and deception on innocent civilians.

 
Because:

1) It isn't like any other technology. It's a technology which is used to kill lost of people.
 

It's technology that helps in generating electricity also. The last parties crying wolf should be the USA, UK or the failed Zionist entities that possess these weapons.

 
2) Putting nukes in the hands of fanatic religious leader who have expressed their intention of using it is very dangerous.
 

Thanks for agreeing that the Zionist entities nor USA nor UK deserve to possess NBC weapons, as it endangers humanity. Their fanaticism, brazen violation of -international laws, sovereignity, dignity -and lack of civility coupled with love for fornication, homosexuality, deception, incest, murder, and a host of other crimes make them ill suited for such candidature.

 
He's a Jew - don't believe anything he has to say! He only converted to Christianity to make people trust him and manipulate them into believing that Israel has nukes! He still receives his orders from the HQ of the elders of Zion, and their purpose is to create a nuclear war!  
 

Aren't you a Jew yourself?

As the possessor of nukes and being the only country to use it on civilians, not to mention how many millions it has killed elsewhere on top of the great violence it faces on home turf and having the largest prison population in whole world, the USA should be 'neutralized' if anything.

However, Iran in the last 2 centuries hasn't invaded a single country nor preemptively attacked any country unlike USA, UK, France, Germany, any other Western country or even the cesspool of filth, misery and deception that is the failed Zionist entity.

It means you have enough missile range to hit London, plus Israel has very developed tarcking and navigation technology. It's really no big deal to nuke London, you can bet on it.

Just as all the Muslim countries begged for it, and still most of them are very poor and backwards compared to Israel.

So far no Jew in Israel has ever been persecuted for being Jewish.
As far as external threats are concerned - today no place is safe from Islamic terror. You can get bombed in London, Parism, New York or Amsterdam.

 
Your statements are false.
 

How come then I am not struck by a lightning when I write:
"Muhammed was a false prophet"?

 
Says the resident zionist who stole, plundered, looted and expelled natives to steal land for their countries and continue to expand 'settlements' despite even UN (mostly a Western puppet institution) sanctions urging otherwise.
 

I Have no idea what you are on about. I never stole anything in my life.

 
If you argue Judaism is false, which it may very well be, what is the reason for Zionism and the urge to have a homeland for Jews exclusively limited to these Zionist refugees of Europe in 'the holy land'?
 

First of all you have to admit that if Judaism is false then Islam is false, simply because Muhammed recognized Mozes as a prophet.

The reason for Zionism is antisemitism. In particular the Nuremberg laws which defined Jews by their genetics rather then by their religious beliefs.

Israel is not limited to Jews. Israel's immigration laws are designed to counter the Nuremberg Laws. For example, you can be a Muslim, married to a christian, but if your spouse's grandfather is Jewish, both of you can immigrate to Israel. That's because if you lived in Germany during WWII, both of you would have been murdered regardless of you faiths.

Israel is not only for European Jews. Almost half of the Jewish population consists of Jews from Arab countries.

 
Go to Alaska or buy some patch of land in Alberta, Canada and peace reigns!
 

I live in Rehovot, a city which is build on a patch of land which was bought from the Arab village of Hirbat Duran in 1890.

AIPAC is not the biggest lobby in america. Lobbies focussed on rifles, helping the aged, small businesses and trial lawyers are all bigger. Further, lobbies in America, while more powerful than similar groups in, for example, the UK, are not the be all and end all of politics. If you look at sources of campaign funding and compare the views of constituencies with the policies supported by congressmen it is clear that lobbies are only a part of a large web of motivations for politicians.

FP is, compared to other areas of politics, largely separated from congress anyway (congress is far more susceptable to influence by lobbies than the executive).

America has its own strategic reasons for supporting israel - it feels threatened by islamism and sees israel as an ally in the middle east. It is clear that ideologically israel is the closest country in the world to america. On a practical level, since the mid 1970s Israel has been pretty much the sole source of US intelligence information regarding the arab states (this has changed recently but the CIA still work very closely with the Mossad/Shin Bet/Amman), and israel is a tactical partner for america. (source Raviv and Melman (1990))

Lobbies exist for everything from Irish Americans to supporting Cypriot national interests. What about the National Beer Wholesalers Association (this is a huge lobby, almost as big as AIPAC) - do they control america? Is that why americans drink so much beer? Obviously it is a part of the reason, but really its just because beer is a tasty and refreshing beverage...

America is no doubt influenced by AIPAC however people exaggerate this influence massively. Things like the war in iraq/afghanistan and pressure on Iran would all be happening without AIPAC.

Obviously there is no way of ultimately revealing the truth about this issue, but personally i think it is fairly obvious that AIPAC is just another large American lobby exerting some influence over some decisions.

 

after 4 years you don't seem to have a standardised response ready. lol

don't worry about it - you are entitled to your views.

And i love the idea that the zionists control all the news in the west.... thats right ALL the news.....

hence the criticism of israel in the British media and debate in the American media... yeah... that explains it.

i find your views a bit offensive really.

I think a better example of iranian agression would be its support for Shia rebels in Iraq and Hezbollah/Hamas. It is waging a proxy war against western interests in the middle east - while not directly the aggressor it is clear a belligerent nation in these conflicts.

In the filthy zionist wetdreams. There is simply no one a bigger beggar than the filthy zionist terrorists.
And yet the Zionists aren't even the richest or most advanced entity in their region.

 
Because not all of them are persecuted all the time. The ones that had it bad enough, like the Russian Jews, immigrated to Israel.
 

That contradicts your own claim. Either you are persecuted or you are not. If you claim only way to find sanctuary is have your own state, you can't live elsewhere. In fact, it's because of this fallacy of terrorist zionists, that many a Jew actually hate Zionists and voice their opinions against it.

 
Why not?
 

Why should they? By your own admission, a 'country' based on religion shouldn't even exist. That's the case with the failed zionist entity.

 
So far no Jew in Israel has ever been persecuted for being Jewish.
As far as external threats are concerned - today no place is safe from Islamic terror. You can get bombed in London, Parism, New York or Amsterdam.
 

Why don't all the Jews move to the failed Zionist entity then? As far as external threats are concerned no place is secure from anglo amerikan zionist terror. Not even North Korea, Venezuela, Tokyo, and so on. However there has never been ANY violence associated with any Zionist-funded organizations under the garb of muslim organizations in tokyo, north korea, venezuela, and so on.

That is conclusive proof in support of my claims.

 
How come then I am not struck by a lightning when I write:
"Muhammed was a false prophet"?
 

What's that supposed to mean? I could write all the filthy Jews are smelly ugly retarded cheap deceptive ki*es, and so is their false religious scripture BUT does anything happen to me? Nah!

 
I Have no idea what you are on about. I never stole anything in my life.
 

The land itself to begin with.

 
First of all you have to admit that if Judaism is false then Islam is false, simply because Muhammed recognized Mozes as a prophet.
 

Nope. I said it may very well be the case that Judaism is false, I never said anything to the contrary since its YOU who claimed that. But if you ask any Muslim scholar, nobody says Judaism is true, it was revealed for only that time when Moses arrived and that's when its utility ended. So Judaism is as good as false today (by those standards).

 
The reason for Zionism is antisemitism. In particular the Nuremberg laws which defined Jews by their genetics rather then by their religious beliefs.
 

That's only one country in Europe. If there is problem with jews in Germany, you should settle it there. Why should Palestinians have to bear the brunt of it? So go to Nuremberg if you like.

 
Israel is not limited to Jews. Israel's immigration laws are designed to counter the Nuremberg Laws. For example, you can be a Muslim, married to a christian, but if your spouse's grandfather is Jewish, both of you can immigrate to Israel. That's because if you lived in Germany during WWII, both of you would have been murdered regardless of you faiths.
 

Does that mean only Jews are allowed to migrate to the failed Zionist entity? That alone proves its limited to jews, moreover all nonjews speak of extreme racial, religious, ethnic and other forms of discrimination.

 
Israel is not only for European Jews. Almost half of the Jewish population consists of Jews from Arab countries.
 

Don't inflate the numbers. Secondly, why should the Arabian Jews have to respond to "Nuremberg" laws in germany? That's insane!

 
I live in Rehovot, a city which is build on a patch of land which was bought from the Arab village of Hirbat Duran in 1890.

You need permission to live anywhere, otherwise you or your descendants won't obtain permission when you want to live where you have invested your entire life.

Dunno.
 

One must. Otherwise one shouldn't make useless accusations or assertions.

 
Israel has never even admitted having nukes, let alone threatened to use them.
 

What do you say? Does the failed Zionist entity possess nukes and rely on the 'Samson Option"?

 
Islam is mysticism, one of the lowest forms of collectivist philosophies, so please don't lecture about sub-human activities.
 

Your false statements aside, there is only truth and moral probity that we are talkin of here. The greatest threat to civilization is being posed by the immoral, depraved, murderous axis of terror of the devillish troika of USA, UK and failed zionist entity.

 
Don't have any problems with that, but you don't need the enrichment levels that Iran is trying to achieve for that.
 

So? it's none of your business. Somebody may be purchasing cutlery, and you may ask, what is he going to do with a knife? He doesn't need a knife as sharp as that to slice meat!
Oh geez! It's his business, you are the ones possessing and threatening others with nuclear annihilation.

 
Why do you claim that they are fanatics?
 

Because of their action.

 
Yes, I am a Zionist Jew.

Do you want to kill me?
 

So you think you are untrustworthy?

Are all Zionists as dumb?

 
US has a right to exist, since it's purpose of existence is to protect it's citizen's human rights.
 

USA has killed more than any other country in last few years, and only country to ever use nukes, not to mention unconditional support for filthy Zionists. That alone should disqualify their 'right to exist'.

 
Muslim dictatorships on the other hand do not have any right to exist, because Islam is false.
 

Making two false statements don't make them true. Just because Zionism is a fake false and filthy ideology of depraved immoral lecherous treacherous barbaric idiot refugees of Europe, doesn't mean others should bear the brunt of the Europeans' misgivings.

At last you spoke the truth, the reason you aren't impressed is I am not trying to impress facts upon lost souls who don't even know basic facts are easily brainwashed by propaganda.

 
And i love the idea that the zionists control all the news in the west.... thats right ALL the news.....

i find your views a bit offensive really.
 

Hence the undue sacking of British MPs, of Catholic priests, of 'freedom of speech' to offend Muslims and Islam but not to even question the holocaust.

I mean I never witnessed the holocaust, it may have been a myth. So what if I say so? In european countries, I may be imprisoned. Isn't that Zionist control over politics and media that puts a blinder on the masses' collective eyes?

1)this is just plain wierd - i find the way you express yourself rather indicative of the quality of your argument.

2) Many countries are based on religion - Islamic countries are certainly based on religion (Saudi Arabia where it is a crime to convert out of Islam, or Syria, where Jews and other non-Muslims are subject to laws which target them specifically, to their detriment). Similarly Britain is based on its religion - while it is largely secular their are still many remenants of its religious history - the national anthem and its references to a christian god, the texts one swears on in court and parliament etc etc etc.

Having a nation based on religion clearly isn't wrong as long as you give equal rights to other religions which israel does. In fact Israeli arabs have far more rights than their cousins in most arab countries. Your insistance on spelling america with a "k" and calling israel "the zionist entity" is, once again, indicative of your rather bigotted standpoint.

3) Again, just saying something doesn't make it true. Just as you laughably oversimplified the Vanunu issue (see my post above) you have laughably oversimplified the issue of Jewish immigration. Without a nation and a government, common land does not belong to anyone. Settling on purchased land or common land (land without an owner - in the case of the mandate officially called "Crown Land") is not theft.

4) It is not the case that only jews can move to israel - sure, it is easier to move to israel if you are a jew (there is nothing wrong with this, many other nations e.g. spain, have a "right of return") but it is certainly possible for anyone. Israel has opened its doors to refugees from Africa, foreign workers from the far east and even palestinians.

5) This was completely incomprehensible but no - you only need permission to live somewhere if it has a government (some might say a legitimate government, but i think this is too subjective) capable of enforcing the law, or a private owner. Otherwise who is to give you permission?

I don't really know why i am rebutting your points, since it is quite clear from the way you write that you have very extreme and bizarre views, which i will be unable to change with logic. Conspiracy theorists have a lot in common with religious fundamentalists - they are totally convinced by their own rhetoric and base their arguments on things which by their very nature cannot be completely refuted.

whatever

Says you. In reality many Muslim countries recieve US support.
One big difference is that Israel actually exports technology as well,
while Muslim countries only use it.

 
And yet the Zionists aren't even the richest or most advanced entity in their region.
 

Of course they are.

Israel> Lebanon
Israel> Egypt
Israel> Syria
Israel> Jordan

(the list goes on...)

Considering the fact that Israel does not have any oil, it is quite amazing.

 
That contradicts your own claim. Either you are persecuted or you are not.
 

Some Jews are, and some are not.

 
If you claim only way to find sanctuary is have your own state, you can't live elsewhere.
 

This does not follow. You logic is flawed.

 
Why should they? By your own admission, a 'country' based on religion shouldn't even exist. That's the case with the failed zionist entity.
 

But that's the opposite of what you claimed. You claimed that Israel's only basis of existence is religious. Decide what your opinion on the matter is and stop contradicting yourself.

 
Why don't all the Jews move to the failed Zionist entity then?
 

Because not all of them are threatened, and some feel convenient to live where they are.

 
funded organizations under the garb of muslim organizations in tokyo, north korea, venezuela, and so on.
 

Doesn't matter under which garb. And violence against Jews has recently occurred in Venezuela.

 
What's that supposed to mean? I could write all the filthy Jews are smelly ugly retarded cheap deceptive ki*es, and so is their false religious scripture BUT does anything happen to me? Nah!
 

Which again proves my point. God does not exist.

 
The land itself to begin with.
 

As I mentioned, the land I live on was legally purchased in 1890.

 
That's only one country in Europe. If there is problem with jews in Germany, you should settle it there. Why should Palestinians have to bear the brunt of it? So go to Nuremberg if you like.
 

Palestinians are not bearing the burnt of it, they are bearing the burns of their leader's stupidity.

 
Does that mean only Jews are allowed to migrate to the failed Zionist entity? That alone proves its limited to jews
 

I explicitly said that this is not the case, you can immigrate to Israel even if you are not Jewish, as long as one of your parents/garndparents or your spouse's parents/grandparents is Jewish. This criterion is inconsistent with the Jewish definition of a Jewish person.

 
moreover all nonjews speak of extreme racial, religious, ethnic and other forms of discrimination.
 

No they don't.

 
Don't inflate the numbers. Secondly, why should the Arabian Jews have to respond to "Nuremberg" laws in germany? That's insane!
 

I'm not inflating the numbers, check it out for yourself.

The Nuremberg definitions of Jews applied to all the Jews in the world, not only to those that live in Germany. The final solution was to be applied everywhere, to every Jew in the world.

 
You need permission to live anywhere, otherwise you or your descendants won't obtain permission when you want to live where you have invested your entire life.
 

I don't need permission to live on a land that I purchased legally.

3) Hence the undue sacking of British MPs, of Catholic priests, of 'freedom of speech' to offend Muslims and Islam but not to even question the holocaust.

4 )I mean I never witnessed the holocaust, it may have been a myth. So what if I say so? In european countries, I may be imprisoned. Isn't that Zionist control over politics and media that puts a blinder on the masses' collective eyes?

 

1) You mean you won't even read a perfectly clear paragraph of proper information that you might learn from but expect me to read your garbled useless rubbish?

The message of the "convoluted" paragraph was that the official verdict by those investigating the Vanunu incident was that Israel had organised the entire thing as a piece of disinformation.

I actually disagree and do believe that israel has nuclear weapons - i was merely pointing out that you don't know even the first thing about Vanunu and have no credibility to try and prove your point by simply saying his name over and over again.

2) once again this is literally incomprehensible - please explain what you are talking about in clear English?

3) This in the wake of a foreign MP being refused entry to Britain because his views might offend Muslims? Why not cite some examples.

4) Just because denying the holocaust is a crime in many european countries doesn't necessarily imply zionist involvement does it? So no it isn't "zionist control over media and politics" any more than the fact that it is illegal to suggest everyone kill Muslims implies Islamic control over media and politics. It is a crime to deny the holocaust because it is a view that is completely discredited and very offensive. Personally i think it should probably be legal but i am frankly just amused by your assumption that any law which in some way (in your eyes) benefits zionists must have been organised by them.

One must. Otherwise one shouldn't make useless accusations or assertions.
 

I did not.

 
What do you say? Does the failed Zionist entity possess nukes and rely on the 'Samson Option"?
 

Who knows?

 
Your false statements aside, there is only truth and moral probity that we are talkin of here. The greatest threat to civilization is being posed by the immoral, depraved, murderous axis of terror of the devillish troika of USA, UK and failed zionist entity.

It is when they threaten to kill me.

 
Somebody may be purchasing cutlery, and you may ask, what is he going to do with a knife? He doesn't need a knife as sharp as that to slice meat!
Oh geez! It's his business, you are the ones possessing and threatening others with nuclear annihilation.
 

It is my business if he says: "I want to kill you".

 
Because of their action.

No, I 'm saying there's a rational way to decide these things, so no mystic entity such as "god" is needed.

 
USA has killed more than any other country in last few years, and only country to ever use nukes, not to mention unconditional support for filthy Zionists. That alone should disqualify their 'right to exist'.
 

No it shouldn't because you are dropping the context of all of the actions you specified.

 
Making two false statements don't make them true. Just because Zionism is a fake false and filthy ideology of depraved immoral lecherous treacherous barbaric idiot refugees of Europe, doesn't mean others should bear the brunt of the Europeans' misgivings.

Similarly Britain is based on its religion - while it is largely secular their are still many remenants of its religious history - the national anthem and its references to a christian god, the texts one swears on in court and parliament etc etc etc.
 

None of those countries are founded on religion, nor do they invite all people from all around the world from that same religion, nor did they occupy that land by illegally invading occupying and expelling the palestinian and their land.

1) What i mean is that i am writing in clear intelligible English. You aren't, but you still refuse to read things because you accuse them of being "convoluted".

2) Well, this really depends on each individual country doesn't it. Many islamic countries were only founded in their current form after WW1 - previously they were simply an empire based on islam. pakistan was obviously founded due to islam. Really your point is irrelevent though - it is the actions of the countries during their existence, rather than the reasons for their original establishment, which are key here. It is clear that religion often played an important part in the establishment of countries, and has played an important part in the day to day affairs of almost every country.

Of course, since zionism was largely secular it is evident that the establishment of israel was more based on national self determination as an ethnicity (as in the case of pretty much all european states in recent history) rather than religion (as in the case of most islamic states) anyway.

3) I love the idea of you accusing me of having an approach which goes against the spirit of debating, when you are so emotive (actually using offensive words etc) and often completely incomprehensible, while i am systematically dealing with everything you say in a polite (if frustrated) manner.

I think these "nitpicking" points are important because to me they demonstrate that you might well have managed to brainwash yourself lol. They simply damage your credibility, as with the Vanunu point i made, and this is actually quite important.

What does that bit about lobbies mean?

4) The British invaded the land after the ottoman empire lost a massive war (WW1) - the mandate was set up to hand the land over to the palestinian people (actually, in the words of the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem - "South Syrians"), however it quickly emerged that these "palestinians" would not accept the jews living there, and so two states seemed a better idea. So the British did not really steal the land from the palestinians in the first place.

Of course the "filthy refugees" (really - you are actually talking like this??) had the right to live there, as did anyone else. (actually, the British quickly banned jews from settling/living in a large area of the mandate (now Jordan) but not in the rest). The area had never been a nation state, did not have a government or a proper national identity, and consequently living on common land or purchasing land was perfectly justified.

You keep using the word "expelled" out of context. The only convincing evidence of "expulsion" comes during the '48 war which the arabs started, and the word is largely inapplicable anyway - war leads to population movements. were the french citizens who were forced to flee when the Allies recoccupied Normandy "expelled"?

5) LOL - yes "refugees from africa to the zionist entity" indeed.

 http://www.cnsnews.com/Public/Conten...x?RsrcID=36007 

The conditions you have set here are rather stringent... they have to have been successful in their field? This is irrelevent to your original claim that israel only allows jews to move there, which is clearly rubbish.

6) once again you have over simplified the matter totally. The situation would not be comparable since Britain would have previously had a national identity and government, and the UN would presumably not have sanctioned the occupation. It would also depend on who had started the war in the first place.

If Britain enforced no law for any reason i would not blame people fleeing oppression for coming here provided they settled on common land or purchased land.
 
 
maths-enthusiast - you take a really dubious viewpoint, standing alongside dictators and opressive regimes in order that you can criticise israel and America....

tell me, do you believe in free speech? womens' rights? gay rights? democracy? free press? equality of opportunity (e.g. socialism/mixed economy like britain)? freedom of religion? etc etc

if you do, how can you stand against a place like israel, in favour of a place like syria or iran or an organisation like hamas or the PLO?

I don't support Israel despite my belief in civil rights - i support israel because of my belief in civil rights.

This shows the extreme stupidity in the Zionist establishment's line of thinking. I think this may be the last time I respond to a jew who thinks his own claim is all there needs to be in the form of evidence.

 
Says you. In reality many Muslim countries recieve US support.
One big difference is that Israel actually exports technology as well,
while Muslim countries only use it.
 

Haha that's as big a lie as Zionists being kind hearted, natural owners of palestinian lands. There is nothign the failed Zionist entity exports or makes without the Amerikan active aid and support no matter in what field you talk about - military, economic, political, entertainment, sports, industry, science or technology.

There are many Muslim countries that are in fact richer than and faster growing than any Western country today. There are many Muslim countries that have actually a history of civilization stretching back millennia to include the earliest civilizations that ever existed unlike Western countries, dont' even bother with refugees from Europe.

In fact, only recently Iran (under Western embargo, sanctions, propaganda, threats, scrutiny, and political pressure) sent its indigenous satellite on its own rocket launcher to space unlike some that survives on scavenging for aid. Iran has the largest auto manufacturing industry in that region despite such western actions as mentioned, has some of the best students and brains in the world as evidenced by International Maths and other olympiad and contests performances, which neither the Amerikans, Zionists nor Brits can lay claim to (only Chinese, Korean and Russians generally perform better), has a history of actually liberating Jews and the largest legal community of Jews in that region with a history spanning millennia.

This is not to include that Iran is progressive in nanotechnology, cloning and what not. And it's just one country we are talking about.

 
Of course they are.

Israel> Lebanon
Israel> Egypt
Israel> Syria
Israel> Jordan

(the list goes on...)
 

Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Egypt? Egypt's GDP is larger than Zionists,   Syria is under Amerikan sanctions and threats. Egypt and Jordan are under secular dictators aligned with Amerikans how do you expect them to prosper, if you deduct Amerikan aid of all forms to Zionists, in fact Ethiopia is a better performer than the Zionists.

Let's not mention the likes of Dubai, Abu Dhabi and other Emirates, or Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and so on which are multiple times higher in standards of living compared to the Zionist entity. Let's not even compare the failed Zionist entity in GDP to Iran, Turkey, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Malaysia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nigeria. I mean some of these countries are very poor, still they beat the failed Zionist entity with complete and utter ease in GDP despite so much aid.

 
Considering the fact that Israel does not have any oil, it is quite amazing.
 

That it receives so much Amerikan aid of all sorts is amazing indeed.

 
Some Jews are, and some are not.
 

That's true for everyone, nobody else goes around trying to steal others' lands, and creating a state for themselves for this.

 
This does not follow. You logic is flawed.
 

It is very logical. You can't have your cake and eat it too.

 
But that's the opposite of what you claimed. You claimed that Israel's only basis of existence is religious. Decide what your opinion on the matter is and stop contradicting yourself.
 

See how facetious you are being. You are the one who claimed a country should be established, if deemed necessary, for religious reasons. Now you tell me I contradict myself? The failed Zionist entity has no basis for existence and it's only public reason for its illegal 'creation' was a religious call. A call to unite the world's jews into one country and it has failed as Jews see what a fanatic, misguided, terroristic development Zionism is.

 
Because not all of them are threatened, and some feel convenient to live where they are.
 

So? One can't jeopardize civilization and innocent residents of some place due to the whims of some fanatic terrorist refugees of Europe. You at least have to make a united concerted effort to present a logical case, which you h ave failed to do owing to the very misguided and reprehensible ways upon which your movement was founded.

 
Doesn't matter under which garb. And violence against Jews has recently occurred in Venezuela.
 

At least make up your mind before you spout drivel. Is there any violence related issues with Muslims in Venezuela, North korea, Brazil, South Africa, Tokyo, and so on? Whereas all those countries have or will experience(d) the anglo amerikan axis of terrorism's murderous onslaught at one point or another.

 
Which again proves my point. God does not exist.
 

Or maybe Judaism is false? Well maybe.

 
As I mentioned, the land I live on was legally purchased in 1890.
 

The Zionist entity did so, what is the issue with the growing settlements in West Bank and so on?

 
Palestinians are not bearing the burnt of it, they are bearing the burns of their leader's stupidity.
 

Are the Zionists now supposed to be the leaders of Palestinians? Get back to reality and stop daydreaming.

 
I explicitly said that this is not the case, you can immigrate to Israel even if you are not Jewish, as long as one of your parents/garndparents or your spouse's parents/grandparents is Jewish. This criterion is inconsistent with the Jewish definition of a Jewish person.
 

No, EVEN YOU are saying one must have Jewish ancestors to immigrate to the failed Zionist state proving my claims right.

 
No they don't.
 

That's it, my last argument with you as you are blatantly lying. Simple, lies! End of story.

 
I'm not inflating the numbers, check it out for yourself.

The Nuremberg definitions of Jews applied to all the Jews in the world, not only to those that live in Germany. The final solution was to be applied everywhere, to every Jew in the world.

I don't need permission to live on a land that I purchased legally.
 

I don't need to exchange 'pleasantries' with blatant liars.

article 1 reflects an unfortunate reality - bureaucratic issues in israel lead to problems. The article is not really convincing though on the subject of the actual racial element (and the source isn't exactly huge lol) - the idea of "usurping" the land by getting the people who live on it to move into the cities seems a bit strange. The people are israeli citizens and the land is israeli land - one wonders what the land (desert) is so needed for?

There is no doubt racial descrimination in israel, but it is rarely if ever state sanctioned - the fact that the man was given treatment sort of reflects this. There are also jewish towns not hooked up to electricity - the issue is one of proceedure not race.

I still don't see your point - the kind of descrimination that takes place across the arab world would make these allegations, even if they were true, look tame.

article 2 - this is about a joke made by a guy.... it was actually a pretty funny remark, and was a self deprecating one (the joke is obviously against the jews and their stereotypical pushyness). I found it quite amusing. I am curious what you want us to take away from this article?

(unless you simply found it amusing too?)

if it is about the "welcome home" remark - well.... seriously?

1) it is a remark made by one man
2) there are a whole host of reasons why it is not offensive or impolite

i am curious as to what you want people to take away from these....

i am still curious why you side with all these regimes that oppress everyone and are so ghastly and hate countries where things are well, just great lol

lol - this just doesn't make sense.

Israel is indisputably a success story in terms of its economy and growth etc. It has gone from nothing to having the highest rate of start up companies, a booming economy, the highest number of degrees and Phds per head, a wonderfully designed supreme court, a flourishing democracy, equal rights etc etc the list goes on and i will go on if you want me too lol.

the idea that it depends on aid in every area is also laughable.

For much of its life it has recieved no aid whatsoever - military aid began in earnest in the 1980s, just as growth was begining to slow.... its best period was when it was independent.

As a fraction of GDP the aid is not so important - much of it is military, arguably putting israel on an even footing rather than beneffitting it directly (in that no other country is forced by its neighbours' bigotry to invest so heavily in defence) etc etc etc

you really know nothing about this do you?

i still do not understand why it is failed... the only thing i can see is success in every field.

Is this directed against me or borismor?

either way - obviously minorities do face discrimination in israel, as they do in britain or australia or italy or germany etc....

however they do not face discrimination like they do in syria for example lol

anyway - calling us liars and refusing to "engage in conversation" with us based on our political beliefs.... are you sure you are not running away from us because you are totally losing this argument?

I mean, what is the message behind that convoluted paragraph.

 
The message of the "convoluted" paragraph was that the official verdict by those investigating the Vanunu incident was that Israel had organised the entire thing as a piece of disinformation.
 

Exactly why I called it convoluted. How does it make sense for the Zionists to spread such disinformation in such a manner?

 
I actually disagree and do believe that israel has nuclear weapons - i was merely pointing out that you don't know even the first thing about Vanunu and have no credibility to try and prove your point by simply saying his name over and over again.
 

I too agree that the Zionists have nuclear weapons thanks to western complicity.I was just pointing out that the biggest and most obvious proof could be from some whistleblower, rather than some disinterested party or some opinionated article.

 
2) once again this is literally incomprehensible - please explain what you are talking about in clear English?
 

Sorry for the typo. This is the amended version.

2) At last you spoke the truth, the reason you aren't impressed is I am not trying to impress facts upon lost souls who don't even know basic facts and are easily brainwashed by propaganda

 
3) This in the wake of a foreign MP being refused entry to Britain because his views might offend Muslims? Why not cite some examples.
 

Foreign MP? Who cares about them? We are talking of British diplomats (sorry, not an MP) being ARRESTED for some foreigners who have no benefits to offer the British?

4) Just because denying the holocaust is a crime in many european countries doesn't necessarily imply zionist involvement does it? So no it isn't "zionist control over media and politics" any more than the fact that it is illegal to suggest everyone kill Muslims implies Islamic control over media and politics. It is a crime to deny the holocaust because it is a view that is completely discredited and very offensive. Personally i think it should probably be legal but i am frankly just amused by your assumption that any law which in some way (in your eyes) benefits zionists must have been organised by them.
 

It is illegal to suggest killling of anyone, be they idiot dutch MPs, fanatic Zionists or innocent civilians- Christians Muslims or Buddhists in most Western countries. But why is it illegal to question the holocaust? It's stunting free speech which the West so highly cherishes and brandishes, to even insult Islam and Muslims but when it comes to even investigating a historical fact, they are found wanting.

This of course opens up a can of worms.
 
 
I am still waiting for farhan (or anybody else) to read/reply too my comment about AIPAC lol

Whose attacks against whom are you talking of?
Why didn't no such shia-sunni conflict happen in Iraq before and why isn't it happening in other neighbouring countries? Obviously it's do with anglo amerikan zionist troika of terrorists' devious schemes to 'divide and conquer' the noble and proud iraqis into warring sects.

In fact, your suggestions make less sense considering the Shia are the majority in Iraq and a democracy automatically would favour the majority.

1) Isn't it obvious? In order to intimidate the arab nations without officially revealing a nuclear arsenal (they might want to do this even if they did not have one)... as the judge said "disinformation".

2) yes we agree. However the best proof comes not from a whistleblower who may not be reliable (for whatever reason (Vanunu might not be reliable for several reasons for example)). The best proof comes from good analysis of history. (surely a "disinterested" analysis would actually be good?)

My point on this matter was that since you do not know anything about the Vanunu incident you are not in a position to believe you have any proof. I am in a much better position to say i have proof, since i actually know a bit about the incident.... you on the other hand, as I said earlier, have no credibility to claim israel has nuclear weapons simply by repeating Vanunu's name over and over again.

3) it wasn't the typo that confused me... the whole sentence is just incomprehensible. Who are the "lost souls" and what facts are you trying to "impress upon them". Why would it not impress me? i am so confused by this: try writing it again in different words.

are you suggesting that i am aiming to bias people with propaganda? i really don't know.

4) you have missed the point here completely lol. I actually agree that it probably should be allowed to question the holocaust, even though it is a retarded view to hold.

However, just because it isn't does not mean that the zionists control our politics and media... my point was that lots of restrictions are placed on free speech, from shouting "fire" in a crowded theatre to inciting racial hatred (for example saying Muslims are evil) to denying the holocaust... right or wrong it impliesnothing about zionists (this constituted your evidence that zionists control everything lol).

As for the single example you have given about "politicians" being arrested: yeah, so he was arrested for public disorder and shouting anti-semitic and offensive remarks ("f-ing jews" etc etc)... so what? why does this mean zionists control everything.... it simply doesn't. If he had been absusing muslims would you support his arrest?

He was not "arrested for some foreigners who have nothing to offer the British" - he was arrested because he did things that contravened British law and British values (ranging from shouting abuse in a threatening way in public to picking on a particular religion), just as the Dutch MP was banned from Britain becuase he contravenes British values (just becuase he is foreign does not mean he is irrelevent "who cares about them" lol... you come out with some silly stuff)

You're aware that Egypt's population is many times larger than Israel's, and a comparison per capita reveals that Israel is far richer proportionally than Egypt.

 
if you deduct Amerikan aid of all forms to Zionists, in fact Ethiopia is a better performer than the Zionists.
 

Define aid, as you see it.

 
Let's not even compare the failed Zionist entity in GDP to Iran, Turkey, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Malaysia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nigeria. I mean some of these countries are very poor, still they beat the failed Zionist entity with complete and utter ease in GDP despite so much aid.
 

Why on earth are you comparing GDP's in absolute terms? What does that even acheive?

 http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/23/in...3cnd-iraq.html 

It didn't happen before becuase iraq had a stable, if obnoxious, government - saddam. Shias were largely opressed and iran kept its distance after hostilities between the two nations.

It isn't happening in neighbouring countries for a combination of reasons (largely that they have stable governments with law and order, and not so evenly split groups).

It is happening in Iraq because law and order has broken down, and dissident elements want to keep it that way, at the same time grabbing power for themselves.

Iran obviously knows a democracy would favour Shias, but also realises that this would still be an Iraqi democracy - enabling this to happen would allow america to have achieved success, and would give some powers to sunnis, which they do not want. It would also prevent them from having the kind of power they want over iraq

this is all theory of course: what is not theory is that tha majority of attacks are sectarian, often lead by iranian backed militias, rather than against allied forces.

i love the idea of a troika of terrorism - if you really believe the amricans predicted the turmoil in iraq and actually wanted it to happen you are crazy - it has made iraq into a very expensive disaster... they have not gained anything from it that i can see (perhaps you can explain) while all their logical objectives have failed (setting up a stable pro-american outpost in the middle east, creating a place to buy oil from in a stable way etc etc )

you have such wacko views.

I do read those who I reply to, otherwise you should've known by now and you wouldn't be replying even assuming you are the only sane and logical person in this debate.

 
2) Well, this really depends on each individual country doesn't it. Many islamic countries were only founded in their current form after WW1 - previously they were simply an empire based on islam. pakistan was obviously founded due to islam. Really your point is irrelevent though - it is the actions of the countries during their existence, rather than the reasons for their original establishment, which are key here. It is clear that religion often played an important part in the establishment of countries, and has played an important part in the day to day affairs of almost every country.
 

I don't see the reason for your undue affection for Islamic countries and in any case many Muslims in fact are urging for a return to Caliphate. Also you are being naive in saying previously all Muslim countries were empires based on Islam, as it's not true for almost most Muslim countries. Even Pakistan of today's boundaries wasn't founded 'on Islam'.

You're obviously trying to legitimize an illegal and illogical case for the Zionists' sake. What matters most is the actual reason for something's existence followed by how it carried itself in the ensuing years.

 
Of course, since zionism was largely secular it is evident that the establishment of israel was more based on national self determination as an ethnicity (as in the case of pretty much all european states in recent history) rather than religion (as in the case of most islamic states) anyway.
 

Although your information is wrong, if it were right why would the Zionists then want a state solely for Judaism (using star of david in its flag, in the 'holy land') instead of an ethnicity based state somewhere in Germany or Europe?

Your claim that most Islamic states were founded on religion is wrong, because if they were founded on religion they wouldn't be having so many states but one Caliphate. You need to double-check your facts

 
3) I love the idea of you accusing me of having an approach which goes against the spirit of debating, when you are so emotive (actually using offensive words etc) and often completely incomprehensible, while i am systematically dealing with everything you say in a polite (if frustrated) manner.

I think these "nitpicking" points are important because to me they demonstrate that you might well have managed to brainwash yourself lol. They simply damage your credibility, as with the Vanunu point i made, and this is actually quite important.

What does that bit about lobbies mean?
 

Well surely I am not the one saying innocent civilians should be killed or that Western countries should be bombed to smithereens because Western countries have no right to exist. Nor that Jews have no right to exist. It's your comrade who actually does so.

 
4) The British invaded the land after the ottoman empire lost a massive war (WW1) - the mandate was set up to hand the land over to the palestinian people (actually, in the words of the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem - "South Syrians"), however it quickly emerged that these "palestinians" would not accept the jews living there, and so two states seemed a better idea. So the British did not really steal the land from the palestinians in the first place.
 

It does seem your logic may have betrayed you. If the land belongs to Palestinians who are the British to hand it over to anyone else?

 
Of course the "filthy refugees" (really - you are actually talking like this??) had the right to live there, as did anyone else. (actually, the British quickly banned jews from settling/living in a large area of the mandate (now Jordan) but not in the rest). The area had never been a nation state, did not have a government or a proper national identity, and consequently living on common land or purchasing land was perfectly justified.
 

No, using that logic, the whole world could/would have poured into Palestine,antarctica, london or anywhere else. If the area in fact never had been a nation state, why do Jews claim they are returning to their homeland by moving to Palestine? Surely something is amiss here.

 
You keep using the word "expelled" out of context. The only convincing evidence of "expulsion" comes during the '48 war which the arabs started, and the word is largely inapplicable anyway - war leads to population movements. were the french citizens who were forced to flee when the Allies recoccupied Normandy "expelled"?
 

What are you rambling about? Who is talking about '48 war or Normandy here?

 
5) LOL - yes "refugees from africa to the zionist entity" indeed.

 http://www.cnsnews.com/Public/Conten...x?RsrcID=36007 

The conditions you have set here are rather stringent... they have to have been successful in their field? This is irrelevent to your original claim that israel only allows jews to move there, which is clearly rubbish.
 

Why is it stringent? In fact even in that link, it says the Christian Sudanese want to go back to Sudan countering the article's false claims they are being persecuted. Why else would you want to go back? Why not settle down and spread your roots in the Zionist entity if it was a bed of roses for them?

That's notwithstanding the pro-zionist slant of that source.

 
6) once again you have over simplified the matter totally. The situation would not be comparable since Britain would have previously had a national identity and government, and the UN would presumably not have sanctioned the occupation. It would also depend on who had started the war in the first place.

If Britain enforced no law for any reason i would not blame people fleeing oppression for coming here provided they settled on common land or purchased land.
 

That's quite a tricky deal you set up to mirror that of the Zionist situation as you described in your own words.
With so many nationalities and ethnic groups, one can't say Britain has a set national identity. One could also argue British government is a lickspittle of the Amerikan one. In that case, would it be justified to invade UK, and some third party convince the invader to occupy piccadilly circus and leicester?
