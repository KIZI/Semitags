The Romanian government fell Tuesday after losing a no-confidence motion despite
Prime Minister Emil Boc's pleas that the collapse of his administration could
put an IMF-led economic bailout at risk.

A total of 258 lawmakers approved the motion against 176 who voted for the
government.

The opposition had accused Boc of setting up an "illegitimate" interim
government, consisting solely of members of his Liberal Democratic Party (PDL),
after the Social-Democrats quit the ruling coalition on October 1 in protest at
the sacking of one of their ministers.
