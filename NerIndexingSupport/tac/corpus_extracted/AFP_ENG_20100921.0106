The number of Alzheimer's sufferers worldwide will double within 20 years to
more than 65 million, according to a study published Tuesday to mark World
Alzheimer's Day.

The cost of the disease and other forms of dementia will cost one percent of
global gross domestic product this year and the problem is set to grow massively
in the next two decades as people live longer.

The World Alzheimer Report 2010 said governments were "woefully unprepared" for
the scale of the disruption that dementia will cause.

Alzheimer's Disease International (ADI), the umbrella body of national
associations for the disease, estimates the number of Alzheimer's sufferers will
mushroom from 35.6 million people worldwide now to 65.7 million by 2030 and
115.4 million by 2050.

"This is a wake-up call that Alzheimer's disease and other dementias are the
single most significant health and social crisis of the 21st century," said ADI
chairwoman Daisy Acosta.

"World governments are woefully unprepared for the social and economic
disruptions this disease will cause."

The report was jointly written by Professor Anders Wimo of the Karolinska
Institutet in Stockholm and Professor Martin Prince of King's College London.
