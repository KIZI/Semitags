 
 
FINAL COUNTDOWN FOR USA ELECTION 2008
 
 
Okay, the conventions are over and both candidates are in the final stretch to convince the American people who should be their next President and which party should control the Congress.

According to the current polls, the two candidates are statistically tied.

Post excerpts and links to interesting commentary, appropriate cartoons, and take your best shots to defend your candidate.

May the best man win.
 
 
@Foxfyre,

 
May the best man win.

 

I vote for that. Go McCain. And Palin, she is a man too. Some of the best men are women.
 
 
 

 
 
 
@Foxfyre,

I'm sorry to have to point out to you, but according to the current polls, Obama is in the lead - not statistically tied.

 

Obama is in the lead by an average of almost 5 points in the national polling.

On the state polling level, he's far ahead - at this point, if he wins every state that he's currently leading by more then 3, and McCain wins every state that HE'S leading by more then 3, then Obama only has to win one state out of CO, FL, OH, or VA in order to win the election. Not too shabby.

@Cycloptichorn,

Your little Pollster buddies are very slow in spotting trends... give them 3 or 4 days to catch up and post your squiggly lines with dots again.
 
 
Could be Cyclop. but we only have two days post-Palin speech and one day post-McCain speech. Probably need a few days for it all to shake out. The RCP average has Obama up 3.8 today. Rasmussen has him up by 1.0 this morning.

I don't doubt that he does have an edge though.
 
 
@Cycloptichorn,

Cyclo, As a matter of fact, those contested states that went republican during the last election are now leaning Obama. I still don't have confidence in the American People that they understand all of the lies and innuendos passed on by the republican convention, but the delegates ate them up without questioning their veracity - and members of the party parroted the same lies when they were interviewed by the media. Makes one wonder about the American electorate.
 
 
I'll post this links periodically as the discussions will (hopefully) focus on the actual issues in the next weeks. This site has a pretty good collection of all the candidate quotes, positions, and votes and I notice they just added Sarah Palin too.

@Foxfyre,

Ras has him up 2, 48-46. Gotta go with the 'counting leaners' numbers, as that's the one everyone always uses when figuring out charts.

I think that McCain will get a small bounce out of the convention, but not enough to catch Obama. I agree that we will have to wait till next week to see where the numbers are at. But it's not accurate to say that they are tied, for according to the data, they are not. Obama is FAR ahead in state polling, and McCain's bounce probably won't touch that too much.

@Cycloptichorn,

A president's pension is currently $191,300 per year, until he is 80 years old.

Assuming the next president lives to age 80.
Sen. McCain would receive ZERO pension as he would reach 80 at the end of two terms as president.
Sen. Obama would be retired for 26 years after two terms and would receive $4,973,800 in pension.

It would certainly benefit the taxpayers to elect McCain in November.

Anything within the margin of error is statistically tied. And I did use the term statistically tied, not tied.

Actually that's a good place to be in the final countdown as the winner is now far more likely to be chosen on the issues than on celebrity status.
 
 
@Foxfyre,

Hmm, well, in many of the recent polls, Obama is winning outside of the margin of error; and there is no margin of error in a composite poll of polls.

In the state polling, he's certainly far ahead, I think we can both agree on that. Right?

I don't know. How much state polling data do you have since both conventions closed?
 
 
@Foxfyre,

Sigh. Not much. But does that matter? At this time, Obama is far ahead in the state polls. If new ones come out, that could change.

But I doubt it. If you go to pollster.com, you will see that they break down the 'lead' states into two categories: strong leads and 'leans.' Obama's number of states with 'strong' leads is far, far higher then McCain - 231 electoral votes to 115 electoral votes. Those states are not going to change b/c of the convention, on either side.

As for the 'leans,' its' the opposite: 29 O to 64 McC. These could change but it would have to be a big change in order to make them flip to McCain.

At this point it's entirely fair to say, even before we see the post-convention polling, that McCain is still WAY BEHIND in electoral votes. He literally has to win every state he's leading in right now, plus EVERY CONTESTED STATE in order to win the election. That's a tough row to hoe.

Cycloptichorn
 
 
@Cycloptichorn,

The latest RCP battleground states has Obama up by an average of 3.8 but doesn't indicate whether that is within the margin of error. We'll look at it again in a few days and see if there has been any movement.

 http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/battleground.html 

I don't know how Pollster.com gathers its information. They do ask for an awful lot of anonymous on line voting but no clue whether that is what is reflected in their statistics. The AOL straw poll had McCain ahead of Obama by more than 2 to 1 this morning, and I don't believe that is the true picture for a minute.

Where do you see that? Where they use averages I mean. I couldn't find anything about that on the website; just a page that might explain it that is apparently under construction. I don't know for sure but assumed they do straw polling only which could be why I don't see their polls included in RCP averages or with other examples of polling data or cited in the media. I could be wrong of course and I have never looked into it.
 
 
@Cycloptichorn,

Cyclo, I know my info is a few days old, but that's the same info I have; that Obama is way ahead in electoral votes, and the toss-up states are leaning Obama that previously voted republican.

That's the only reason why the republicans keep pushing the popular vote numbers, because that's the only way they can say McCain is "even" with Obama.

ROFL
 
 
Best cartoon of the day:
 
 
 
@Foxfyre,

The democrats realize that they can not compete with McCain & Palin
so they and the elite liberal media are out to destroy McCain & Palin.

The worst the left can muster is on the way...
 
 
@Foxfyre,

They do NOT use straw polling at all, let alone only. They use averages combined with a regression analysis.

Like I said: click on the state. Look at the chart. Look below the chart. There you will find the polls that are used for each state. Many of those polls are the exact same ones that RCP uses.

Here's the link to the FAQ -

 http://www.pollster.com/faq/map_faq.php 

Here's the explanation:

 
How do regression trend lines differ from simple averages?

Charles Franklin, who created the statistical routines that plot our trend lines, provided the following explanation last year:

Our trend estimate is just that, an estimate of the trends and where the race stands as of the latest data available. It is NOT a simple average of recent polling but a "local regression" estimate of support as of the most recent poll. So if you are trying to [calculate] our trend estimates from just averaging the recent polls, you won't succeed.

Here is a way to think about this: suppose the last 5 polls in a race are 25, 27, 29, 31 and 33. Which is a better estimate of where the race stands today? 29 (the mean) or 33 (the local trend)? Since support has risen by 2 points in each successive poll, our estimator will say the trend is currently 33%, not the 29% the polls averaged over the past 2 or 3 weeks during which the last 5 polls were taken. Of course real data are more noisy than my example, so we have to fit the trend in a more complicated way than the example, but the logic is the same. Our trend estimates are local regression predictions, not simple averaging. If the data have been flat for a while, the trend and the mean will be quite close to each other. But if the polls are moving consistently either up or down, the trend estimate will be a better estimate of opinion as of today while the simple average will be an estimate of where the race was some 3 polls ago (for a 5 poll average-- longer ago as more polls are included in the average.) And that's why we estimate the trends the way we do.

 

Face it - Obama is way ahead in the state polling. Even on the RCP site he's way ahead.

Cycloptichorn
 
 
@H2O MAN,

Yes they were, H2O, but I'm hoping they are now seeing that as counter productive and will back off on that. The American people should resist allowing the Fifth Estate to be who picks our leaders. John McCain offered us all an opportunity to set aside petty partisan rancor and actually look at the track record, qualifications, vision, and agenda of the candidates.

How refreshing it would be to actually do that.
 
 
 
Face it - Obama is way ahead in the state polling. Even on the RCP site he's way ahead.

Cycloptichorn
 

I'll face it when we see some current data. Okay?
 
 
@Foxfyre,

One would think that a guy who was really interested in setting aside 'partisan rancor' wouldn't have run over 15 different attack ads on Obama, many of which compared him to Brittney Spears and Hilton, over the last 2 months. Or that his VP pick wouldn't have been condescending and rude in her speech.

Anyways - Gallup:

 

Race tightens some. Obama still up by 4. Even considering Palin reax, he's not down - better then I'd hoped.

Cycloptichorn
 
 
@Cycloptichorn,

How long did we have to wait for Obama's bounce to show up in the polls Cyclo?

Was it 3 or 4 days?

Wait until Tuesday and shows us your pretty pictures.
 
 
@Cycloptichorn,

In his convention speech, McCain, the self-appointed agent of change, set forth a goal of REVERTING to the past. He said, "The party of Lincoln, Roosevelt and Reagan is going to get back to basics." McCain then recited the basics of Reaganomics. It's the old trickle-down economic plan that involves the wealthiest families and corporate America splashing around in a big pool of wealth with the hope that maybe a drop or two from their splashing prosperity will fall upon the working people. But, if people recall, Reagan's trickle-down economic plan was an utter failure and he had to RAISE taxes--more than once!

How can McCain make trickle-down economics work when it has never worked in the past? After all, the premise is fatally flawed. The rich get richer and the poor get poorer and the country sinks further into recession. An occasional tax rebate that makes it possible for working people to spend a couple hundred dollars at Wal Mart isn't going to create jobs or keep people from losing their homes.
 
 
@Debra Law,

Naturally, I agree. Conservatives seem to forget that Reagan raised taxes 7-8 times, including some very large raises.

Cycloptichorn
 
 
@Debra Law,

 
The rich get richer and the poor get poorer and the country sinks further into recession.

 

Hey!, that's Obama's plan!
 
 
@H2O MAN,

Obama got a 5 point bounce on Tuesday DURING the Democratic convention and was leading by 8 when the convention ended with Obama's speech.

Do you need help reading a calender and comparing it to the Gallup chart?

Do you favor Obama's suggestion to limit drilling offshore and elsewhere but send everybody $1000 to offset high energy costs? If not, why? If so, why?

From the Drudge Report

 
BIG DILEMMA: OPRAH BALKS AT HOSTING SARAH PALIN; STAFF DIVIDED
Fri Sep 05 2008 08:55:46 ET

Oprah Winfrey may have introduced Democrat Barack Obama to the women of America -- but the talkshow queen is not rushing to embrace the first woman on a Republican presidential ticket!

Oprah's staff is sharply divided on the merits of booking Sarah Palin, sources tell the DRUDGE REPORT.

"Half of her staff really wants Sarah Palin on," an insider explains. "Oprah's website is getting tons of requests to put her on, but Oprah and a couple of her top people are adamantly against it because of Obama."

One executive close to Winfrey is warning any Palin ban could ignite a dramatic backlash!

It is not clear if Oprah has softened her position after watching Palin's historic convention speech.

Last year, Winfrey blocked an appearance by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, timed to a promotional tour of his autobiography.

Oprah and executive producer Sheri Salata, who has contributed thousands of dollars to Obama's campaign, refused requests for comment.

Developing...
 

With this addendum added later:

 
OPRAH'S STATEMENT: "The item in today's Drudge Report is categorically untrue. There has been absolutely no discussion about having Sarah Palin on my show. At the beginning of this Presidential campaign when I decided that I was going to take my first public stance in support of a candidate, I made the decision not to use my show as a platform for any of the candidates. I agree that Sarah Palin would be a fantastic interview, and I would love to have her on after the campaign is over."

So whats your take, Fox?

 

On what, Oprah? I think she is terrified that giving Palin any face time will hurt Obama and she really REALLY doesn't want to do that. And I think she realizes that will be a huge double standard and offensive to a sizable chunk of her audience. I also suspect she is lying through her teeth. So what is your take?
 
 
@FreeDuck,

I'm not Foxfyre, but I think Oprah should invite her and ask her honest questions. I doubt Ms. Palin would accept, but she should be offered the time. I understand why Oprah would not want Clarence Thomas, I wouldn't want him near me either, but this is different.
 
 
 
Do you need help reading a calender and comparing it to the Gallup chart?

 

It is you that requires assistance...
A convention bounce, as was the case with the Democrats, typically takes a few days to build,
so the numbers coming out over the weekend may be a more realistic gauge of public opinion.

Dunno. I sure think her assertion that she would "love to have Palin on" holds no water whatsoever. Very magnanimous of her to maintain 'neutrality' on her show AFTER she has given her chosen candidate some significant face time though, don't you think?

Greenwitch, whom I know to be an Obama supporter, is taking a much more realistic view than Oprah is.
 
 
Will there be an October Surprise for Election 2008?

 
Subpoenas to be issued for Troopergate probe
(By STEVE QUINN, Associated Press, September 5, 2005)

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) " The Alaska Legislature will work to complete its ethics investigation into Gov. Sarah Palin's firing of her public safety commissioner earlier than expected, weeks before the national election.

State Sen. Hollis French says seven witnesses told the Legislature's investigator they will not provide depositions and canceled their meetings. French, who is overseeing the investigation into whether Palin abused her power, said the Legislature will subpoena witnesses.

Lawmakers say they have put the investigation on a fast track now that Palin is Republican John McCain's running mate. The investigation previously was expected to end on Oct. 31. French says the probe will be completed three weeks earlier than that.

In July, a state oversight committee approved $100,000 for an investigation into whether Palin fired public safety commissioner Walt Monegan because he would not dismiss a trooper who went through a messy divorce with her sister before Palin ran for governor.
 
 
 
@wandeljw,

Don't see how there can be an "October surprise" when the anti-Palin media blitz is dragging through the mud every thing negative they can find or make up about her all the way back to gradeschool.

Megan Kelly on Fox absolutely nailed the US Magazine editor this week though. He was lying through his teeth multiple times and she had done her homework so that she exposed him in every one of them.

McCain said he's going to cut waste, but with his push for Bush's tax cuts to become permanent, what makes him think our country will be better off? Bush's tax cuts (for the wealthy) has not produced the jobs he promised, and the middle class and poor are losing their jobs and homes as we speak. The unemployment rate is now over 6 percent, and McCain wants more of the same.

How can voters wish or want more of the same? Are they all masochists?
 
 
@cicerone imposter,

You might have a case CI if you can track any lost jobs or defaulted mortgages to those tax cuts. I'm pretty darn sure that you can't do that, but give it your best shot.

I can see how, having already endorsed a candidate, she might think it better not to use her show to interview any candidates. Can you see how those interviews would be picked apart for bias? Oprah is not stupid -- I am sure she knows how some people would take it if she doesnt have Palin on. But if she says she promised not to have any candidates on, and she hasnt up till now, then she is just being consistent.

I think its all moot anyway. Palin doesnt seem interested in giving interviews.

Good luck on the weekend polling numbers..

The Democratic bounce occurred on the Wed and Thurs of their convention. There was little change on the weekend following the convention even with McCain announcing his VP on Friday.

You just posted a story about the GOP bounce from the Thurs polling after you have been telling us the polls won't show it until the weekend. Do you always undercut your own argument and ignore facts?

Wait.. don't answer that question.. We want to be surprised by your actions.

Do you know who wrote that US Magazine piece? It was a McCain supporter.

That is their job. We dont know who she is and we only have about 2 more months to find out. Im sure it isnt pleasant for Palin, but tough shit, frankly. She isnt a wilting flower.

Federal Budget Grows Massively Under Bush

Monday, January 12, 2004

By Peter Brownfeld
WASHINGTON " Conservative observers and budget watchdogs are hoping that President Bush breaks a three-year trend of massive spending increases when he sends Congress his 2005 proposed budget for the federal government on Feb. 2.

But budget experts say while the new Bush budget is likely to be somewhat more austere than previous ones, it will not be radically different.

"There are people in the Republican Party who are becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the high level of spending. The difficulty is going to be controlling spending in an election year," said Maya MacGuineas, executive director of the Committee for a Responsible Budget (search).

In the three years since Bush took office, discretionary spending " money that is not tied to long-term entitlements, including defense, domestic security, education and transportation " has grown by 31.5 percent. Non-discretionary spending " mandatory programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid " has reached record highs.

Overall, federal spending grew on average by 7.6 percent in each of the last two years, more than double the 3.4 percent average annual growth under the Clinton administration.
 
 
@FreeDuck,

Yes, Sarah has shown she can take criticism, even cruel, malicious, sexist, unfair, and dishonest criticism, and she can take it with poise, grace, and good humor without playing the victim in any respect, which is more than I can say of Senator Obama's ability to even take mild criticism. (The issue on the US Magazine was not the writer, but the content which was blatantly dishonest in fact and/or omission--it was the worst kind of yellow journalism and the managing editor who is responsible for all content was justifiably exposed and thoroughly humiliated because of it.)

But I'm still curious as to what your take is on the Oprah flap, FD.
 
 
@Foxfyre,

Fox, It's too spacial for you to understand; Bush promised jobs with his tax cuts that never came. As a matter of fact, the stats provided proof that under Bush, job creation was the worst since 1960.

@Foxfyre,

Lol, that's rich, coming from you, Fox; queen of the non-factual statement, that you refuse to back off of when shown that you are wrong - just like the beginning of this thread, when I used actual data to show that your claims that the race is tied are in fact incorrect.

@Cycloptichorn,

The whole 'McCain represents change' meme is a joke.

 

He represents nothing of the sort. He will continue to do things exactly as Bush has done them on a wide variety of issues. He agrees with Bush on every major issue of our time. How can anyone think that he represents any sort of change at all?

@Foxfyre,

I gave it further up.  Here. 
 
 
Since McCain wants to make Bush's tax cuts permanent, we're going to suffer more job loss. It's really a simple concept, but it requires one to use some common sense and a bit of logic - which you seem to lack.
 
 
@Cycloptichorn,

I won't get into a pissing contest with either of you Cyclop. If you have fun throwing out insults at me, fine. But the fact is CI made a statement that he cannot back up and defends it with personal insults. I try very hard not to do that kind of sophomoric behavior to anybody.

I gave you the source of my data re the status of the race, and did not dismiss your source or call you any names. I do have a quote of yours saved, however, in which you flat out stated that you were not obligated to defend anything you said. So let's not get into this, okay?

I dont see how it can be good for the top of your ticket to be always trying to draw comparisons between Obama and Palin. I am not even sure how Obama enters into this discussion.

Ah, okay. I did miss this. Sorry.

No, Oprah is not stupid. But she does have herself in a bit of a mess re Palin I think.

Why do you say that Palin is not interested in giving interviews? She is, after all, the VP candidate for a whole week, the GOP convention ended last night, and she has been out on the campaign trail doing a lot of pretty emphatic straight talk today. Neither Obama nor Biden were expected to give interviews during their conventions.

@Foxfyre,

Oh, I think the fact that the McCain campaign says she's not 'comfortable' doing interviews and won't be doing any, anytime soon, is a little clue -

 
05 Sep 2008 01:55 pm
A senior McCain campaign official advises that, despite the gaggle of requests and pressure from the media, Gov. Sarah Palin won't submit to a formal interview anytime soon. She may take some questions from local news entities in Alaska, but until she's ready -- and until she's comfortable -- which might not be for a long while -- the media will have to wait. The campaign believes it can effectively deal with the media's complaints, and their on-the-record response to all this will be: "Sarah Palin needs to spend time with the voters."

Not out of the question are appearances on lighter, fluffier television shows. But -- not for a while.

It's basically an admission that she is too weak to be interviewed critically at this point.

@Foxfyre,

 
 
Well, there is a difference between opinion and factual claims, Fox. I'm not surprised that you don't understand that though.

If you don't want people calling you on your bullshit, don't call them out on it, mkay? You accuse CI of doing something that you constantly do yourself. Hypocrisy at its finest.

Cycloptichorn

 

Let's not do this Cyclop. Or I will ask you to back up your statements here. Or is that just opinion too and not a factual claim?

 

Which statements, exactly? I'm not backing down from your mendacity, Fox, out of some desire to keep the peace. Just admit that you are guilty of the same thing you accuse CI of and be done with it.

@Foxfyre,

 
Ah, okay. I did miss this. Sorry.
 

No worries, its easy to miss stuff.

 
No, Oprah is not stupid. But she does have herself in a bit of a mess re Palin I think.
 
Only if it is shown that she isnt being consistent with her promise, I think.

 
Why do you say that Palin is not interested in giving interviews?
 
I said she doesnt seem interested. Cyclop posted something above about it, and Ive been reading that the McCain campaign says she wont be doing any for a while.
 
 
@FreeDuck,

 
 
Yes, Sarah has shown she can take criticism, even cruel, malicious, sexist, unfair, and dishonest criticism, and she can take it with poise, grace, and good humor without playing the victim in any respect, which is more than I can say of Senator Obama's ability to even take mild criticism.
 

I dont see how it can be good for the top of your ticket to be always trying to draw comparisons between Obama and Palin. I am not even sure how Obama enters into this discussion.
 

I think the McCain campaign and his supporters will stop drawing comparisons between McCain/Palin and other appropriate figures when the Obama/Biden campaign and their supporters stop doing that. Do you foresee that happening any time soon? Do you think it is useful for them to do so?

 
 
(The issue on the US Magazine was not the writer, but the content which was blatantly dishonest in fact and/or omission--it was the worst kind of yellow journalism and the managing editor who is responsible for all content was justifiably exposed and thoroughly humiliated because of it.)

 

Is the writer not responsible for the content? Did you read the article?
 

The writer is responsible for the content if the writer is held responsible for the content. The one with the first responsibility to do that is the Managing Editor who also has full ability to delete from or add comments to the article submitted by the writer. Having said that, I'm sure the writer would have received the same dressing down from Megan Kelly that the managing editor received had he been the one on the hotseat. The managing editor was absolutely disgraceful in his attempt to smooth over the magazine's glaringly obvious effort to intentionally smear and slime Sarah Palin, and they did so quite dishonestly from the content to the cover photo and hooks printed there.

And yes, I read the article.

@Cycloptichorn,

 
Oh, I think the fact that the McCain campaign says she's not 'comfortable' doing interviews and won't be doing any, anytime soon, is a little clue -

 
05 Sep 2008 01:55 pm
A senior McCain campaign official advises that, despite the gaggle of requests and pressure from the media, Gov. Sarah Palin won't submit to a formal interview anytime soon. She may take some questions from local news entities in Alaska, but until she's ready -- and until she's comfortable -- which might not be for a long while -- the media will have to wait. The campaign believes it can effectively deal with the media's complaints, and their on-the-record response to all this will be: "Sarah Palin needs to spend time with the voters."

Well the last time I am aware of was yesterday during Obama's called press conference in which he pretty thoroughly bashed McCain and Palin with all kinds of unflattering comparisons when he compared them to himself and Biden. And he did this a few hours before McCain's acceptance speech. And since we are drawing comparisons here, McCain ran a very nice ad congratulating Senator Obama several times during the day and evening of Obama's acceptance speech.

Oh good Lord, I would never buy or seek out a magazine like US. I only knew of it when the side by side comparisons of how US Magazine treated Obama versus how it treated Palin were posted on the Drudge Report. And I found the article itself somewhere else on the internet, but I honestly don't remember where now

Yes. He is a class act.

Here is what I know about the ad they released.

It doesnt say when they released it, but factcheck is usually at least a day behind so the would be Wednesday or earlier.
 
 
@FreeDuck,

No, I haven't seen a transcript of the press conference yesterday, but there's probably one out there somewhere. I heard several pieces of it on the radio while out keeping appointments yesterday.

And what does the Factcheck.org evaluation of a campaign ad have anything to do with the complimentary ad McCain ran on Obama's behalf a week ago Thursday?
 
 
@Foxfyre,

I said earlier that it was the McCain camp who were making the comparison and that they did so in a campaign ad. Im just backing that up with a link to the ad I referenced, since that is what we were talking about.
 
 
@Foxfyre,

I found the press conference you were talking about  here . I watched the whole thing and didnt see him make a single comparison between himself and Palin. So I have no reason to believe it is anyone but the McCain camp making these comparisons. Do you think its a good idea to let the vp pick overshadow the top of the ticket? Its as if McCain isnt even in the room anymore.

Holy cow. Are you serious here? You can watch that press conference and not see him drawing comparisons between them and him in every respect? And he after all called the press conference for the purpose of responding to Palin's speech Wednesday night. McCain hadn't given his yet.

And his answers were so completely dishonest on several points, I found myself actually disliking him for the very first time. That is not good.

@FreeDuck,

Duck, he started out the press conference drawing a comparison between himself and Palin. Remember the press conference was called, in my opinion, to try to diffuse her enormous success Wednesday night. McCain hadn't spoken yet. Who else was he making comparisons with other than what she said on Wednesday night? He ticked off what she hadn't said.....in some detail.

A reporter asked him why his campaign was diminishing her accomplishments and experience. He backpedaled a bit on that, because they certainly HAVE made such statements, but only in an offhand way.

Some other different comments:

Obama spokesman Bill Burton:

 
Today, John McCain put the former mayor of a town of 9,000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency. Governor Palin shares John McCain's commitment to overturning Roe v. Wade, the agenda of Big Oil and continuing George Bush's failed economic policies -- that's not the change we need, it's just more of the same.
 http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0808/Obama_campaign_blasts_Palin.html 
 

 
Barack Obama's campaign -- thrown for a loop like the rest of the political world by John McCain's stunning choice of Sarah Palin as his running mate -- is trying to adjust on the fly.

After initially sending out a blistering statement belittling the first-term Alaska governor as "the former mayor of a town of 9,000 with zero foreign policy experience," the Democratic nominee's camp has since taken a two-track strategy.

The candidate, himself, is nodding to the historic nature of her selection, while emphasizing the argument that she, like McCain, represents a continuation of President Bush. Obama's first TV ad on Palin makes the same point -- trying to rebut the McCain campaign portraying her as a younger maverick reformer who will shake up Washington.

"Well, he’’s made his choice," the announcer says in the Obama spot. "But, for the rest of us, there’’s still no change. McCain doesn’’t get it, calling this broken economy 'strong.' Wants to keep spending $10 billion a month in Iraq. And votes with George Bush 90 percent of the time.

"So, while this may be his running-mate," the announcer says over an image of McCain with Palin, "America knows this is John McCain’’s agenda," with an image of McCain and Bush. "And we can’’t afford four more years of the same."

But on a separate track, Obama's campaign is continuing to rip the choice of Palin, sending out one critical article or editorial after another and accusing him of pandering to women and to the religious right.

And Obama's surrogates are trying to make the case that McCain failed his first true test of leadership, picking someone unqualified even though he had said repeatedly that his first criteria for selection was someone who could step in as president if, God forbid, something happened to him.

@Foxfyre,

I just watched the same thing, and Fox - you're full of shit. He didn't compare himself to Palin at all. He spoke about what she didn't speak about. He laughed off her pathetic attempts at insult.

Geez, you live in an alternate world, yaknow that?

Now, for more interesting fare:

 
Obama: 'Not about the issues' comment means making stuff up
Posted: 04:45 PM ET

From CNN Political Producer Alexander Marquardt

DURYEA, Pennsylvania (CNN) " Barack Obama continued to hammer the McCain campaign on Friday for manager Rick Davis’s comments that the election would be more about the candidates’ personas, not the issues. The Illinois senator said he’s not running for president for his “pretty good personality” and that it’s a sign Republicans intend to scare voters away from him with false accusations of Muslim and radical connections.

“When [the Republicans] say this isn’t about issues it’s about personalities what they’re really saying is “we’re going to try to scare people about Barack”,” he told a small gathering at a glass factory near Scranton. “”We’re going to say that you know, maybe he’s got Muslim connections or we’re going to say that, you know, he hangs out with radicals or he’s not patriotic.” Just making stuff up.”

“I mean I think I’ve got a pretty good personality! But that’s not why I am running for president,” Obama said, later adding, “If you want it to be about personalities, you know, we’ll go out for a beer sometime and we’ll talk but you know you don’t have time, you’d rather spend it with your family.”

Obama has repeatedly hit Republicans this week of for lacking substance at their convention in St. Paul and consistently brands the G0P as out of touch.

“If you’ve got the kind of record they’ve got over the last eight years then, of course, you don’t want to spend a lot of time talking about the issues,” said Obama. He blasted McCain on the economy, called his energy plan “made for TV” and accused the Arizona senator of having no education plan.

“Apparently Barack Obama was not listening when John McCain and Sarah Palin offered their plans to keep taxes low and create new jobs,” responded RNC spokesman Alex Conant. “On the other hand, Barack Obama’s economic policies would only raise taxes and eliminate jobs.”

Obama gave a lengthy defense during the Q&A portion of the event when a woman asked about rumors that he was going to take away their guns, an issue that has gotten him in some hot water in the past.

“I think this is a great question so I just want to clear it up,” he started. “The 2nd amendment is an individual right and it means something: that people have a right to bear arms. What I also believe is that there’s nothing wrong with some common sense gun safety measures.”

“The bottom line is this: if you’ve got a rifle, you’ve got a shotgun, you’ve got a gun in your house, I’m not taking it away,” he said, adding that even if he wanted to, he couldn’t get it through Congress.

“I hope I made that clear,” he wrapped up, “Is everybody clear back there in the back? ‘Cause I see a couple sportsmen back there. All right? Spread the word with your friends. I’m not going to take away your guns.”

@Foxfyre,

Fox, do you understand what a comparison is? I dont see anything wrong with the way the campaign has responded in the bits you quoted, but they are not drawing a comparison between Obama and Palin. What is it that you see? Responding to the attacks by Palin and Giuliani (among others) is necessary and fair. But thats not the same as comparing himself to Palin.
 
 
@FreeDuck,

It could be a difference in perception. In a political campaign, I don't see comparisons as being I am black, she is white or I am Democrat, she is Republican, etc. I see the comparisons as being drawn between what "I" offer versus what 'she' offers, "I" am qualified, "she isn't" etc. That is what he did or at least implied. Nobody can tell me that wasn't the purpose of the press conference called just hours before McCain's acceptance speech.

Sorry, no, thats not what he did. Obviously, this is a campaign, both are going to say why they think theyre better than the other party. But Obama made no direct comparison between himself and Gov. Palin. And to my knowledge, neither has his campaign. The fact remains that it is the McCain camp that is drawing the comparison. I am asking why you think that is.
 
 
@Cycloptichorn,

Last Sunday morning on ABC, George Will suggested that people will vote according to values rather than issues. According to Will, Palin will energize the base of the Republican party because she chose to carry a Down's syndrome baby to full term.

He said it in just those terms? I do believe those who are strong pro-life proponents in the party are giving her a huge thumbs up for her choice to carry Trigg to full term. He is a person you know, a human being with a name and a capacity for joy and love, much more than just a "Down's syndrome baby". True pro-lifers do not believe in a 'designer children' policy in which you abort the imperfect until you get the one you want.

You may disagree strongly with such pro-lifers, but the fact is they are out there and they are part of the base. And they have as much right to appreciate a candidate who shares their convictions as you have the right to appreciate a candidate who thinks it is okay to kill the aborted fetus that survives since the intention was to kill it anyway.

And that is just one of many MANY issues for which there are clear differences between the candidates. (And no, I don't wish to debate the pros and cons of pro choice and pro life here. Let's just recognize what each is and understand the position of our respective candidates.)

That is interesting though too far off into conspiracy land for me at the moment. I wish I knew more about her, though. It bothers me that someone so unknown could end up being president when it isnt likely she could have gotten her partys nomination for that office from the voters in the primary.
 
 
@FreeDuck,

When you see McCain's 96 year-old-mother easily getting up out of her chair for standing ovations, grinning ear to ear, and giving entirely coherant and intelligent interviews, the probability of him finishing one, even two terms is certainly more plausible than not. I think he has wanted this chance for far too long to quickly give up the opportunity should he prevail in November.

The one that may be in the quandary is Hillary. I think she sincerely does not want Obama to beat McCain because then she will have to wait eight long years for her next attempt. But what if she faces Sarah Palin in four years instead of McCain? Would that be a scary concept for her?

I think a whole lot of us are not having a hard time imagining a President Palin if she continues to present herself as capably as she has thus far.

Interesting stuff may be going on behind the scenes these days. (Speaking of conspiracy theories though I think maybe mine is more plausible than DTOMs.   )

They can and do play just as down and dirty as anybody else. Which was my whole point all along.

I don't think it is necessary to dissect every component that goes into my point in order to recognize that this is my point.

Nobody could ever show you just how spectacularly wrong you've been over the years because you're unable to part with your preconceived, ill thought out notions.

The last eight years have been such a monstrous failure and the plain truth is you know it. This is where your preconceived, ill thought out notions are replaced by a mendacity that defies belief.

 
Senator Biden:

“It’s not merely a lost job, it’s a lost sense of identity. I don’t think my Republican friends " and this is not your father’s Republican party, by the way. So folks, when I listen to the parts of the Republican convention I can hear…it’s not what I heard, it’s what I didn’t hear. The silence of the Republican party was deafening. It was deafening on jobs, on health care, on the environment, on all the things that matter to the people in the neighborhood’s I grew up in. Deafening! Their America is not the America I live in. They see something different than I see.

“Rick Davis, John’s campaign manager, said ‘this election is not about issues.’ Everything I saw at the convention demonstrated that.

“What do you talk about about when you have nothing to say? What do you talk about when you can’t explain the last eight years of failure?”

Wait. You saw nothing wrong in the excerpts, yet you used them to illustrate your point, which is that the Obama campaign can and do play just as down and dirty as anybody else. So, harmless quotes equals down and dirty. Do I have that right?

 
I don't think it is necessary to dissect every component that goes into my point in order to recognize that this is my point.
 

This is your point? After talking about who is making the comparisons between Obama and Palin, and going round and round about whether Obama did it in a press conference (with the revolver), it turns out that your point all along is that the Obama campaign is not pure of heart?
 
 
@JTT,

I think the Democrats would be a lot less boring if they would just become educated enough to know that President Bush isn't running in this election. But whatever. Keep the focus there and stew in that theme while McCain/Palin pull away and go for the prize.
 
 
@DontTreadOnMe,

Constitution addresses it.

She can run for one more term if you fills 3 1/2 years of the previous

 
Amendment XXII

Section 1. No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.

FD, we were having a conversation in which I obviously was on a different track than you. That isn't an unusual circumstance between you and me. I will agree to disagree on this if you will. I could go back and recap every comment, what I said, what I intended, what I meant, what I was saying and all we will accomplish is boring everybody out of their minds. And you will continue to reframe the question in so slightly different ways and Cyclop will continue to make ad hominem comments and we won't discuss anything that is meaningful to anybody. Is such minutia that important to you?

I think Obama and his spokespersons are constantly drawing comparisons between himself and his opponents and I am 100% certain that is what he was doing yesterday. And I am 100% certain that he did it yesterday in an attempt to derail the traction the Republicans and especially Sarah Palin were getting. I accept that you disagree with that and see it entirely differently. So lets agree to disagree and not bore everybody out of their gourd. Okay?

I agree. Thats what he is supposed to do with McCain, with the Republicans in general, but not specifically against the vp candidate, which is what I was talking about. Maybe you didnt understand the exact phenomenon I was talking about.

 
And I am 100% certain that he did it yesterday in an attempt to derail the traction the Republican were getting. I accept that you disagree with that and see it entirely differently.
 
I agree that he was defending himself against the attacks. Thats what we would expect him to do. And yes, lets just let it go.
 
 
@Foxfyre,

Did I mention that your ill conceived notions often move into straight out mendacity. If you were able to see that, yes, Bush and his idiotic programs are indeed part and parcel of this election, you wouldn't plump for a repeat of abject failure?

Why do you hate America so much?
 
 
Meanwhile, I think this unfolding drama may NOT bore everybody out of their gourds. Good soap opera here:

 
....here are five reasons why O(prah) should have Palin on:

1.) To talk about motherhood, her family and Bristol; if you're really hung up on politics, O, then this doesn't have to be a "political" debriefing at all, per se, but a larger look at even more important issues, which your show claims to care about.

2.) It'd get a huge number. Hell yeah! Perhaps one of the biggest numbers in "O" history. This is a mercenary business, O, in case you've forgotten.

3.) It'd get the show back to that sweet spot of "relevance" and "news-worthiness." Wonderful to have all 150-or-so Olympians on Monday's season premiere, but the Olympics are old news; Palin is fresh news.

4.) Of course, it's O's right to support Obama in whatever forum she chooses, but she's simply too transcendent - her word - a cultural figure to pretend she's lil' ol' objective and non-political Oprah on her show, and yet Obama's most important supporter in the WORLD when she's not on screen. That's a silly artifice, transparent to all. Why not get Palin on and say, "OK, lady, I happen to think this guy walks on water. Now you tell me why he doesn't, and let's go at this." That would be great TV, and far better than a dreary debate between Palin and Joe Biden.

5.) O helped secure at least a million addition votes for Obama but probably lost hundreds of thousands of McCain supporter-viewers - if not more - to her show in the process. Here's her chance to say to everyone, "I have a right to support whomever I choose, and now to prove to you just how open-minded I am, here's the gun-toting mama from Alaska on the show."

In his convention speech, McCain, the self-appointed agent of change, set forth a goal of REVERTING to the past. He said, "The party of Lincoln, Roosevelt and Reagan is going to get back to basics." McCain then recited the basics of Reaganomics. It's the old trickle-down economic plan that involves the wealthiest families and corporate America splashing around in a big pool of wealth with the hope that maybe a drop or two from their splashing prosperity will fall upon the working people. But, if people recall, Reagan's trickle-down economic plan was an utter failure and he had to RAISE taxes--more than once!

How can McCain make trickle-down economics work when it has never worked in the past? After all, the premise is fatally flawed. The rich get richer and the poor get poorer and the country sinks further into recession. An occasional tax rebate that makes it possible for working people to spend a couple hundred dollars at Wal Mart isn't going to create jobs or keep people from losing their homes.

In response, Foxfyre wrote:

Do you favor Obama's suggestion to limit drilling offshore and elsewhere but send everybody $1000 to offset high energy costs? If not, why? If so, why?

****

Foxfyre: If Obama adopted the same old failed policy of trickle-down economics that McCain has adopted when this country is $9 trillion in debt and then sent every family a $1000 check, I would denouce him as fiscally irresponsible. But, that's not Obama's economic plan.

Personally, I own mineral rights and drilling would definitely serve MY financial interests. Drill Baby Drill! Oh wait. Our national reserves of oil, even using the most optimistic estimates, are not enough to satisfy our needs. Our only choice, as a nation, is to develop renewable sources of energy.

Before McCain flipflopped on the issue of offshore drilling, McCain said, "With those resources, which would take years to develop, you would only postpone or temporarily relieve our dependency on fossil fuels." McCain emphasized that we must devote our efforts to alternative energy sources because we need those alternatives SOONER rather than later. By flipflopping on this issue, McCain isn't serving the interests of the people. Instead, McCain is serving the interests of big oil tycoons and their lobbyists who clearly have a vested interest in seeing those energy alternatives come much LATER rather than sooner.

I perceive whining because Palin, a woman candidate, is the subject of media scrutiny. Here's what I have to say about that:

 
Did Palin Call Hillary Clinton a Whiner?

September 02, 2008 7:49 PM

ABC News' Eloise Harper reports: Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, in a video interview with Newsweek, posted on YouTube, discussed the coverage of Sen. Hillary Clinton. In an interview that appears to have taken place during the Democratic primary, Palin criticizes Clinton for her response to media scrutiny she received while on the campaign trail.

Palin says, "When I hear a statement like that coming from a woman candidate with any kind of perceived whine about that excess criticism or, you know, maybe a sharper microscope put on her, I think, man, that doesn’t do us any good. Women in politics, women in general wanting to progress this country. I don’t think it’s, it bodes well for her -- a statement like that."
 
 
 
LIAR, LIAR, PALIN'S SKIRT ON FIRE (again):

Alaska state jet didn't fly on eBay
Posted: 07:19 PM ET

From CNN Correspondent Christine Romans

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (CNN) " Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin bolstered her fiscal-conservative credentials early in her term by putting her predecessor's state jet up for auction online.

"That luxury jet was over the top," she told Republican National Convention delegates when she accepted the party's vice presidential nomination Wednesday night. "I put it on eBay."

Since Palin was chosen as Arizona Sen. John McCain's running mate last week, the story has become a cornerstone of the Republican effort to paint Palin as a reformer who took on her own party establishment.

"How many saw her speech a couple of nights ago? Wasn't it fabulous?" McCain said Friday during a campaign stop in Cedarburg, Wisconsin. "You know what I enjoyed the most? She took the luxury jet that was purchased by her predecessor and sold it on eBay " and made a profit."

But it turns out the twin-engine Westwind II was a tough sell on the Web " and the state eventually pulled it offline and sold it through an ordinary brick-and-mortar brokerage, for a loss, a spokeswoman said Friday.

"Governor Palin has been correct in saying that she put the plane on eBay," McCain campaign spokeswoman Maria Comella told CNN. "They did end up selling it for $2.1 million. but not on eBay."

@cicerone imposter,

Now that's where we differ. You see, I do have faith that the American voters will see through the shinny veneer of Obama. American voters who put the two Presidential candidates in the balance, I'm sure will be able to know to a reasonable certainty that McCain will meet every challenge with courage and integrity, while Obama's rhetoric may fail when put to the acid test. The American voters who live quiet lives and deal with problems, I'm sure will identify more with Gov. Palin, than with Obama. Those who want to see changes in Washington, will recognize that the GOP slate have demonstrated that they are willing to fight for change, whereas Obama only talks about it.

I have faith in the American People to be able to separate glowing, but empty promises from those who have already risked their personal political careers to challenge entrenched partisan interests.
 
 
@Foxfyre,

Foxfyre wrote: "Yes, Sarah has shown she can take criticism, even cruel, malicious, sexist, unfair, and dishonest criticism, and she can take it with poise, grace, and good humor without playing the victim in any respect, which is more than I can say of Senator Obama's ability to even take mild criticism."

That is NOT true. The "pitbull with lipstick," as she describes herself, who criticized Clinton for a whining about media scrutiny, by and through one of her party handlers, was screaming SEXISM. See:

 
ST. PAUL, Minnesota (CNN) " Senior McCain adviser Carly Fiorina said Tuesday that Barack Obama, Joe Biden and other Democrats were engaging in sexist attacks on Sarah Palin, as Republicans continued to invoke Hillary Clinton to criticize the Democratic presidential ticket.

“I am appalled by the Obama campaign's attempts to belittle Governor Sarah Palin’s experience,” said Fiorina. “The facts are that Sarah Palin has made more executive decisions as a Mayor and Governor than Barack Obama has made in his life.

“Because of Hillary Clinton's historic run for the Presidency and the treatment she received, American women are more highly tuned than ever to recognize and decry sexism in all its forms. They will not tolerate sexist treatment of Governor Palin.”

Fiorina pointed to a Monday interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper, when Obama responded to GOP arguments that Palin had more executive experience than he or Biden did.

“Well, my understanding is that Governor Palin's town of Wasilla has I think 50 employees,” he said. “We've got 2,500 in this campaign. I think their budget is maybe $12 million a year. You know, we have a budget of about three times that just for the month. So I think that our ability to manage large systems and to execute I think has been made clear over the last couple of years.”

She also pointed to a comment Biden made on the trail over the weekend, when he joked with the crowd at a campaign event that one of the “obvious differences” between him and Palin was that she is “good looking.”
 

Let's see. Palin claims that she has more executive experience than Obama. When Obama responds by comparing his experience to hers, she calls him sexist.
 
 
@FreeDuck,

The muckraking liberal press will dredge the swamps looking for anything at all to smear Gov. Palin. If they can find something like, say a 20 year membership in a church presided over by a racist minister who has been her close adviser, mentor and friend, then we might have some trouble. If the Democrats can show that she's had the support and friendship of an unrepentant Weather Underground Terrorist, then maybe she should step aside.

Are we talking about the same GOP? 'cause, I could have swore that they were the ones who have been governing for the last 8 years. What changes is McCain going to make, that would be so far away from the Bush way of doing things? They agree on nearly every issue, and McCain's campaign is ran by the same Rove operatives that put Bush in power. What fighting for change has the GOP demonstrated, exactly?

No, I'm afraid that you have simply fallen for the bullshit, Ash. McCain represents no actual change and not even a desire for change; just an attempt to steal a successful slogan, in a year where people have signaled they are upset with the way things have been done.

newsflash; voting for someone other than the gop is not hating america. it's democracy.
 
 
Real pleasant conversation here! haha.

I guess the state of affairs now, in this country is, since ordinary politicians are considered fuddy duddy anymore, and out of date, and since the Dems came up with their messiah to lead them to the promised land, It is coming clear now that the only way to combat this was for the Republicans to come up with their own rock star, enter Sarah Palin. Don't get me wrong, I'm not sure Sarah wants to be the rock star, but that is how this has evolved. Hey, I heard today that optomitrists were being called with requests for glasses designed like Palins.

If anybody can convince me that this is the way politics has always been in this country, I would be favorably inclined to listen, but otherwise I think we have now entered a new phase of politics. I realize JFK was a rockstar, but on this level, I doubt it. And we have a new twist to this whole thing, political correctness, which involves gender and race. Everyone wants to get into the act to prove they are so with it these days, so politically correct, and so liberated and open minded, never mind issues and principles. Now, you read articles about how so neat it is that either a woman vp or a black president will gain office, no mention of political issues. I don't know, but I wonder if pop culture has now suddenly invaded politics in a very serious way, something that we will not recover from very easily, without some pretty traumatic experiences to cure the sick society that we now have.

Let's see. Palin claims that she has more executive experience than Obama. When Obama responds by comparing his experience to hers, she calls him sexist.

 

Wow, your so blind with hatred you can't even use basic reading comprehension. And you're a lwayer? Scary. It's like you aren't even trying to look at anything with any semblance of education or intelligence.

You do realize that Fiorina is not Palin right? I mean you are capable of making that distinction, right?

Then, Obama has the distinction of comparing her being a mayor to his running a campaign? Why not use her term as Governor instead? I suppose that would be too difficult for the boy wonder...
 
 
@cicerone imposter,

Obama, of course, is the rock star whose demise will come on 04NOV, the only poll worth spit.
 
 
@JTT,

Let's just keep this nice and simple. Palin's "dirty laundry" compared to Obama's "dirty laundry". Palin's experience, or lack thereof, compared to Obama's lack of experience. One has finagled his way to the top of the ticket, and the other was plucked from relative obscurity to be Vice-President by a national hero. One talks change, and the other has actually risked their political career to make change.

People in glass houses shouldn't throw brickbats.
 
 
Also when Obama compared his experience to Palin's he stated it like this:

 
“Well, my understanding is that Governor Palin’s town of Wasilla has, I think, 50 employees. We’ve got 2,500 in this campaign. I think their budget is maybe $12 million a year. You know, we have a budget of about three times that just for the month. So I think that our ability to manage large systems and to execute I think has been made clear over the last couple of years,” Obama said.
 

And while he claims running his campaign gives him superior executive experience to hers (and presumably the necessary experience to be President), he sort of omits the fact that she had to run a successful campaign to become Mayor and also a successful campaign to become Governor of Alaska with a $10 billion budget and responsibility for about 24000 employees not to mention ability to supervise people in charge of critical services and the National Guard.

But running a campaign qualifies you to be President. Really? Wow. I too can be president. I can start campaigning today and have more than four years solid executive experience by 2012! Who knew?

Seriously, I don't think "sexist" sounds like a word Palin would use in defense of herself. I, and many others, though recognize it when we see it and have used it quite a bit on her behalf.

And you're ignorant. I don't find that "scary," I find that sad. When a principle authorizes his/her duly appointed agent to issue a press release, the agent is conveying the principle's message.
 
 
@Cycloptichorn,

Actually, the Democrats have controlled the Congress since the last major election, and this Congress has done virtually nothing. The Democrats in Congress even before that did everything in their power to derail every initiative the Administration asked for. No Administration, by either Party, can enact even the most essential legislation in the face of determined opposition.

Congress has sat on its hands and feathered its nest for over two hundred years. Getting elected means keeping the constituency happy, and that always has meant pork. Politicians in both Parties have been guilty of that, and of placing Partisan politics above the common good. Occasionally in our history, Congress rises above it's venial nature, but not often. Congress historically gets behind the national effort when the nation is under attack and our military is bleeding on foreign soil. The Democratic Party has in large measure adopted a defeatist approach to the use of our military forces against Extremist Islamic Radicals.

The change that Obama seems to promise is to withdraw American might back within CONUS, no matter what the probable result might be. Leave Iran to develop nuclear weapons and to dominate a strategically important region. He apparently will avoid confrontations, so if Russia wants to reoccupy Georgia, Turkistan, Lithuania, Lativia, Poland, etc., an Obama Administration will respond by wringing its hands. Obama wants change, like trusting Kim Jong-Il to keep his promises. Obama, like many Democrats, wants to change things by redirecting all that money the U.S. spends on the military to pay for increased federal social programs.

Of course, the military budget can never pay for all the promises that Obama makes, so he promises to change the way Americans are taxed. Tax's will have to be increased dramatically, but Obama claims that "average" Americans won't suffer from increased taxation. Only the "rich", only businesses will have to face an increased tax burden. Sure, kill the goose for the golden egg. Make it more difficult to make a profit by increasing overhead, and business stop doing business. Entrepreneurs, the backbone of our economy, are already so hemmed in by regulation and taxation that its smarter to get out of business than to start one. Small businesses and wage earners will bear the brunt of Obama's grand schemes.

McClain isn't a popular man even with career GOP politicians. Why is that? I suggest it's because he has a long reputation for putting the nation's interests above the interests of elected and appointed politicians. He has fought corruption wherever its been found, regardless of which Party is involved. He has been tireless in trying to cut wasteful spending that has as its principle purpose getting politicians reelected. He has stepped across the battle lines to enlist the support and aid of the opposition party to enact campaign reform. When the Congress on both sides of aisle became disenchanted with the way things were going in Iraq and wanted to get out as quickly as possible without regard for the consequences, it was McCain who called for the military surge that turned the situation around. McCain stood up and voted against Regan, and he has opposed Bush as well. McCain is not a grandstander, like most politicians.

He isn't a perfect man, but no one is. He knows war, and its costs better than most, so when McCain calls for the use of military force it is because he truly believes it is necessary. He is a maverick alright, he still holds close the fundamental values that made this nation great. He still believes in self sacrifice, honor, loyalty and courage in a world that has become soft and unwilling to take responsiblity, or risks when they are called for.
 
 
And, McCain/Palin supporters and leaners, bookmark this one to use the next time somebody tries to claim that Obama shuns the big money donors in favor of nickle and dimes contributed by the grass roots on the internet:

 
Bon Jovi and his wife, Dorothea, hosted more than 100 people for dinner on their mansion lawn by the Navesink River in Middletown, N.J. The price was $30,800 a person, to be divided between the Obama campaign and the Democratic National Committee.

"When I look at Barack, I see an old man," Bon Jovi said in introducing his guest. Obama is 47, Bon Jovi is 46.

Obama spoke for about eight minutes before greeting guests individually. He vowed to fight Republican attacks on his character and background more fiercely than John Kerry did in his losing campaign four years ago.

"We're not going to be bullied, we're not going to be smeared, we're not going to be lied about," Obama said. "I don't believe in coming in second."

@Asherman,

Good analysis Ash. Sadly few who need to read it will do so and even fewer will understand what it is that you are saying. The ONLY chance the Dems have to make their candidate(s) look good against McCain/Palin is to paint them as "McSame" however dishonest it is to do that.
 
 
@Asherman,

Simple has always more than filled the bill for you, Asherman.

"The other was plucked from relative obscurity"

Now that's an understatement. And yet, WHAT a plus. How do you ever come up with these incisive analysis?

There's no risk in a Republican breaking the law to advance their career. You lot slurp it up.

And this national hero crap, please. You've sat, eyes all a mist while honest John has reveled you with stories of his derring do. He got medals for nothing other than being a POW. Yup, he's real Audie Murphy. You talk yourself into this nonsense.
 
 
I wonder who can read the following and NOT find it thought provoking? Especially the last line? "This is an election, as the Democrats have realised all along, about an America on the cusp of change. With the moose-hunting, establishment-taunting Mrs Palin at his side, Mr McCain might represent a bigger change than the one that his opponents are offering. "

 
So let's stipulate one obvious and important piece of wisdom about US elections. The choice of a vice-presidential candidate rarely makes much of a difference....

This one, to be fair, could be different. For at least the next few weeks the press will follow Mrs Palin's present and dig deeper into her past, still hoping for some morsel of stupidity or evidence of cupidity to doom her. But in the end, barring such a discovery, this is still an Obama-McCain contest.

But let me try to explain why Mrs Palin, whatever impact she might have in November, may be a figure of real consequence in our lives.

It's partly about what she represents and partly about what she has already done, but mostly about where she and her ilk might take the Republicans - and possibly America.

It never ceases to amaze me how the Left falls again and again into the old trap of underestimating politicians whom they don't understand. From Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher to George Bush and Mrs Palin, they do it every time. Because these characters talk a bit funny and have ridiculously antiquated views about faith, family and nation, because they haven't spent time bending the knee to the intellectual metropolitan elites, they can't be taken seriously.

So the general expectation was that Mrs Palin would stumble on to the stage in high heels, clutching her sprawling, slightly odd family (five children! how weird), mispronounce the name of the Russian Prime Minister, mutter a few platitudes about God, and disappear for ever to a deafening chorus of sniggers.

No one paid much attention to the fact that she had been elected governor of a state. Or that she got to that office not because, unlike some politicians I could mention, her husband had been there before her, or because she bleated continuously about glass ceilings, but by challenging the entrenched interests in her own party and beating them. In almost two years as Governor she has cleaned out the Augean stables of Alaskan Government. You don't win a statewide election and enjoy approval ratings of more than 80 per cent without real political talent.

Never mind all that. She didn't have a passport! She was a former beauty queen! It was so axiomatic that she was a disaster that I was told by lots of savvy men - with deliciously unconscious sexism - that the real problem was what the choice said about Mr McCain and his judgment: cynical, irresponsible, clueless. It was as if Mrs Palin wasn't really a human being at all, but an article of Mr McCain's clothing that showed his poor taste, like wearing brown shoes with a charcoal suit.

So here's why she matters.

First of all she offers an opportunity for an ailing Republican party to reconnect with ordinary Americans. She's conservative, but her conservatism is not that of the intolerant, uncomprehending white male sort that has so hurt the party in recent years. She is much closer to a model of the lives of ordinary Americans - working mother, plainspoken everywoman juggling home and office - than any Republican leader in memory.

The contrast with Mr Obama is especially powerful. The very fact that Mrs Palin didn't go to elite schools but succeeded nonetheless - the very ordinariness with which she so piquantly jabbed Mr Obama on Wednesday - is what will make her so appealing to Americans. And as a pro-life conservative she debunks in one swoop the enduring myth that all women subscribe to the obligatory nostrums of radical feminism.

But there's more to it than that.

The Republicans have decided that they are not going to make the mistake Hillary Clinton made and run against the effervescent Mr Obama on the premise of experience.

Experience hasn't got Americans into a very comfortable place. They want change. Before he signed up to some of the less attractive Republican attitudes this year, Mr McCain's career had embodied that change - the anti-establishment candidate running against his own party. Now he is joined by a woman who, in her short career, has done the same thing.

Democrats think that Mr McCain, with the social conservative Mrs Palin, will launch an old-fashioned culture war at them, using her appealing manner to drive a populist assault on the familiar Republican issues of God, guns and gays.

Perhaps this Manichean interpretation will prove true. But I suspect that it misses the real appeal of the Republican team. The opportunity for McCain-Palin is not reaction, but reform - a reform rooted in a distant conservatism that could be due for a comeback

Hailing from Arizona and Alaska, the Republican ticket has a chance to rekindle a western conservatism different from the old Yankee paternalist sort or the Bible Belt version. They like their guns out there (some still kill their own food) and they are pro-life and deeply pro-America, of course. But at a time of grave challenges, the themes of economic freedom and opportunity, the resistance to the idea that government holds all the answers, could resonate with voters.

This is an election, as the Democrats have realised all along, about an America on the cusp of change. With the moose-hunting, establishment-taunting Mrs Palin at his side, Mr McCain might represent a bigger change than the one that his opponents are offering.

@Debra Law,

Debra Law Says: Let's see. Palin claims that she has more executive experience than Obama. When Obama responds by comparing his experience to hers, she calls him sexist.

You twist the facts.

Obama initially described his experience as a commuity organizer as comparable to that of a Mayor. That comment by Obama was an insult to the thousands of Mayors of small towns.

Not diminishing Obama efforts, but Mayors are responsible for :
Town Budgets
Town employees
Police/Firefighters
Roads and infrastructure

Most importantly, they are ELECTED by the people.
 
 
Ultimately, after the media and the numbnuts run out of insults, slurs, and smears, the voters will hopefully turn back to the issues before they make up their mind who to vote for.

Here's an interesting piece from Forbes Magazine comparing the tax policy of the two Presidential candidates:

Excerpt: Ironically, today it is the Republican John McCain who is proposing the tax policies of President Kennedy, which led to the economic boom of the 1960s, rather than the Democratic nominee, Barack Obama. Indeed, what Mr. Obama is proposing is the opposite of Kennedy's tax policies...

...On both taxes and spending, the contrast between these two candidates could not be greater. And Mr. McCain would seem to have the popular stance on both scores in the current political climate. His campaign should be centrally focused on these issues, not on distracting personality debates.

 
John F. McCain
Peter Ferrara 08.29.08, 6:00 PM ET

The best components of John McCain's campaign are his tax and budget proposals. These are crafted to counter our currently wobbly economy and restore economic growth. So why on earth doesn't he talk about them more?

On taxes, America suffers from the second-highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world. American corporations face a 35% federal tax rate, averaging 40% with state income taxes. In contrast, the average corporate tax rate in the European Union has been slashed from 38% in 1996 to 24% today. Ireland has a corporate tax rate of 12.5%, which has caused per capita income to soar from the second lowest in the E.U. 20 years ago to the second highest today. Corporate tax rates in India and China are lower as well.

How are American corporations supposed to compete? How are they supposed to provide good jobs at good wages while paying tax rates that are two-thirds higher than their competitors, and more?

Mr. McCain addresses this problem directly by proposing to slash the federal corporate-tax rate from 35% to 25%. He also proposes immediate expensing for capital investment, which means that capital costs can be deducted in the year they are incurred, like all other business expenses, rather than spread over many years under arbitrary depreciation schedules. Making the Bush tax cuts permanent, as Mr. McCain has pledged to do, would leave the top individual income-tax rate at 35%, the capital gains and dividends tax rates at 15% and eliminate the repetitive death tax. He would also double the personal exemption for children and other dependents from $3,500 to $7,000.

Mr. McCain proposes to abolish the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), which was originally adopted as a mechanism to ensure that a small number of the richest Americans pay at least some tax. Because it was never indexed for inflation, today it imposes sharp, surprise tax increases on the middle class in the highest-tax states. Since it was never intended to be a big tax increase on the American people, Mr. McCain argues it should be eliminated. He also pledges to ban taxes on the Internet and on cell phones, consistent with his longstanding record.

These policies seem to be exactly what the economy needs. Besides eliminating the huge competitive disadvantage for American corporations internationally, these policies would spur investment. This would shore up the dollar, leaving the Fed more room to boost the economy. New and existing businesses would surge and expand hiring, producing more jobs and higher wages.

Barack Obama, by contrast, seems to have proposed tax-rate increases for just about every federal tax. He proposes to increase the top two individual tax rates. He would increase the capital gains tax rate by 33%. Ditto that for the tax rate on dividends. He has proposed Social Security payroll tax increases of 16% to 32% for families making over $250,000 a year (that would have a minor effect on the long-term Social Security deficit while arbitrarily punishing these families with effective negative real rates of return from Social Security). Mr. Obama's health plan would also impose a new payroll tax on employers. He would reinstitute the "death tax" (estate tax) with a top rate of 45%. He has also proposed several increases in corporate taxes, including a "windfall profits" tax on oil. Nothing Obama said in his speech Thursday night changed these troublesome proposals.

Mr. Obama's protectionist trade policies would also result in higher tariffs. In contrast, Mr. McCain has even proposed tax cuts here, pledging to repeal the 54 cents per gallon tariff on sugar-based ethanol, as well as sugar import quotas, which should help to lower prices for gas and food. Unlike Mr. Obama, Mr. McCain also favors the Colombian Free Trade Agreement, which would primarily remove tariffs on American imports into that country, with barriers to Colombian exports in America already almost completely removed under the Andean Trade Preferences Act. Mr. McCain's longstanding support for free trade would also seem to be far better for the economy than Mr. Obama's protectionism.

@Foxfyre,

As the previous article is lengthy and somewhat tedious to read, here is a summary.

American corporations 35% federal tax rate averaging 40% with state income taxes.

Average EU corporate tax rate 24%; 12.5% in Ireland. India and China have lower rates too.

McCain proposes to slash federal corporate tax rate to 25% along with expensing for capital investment (allowing capital costs to be deducted in the year they are incurred.)

McCain proposes to make current tax rates permanent: Top individual income-tax rate 35%; capital gains and dividends rates 15% and eliminate repetitive death tax. In addition he proposes to double the personal exemption for children and other dependents from $3,500 to $7,000.

McCain proposes to abolish the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), which was originally adopted as a mechanism to ensure that a small number of the richest Americans pay at least some tax. Because it was never indexed for inflation, today it imposes sharp, surprise tax increases on the middle class in the highest-tax states.

McCain also pledges to ban taxes on the Internet and on cell phones, consistent with his longstanding record.

These policies seem to be exactly what the economy needs. Besides eliminating the huge competitive disadvantage for American corporations internationally, these policies would spur investment. This would shore up the dollar, leaving the Fed more room to boost the economy. New and existing businesses would surge and expand hiring, producing more jobs and higher wages.

Barack Obama proposes to increase the top two individual tax rates.

Obama would increase the capital gains and dividends tax rate by 33%.

Obama has proposed Social Security payroll tax increases of 16% to 32% for families making over $250,000 a year

Obama’s proposed health plan would also impose a new payroll tax on employers.

Obama would reinstitute the "death tax" (estate tax) with a top rate of 45%.

Obama has also proposed several increases in corporate taxes, including a "windfall profits" tax on oil.

McCain proposes cutting numerous tariffs.

Obama proposes no cuts in any tariffs and several higher tariffs.

McCain favors the Columbian Free Trade Agreement

And if he raises enormous taxes otherwise as described, that will help those people how?

It's like Fred Thompson quipped in his convention address. Obama seems to think you can take water out of only one side of the bucket.
 
 
@Asherman,

 
Actually, the Democrats have controlled the Congress since the last major election, and this Congress has done virtually nothing.
 

Please. The Republicans have filibustered every single bill in the Senate. They have used the filibuster dozens of times more then any Senate in history has during a session. This makes it extremely difficult to get bills passed; 60 votes is a large amount to overcome, when you only have 50 seats in the Senate.

In the house, the Republicans have used every trick and gimmick they can in order to stall business. They call for adjournment four times a day, every day, which much be voted on each time. They use legislative tricks to get bills held up.

Bush has vetoed several bills the Congress has passed.

For you to blame the Dems for not doing anything? It betrays a pure ignorance of the actions of this Congress, of the actions of the Republicans in obstructing any votes, and just shows what an uninteresting partisan you are, Ash. You obviously have not done any real research into what actually went on in Congress. If you like, I can provide facts and figures showing just how obstructionist the Republicans have been, much, much more so then the Dem congresses of the past.

Your trickle-down economic arguments are as tired as they are trite. During the 90's, we had the sort of taxes that Obama is proposing now; and businesses weren't exactly fleeing the country.

@Foxfyre,

 
Obama would reinstitute the "death tax" (estate tax) with a top rate of 45%.

 

I make it a point not to accept such articles as fact, so I did some research and found an analysis [urlhttp://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/url.cfm?ID=411693]here[/url]. I havent read all of it, but struck on this little bit in the first few paragraphs.

 
Each candidate would also increase the estate tax exemption and reduce the estate tax rate compared with current law in 2011 and beyond, although Senator McCain would cut the tax much more than Senator Obama.
 

The Tax Policy Center is what factcheck.org uses, so I figured it should be credible. Still looking.
 
 
@Asherman,

I forgot to mention: you list off a huge amount of quibbles you have with the Dem Congress. But McCain isn't running for Congress, he's running for the Presidency, so how does he represent a change from Bush? It is inaccurate to say that the Dems have controlled Washington since the last election; the Executive branch wields far more power then the Congress under our modern system.

You should attempt to show how he is going to reform the Executive branch, if you truly want to make the case that he is going to reform Washington. I suspect you, like the other Republicans on this site and elsewhere, will be purely unable to make that case. For McCain does not represent any real change from Bush at all.

@Foxfyre,

Fox, your position only makes sense if people somehow forgot the 1990's, a time when we enjoyed the sort of taxation Obama is proposing, and yet somehow, we made much more money and had a balanced budget.

He's not raising 'enormous taxes.' He's returning many of them to the way they were 8 years ago. He's raising taxes on folks who won't even blink when they have to pay them.

And, as has been pointed out, BOTH candidates want the death tax back; I'm afraid I really can't trust the conclusions of that article, as they don't seem all that accurate.

Don't get me wrong. I don't have any major problem with the TPC or its parent organizations. But it does seem to draw on the Urban Institute for its tax analysis and that organization is headed by a whole covey of somewhat leftwing think tankers who I don't especially trust to be entirely unbiased in their analysis. Also other credible sources such as Forbes, Cato, Heritage et al often disagree with their analysis though they also sometimes agree.

The Urban Institute by the way isn't enamored with either Obama or McCain's economic policies at this time.

But at this point I'm not pushing Forbes as the real deal nor am I disputing the TPC's take on it. I do think we will be better informed if we look at what all of them are saying though.
 
 
@Foxfyre,

There are some problems with the comparison from Forbes Fox.

They compare the AVERAGE tax rate for EU to the HIGHEST rate for the US.
A proper comparison would be the actual taxes paid in both places.

The EU doesn't allow the same tax write offs as the US does so the comparison of rates is misleading and probably intentionally so unless you want to believe that Forbes doesn't know how to compare effective tax rates.

 
However, the U.S also has the greatest number of corporate tax loopholes of any OECD member,[28] allowing many corporations to achieve a lower effective tax rate than the published rates.

@parados,

I'm not sure where all that is in that huge Wikipedia article, Parados, and I am not inclined to read it all to decipher the information.

But how do you think that affects Obama or McCain's proposed economic policies?

Meanwhile I chuckled at this one too:

 
 
 
Here's Obama today, on McCain's attempt to jack his 'change' message.

 
Everywhere I go we've been talking about change, that's been the theme of the campaign. And we must be on to something, because I notice now everyone's talking about change now.

John McCain has said that change is coming!

Now think about this coming from the party that's been in charge for 8 years, they've been running the show! Been up in the White House, John McCain brags, '90% of the time I have voted with George Bush. He and I we we're right there' and suddenly he's the change agent!

He says I'm going to tell those lobbyists that their days in Washington are over. Who's he gonna tell? Is he gonna tell his campaign chairman who's one of the biggest corporate lobbyists in Washington? Is he going to tell all the folks who are running his campaign who are the biggest corporate lobbyist in Washington? Who is it that he's going to tell that change is coming?

I mean come on! They must think you're stupid!

I mean, maybe what they're saying is 'watch out George Bush' you know except for economic policies, and tax policies, and energy policies, and health care policies, and education policies, and Karl Rove style of politics " except for all that, we're really going to bring change to Washington! We're gonna shake things up! What are these guys talking about? Do you think we haven’t been paying attention over the past 8 years?

(Obama then went point by point through education, tax policy, energy policy and health care telling voters why McCain’s version of change is not change like the kind he will bring.)

I know the governor of Alaska has been, you know, saying she is change. And that is great. She is a skillful politician. But when you been taking all these earmarks when it is convenient and then suddenly you are the champion anti-earmark person. That is not change, come on. I mean, words mean something. You can't just make stuff up. You can’t just make stuff up. We have a choice to make and the choice is clear.

Don't be fooled. These are the folks who have been in charge. John McCain's party, with the help of John McCain, has been in charge.

 

You guys really do think people are stupid, don't you?

I still haven't heard anyone outline how McSame will be significantly different then Bush in the Executive branch. Only railing against Congress.

I am encouraged though at finding out more and more how little of Obama's policies many if not most of his supporters actually even know, much less understand. And I'm banking on the majority of voters in November to have done their homework. If they do, I believe McCain will win.

Now you watch, some numbnut will show up and throw out more ad hominem leftwing malarky. Wanna make a bet on that?
 
 
@Cycloptichorn,

Cyclo, The conservative's brain has already been calcified for eight years; don't expect any change in the support of McCain/Palin.

Let's look at what you actually wrote:

 
McCain proposes to slash federal corporate tax rate to 25% along with expensing for capital investment (allowing capital costs to be deducted in the year they are incurred.)

McCain proposes to make current tax rates permanent: Top individual income-tax rate 35%; capital gains and dividends rates 15% and eliminate repetitive death tax. In addition he proposes to double the personal exemption for children and other dependents from $3,500 to $7,000.

Because it was never indexed for inflation, today it imposes sharp, surprise tax increases on the middle class in the highest-tax states.

McCain also pledges to ban taxes on the Internet and on cell phones, consistent with his longstanding record.
 

Those are all Bush positions. They aren't the way things all ARE right now, but that's b/c Congress has not passed everything Bush WANTS to pass. He's been trying to get the tax cuts made permanent for years. Bush has been trying to get the corporate tax rate lowered for years. He has campaigned to abolish the AMT.

You aren't showing how McCain is different then the current bunch in the WH; if anything, you just showed how similar they are. Once again, you are positioning McCain's campaign as running against the way things are done in Congress, but he's not running for that, he's running for the Executive branch. The things you outlined do not represent a different opinion then the current bunch in the executive branch, who also want to lower taxes on businesses and the rich at every opportunity.

C'mon Fox, you can do better then this. Show what specific Bush policies McCain is against, both in terms of taxation and other things.

Additionally, the '35% corporate tax rate' is bullshit. This is before deductions and loopholes, most of which cut down business taxes to below 20% or even below 10% in many cases. And that's not counting local incentives to do business; I know in Austin, we cut taxes to the bone in order to attract businesses. You won't get far convincing people that the corporate tax rate needs to be cut, unless you are truthful about the amount they actually pay.

Cycloptichorn
 
 
@Ramafuchs,

Here is a conservative German Daily 's view

John McCain has positioned himself as the John Wayne of politics. He’ll ride out to take on Washington as an independent man with gun-toting Sarah from the frontier at his side. Or, as he puts it, “I don’t work for a party. I don’t work for special interests. I don’t work for myself. I work for you.” McCain belongs to George W. Bush’s party. He embraced him on a public stage in 2004. Will anyone buy his image as a lone gun against the big shots?

Probably. The situation is similar to Germany in 1998: Helmut Kohl had to go and if Wolfgang Schäuble and Angela Merkel had united against the red-green coalition, the CDU would have stood a chance. It might at least have been a close election. Gerhard Schroeder was O.K., but some were put off by the Greens. Barack Obama is O.K. but some are put off by a black candidate. The U.S.A. hasn’t swung to the left as Germany did after Hartz.* But Obama has steadily drifted toward the right in order to improve his election chances. That’s the situation.

In America, Bush isn’t the problem, Congress is. There, it’s popularly believed that spoilsports and partisans fight for every tiny advantage and the result is a sort of political Verdun. Nothing moves anymore. Bush’s approval rating is at 30 percent and Congress’s is at 14, the lowest ever recorded. That affects not only Republicans. Nancy Pelosi, who was praised in 2006 as the first woman Speaker of the House of Representatives, watches as her autobiography moves to the discount shelf at bookstores.

A visual comparison of the conventions is somber for McCain. Obama’s power was overwhelming. His words, like polished gems, were presented in a grandiose setting. McCain offered patriotic bricks in an unspectacular setting. He’s one up on Obama in the fact that in his 72 years he’s been militarily and politically closer to death than to life four times. The old man saddles up and rides off into America’s small towns. Barack Obama hasn’t met his match in John McCain, but he’s found a worthy opponent.

So, just to be clear, you don't think that these are opinions or platforms that are espoused by Bush? It's not a question of opinion, it's a question of the record of the current crop and the proposals of the new ones being extremely similar if not exactly the same on these issues.

Our side should not be allowed to get away with that any more than the Obama disciples should be allowed to get away with it H2O.

WHY are they not good for the country? And how is what McCain proposing good or not good for the country?

I'm not asking for an in depth economics lesson here as few, if any of us, are qualified to give one. But surely we have something more substantive to base our arguments on than we're okay and you're not.
 
 
Speaking for myself, if Obama's magnanimous tax cut for senior citizens does not include capital gains, he will be imposing a huge hardship on those seniors who depend on their retirement investments to live. We'll have to see if that flies, huh?
 
 
@Cycloptichorn,

Actually, my quibbles about Congress isn't limited to those dominated by the Democrats. The Congress is (and mostly always has been) self-serving, partisan and unable to rise to national challenges. McCain has spent a good part of his life serving in the Congress where he has a well-deserved reputation for fighting corruption, waste and self-interest regardless of which Party, or politician is involved. Obama has been absent and supportive of the Democratic Party line for the short time he has been in Congress.

A McCain-Palin administration can be expected to resist efforts to enlarge the Federal government, and the bureaucracy. The Administration will make efforts to eliminate Congressional pork and earmarks. He will veto Bills that are wasteful of the tax payer's money, and I expect sincere efforts to reduce the number of bureaucrats on the Federal payroll. The proposals the administration sends to Congress will focus on items of substance; Energy Independence, tax reform, Social Security and MediCare reforms, etc. The McCain administration will draw a line in foreign relations that will reassure our friends and serve unmistakable notice on our enemies.

I doubt that either McCain, or Obama will be able to effectuate much meaningful change, because our system is designed to prevent that. Our system evolves and changes, but very slowly. McCain and Palin have demonstrated their willingness to risk personal defeat by challenging entrenched interests. Obama has not. He risked nothing personal in organizing the poor folks in Chicago, and he has risked nothing since coming to Congress. He's spoken and written about "change" that apparently will create a modern Utopia paid for by redistributing the wealth from those who earned it to those who have not. Promises, promises.

This is what we're dealing with in a succinct nutshell. President Clinton accomplished practically zilch his first two years in Congress when he had a Democratically controlled Congress. Why? They liked the status quo and they weren't gonna mess with it. It was only the so-called Gingrich led GOP revolution of a bunch of brand new reform minded freshmen Republicans who gained control of Congress in 1994 that took us in to what almost constituted a 'new deal' in the reforms, change of how welfare was done, economic prosperity and fiscal responsibility resulting in an almost balanced budget.

McCain and Palin are likely to be saddled with an entrenched Democratic majority in both houses of Congress who have accomplished practically nothing in the last two years and aren't going to want to help the new GOP leadership accomplish any more of their goals than they absolutely have to.

But I believe John McCain when he says he doesn't care who gets the credit, and he has absolutely nothing to lose politically and nobody that he will be beholden to. I think he will absolutely be the maverick that he promises to be. And I see nothing in Sarah Palin that suggests that she marches to any drum but her own and I think McCain will use that to great advantage.

I agree with that Forbes writer. I think if the people want real change, McCain/Palin is absolutely their best bet to get it.
 
 
@Foxfyre,

Once again, you left off the biggest part of Obama's plan: that he plans on cutting income taxes for 90-95% of taxpayers. You might not agree that this will save money in the end, but if you were honest, you would include it in the plan listing!

 
Obama’s proposed health plan would also impose a new payroll tax on employers.
 

So does McCain's plan; but you don't list that.

 
Obama would reinstitute the "death tax" (estate tax) with a top rate of 45%.
 

So would McCain's plan; but you don't list that.

C'mon, Fox. I don't mind if you like McCain's plans, there's nothing wrong with that. But don't pretend it is meaningfully different then Bush's economic plans, for it isn't.

Cycloptichorn
 
 
@Foxfyre,

Ok, maybe the one I posted earlier was too long to read. Here is a side by side  comparison . I urge you to consider the fact that TPC actually cites its sources when deciding whether or not to give it credence.

The Forbes piece you posted is not a comprehensive analysis but rather an opinion piece, as evidence by how much information they left out. One example, the estate tax. He dings Obama for bringing it back when McCain would also bring it back (though with a higher exemption and lower rate). He credits McCain with wanting to abolish the AMT when he is really just proposing to extend the 2007 patch, as does Obama.
 
 
@Cycloptichorn,

I posted an article from Forbes magazine and have been discussing the points made in that article. Those aren't the ONLY points that can be made of course, but so far you have done nothing but state opinion that you haven't backed up with anything. You may be right. But without having some evidence that the information I am posting is wrong, you can surely understand that I will consider your information to more likely be flawed than that which I am posting.

McCain is on the record as favoring retaining the current progressively decreasing tax levels on estate taxes so that they do NOT revert to their pre-2001 levels in 2011 as they will do if the Bush tax cuts are not made permanent.

And on health care:

 
“John McCain believes that insurance reforms should increase the variety and affordability of insurance coverage available to American families by fostering competition and innovation.

Reform the tax code to eliminate the bias toward employer-sponsored health insurance, and provide all individuals with a $2,500 tax credit ($5,000 for families) to increase incentives for insurance coverage…

Families should be able to purchase health insurance nationwide, across state lines, to maximize their choices, and heighten competition for their business that will eliminate excess overhead, administrative, and excessive compensation costs from the system.

Allow individuals to get insurance through any organization or association that they choose: employers, individual purchases, churches, professional association, and so forth…” 2
 

Perhaps you can show where he intends to increase taxes on employers?

You've always been good at this, Ash, repeating old canards, but you do do it with a measure of assurance; good fiction writer, eh? So much of American politics, ideas on country are simply the result of a pretty effective propaganda program which you've bought into.

Your gravitas is looking pretty shoddy.

 
McCain's 'Maverick' Myth Is the Media's Creation

By David Brock and Paul Waldman, Anchor Books. Posted March 31, 2008.

The bizarre tale of how the media turned a crooked Republican into the mirage of a principled politician.

In 1992, McCain was one of three Republican senators to vote for Democratic campaign finance reform legislation (all the Senate Democrats except two voted in favor). The bill called for the provision of taxpayer funds and other incentives to urge candidates to abide by voluntary spending limits; it was vetoed by then-president George H. W. Bush, a veto that the Senate failed to override. In 1993, McCain again cast himself in the role of party rebel in the campaign finance debate. In deliberations over an identical measure to the one Bush had vetoed in 1992, McCain proposed amendments that caught the attention of the media. McCain offered one amendment that barred candidates from using campaign money for personal expenses such as vacations, mortgage payments, and clothing purchases, among others. Another amendment pushed for the campaign reforms, if enacted, to go into effect in 1994 instead of 1996, as originally proposed. Little noted was that McCain's amendment was identical to one that his Arizona colleague, Senator Dennis DeConcini (D), was set to introduce to the Senate, before McCain beat him to the punch by a day-a move that won McCain credit for the amendment.

The early returns to these maneuvers were encouraging. In 1993, the Washington Post noted that McCain was one of five "maverick" Republicans for his work on campaign finance reform legislation. Another Post reference two months later offered a continuation of the theme, describing McCain as a "conservative with maverick instincts."But if the media had taken a closer look, talk of McCain as a maverick may have been a little premature. As news stories at the time made clear, the 1992 campaign finance bill was preordained to be vetoed by Bush, making it easier for McCain and his fellow Republican rebels to back it. That motive became starker in 1993 when the Clinton administration, pushing a nearly identical bill, was told by McCain and his fellow "renegades" that they would support a Republican filibuster of the legislation.

Predictably, Clinton expressed his dismay at the "rebels" who changed their tune when faced with a bill that might actually become law. "The thing that particularly troubles me about this one is that several Republicans voted for a bill not unlike this last year which contained public financing," Clinton said. The Associated Press reported that Republican moderates admitted to voting for the original bill only because they knew it would be vetoed.

Eventually, McCain and his band of mavericks broke with their GOP colleagues on the filibuster, but only after the bill was gutted to remove most of the public financing features of the measure. The compromise legislation "left almost no one happy" and was derided by advocacy groups like Public Citizen and US PIRG as watered down. The bill eventually died a quiet death in the House. McCain's maverick gestures, though revealed to be less than substantial under scrutiny, nonetheless left their imprint on the media.
 

 
Asherman postures:
Obama has been absent and supportive of the Democratic Party line for the short time he has been in Congress.
 

Ask that top flight researcher, H2oMan, how this actually plays out.

A McCain-Palin administration can be expected to resist efforts to enlarge the Federal government, and the bureaucracy. The Administration will make efforts to eliminate Congressional pork and earmarks. He will veto Bills that are wasteful of the tax payer's money, and I expect sincere efforts to reduce the number of bureaucrats on the Federal payroll. The proposals the administration sends to Congress will focus on items of substance; Energy Independence, tax reform, Social Security and MediCare reforms, etc.
 

Pure partisan motivated drivel.

What friends? They're not all that reassured, I assure you. A quick review of the facts, something that you hold in great disdain, finds that McCain has been wrong about virtually everything wrt foreign policy. He knows nothing about life and people outside his narrow little borders.
 
 
@Foxfyre,

I agree that we should eliminate the bias toward employer sponsored health care, but it seems like the easiest way to do that is to just make all health insurance tax deductible, right? If my health insurance is no longer taken out pre-tax, but I get a $5000 tax credit, my paycheck gets smaller, I might get bumped up into a higher tax bracket -- increasing my effective tax rate, and I wont get any relief until April. I am not too crazy about that idea.
 
 
@FreeDuck,

 
Ok, maybe the one I posted earlier was too long to read. Here is a side by side  comparison . I urge you to consider the fact that TPC actually cites its sources when deciding whether or not to give it credence.

The Forbes piece you posted is not a comprehensive analysis but rather an opinion piece, as evidence by how much information they left out. One example, the estate tax. He dings Obama for bringing it back when McCain would also bring it back (though with a higher exemption and lower rate). He credits McCain with wanting to abolish the AMT when he is really just proposing to extend the 2007 patch, as does Obama.

 

Okay, I'll check it out when I get some time. You may have arrived at something. I did note this at the bottom of the analysis though:

"TPC has not verified claims made" along with citing the only sources used as Obama's website, McCain's website, and the NY Times. I think for now I'll stick with Forbes' take on it but I will look forther.

My health care is fully tax deductible because I can pay it through my own business. I also enjoy excellent coverage at a very affordable cost and don't want either Obama or McCain messing with that. A tax credit would probably put more money in my pocket though and medical savings accounts make HUGE sense. The primary difference between Obama and McCain is that Obama wants to micromanage it with more taxes and I can see nothing.....I do mean NOTHING.....good that can come from that. McCain wants to make it possible and affordable (by lower taxes) for people to be able to get the healthcare they want when and where they want it but leave it up to them how that will happen. McCain is advocating the same kinds of portability and flexibility that I have been hollering to get for years.
 
 
@Asherman,

 
Because some of your family members are Buddhist doesn't make you more knowledgeable than I am after being a Buddhist for 45 years and doing graduate work on Oriental Philosophy and Religion.
 

I don't know much at all about Buddhism but being a war monger doesn't seem to square with being a Buddhist.

Not having the common decency to voice some small measure of concern about the tens of thousands of dead Iraqis, about their ravaged country, their destroyed homes and infrastructure just doesn't seem to square with being a Buddhist.

Forbes IS a source. Where this particular writer got the data, I don't know, but I do know the value they put on the reputation of the organization and the journalistic integrity of the publication and the value they put on their journalistic and editorial integrity, and therefore I trust them. I have also listened to Steve Forbes on several occasions talking about this stuff. I think the information found in Forbes can also be backed up through other groups who study tax policy and the consequences when various kinds of policy are implemented.

What sources does Obama use? The NY Times? That the sources TPC apparently was using.  
 
 
 
Only in America Could a Two-Faced Creature Like McCain Attain Such Media Status

By Rory O'Connor, AlterNet. Posted September 5, 2008.

Only in America could a man who has called the mainstream media his "base" run against that very same media.

Is there a problem in Washington? Forget the fact that the Republicans have been running everything there for years -- and elect a Republican "change agent!" Is there a problem with the ongoing war and occupation of Iraq? Forget the fact that the Republicans have been waging a war there for years -- and elect a Republican "change agent!" Is there a problem with our media being complicit with those in power and concealing the truth from the American people? Forget the fact that the Republican candidate for president has benefited from a cozy relationship with his media "base" for years -- and yes, elect a Republican "change agent," who will then, unchanged, crawl right back into bed with that same elite, effete crowd the minute he sets foot in the Oval Office!

Only in America, Land of Opportunity, is everyone free to start over -- and over and over -- endlessly reinventing themselves. Here, as the poet Allen Ginsberg once noted, "yesterday's newspaper is amnesia."

@Asherman,

Anyone who studies any religion and professes its faith is not necessarily a good example of "that" faith. Do you understand why so many priests molested children? Probably not, but I thought I'd ask. They studied their religion too, and many had PhDs in it. Did it make them more knowledgeable or better at their religion? Same-o, you!

Yup, that's only "my" opinion.
 
 
@Foxfyre,

 
Where this particular writer got the data, I don't know,
 

That is what I am interested in finding out.

 
What sources does Obama use?
 

Uh, it is his proposal. His proposal is the source for the analysis. It is, after all, an analysis of the two proposals. Same with McCain -- TPC used his website too.

So, if I have you right, you will believe an incomplete and unsourced analysis from an opinion piece in Forbes before you will believe a comprehensive and footnoted analysis by people whose expertise is tax policy. I dont think this conversation can continue.
 
 
@FreeDuck,

You don't understand, Duck. Forbes IS a source. They do the research. They do the analysis. Other folks look to Forbes as an expert resource and quote them as an authority on economic and financial matters.

You may not like them. But they are very well respected in the business world.
 
 
@Foxfyre,

What I like has nothing to do with this. This is a question of credibility and reliability. I dont think we can possibly see eye to eye on this.
 
 
@Foxfyre,

The Tax Policy Center is a source, too. They are mostly made up of experts in tax, budget, and social policy, they have tax lawyers and accountants analysing policy proposals. Forbes uses them as a source.
 
 
@FreeDuck,

We can see eye to eye if we agree that Forbes knows more about business, economy, and taxes than the NY Times or Obama or McCain combined will ever know. Obama, for instance, said in his eloquent acceptance speech that he wants to cut capital gains taxes for small businesses. Small businesses don't PAY capital gains taxes. It's stuff like that which helps us see that he doesn't have a clue what he is talking about. He says stuff that sounds really good to the uninformed and really stupid to those who actually do know at least a little bit about it. I don't know how he got that one past his fact checkers unless they don't have a clue either.

The Forbes article graciously avoided all that to point to some--not all but some--of the components of McCain and Obama's respective plans and expressed an opinion of the differences in each and the relative merits of each. If you don't like it, fine. But PLEASE, if you wish to discredit it, don't expect me to accept really obscure stuff from Obama's website or the NY Times as credible rebuttal.
 
 
@Foxfyre,

 
But PLEASE, if you wish to discredit it, don't expect me to accept really obscure stuff from Obama's website or the NY Times as credible rebuttal.
 

You do have a point there. I think the TPC is a very credible source. As I said in the last post, Forbes is using them as a source for their articles. Example:

 
Democrats are in the process of figuring out a way to eliminate the AMT altogether, but that day could be a long way off. Last year, 3.5 million people paid the AMT. If Congress hadn't acted, it would have affected 23.4 million Americans, according to the Tax Policy Center. On average, each affected return would have been hit with about $2,000 in alternative minimum tax.

@old europe,

Forbes probably does use them as a source for some data rather than having to re-invent the wheel. So do I. But apparently TPC and Forbes hold differences of opinion on this particular issue and therefore I doubt seriously Forbes used TPC as a source where TPC clearly states that their source was the candidates' website and the NY Times and they had not verified ANY of the facts stated. So now really....

As for the AMT, that was an initiative the REPUBLICANS pushed in Congress but it required the Democrats to get it through since they are the majority. They didn't want to because they wanted George Bush to take the hit--I know because I watched some of that debate--but in the end they didn't want to get blamed for their constituents taking a huge hit in an election year.

AMT is something entirely different thant the capital gains tax too though.
 
 
Forbes is probably wrong in saying that Obama's tax cuts will harm our economy. Bush also promised that his tax cuts would create jobs; where is it? Bush's job creation is the worst since Hoover, and Bush cut taxes. Where are the jobs? How does tax increases for the wealthy hurt our economy? Under Obama's plan, 95% will see a tax cut, and only those earning $250,000 plus will see a tax increase. Our government continues to increase the deficit, and transfer this to our children and grandchildren; is this good or justified? Why is paying for what we buy a bad idea? I want Forbes to answer this question?
 
 
@Foxfyre,

 
But apparently TPC and Forbes hold differences of opinion on this particular issue and therefore I doubt seriously Forbes used TPC as a source where TPC clearly states that their source was the candidates' website
 

I don't think the TPC publishes opinions. The TPC analyses the candidates' proposals, which they obviously have to get from the candidates. Hence the listing of the respective websites as sources.

 
and the NY Times and they had not verified ANY of the facts stated. So now really....
 

They haven't verified what?
 
 
@Foxfyre,

 
AMT is something entirely different thant the capital gains tax too though.
 

I know. I wasn't specifically trying to bring up the AMT, but rather trying to give an example of Forbes using the TPC as a source.

I'm not even saying the Forbes analysis was right or wrong. I'm just saying that I consider the TPC a reliable source, and so do numerous other publications. FactCheck.org relies on them. Forbes quotes them.

But I'm guessing you don't like the Urban Institute, and regard the TPC as suspect, because it's a joint venture between them and the Brookings Institution, right?
 
 
@old europe,

OE, do try to keep up here. Follow Freeduck's link to the page she took her stuff off the TPC website and see what it says at the bottom. It clearly states that the TPC had not verified any of the information printed on that page; they simply stated where they got it. And they got it from McCain and Obama's websites and the NY Times. Nowhere else. They didn't research it. They didn't analyze it. They printed it. End of story.
 
 
@old europe,

Maybe there is something in that Forbes piece citing TPC as a source, but I didn't see it. And I'm not going to get into one of your dodge and weave Q&A's where you keep changing the question when you don't get answers you want. I do hope you will understand.

I expect you to accept an analysis from the Tax Policy Center, a non-partisan think tank with a good enough reputation to be used by Factcheck.org, and who cites its sources so that it can be verified by anyone wishing to do so.

As I said FD, I use TPC and I use Factcheck. If you want to make those two groups your only bible for economics and tax policy, that is your prerogative, but I choose to depend on a quite a bit larger base than that. I trust Forbes to do competent research more than I depend on either Factcheck or TPC for reasons I have already stated and I generally look for additional sources to collaborate Forbes as well. I recommend that for any who want to deal in facts rather than mere propaganda.

@Foxfyre,

Thats not what that means. They are saying they have not verified the claims that Obama, McCain, and the NYT are making -- they are assuming that they are actually proposing what they say they are proposing. They created a side by side comparison based on the claims made by each campaign. The campaigns did not give them the comparison chart to print. There is also an analysis that I posted before the comparison.

Yes, I found it. It's the second link in the above post. I edited that post.

This seems to be a side-by-side comparison of the tax plans, as proposed by the candidates. It's not even an analysis about whether or not those goals would be achievable. Much less are they voicing an opinion.

Just comparing the candidates' proposals.

I don't understand why you take issue with that.

And since the TPC piece goes back to last June and was to be updated as more information 'became available' I have to presume that Forbes is far more current than TPC as well as being a credible source for this kind of information.
 
 
@old europe,

Right. And the whole reason I posted it was to show where the Forbes article left things out -- giving McCain props for doing something that Obama also proposes (but not saying so) and dinging Obama for things McCain also proposes. Thats all. A sane person might wonder why it took two pages of posts to get Foxfyre to accept it as evidence, if she ever does.

I am (was) only trying to get you to accept it as a valid source, and in doing so, I admit to a fair amount of exasperation myself. How do you expect to discuss the merits of these two plans when you will not accept credible sources as evidence?
 
 
@Foxfyre,

I discredited Forbes. FYI, economics is not science; it's an art. There is no formula that will provide answers to any economy - present or future. What Forbes provides is an opinion; that's all, and I say he's wrong, because what happened with Bush's tax cuts never created jobs. Forbes' assumption that the wealthy will invest more in the economy if they save on taxes is a bunch of BS. People invest when there is potential for profit, and investments by itself does not create jobs or profit.
 
 
@cicerone imposter,

One thing I've noted about you Cicero over the years is that you are fast to pass judgment, and are intolerant of any opinion that doesn't exactly match your own. You claim that I'm not a "good example" of Buddhism, but that is apparently because you in your infinite wisdom have decided that "good Buddhists" shouldn't be Conservatives, or Republicans, or support the national leadership.

You might be more credible if you could rise beyond invective and narrow prejudices.
 
 
Forbes doesn't mention critical parts of either candidates plan, in an attempt to make McCain's plan look more palatable then Obama's. It is an opinion piece, one which carefully selects facts to fit a conclusion. And there's nothing wrong with that. But to cite it as an impartial look at the two candidate's plans? Hardly.

You seemed to be saying that the Forbes piece was moot and we should pay attention to your (better) source, and you seemed to be returning to that theme every time I attempted to focus on the content. And no way do I think your source is better than Forbes nor do I think whoever posted that side by side comparison would attempt to claim that their information was more accurate than Forbes. I apologize if I misunderstood.

There's a 45-page, well-sourced PDF file to be found at the link which analyses the actual proposals.

Yes and I commented on that in an earlier post re the parent organizations - the other is the Brookings Institute--and why I am reluctant to use the Urban Institute as a sole source either. I do frequently compare the Urban/Brookings data side by side with Cato/Forbes/Heritage et al when it is possible to do so and have noted striking differences in their conclusions. Certainly these groups do not all agree on the effect of tax policy.

Who do you believe in such cases?

Obama has proved in no uncertain terms that he is only parroting sound bites that are being fed to him re economic policy and that he doesn't fully understand much of it.

McCain has had some ideas in the past with which I took strong exception, but I think if you take each suggestion each man has laid out there--one by one and not as a whole group--and explore what they mean, the more reasonable concept does become much more clear even if we can't all be experts in tax policy and economics.

Let's have a look at the self-described missions of those institutions, shall we?

 
Our Mission

The Urban Institute gathers data, conducts research, evaluates programs, offers technical assistance overseas, and educates Americans on social and economic issues " to foster sound public policy and effective government.

Our Commitments

* Use rigorous, state-of-the-art methods to analyze public policies and programs
* Bring sound objective evidence to public policy decisions
* Deepen public understanding of policy issues
* Save government and communities time and money through research on effective and efficient programs
* Work to make our Washington, D.C., metropolitan area a stronger community
 

 
The Brookings Institution is a nonprofit public policy organization based in Washington, DC. Our mission is to conduct high-quality, independent research and, based on that research, to provide innovative, practical recommendations that advance three broad goals:

* Strengthen American democracy;
* Foster the economic and social welfare, security and opportunity of all Americans and
* Secure a more open, safe, prosperous and cooperative international system.
 

 
Cato's Mission

The mission of the Cato Institute is to increase the understanding of public policies based on the principles of limited government, free markets, individual liberty, and peace. The Institute will use the most effective means to originate, advocate, promote, and disseminate applicable policy proposals that create free, open, and civil societies in the United States and throughout the world.
 

 
Our Mission

Founded in 1973, The Heritage Foundation is a research and educational institute - a think tank - whose mission is to formulate and promote conservative public policies based on the principles of free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values, and a strong national defense.
 

I'd say that a think tank that describes itself as promoting conservative or libertarian policies and values will arrive at different conclusions than an institution that doesn't seek to propagate specific ideas.
 
 
@old europe,

Think what you will. I go by what I see the groups doing, publishing, presenting, and the degree of impartiality built into it. I have frequently seen both Cato and Heritage being extremely critical of the GOP, the Republican President, and policies/activities they represent. I have NEVER seen the Urban Institute take on a liberal concept with more than the mildest criticism and even then it was preferable to the conservative alternative. That is probably explained that the President was an LBJ and Carter darling and the staff is stacked with Democrats.

But again, you seem to be dealing with credentials rather than the content of the discussion. You are certainly welcome to prefer your sources to the sources I trust more. But sooner or later, can't we get to comparing the actual tax and economic policies? Please?
 
 
@Foxfyre,

IMO, Brookings does do a better job than the Urban Institute by the way.
 
 
@Foxfyre,

Okay.

Now let's say that an equal cross the board tax rate cut nets the following:
A $100,000 refund to the guy who paid $1 million in taxes.
A $1,000 refund to the guy who paid $10,000 in taxes.
A $500 refund to the guy who paid $5,000 in taxes.
A $5 refund to the guy who paid $50 in taxes.
No refund to anybody who paid no taxes.

Obama says this isn't fair, and the principle must be fairness separate from whatever effects such a tax rate reduction does to the economy.

McCain says that the tax code should be structured to maximize economic growth, create jobs, and leave more money in the hands of the wage earners who drive the economy. He is concerned that the policy be done responsibly and without increasing the National Debt, but he doesn't care if somebody who has paid more in gets more back.

Who is right?
 
 
@Foxfyre,

 
Speaking for myself, if Obama's magnanimous tax cut for senior citizens does not include capital gains, he will be imposing a huge hardship on those seniors who depend on their retirement investments to live. We'll have to see if that flies, huh?
 

Long term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than normal income. They will pay less with or without a tax cut.
 
 
@Foxfyre,

Just about every evaluation of the two tax policies says McCain increases the national debt more than the Obama policy does.
 
 
@Foxfyre,

Wrong comparison.

The question is who should pay more for the security of their assets? The rich or the poor? Does the rich pay more for insurance because of their assets; their yachts, airplanes, and mansions? Who protects those assets? Guess? It's the government. The wealthy probably has many multiples of value in assets than the middle class or the poor. When the banks and mortgage companies goes bankrupt, who's there to bail them out? Who do you think has more invested in those banks and investment companies?

When we talk about "security" for our country, who has more to lose if we are invaded? The average home owner with about $250,000 equity in their home, or the wealthy who has seven homes?

What has equal ratio of taxes on income have to do with anything? Do you understand anything about the US tax codes?

Somebody drawing a small social security check supplemented by modest income from their 401K or IRA needs all the advantage they can get however. They are helping us all by saving to support themselves and not be on the public dole, and they should not be punished for it with higher taxes.
 
 
@Foxfyre,

 
Think what you will. I go by what I see the groups doing, publishing, presenting, and the degree of impartiality built into it.
 

That's the point though, isn't it? Cato isn't even claiming to be impartial - it's claiming to promote libertarian ideas. Heritage isn't claiming to be impartial - it's claiming to propagate conservative ideas.

Likewise, Policy Studies or the Center for American Progress aren't claiming to be impartial, but rather propagating a liberal point of view.

 
I have frequently seen both Cato and Heritage being extremely critical of the GOP, the Republican President, and policies/activities they represent.
 

Sure. In that case, they probably didn't perceive the GOP or the administration as libertarian or conservative enough.

 
But again, you seem to be dealing with credentials rather than the content of the discussion.
 

Uhm.... I think you steered the discussion in that direction by disputing the TPC as a reliable source. But alright, you've said that you're fine with the TPC, or FactCheck.org, so that's all cleared up now.
 
 
John McCain, the maverick that never was. Another American myth dissolves.

 
Palin and McCain’s Shotgun Marriage

Frank Rich

SARAH PALIN makes John McCain look even older than he is. And he seemed more than willing to play that part on Thursday night. By the time he slogged through his nearly 50-minute acceptance speech " longer even than Barack Obama’s " you half-expected some brazen younger Republican (Mitt Romney, perhaps?) to dash onstage to give him a gold watch and the bum’s rush.

The only problem, of course, is that the entire thing was a sham.

As is nakedly evident, the speech’s central argument, that the 72-year-old McCain will magically morph into a powerful change agent as president, is a non sequitur. In his 26 years in Washington, most of it with a Republican in the White House and roughly half of it with Republicans in charge of Congress, he was better at lecturing his party about reform than leading a reform movement. G.O.P. corruption and governmental dysfunction only grew. So did his cynical flip-flops on the most destructive policies of the president who remained nameless Thursday night. (In the G.O.P., Bush love is now the second most popular love that dare not speak its name.)

Even more fraudulent, if that’s possible, is the contrast between McCain’s platonic presentation of his personal code of honor and the man he has become. He always puts his country first, he told us: “I’ve been called a maverick.” If there was any doubt that that McCain has fled, confirmation arrived with his last-minute embrace of Sarah Palin.

...

He wanted to choose the pro-abortion-rights Joe Lieberman as his vice president. If he were still a true maverick, he would have done so. But instead he chose partisanship and politics over country. “God only made one John McCain, and he is his own man,” said the shafted Lieberman in his own tedious convention speech last week. What a pathetic dupe. McCain is now the man of James Dobson and Tony Perkins. The “no surrender” warrior surrendered to the agents of intolerance not just by dumping his pal for Palin but by moving so far to the right on abortion that even Cindy McCain seemed unaware of his radical shift when being interviewed by Katie Couric last week.

 http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/07/opinion/07rich.html?ref=opinion 

 
 
 
A couple more important paragraphs.

 
“Often my haste is a mistake,” McCain conceded in his 2002 memoir, “but I live with the consequences without complaint.” Well, maybe it’s fine if he wants to live with the consequences, but what about his country? Should the unexamined Palin prove unfit to serve at the pinnacle of American power, it will be too late for the rest of us to complain.

We’ve already seen where such visceral decision-making by McCain can lead. In October 2001, he speculated that Saddam Hussein might have been behind the anthrax attacks in America. That same month he out-Cheneyed Cheney in his repeated public insistence that Iraq had a role in 9/11 " even after both American and foreign intelligence services found that unlikely. He was similarly rash in his reading of the supposed evidence of Saddam’s W.M.D. and in his estimate of the number of troops needed to occupy Iraq. (McCain told MSNBC in late 2001 that we could do with fewer than 100,000.) It wasn’t until months after “Mission Accomplished” that he called for more American forces to be tossed into the bloodbath. The whole fiasco might have been prevented had he listened to those like Gen. Eric Shinseki who faulted the Rumsfeld war plan from the start.

Many Obama touts suggest Obama will cut taxes for 90% of the public.

Obama has never introduced a bill that became law.

Obama has never been able to reach accross party line to effect legislation.

Obama therefore can not be trusted to have this Congress pass any budget bill he suggests.
 
 
@Woiyo9,

Woiyo, do you believe the idiotic things you are saying?

The Lugar-Obama non-proliferation act, which Obama introduced with a Republican, was signed into law.

Your rants would be funny if they weren't so stupid.
 
 
@Gelisgesti,

Wow. Does that sound like anybody you know?
 
 
Okay, it seems nobody want to deal with the side by side tax policy comparisons just yet. How about health care?

Here's Cato's summarized analysis.
Does anybody have another from a credible source that would rebut this?
Or what of each candidate's plans do you like or dislike most?

 
Healthcare reform will be one of the top issues of the 2008 presidential election. In the face of widespread public demand for changes in the U.S. health care system, both Barack Obama and John McCain have offered detailed proposals for reform.

Senator Obama's approach relies heavily on government mandates, regulations, and subsidies. He would mandate that employers provide health care coverage for their workers and that parents purchase health insurance for their children. He would significantly increase regulation of the insurance industry, establishing a standard minimum benefits package, and requiring insurers to accept all applicants regardless of their health. He would offer a variety of new and expanded subsidies to middle- and low-income Americans.

In contrast, John McCain emphasizes consumer choice and greater competition in the health care industry. He would move away from our current employment-based insurance system by replacing the current tax exclusion for employer-provided insurance with a refundable tax credit for individuals. At the same time he would sharply deregulate the insurance industry to increase competition.

Senator McCain's proposal is far from perfect, but from a free-market perspective, it appears superior to Senator Obama's plan. Obama's plan, with its heavy reliance on government, leads to the same problems that bedevil universal health care systems all over the world: limited patient choices and rationed care. McCain's proposal is much more consumer centered and taps into the best aspects of the free market. (--Michael Tanner)

@Foxfyre,

Yeah, sharp deregulation of industry, gosh, that's always been shown to lower prices.

 

There's a reason why Cato is not a trusted source, except by partisan Republicans. They don't seem to a firm historical grasp of the effects of actions.

@Cycloptichorn,

Any other comments on the details themselves Cyclop? Cato is not Republican at all, and is perhaps one of the strongest authoritative critics of our current President and Republican party policies these days.

But if you don't like Cato's comparison, by all means post your own credible source with a different side by side comparison.

And okay you are opposed to deregulation of the health insurance industry. Please explain why.
 
 
@JTT,

JTT, It's part and parcel of the McCain rhetoric that doesn't jive with his actions. He said he'll bring both parties together to work together, but he picks as his running mate a pit bull conservative who believes in the extreme, fundamentalist religious issues of right to life (over freedom of choice), our task commanded by god to have our war in Iraq (same as Bush), stop stem cell research, and censure books in our libraries.

What kind of cooperation and compromise is McCain trying to sell to the American People?

I thought I made it clear above: deregulation of any industry has never been shown to lower prices. Deregulation of college tuition has lead to giant explosions in the cost of tuition. Why would deregulation lower prices? Why would less oversight of the industry lead to what will amount to lower profits for the industry? It is not at all clear why it will. The regulations are there for a reason; to cavalierly throw them out the window in an attempt to lower prices, which is far from guaranteed, is folly.

Cato attacks Bush, but only when he's too liberal; only when he spends too much money for them. They never attack him for the failure of right-wing economics, for that is who they support. The idea that Cato is somehow 'neutral' is a joke.

Cycloptichorn
 
 
@Foxfyre,

 
How about health care?
 

Sure.

 
We conclude that the McCain plan, which would replace the current exclusion for employer-paid premiums with a refundable income tax credit of up to $5000 for anyone purchasing of health insurance and make other changes to the healthcare system, would increase the deficit by $1.3 trillion over 10 years and modestly trim the number of uninsured. The Obama plan, which would make relatively low-cost insurance available to everyone through non-group pools and subsidize premiums for low- and moderate-income households, would cost $1.6 trillion, but would also cover virtually all children and many currently uninsured adults.

TPC projects the McCain plan would trim the uninsured by 1 million in 2009 and nearly 5 million by 2013, although their numbers would slowly rise thereafter because the tax credit would fail to keep pace with premiums (see figure). Obama would reduce the uninsured by 18 million in 2009 and 34 million by 2018. Even under the Obama plan, however, 34 million Americans would still lack insurance in 2018.

 

The new TPC analysis updates earlier sets of estimates released in June and July 2008. The revised estimates reflect changes in each candidate’s plans, additional details released by the campaigns (particularly that by the Obama campaign on August 14, 2008), and modifications to our tax modeling procedures.

Well if you won't accept any site that doesn't denounce every Republican or conservative policy, we can just agree not to discuss this with each other at all because whether you want to admit it or not, the Republicans every now and then do get it right and conservatism has produces better results. Or, please post your credible site that rebuts Cato's take on it. Or give me a reasoned argument for why Cato is wrong.

I will agree that deregulation has not produced the best results in some cases, but what data do you have to show that " deregulation of any industry has never been shown to lower prices." Are you sure you want to stick with that statement? There are quite a few sources out there that agree with Cato that deregulating the insurance industry would bring prices down. Do you have one that explains why their take on it is wrong?
 
 
@old europe,

Please explain how the TPC data addresses the Cato data OE. The data your posted is way too vague for me to agree that it is a side by side comparisons with Cato's analysis. We all seem to agree that TPC is taking Obama's side, but then TPC almost always takes the liberal side in their analysis. They are a credible site. But I'm going to need some serious collaboration supporting their conclusions to believe they have it right.

Cato isn't necessarily wrong. They are just libertarian. Which means that they will propagate a libertarian point of view, rather than just analysing the data and presenting the results.

They have a libertarian agenda, and there's nothing wrong with that, because they openly say so themselves. They promote libertarian policies.

But the Tax Policy Center, an arm of the Urban Institute which, to be best of my knowledge, has never advocated or supported a clearly Republican or conservative issue in their history is more objective and and has no ideological influence in their assessments?

And yet I use data from all of these because their respective bias does not necessarily rule their data invalid. It helps to be aware of the bias, however, and collaborate the data with other sources before accepting any of it as the gosepl truth. (There are sites that have proved themselves to be so blatantly dishonest that I accept NOTHING from them as intentionally credible, but I do not inlcude UI or TPC among those.)

So now. If we can set aside the sources themselves for a moment, I will ask you to address the previous question(s).

The fact that they don't support "a clearly Republican or conservative issue" doesn't mean they aren't centrist. If they wouldn't advocate Republican ideas, but support Democratic ideas - that would probably make them a liberal institution.

As far as I can see in their analysis, they don't voice any opinion at all. Unlike the Cato Institute, which, true to their stated mission (and, again, I don't criticise them for that), argues that "from a free-market perspective, it appears superior to Senator Obama's plan".

That is voicing an opinion, and it's voicing an opinion from a libertarian point of view.

If you can find something similar in the TPC's analysis, I'll turn around and agree with you that the TPC is promoting specific policies rather than merely analysing the data.

Good. I'm not arguing against using an article or an analysis from the Cato Institute, by the way. I'm just arguing that an analysis from Cato will evaluate the data from a libertarian perspective - mostly because that is their stated mission.

I'd love to. What questions specifically?
 
 
@Foxfyre,

I think that there is no reason to dispute Catos take that McCains plan is better from a free market perspective. However, for me, free market is not the measure. The question is what are we hoping to do with these health plans. What I would like to see is more people covered, more affordable health insurance, reduce the numbers of people who need to file bankruptcy due to health care costs, and break away from the bias toward employer sponsored health care. If a free market solution could accomplish these, that would be fine. But I see health care as something similar to public education.

I mentioned earlier that the easiest way to eliminate the employer sponsored bias is to just make all health insurance premiums tax deductible, period. McCains tax credit would do less and less good as premium costs rise, making it more of a burden on families who no longer get the premiums taken out pre-tax. Obamas plan covers more people and lowers costs. To me that is better. Not perfect, but better. Yes, it costs more than McCains, but not by much compared with the added benefit.

My concern is that Obama is leading us into another enormous costly and almost certainly problematic inefficient govenrment entitlement program.

Also, other than in very narrowly defined areas necessary for national administration, my libertarian soul strongly resists Big Brother mandates requiring people to acquire something they don't want or need. Most liberals want people to have the right to die if that is what they choose. But I can choose to die but I can't choose not to have health insurance?

And Obama's plan to make it impossible for insurance company's to reject a healthcare application even if an adult decides to wait until he or she NEEDS insurance for some terrible expensive malady is just insane. I think there is a real possibility that every private insurance company in America will be bankrupted inside of a year or will close down their healthcare lines. And then everybody is dependent on the government and whatever it chooses to allow us to have.

I am never opposed to the government spending less and allowing the people to keep more of their own money. And, from my point of view, a tax credit accomplishes that far more efficiently than does a tax deduction. I believe the free market system produces the most choices, the best quality, and the most affordable prices in the long run.

I go back to the fact that health insurance in America was readily available, affordable, and excellent up to the 1960's when the government began taking over large portions of it. It was then that the prices started spiraling out of control and most of our current problems developed. Was government involvement the reason for most of that? I don't know, but there sure is a strong correlation? Stuff the government has kept its nose mostly out of has become mostly better and more affordable with new technological innovations.

I dont like mandates either and think a single payer system would be better in that regard, though I dont trust our government to do that well. However, you do know that the mandate in Obamas program is only for parents to buy health insurance for their children. If you dont want insurance you would not be required to buy it.

I dont agree unless the tax credit is indexed to current prices. I think in the case of healthcare, an absolutely free market would produce the most choices and the best quality for those who could afford it. I do not believe it would provide the most affordable prices.

Interesting. Do you have some numbers from the 60s so I can take a look? Specifically, I am interested in how many people actually had health insurance and how much it covered.

That's right. But under Obama's plan you could opt to not buy it until you needed it, and at the point that you needed it, the insurance companies would not be allowed to turn you down. Anybody who knows anything about the principle behind insurance can see how nuts that is.

Well that is something we can debate for sure. I believe that a free market with plenty of healthy competition has been pretty consistent in being favorable for the consumer.

In the 1960's most insurance policies had a pretty substantial, but not prohibitive up front deductible. And most, maybe all, didn't cover routine doctor visits, checkups, routine shots, the basic charge for an emergency room visits. But a routine doctor's visit was about $5 as was a PT shot. A visit to the ER was maybe $25 and you could pay that out if you needed as well as pay out your hospital stay if you didn't have cash in the bank. Thus folks didn't HAVE to have insurance in order to afford basic routine health care. Those who had serious uncovered expenses were in more touble, but again the hospitals worked with folks to help them find a way to pay their bills and also churches and local charities almost always kicked in to help those in need. (Yes, I was working for hospitals and/or churches and/or local charities intermittently during the 1960's and 70's)

In the mid-1960's, Hubby had just changed jobs and was in a 30-day waiting period for his new hospitalization plan to kick in when he blew his hand up in our furnace producing 3rd degree burns. The ER charge, treating, bandaging, Demerol shot, overnight admission to the hospital, and follow up cost $50. That was money to us in those days but it was not devastating for sure. What would it be now? $5,000? $10,000?

I didn't read the whole thing, but the paper Walter posted seems to contain some good information. One thing that I appreciated that it pointed out is that healthcare insurance is only one cog in the machine and there are many many other factors involved.

Doubt it all you want. I worked in the industry and utilized the industry back then. And because I handled credit and customer relations for one of those hospitals I worked for, I saw the bills that went to insurance companies and the bills printed out for people who did not have insurance and helped them come up with a plan to pay off their bills--sometimes as little as $10/month if that is all they could afford. I also helped hook them up with social services for additional help. For most, not having insurance was not the end of the world nor was it necessary to get most healthcare.

And I was still there at the time that Medicare when into effect. And I saw how things began to change almost immediately.

I based my opinion on the content of that article on the summary paragraphs showing that many if not most of the same problems that were in place in the 1960's are still there now. The main difference I see now is that the problems are far more difficult for people now.

I'm not sure if that's true for the quality of health care, but the fact that health care in the United States - without the existance of a universal health care system, without mandates or socialized health care - is the most expensive system in the world:

 

So even in comparison with a completely nationalized system like the British NHS, the free market approach in the United States doesn't seem to have brought down the cost of health care.
 
 
@old europe,

That isn't the issue here though OE. The issue is whether Obama's or McCain's plan is more likely to make things better. So again I refer you to the original question(s).

You see pointing out the sins of the present administration or Republicans or Democrats is not useful in coming up with solutions, but carping on such sins seems to be all that some wish to do. Which tells me they are operating from purely meanspirited partisan ideology and there is no real interest to do the hard mental work of determining what is the best course of action now no matter who is proposing it.
 
 
@Foxfyre,

 
That isn't the issue here though OE.
 

The cost of health care, especially in comparison with other mandatory or socialized health care systems, isn't the issue?

Okay.

It could certainly be part of the rationale for the argument. But tell me how Obama's plan will achieve lower costs or how McCain's plan won't or vice versa. Don't tell me that socialized medicine is preferable to free market as if that is a solution. Rather take your data into Obama and McCain's plans and show how it applies to either and how that affects the plausibility of either.

I have provided my observation/rationale for how the socialized medicine we now have sure hasn't produced lower costs. Why should we think that increasing that socialized medicine will produce lower costs?

Ah, you added something to your post. Okay.

Nonsense. I'm bringing up the current situation, because it allows to compare the American system with a system like the British one, where everything health care is state run, or with a system like the Swiss one, where everything health care is privately run, albeit as a statutory system.

There's a lot of material out there for comparison, to evaluate the claims whether going more free-market or going more socialized would have certain effects.

This has nothing to do with Democrats or Republicans.

 
Which tells me they are operating from purely meanspirited partisan ideology and there is no real interest to do the hard mental work of determining what is the best course of action now no matter who is proposing it.
 

Nonsense. I have criticized Obama's plan in the past on the long-running universal health care thread, and I'm still sceptical whether or not a voluntary system would have a significant effect towards making health care universal.

You're blinded by your own partisanship.

@Foxfyre,

 
Doubt it all you want. I worked in the industry and utilized the industry back then. And because I handled credit and customer relations for one of those hospitals I worked for, I saw the bills that went to insurance companies and the bills printed out for people who did not have insurance and helped them come up with a plan to pay off their bills--sometimes as little as $10/month if that is all they could afford. I also helped hook them up with social services for additional help. For most, not having insurance was not the end of the world nor was it necessary to get most healthcare.
 

I didn't (at least: I didn't want to do so) refer to your own and personal experience but just and only to the paper I quoted.

ASnd after re-reading it I still think that it doesn't back what you said, namely "the fact that health insurance in America was readily available, affordable, and excellent up to the 1960's".

I agree this has nothing to do with Democrats or Republicans and, as you indicated, the issue of socialized versus private healthcare is being thoroughly debated on other threads. What I want to do here is determine whether Obama or McCain's healthcare plan has the most promise to produce the best possible results or at least do the least harm. I don't think that is an unreasonable concept to look at.

@Foxfyre,

 
It could certainly be part of the rationale for the argument. But tell me how Obama's plan will achieve lower costs or how McCain's plan won't or vice versa.
 

I think that Obama's plan does indeed have the potential to lower the cost of health insurance, simply by virtue of regulating the market. This is the same approach Mitt Romney has taken in embarking on a transformation of the health care system in Massachusetts into a universal health care system.

(Can discuss that in more detail, if you want to.)

 
Don't tell me that socialized medicine is preferable to free market as if that is a solution.
 

I'm not. In fact, in the specific case of the health care system in the United States, I'm actually against a socialized system.

Generally, I would say that socialized systems and mandatory private systems can perform about equally well. (Can discuss that in more detail, if you want to.) However, I don't think that Americans, in general, would be too willing to go along with a socialized system.

None of that is pertinent to Obama's plan, though, as it doesn't even try to socialize the health care system.

It's true that the plan includes expanding some government services. I'm not sure that's a good way of working towards a universal health care system. In fact, when comparing the American system (that leaves millions of people uninsured) to other universal systems, it's quite astonishing how much of the system has already been socialized.

 
Rather take your data into Obama and McCain's plans and show how it applies to either and how that affects the plausibility of either.
 

That's a bit broad. What aspects of the respective plans specifically? Are we talking about the plausibility of achieving a universal health care system in the United States, based upon the proposals by the candidates?
 
 
@old europe,

Again I go back to my original questions OE. But yes, tell me how government regulation will improve the situation. We have MASSIVE regulation with Medicare and Medicade and frankly sir, I'm not seeing any improvement in the costs of healthcare.

I wasn't in that end of the business when Medicade joined it, but I'm pretty sure the effect was the same.

And yes, there is a lot of material out there. I hope we will explore it thoroughly which is what I invited you to do.
 

Sure. There's been a lengthy debate about this on various threads, but it would be interesting to discuss the data in the light of the plans that Obama and McCain have proposed.

Yeah. I didn't do that either. I was specifically answering one statement that you made, by bringing up relevant data to test your hypothesis against real-world data.

Check.

I hear you. By government regulation, I don't mean "having the government run things", though.

Government regulation can include a mandate for every citizen to buy health insurance. Government regulation can include a mandate for health insurers to insure every citizen, pre-existing conditions nonwithstanding. Government regulation can include limiting malpractice lawsuits.

There's a whole range of things the government can do to regulate the health care market and, ideally, bring down the cost of health care.

(There are examples from other countries, if you want to test against real-world scenarios.)

 
I did personally see an immediate upturn in healthcare costs when Medicare when into effect. I wasn't in that end of the business when Medicade joined it, but I'm pretty sure the effect was the same.
 

I'm not disputing that.
 
 
@old europe,

Setting aside my reluctance to give up some freedom and personal choices...

You hit on a major quarrel I have with Obama's plan here - NOT mandating that everybody buy insurance WHILE mandating that insurance companies accept all applicants. Couple that with some government furnished programs and I can think of no better system to ensure that the government will be running it all within a very short time. (I wish I could shake the real fear that having the government run it all is the ultimate goal.)
 
 
@Foxfyre,

 
You hit on a major quarrel I have with Obama's plan here - NOT mandating that everybody buy insurance WHILE mandating that insurance companies accept all applicants.
 

That's the problem I have with Obama's plan as well. I'd assume that there would be a big enough number of people who would want to get insurance (and can't, at the moment) to offset the negative effects of people who need health insurance and are declined by health insurers.

However, by making health insurance mandatory, you would virtually assure that the pool of payers would be large enough to offset the effects of insuring people with pre-existing conditions.

On the other hand, I don't see the mandate to insure people in spite of illness or pre-existing conditions as devastating for insurers.

I prefer it over McCain's plan to institute a government-run(!!!) high-risk pool, which would cover only 5-7 million people, but would cost the government $7-10 billion a year.

 
Couple that with some government furnished programs and I can think of no better system to ensure that the government will be running it all within a very short time.
 

What government-furnished programs are we talking about, specifically?

 
(I wish I could shake the real fear that having the government run it all is the ultimate goal.)
 

Noted, but I don't see that. I see a commitment on the side of Obama's plan to work towards a universal health care system - albeit with an approach that seems to come with some downsides. Even if the voluntary system works, it would never guarantee that everybody gets insured.

On the other hand, I don't see even as much as the pretense to get everybody insured in McCain's health care plan. At the core of his plan, there's a massive incentive to shift health spending away from an employer based system. I'm not sure that this would be beneficial to a large number of citizens.
 
 
@old europe,

Re what government program specifically: The government programs currently in existance are Medicare, Medicade, and VA and neither candidate suggests eliminating these. Each provides some good benefits to a segment of society and each comes equipped with its own negatives and bureaucratic nightmares. Neither candidate suggests eliminating them so presumably the intention is to leave them in place.

Does McCain's "pool" include government funding? I haven't picked up on that. I think what he has in mind is similar to a program New Mexico started a few years ago. Some small NM businesses had such abysmal claims records or presented such high risk that they became essentially uninsurable. As they are required to have workers compensation insurance in order to do business, the insurance companies licensed to write coverage in New Mexico were obligated to insure them, but, in order to make that fair and equitable, the bad risks all went into an assigned risk pool and were allocated evenly among the various insurance companies. The companies were also allowed to charge substantially higher premiums to the assigned risks they were required to take.

That helped spread the risk among the insurance companies but not sufficiently to keep the premiums from rising to prohibitive levels. So...the state got together with private investors, mostly those in the insurance industry, and put together New Mexico Mutual that would accept the bad risks, but created so much larger pool that they were able to keep premiums lower. The private insurance companies were no longer required to accept the bad risks which was just fine with them. NM Mutual premiums continue to be somewhat higher than private insurance premiums, but are not prohibitively so, and everybody has access to insurance. The program has been so successful that NM Mutual now offers others formers of business insurance in addition to work comp. Even good risks can sign up with NM Mutual if they want, but most go for the lower rates offered by private insurance companies.

What is important here that the state took the initiative to create the pool, but the state does not fund it with tax dollars nor does the state own New Mexico Mutual. The company pays for itself.

That is what I think John McCain probably has in mind with his proposed 'pool'.

I don't think so. During the primaries, when criticized by the Democratic candidates for the shortcomings in his plan, McCain gave a speech at the Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute at the University of South Florida.

There's an audio available  here , but you'll have to register. Alternatively, I'm going to post a summary from the  NYT  :

 
Unlike Mr. McCain, of Arizona, Senators Barack Obama of Illinois and Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York would make it illegal for health insurance companies to deny an applicant because of health status. They argue that such regulation is needed to end discrimination against those with pre-existing medical conditions.

Mr. McCain’s speech here implicitly acknowledged some of the shortcomings of his free-market approach. But rather than force insurers to stop cherry-picking the healthiest " and least expensive " patients, Mr. McCain proposed that the federal government work with states to cover those who cannot find insurance on the open market. With federal financial assistance, his plan would encourage states to create high-risk pools that would contract with insurers to cover consumers who have been rejected on the open market.

Mr. McCain was vague Tuesday about just how his safety net would be structured, and did not specify how much it might cost, leaving the details to negotiations with Congress and the states. But his top domestic policy adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, said in an interview that the federal share could cost between $7 billion and $10 billion " money he said could be redirected from existing federal programs that pay for uncompensated medical care, mainly in hospitals.

Mr. Holtz-Eakin said that sum, when combined with contributions expected from the states and insurers, could provide coverage for the five million to seven million uninsured people that he estimates cannot obtain it because of their health or age. There are 47 million uninsured people in the United States, or 16 percent of the population.
 
 
 
@Foxfyre,

 
Re what government program specifically: The government programs currently in existance are Medicare, Medicade, and VA and neither candidate suggests eliminating these.
 

Ah, I thought you were talking about new programs. Okay. Yes, the existing programs are not without problems.
 
 
@old europe,

Good find.

Here's what I zeroed in on:

 
Mr. McCain’s speech here implicitly acknowledged some of the shortcomings of his free-market approach. But rather than force insurers to stop cherry-picking the healthiest " and least expensive " patients, Mr. McCain proposed that the federal government work with states to cover those who cannot find insurance on the open market.

But his top domestic policy adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, said in an interview that the federal share could cost between $7 billion and $10 billion " money he said could be redirected from existing federal programs that pay for uncompensated medical care, mainly in hospitals.
 

So he is proposing a pool as I described though he is leaving room for some federal subsidy for that. It shouldn't be too difficult, with the tax credits he proposes, to shift $7 to $10 billion from waste in existing programs for that purpose should it be necessary. (As I said, NM Mutual has been so successful it has paid for itself, and I can't come up with any reason the same principle couldn't work on the federal level too. At the same time, I don't know if Arizona has anything comparable so McCain could be uninformed about that.)

The same source also reports that he adamently promised that he would not propose or condone another expensive government entitlement program.

I continue to favor any proposal that can improve on the existing system without taking away personal freedoms and choice.

So far nothing convinces me that Obama's plan is better than or even as promising as McCain's. But keep the observations, analysis, and conclusions coming.
 
 
@Foxfyre,

I have noticed in myself a tendency to interpret political events in the light that is most favorable to the realization of my most cherished and hopeful political outcomes. I suspect I am not alone. Reading many of the posts it is sometimes obvious which side of the political fence the author prefers. I am a fiscal conservative that prefers smaller government intrusion into our private lives less regulation and more promotion of self dependence. Accordingly, people should be able to keep more of their self accumulated wealth whether retained by hard work and/or innovation.

I do believe that, ultimately, we are “on our own”. It is nice to believe that government should provide (in some, temporary, circumstances) “safety nets” for us but over time these slip progressively into entitlements and from there to addictive social programs, always. Additionally, when politicians or bureaucrats try to “protect” us I am afraid
The federal government has legitimate responsibilities but its powers are limited because they are enumerated-- by the constitution itself.

As for what is currently referred to as Post-Partisanship, this is merely a “Hopeful Utopia” that may be likened to a political seven year entomological event whose rarity reflects either the desperation or banality of the political moment (Does anybody think the Social Security/Medicare problem will be solved without compromise? Alternatively, who would vote for Chinese made toys sprayed with lead paint?) Its existence will be a short lived aberration and justly so. Madison saw the wrangling and back biting of politics as a given. His genius was in using it to average opinions and quell passions in order to moderate, via checks and balances, government actions and legislation.

In American two party politics there are those of one side who long for a Scandinavian model of government"cradle to grave type safety nets for all. Then there are those who call themselves pragmatists who prefer to take care of themselves and their families and who recognize that hard work and ingenuity must be financially rewarded if they are expected to continue. The former see the latter as uncaring and mean but, as a member of the meanies, I wonder if we are being excoriated merely because we keep pointing out stubborn worldly economic truths. As a meanie I see the former as pie-in-the-sky utopian idealists who refuse to come to grips with reality, but maybe they have something. Maybe I’m missing something. So perhaps we can compromise, but whatever the compromise I still wonder: Who will pay for it?

Not surprisingly I will vote for Johnny Maverick and Sarah Barracuda. But will they get elected despite Obamamania? The columns in both Berlin and Denver were impressive. It seems a lot of Europeans are for an Obama U.S. Presidency but we all know the problems involved when candidates for U.S. office depend upon the fickle European vote for success.
Palin’s entrance, we are told, has energized the GOP base. Well maybe, but McCain has taken a big chance with her hasn’t he? Maybe, but do you think Lieberman as his VP pick would have helped him get elected? Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee had their own problems with past flirtations with liberal programs in their respective governorships. I thought McCain was down and out during the GOP primaries. Then I thought there was no way McCain would be able to defeat the crowd mentality-- this flocking, this gathering of lemming proportions that is Obama’s biggest asset, his second being G.W. Bush’s tenure. After all the polls gave the Dems, overall, a 10 " 20 percent lead. But, Obama’s lead in the polls over McCain is much less. Why? It seems some voters may want more specific information other than promises of “change” and “Hope”.

McCain was never going to appeal to the conservative GOP simply because, unlike G.W. Bush in 2000, he was not perceived as another R. Reagan. But the GOP is slowly realizing that neither is anyone else. The times, they are a chang’n. Palin (the only candidate of the selected four with executive experience), like McCain, seems not to govern with policy in mind so much as with reactionary fervor to insults to their moral standards. This sounds good at first but it does make it difficult to predict what either would do given specific unknown events in the future. McCain does have a history of trying to prevent immoralist behavior like when he and Senator Feingold passed campaign finance “reform”. This is a disaster and probably is unconstitutional in the strictest sense. It also has allowed governments and incumbencies even more advantage than before by further restricting opponents free speech simply by restricting political contributions at various times and to various political entities. It would have been simpler to allow any and all contributions given total transparency as the only requirement. McCain’s governing philosophy is more moralistic than political. His call for sensible and humanitarian immigration reform and his efforts to work with the Dems on this issue illustrates this moralistic bent. His views and knowledge about the economy and market systems and their relevance to and from monetary and (even) fiscal policy are, at best, only in their formative stage, although he seems to understand generally how disastrous those policies of Obama and his fellow party members would be for the country long term. Unlike the Democrats, Republicans are more likely to use both methods to balance governmental budgets and are more likely to limit spending before raising revenue given McCain’s election success. McCain has promised to veto a lot of spending bills"earmarks, pork, etc. and given the likely prospect of a concurrent democratically controlled congress McCain will be the only check against a repeat of Democratic spending excesses like the Great Society.

McCain has his faults but at least we know, pretty much what they are. Obama keeps having his versions of Clinton’s “Bimbo Eruptions”. Every so often things like his friendship with an old non repentant terrorist, 20 years of exposing his family to men of the cloth who “God Damn America”, and real estate deals with now convicted felons pop up. What else isn’t he telling us? Has he explained that part of his “tax cut” includes increasing the income redistribution program known as Earned Income Credit? This program pays those who do not pay taxes a “refund”. Ask yourself this: if these people do not pay taxes where does the money for the “refund” come from, Scandinavia? “Change” and “Hope” are rather nebulous concepts for the strongest nation on earth to elect their leader. Are we to “Hope” that the “Change” Obama promises will be to our liking?

@JamesMorrison,

Hi James, and welcome to the thread. A well constructed post with a lot of food for thought in it there.

I think the one thing that makes this election somewhat different than recent past elections is that it is maybe less universally partisan. I haven't really looked for stats, but it seems that there are a much larger group of independents and undecideds than there has been in the past. There are more Democrats than Republicans yes, and though this has always been true, that has been exacerbated by the unpopularity of our President and irresponsible Republicans in Congress plus the rock star phenomon of Obamamania.

According to Rasmussen, however, both Obama and McCain enjoy high approval ratings within their respective parties, but McCan has a higher approval rating with Republicans and Independents than Obama does with Democrats and Independents and that has evened the playing field a bit so that the two are essentially tied in the polls today.

For that reason I want to keep pushing the issues and hope there are enough likely voters out there who want the best candidate they can get and who will choose their candidate after a hard, criticial look at the issues as well as the character and credibility of the candidates.

On a different note, I think if McCain prevails and is elected, we will know that he is a man of his word if he actually appoints Consitutional justices to the Supreme Court who would overturn McCain/Feingold.

48 - 45 McCain per Gallup, September 7, 2008

 http://www.lelandtribune.com/politicsgovt.asp?dismode=article&artid=1565 

How much more McCain bounce by tomorrow?
 
 
@okie,

 
 Gallup Daily: McCain Moves Ahead, 48% to 45% 

McCain enjoying increase in support following convention

PRINCETON, NJ -- The latest  Gallup Poll Daily tracking  update shows John McCain moving ahead of Barack Obama, 48% to 45%, when registered voters are asked for whom they would vote if the presidential election were held today.

 

These results are based on Sept. 4-6 interviewing, and include two full days of polling after the conclusion of the Republican National Convention last Thursday night. McCain has outpolled Obama on both Friday and Saturday, and is receiving a convention bounce just as  Obama did last week .

Tomorrow's report will be the first in which all interviews were conducted after the conclusion of the convention. Gallup measures convention bounces by comparing candidate support in the last poll done entirely before a party's presidential nominating convention begins with the first polling conducted entirely after its conclusion.

McCain's 48% share of the vote ties for his largest since Gallup tracking began in early March. He registered the same level of support in early May. This is also McCain's largest advantage over Obama since early May, when he led by as much as six percentage points. Obama has led McCain for most of the campaign, and for nearly all of the time since clinching the Democratic nomination in early June. (To view the complete trend since March 7, 2008,  click here .) -- Jeff Jones

 
 
 
@okie,

This graph is especially for cyclops, as he loves to post these when Obama is looking good.

 

Sorry, oe, you already posted same time, but it doesn't hurt to show again, as cyclops loves to see these graphs.
 
 
@okie,

Yes, Rasmussen has them even and the RCP average has Obama ahead be less than 1 point the last time I looked. I think all, including Gallup, are within the margin of error so statistically, it is a dead heat at the moment. However, we won't have the full Rasmussen vote following McCain's speech until tomorrow so I'm anxious to see if there is any movement.
 
 
@okie,

okie, If the range is between 41 and 50, nobody can gain 11 points; the max is 9.
 
 
@cicerone imposter,

ci, if say hypothetically Obama goes from 50 to 41 up, to 41 to 50 down, that I think is an 18 point swing or bounce, not a 9 point swing. You have 9% of the voters switching, but it ends up an 18 point swing, or bounce, I think?

Official pollsters that use this terminology, am I right or wrong?
 
 
@okie,

One thing that I notice is that McCain's numbers remained fairly constant during
the dual bounce gained from The Rock Star's European Tour and Denver convention.

The dual bounce that Palin's speech and Wisconsin convention netted McCain continues to grow while the chosen one looses ground...

The bottom line: Obama is in trouble.
 
 
@H2O MAN,

As Obama goes into the attack mode, this destroys his image of being a uniter, an above the fray kind of guy. Lets face it, he never has been a uniter above the fray kind of guy, you can't be as a Chicago politician.

And hey, we must remember, this guy had the gall to run when Hillary was the anointed one, after all, she deserved it, doesn't everyone remember that? After all, she endured being dissed and trodden upon as the faithful wife of Bill and corruption manager when Bill was galavanting around the world and inside the whitehouse. EVERYONE assumed it belonged to Hillary. They only gave credence to Obama because of THE SPEECH, only for publicity purposes and never dreamed he would have the nerve to run, and if he did, he would have no chance, but here he is. The Clintonistas underestimated how many people wanted somebody else instead of the Clintons.

So it will be interesting as Obama goes into attack mode, but I'm sure he is counting on the media to do most of the carrying the water for him in that regard.
 
 
@ebrown p,

That's one. Got any others?
 
 
Good morning all. The market is soaring, at least for now, and the word from the more objective polling analysts is that the voters are beginning to look a bit more favorably at McCain re the economy now. (Obama has had an edge there for many months.) Maybe the bloggers who are doing more than throwing sh*t at the wall are actually beginning to have an effect and there is actually beginning to be a focus on the issues?

Wouldn't THAT be interesting?

Meanwhile, the campaign to destroy Sarah Palin continues. After reports from locals hearing from local Democrat leaders, I am absolutely 100% convinced that the Obama is behind it at least to some extent. You sure don't hear the messiah standing up and denouncing it; rather he just (again) says that this is not his position and he disapproves that sort of thing.

This morning Rasmussen report shows McCain and Obama still statistically tied, but there are other numbers I have observed moving that are interesting. For instance:

 
McCain leads by four points among men while Obama leads by three among women. On Tuesday, when Obama’s lead peaked, he had a fourteen point advantage among women....

Forty-one percent (41%) of voters say that they are certain they will cast their ballot for McCain and will not change their mind before November. Thirty-eight percent (38%) say the same about Obama. Overall, McCain is now viewed favorably by 60% of the nation’s voters while Obama earns positive reviews from 55% (see trends).
 

In the end it may be those statistics that make the difference.

RCP average has McCain up 1.2 this morning. Yesterday he trailed -.08 Both statistically insignificant but interesting to watch to see if there is a clear trend developing.
 
 
@Foxfyre,

The Albuquerque Journal this morning says that Obama is now saying he will give the weathiest Americans a reprieve and may not rescind the Bush tax cuts if he is elected. He hasn't gone so far as to say he won't allow them to expire as currently scheduled. While allowing those tax cuts to expire is still alarming from an economic point of view, it is definitely telling that Obama sees that confidence in his economic plan is slipping. At the very least, it is another Obama flipflop to add to the growing list while he fishes for the most politically expedient positions to take.

(It's also a pretty good indication that we have to keep up with the candidates day by day and can't depend on the websites to tell it like it is.)
 
 
@Foxfyre,

Foxfyre, the taxcut issue is interesting, because Democrats have claimed that taxcuts do not help the economy, yet their actions speak otherwise. If they didn't think they helped, why would they talk about keeping the taxcuts to help the economy? They speak out of both sides of their mouth. Why don't they stick to their beliefs, if that is what they believe, that taxcuts only benefit the rich, that trickle down economics doesn't work, right? Alot of their words and actions are totally contradictory.

Yup, real interesting. They HATE when we point out JFK's position about tax cuts spurring the economy and acknowledgment that increasing taxes can deepen a recession. Sadly, JFK was the last of the old style, honorable Democrats (fiscally speaking). I gave LBJ the benefit of the doubt but now see how much of his new style Democrat liberalism/socialism has been sooooooo misguided and, with a Democrat controlled Congress, Nixon/Ford were unable to reverse that. And I gave Carter the benefit of the doubt. After him I left the Democratic Party though.

Obama, of course, is clearly on the record that for him it isn't a matter of effect but a matter of fairness. I guess he has now decided maybe winning an election is more important than being 'fair'.  
 
 
Well, McCain certainly has got his bounce out of the convention. This is why I was cautioning others on Friday not to get too ahead of themselves re: the polling.

It will be interesting to see some state polling now. Most of the state polls we have are pretty out of date, and at this point I don't trust the state polling maps as much as I used to. I would predict that by the end of the week, we see a return to the parity we had before; but if not, Obama better start making news in one way or another, if he wants to turn this thing around. He'd be foolish to make the same mistake that Kerry did and wait for the debates without really taking the attack to his opponent.

Just got this in my e-mail. I hunted up the link. I can't tell you how significant I believe this is. Finally, maybe just MAYBE the Fourth Estate has decided they need to regain some integrity and credibility????? That alone could significantly change the direction of this election. If the media does its job, neither McCain nor Obama can get away with hiding their records/associations/comments/opinions in advance of the election, and we won't have to dig that out of a mountain of innuendo and distortions and flat out lies.

I hope I hope I hope. (emphasis mine)

 
Keith Olbermann, Chris Matthews Booted From MSNBC Political Anchor Desk
September 8, 2008

Keith Olbermann may be the “voice” of MSNBC, but network executives have decided to yank the talkmeister off its politican anchor desk after the cable channel finishing dead last in the Nielsen rankings of all news coverage during the two weeks of political conventions.

The network announced Monday that Olbermann and Chris Matthews have both been booted as co-hosts on political night coverage in favor of David Gregory, whose White House press corps experience may make him better suited to deliver sober and less opinion-driven assessments of the news.

All summer, MSNBC executives have fought off complaints that Olbermann and Matthews, the network’s top commentators, could serve in the role of impartial newsmen. Those complaints reached a crescendo last week when Olbermann, reporting on the Republican National Convention from New York rather than St. Paul, apologized to the audience after the channel aired a Sept. 11 video tribute crafted by the RNC.

“We would be rightly eviscerated at all quarters, perhaps by the Republican Party itself, for exploiting the memories of the dead, and perhaps even for trying to evoke that pain again. If you reacted to that videotape the way I did, I apologize,” Olbermann said.

The network’s weak ratings during the conventions may have given MSNBC executives the cover they needed to boot Olbermann and Matthews. FOX News Channel topped all broadcast and cable networks with 9.2 million viewers on each of the last two nights of the convention. MSNBC got barely more than a quarter of Fox’s total "2.5 million viewers.

MSNBC also ranked last among the three cable channels during primetime coverage of the last two nights of the Democratic convention.

Olbermann’s hard left views and his catfights with other MSNBC hosts have been the talk of gossip pages all summer. Olbermann sarcastically dismissed Republican pundit Pat Buchanan on the air after Buchanan said the GOP had been enlivened by Sarah Palin’s vice presidential nomination.

“Those reading Us Weekly with the picture of her and her youngest daughter with the word ’scandal’ written across it won’t be so happy,” Olbermann said.

He also expressed no regard for the GOP’s push back against rumors about Palin’s personal life.

“We’ll see if people feel sorry for unfounded rumors on the Internet,” he said. “If that’s the case, Senator Obama’s probably standing up and cheering and waiting for people to feel sorry for him.”

Olbermann’s brash style may also have earned him enemies within his own organization. He was caught on microphones mocking another MSNBC host, Joe Scarborough, when Scarborough was discussing positive developments in McCain’s campaign.

“Jesus, Joe, why don’t you get a shovel?” he asked.

At another time, Matthews snapped at Olbermann on-air when it appeared Olbermann was criticizing him for talking too much. Matthews told TVNewser last week that he and Olbermann get along fine. It’s not clear when Matthews was informed of the decision to bounce him from the anchor spot along with Olbermann.

Asked about the internal fighting at MSNBC, NBC anchor Brian Williams tried to smooth ruffled feathers during an appearance on Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show” last week.

“Is there no control?” asked host Jon Stewart. “Is it ‘Lord of the Flies’?”

Williams replied that every family has a dynamic of its own.

“But does MSNBC have to be the Lohans?” Stewart said.

As a result of the internal turmoil, Gregory will now anchor MSNBC’s coverage of the presidential and vice presidential debates, as well as on election night, said network spokesman Jeremy Gaines.

Olbermann did score an interview with Barack Obama on his “Countdown” show. That is set to air Monday and will go up against Bill O’Reilly’s interview with Obama on FOX News. A portion of the O’Reilly interview with Obama aired last Thursday and earned O’Reilly his second highest rating ever, with more than 6.6 million viewers.

From what I'm reading, he's sending lots of surrogates out to the states to do his attacking for him. He's above that sort of thing after all. Don't worry. The Obama campaign will get in a lot of licks and his disciples will be doing their part to ensure that Sarah Palin is smeared and slimed with as much as they can find or make up to slime her with.

Admit it, cyclops, you've been crowing about Obama having this in the bag for months, every day almost, right here on this forum.
 
 
@Foxfyre,

You quote the Journal here, Foxfyre (from page A7).

Coming back to yesterday's discussion with oe, about healthcare, you perhaps missed the "UpFront" on the frontapage and page A2 of your home newspaper:

"Want Health Care Reform? Don’t Take ‘No’ for an Answer":

 
[...]We talk endlessly about uninsured children in New Mexico, when the far bigger problem is working adults who make too little to afford insurance and too much to qualify for public help. We fret about insurance company administrative costs, which in New Mexico were about 11 percent of premium dollars last year, and spend no time on the accelerating salaries and mind-boggling waste spurring medical costs, which were about 84 percent of premium dollars.

Partly it’s because we also talk about implementation details instead of the values that we citizens want a health care system to reflect.

What we look like

In Britain right now, the national health system is falling apart, for the same reason our system is struggling. It costs too much. The British ration care by withholding services and making people wait. Americans ration care by allowing 47 million people to have no insurance.

Polling shows that the British will accept the waits and the lack of services as long as everybody has the same wait and the same lack of services. Egalitarianism is a value system, and the health system reflects it.

Polling in the United States shows that most people dislike the nation’s health system in the abstract but rather like their own care. Arithmetic shows that, if 47 million Americans have no coverage, about 250 million do.

Our continuing inactivity shows that 47 million uninsured is consistent with our value system.

Therefore, I have a modest legislative proposal of my own: Since we don’t do what is required to cover the uninsured, let us ban, by law, the use of the word “uninsured” until we’re serious about solving the problem.
 
 
 
@Walter Hinteler,

No I didn't miss it Walter. (For the benefit of the others on the thread, his clip is from an opinion piece by Winthrop Quigley who contributes to the Journal from time to time. IMO sometimes he makes sense. Sometimes he doesn't.)

I do think the discussion of healthcare yesterday addresses his points, however, and he would have been more credible if he had at least referenced what the two Presidential candidates are proposing and looking to see if they might provide some solutions to the problems he sees. I don't give much time to those who can only state the problems and cast blame for them but don't want to do the hard mental work required to determine the best possible solutions for those problems.

Well, I still think he's the clear favorite to win. But McCain has reached his highest levels of the race so far, and if he maintains these levels, Obama most certainly will not be the clear favorite to win any longer.

Cycloptichorn
 
 
Obama is still the favorite according to Vegas and via Rasmussen's own odds making system:

 
The Rasmussen Reports Balance of Power Calculator currently shows Obama leading in states with 193 Electoral College votes while McCain leads in states with 183 votes (see Quick Campaign Overview). When leaners are included, it’s Obama 264, McCain 247 (see 50-State Summary).

Data from Rasmussen Markets currently gives Obama a 52.0% chance of winning in November.
 

That 52% is down a significant amount from earlier odds though, so the race is beginning to get closer so far as the odds go. It will be interesting to see if the numbers change now that we're in the home stretch.
 
 
@Cycloptichorn,

 
Well, I still think he's the clear favorite to win. But McCain has reached his highest levels of the race so far, and if he maintains these levels, Obama most certainly will not be the clear favorite to win any longer.

 

McCain's rise has just begun and Obama's fall should continue... especially after he debates McCain.
 
 
Oh, and as a reminder to everybody, from that MSNBC article I posted a bit ago:

In the positively delicious category, would you believe that Barack Obama and his surrogates who have taken every opportunity to use every single McCain gaffe and numerous out-of-context statements in an ad or otherwise to distort McCain's position are now complaining that some are using his gaffe when he recently referred to his faith as "my Muslim faith"?

And he is complaining that while McCain isn’t violating Obama’s rules about what is off limits, Fox News and bloggers et al are? As if he himself doesn’t ‘stay above the fray’ and stays silent while CNN, MSNBC, ABC, NBC, CBS et al and the bloggers slime McCain and Sarah Palin with impunity?

Hypocrisy, thy name is Obama. (I swear folks, they are beginning to self destruct. The messiah’s halo is looking more and more skewed, tarnished, and tipped lately.)

It is getting goooooooood.

Obama's verbal slip fuels his critics
Christina Bellantoni
Sunday, September 7, 2008

ST. LOUIS, Mo. - Sen. Barack Obama's foes seized Sunday upon a brief slip of the tongue, when the Democratic presidential nominee was outlining his Christianity but accidentally said, "my Muslim faith."

The three words -- immediately corrected -- were during an exchange with ABC's George Stephanopoulos on "This Week," when he was trying to criticize the quiet smear campaign suggesting he is a Muslim.

But illustrating the difficulty of preventing false rumors about his faith from spreading, anti-Obama groups within one hour of the interview had sliced it out of context and were sending it around via email. They also were blogging about it.

Mr. Obama, who is a Christian and often proudly speaks about how his faith has influenced his public service, said he finds it "deeply offensive" that there are efforts "coming out of the Republican camp to suggest that perhaps I'm not who I say I am when it comes to my faith."

The exchange came after Mr. Obama said that Republicans are attempting to scare voters by suggesting he is not Christian, which McCain campaign manager Rick Davis said was "cynical."

Asked about it on ABC, Mr. Obama said, "These guys love to throw a rock and hide their hand."

"The McCain campaign has never suggested you have Muslim connections," said Mr. Stephanopoulos, who repeatedly interrupted Mr. Obama during the interview.

"I don't think that when you look at what is being promulgated on Fox News, let's say, and Republican commentators who are closely allied to these folks," Mr Obama responded, and Mr. Stephanopoulos interrupted: "But John McCain said that's wrong."

Mr. Obama noted that when Republican vice presidential nominee Gov. Sarah Palin "was forced" to talk about her pregnant 17-year-old daughter, he issued a forceful statement to reporters that the line of inquiry was "off limits." But he said the McCain campaign tried to tie him to "liberal blogs that support Obama" and are "attacking Governor Palin."

"Let's not play games," he said. "What I was suggesting -- you're absolutely right that John McCain has not talked about my Muslim faith. And you're absolutely right that that has not come."

Mr. Stephanopoulos interrupted with, "Christian faith."

"My Christian faith," Mr. Obama said quickly. "Well, what I'm saying is that he hasn't suggested that I'm a Muslim. And I think that his campaign's upper echelons have not, either. What I think is fair to say is that, coming out of the Republican camp, there have been efforts to suggest that perhaps I'm not who I say I am when it comes to my faith -- something which I find deeply offensive, and that has been going on for a pretty long time."

Asked to comment on the accidental misstatement illustrating the difficulty of the issue, Obama spokesman Bill Burton offered this comment: "I'm not surprised that the only outlet doing this story is The Washington Times."

In other news, today Palin said:

 
Speaking before voters in Colorado Springs, the Republican vice presidential nominee claimed that lending giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had "gotten too big and too expensive to the taxpayers." The companies, as McClatchy reported, "aren't taxpayer funded but operate as private companies. The takeover may result in a taxpayer bailout during reorganization."
 

Whoops - turns out she didn't know a damn thing about Fannie and Freddie and how they work. Not even a gaffe really, just a sign of incompetence. A sign of more to come?

You were accusing Obama, though. Not bloggers or people who send around chain emails.

By that logic, we would have to conclude that McCain claims that Obama is a terrorist who wants to turn the United States into a theocracy.

On the other hand, if that's not what you're claiming, we can test your hypothesis by finding a McCain gaffe and having you come up with an Obama ad that used the gaffe against McCain.

I'll not give you any bullshit if you can find another source that collaborates it. As I said, I don't think Palin was even in Colorado this weekend, but I don't know that for certain.

If she did say it, yes, it would show some inexperience on that subject. She'll have four years as VP to bone up, however, if she and McCain are elected. Meanwhile I would put it in the same category as Obama stating that we need to pull Arabic interpretors out of Iraq and send them to Afghanistan where Arabic isn't spoken or his stating that the UN Security Council should deal with Russia's invasion of Georgia and having to be advised that Russia has veto power on the UN Security Council.

Obama is #1 on the Democrat ticket. Palin is #2.

That's not going to make any difference according to past and current history; the republicans still don't fear the loss of jobs and homes to make sure McCain/Palin wins in November. I'm not sure how they are able to rationalize that in their brains, but I've never been good at analyzing why people do things in the name of politics or religion.

You sure don't hear the messiah standing up and denouncing it; rather he just (again) says that this is not his position and he disapproves that sort of thing.
 

And okie had something to say too. I am just wondering what specifically you all are talking about. That's all. No need to get defensive about it. It's just a question.

To counter Palin, Obama to dispatch female surrogates

By Patrick Healy and Jeff Zeleny
Published: September 5, 2008

 
ST. PAUL: Senator Barack Obama will increasingly lean on prominent Democratic women to undercut Governor Sarah Palin and Senator John McCain, dispatching Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton to Florida on Monday and creating a rapid-response team to deploy female surrogates to battleground states, Obama advisers said on Thursday.,,,,

....While Obama did not aggressively challenge Palin in the wake of her withering attack on Wednesday night, his advisers opened a new line of criticism on Thursday to brand her as part of the Republican establishment.

As for him being above the fray, don't mistake his plea for a better discourse for a white flag. You don't win elections by laying down for your opponents.

As for him being above the fray, don't mistake his plea for a better discourse for a white flag. You don't win elections by laying down for your opponents.

 

You say to-mah-to, I say to-may-to. I translate words like 'undercut' and 'brand' as pretty much the same thing as 'attack'.

It's entirely predictable that the Obama-gushing media will use different language, words, phrases, emphasis in describing the two candidates. We're talking NYT in this case. Some perspective is helpful at times.
 
 
@Foxfyre,

 
You say to-mah-to, I say to-may-to. I translate words like 'undercut' and 'brand' as pretty much the same thing as 'attack'.

 

Interesting.

How about this, when he or one of his surrogates actually utters an "attack" that seems unfair to you, go ahead and quote it. That will save us all some time.

McCain, Palin criticize Obama on earmarks

By SARA KUGLER, Associated Press Writer 37 minutes ago

LEE'S SUMMIT, Mo. - John McCain and Sarah Palin criticized Democrat Barack Obama over the amount of money he has requested for his home state of Illinois, even though Alaska under Palin's leadership has asked Washington for 10 times more money per citizen for pet projects.
 
 
 
@Foxfyre,

"undercut" and "brand" were words chosen by the author of the piece. They were not used by Obama that I can see.

I hardly see it as an "attack" to try to "brand" someone as a republican, do you? Yes, candidates try to win the battle by describing their opponents but that isn't really an attack to my knowledge unless it is to demonize them in some way.

"Undercut' and 'brand' were the terms the author of the piece used to describe what Obama's surrogates were attempting to do to Palin. And if all that was implied was a "Republican", I would agree. More was implied in the story than that.
 
 
@cicerone imposter,

ci, something you might wish to consider in regard to the feds spending money in various states, Alaska is geographically by far the largest state in the union, so infrastructure or federal expenditures are not tied solely to population, but may also be related to land area and the infrastructure, preservation, conservation, and management relative to that land. Furthermore, Alaska is a relatively undeveloped state, not mature in terms of infrastructure, and also has a different rate of population growth than other states, all of which also influences the scenario. So considering the small population of Alaska, expressing earmark numbers per capita is virtually meaningless in my opinion, and most certainly misleading.

I haven't even commented on pork barrel spending or earmarks in any detail, beyond my casual comments now, but before I did, I think a good amount of research would be necessary to understand the truth about this. I suspect there is so much ignorance about this, that it would be astonishing. And I doubt seriously that McCain will veto every earmark, I find that a tall tale for sure. And I know Obama wouldn't.
 
 
@Foxfyre,

So in other words, your argument about the attack is based on an implication you got from a story. Ok.. now it makes more sense because I wasn't seeing any attack.
 
 
@parados,

The attack is what the surrogates are being sent out to do. "Undercut" and "brand as" = attack. I don't know how to make it any plainer. Of course when you do selective reading and cherry pick phrases to present as something different than what was written, you probably won't quite get it will you?
 
 
@okie,

LIke the bridge to nowhere? You are kidding, right?
 
 
@Foxfyre,

"undercut" and "brand as" are NOT what they are being told to do by the Obama campaign. It is the word chosen by the author. It could be the wrong word choice for all we know.

You make it plain all right. You want to believe it is an attack so will accept the word chosen and then blow it up beyond that word choice without regard to what the underlying facts really are.

Meanwhile you completely ignore the author's choice of the words "withering attack" in describing what Palin did. I see his word choice there as overblown so can only assume his other choices are as well.
 
 
Quote:

 
ST. PAUL: Senator Barack Obama will increasingly lean on prominent Democratic women to undercut Governor Sarah Palin and Senator John McCain, dispatching Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton to Florida on Monday and creating a rapid-response team to deploy female surrogates to battleground states, Obama advisers said on Thursday.,,,,

....While Obama did not aggressively challenge Palin in the wake of her withering attack on Wednesday night, his advisers opened a new line of criticism on Thursday to brand her as part of the Republican establishment.

Yes, it could be the wrong word choice for all we know. But everything I've been reading re Obama's new strategy, including the clip CI just posted, suggests that the author is quite appropriate in the word choices.

Don't get me wrong. I'm not faulting Obama for doing it. I AM faulting those, including him, who suggest he is above that sort of thing. To that I say baloney. Especially when he is becoming increasingly shrill and frantic and defensive in his rhetoric. Almost all news stories today were full of Obama condemning McCain and Palin for criticizing Obama.

(Yes his primary thrust is to condemn them for distorting his record/words etc. even as he distorts theirs.   )
 
 
@Foxfyre,

One of Obama's strategies now seems to be victimhood.

Lets take this religion thing. He constantly claims he is Christian, thats fine and dandy, but he should realize that some things about his church are a very contradictory to most Christian beliefs and that he therefore should not blame people for being a bit puzzled. Lets take the Black Liberation theology. It is very strong on being devoted to Africa, and some kind of political program relative to liberating blacks, which is not very mainstream Christian. Also, some have claimed the church has openly Muslim members. I don't know if this is true, but it has been reported. Also, the pastors, they have made some very controversial statements, and Wright openly admires Farrakhan, whats up with that? And Obama himself went to the million man march, didn't he? So how can he blame people for being a bit puzzled over it and being somewhat suspicious about what Obama's beliefs really are. I won't accuse him of being a Muslim, but I honestly don't know where he is coming from in regard to his religion. What I do know does not gender alot of trust.

Contrast that with somebody like Romney, a Mormon. Lots of funny beliefs in the Mormon way, but I see nothing there that is anti-American or sympathetic to Islam, same with most other Christian religions, I would simply say hey, that is their business. But in the case of Obama, alot of things don't really add up, from my reading of it, his church is more of a political organization than it is a church or religion.

Just my opinion, Democrats and Obama defenders, go ahead and pile on, but thats how I see it, and I suspect that if most people are honest, they would also agree.
 
 
@cicerone imposter,

The bridge to nowhere was not a good project, probably, but I suspect there are thousands of projects that we never hear about that are more useless than it was. And it is probably a useful project, just that the Alaskans should pay for it if they want it, just like everywhere else. I constantly hear of grants for this and that. Grants have to be the worst invention ever.
 
 
@okie,

My post about Obama playing the victim in regard to his religion, my point was that his complaints in that regard are a bit tiresome, and surely he is not so naive as to believe that some of the stuff about his pastor, his church, as I outlined above, are not going to gender questions and distrust. I think he knows that, or should know that, and I wonder sometimes if it isn't intentional, its all part of the game he plays, which includes playing dumb.
 
 
@okie,

That bridge to nowhere has been HUGE in the Obama rhetoric the last couple of days. Yes Sarah flipflopped on that, but geez....she was the mayor of a little town and her Senator offered her a bridge. She almost certainly didn't have time to think that through or hear the criticisms against it when she said great.

I can certainly see how, with more experience under her belt and from the perspective of a Governor with major budget decisions to make, she could change her mind about that and think it wasn't such a good idea. And then decline it. It wasn't out of political expediency for sure since the office of vice president for her wasn't even a gleam in anybody's eye at the time.

I don't expect the Obama campaign to be magnanimous or honest about that any more than they are being honest about anything to do with Sarah Palin, but I think it is probably time to start countering it with some of Obama's major flipflops. And he has pulled some doozies. The difference between him and her is he tries to pretend 'well he really didn't mean it before' or 'that isn't what I intended' or 'I didn't say it in exactly that way' or any number of other phrases to deny a flipflip.
 
 
@okie,

Probably? Come on, okie, let's play honest here. It's pork with a capital "P."
 
 
@cicerone imposter,

Yes which she no doubt came to realize. Which is why, as Governor, she elected to refuse it. As I explained in some detail.
 
 
@Foxfyre,

Fox, She still accepted the funding for it.
 
 
@Foxfyre,

I had a fairly lengthy discussion about 'pork' with our elected representative here some time back. He didn't like it but he was powerless to stop it. And he rationalized that if the money is going to be distributed back to the states regardless, our state should get a fair share. So he applied for it in areas where he thought there was the greatest need. And he snagged some.

But I've also read of some of the horrendously expensive and completely ridiculous grants and various projects that go into the pork just so elected representatives can brag about what they have done for their state.

I think we should throw EVERYBODY OUT and start over with a clear mandate of what is and is not the appropriate function of government.
 
 
@cicerone imposter,

CI she agreed to it as mayor but never received the funding because it was blocked in Congress. As governor she did not accept it at all. She never got the bridge. She never got the money to build a bridge. She changed her mind and refused the bridge. Okay?
 
 
@cicerone imposter,

How many mayors wouldn't, ci?
 
 
@okie,

Okie and Fox..
You might want to check your atlas or some other map of Alaska.
Wasilla is NOT Ketchican. In fact it isn't even CLOSE to Ketchikan. The are about 1000 miles apart.

As mayor of Wasilla, Palin had no reason to support the bridge to nowhere.
 
 
@Foxfyre,

 
CI she agreed to it as mayor but never received the funding because it was blocked in Congress. As governor she did not accept it at all. She never got the bridge. She never got the money to build a bridge. She changed her mind and refused the bridge. Okay?

 

Err, you are half right. She never got the bridge, but she did get the money for the bridge.
 
 
@FreeDuck,

Maybe more like 1/4 right. (Or less.)

As governor, she wanted it, but she didn't get ENOUGH money for it, to her dismay:

 
It's bogus to say that Palin turned on the project because the costs ballooned. The real reason she came around to opposing it was not that the overall costs went up -- the project was always a boondoggle, and costs were always going up -- but that one particular element of the project's cost ballooned: The portion that Alaska would have to pay, instead of getting the money through federal pork.

In her statement finally ending the project, Palin explicitly lamented that fact. "Despite the work of our congressional delegation, we are about $329-million short of full funding for the bridge project," Palin said at the time, "and it's clear that Congress has little interest in spending any more money on a bridge between Ketchikan and Gravina Island."

As for the claim that Palin drove a stake into the project's heart, the project was practically dead already by the time Palin officially shut it down, as the non-partisan CQ's PolitiFact section pointed out. She shut it down after it became clear that Congress would no longer fund it -- meaning that Alaska would have to use its own $329 million to build it, thus leaving Palin no other choice but to shut it down.

Bottom line: Palin did not tell Congress, "Thanks, but no thanks," on the bridge. It was Congress who cut off the money to Alaska. Oh, and she didn't Say No To Pork, either -- when Congress wouldn't spend that money on the Bridge, Congress did allow her to keep it for other projects. And she did.

@sozobe,

After doing some research, you are correct that Palin initially supported the Bridge which was actually part of the normal Federal apportionment to Alaska and turned down the money when it was determind that it was insufficient to build the bridge. So while she is technically correct that she turned it down, she may be stretching it as to her motives for doing so. (Imagine a politician doing that!)

I could find nothing that indicated she had any official position on it as Mayor and, as Parados pointed out, she would have no logical official interest in a bridge many miles from her town. So any flip flop here appears to have happened when she was Governor and was based on fiscal practicality rather than on any outright rejection of the bridge. But she isn't lying when she says that she refused the bridge either, because in the end she did.

Another factor could be related to the real catfight that occurred between the media and Alaska's Congressional delegation. The Bridge really was never about the Governor

Excerpt

 
The bridge has become an object of national ridicule and a symbol of the fiscal irresponsibility of many in Congress toward the money entrusted to them by the taxpayers. It has also become an embarrassment to the people of Alaska and to responsible members of Congress who now find themselves tarred by the same brush dipped in the muck of the highway bill.

In response to this national humiliation, many in Alaska have vented their anger in the state’s newspapers, and the papers’ editors have also objected to the bridge on their editorial pages.

In the Anchorage Daily News, Diane Mucha of Eagle River wrote, “Of course, Alaska should and, hopefully, will volunteer to reject the money for the bridges to nowhere and Congress will apply the money for the hurricane relief efforts.”

David Raskin of Homer, Alaska, wrote, “Alaskans owe an apology to the people of New Orleans, to Alaska Native people and to the Nation for their selfish shortsightedness in sending these scoundrels to Washington and voting to keep them there.”

In the Ketchikan News, Dave Person wrote, “Thinking about the immense disaster in the Gulf States, it occurred to me that the most effective thing that the residents of Ketchikan could do to help would be to return the money earmarked for our Gravina Bridge.”

Back in Anchorage, Art Weiner wrote, “In a collective act of passion, the people of Alaska should request that the funds appropriated for our bridges be used for infrastructure reconstruction in the hurricane-affected area.”

Despite the willingness of many in Alaska to give back the bridge to pay for disaster relief, Alaska’s congressional delegation has dug in its heels, and many of the delegation’s colleagues, including all of congressional leadership, support its resistance. If Alaska loses some of its pork, they fear, so might they.

In opposing Senator Coburn’s amendment to defund the bridge, one prominent Senator told a closed-door meeting of conservatives that the plan was simply impractical. Many of the earmarks, he claimed, are counted towards a state’s equity bonus and thus are part of the state-by-state allocation formula. Defunding the bridge, he said, would direct at most $75 million to Louisiana, with the remaining $148 million returning to Alaska as money the state could use at its discretion for road projects.

Never mind that the Senator seems to view $75 million in taxpayers’ dollars as a sum of little consequence; what the Senator sees as a problem in fact would be a considerable benefit to Alaska. Assuming the Senator’s numbers are right, Alaska’s Department of Transportation would gain $148 million in money it could spend on the state’s transportation priorities instead of a useless bridge that would serve a tiny fraction of the state’s citizens.

And when Sarah turned down the bridge, she angered that Congressional delegation too:

 
On Friday, Alaska decided the bridge really was going nowhere, officially abandoning the project in Ketchikan that became a national symbol of federal pork-barrel spending.

While the move closes a chapter that has brought the state reams of ridicule, it also leaves open wounds in a community that fought for decades to get federal help.

"We went through political hot water -- tons of it -- and not just nationally but internationally," Ketchikan-Gateway Borough Mayor Joe Williams said. "We have nothing to show for it."

The $398 million bridge would have connected Ketchikan, on one island in southeastern Alaska, to its airport on another nearby island.

Gov. Sarah Palin said Friday the project was $329 million short of full funding.

"We will continue to look for options for Ketchikan to allow better access to the island," the Republican governor said. "The concentration is not going to be on a $400 million bridge."

Palin directed state transportation officials to find the most "fiscally responsible" alternative for access to the airport. She said the best option would be to upgrade the ferry system.

Ketchikan is Alaska's entry port for northbound cruise ships that bring more than 1 million visitors yearly. Every flight into Gravina Island requires a 15-minute ferry ride to reach the more densely populated Revillagigedo Island.

The town -- seven blocks wide and eight miles long -- has little room to grow. Local officials have said access to Gravina Island, population 50, is needed for the town and its economy to grow.

They called the state's decision premature, saying it came without warning.

"For somebody who touts process and transparency in getting projects done, I'm disappointed and taken aback," said state Rep. Kyle Johansen, R-Ketchikan. "We worked 30 years to get funding for this priority project."

U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens and Rep. Don Young, both Republicans, championed the project through Congress two years ago, securing more than $200 million for the bridge between Revillagigedo and Gravina islands.
 http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/09/22/alaska.bridge.ap/ 
 

That certainly backs up her credentials as a 'maverick' who is willing to buck the establishment.

All in all in those True/False analysis, we can say that Sarah's claim is partly, maybe even mostly true.
 
 
@Foxfyre,

Haha, she only 'turned it down' when it became clear that the Republican party itself had singled out the bridge as a boondoggle and waste of public funds. By the time she started talking against it, it was Young and Stevens who were fighting public opinion on the issue, not Palin! She was comfortably in the mainstream the whole time.

And it's inaccurate to say she 'turned down the money.' She didn't turn down the money. They KEPT the money and spent it on other stuff. It didn't save the taxpayers a dime.

Cycloptichorn
 
 
You must be basing your opinion on what you want the situation to be Cyclop as the verifiable articles that I posted suggest differently. If you have something credible that suggests differently, let's see it.
 
 
@Cycloptichorn,

Cyclotrolling.
 
 
@Foxfyre,

Let's just zoom out for a second. When Palin delivered that excellent "thanks but no thanks" line, what is the impression she left you with?

My impression was that here was a woman who ran an independent state, rejecting federal funds for boondoggles. "We'll build it ourselves." That's the American spirit. Independence! Off the federal dole!

The truth of the matter, however, leaves quite a different impression. Technically, she is right, she quashed the project. But was that because it was a waste of taxpayer money? Maybe it was a waste of Alaskan taxpayer money, but it would have been ok if all of the money came from the federal government -- meaning the rest of us. And furthermore, she did keep the money. I wonder what it was spent on. The impression I have now? She is just a regular old governor of a small state (in population) who hasn't been in power very long. She appreciates getting federal money just like every other state in the union. She shows evidence of standing against her own party. I don't know if that's on principle or because she sees the writing on the wall. Maybe it doesn't matter.
 
 
@FreeDuck,

If you will read what I said, you wil see that I agreed that her political rhetoric and her actual motive for rejecting the bridge doesn't wash and she wasn't telling the whole story in her rhetoric. And yes, this did (and was certainly calculated) to give a somewhat different impression than what actually happened. Which led me to my comment "Imagine a politician doing that!" As if McCain, Biden, and Obama don't all do that? A lot?

But neither was she flat out lying.

Which culminated in my conclusion that on the Truth/False meter, the statement is partly, perhaps mostly, true.

Lol. But you do admit that she didn't turn down the money, right? That she wasn't interested in saving anyone money? She only became against the bridge after it was clear the national Republican party was against it.

The CNN article you linked doesn't show that she 'angered' the Congressional delegation, both of which are on their way out for corruption.

So, her political reason for turning down the bridge isn't the same as what she has portrayed it as, and she kept the money to spend on other stuff, and she angered two corrupt politicians who were squarely against the national party on this issue - and her statement is 'mostly true?'   Which part of it was true?

Cycloptichorn
 
 
@Cycloptichorn,

No, she didn't turn down the money which would have been allocated to Alaska in any case. She did give up the money that went for New Orleans relief. She did anger the Congressional delegation as is clearly shown in the CNN article I posted. She did flipflop on the bridge after she became Governor and assessed the fiscal implications of the bridge from that vantage point and then decided that the bridge was not a good investment of the people's money. She actually gets kudos for that.

Again, as I have already said twice now, I won't give her kudos for omitting extenuating circumstances when whe uses the bridge for political advantage, but neither will I condemn her for that more than I condemn that kind of thing in any politician and Obama, Biden, and McCain as well as most politicians do that kind of thing a lot. I wish they wouldn't, but they do.

Again you are free to smear and slime her as much as you wish, Cyclop, but it remains your opinion alone unless you have a credible source that disputes other sources posted.

I guess I am having trouble with the whole "doesn't wash" = "partly, perhaps mostly, true" equation. But I'm not really interested in beating a dead horse.
 
 
Eight weeks to go today and nationally, within margin of error, it is all tied up.
 http://www.realclearpolitics.com/polls/ 

Obama and the Democrats still hold an edge in balance of power among the states, but it is shrinking. Rasmussen also reports increase in the Republican population following the GOP Convention.

Palin has definitely invigorated the Republican and conservative base and has made the difference. It remains to be seen if the malicious hate-bashing of her will have an effect in the home stretch. There are members here on A2K for instance who are posting thread after thread after thread sliming her and McCain with ANYTHING they can dig out of the most hateful blogs out there and are using thread titles full of innuendo. And yes, I have recoiled at some of the Obama thread titles too. And that merges into other blogs and the media keeping certain images at the forefront.

I think that kind of gutter politics is indefensible and I hope decent people reject it and I hope America still has more of a sense of decency than not. If we want the best people to run for high office, I think they at the very least deserve a fair and honest appraisal of their record.

But as I read this morning, this election will be determined not by issues or anything of any kind of substance, but will be based on image.

So what do you think. If they slime our candidates with all kinds of dishonest garbage, is it cricket to slime theirs with all kinds of garbage? If we believe that our candidate is the best choice for America, is it okay to do whatever it takes to win? One of our members earlier on this thread thought so.

What does everybody else think?
 
 
@Foxfyre,

 
Again you are free to smear and slime her as much as you wish, Cyclop, but it remains your opinion alone unless you have a credible source that disputes other sources posted.

@Foxfyre,

Okay Fox, here's the whole text of the CNN link you quoted:

 
JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- Some called it a bridge to the future. Others called it the bridge to nowhere.
art.alaska.ap.jpg

The canceled bridge would have connected Ketchikan, on the left, with Gravina Island, on the right.

On Friday, Alaska decided the bridge really was going nowhere, officially abandoning the project in Ketchikan that became a national symbol of federal pork-barrel spending.

While the move closes a chapter that has brought the state reams of ridicule, it also leaves open wounds in a community that fought for decades to get federal help.

"For somebody who touts process and transparency in getting projects done, I'm disappointed and taken aback," said state Rep. Kyle Johansen, R-Ketchikan. "We worked 30 years to get funding for this priority project."

U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens and Rep. Don Young, both Republicans, championed the project through Congress two years ago, securing more than $200 million for the bridge between Revillagigedo and Gravina islands.

Under mounting political pressure over pork projects, Congress stripped the earmark -- or stipulation -- that the money be used for the airport, but still sent the money to the state for any use it deemed appropriate.

Stevens spokesman Aaron Saunders said Friday the senator was interested in how the state ultimately used the money. A spokeswoman for Young said the congressman would have no comment.

Just last month, presidential candidate Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said pet projects could have played a role in a Minnesota bridge collapse that killed 13 people earlier this year.

"Maybe if we had done it right, maybe some of that money would have gone to inspect those bridges and other bridges around the country," McCain told a group of people in a town-hall style meeting in Ankeny, Iowa.

"Maybe the 200,000 people who cross that bridge every day would have been safer than spending $233 million of your tax dollars on a bridge in Alaska to an island with 50 people on it."

On Friday, Leo von Scheben, commissioner of the state Department of Transportation, said the bridge money could be used to build roads in Alaska.

"There is no question we desperately need to construct new roads in this state, including in southeast Alaska, where skyrocketing costs for the Alaska Marine Highway System present an impediment to the state's budget and the region's economy," von Scheben said in a statement.

The governor urged Alaskans not to dwell on the bridge.

"Much of the public's attitude toward Alaska bridges is based on inaccurate portrayals of the projects here," Palin said. "But we need to focus on what we can do, rather than fight over what has happened."
 

Where in there does it say that she 'angered' the Congressional delegation? I read the whole thing and didn't see that even implied, let alone 'clearly shown.' Can you point out which part says that? Unless you are talking about the quote from the State Congressman. Hahah. Hardly a problem there.

You don't spend much time looking into the fact that she fought for the earmarks for the bridge. She championed the project. She several times spoke in support of it. She spoke glowingly of how the 'federal delegation,' IE Young and Stevens, were going to get the money for the project. Then the project became unpopular. Then the national Republicans turned against it. They cut off the money for the project. Once it became clear that AK itself was going to have to pony up the 400 million or so, she dropped it. Not because it was fiscally irresponsible to build the bridge; but because she wanted the AMERICAN taxpayer to pay for it, not the AK ones. She didn't want it to come out of her budget.

There was nothing noble involved here, no 'lesson learned,' nothing. Just political expidiency. And that's not all that bad; as you've said above, that's common for politicians. But that's not how she and McCain presented it! They pushed it as some sort of winning issue, as if she personally turned down the bridge and stood up to wasteful spending! It was a complete and total lie, and you know it. They tried to position something she really had nothing to do with as evidence of her 'maverick' status. And it has blown up in their faces. Every news organization is carrying stories now of how she has been deceitful on the issue, and I guarantee that it doesn't help her or McCain to have been caught in this lie.

@Cycloptichorn,

If you can't see it in that article, Cyclop, I don't know what I could possible say to inform you. There is more in the other article I posted too.
 
 
@Foxfyre,

You could point out which actual words led you to the conclusion you said was obviously there. Please, I would like you to do so. You specifically said it was 'clearly shown.'

I think that the failure to highlight the fact that Palin pushed FOR the bridge and ran ON building the bridge really knocks a hole in your case, Fox. She was totally for it, before she realized she wasn't going to get it, and then decided to be against it. Some reformer.

@FreeDuck,

 
 
Again you are free to smear and slime her as much as you wish, Cyclop, but it remains your opinion alone unless you have a credible source that disputes other sources posted.

 

Is this really smear and slime, though? I thought this kind of stuff is what we should be discussing.

 

It is smearing and sliming to question her motives when there is nothing to determine that her motives were anything other than her statements or what has been reported re the bridge. We both agree that she is creating a false impression when she says she turned the bridge down without explaining why, but I can forgive her that as I have to forgive all politicians as they all seem to do it.
 
 
@Foxfyre,

 
I think that kind of gutter politics is indefensible and I hope decent people reject it and I hope America still has more of a sense of decency than not. If we want the best people to run for high office, I think they at the very least deserve a fair and honest appraisal of their record.
 

I certainly reject gutter politics, but I have to say I haven't seen much of it this year. I think both campaigns have been pretty good about not using character assassination to slime the other. I have not seen any Willie Horton ads, for instance. Nor have I seen McCain accused of having fathered biracial baby out of wedlock. I have seen some slime, but not coming directly from either of these campaigns. Remember the "terrorist fist jab"?

 
But as I read this morning, this election will be determined not by issues or anything of any kind of substance, but will be based on image.
 

So says McCain campaign manager:
 
"This election is not about issues," said Davis. "This election is about a composite view of what people take away from these candidates."
 

 
So what do you think. If they slime our candidates with all kinds of dishonest garbage, is it cricket to slime theirs with all kinds of garbage? If we believe that our candidate is the best choice for America, is it okay to do whatever it takes to win? One of our members earlier on this thread thought so.
 

I think that there has been very little actual slime but that the race is being hotly contested. I don't see why it would be anything else given what is at stake. When was the last time we elected a president who was not prepared to fight for it?
 
 
@Foxfyre,

Eh. Haven't you already conceded the point that her motives were not what she portrayed them to be? So it seems like questioning them was maybe a good idea. Or are you talking about some other motives?

 
We both agree that she is creating a false impression when she says she turned the bridge down without explaining why, but I can forgive her that as I have to forgive all politicians as they all seem to do it.

 
Fine. You can forgive her for it. But it's not slime to point out that she didn't tell the whole truth.

No, I have NOT conceded that her motives were not what she portrayed them to be. I conceded that she intentionally gave an incomplete impression of the facts in her rhetoric without lying about it. That is a different thing.

I have no problem with questioning motives when they are clearly misrepresented. That is not sliming.

I have no problem in analyzing relationships or involvement or words spoken or actions taken. That is not sliming.

I have a problem with manufacturing/making up motives when there is no basis for them and stating such made up motives as fact. I have a problem with trying to making a bigger deal out of something than it actually is. I have a problem with making up stuff about people or misquoting them or misrepresenting them in malicious ways. THAT is sliming.
 
 
@Foxfyre,

 
No, I have NOT conceded that her motives were not what she portrayed them to be.
 

 
So while she is technically correct that she turned it down, she may be stretching it as to her motives for doing so. (Imagine a politician doing that!)

@Cycloptichorn,

Cyclops, if the bridge is the biggest issue, it aint goin nowhere. I have long suspected the label "bridge to nowhere" was a label attached out of ignorance. Projects like this have a history, and they have reasons. So she was for it, but eventually said, to heck with it, we'll do it ourselves, if I read all of this correctly. So it sounds like she hasn't misrepresented what she did, she just left out alot of the details that led up to what she did. Not unusual for things in a speech. Again, if thats the best issue you have on Palin, good luck, as I don't think it amounts to a hill of beans.

Actually you aren't reading this correctly at all. She didn't say 'heck with it, we'll do it ourselves' at all. She was all for the American taxpayer to spend the money to build it. But when it became clear that wasn't going to happen, she didn't want to spend AK taxpayer money on it, for it would be coming out of her budget. So she decided she was against it. Not because it was a bad idea, not because she thought it was a waste of money - but because she wanted the Feds to pay for it and not her administration. In fact, she canceled it rather then pay for it herself.

This is the exact opposite of the way that she has portrayed it, and it's why every news org., including the WSJ and other Conservative news orgs, are calling her out on her lie. She didn't say 'to heck with it.' The national Republican party said 'you're not getting the money.'

You read it incorrectly. It's more that she said "What, we have to do it ourselves ? Forget it then."

To wit -- she tried to get the government to pay for the bridge, but after everything was said and done it was still about $400 million short, and Alaska would have had to pay for that themselves. At that point, the bridge thing tanked, and not just because of her. As in, she recognized it was over and ruefully acknowledged as much -- she was for it until then.

I don't have a huge issue with it in and of itself. I think the whole thing is pretty emblematic, though.

- McCain either didn't actually know her role before he chose her, or else contradicted what is supposed to be one of his bedrock convictions and a central campaign tenet (anti-earmarks) to choose an earmarker par excellence

- McCain either knowingly lied or was clueless when he made her "opposition" to the Bridge to Nowhere a central part of his introduction of her

- Palin and the McCain campaign CONTINUE to lie even though the untruthfulness has now been pointed out over and over again. It's pure brazenness.
 
 
@sozobe,

Absolutely. They are trying to brazen it out, and hell, it'll probably work, b/c the media is too cowardly to call them out on it fully. Obama needs to keep hitting the fact that they are liars, though.

The idea that Palin is some sort of anti-earmark warrior is a joke. AK rolls in earmarks and gov't spending. They are the biggest pig in America when it comes to pork spending. Palin actively worked to get her piece of the pie as mayor and then continued to do so as Governor. AK has requested tons of earmarks and spending this year. At what point has she learned that they are bad? The day that she was tapped by McCain?

What a joke

@Cycloptichorn,

On the same day that dozens of news organizations have exposed Governor Palin's phony Bridge to Nowhere claim as a 'naked lie,' she and John McCain continue to repeat the claim in their stump speeches. Maybe tomorrow she'll tell us she sold it on eBay," said Obama campaign spokesman Tommy Vietor.

Its the difficulty in communicating in this medium I think. I think were we face to face there would be far much less nitpicking of semantics because there would hopefully be more give and take allowed in how we express ourselves.

I believe it cannot be disputed that her motives for turning down the bridge was that it would be fiscally irresponsible to allocate as much state monies to build it as would be necessary. She most likely at some point did say 'I turned down the bridge from nowhere - if we want a bridge, we will build it ourselves' to somebody at some point. Her motive in the convention speech was to emphasize her fiscally conservative conscience. The statement was misleading, however, as it suggested that her fiscal conscience turned down the bridge in a way different from the way it actually happened. That was not a lie. It was a stretch. This was not to slime somebody else, however. It was a line intended to punch up her resume.

All politicians do it. I'm not condoning it, but they ALL do it.

It wasn't all that much different from her line about putting the government jet on Ebay. And she did. Just like she did turn down the bridge. Those not paying close attention to detail might think she was saying that she sold the jet on Ebay. She didn't, but neither did she say that she did. The plane was ultimately sold for a pretty good price. So was she misleading? Her critics say yes and they are trying to slime her with a Palin lie about that.

Those who accuse her of a flipflop on the bridge are being equally dishonest in not pointing out that she flipflopped only after the cost of the bridge had gone up substantially changing the funding equation considerably. Yes her position on it was a flipflop, but there were extenuating circumstances there that must be included to assess her motives for that flipflop with any kind of intellectual honesty.

It did give an impression different from the actual facts, but it was not a lie. It was a small and insignificant thing in the grand scheme of things.

I agree - but it's the McCain campaign that decided to make an issue of it, and she keeps repeating the lie in every speech, so they really have nobody to blame but themselves for all the attention paid to it.

Let's change gears; Palin had a horrible record as a 'fiscal conservative' when she was Mayor of Wassalia. She somehow managed to take a town with zero debt, get 27 million dollars in federal pork allocated to it - over 4k per citizen of the town of your and my money - and leave the town with a 20 million dollar deficit that they are still struggling with today. How did that happen, if she has a record as a fiscal conservative?

Be honest - it's not just the convention. She repeats the lie in every speech she gives, which, to be fair, is her convention speech done over again, as they haven't really rolled out any new material.

She said it AGAIN today. It's a continual pattern of lying on their part.

Sarah is no naive "small town mayor" - she just *started out* there. Btw, as Mayor of Wasilla, she brought this "small town" through a lot of GOOD changes and left it at the end of her term having grown to the 4th largest CITY in Alaska - a lot of growth and a stronger economic base than ever before. (Truth or Fiction Site)
 

New York Times

 
WASILLA, Alaska "" The world arrived here more than a century ago with the gold rush and later the railroad. Yet one aspect of American life did not come to town until 1996, the year Sarah Palin ran for mayor and Wasilla got its first local lesson in wedge politics.

The traditional turning points that had decided municipal elections in this town of less than 7,000 people "" Should we pave the dirt roads? Put in sewers? Which candidate is your hunting buddy? "" seemed all but obsolete the year Ms. Palin, then 32, challenged the three-term incumbent, John C. Stein.

Anti-abortion fliers circulated. Ms. Palin played up her church work and her membership in the National Rifle Association. The state Republican Party, never involved before because city elections are nonpartisan, ran advertisements on Ms. Palin’’s behalf.

Two years after Representative Newt Gingrich helped draft the Contract With America to advance Republican positions, Ms. Palin and her passion for Republican ideology and religious faith overtook a town known for a wide libertarian streak and for helping start the Iditarod sled dog race.

“Sarah comes in with all this ideological stuff, and I was like, ‘‘Whoa,’’ said Mr. Stein, who lost the election. ““But that got her elected: abortion, gun rights, term limits and the religious born-again thing. I’’m not a churchgoing guy, and that was another issue: ‘‘We will have our first Christian mayor.’’
“I thought: ‘‘Holy cow, what’’s happening here? Does that mean she thinks I’’m Jewish or Islamic?’’ ”” recalled Mr. Stein, who was raised Lutheran, and later went to work as the administrator for the city of Sitka in southeast Alaska. “The point was that she was a born-again Christian.”

For all the admiration in Alaska for Ms. Palin, her rapid ascent from an activist in the P.T.A. to the running mate of Senator John McCain did not come without battle wounds. Her years in Wasilla, her first executive experience, reveal a mix of successes and stumbles, with Ms. Palin gaining support from a majority of residents for her drive, her faith and her accessibility but alienating others with what they said could be a polarizing single-mindedness.

“She is an aggressive reformer who isn’’t afraid to break glass, to bring change to Wasilla and later to the state of Alaska,” said Taylor Griffin, a spokesman for the McCain campaign, who declined to address specific aspects of Ms. Palin’s tenure as mayor. “Washington needs some of that.”

In Wasilla, Ms. Palin is widely praised for following through on campaign promises by cutting property taxes while improving roads and sewers and strengthening the Police Department.

Her supporters say she helped Wasilla evolve from a ridiculed backwater to fast-growing suburb. The population of about 5,000 during her tenure as mayor has grown to nearly 10,000 now, and the city is filling with big box stores, including a Target that is scheduled to open on Oct. 12, one of three opening statewide that day in the chain’’s Alaska debut.
 

From this point the NYT brings in a lot more stuff, including negatives from their point of view, but nobody expects the NYT to give a positive assessment of any Republican.

@Cycloptichorn,

Religious community organizers work to repair a world torn apart by religion. Brilliant!
 
 
And re Obama's community organizer experience, the most fair and balanced investigative piece I could find was in the National Review - lengthy - runs three web pages - but it is constructive in dispelling some of the myths Obama's opponents have tried to weave around that as well as dispelling the impression spun from Obama supporters that it was much more than what it was.

It is constructive in looking into something of who Obama is, however:

Summary conclusion of the article:

 
Community organizing is just as essential in understanding Obama. But what does it say about him?

The first thing is that he has a talent for, well, organizing. Everyone who worked with Obama says he was good at the job. And he has used the techniques he learned in Chicago to organize his own presidential campaign, going so far as to enlist Mike Kruglik to help start a “Camp Obama” program to instill organizing principles into Obama supporters. The result is a campaign that even Obama’s opponents admit is a very impressive operation.

But Obama’s time in Chicago also revealed the conventionality of his approach to the underlying problems of the South Side. Is the area crippled by a culture of dysfunction? Demand summer jobs. Push for an after-school program. Convince the city to spend more on this or that. It was the same old stuff; Obama could think outside the box on ways to organize people, but not on what he was organizing them for.

Certainly no one should live in an apartment contaminated by asbestos, but Obama did not seem to question, or at least question very strongly, the notion that the people he wanted to organize should be living in Altgeld at all. The place was, after all, one of the nation’s capitals of dysfunction. “Every ten years I would work on the census,” Yvonne Lloyd told me. “I always had Altgeld. When you look at those forms from the census, you had three or four generations in one apartment " the grandmother, the mother, the daughter, and then her baby. It was supposed to be a stepping stone, but you’ve got people that are never going to leave.”

No doubt Obama would agree that that is a bad thing, but when a real attempt to break through that culture of dysfunction " the landmark 1996 welfare-reform bill, now widely accepted as one of the most successful domestic-policy initiatives in a generation " came up, Obama vowed to use all the resources at his disposal to undo it. “I made sure our new welfare system didn’t punish people by kicking them off the rolls,” he said in 1999. Two years earlier, he had declared: “We want to make sure that there is health care, child care, job training, and transportation vouchers " everything that is needed to ensure that those who need it will have support.” Obama applied his considerable organizational skills to perpetuating the old, failed way of doing things.

Obama’s professional colleagues, people like Jerry Kellman, believe his lasting accomplishment was to build an organization, the Developing Communities Project, that survived his departure. Today, DCP still exists, run out of a small Methodist church building on 95th Street, working on after-school programs, drug prevention, and voter registration. It has become, much more than it was when Obama was there, a grant-getting institution; according to tax records, about three-quarters of its funding comes from government grants, with the rest from liberal foundations like the Woods Fund, on whose board Obama sat from 1993 to 2002.

Has any of that brought about the change Obama spoke of back in 1985? Not in any large sense. But if Obama doesn’t have much to show for his years as an organizer, it’s fair to say that many of the people he touched revere him deeply. Remember what Loretta Augustine-Herron said: Obama had such a powerful presence that he made her believe he could do the job, even though there was little in his résumé to suggest he could. Does that sound familiar to anyone who has watched the Obama campaign? When hope is the product, Obama can sell it with the best of them.

When he left for law school, Obama wondered what he had accomplished as an organizer. He certainly had some achievements, but he did not " perhaps could not " concede that there might be something wrong with his approach to Chicago’s problems. Instead of questioning his own premises, he concluded that he simply needed more power to get the job done. So he made plans to run for political office. And in each successive office, he has concluded that he did not have enough power to get the job done, so now he is running for the most powerful office in the land.

And what if he gets it? He’ll be the biggest, strongest organizer in the world. He’ll dazzle the country with his message of hope and possibility. But we shouldn’t expect much to actually get done.

@Foxfyre,

 
Six years of her executive experience came as mayor of Wasilla, a city north of Anchorage that had about 5,000 residents when she took over. As much of Palin’s hometown rallies with pride around her, 1,400 miles away - in a National Archives warehouse in Seattle - three boxes of documents help capture the quality of her mayoral experience.

These records, from a federal wrongful-termination lawsuit, include the minutiae of municipal governance, with memos to administrators and personnel records stamped "confidential." The documents, combined with accounts from her hometown newspaper, show how Palin’s first year as mayor could easily have been her last.

[...]

After notifying the librarian that she was fired, Palin backtracked and decided to keep her on. Palin had twice asked this librarian what she thought about banning books, to which the librarian responded it was a lousy idea, one she wouldn’t go along with. Later, Palin told the local paper that any questions she’d raised about censorship were only "rhetorical."

 

Usually, I don't like the Boston Herold at all. But since it's a paper "from your side":

@Cycloptichorn,

There are millions of people working on behalf of churches, cyclops, most of which probably don't care about politics. And Obama's street organizing involved alot more than church work I think.

Anne Kilkenny, a Democrat who said she attended every City Council meeting in Ms. Palin’s first year in office, said Ms. Palin brought up the idea of banning some books at one meeting. “They were somehow morally or socially objectionable to her,” Ms. Kilkenny said.

The librarian, Mary Ellen Emmons, pledged to “resist all efforts at censorship,” Ms. Kilkenny recalled. Ms. Palin fired Ms. Emmons shortly after taking office but changed course after residents made a strong show of support. Ms. Emmons, who left her job and Wasilla a couple of years later, declined to comment for this article.

In 1996, Ms. Palin suggested to the local paper, The Frontiersman, that the conversations about banning books were “rhetorical.”

@Walter Hinteler,

 
WASILLA " In the wake of strong reactions from the city’s library director to inquiries about censorship, Wasilla Mayor Sarah Palin on Monday was taking pains to explain her questions about censoring library material were “rhetorical.”
…
Library Director Mary Ellen Emmons last week said Palin broached the subject with her on two occasions in October - once Palin was elected mayor Oct. 1 but before she took office on Oct. 14, and again in more detail on Monday, Oct. 28.
…
Palin said Monday she had no particular books or other material in mind when she posed the questions to Emmons.
…
But on Monday, Oct. 28, Emmons said Palin asked her outright if she could live with censorship of library books. This was during a weak when Palin was requesting resignations from all the city’s department heads as a way of expressing loyalty.
…
Emmons said Palin asked her on Oct. 28 if she would object to censorship, even if people were circling the library in protest about a book.
…
Palin called Emmons into her office Monday [12/14/1996] to discuss the censorship questions again.
…
Emmons said the current Wasilla policy, which she described as written in more general terms than the borough’s, also worked procedurally in a book-challenge case last year. Emmons said then-council-woman Palin was distressed about the issue when it came up, indicating she was aware of the city’s book-challenge policy.

Emmons said in the conversations with now-Mayor Palin in October, she reminded her again that the city has a policy in place. “But it seamed clear to me that wasn’t really what she was talking about anyhow,” Emmons added. “I just hope it doesn’t come up again.”

@okie,

 
There are millions of people working on behalf of churches, cyclops, most of which probably don't care about politics. And Obama's street organizing involved alot more than church work I think. I haven't researched it, but one thing I understand was Acorn, which is nothing more than a leftie group that registers voters, often times fraudulantly. Great experience, cyclops!

 

So you haven't researched it, but feel comfortable knocking it? I wouldn't be proud to admit that, myself.

According to news coverage at the time, the librarian said she would definitely not be all right with it. A few months later, the librarian, Mary Ellen Emmons, got a letter from Palin telling her she was going to be fired. The censorship issue was not mentioned as a reason for the firing. The letter just said the new mayor felt Emmons didn't fully support her and had to go.
Emmons had been city librarian for seven years and was well liked. After a wave of public support for her, Palin relented and let Emmons keep her job

But the situation calmed, and rather than being recalled, Palin was re-elected. She later acknowledged, "I grew tremendously in my early months as mayor."
 

I’m sure Palin screwed up plenty in her first months as Chief Executive. I certainly did when I, totally inexperienced, was hired as executive director of a large social service agency. I made a lot of stupid mistakes and I made enemies. And I got stuff right and I learned how to avoid a lot of mistakes and I grew in the job and made more friends than I made enemies. At least the board kept renewing my contract and giving me raises. And I’m proud of my accomplishments during my tenure as I am sure I Sarah is proud of hers. (I in no way had the magnitude or degree of responsibility in my job that Sarah had in hers as Mayor of Wasilla.)

Remember how Bill Clinton so disgusted the people of Arkansas that they threw him out as governor after one term? Stupid mistake after stupid mistake. He regrouped, reorganized, cleaned up his act and attitude, and ran again and had a long tenure as a quite successful governor.

We all do stupid stuff and have to regroup now and then.

Good, at least you can admit that I wasn't 'sliming' her.

I agree, Palin should be proud. She personally used a lobbyist to secure 27 million dollars in pork for her town. That's a record of accomplishment that she should highlight at every available opportunity, and it taught her the necessary lessons to do the same on the State Governor level. Bravo!

@Cycloptichorn,

Cyclop, when you ONLY pick out things that put her in a bad light and misrepresent those, it's sliming. Sorry, but it really is. It is sliming when our side does it and it is sliming when your side does it.

I suggest we all spend a little time and include any extenuating circumstances that might give a more accurate picture when we criticize our opponents.

Sorry Fox, you can't just make words mean whatever you want. Pointing out facts about someone isn't 'sliming' them. It's highlighting certain aspects of their record in a way designed to leave a certain impression, yes; but 'sliming' is an inaccurate term. To you, I guess it means we can't criticize Palin's actual actions while in office, unless we 'slime' her. Right?

Regarding the book incident... You lefties are just wrong about this.

 
 Not a Book Burner 
One false rumor accuses then-Mayor Palin of threatening to fire Wasilla's librarian for refusing to ban books from the town library. Some versions of the rumor come complete with a list of the books that Palin allegedly attempted to ban. The story is false on several fronts: Palin never asked that books be banned; the librarian continued to serve in that position; no books were actually banned; and many of the books on the list that Palin supposedly wanted to censor weren't even in print at the time, proving that the list is a fabrication.

It's true that Palin did raise the issue with Mary Ellen Emmons, Wasilla's librarian, on at least two occasions. Emmons flatly stated her opposition both times. But, as the Mat-Su Valley Frontiersman (Wasilla's local paper) reported at the time, Palin asked general questions about what Emmons would say if Palin requested that a book be banned. According to Emmons, Palin "was asking me how I would deal with her saying a book can't be in the library." Emmons reported that Palin pressed the issue, asking whether Emmons' position would change if residents were picketing the library. Wasilla resident Anne Kilkenny, who was at the meeting, corroborates Emmons' story, telling the Chicago Tribune that "Sarah said to Mary Ellen, 'What would your response be if I asked you to remove some books from the collection?' "

Palin characterized the exchange differently, initially volunteering the episode as an example of discussions with city employees about following her administration's agenda. Palin described her questions to Emmons as "rhetorical," noting that her questions "were asked in the context of professionalism regarding the library policy that is in place in our city." Actually, true rhetorical questions have implied answers (e.g., "Who do you think you are?"), so Palin probably meant to describe her questions as hypothetical or theoretical. We can't read minds, so it is impossible for us to know whether or not Palin may actually have wanted to ban books from the library or whether she simply wanted to know how her new employees would respond to an instruction from their boss. It is worth noting that, in an update, the Frontiersman points out that no book was ever banned from the library's shelves.

Moreover, although Palin fired Emmons as part of a "loyalty" purge, she rehired Emmons the next day, and Emmons remained at her job for two-and-a-half more years. Actually, Palin initially requested Emmons' resignation in October 1996, four days before the public discussion of censorship. That was at the same time she requested that all four of Wasilla's department heads resign. Palin described the requests as a loyalty test and allowed all four department heads to retain their positions. But on Jan. 30, 1997, three months after the censorship discussion, Palin informed Emmons and Wasilla's police chief, Irv Stambaugh, that they would be fired. According to the Chicago Tribune, Palin did not list censorship as a reason for Emmons' firing. Palin rehired Emmons the following day. Emmons continued to serve as librarian until August 1999, when the Chicago Tribune reports that she resigned.

So what about that list of books targeted for banning, which according to one widely e-mailed version was taken "from the official minutes of the Wasilla Library Board"? If it was, the library board should take up fortune telling. The list includes the first four Harry Potter books, none of which had been published at the time of the Palin-Emmons conversations. The first wasn't published until 1998. In fact, the list is a simple cut-and-paste job, snatched (complete with typos and the occasional incorrect title) from the Florida Institute of Technology library Web page, which presents the list as "Books banned at one time or another in the United States."

 

I know, I know... Factcheck.org must have it wrong. I mean after all, they are disagreeing with the liberal agenda!

She was threatened with firing yes, but it never actually happened.

I thought the part about Palin asking for her resignation BEFORE the book banning discussion came up was interesting though. First time I have seen that.
 
 
@Foxfyre,

Rush characterized the Dems push for finding dirt in Alaska as a hoard of people hanging out in bars, offering anybody with dirt on Palin some rewards for the info. ha ha, probably offered as a fun description, but perhaps not too far off the mark! Problem is her favorability ratings there, it must be tough sledding for the "investigative reporters?" Instead, those reporters have to ignore the 80% or so of the people that are mad at Palin in Wasilla for leaving and being governor, and now Alaskans are mad at Palin for trying to leave the governors office, ha ha.

Arkansas was probably so glad and overjoyed when Clinton left Arkansas, they were probably tempted to hold parades to mark the occasion.

Let's see, you said

 
Oh nah, she just asked the librarian how she felt about banning books, and when she didn't get the answer she like, she fired her; only to hear a giant outcry from her constituents, upon which she re-hired her.

Cycloptichorn

 

You obviously care about WHY she did it and you are wrong in the reasons. You will obviously put people that oppose you politically or challenge your beliefs in the darkest shadow every single time and you are wrong to do so.

Factcheck shows that Palin did indeed fire the librarian. At the same time she fired the Police Chief. She then rehired her the next day and she worked for several years after only to resign on her own.

It's ok to admit you are wrong on this. We all know anyways.
 
 
@McGentrix,

I like the way how it is seen by a Jewish source:I

 
In the spirit of Christian forgiveness, perhaps Sarah would now like to nominate Mary Ellen Baker, Wasailla’s librarian (yes, the one she tried to fire) for the I Love My Librarian Award.

@McGentrix,

And none of this strikes anyone on the McCain/Palin side as abuse of power? Heavy handedness? Your with me or your against me?

Palin fired the librarian and police chief to show she could, as a warning for them to get in line and support her. She sent the message that "your job is on the line if you don't d what I want."

Gee, that sounds awfully familiar. Certainly doesn't indicate any willingness to reach across the aisle or unite.
 
 
@squinney,

Yeah, the factcheck said it was part of a "loyalty purge". I'm not sure if that's better than censorship.
 
 
@squinney,

There's no doubt about it that Sarah did make a lot of mistakes in her early months on the job. She readily admits it. She learned. She grew. She got better. She left as a popular mayor as is testified by previous posts. Perhaps she should get some credit that she actually did learn some things on the job because she has some actual experience?

And maybe it is unfair to brand a perfectly acceptable policy of requesting resignations from existing appointees as "abuse of power"? In many organizations I have worked for, that has been a standard procedure with each new incoming executive. Bill Clinton fired everybody in the travel office, all US attorneys, and many others when he came into office. Was that an abuse of power?

 
 
 
@squinney,

Of course it doesn't indicate anything of the sort. Is that really what you want to judge her abilities on though? That she fired 2 department heads? Ignore everything else she did?

That seems really narrow minded and silly.

But, I doubt anything Palin could, would or did do would really matter though. She is againt the Obama ticket and she might as well be the devil incarnate.
 
 
@McGentrix,

Typical for you to assume I'm judging her abilities only on those two things and proceed to call me narrow minded and silly based on your wrong assumption.
 
 
So, with 2 months to go, where are we?

It's been long enough after the conventions that I'm comfortable saying that McCain's bounce has reached it's height, at least, his convention bounce has.

On the state polling level, not much changed since the conventions. The swing states are still swinging back and forth. Michigan has tightened up, but Obama maintains a lead there.

I use  http://www.pollster.com/  as my primary source of info, as they are relatively up-to-date and pretty non-partisan.

Counting the 'strong' states (which aren't going anywhere for either candidate) and the 'lean' states (which MOST LIKELY will not go anywhere for either candidate), the current electoral vote count stands at:

Obama 243
McCain 179
Toss-up 116

It's obvious that Obama is sitting in a good position right now. Here are the toss-up states, with their pollster.com graphs:

New Hampshire:

 

Michigan:

 

Virginia:

 

North Carolina:

 

Florida:

 

Ohio:

 

North Dakota:

 

Montana:

 

Colorado:

 

Finally, Nevada:

 

Not a bad showing from Obama in any of these swing states.

My recommendation for Obama would be to focus on MI and CO. If he wins those two, he wins the election. He only needs 26 out of the 116 toss-up EVs to win the election, and it seems that he has multiple paths to achieve that.

Some of this polling is out of date. I doubt Montana is within reach for Obama, though the fact that Ron Paul is on the ticket there now will help him considerably. I would bet my life that Obama will win Michigan, he's been ahead there the whole time and they're running plenty of ads there which are some of his best ads to date.

As for Colorado, it's hard to say. I think Obama can do it.

Unless we see a major shift in state polling by the end of next week, this election is Obama's to lose. At this point in 2004:

 

Obama is doing far better then Kerry, in terms of electoral votes, at this point in 2004. McCain has a huge hill to climb. In order to hit 270, he must win nearly every one of the 'swing states.' It's hard to overstate how overwhelmingly McCain will have to win.

Let's say that McCain wins all his current projected states, plus -

FL - 27
NC- 15
VA - 13
NH - 4
OH - 20
ND - 3
MT - 3
NV - 5

His electoral vote count would be at - 269, to tie with Obama. At that point the House of Representatives would decide and would declare Obama the winner.

Forget OH and FL; the true battlefield is in CO and MI. McCain cannot afford to lose either of those two states and still expect to win the election.

I know that it is. But the 'safe' states for both candidates are not going to change.

My conclusions still hold true: Colorado and Michigan are the keys to victory for Obama.

@Foxfyre,

My overall reading of this “Palintology” is that both Pailn as AK Governor and the Alaskan congressional delegation did their jobs regarding the “bridge thing”-- looking out for Alaskan citizens. This thread has brought out the facts of that issue and I can’t see where either Alaska’s Senator’s, Congressional Reps, or Governor didn’t fulfill their expected duties. Palin did everything I would expect a good governor to do. So I would expect that if and when McCain/Palin are the chief executives of the U.S. they would turn those same energies towards taking care of all U.S. citizens and for the overall good of the country. Indeed, McCain left the impression in his RNC speech he would endeavor to be the Anti-Bush and veto all the spending bills he possibly could. The other side, arguing for an Obama chief executive, likes to point to this episode and say “See, see! She’s just like our politicians who are accused of earmarks and excessive pork!” But the argument that: “every one does it” has little going for it.If anything this episode highlights the value of the stated Republican goal of smaller government.

But let’s leave this mole hill and talk about the mountains of foreign policy problems: Islamic terrorism, DPRK, Iran, and Russia. These issues I consider existential threats to the U.S. Al Qaeda and Islamic terrorist are still out there and are supported by Iran and,by proxy twice removed Russia (Russia sells arms to Iran and they have been reportedly found in both Iraq and Afghanistan). The agreement that the state department is trying to get thru regarding the DPRK is so watered down John Bolton is tearing his hair out trying, with article after article in the WSJ, to warn the American public that the Bush’s administration is trying to make a deal just so it can say it made a deal and fulfill some “legacy” requirements.

Iran is probably the biggest problem we have and has been caused by Europe’s and Russia’s refusal to stand with the U.S. and get tough with the Persians and by the Bush administration’s refusal, via Rumsfeldian myopathy, to countenance the power vacuum that might have been created by Saddam’s ouster. It would be a good thing if the Iranians could see the error of their ways before Israel feels compelled to solve the problem themselves. We should not let Israel put itself in this position. This is a tough problem that, like cheap meat, gets bigger the longer we chew on it.

Russia, flush with energy cash partially extorted from Europe and stolen from western oil companies (and even their own) is feeling its oats. Czar err… Prime Minister Putin senses an American weakness. The Georgia thing was planned by Russia and the decision to occupy fostered probably by NATO’s reluctance to fast track Georgia and the Ukraine membership into NATO. Additionally, the U.S. Missile deal with some Eastern European countries probably spiked Putin’s Pissed-Off meter also. I just read today Russia said it will send a naval squadron and planes to the Caribbean for joint exercises with, get this, Venezuela. Can you say “Cuban Missile Crisis “? Seems the U.S. is getting the big middle finger from both Hugo and Vlad the Impaler.

Given these worldly facts, who would you want in the White House? Well, Teddy Roosevelt, of course! But, he’s not available. But John McCain has warned and spoken out, not only on the “surge”, but on all the above. McCain has a record we can pick up, turn around in our metaphorical hands, and examine ad infinitum. This is in contrast to an initial ideological, some might say Freudian, reaction by Obama to talk with these people who mean us harm without initial preconditions. So we will have a Democratic foreign policy that is somewhat European and somewhat Robin Williams like: If they ignore our first warning we will warn them again, and if really necessary we will warn them again, again.

Don’t expect much cooperation from the Europeans for they have cold winters coming and are locked into energy agreements with the Russians. But other than ignorance of realpolitik and real world conditions, what is Obama’s excuse? In past posts I have been slammed for even suggesting that we should conduct foreign policy with realpolitik in mind, but, if the Old Soviet Union (Putin’s Russia) is going to play that game we must also.

Obama Says McCain Is Offering Fake Change: 'You Can Put Lipstick on a Pig, But It's Still a Pig'
September 09, 2008 6:10 PM

LEBANON, Va. -- "That's not change," Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., said of what Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., is offering.

"You know, you can put lipstick on a pig," Obama said, "but it's still a pig."

The crowd rose and applauded, some of them no doubt thinking he may have been alluding to Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin's ad lib during her vice presidential nomination acceptance speech last week, "What's the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull? Lipstick."

"You can wrap an old fish in a piece of paper called 'change,'" Obama continued, "it's still gonna stink after eight years.

"We’’ve had enough of the same old thing! It’’s time to bring about real change to Washington. And that’’s the choice you’’ve got in this election."
Obama added that "it is not going to be easy... John McCain has a compelling biography, you know Sarah Palin is an interesting story."

The crowd booed.

"No, she’’s new!" Obama said. "She hasn’’t been on the scene, you know, she’’s got five kids and my hat goes off to anybody who’’s looking after five. I’’ve got two and they tire Michelle and me out!"

@Foxfyre,

Fox:
Realpolitik- politics based on practical and material factors rather than on theoretical or ethical objectives

Attribution, for the most part, goes to Germany's Otto Von Bismarck's foreign policy. But, perhaps I should refine the term to:

Neo-Realpolitik-- Politics based on practical and material factors first with the ultimate goal of influencing other national governments to be sympathetic if not down right willing to convert to our system of government--Free Markets, Free Press, Democracy, and a strong Human Rights emphasis (our theoretical or ethical objectives).

Bismark recognized that a nation of theorists and philosophers with a governmental "Good Idea" was of no use if the nation they populated ceased to exist. The Nation comes first. God and ideology can be tolerated and squeezed in, but the Nation and its people must be protected. A strong military is implied

Perhaps it has gotten a bad name because of its origins or at least practice in Germany. But if the nation appears weak it will suffer mischief from its neighbors. Saddam understood this and this is why he wouldn’t’ tell anybody, especially his neighbors, he had destroyed his WMD. Saddam’s real problem was that he was, actually, weak.

We must not only appear to be strong we must actually be strong. The emphasis is on practical and material factors upon we must rely on to inform our real world actions. If Russia talks like a bully and acts like a bully we should treat it as such since that is the language it understands and respects. There is a lot we can do to force world banks to drop Russia as their clients. This would send a powerful message, after all it was economics that brought down the Soviet Union, not Allied or NATO tanks or missiles. Alternatively, keeping our economy strong is part of my concept of Neo-Realpolitik, its not just making life hard for other nations.

Fox, Thank you very much for the opportunity to explain, you are the first one to ask before just condemning the term.

JM

@JamesMorrison,

Thank you. I understand a bit better now I think.

In your previous post you say

 
But other than ignorance of realpolitik and real world conditions, what is Obama’s excuse? In past posts I have been slammed for even suggesting that we should conduct foreign policy with realpolitik in mind, but, if the Old Soviet Union (Putin’s Russia) is going to play that game we must also.
 

That is what many on the Left propose to do with Europe in general though; i.e. play the game the way THEY play it so far as universal social services and international relations go. They think we can win the respect of the Europeans by being more Europeans. A few think we can even win the hearts and minds of Islamic extremists by being nice to them.

And now you seem to suggest that we must play Russia's game to deal constructively with Russia.

I think we would agree that Obama is likely to play very nice with Europe and be their messiah as well as ours and would be agreeable to adopting many European methods in order to win even more of their favor. I think we would agree that he would not play the game as Russia plays it but would rather talk - talk - talk - and talk again.

So for me there is a disconnect here. Why should we conform the United States to be what anybody else thinks we should be?

Europe has much to commend it and lovely people there, but if I wanted to live as Europeans live, it would be a lot easier to just move to Europe. And I don't WANT to go through another cold war.

I'm pretty sure that McCain and Palin will most march to beat of their own drum. I'm pretty sure that Obama and Biden will not.
 
 
@Cycloptichorn,

 
On the state polling level, not much changed since the conventions.

 

Rasmussen poll on Montana today has McCain up by 11. SUSA poll from North-Carolina today has McCain up by 20 (!). Both McCain leads are larger than any recorded in the state before.

About North Carolina, even inveterate optimist Nate Silver says that, even if this poll is a bit of an outlier, it illustrates how Obama doesnt really have a chance of winning that state anymore. (Wasnt it you who a couple of months ago predicted Obama would?)

Less impressively but still noteworthy, Rasmussen and SUSA both have new polls out showing McCain leading by 2 in Virginia - the best he's done since May. Doesnt look out of reach for Obama, but it is a change.

Many other states have hardly been polled since the conventions. The pollster.com graphs, meanwhile, are deliberately very conservative in showing sudden changes in the race, and wont show the real impact of the Republican convention for a while.
 
 
@nimh,

Yes, I posted some up to date general poll averages earlier today on this thread, Nimh noting that overall it is statistically a dead even race as we go into the last eight weeks. Those state numbers are interesting though. We've been having a devil of a time getting up to date state polling and I'm just not flush enough with cash to buy Rasmussen's premium service where a lot of that information is found.
 
 
@Foxfyre,

Foxfyre, what do you think, I always thought Obama or McCain would either win or lose very narrowly. Until a month or two ago, I thought Obama would win narrowly, but I have the distinct feeling that he was beginning to lose even before the DNC. After the DNC, I thought he was falling, the RNC sealed it, Palin is another problem for them. Unless Palin flubs very badly, and I think it would need to be bad, I think Obama is toast, honestly, what do you think? If Obama doesn't reverse, he could be swamped very badly in November in a landslide loss. His amateurishness and ineptness is coming to the fore. Some of the stuff he says is pretty bad, a total flop, and I think people are waking up to it.

Yes. He has been so non-stop in his attacks on McCain and Palin the last seeral days that he and/or his surrogates are sounding shrill, frantic, and more than a little desperate. How long will it take his disciples to get tired of the incessant whining?

Two weeks ago had Obama said this: "You know, you can put lipstick on a pig," Obama said, "but it's still a pig." I would have easily accepted it as a simple figure of speech. This week, I am not at all sure he wasn't alluding to Palin in a snotty way and watching the You Tube clip of the audience reaction, I KNOW they took it that way. Every one of them would have gone ballistic if McCain or Palin said anything even possibly as offensive.

You're not sure if he was alluding to Palin but you know it was offensive?

Your statements just don't make sense Fox. This is like your attempt to make a journalist's words into an Obama attack. There is no there there so you are offended by what you think should be there.
 
 
@nimh,

 
 
On the state polling level, not much changed since the conventions.

 

Rasmussen poll on Montana today has McCain up by 11. SUSA poll from North-Carolina today has McCain up by 20 (!). Both McCain leads are larger than any recorded in the state before.

About North Carolina, even inveterate optimist Nate Silver says that, even if this poll is a bit of an outlier, it illustrates how Obama doesnt really have a chance of winning that state anymore. (Wasnt it you who a couple of months ago predicted Obama would?)

Well, I certainly don't think it was me who predicted Obama would win NC - I may have, but heck, I don't remember that, and I don't know much about NC so I couldn't tell ya. I think it's far more likely that he would win VA.

The Ras polls which have come out not only use a likely voter screen (which I never trust, as who the hell knows how they determine that?), they also only polled 500. Not exactly a trust-inspiring sample size. So I'm not too worried about that.

What I DO like, is that none of the 'safe' states for Obama has been polled as significantly changing; and the two that he needs to win, Michigan and Colorado, both have polled post-convention with Obama leads, albeit small ones.

That's all that matters, literally. If Obama can hold the safe states and win those two, McCain can have the rest. Of course, we will try everywhere, but the truth is that the election is still basically the same as it was before - MI and CO will be crucial.

It's not as if we expected the state polling to not move at all, during the period in the height of the Republican's convention bounce; for McCain to improve by a point or two is meaningless.

Ps, I know you don't trust the 20-point NC lead, lol, so why bring it up?
 
 
@Foxfyre,

Another dumb one, Obama talks about arresting suspected terrorists, and says:
"We may think this is Mohammed the terrorist, it might be Mohammed the cab driver. You may think it’s Barack the bomb thrower, but it might be Barack the guy running for president"

Question, is Obama losing it? Is the campaign fatique making him a bit goofy? What would possess him to say something that weird? Fact is, he does have a friend that was a bomb thrower. Was it another freudian slip, maybe he was thinking of his friend? I feel a little bad for Obama really, but he has caused alot of this stuff with his own track record, and with what he is saying. Why would he use himself as an example? I can't visualize a normal person doing that.

By the way, Palin and the McCain campaign got knocked around pretty much every single political talk show this evening, with specific discussion of troopergate, her lie about the bridge to nowhere, and her fear of media appearances.

I wonder how long the shine will last? My guess is a lot less then Republicans would like. It's hard to remember, but she was announced as the VP candidate less then two weeks ago!

@Cycloptichorn,

Because, as I already wrote in my post, "Nate Silver says that, even if this poll is a bit of an outlier, it illustrates how Obama doesnt really have a chance of winning that state anymore."

Here is what he wrote in full:

"A 20-point lead in North Carolina? Wow -- that's a big, shiny number. And it's probably an outlier to a certain extent, considering that Obama's numbers didn't appear to have suffered very much in neighboring Virginia. But even if it is a big outlier -- say Obama is really down 10 points rather than 20 -- and even if it's owing in part to the convention bounce -- say Obama rebounds to 5 points behind -- is there any way in hell that it's going to be a tipping point state? I think the answer to that is pretty obvious. The only reason for Obama to be maintaining a field operation in North Carolina is to help Kay Hagan."
 
 
@nimh,

Well, I wouldn't bet on it, but ya never know!

As to the other part of my post - the more important part - Obama's 'base' states seem to be doing okay, and don't seem likely to move. Of course, if McCain continues to gain, Obama will have bigger problems.

How many ways does he have to reach 269, the magic number?

1. Michigan, Colorado.

2. Michigan, Virginia.

3. Michigan, Ohio.

4. Florida.

5. Michigan, New Hampshire, Nevada.

6. Ohio, Colorado.

7. Ohio, Virginia.

8. Ohio, Nevada, New Hampshire.

9. Virginia, Colorado, New Hampshire.

10. Virginia, Colorado, Nevada.

McCain cannot let a single one of these scenarios happen. That's a tough defense to play.

@Cycloptichorn,

 Poll Shows Large Shift to McCain Among White Women 

This is a worst case scenario for Obama.
 
 
I think Obama blew it with his latest gaffe.
His comment about "putting lipstick on a pig" is gonna backfire on him.
Since Sarah Palin called herself a "pitbull with lipstick", his comments could be seen as sexist.

For the record, I do NOT think his comment was directed at or about Gov Palin, but I do think it was a very poor choice of words.
I have a feeling its gonna come back and bite him on the ass.
 
 
@mysteryman,

On the contrary, I think it is such a common expression, that when the McCain camp makes a big deal out of this they will appear overly sensitive and, dare I say it, playing the sexism card, not to mention a little bit egotistical. As if everything Obama says is about her.

"You're so vain
I bet you think this song is about you"
 
 
@FreeDuck,

I agree that it is a common expression.
But you know as well as I do that in politics its all about perception, so I think that more people will see it as an attack on Sarah Palin, when it clearly wasnt.

I think he should have thought about that before he said it, because he has handed the RNC more ammunition to use against him.
 
 
@mysteryman,

Maybe, but I still see the huge potential for blowback if they push this too much.

Immediately after her speech at the convention, I remember the commentators already saying that you can't use certain words (like "shrill") to describe her speech because it will be seen as sexist. Now we are supposed to stop using common expressions because she made a joke with the word "lipstick" in it. Some people might see this as being forced to be politically correct. Not to mention, Obama has been on the scene for a long time and has a reputation for being respectful and not attacking personally. For him to call her a pig would be so far out of character that it just doesn't seem plausible, even for those who don't support him.
 
 
@FreeDuck,

 
On the contrary, I think it is such a common expression...

 

Obama should have practiced the joke and really worked on his delivery.

Maybe he should stick to jokes about PORK being "the other white meat".
 
 
@mysteryman,

Obama has been saying alot of dumb things. Just a sampling. 57 states or whatever the number was. 10,000 people died in Greensburg, Kansas. He mentioned his Muslim faith -- freudian slip? One wonders. Then it was the pig thing. And also this when he was talking about arresting terror suspects and how we should treat them in the courts: "We may think this is Mohammed the terrorist, it might be Mohammed the cab driver. You may think it’s Barack the bomb thrower, but it might be Barack the guy running for president"
Why would he compare himself to a bomb thrower? Is that normal?

I haven't even done a search on the web for dumb statements, I am sure there are lots more. These are just ones I remember. And these don't count the many contradictions in regard to proposed policies. For example, now he is saying he would keep the taxcuts to stimulate the economy. This seems to be a totally republican policy, and has been demonized as a worthy tool to stimulate the economy by the Democrats for as long as I can remember, including him. Very confusing man.
 
 
@okie,

Saying stupid things and making gaffes didn't keep Bush from getting elected, now did it? Any time you have the press corps listening and recording every word of a person over the entire course of a campaign, they are bound to get some nice sound bytes of a candidate saying stupid things. You could make a tally of all the stupid things Obama ever said and compare it to all the stupid things McCain said. But that would be a waste of time because, face it, nobody cares. We are all adult enough to perceive a person's meaning even if they don't get the words exactly right.
 
 
@FreeDuck,

 
Obama Did Not Call Sarah Palin A Pig

09 Sep 2008 07:06 pm
The first McCain truthsquadding telephone call is taking place right now, and ex-MA Gov. Jane Swift is complaining about an idiom Barack Obama used today:

 
Obama poked fun of McCain and Palin's new "change" mantra.
"You can put lipstick on a pig," he said as the crowd cheered. "It's still a pig."
"You can wrap an old fish in a piece of paper called change. It's still gonna stink."
"We've had enough of the same old thing."
 

Suddenly, common analogies are sexist?

The McCain campaign has little respect for Obama, but they don't think he is stupid. And the only way one can conclude that Obama meant to refer to Gov. Sarah Palin as a pig is to have concluded that Obama is as dumb as a doornail.

Obama is fond of this particular phrase. To wit, in 2007:

 
'I think that both General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker are capable people who have been given an impossible assignment,' Sen. Barack Obama said yesterday in a telephone interview. 'George Bush has given a mission to General Petraeus, and he has done his best to try to figure out how to put lipstick on a pig.
 

And so is John McCain. Speaking about Hillary Clinton....

 
McCain criticized Democratic contenders for offering what he called costly universal health-care proposals that require too much government regulation. While he said he had not studied Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's plan, he said it was "eerily reminiscent" of the failed plan she offered as first lady in the 1990s.

"I think they put some lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig," he said of her proposal.

The McCain campaign is really working the refs hard. They've had some success already, why not continue? At some point it devolves into ridiculous whining, though, and I think they've gotten there.
 
 
@sozobe,

Actually, I don't think Obama meant to call Palin a pig. But it shows just how dense and how easy it is for him to fumble what he says. Pretty inept. He should have thought of that angle. Actually, I think there are bigger gaffes than this, example, Barack the bomb thrower, that was a dumb statement, sophomorish at best.
 
 
@okie,

I don't think so. I'm not eve sure what your beef is about the bomb thrower thing. It was pretty clear to me what his point was.

Given how much speaking he does every day, if all you've got is a handful of gaffes over the entire course of this campaign, I don't think you've got much. I mean, if he sang a song about bombing another country, you might have a point.
 
 
@okie,

Amazing how the people that promote "common sense" think that a common saying is suddenly "sophomorish."
 
 
@FreeDuck,

I dont know how old you are (and it isnt relevant) but there was a song in the early 1980's that was titled "Bomb Iran".
It was done by "Vince Vance and the Valiants" and was recorded during the Iran hostage crisis.

John McCain did NOT make up the song, so I fail to understand the outrage, real or not, about him using it.

That explains why the crowd whooped and hollered and rose to their feet when he said it. Changes the perspective doesn't it?

@parados,

Why do you feel Obama is not taking liberties or assuming airs beyond his station?
 
 
@H2O MAN,

The man went to Harvard and graduated magna cum laude. He is an elected US Senator. I would say he earned his present situation through intelligence and hard work.

Again. Let me ask YOU. What station is he assuming airs above?

You have yet to give me one, so I can only assume you are using the most obvious basis, the color of his skin.
 
 
@parados,

 
I can only assume you are using the most obvious basis, the color of his skin.

 

Then you are a racist!
 
 
@parados,

Well it is true, I heard it and its pretty hard to produce evidence for what you hear. Until we find a transcript of that speech with audience reaction, I will just have to go by what I hear. But consider this:

“Lipstick”, and “pitbull” are two words that have been associated with Sarah Palin since she made her now famous joke at the RNC Convention:

Do you know what the difference is between a hockey mom and a Pit Bull?” "Lipstick."

Since then, the analogy has been used by both campaigns “the Pit bull with lipstick" along with Sarah Barracuda. Columnists are writing sneering op eds with the terms. There are accounts of Obama supporters chanting “No Pit Bulls! No Pit Bulls” at his campaign rallies.

At an Obama campaign rally in St. Louis this week, MO Rep Russ Carnahan said: “For all his tough talk [McCain] buckled to the right wing of his party in his choice. Picked someone with zero experience in national government, zero experience in foreign affairs. There’s no way you can dress up that record, even with a lot of lipstick.”

And via The Politico, in Lebanon, VA:

Obama poked fun of McCain and Palin’s new “change” mantra.“You can put lipstick on a pig,” he said as the crowd cheered. “It’s still a pig.”“You can wrap an old fish in a piece of paper called change. It’s still gonna stink.” “We’ve had enough of the same old thing.”

Did Obama called Sarah Palin a pig? His supporters certainly took it that way.

Is it possible that the Obama campaign would be so careless and naive and use the "lipstick and pig" thing and believe it would not be seen as a juvenile put down of Sarah Palin?

Many including Ben Smith, Mike Huckabee, and others have been quick to point out that Obama didn’t call Sarah Palin a pig. And he didn’t in so many words.

But, given the history leading up to the rally yesterday, is it possible that the Obama campaign would be so careless or naive as to use the word, lipstick and “pig”, and believe it would not be seen as a juvenile put down aimed at Governor Palin?

Michelle Malkin thinks the “pig” part of the joke was meant for Sarah, and the “old fish” part was meant for McCain. If it was, Obama cuts another notch in his hypocrisy sign. If it wasn't, Senator Obama must really really not be as bright as his disciples want him to be.
 
 
@Foxfyre,

What a bunch of horseshit. I really hope the McCain camp does keep pushing this stupid issue. The national reporters clearly think it's stupid and it just makes McCain look asinine and childish.

Yaknow, he is proving himself more and more completely unfit to hold office. Between this idiocy and the truly perverted 'education' ad that the McCain camp put out, a sick, sick ad that makes Willie Horton look like a joke, they've sunk to complete asshole status. Seriously. I'm disgusted with the McCain camp today.

There's nothing to rebut. Obama used a common phrase, and one which has been used many times in the past by McCain himself, on one occasion in reference to Hillary Clinton. This whole thing is manufactured bullshit and you know it.

The completely reprehensible 'education' ad by McCain, on the other hand is sick and perverted and you should feel ashamed to even be a part of someone who would put something like that on the air. Truly.

The history is verifiable. Given how the pittbull versus lipstick thing has been played constantly in the media, if you think Obama should not have been sensitive to how lipstick on a pig would be interpreted by both his supporters and his opponents, you are as bad as Obama. He was naive or dumb or intentionally insulting. Take your choice.

@Foxfyre,

Here's Chuck Todd on your idiocy, Fox -

 
*** A different kind of political pork: Anyone else thinking that the McCain campaign -- who earlier this summer accused Obama of playing the race card -- is laughing at how easily they were able to bait some in the media to bite on this faux “lipstick on a pig” controversy? It's amazing the McCain campaign's ability right now to drive the talking point of the day (especially with Drudge and the tabloids), allowing them to win news cycle after news cycle. Any day the campaign is not about Bush, not about the economy, not about the fundamentals of this environment that make this an election favoring the Democrats is a good day for the McCain campaign. We'll see how easily the media takes the bait today on this McCain Web ad, which clearly distorts Obama’s line from yesterday. Conservative bloggers will pretend to be outraged and help drive this storyline today. Obama senior adviser Anita Dunn responded to the faux controversy with this statement: "Enough is enough. The Mc Cain campaign's attack … is a pathetic attempt to play the gender card about the use of a common analogy - the same analogy that Senator McCain himself used about Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's health care plan just last year. This phony lecture on gender sensitivity is the height of cynicism and lays bare the increasingly dishonorable campaign John McCain has chosen to run." Will Dunn's statement have the same effect that the McCain campaign's "enough" statement had on Team Obama regarding race?
 

He was neither naive, dumb, or intentionally insulting. You are merely practicing the politics of Faux outrage. In fact, I'm going to start referring to you as Fauxfire until you quit, because this is childish and stupid, fox.

The worst part is that you Republicans complained about the Dems doing this for years - until you have a female candidate. Now it's 'sexism! Sexism everywhere!' I don't care how you want to falsely interpret the statement, I highly doubt anyone is going to give a damn about such a stupid thing. And truly, what you and McCain are trying to do is exactly what Chuck Todd says: keep the conversation away from Bush and how close both McCain and Palin are to his idiotic and warmongering ways.

I pray to jeebus that Obama doesn't take the bait and apologize, Fauxfire. I hope he gets angry and lays into your idiot candidates. And I hope he brings up the extremely low morals of one who would run commercials about Obama and sex and little kids. F*cking sickening, and I'd love to hear you try to defend it, Faux.

2. Rising to their feet after the "lipstick" comment.

Me too. I took Foxfyre's word for it, but that would make all the difference on this gaffe. It would show intent, or probably no intent.
 
 
@okie,

Yup. Cyclop posts yet another unlinked source to change the subject and/or play the 'whose is blackest?' game again which seems to be the only defense they have these days.  

I honestly can appreciate how the Obama-ite disciples want to defend him and make everything okay. But the guy is a walking gaffe machine who is so clearly revealing his weaknesses in his subject matter and demonstrating that he isn't the wonderful nice guy they want him to be. He can still win in November.

But I think those of us who are absolutely certain he is the wrong man for the job cannot let this stuff slide. We need to keep pointing out what we know and see and our impressions and defend our candidates with something substantive. That will be our best shot since Obama doesn't have a whole lot of substance going for him.

What 'stuff' can't you let slide, Faux? Surely you know that Obama was using a common phrase. Surely you can agree that Republicans have been deriding Dems for the politics of victimhood for a long time; have you given up on that?

You don't have anything substantive to defend McCain and Palin on; that's why you focus on stuff like this. It's like you live in a parallel universe, really.

Cycloptichorn

ps, the 'who is blackest game?' From the people who brought you 'Clinton did it!' as the universal defense? You're a hack, Faux, seriously.

Also, Obama is a black man, are you calling him a n*gger? I know, it's a common phrase, but you KNOW he's black, so you must have meant to be insulting. I'm reporting your post for racism, racist.
 
 
Obama today was quite deriding of this Faux scandal, speaking about how this is just another part of the same ol' Republican playbook: McCain desperately doesn't want to talk about jobs and the economy, but instead stupid stuff. He was quite cutting.

Closing line -

We know Barak spoke for at least a minute prior to his lipstick comment in which there was no chanting about "pit bulls."

@mysteryman,

I won't link to it. But it basically claims that Obama's only legislative work dealing with education is a bill to teach sex education to kindergartners. The bill was ACTUALLY to teach them about inappropriate touching, in order to keep sexual predators at bay. The ad is offensive and highly misleading, not to mention inappropriate in the extreme.

Fucking disgusting behavior by the McCain campaign and they should be ashamed of it.

It takes his support for "age appropriate" sex education meant to protect children from sexual predators (by teaching them what are appropriate and inappropriate touches) and charging that he wants to teach the birds and the bees to kindergarteners.
 
 
@FreeDuck,

 
 
We need to keep pointing out what we know and see and our impressions and defend our candidates with something substantive. That will be our best shot since Obama doesn't have a whole lot of substance going for him.

 

Clearly he does have substance, as evidenced by the fact that the McCain campaign (and you) only wants to talk about their fake outrage at Obama using a common analogy. The horrors! If he did not have substance, you all might actually be talking about issues. But why talk about issues and have an actual debate (that you might lose) when you can instead cry sexism and media bias.

 

That's all I want to talk about? That's all you guys WILL talk about. I offered a discussion on taxes and economic policy. It was ignored. I offered a discussion on health care and nobody was interested in the nitty gritty on that. YOUR side continued to take slams at Bush, the GOP, McCain, and Palin and had no interest in defending Obama's position on anything. So, other than occasional diversions with the polling data, we're back to defending and countering the stupid stuff.

I would sincerely appreciate and welcome an offer of a discussion of a substantive issue from your side of the aisle. Please pick one and get us started.
 
 
@okie,

 
Me too. I took Foxfyre's word for it, but that would make all the difference on this gaffe. It would show intent, or probably no intent.

 

I am just going by what I heard our local radio commentators talking about this morning and I believe somebody mentioned it also last night. I haven't been able to find a transcript of the speech including audience participation--Huffington Post usually posts transcripts of Obama speeches but has sort of omitted this one so far at least as of earlier this morning. If it happened, it would have been before the YouTube clip kicks in. If you google "No pitbulls, no pitbulls' though, you will see that this is a chant given at Obama rallies since the GOP convention.
 
 
@Foxfyre,

 
“John McCain says he’s about change, too " except for economic policy, health care policy, tax policy, education policy, foreign policy and Karl Rove-style politics,” Mr. Obama told his supporters here. “That’s just calling the same thing something different.”

With a laugh, he added: “You can put lipstick on a pig; it’s still a pig. You can wrap an old fish in a piece of paper called change; it’s still going to stink after eight years.”

In the latest sign of the campaign’s heightened intensity, Mr. McCain’s surrogates responded within minutes and called on Mr. Obama to apologize to Gov. Sarah Palin for the lipstick remark. But to those in the audience, it was clear that Mr. Obama was employing an age-old phrase " lipstick on a pig " and referring to Mr. McCain’s policies. He had not yet mentioned Ms. Palin at that point of his speech.

@sozobe,

And today:

 
This happens every election cycle. Every four years. This is what we do. We've got an energy crisis. We have an education system that is not working for too many of our children and making us less competitive. We have an economy that is creating hardship for families all across America. We've got two wars going on, veterans coming home not being cared for -- and this is what they want to talk about! This is what they want to spend two of the last 55 days talking about.

You know who ends up losing at the end of the day? It's not the Democratic candidate, It's not the Republican candidate. It's you, the American people. because then we go another year or another four years or another eight years without addressing the issues that matter to you. Enough.

I don't care what they say about me, but I love this country too much to let them take over another election with lies and phony outrage and swift-boat politics. Enough is enough.
