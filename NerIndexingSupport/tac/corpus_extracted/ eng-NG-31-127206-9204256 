B-Rod (Boras-Rodriguez)  finally achieves headlines during the World
Series ...... of course NOT on the field.
Yankee fans not feeling good ...what a week!! They see Red Sox win
ANOTHER WS , see Joe Torre turn down a contract and watch B-Rod  take
his Brinks truck and ride off into the sunset.

What next for the Tankees?  Hank names himself manager? Girardi turns
down managers job and signs with Japanese team? Clemens says he'll
re-sign only if he can  have his own dugout seperate from the rest of
the team?  Jeter demands Tankees trade for another "boy-toy" now that
B-Rod is gone? Giambi annouces he is having a sex-change operation after
realizing his HGH use is causing him to grow "man tits"?
