It seems John Quincy Adams was way ahead of his time.

The sixth U.S. president was fond of making one-line-a-day entries in his diary. A student visiting his archives noticed how similar those entries are to today's Twitter updates, which are limited to 140 characters.

Starting Wednesday, the Massachusetts Historical Society will tweet daily doses of Adams' trip to Russia as U.S. minister 200 years ago. The tweets -- taken verbatim from his diary -- will include his favorite reads, memorable meals, weather and the daily drama of months at sea.

Librarians and historians at the society say they hope to connect a new generation with Adams by bringing his life into the 21st century.
