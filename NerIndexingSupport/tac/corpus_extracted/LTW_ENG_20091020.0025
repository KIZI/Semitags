WASHINGTON -- The White House last week announced that President Obama
had selected Jessie Roberson, a nuclear expert and senior vice president of
environmental affairs for the Atlantic Sea Island Group, to be a member of
the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board. The bio notes her previous
jobs, even her undergraduate degree in nuclear engineering.

Name sounds familiar. Roberson, Roberson: Wasn't she Dubya's appointee
as assistant secretary of the Energy Department for environmental
management, the $6 billion-a-year weapons cleanup program? That's not
mentioned in the White House release, but she was there from 2001 to
2004.
