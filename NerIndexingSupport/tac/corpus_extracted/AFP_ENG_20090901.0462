Philippine government negotiators are to meet representatives of communist
insurgents this week in an attempt to revive stalled peace talks, the chief
government negotiator said Tuesday.

The communist National Democratic Front (NDF) has threatened to abandon the
peace effort, which Norway offered to host, unless the government freed jailed
communist guerrilla leaders. The military opposes this demand.

"Before the meeting in Oslo, Norway on September 5, the government and the NDF
legal teams should talk first here in the Philippines to fix the legal issues,"
government negotiator Avelino Razon told reporters.

He did not say when these informal talks would take place but remarked that they
would focus on the NDF's key demand.

Razon said the detainees could not be easily freed as they were facing criminal
charges. "We are talking to many judges," he stressed.

"We have bent over backwards to accommodate the demands of the NDF so we expect
that they will show some confidence-building measures," he added.

Communist insurgent leader Jose Maria Sison said, in a statement issued from his
self-imposed exile in the Netherlands, that both sides can "discuss legal
possibilities" in Manila before the September 5 meeting.

"But there is no substitute for the soonest possible meeting of the (government)
and the NDF negotiating panels together with their respective lawyers in Oslo,"
Sison said, stressing that only the principals were authorised to conclude
agreements.

Military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Romeo Brawner, meanwhile, stressed that
the armed forces would continue to "address threats to security" posed by the
NDF's guerrilla arm, the New People's Army (NPA).

He said that while the military supported the peace effort, "the NDF must not
insist on releasing their members as a pre-condition to peace talks."

Peace talks with the NDF and its 5,000-strong NPA have been suspended since 2005
after the government refused to ask the European Union and the United States to
remove them from their foreign terrorist watchlist.

In July, the rebel group, which has been waging a 40-year Maoist campaign to
seize power, said it was open to resuming talks with the government but said
later the government must first release several captured communist leaders.
