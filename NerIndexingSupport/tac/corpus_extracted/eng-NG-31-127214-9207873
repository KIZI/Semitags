Williams Out for Season After 6 Carries

Ricky Williams' latest comeback lasted one game. The Miami Dolphins
running back will miss the rest of the season with a torn chest
muscle, according to his agent, Leigh Steinberg.

Williams was hurt Monday at Pittsburgh, when he played in his first
game in nearly two years. He returned following a 1 1/2-year
suspension for his latest violation of the NFL drug policy.

Steinberg said the arm will be in a sling from four to six weeks and
the rehab will take five months.

But Steinberg said Williams expects to be ready for next season.

"It's sad given how hopeful Ricky had been about his return to
football and given the amount of effort Ricky had put into his
rehabilitation. But he's optimistic and hopeful for the future."

With a winless record, the Dolphins were desperate for help and eager
to showcase Williams in hopes of increasing his trade value. Coach Cam
Cameron decided to play Williams only a week after he joined practice.

"My No. 1 concern coming into the game, when you hurry a guy back,
obviously he could get hurt," Cameron said after the game.

The team was off Tuesday, and a spokesman for the Dolphins said they
had no comment on Williams' status. Miami is 0-11 and plays the New
York Jets on Sunday.

Williams was injured in the second quarter Monday on a play when he
fumbled. After being tackled, he was accidentally stepped on while
chest-down on the ground.

Williams left the game, returned briefly and departed for good after
one more carry. He finished with 15 yards in six carries, and the
Dolphins lost 3-0 on a last-minute field goal.

Miami running back Jesse Chatman sat out the second half with a neck
injury, and his availability for the Jets game is in doubt. The
Dolphins' other running backs are Patrick Cobbs and rookie Lorenzo
Booker.

The Dolphins lost starter Ronnie Brown for the season to a knee injury
last month.

Williams, the 2002 NFL rushing champion, has played in only 13 games
since retiring in the summer of 2004. He has tested positive for
marijuana at least four times since the Dolphins acquired him in 2002,
and their franchise-record playoff drought began that same year.

Williams hasn't missed an NFL game because of an injury since 2000
when he was with the New Orleans Saints.

You could almost have predicted that this was going to happen.  Not
because it was in such bad conditions, but because it was Ricky
Williams and the Miami Dolphins were depending on him to help them.

And he only had three days of practice. How could he get into football
shape?

Do you think that just having completed the CFL season might have
gotten him into playing condition?

Plus, that *accidental* stomp on his shoulder blade was as accidental as
gang rape.

Does playing a complete CFL season put you in condition for a
dislocated shoulder when someone steps on the arm?

He didn't play in the CFL this year. They wouldn't allow him to. They
changed the rule at the end of last season that a player under
suspension in the NFL could not join a CFL team. His last game played
was in October or November 2006. It might have been earlier. For some
reason I have it in my head that he got hurt last year too and missed
a good chunk of the last part of the CFL season.

I must be wrong.  I cannot find anything that says one way or another
but I don't see him in any statistics for this year.  Sorry about that
Skep.
