How would feel, what would you do, and what would you say if the BNP was in charge of Britain, i.e. they become the new Government.

Discuss your views.
 
 
Well I'd surely not wear a kippur.
 
 
Disappointed in the population of Britain for voting them in. I'd probably emigrate out of the country.

But we are more likely to see a coalition of Conservatives and Labour before they even got close to claiming power...............which shows how likely this is.
 
 
I'd emigrate immediately before I was lynched.

Actually **** that, that's for pussies. I'd turn into V and go around destroying the fascist scum.
 
 
Immediate revolution I guess. Man that would be horrendous

Well seeing as they were voted in, I doubt there would be a revolution.

Low turnout, or people voting as a joke/out of ignorance?
 
 
I would start to treat the news as comedy, as any time the BNP were mentioned we would get lots of laughs. Unlike now when all you hear is BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD.
 
 
i'd have some blowing up to do
 
 
Time for the daily BNP bashing thread. Yay.

Ok, I'm no fan of the BNP, but let's face it... They couldn't do a lot worse than Neu Arbeit...

Arbeit macht unfrei...

I guess it's a tossup between the BNP's voluntary repatriation for all non-whites, or New Labours dedication to erasing the rights of the indigenous population, the police, the health service, the Armed Forces et al, ad nauseam...

Hmm I guess. Don't think that the BNP would ever be unintentionally voted in though (as in 'joke votes' - bearing in mind how many labour/conservative voters that go out to vote for their party whatever their policies are etc)

Why, what were you expecting? I like the smiley in your sig, by the way, I couldn't agree more!

At the end of the day, I'd probably take on the government too - all I was saying is, I don't particularly see them as more of a threat to Britain than the current bunch of jokers...

Well your post indicated that the BNP would stick up for this "indigenous population". They wouldn't though.

They would be advocating the rights of white people in Britain, whom they deem to be indigenous, of course the neglect the fact that most British people have German, French and even Scandinavian ancestry. Heck the Queen can hardly be called "indigenous"

I think that Labour is erasing the rights of the British people. I think Labour put the wants and demands of the minorities above the majority. I also think the BNP are a bunch of closet (or not so closet in some cases!) racists, xenophobes and generally abhorrent individuals... So what? I even agree with some of Labours statements/policies, but does anyone immediately jump up and accuse me of being a communist? (Which on here doesn't appear to be viewed as negatively as it's opposite... Funny that)

Really? Well, that'll teach me to go assuming without reading the minutiae of the BNP's policies... Can I go on their website and do that without being accused of supporting them? Is that allowed?

Oh well, if they'd be against the Queen then thats another matter entirely... I love ol' Liz the Boss, God bless her!

The BNP is abhorrent but many of their policies do appeal to white voters disenfranchised both Labour and the Conservatives.

Well you should go on their website and read their policies if your going to comment on the policies......

And no they are NOT against the Queen, I am pointing out their hypocrisy. They talk about "indigenous population" when Britain is made up of many different peoples originating from all over Europe (and further afield). You cannot simply say that someone is indigenous because they are white, and then say someone is not indigenous because their skin is black, when their ancestors could have immigrated into the country at the same time, or even be related!

Well, we're in agreement there. All of the ill-informed comments (especially from Democracy - you ****) aside (and including my own   )

I still don't see the BNP as more of a danger to the UK than New Labour. From what I've seen, and experienced, there's not a lot you can say that will convince me of that. Once again, it's not because I'm Nick Griffin's lovechild, it's because I don't think the policies of either are healthy for this country.

Lol.

You know that there are many divisions in europe, Germanic peoples vs the Slavs.

You can't talk about history about 'Europeans' being some sort of airy fairy loving family.

Europe, until the advent of America (who usurped the position), was one of the most backwards places on earth. As soon as the Roman Empire Empire collapsed it was absolute anarchy, social and technological regression, Europeans could hardly be called superior to anyone  . I mean lets face it, China (and even the Islamic world!!) was always technologically superior (in the very least) than Europe up until VERY recently, had it not been for a few unfortunate events taking place that halted this they probably would never have left this position.

Racial 'power' is a ridiculous concept anyway, only insecure people need to assert their 'superiority' over others   And if they are insecure they must know that they are not superior in some way

East Asia did it.

In fact Africa did it, Egypt, Pyramids (plus their temples and monuments) > any classical European construction considering the available technology of the time.

Babylon, Jordan (city of petra) middle east.

You really should do your research before making such silly comments

It supposed to mean that they are a technological marvel, and extremely sophisticated for the time they were built.

Technology advances from building on past discoveries. Considering the pyramids, sphinx and various other temples in Egypt were built around two-three thousand years before Europe begun 'advancing'. It is quite an accomplishment.

And saying that Europe is the only place that did things (As the person I quoted said) is utterly ridiculous. In essence it's not really about being better (that was my personal opinion).

And? ~4,000 years ago Europe was below primitive in comparison to Egypt  . It's not about the time. It was the assertion by the person that I quoted that Europe is the only place that has accomplished anything.

How about waiting to see what differences their policies made before shouting off about revolution and civil war? They are a political party you know, not insane raging racist killers. They have more changes they would like to make than just going around re-creating the Holocaust.

Additional- Don't assume I'm a BNP supporter or racist or whatever for this point. I'm merely saying this after doing a lot of research on extreme right politics in Britain and France for a French project, and if there's one thing I learned it's that they have other concerns for the country other than ONLY immigration, and I think more people need to rememebr that and not just assume they are clueless, thuggish Nazis.

Indeed.

Most (note most not all) 'modern' inventions are just sophisticated old ideas that have been improved upon by Europeans due to the fact that they enjoyed relative prosperity at the right time...

Heck we wouldn't even have guns (main reason for the European dominance..) if it wasn't for chinese gunpowder.

The Chinese invented gunpowder and the printing press.The Indians invented the decimal system.The Arabs and the Persians preserved many of the classical texts and made their own discoveries,while Europe, after the collapse of the Roman Empire,was comparatively in the Dark Ages,.

Europe has literally made the modern world, everything in it, the dominance there is incomparable.

In fact Europe has been largely the most tachnologically advanced place in the world from roman times on, and before that is was the middle east. Arguing that Europe hasn't been the most modern/civilised place since the Romans is sophistry, every since the middle ages Europe has been lightyears beyond the rest of the world.

Never said it didn't. It couldn't have done it without 'borrowing' the rest of the worlds inventions though.

making the assertion that Europe created everything and is the only place to have ever done anything utterly redundant.

I'm sorry but that's just plain wrong. There is a MAJOR period called the Dark ages, you know when Europe pretty much shrivelled up and died because of the collapse of the Roman empire.

The Islamic world on the other hand weathered the collapse, even embraced it and kept most of the roman knowledge. In fact if they hadn't we would have lost the majority of roman knowledge due to the fact that the religious dogma of europe sought to BURN books.

No it really hasn't. China, apart from a brief blip (which it is now hastily correcting) has always been more advanced than Europe, technologically at the -very- least.

China discovered the Americas before Europe. They just decided not to settle there.

Whilst there is no doubt European culture is the backbone of modern society, contesting that they are the prime source of technology, sophistication or even civilisation is a ignorant statement to make.

They just drop off into nihilism 'culture is realitive', 'they all have their good and bad points' ect.

In my mind when no obvious better sucessor has been propsed to the ways which have consistently lead too success we should keep on the original path. And that, untill the 50-60's was what people did, even the Americans considered themselves very much Christian and European, and so did we and most of the European countries.

*sigh* idiot, when you speak of Europe I'm sure you're not referring to Ukraine or Slovenia either. You are primarily referring to western europe, the UK, France, Germany, Italy, etc. And that wasn't my point you tool, my point was that up until the invention of the printing press (which had already existed in china 400 years before Europe), Europe was doing sweet **** all except enduring ignorance brought on by the Church. The Middle East and Asia weren't.

It really isn't that simple. Society in the 50-60s was very much more racist and inward looking - that isn't a good thing.

I'm sorry but that's just plain wrong. There is a MAJOR period called the Dark ages, you know when Europe pretty much shrivelled up and died because of the collapse of the Roman empire.

The Islamic world on the other hand weathered the collapse, even embraced it and kept most of the roman knowledge. In fact if they hadn't we would have lost the majority of roman knowledge due to the fact that the religious dogma of europe sought to BURN books.

No it really hasn't. China, apart from a brief blip (which it is now hastily correcting) has always been more advanced than Europe, technologically at the -very- least.

China discovered the Americas before Europe. They just decided not to settle there.

Whilst there is no doubt European culture is the backbone of modern society, contesting that they are the prime source of technology, sophistication or even civilisation is a ignorant statement to make.

 

Ha ha ha, go and tell your history teacher that and watch him laugh a gooden. I don't even know where to start, I can't be botherd tbh, what you're saying is pure sophistry.

Even during the 'Dark ages' (a term which is no longer in common academic usage) Europe was still producing some of the worlds most important discoveries, such as the printing press invented in Germany. Even the Islamic renisance or golden age doesn't match to what the Greeks and Romans where doing in Classical antiquity.

And the whole 'they invented it first' arguement is absurdity when talking about civilisations. The printing press undoubtably borrowed from Chinese printing blocks, but it was the German and European monestries and universities which where at the time advanced enough in organisation and advancement to have a book culture.
I suppose Africa is the most culturally advanced place in the world beacuse they invented agriculture first?  

Also judging a civilisation, a cultural entity by purely technology is just wrong. Culture is much more than just advancement, it is a certain way at looking at science, art ect.
 
 
Do you know any history, whatsoever?

Nice try sport, but the European printing press was invented in the 1400s. The dark ages ended around the year 1000.

Actually I think you'll find the first evidence of farming was in the middle east.

Human knowledge is a cumulative thing passed down from generation to generation. A generation or civilisation doesn't come up with things from no-where. Cultures learn from each, knowledge is passed down moved around. There is a chain of transition dating back to early man, but early man wasn't a Roman or a Greek, he wasn't anything. In that way it is ridiculous to say Europeans are the brightest/cleverest whatever Europe is no more than a political boundary, people are people regardless of where they are.

'inward looking'? This is stuff you're making up, not that 'inward looking' makes any sense said as a odd generalisation of things.

Western Soceity of the 50-60's was the least racist large scale culture in the world. And it is a good thing they were, what was wrong with it? It is what kept them together and kept them under the umbrella of traditions which made them so sucessful in the first place.

Did you even turn up to your history lessons? Printing was invented in China. Yes it was developed by Europeans, but nevertheless it did not originate there, as many things did not originate there.

Europe happened to find things at the right time, the european empires are a product of chance, more than anything - as I have already said without gunpowder from China they wouldn't have even had guns, one of the primary sources of their dominance.

Your eurocentricism blinds your judgement.

Europe was hardly any more a bastion of culture than China, Japan, India, Mexico (aztecs),Egypt. In fact in comparison it was pretty bland.

Nope, Western Society had spent 100s of years bombing and stabbing the **** out of each other. There was a strong sense of national identity, not western identity, the concept of Europe is so recent.

I'm sorry,but I don't catch your drift.You haven't established that being Christian and European is a necessary prerequisite for philosophical inquiry and scientific innovation.After all,the Ancient Greeks were Pagans.Their intellectual contribution to world history was far less as a Christian people, than their ancient ancestors.So I don't understand why you're bringing Christianity into this.
Take for instance, the ancient Chinese were certainly not European and never had any Christian influences,until the nineteenth century.Yet,they invented the gunpowder and printing press,.Two inventions that we cannot imagine without in the Modern world and were essential prerequisites for the recent global ascendancy of the west.
So I would argue that it's not essential to be either European or Christian to make great innovations and to achieve a high level of culture.

The benefits of progress where believed to be sufficiently obvious that the diffusion of useful innovations by means of trade and other forms of contact could be explained in terms of the exercise of human reason alone.
 

Hey 7-3 I know you didn't have an answer and went to bed, but I went back to reading for my course, actually on a similar theme to what we were talking about.

This quote from 'Archaeology and the idea of progress' (part of my first year reading list) paraphrases Childe a archaeologist of pre-history. So essentially we have the assertion here that the benefits of progress through diffusion of useful innovations are sufficiently obvious to human reason alone. Human reason not European reason, all humans aim to benefit through the diffusion of useful innovations. This guy makes no reference to superior races, just human reason.

Really?

With out using any reasource, name;

Three philosophers from each of these countries, China, Japan, India, Mexico (aztecs), Egypt.
Three muscians from each of these countires, China, Japan, India, Mexico (aztecs), Egypt.
Three artists from each of these countries, China, Japan, India, Mexico (aztecs), Egypt.
Three artistic styles from each of these countries, China, Japan, India, Mexico (aztecs), Egypt.
Three architectural styles from each of these countries, China, Japan, India, Mexico (aztecs), Egypt.

This could go on for days, but that'd just be statisfying your need to lie about things you don't know to make yourself feel better.

Well, we don't really know or hear much about any of these places. I'm sure if you asked a Chinese person about philosophers or artistic styles in China they'd quite happily give you an answer. Ask them to name three European philosophers or artistic styles and the parochial ones (i.e. the vast majority) might have some difficulty.

you can have me up the poop-chute

You asked about countries though, and unless you live in some bizarre bubble, I think it is safe to say that the great majority of English people could not name both three English philosophers and three English pre-1900 classical composers. In fact, I would go further, and say that the majority of English people could not name one pre-1900 classical composer or two English philosophers. And these are people who have lived in the country their entire lives! So, really 7_3, I think asking for three Mexican architectural styles is an extreme ask for any non-specialist.

Heck, I have some knowledge of philosophy and music, but would struggle if you asked me for three philosophers and composers from: England, France, Germany, The Netherlands, Spain, and Italy.

I'm a little confused, as I think most English/Irish/Welsh/Scottish people do not have indigenous roots? The indigenous culture and language died long, long ago, and very few people have any knowledge of their indigenous roots, if they even have such roots. Why should any government (be it Labour or BNP) take notice of a culture and peoples that no longer exist as an identifiably separate group?

White supremacists agree east asians are the smartest race. However, they also agree that east asians have a lower median intelligence than whites.

Yeah right, stupid statement, **** you there is academic sources I found without even looking that back what I was saying up.
 
 
The only recent attempt at collating and ranking what we might call "Human Accomplishment" that I would unconditionally recommend is the recent book by Charles Murray of the same name.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Accomplishment 

He attempts to set out objective criteria for saying which physicist, for example, is the most important, and it's a very interesting read. Certainly it's the most interesting bit of social science I've read.

He comes up against THE PROBLEM though, naturally: so many more of those detested Dead-White-Males than their yellow, brown, or black bros - and such an uneven spread among European peoples. He comes up with good explanations for this, too.

I have a digital copy properly bought and paid for which I'm quite happy to upload to a file sharing network or email to anyone interested in reading it. Just PM me.

For those who can stomach Jew-supremacists and filter their propaganda, Michael Hart wrote an interesting book along similar lines but delving a little deeper into the biodiversity angle, called "Understanding Human Accomplishment", see:

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_H._Hart 

This book is legitimately available online somewhere for free, but I can't find it right now. I can also pass a copy along of this one if asked.

i feel many people would vote for tehm becuase of the threat from islamic terroism but the BNP is a christian group so it would be like swapping one f****d up religious mind set with another, and if that happens, im moving to Norway

That is absolutely ridiculous, as I am from Europe I follow European education syllabi, and thus LEARN about Europe. If I was from China/Japan/India/Mexeco/Egypt I would learn different things. And Even then no one would be able to do the above as no one would study each of those countries in such detail, without being older...

Neverthless, fame =/= sophistication/advancement/anything really.

But when Labour do the same you sit on your arse and mouth off like a 'big man' over the internet?

Smart lad.

 
 
 
"But when Labour do the same"

What civil liberties have Labour taken away?

Labour have signed the Human Rights Act and the European Convention on Human Rights.
 
 
(Loxley, are you quite serious?)

Labour, New Labour, who expanded detention without trial, and provided support for US torture flights, whilst failing to bring significant pressure to bear on the issue of Guantanamo Bay, whilst making us the most spied-upon public in Europe, and spearheading compulsory ID Cards and failing to keep even presently-existing databases secure?

There are probably more, but I'm tired and can't be bothered. It seems like a good enough list as is.
 
 
"(Loxley, are you quite serious?)"

Yes.

"Labour, New Labour, who expanded detention without trial,"

The Tories did whilst they were in power as well. At least Labour have put in extra provisions such as judges having to keep checks etc...

"and provided support for US torture flights, "

Not Civil Liberties.

"whilst failing to bring significant pressure to bear on the issue of Guantanamo Bay,"

They did push for the release of all Brits held there.

"whilst making us the most spied-upon public in Europe,"

CCTV? Local councils are the ones who like using that. You also have to remeber that a densly populated country with a lot of people living in Urban areas will be subject to more CCTV surveilance than, say, a country like France which has a lot more rural communities.

"and spearheading compulsory ID Cards and failing to keep even presently-existing databases secure?"

The database security is not a civil liberties issue. ID Cards are already in many other nations and have not been (and probably won't be) implemented fully.

"There are probably more, but I'm tired and can't be bothered. It seems like a good enough list as is."

It's a small list if we were to compare it with what the Tories did before Labour;

* Police and Criminal Evidence Act
* Thatcher banning GCHQ members from Unions.
* The Interceptions of Communications Act - overrluing a decision made by the judiciary!
* The Public Order Act of 1986
* The Prevention of Terrorism act in '89
* Trade Union regulations

The majority of voters do vote for racist parties, correct, but not in the way you mean. And for pseudo-political parties too, if one considers that the great questions go determinedly unexamined.
 
i feel many people would vote for tehm becuase of the threat from islamic terroism but the BNP is a christian group so it would be like swapping one f****d up religious mind set with another, and if that happens, im moving to Norway
 

Unfortunately, you're right about the Muslim motivation. Not that being anti-Muslim is wrong, just that it isn't pro-anything. The BNP are cleverly riding on the coat tails of tptb when they focus on Islam, in this they are no better or worse than the bigger parties.

(And the BNP are not a "Christian group").

If you move to Norway you'll find the same low-level war going on between invaders and indigenous. And it is a war.

Charles Murray refutes this argument in "Human Accomplishment", but really shouldn't have to.

The idea that non-Europeans have made anything like an equivalent contribution to the world's scientific and other cultural heritage is absurd on its face.

Also, he makes the point that if we would look at Joseph Needham's exhausive study of Chinese inventiveness, for example, and decide that many more Chinese should make his list of the world's most important thinkers, we will need to look just as exhaustively at EVERY nation, including the Euros. It is no-fair to look at Europe with the naked eye if we look at everyone else's culture through a microscope.

It's hard to compare the liberties which Labour has taken away largely in the name of security and political correctness to the freedoms and values which the BNP would likely abolish in the name of Nationalism and hatred. You can still go around and speak your mind, and the worst you would get for inciting racial hatred would be almost a slap on the wrists.
Thanks to the current system, the BNP and other fringe nasties will never get more than a few MPs.
Under a BNP government, admittedly, there would be alot of limitations to their rule, and the international community will not accept another far-right European state. However, people ignorant of history(i.e. most BNP supporters) underestimate how quickly civil liberties and "democracy" can be eroded to a sorry state by extremists.

Point out where I said anything to the opposite. I agree, but that doesn't mean to say that others couldn't have done the same. European power and 'innovation' was the result of situationism, and previous ideas, not something unique to Europe.

On top of that, asserting that europe is the only place of any consequence (which is what started this) is absolutely absurd.

Ok, find this evidence that you are talking about. Again let me reiterate, I have never said and never will say the Europe is not and has not been important. But the fact of the matter remains that without other previous and MIGHTY cultures then Europe wouldn't have gotten to where it is today.

Previous cultures accomplished what Europe did with less technology, which in my opinion is more of an accomplishment.

Just because Europe conquered quite a lot of the world (and lots of it un-inhabited prior to them settling) doesn't mean that Europe is the best or "superior" in terms of civilisation or anything of the sort.

p.s. europe is not a nation -.-

More or less agreed. However, I would go so far as to say that we only think that because most of us haven't seen, and don't know what life in different parts of the world is really like. European cultures have been at the forefront for a long time, but they aren't the source of civilisation. Greco-Roman cultures were the founders of civilised Europe as we know it today, just as Ancient Egypt, Persia, and what we now know as China were to Africa and Asia. To say that Europeans were behind every major development in the history of civilisation is very ignorant, to say the least.

That's not a "fact", it's a theory, but I think it's right. But it also raises the question why these early civilisations did not also inspire other cultures which followed to reach the heights of the west.

I'm not quite sure what you mean, but are you sure earlier Europeans didn't do the same without these technologies. What "achievements" are you talking about?

Nor does it follow for Asians. The difference is that Europeans are full of shame for their (past) imperialism, while Asians look upon their periods of expansion as glorious.

You reply to SNP's straw-man by building another.

-- I think you're good on civil liberties until you get to its fundamental - letting an organic society survive - then you come over all PC (a tendency you decry) and oppose its most principled defenders: nationalists.
 
 
The time would be ripe for revolution.

Failing that, I would emigrate. France maybe? Canada? Russia? Cuba? Possibilities are endless.

What is your proof?

That is COMPLETELY unfounded based largely on the fact that 'Europe' is not a single entity, it is a mass of different civilisations or at least cultures. Whilst they do have similarities that did not stop them from differentiating themselves to the point where they were separate entities, England - Germany/Holy Roman Empire etc etc - Spain - Russia - France. Vary rarely worked together and as such cannot be considered a single civilisation in the way you are trying to portray them. This is in contrast to the likes of Egypt and the Aztecs, and even the Japanese (I'll leave China out of this as that is slightly more complicated) which were(/are in the case of Japan) single civilisatins.

It's got nothing to do with why they didn't. In the case of the Aztecs for example, they were wiped out...both through disease brought from Europe and the fact that the Spanish had gunpowder...If Europe hadn't had guns the west would not have been dominant AT ALL. Even with guns you will notice that African empires defeated European invasions many times, such is the case with the Ashanti Empire.

China...rising superpower - was a superpower, if not for a brief blip, such as when Britain entered the industrial revolution (again due to circumstances not the people - limited land mass etc), they would have remained a powerful entity.

Japan....The second biggest economy in the world. If it wasn't for the second world war (in which even the strongest European power was weakened ridiculously) they would probably have a sizeable empire or at least massive presence in the east.

I am saying that just because it became dominant doesn't mean that it is superior. I am in no way ashamed of the British Empire (look at my sig for goodness sakes   ), but that doesn't mean I an blinded such that I believe Britain or Europe is the ONLY place of any consequence EVER.

And about only Europeans being 'ashamed' of their imperial past, look at China a few decades ago....destroying everything to do with it, look up the cultural revolution....

Well seeing as I live in a European country, and I have only been taught European centred syllabi, they would have to be famous for me to have heard of them.

Due to the dominance of European ideals, Europeans live a sheltered life when it comes to things such as this. It's like the English language and native English speakers - only a small amount of the population are about learning another language, or indeed have the opportunity.

And by the way that's absolute rubbish, yes important thinkers have come from European thinkers, but so are other thinkers important, like Confucius.

China has always been more advanced the Europe until recently. While people in europe were begging churches for salvation from the black death, Chinese doctors were inventing remedies and using methods such as acupuncture (which are still used today.......)

No, the fact that other civilisations have accomplished great feats, akin to those of the west, is self evident.

I think it was you who mentioned the great cathedrals/churches that were built in europe? maybe not but anyway, look at the temples built all around the world, equally as impressive.

I like Confucius, not my fave eastern philosopher by any means, but very rational for a slit-eye, I like him. But how important is he really? Doesn't he just formalise the characteristic hierarchical tendency of east Asian societies, perhaps to the detriment of their innovative and independent thinkers - if such exist?

Oh, epidemics occurred in Asia my friend, and accupuncture didn't help any. Use of herbal medicine is universal - even Africans figured it out for themselves.

Well firstly, I don't really believe East Asia is particularly more hierarchy-obsessed than Europe has been. But remember that Confucius was a meritocrat: the qualities he sought after were not inhereted, but anyone could acheive them. China thus had exams for entry to positions of power whilst Europe was still a nepotistic dump.

Important enough for a seizable percentage of the population of planet earth to follow his teachings.

It's like saying how important was any figure that formed a quasi-religious movement.......

You missed my point. Yes there were epidemics, but unlike in europe where they didn't even attempt to find logical reasons for the occurrence, it being blasphemy to do so, in other cultures they weren't bound by this religious oppression.

You do know that until around the 1600s the church banned any kind of medical explanations other than those of people like Galen...holding back medical progression - this is the doctor that wrote his books about human physiology based on dissections of animals.... Such was the power of the church that despite doctors at the time finding contradictions to Galen's work they still upheld it blindly.

Exactly. Ensuring the right person filled the right position of power in the existing hierarchy is pretty much the sum C's philosophy.

East asians are found to be much more conscious of status and propriety than relatively individualistic Europeans in psychological studies. And the tendency toward very centralised, very stratified societies is far more marked in east Asia than in Europe, famously so.

I doubt it's genetic somehow, to be honest. It's probably more of a sociological/social anthropological thing. If you look at the societies on the margins of the Sinosphere they can have radically different societal structures.

My point was that the populations who embraced Confucianism were already relatively inclined to his proposed sort of social order. They already WERE confucianist societies. He merely formalised that kind of structure and its beneficiary elites naturally encouraged the development of religious props to defend it.

 
You missed my point. Yes there were epidemics, but unlike in europe where they didn't even attempt to find logical reasons for the occurrence, it being blasphemy to do so, in other cultures they weren't bound by this religious oppression.
 

This simply isn't correct. People didn't know what had caused the outbreak, but they took reasonable practical measures to combat it including limiting migration and imports and attacking Jews. As it turns out, and unknown at the time, TBD did originate in Asia and then migrated westward so these kinds of measures were not totally wrong headed.

I do. In one of my favourite books - Bob Whitaker's "Why Johnny Can't Think" - many parallels are drawn with the experts then and the experts today.

My only comment to that point is that in Europe, men had to be diverted from scientific experiment, whereas in the rest of the world they simply never got around to it. PC is having the same effect today.

Well, I think they gradate.

There is evidence for genetically based differences in attitude and temperament between racial groups, but it cannot be said to have ben proven conclusively yet. To be frank, it's only what you'd expect from evolutionary princliples anyway. It won't be surprising when they match "genes" to behaviours and find uneven distribution by race. It's already happening in a small way.

I don't care about the nuanced (i.e badly written) wording you use tbh.

Europe was hardly any more a bastion of culture than China, Japan, India, Mexico (aztecs),Egypt. In fact in comparison it was pretty bland.

I'm still waiting for names from these bastions of culture.

 
[I]Well seeing as I live in a European country, and I have only been taught European centred syllabi, they would have to be famous for me to have heard of them.
 

You should really say "Beacuse of my lack of historical knowledge, I don't really know what I am talking about", that'd be more accurate.

And is history really learning about all the 'famous' things? Or is it because we learn about the important historical things that they become famous? History is only 'famous' beacuse it is important and therefore taught, very rearly do historical things become fads nowadays.

 
Due to the dominance of European ideals, Europeans live a sheltered life when it comes to things such as this. It's like the English language and native English speakers - only a small amount of the population are about learning another language, or indeed have the opportunity.
 

Western Europe has always been one of the most open minded and receptive places on the planet, all this 'inward looking' and whatever is pure hyperbole on bad and fundementally incorrect liberal stereoptypes. Especially in the modern ear Europe has been the most cosmopolitan and culturally receptive, just look at Britain.

 
And by the way that's absolute rubbish, yes important thinkers have come from European thinkers, but so are other thinkers important, like Confucius.
 

I didn't say other places havent had important thinkers, artists ect. Confucius was important, middle eastern philosophy and political philosophy has been important. But none of them come close to riveling the west, in both achievement and historical importance.

 
China has always been more advanced the Europe until recently. While people in europe were begging churches for salvation from the black death, Chinese doctors were inventing remedies and using methods such as acupuncture (which are still used today.......)

Bad to look at the author maybe but it matters, don't you think?

Listen because this is getting very boring. You haven't really said anything this whole thread except try to deride something you don't even understand, your arguements rely on making the most base and sweeping generalisations and frankly (no doubt you've never actually thought about it) it relies on philosophical ideas that no intelligent person is going to agree with. Not to mention you're constantly chop changing and becomming very defencive.
 
 
I entered this thread only to say that objective measures may exist by which we can judge cultural contributions and to recommend the book by Charles Murray which does this well.

I should add, and unfortunately it needs saying in this age of Euro race-replacement, there are also two questions that we ought consider when being open or closed to other groups and their cultures:

1) Do the proposed changes, be they demographic or cultural have the overwhelming support of the population. It needs to be overwhelming and well-informed because once these changes are made, there's no turning back. This is especially true for ethnic transformations.

2) What are the implications for carrying capacity? Some cultures/technologies and some populations are decidely more likely to increase /decrease the carrying capacity of societies they would enter.

These together are of course arguments tending toward protecting the life and diversity of European groups particularly, so they are unpopular with corrupt Western elites and non-White or anti-White racists. However, when we philosophically support our leaders in ignoring these moral questions with regard to Euros, we leave the door open to their also ethnically cleansing Africa or Asia if they should chose to.

(I'd even say we make it inevitable)
 
 
 
I'm still waiting for names from these bastions of culture.
 

LOL!

Every nation has some sort of culture, even if it is largely influenced by another. Are you saying that Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Persian, and Turkish cultures were not influential in history?
You are truly ignorant, if you think that the whole world revolves around western civilisation. Asian nations were more technologically and culturally advanced than Europe in general for a long time up to the renaissance.

Also, I'm not even going to begin to correct all your spelling errors.

You're clearly unhinged. Even if the BNP were against everything non-White - and they ain't - that rather places them in opposition to Christianity which just loves the alien, literally!

You're clearly clueless too! When they spout ignorance it's because they are a political party, not a crypto-Christian organisation. The ONE thing they indupitably get right is the science and reason behind allowing peoples a free choice on how to live.

Everyone who defends the West and its nations has something "to do with" Christianity, the religious heritage of all societies is important and is disregarded at great peril. Even political parties hostile to the west and its nations can't avoid having something to do with Christianity!

no, i defend the west because it is a secular society not because its a christian one, religious heritage should be forgoten ASAP since all religion leads to is war and the feeling we are different from anyone else on this planet,

I specifically said peoples (plural): "The ONE thing they indupitably get right is the science and reason behind allowing peoples a free choice on how to live."

It might seem a nice idea - absolute freedom of the individual, but practically and morally, freedom must be limited to constraints agreed upon by society. Or there is no society...

i doubt the COE wants to get rid of religious influence on society like i do, the COE tries to adapt to the secular society because if it does not it will simply disapear, care to explain why i am wrong?

how can you be atheist yet want to keep christian dogma apart of society, or have i misunderstood you?

Yes, you're right, yours seems like a thoroughgoing hatred of all religion - the Anglicans only hate their own traditional beliefs.

You are wrong about religion leading only to war and the sunny uplands that await us all when we leave it behind. Religion serves the purpose for which it evolved better than anything else can - even certainties of political opinion - precisely BECAUSE it cannot be falsified by time or experiment.

What is the purpose of religion? To offer a common purpose to a society which transcends generations and is taboo to question. You ask whole nations to jump off the cliff and promise them that secular-rational angels will stop them hitting the rocks. When push comes to shove these nations will throw you off the cliff.

The handful of Christians with any real power in our society are all terribly non-dogmatic about it. If they held to traditional Christian views they wouldn't get anywhere near the circles of power. The culture war you think you're fighting was lost by Christians decades ago - most of 'em didn't even realise they were in a war.
 
 
"When push comes to shove these nations will throw you off the cliff"...

That's not to say that it'll necessarily be Christians leading the nationalist renaissance, though I think it may well be, but it'll be because people know that the one-world-one-people ideal doesn't have a chance of working.

You have a bad habit of putting words in my mouth. I never even suggested that they knew what had caused the outbreak. And you have proven that my point was right. Attacking Jews....haha, they attacked them because of religious prejudiced and ignorance, not any real medical reason.

And what does it matter where the disease originated? We aren't talking about that   stop trying to de-rail the discussion.

That is complete rubbish. It is a well documented fact that Islamic and Chinese medicine was light years beyond that of Europe until around the 19th century.

Even 'primitive' tribal society's were ahead of Europe, they knew about the medicinal properties of many plants - which incidentally were later discovered by Europe and used in modern day drugs. Does this mean that these societies were "superior" to europe? no of course not, it merely means they were in a position to take advantage of their situation. The same as Europe was during the colonial period.

I have already answered your ridiculous question. Go to those places and the people there will be able to tell you the names. The same as the people from Europe (well the educated ones at least) can tell you the names of their respective culture. Nevertheless, no one would be able to do what you are asking, it would require detailed knowledge of every culture, very different and far flung cultures.

And just because they are not well know (see: famous) does not mean that they are unimportant, there are many cases in which people are credited for discoveries they did not make.

Yes that is exactly the reason (and I even said that). You see, it is not that they are not there it is that they are not taught in European schools.

Lack of historical documentation does not remove the importance of a contribution.

Surely you know that when I sue the word famous I mean well known? Are you really that stupid that you cannot interpret words within context?

Year 9 in my school is the year in which you could stop learning history. What had we covered up to then?

Why were these taught? Because in Britain there are many sources available to relate to those topics. It requires little research for pre-16 year olds to get to grips with the topic.

You would also contest that because these are taught, NOTHING else from any culture is of any consequence? What a load of rubbish.

Oh please! haha, you really did make me smile with saying Western Europe was one of the most "open minded places and receptive places on the planet". It is NOW, yes. But how can you POSSIBLY say it has always been that way. This statement in itself has made you look like a complete and utter idiot, and has demonstrated that you lack fundamental (p.s. just to prove my point that you cannot spell basic words :fund a mentally) understanding of history. Western Europe and its culture (which includes America) has been the MOST discriminatory places and society's ever to exist. It has been a place of butchers and religious fanatics bent on obliterating any opposition.

Lets look shall we:
HITLER and the Germans The Crusades Cortez and the Spanish in central America Slave Trade Black civil rights in America French suppressing their colonies right to independence, Vietnam, Algeria, Congo Dissolution of the Monasteries by the Tudors Puritan persecution in England

Now, find a list of similar length without using any sort of source for China/Egypt/Aztecs/Japan/India. Don't worry I know you can't, but that isn't because such things did not occur, nor that they are any less important than those which did occur in the West.

I doubt Indian people care about the work of Aquinas, or even know about him - or that it even has an effect on them.

Please stop talking then. You do NOT understand anything about history, other than Europe had empires. You have demonstrated this by claiming that "Western Europe has always been one of the most open minded and receptive places on the planet", I don't even need to go into why you are oh so wrong.
How dare you accuse me of making sweeping generalisations, when you are the one who cannot say anything specific, provide any examples or even give a genuine reason (other than your opinion) on why Europe is "superior".
None of my statements have relied on philosophical ideas in the slightest, you are the one who brought up thinkers of the west. In fact you haven't said anything else.

Anyway, you really should try picking up a history book, they are quite interesting.

I wouldn't worry, the perverse sense of moral superiority this story will fuel is the immigrant communities' idea of itself as the put-upon victims of Racist Britain.

If Europeans had only had 200 years of free scientific enquiry into medicine by around 1800 (remember - you're the one who raised this extra-discussion), and the rest of the world had ALWAYS been plugging away at the same subject with maximim scientific rigour and innovative thinking, well, you can see your problem:

In just 200 years, Europe matched what the rest of the world had done in over a thousand years. I guess the exponential acceleration ahead of the rest that Euros have achieved since then is hardly surprising in that light. There's nothing to explain. Business as usual.

'Race replacement immigration'? Right... well, if your claim is that you're white Anglo-Saxon or Celtic, by your own logic you should go back to continental Europe  

Oh, and I didn't call anyone a pervert. I said the sense of moral superiority some white nationalists have is perverse.

Ridiculous, they TARGETED Jews not because they were foreign or because of any PRACTICAL reason, but because their religious prejudices made them believe Jews were evil.

Just because it may appear practical does not mean that they were doing it for that reason.

They didn't do it because they understood how the disease was being spread - they did it because they thought (wrongly) that the Jews were doing it. Religious bigotry.
On the same note you would contest that Hitler, exterminating the Jews, was taking reasonable practical measures because he believed they were really a cancer on European society?

Hardly, we are talking about the parallels to European and other cultures. Pointing out how one was more advanced that the other is hardly de-railing the discussion.

Talking about where the disease irrelevant, a matter out of the hands of both cultures, is however irrelevant and thus constitutes de-railing the discussion.

Furthermore, it is nothing to do with whether their methods did anything, it is practical thinking. Instead of running to the 'gods' to ask for help they thought about things logically - something which the Greeks also did.

Are you so hung up on europe that you can't even grasp that I wasn't talking about their inability to fight the plague but their inability to look past GOD and think for themselves?!

Because they built on the work of others. That is how the world works. And because they developed superior weapons (through the technology of others) they went on to conquer large parts of the world. THIS created immense wealth in the nations that did this. And they enjoyed prosperity. It is this prosperity that allowed such advancement, this is a well known fact. It even happened in the Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Chinese ages, When there is an abundance of wealth people have time to think about other things, such as medicine, philosophy etc.

You will notice that when cultures become poor their social development is retarded. Look at the Aztecs, a rich and wealthy society, they were reasonably advanced. But as soon as cortez had introduced diseases (bearing in mind they had been isolated for thousands of years with no contact outside of the Americas) and removed al their wealth they stopped advancing. Stopped in their tracks, look at mexico now...

Look at China, in modern times (starting to change now) their entire civilisation collapsed. And as a result everything halted.
Look at Britain, the industrial and agricultural revolution happened in Britain for a reason. Our landmass is so small that it was important to utilise the land to its fullest potential. We also saw the end of Feudalism, which mean the political climate was far more stable. And the amount of pandemics occurring declined.

You see it is situations like this which allow for advancement.

You clearly do not understand how development works. It is not an isolated thing. They BUILT UPON the thousand years of advancement that the world had made. They didn't discover everything on their own independently in 200 years.

You do not understand the importance of historical conditions which facilitate development, in fact your arguments are so incoherent that I doubt you have even studied history up to GCSE level.
 
 
That's the racist view to history. They think that European nations were the only ones seriously advancing. They are wrong, of course. The world doesn't develop unilaterally.
 
 
Well, I do not believe people in this country would be so stupid to vote in a Nazi party.

Therefore they would probably only get in power via a Coup d'état or an equivalent uprising.

But if that happens the best thing to do is organise the world's first Trotskyist revolution.

They are not in anyway taught in history lessons, at least the are not taught in many history lessons.

The rise of communism in China for instance. A MAJOR piece of history. Rarely (see: rarely not never) taught before key stage 4, and usually only at key stage 5.

In European education you would expect to learn about European history, from a European point of view. You are a testament to this, you are blinded either by this way of educating, or just plain ignorance.

Tell me, to what level have you studied history?

I never singled out the Aztecs in particular. I brought the Aztecs up because the person I was quoting at the time was saying that no where else had accomplished anything close to what Europe had don, in terms of architecture etc.

The Aztecs clearly had, they constructed a sophisticated city which included aqueducts and temple complexes, they also had a sophisticated calendar system.

It is blatantly obvious that the Aztecs haven't had the impact on modern society as others because of the fact they were isolated from Europe, Asia and Africa until the 16th century, and subsequently having their civilisation wiped out by people whom they welcomed (see: European people - yes those people who you claim to be from the most tolerant place on earth).

No more so than anything else. I fail to see how Japanese Imperialism and the breaking of the Anglo-Japanese treaty is any less relevant to the formation of the modern world than castles.

I also fail to see how the invention of the compass (China) is any less important to the formation of the modern world than the conflict in Northern Ireland.

This is not to say that the events studied at key stage 3 are NOT important merely that they are no less important than other issues that happen around the globe, outside of Europe.

I've done history in college up to A level, I got an A at the A2 exam having completed it in year 12. I have done much of my own reading on different subjects.

You are the one who do not understand events within context. You are simply taking events and looking at them individually, without any consideration for the things which have happened which have caused said event to take place.

You seem to have forgotten the point. You are trying to show how bad the rest of the world is in comparison to Europe. Yet the majority of your answers have only shown that the majority of conflict outside of Europe has been a direct result of the intolerance in Europe that you claimed was non-existent (particularly in the South African example).

You have only given three unique examples of acts of unprovoked intolerance outside of Europe.

Just off the top of my head I'd say for China: Confucius and Mao are the most famous philosophers. Ming dynasty( Ming vase) and the Ming architectural style. Also the Terracotta army of the First Emperor, some time BC, that period had a wealth of art. Thats the limit of my western education so far. Doesn't mean there isnt more.
I don't know of the other countries, but I'm sure a historian of India, Japan and Mexico would have quite a few.
Egypt has had quite distinct architectural styles, what they're called..?? Pyramid-era?

Bit late, but I'm not reading this whole thread.

Far flung in terms of geography smart ass, or do you need every bit of terminology explained to you?

Not true in the slightest. This statement just proves how ignorant you are.

They are not in anyway taught in history lessons, at least the are not taught in many history lessons.

The rise of communism in China for instance. A MAJOR piece of history. Rarely (see: rarely not never) taught before key stage 4, and usually only at key stage 5.

In European education you would expect to learn about European history, from a European point of view. You are a testament to this, you are blinded either by this way of educating, or just plain ignorance.

Tell me, to what level have you studied history?

I never singled out the Aztecs in particular. I brought the Aztecs up because the person I was quoting at the time was saying that no where else had accomplished anything close to what Europe had don, in terms of architecture etc.

The Aztecs clearly had, they constructed a sophisticated city which included aqueducts and temple complexes, they also had a sophisticated calendar system.

It is blatantly obvious that the Aztecs haven't had the impact on modern society as others because of the fact they were isolated from Europe, Asia and Africa until the 16th century, and subsequently having their civilisation wiped out by people whom they welcomed (see: European people - yes those people who you claim to be from the most tolerant place on earth).

No more so than anything else. I fail to see how Japanese Imperialism and the breaking of the Anglo-Japanese treaty is any less relevant to the formation of the modern world than castles.

I also fail to see how the invention of the compass (China) is any less important to the formation of the modern world than the conflict in Northern Ireland.

This is not to say that the events studied at key stage 3 are NOT important merely that they are no less important than other issues that happen around the globe, outside of Europe.

Just because you cannot critically analyse historical events does not make me stupid, rather it makes you unintelligent.

Exactly, yet I am not the one claiming Europe to be "Western Europe has always been one of the most open minded and receptive places on the planet". This statement is just WRONG.

I've done history in college up to A level, I got an A at the A2 exam having completed it in year 12. I have done much of my own reading on different subjects.

You are the one who do not understand events within context. You are simply taking events and looking at them individually, without any consideration for the things which have happened which have caused said event to take place.

What is your point? I am not denying that. When have I EVER said that nothing of any consequence has happened in Europe. When have I EVER said that Europe has not seen great leaps in certain areas.

wow, i have to say that is 1 of the most, if not the most, impressive posts i have ever read!  
 
 
I'd stick around. I think the British National Party has some extremely good and valid policies, but, of course, all you hear about are the bad ones. I think they would sort out a great deal in this country, much of it for the better. If anyone bothers to read their manifesto you will discover this for yourself.

However, they are also extremely pushy and often quite arrogant. Their racial policies are misguided, and they hold onto a warped ethnic dream of Britain being filled with strong anglo saxon men who, they believe, are currently oppressed by those of a different ethnic background. It's rather pathetic really.

But one thing I do commend them for, and that is for having some balls and being constant in their politics. If only the Conservatives, or Labour would do the same. Perhaps the BNP have the advantage of never realistically getting into power, so does this give them a mandate to go by their convictions rather than what will get the middle vote?

And since when was History lessons 'European lessons'? They aren't. In fact there is a whole month devoted to black history, and the education system is constantly being made more 'diverse' (i.e. ****). We learnt about African drumming in GCSE music, imagine my shock and horror at learning there really isn't anything to learn about african music. I suppose music education is horribly bisaed beacuse it only teaches European musical things such as written notation and scales.

 
Tell me, to what level have you studied history?
 

I have no formal history education, which is why your 'you are a testament to this, you are blinded either by this way of educating, or just plain ignorance.' is so funny. I know most about prechristian middle east, classical and then enlightenment periods.

You don't have an argument. You've just made a subjective claim that western thinkers are more important, universally, than any others. You need evidence to back that up.
 

Western thinkers are the most important, and the west is the most important civilisation that has ever exsisted. With no Europe there would literally be no modern world. The Renaissance gave the world universities, humanism and the copernican revolution, without which basically created modern science. The west was the birthplace of the industrial revolution and the British empire which would lead to the industrialisation of swathes of the globe.

What is your argument? That Aztecs were equal creators of culture as the west? So far you're unable to make any sort of arguement out of your sordid ideas.

Here's the thing, seen as you're still at school, go ask your history teacher "Which civilisation has been the most influencial to the creation of the modern world?"

You can trace European history back to the age of Charlemagne. Please don't talk about stuff you don't know about. Do you really think it's not obvious?

What do you mean by 'Europe' or the 'concept' of Europe..? Because historians freely refer to Medieval European history. The concept of England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, Frankish French, Spanish, Portugese, Aragonese, Italians, Sicilians, Germanic tribes (Holy Roman Empire), Vikings, Hungarians and various other principalities had been loosely established. England became a somewhat solid concept. France less so until the time of King Philip. Hungary under Coloman... et cetera

The continent of Europe kind of did vaguely always exist, so I don't see how your comment evades Ed's point other than serving as a dishonest distraction. Indeed, where do you find the roots of Europe? It's entirely arguable that Europe existed quite recognisably not so long after the Roman Empire.

You are one of the most idiotic people I have ever come across. Not to mention the fact you are an utter hypocrite.

On one hand you say it is important to know about the author, know about him to such an extent that you want to know his skin colour. You then go onto claim that the fact that it does not matter if history lessons - history being a topic in which bias plays a major role - are taught in a particular country (or continent in this case).

And are you utterly brain dead? Or perhaps it is that you cannot read?

You were the one maintain that if something was historically important it would HAVE to be well know. It was I who contested this.

I take it that you are now backtracking on this opinion. Good because it was an absurd one.

Point out where I branded them "European lessons". I merely pointed out that the majority (read: not all) of history lessons up until key stage 4 or later have their syllabi centred around European topics.

Please, provide me with evidence that shows this to be wrong.

Again you demonstrate your lack of understanding. Just because something has the word "history" in it does not mean that it taught as official lessons, or indeed assessed in any way.

In fact you will find that many schools do not even partake in it, and those that do do not look at in terms of formal education, but more of racial awareness.

Believe me this shows. You lack vital understanding on how to look at historical events.

Also, lets remember the key part of that sentence that you quoted:

"you are a testament to this, you are blinded either by this way of educating, or just plain ignorance "

Please site your references to this.

Europeans (as a whole) in 1352 to 1521 were far from living in metropolises. They were living in poverty, working the land.

The City of London (for example) at the time could hardly compare to Tenochtitlan.

I suggest you read what I said again. You have this nasty habit of not really reading what I say, instead seeing a few words and forming your flawed argument around that.

It's akin to me seeing your statement about having no formal education in history and then jumping to you have no formal education at all (not that I would be surprised - my 7 year old cousin can read, and spell, better than you).

The term "I fail to see" used in that context does not mean "I genuinely do not understand" it does in fact mean "<subject> does not". Common, how can you even begin to try and have an intelligent debate when you can't interpret basic and commonly used expressions?

Oh, going back to you being a hypocrite, in this particular case you accusing me of writing badly:

"Everyone else you has a sembelance of historical knowledge beyond what they read on blackhistory.com sees' it."

Hmm, very well written and coherent I must say. I assume by "sembelance" you mean "semblance".

Anyway, I genuinely don't know what you were trying to say there.

Here is where having an academic background in History (or any subject for that matter) comes in handy.

I make a statement which is supported by evidence - Europe has not "always" been a place of open-mindedness and tolerance. I listed the examples of how it had not been in my previous post.

Your reply to this is:

No it isn't (No it isn't a place of intolerance etc)

....

Do you see the problem? You do not back up this claim with any sort of evidence. You have no supported your original claim that:

"Western Europe has always been one of the most open minded and receptive places on the planet"

At all.

Furthermore, in your desperation to try and disprove my point you make more false statements, such as "You think the rest of the world was some diversity tolerance utopia". I never said that. Nor did I even hint at it. In fact, In a previous post I said - just because you could not name similar atrocities similar to those which occurred in Europe did not mean that they did not happen. But, the 'examples' of brutality that you listed in your previous post (the ones we are talking to them, read: not all) were actually a direct result of European intolerance, which makes your above statement even weaker.

Oh, and seeing as you were talking about ad hominem I wouldn't start talking about my ancestors  . Again you highlight your hypocrisy.

You are hopelessly confused. You were the one saying a few posts back that if it was important then it would be famous or well known - NOT - me. No matter how many times you say the opposite in this post it won't change that  .

And this argument is completely ridiculous. You are SERIOUSLY contesting that Human development to the modern day is not a culmination of many things. You are SERIOUSLY saying that everything today is the work of Europe and Europe alone.

This really does show that you have no understanding of History.

I have not backed down at all. My point is, and always has been, that Today's society is a culmination of different societies. Nothing of the 'modern society' is the result of completely independent development. My second point to this was that Europe is not the only place that has ever been of consequence.

And by the way, I have noticed you grouping several different (and generally unrelated) quotes together because you cannot address them.

Oh please, you have been spouting rubbish about "Europe" talking about it as a single entity through the entire thread. Never once have you acknowledged a single country, nor the deep divisions between them.

Oh and by the way, I clearly stated (in one of my posts at LEAST) that China is a bit different as it has not been a single entity. However, you are in no position to mention this, as Europe is no more a single entity than "china".

Semblance

Your spelling errors are seriously starting to annoy me.

And it has EVERYTHING to do with intolerance. How can you deny that Apartheid has nothing to do with intolerance. Just how ignorant are you? How can you contest that that Imperialism has nothing to do with intolerance? At the very least it was intolerant to the regions former rulers, not to mention the people the respective empires enforced their rules on - often unwillingly.

You really need to be educated, or at least get some common sense.

Arguably true, of course you would have to first define what you mean by western civilisation, do you mean from the Romans. But I have never said that it wasn't. I have said (and have always been arguing against) that the west is the only place of any consequence.

Completely incorrect. You are in no position to say that. It is perfectly possible that things such as the renaissance and industrial revolution would have happened elsewhere. Perhaps not at the same time, but that is not to say that they wouldn't have taken place in one form or another.

But obviously the world would not exist in its present state.

And? Yes they did occur in western civilisations at those times. But it is not to say they wouldn't have happened in other places.

Perhaps if Europe hadn't had such aggressive and hostile Imperialistic ideals other cultures could have continued to develop until they reached some sort of breakthrough moment/period.

It is impossible to say of course, but you cannot say that they would not have happened.

Argument.

If you do not know what my argument is then please stop replying to me. I have made my argument very clear throughout this thread.

I have said that the Aztec civilisation was a sophisticated one. They were not living in mud huts as some other posters (to whom I was originally replying) were making out. They had buildings which rivalled (or even surpassed) the architecture of Europe at the time.

By the way sordid was the wrong word to use in that sentence, or if you did intend to use it, a touch melodramatic.

Influential

You are confused. We are not, nor have we ever, been debating which civilisation has been the MOST influential on the modern world. We have been debating whether or not others have been influential (at all) or if they were sophisticated or primitive.

And by the way I am not at "school". And even if I did ask one of the tutors, they most certainly wouldn't reply with "Europe" or the "West" As an educated person would know that it is not a single homogeneous civilisation.

You really do fail at debating. You can't make a statement and go "find that [supporting evidence] yourself". If you make a statement you need to back it up, especially one such as that.

And you are now telling me that my replies are in too much detail or use too much vocabulary? Sorry, what? If you can't understand full sentences then go back to school, and whilst you're there learn to spell.

In his last one he accused my post of being too wordy, on top of saying that apartheid was not an example of intolerance.......

Ha ha ha the grammar nazis are out. Fine let's do this again, I have fun treading over your worthless chatter anyway.
 
 
Leave. Near Immediatly. Emigrate to a free country, France probably, maybe Germany. But then on second thought, get 'Anonymous' or get an anonymous protest 'army' and create a V revolution.
 
 
i would definetly leave the country.
 
 
In my mind, revolution. In reality probably leave the country.
 
 
BNP, believe it or not are a left wing party, apart from their views on immigration.

They believe in nationalisation and resdistribution of wealth.

They have strong environmental policies, which is why of late many members of the Greens have defected to them.

Basicly, its a happy socialist society, as long as you're white.
 
 
The main question I think that needs asking is: why do BNP members feel endangered by other races and cultures? I would bet a substantial amount that your average working-class white lad (BNP's main demographic, correct me if I'm wrong) goes out of a Friday and gets his takeaway from the local Indian or Chinese and watches his mixed-race football team.

Why are you scared of people from other races?

Oh jesus.
 
 
OP, what do you want to discuss or debate? You can discuss the broadcast if you wish, but you can't just advertise it.
 
 
Their broadcast looks like it was made on Windows Movie Maker  

The sad thing is though, I can see it doing quite a good job at attracting ignorant/protest voters.
 
 
Thanks for the info. I know now when to turn off the tv.

We got through their flyer today and honestly I agree with the quote on the front:

 
Because its not racist to oppose mass immigration and political correctness - it's just common sense!
 

Clearly, I have issues with most of their policies, but a few are quite reasonable.
 
 
Now the BNP are setting up youth groups. Anyone else reminded of the Nazi party and the Hitler Youth...
 
 
so.. many.. parody.. opportunities...
 
 
"Is it racist to look after our own people?"

Yes. Duh.

Why? Please explain this...

Racism is by definition: The prejudice that members of one race are intrinsically superior to members of other races.

How is looking after the inhabitants of a country racist?

Yeah it reminded me of this REALLY cringeworthy anti-BNP story from the NOTW
 http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/news...-sessions.html 

 
THE BNP is setting up a BRIT-LER YOUTH to indoctrinate children, we can reveal.
 

BRIT-LER YOUTH          
 
 
Well anyone who doesn't see them as prejudiced and discriminatory (at best) is pretty blind.

But this is what I see as some pretty excellent strategy- the BNP doesn't out and out say "get blacks out" or similar, but it makes you think back to when Britain was a less diverse nation. They talk about PC going too far (which it has) but the problem is that they are coming from a "We want to be able to say the N word to Obama" point of view.

Freedom of speech is something we should be proud of, but if you're just going to exercise it selfishly and aggressivly perhaps you should just sit in the corner with a D on your hat.

I suppose by looking after one national group as oppose to another you are treating them as superiors

Hmm. Very interesting point, I think your right. Looking back into history this is what always happens, the Nazis being a good example: they only reveal their true policies and ideals when they are actually in power.

We don't need to wory about the BNP however, as they will never gain any influenceable power.

You've fumbled a definition together there. Was having separate water drinking fountains for blacks and whites racist? Of course it was. It didn't have any intrinsic superiority to it, it was simple segregation. That is racist.

So yes, looking after 'your own people' means discriminating against those who are not 'your own people'. Hence, racist.
 
 
Darren Brown, I'm not joining that group but lol @ him spelling "read" wrong.

Yeah its interesting and its the only reason Griffin isn't in jail- he was almost caught out a while back but couldn't be prsecuted because he didn't actually tell anybody to use violence to get people out of the country.

Yes, and I did not refer to families in that. Whilst that would be discriminatory, another term would be used for it. Racism however only applies to races, peoples, national groups and so forth.
 
 
"No-one elses names"

Yes, because the commonwealth forces had no part to play in WW2.

Anyone else notice the evil music when Nick Griffin came on screen?

My definition was the Princeton Universities definition, not one I crafted myself specifically to back up my point.

If I came round your house, ate all your food and drank all your wine, would you still want me there? If I came round would you pay to keep me there?

There's no discrimination based on race here. I am NOT racist; I have an ethnically diverse group of friends. Muslims, Christians, Hindus even Buddhists.

I have no problems integrating with those of a different race, I DO have a problem with those people who come to the country I live in and am proud of, and then taking tax payers money to live here. And it's not just minorities I have problems doing this with, those on benefits when they could be working are on the same level in my eyes. However if we could limit the number of people coming into the country, raping it of what money it does have, we would be part the way to solving the problem.

Of course I don't blame people for doing it, they are well within their rights to due to laws set up by the morons running this country. The same morons who are doing EXACTLY the same thing, stealing our taxpayers money.

If I have the option to vote for a party who will stop this then I will. I am not racist but I do want to look after the integrity of the great country I live in.

Why do you say it was a good video? I ask because, as I found the argument in the video rather sketchy and unclear, I'm interested to hear what others saw in it that made it "good".

Not to mention the Free French, the Poles, Czechs and Belgians who flew with the RAF, the underground movements across Europe who helped undermine the Nazi regime, etc.
 
 
'Sorry this video is unavaliable' - does anyone have another link?

Well considering the BNP leader has a conviction of inciting racial hatred and the fact that mixed race marriages are banned and according to them anyone who isnt white isnt british.... and the fact you support these idiots..... It seems you are racist after all!

These loonies want to leave the EU killing any trade and capital movement links which will mean the UK will lose it competitiveness.... How great will we be if we have whole industries suffer greatly from the lost European demand?
 
 
In the video they emphasise British born, and immigrants that came into the UK in the 60's etc who they have no problem with. This isn't true, but people will think its reasonable.. after all the video made them seem civilised! I'm just thinking, what are their plans for sorting out the immigration stuff, and what will become of the many "non-british" people living in this country. It's a reign of terror, who would want that for this country :/

No, it doesn't solve the 'problem' as you see it at all, it merely provides a distraction.

I think they cause trouble for the communities by going in calling for the immigrants to get lost... and letting the peaceful tolerant people deal with the backlash and vice versa.

Im sure people with different skin colours and cultures can live in harmony side by side without pricks like the BNP and the NF spoiling it.
 
 
It made sense. And was quite persuasive, but still don't agree with ALOT of their policies.

Even russel brand knows the BNP is racist!
 
 
Not saying they ever will that is.

But I just wanted, they always say they aren't racist...but everything they do attracts white Brits and I don't think there are any black or asian british born followers.

What happens if that stupid slogan, 'Put British people first' include the ethnic minority people who were born in Britian? Will they be snubbed and will an apartheid occur?
 
 
Wait... there was a day when there were honest politicians?!  

I can see what the person who mentioned windows movie maker meant too...

What was that bit about "good people, regardless of colour, should come before spongers and new arrivals who've never lifted a finger to help build this country"... Are they trying to suggest that all British people are good people, and immigrants are all spongers? Otherwise, except for the bit about new arrivals, that seems to be contradicting the text on screen as those words were spoken - "British jobs for British workers".

To be fair, just because the BNP has a few idiots within its ranks doesn't mean the whole ethos if the party is neo-nazi. The member of the Young BNP that Russel Brand interviewed isn't even in the BNP anymore. When Tony Blair first became Prime Minister, there was a story about him running around in his hotel room taking the piss out of Japanese people. Does that make the whole of the Labour party racists?

Also, the first BNP councellor was a half-black women.

I REALLY wish these racist idiots wouldn't hi-jack the memory of the people who died in two world wars to protect our country from people just like them. And "we aren't racist"? Me thinks he doth protest too much...

The day the BNP is elected is the day I, a proud british born citizen, emigrate to another country. Ironic that isn't it?

Jesus christ do they not have one literate person in the BNP, mainstream is one word not two. Seriously they must have been able to find someone to check it over or even type it into google to check.

I suspect quite a few Conservatives are pretty handy with their firearms already. As for summer camps; no, but we do have conferences. A few tents would probably make them rather more entertaining.

Nope, although some CF members do enjoy  putting George Osborne speeches to trance music .

He was the leader of the youth BNP until the undercover documentary and the court case against him and Nick Griffin - he was then fired from that position, I think he then went on to do some editing for the BNP, not sure what he's doing now though.

There's possibly nothing wrong with teaching people to shoot. It's the fact that it's a political party with less than positive views towards certain people that worries me.

Im sure I saw Mark Collett on the Channel 4 news on Thursday. The story was concerning Nick Griffin being able to swing an invite to the Queen's Summer Party. Im sure Mark Collett was walking alongside Nick Griffin. Im not sure how long ago the footage shown was from though.

This stood out to me as I saw the Russell Brand documentary on the BNP youth when he did the Re-Branded shows just the other day. Despite being completely high on drugs, Brand did a top-notch job of showing Collett up as a racist.
 
 
Oh dear,did they just blame Islam for heroin addictions? Quite an incredably stupid broadcast. As a question, how come its only children of immigrants who came in the 50's and 60's which are allowed to stay?

Presumably to extend their potential electorate to include the sizeable numbers of 2nd generation immigrants.

I thought it was a bit off to justify their policies because of the number of English people who died in WW2 - plenty of people from all nationalities died for the Allies.
 
 
I was watching "Have I Got News For You?" tonight, when they mentioned a "Youth BNP".

I have now investigated this on the net, what are people's opinions, it looks like a pro-active scouting group but with trends that worringly reflect the Nazi Youth Groups in the 1930s. I cant believe I never knew about this, how is this party even allowed to exist!!!!!!!!

Discuss, the BNP need to be put straight?

 
 
 
What the BNP needs far less publicity than it gets. Reducing the number of TSR threads about them would be a good start.

Anyway, another ******* BNP thread. Great. Thanks. You've really earned your oxygen today.

****.
 
 
A worrying video indeed, you have to understand that it is produced, mediated, to you to look basic. Simple is what relaxes the audience because they then think they know more than the producers of the text they are viewing.

This therefore creates a link between the text (video) and the audience (you), that allows them to get their message across a hell of a lot easier.

Thats where the other parties fail, their flash videos just don't have the same effect. The worst thing is, find some Nazi propoganda videos on the "yootube" and there are some terrible similarities.

The BNP need to be controlled in some way or another, with the way the country is going, the proletariat feels the effect of economic recession etc, similar conditions grafted a pro-Nazi populist movement in the early 1930s (purely because they looked to offer a way out by providing employment etc)!

I'm not saying these punks are Nazis at any length, but we have to be careful - surely!

Anyone with half a brain cell would clearly understand how discriminative and racist their policies are. We're living in the 21st century for goodness sake. Times have changed. People are marrying outwith their race and Britain's favourite food is curry! So why don't we just drop the BNP thread, please?

However, to answer your question. If it ever happens (in their wildest dreams), anyone who is not 'white' i.e of british origin white, they'll have to leave. How on earth they'll do that, i don't know. But that is ultimately what they want and see is best for Britain.
 
 
I can't understand why anybody would ever vote for a party which purposefully mimics the nazis, they could have invested in to countless other ways of attracting members, instead they create a morally dubious 'BNP youth' which not only stinks of nazism but raises questions about indoctrinating children in to something they are not yet old enough to judge without a bias
 
 
just watched a bit of 'youth BNP tv', nice bit of open racism, idiocy and bias for children.

Are you supporting freedom of speech or the BNP?

Because the former I can understand but the latter not so much.

The BNP youth is just the same as any other youth political faction, i.e. it instils its policies and belief in the people that join. Just sadly it's totally misguiding young people into racism and thuggery.
 
 
And Young Labour is the Komsomol...

The right to free speech argument I don't consider valid. If one group has the apparent 'right' to demean particular minority groups, they then are directly taking rights away from said groups, and it is that very idea of freedom of rights they then use to justify their claims. Entirely hypocritical.

"**** you" isn't entirely helpful to a Briton who is, under these ideologies, unjustly devalued as a member of British society. In fact, "**** you" is pretty much the tone of the policies the BNP speak of.

Hatred towards others because of their political views indeed. How, erm, fascist....
 
 
And thus lies the blatancy of racism in their claims. It's barely even political - it's merely hatred put on a pedestal.

Even if you ignore the absurdity of the claims that 'Black and Asian Britons do not exist', how an Earth would Britain as a society function without British (thank-you-very-much) minorities and people of exceptional ability and talent who do not come from the UK?

If anyone could legitimately answer this question, I'd appreciate it very much. I'm now intruiged!

In fairness I think there would be few TSR users moved by this thread to join the BNP; I saw it on HIGNFY as well, and if you'd seen it, you'd probably want to discuss it too - it is pretty horrifying, as the OP mimicking the methods of the 20th century European fascist parties; while all political parties in Britain encourage youth involvement (teenagers rather than young children) none have their own 'movement', especially one as militaristic as this; with its lies, indoctrination, and what virtually is tetering on the edge of violent tactics, I don't really consider the BNP a party at all; it simply doesn't operate within the boundaries of the British democratic system, instead fst becoming a fascist military group.

We can't prohibit freedom of speech of course - I never would suggest we could - but nonetheless we can impose limits when it comes to the creation of some kind of private rascist youth army - I mean, they're even having shooting competitions for Christ's sake.

And that comic strip is horrifying. How can these Holocaust denying, hate-spreading thugs be considered even in the same political arena as the other parties?

Pardon? I'm not quite sure I follow. I'm referring explicitly to British law which we must all abide. For example:

I, as a black person, have the right to not receive hate speech because of my race. I am not aware of any law that protects people who wish to express any perceivable opinion. Indeed, that contradicts the former and doesn't make a singular ounce of moral sense.

Should we now allow people the 'freedom' to speak of children sexuality. To speak of violent intentions. To speak of anything else that is rightfully taboo - to avoid 'facism'.

No. Ridiculous.
You can draw a long, confusing squiggle to try and justify unjustifiable claims, or you can stare at a straight line, use something called 'logic' our brains have so helpfully acclaimed, and perceive right from wrong.

lol i'd love to attend one of their gatherings. you can imagine being given a whole textbook called "identifying immigrants and what to do when you see one"- brilliant.

on a more serious note; it's definitely quite concerning that youngsters are being taught values such as intolerance of others, etc. god help us if their membership numbers start to increase...

Just googled Young BNP and their missions statement makes me sick:
 
-The BNYM will fight for the rights of our young people and ensure that anti white racism is resisted at every level.

-The BNYM will educate our young people and help them understand their history and culture free from the cancer of political correctness.

I'm not suggesting anything. Indeed, I don't see any feasibility in Britain functioning as an entirely white state. Hence my enquiry as to BNP's actual policy on the matter and how they plan to sustain the country without the workforce of minorities - who therefore of course aren't British and don't deserve to take jobs from British people.

You're idea is interesting. Though, it could really be interpreted as modern slavery. Though, looking at their company, I wouldn't let the idea of slavery pass them by, maybe that is their solution (*chuckles to owns self*)
 
 
 
we call for an immediate halt to all further immigration, the immediate deportation of criminal and illegal immigrants, and the introduction of a system of voluntary resettlement whereby those immigrants who are legally here will be afforded the opportunity to return to their lands of ethnic origin assisted by a generous financial incentives both for individuals and for the countries in question.
 

 http://bnp.org.uk/policies/immigration/ 

So i think they're going to try to force ethnic minorities out by paying them.
 
 
Has anyone read the wall shouts on their website...

nicholson: our we have to prase forangers every day and we got told it was normal for them to speek their laguage in our communatiy

Alastair Hone: i was suspended from my school for calling a boy a pakki,even though that is what they call themselves

JJWS: Dont waste your time reading the koran - just read up at faithfreedom.org what a sham islam is.

lewis: discrimination against white children in schools is okay but when its foreign children its racist thanks britain.

etc. etc.
 
 
**** Bnp!
 
 
Yay for the Griffen Jugend.
 
 
Young Nazi and Proud:

 http://video.google.com/videoplay?do...nazi+and+proud 

About Mark Collet, the then leader of the young BNP. Well worth watching imho, you get to see what he really thinks about ethnic minorities, Jews, homosexuals etc, when he thinks the camera's off.

The BNP youth is just the same as any other youth political faction, i.e. it instils its policies and belief in the people that join. Just sadly it's totally misguiding young people into racism and thuggery.

When will you people learn that free-speech doesn't mean only those with views you agree with can talk. You can't decide who gets free-speech and who doesn't!
 
 
Its very sad. BNP stand for hate and its terrible. The innocence of youth is now being targetted.

What makes it worse is that as people become disillusioned with the mainstream political parties they tend to shift towards the BNP. They have been voted in some places......have those places actually improved?

Apprently he got kicked out of the party after the broadcast. Some might just say that the reason for his departure was the other higher up members trying to save their own skin, but it does show some concious thought within the party that, that behaviour is not acceptable. Some might argue, well if the BNP found his behaviour so unacceptable why did they give him position as Youth Leader in the first place? You've gotta realise that a lot of the offensive things he said was when he thought he was off camera, off the radar, so, equally, he may not have been saying that at offical BNP meetings either.

In my opinion, because of the nature of the party (predominatly nationalist), you are bound to get unsavary characters joining, but I also think there are a lot of people in the BNP who genuinely aren't racist, overly nationalistic prehaps, but not racist. It may just be the propaganda having an effect (but which party doesn't try that), but I think Nick Griffin himself means well, and isn't really that malicious, but there are a few thugs in the party which make it look very bad.
 
 
I just hope for all of us that they don't gain from hthe recent issue-

I just want to know why I should have to have a loan to go to university when 20 years ago you didn't! Do the government actually want to encourage us into debt!

((Sorry just had to say it- I support the free university campaign)
 
 
The people within the party may incite racial hatred directly, but what the party is defined as through their manifesto does not.

Also, it's a bit hilarious that they call it "BNPTV" when actually they've just nicked it off Vimeo.
 
 
And what the hell, only British named people have fought for Britain? What about World War One when thousands of Indians fought for the Queen in the trenches?

My God these people are stupid.
 
 
Just a quick question, what happens to all asian brisitsh people, even if they were born in this country? To they get forced out??? just a question, sorry if i have offended anyone?
 
 
Lol, I have some idiot commenting on the "nothing british about the BNP" video on my FB and saying that the BNP doesn't want to deport people. One quote from the BNP constitution and he's now changing his tune to "its not racist, and anyway we're not kickign them out we're encouraging them to leave".

Moron.
 
 
As an immigrant, I agree with some of their sentiment, the same as I think that people should be more patriotic towards their own country, but I do think they're taking it too far with taking Britain out of the EU etc.
 
 
i have to admit, i found that broadcast surprisingly good.
Dont get me wrong, im no BNP supporter, but they do seem a little more down to earth than i originally thought.

I mean im totally opposed to their policies on bringing back death penalty etc, aswell as closing all foreign (US) bases on UK soil, BUT they do have quite a few, as he said, common sense policies.

Reinstateing the importance of St. George's day, every other country in the world has some sense of self pride, so why cant we ?

Severely cutting down on the nanny state, giving benefits to those who need them, not those who just decide its easier than getting of their fat arses and getting a job. Think of the millions we could save there.

Bringing back the ******** to schools. Have schools actually teaching pupils, not just acting as crowd control centres. With schools in the country that fail to achieve even 10% of their pupils with more than 5 grades above C, then you know there really is a problem.

So yeah, im not saying go out and vote BNP, but i do think people need to give them perhaps a little more respect than they receive currently. All this simple fascism against a so called fascist party really doesnt make sense..

A party is deemed fascist because it puts its own people before immigrants, but the general public are oh so heavenly despite openly discriminating against a party with a significant following..

put it this way, Nick whatshisname wasnt allowed into Buckingham palace because he was deemed to radical etc. If a radical islamic leader from a legal party who openly opposed the west was invited to the garden party, and was as contravercial as the BNP, then do you think anyone who have the balls to deny him entry ?
Of course they wouldnt, because thats just racism isnt it...

[edit: wow, that was longer than expected.., just to remind people, im no BNP supporter, that was just some random outburst   ]

To be honest it is what they see as problems that I agree with partially. Not their answers. I keep saying this: If people want rid of the BNP they're going to have to stop laughing off immigration as some kind of racist xeniphobia, because careing about not having access to public services isn't racist.

Why do you think/believe that this country NEEDS minorities to function economically? firstly we never used to in the past and secondly do you think this points to some sort of larger problem with our country if we can only 'survive' by importing people to work 'for us'. It seems inherently unsustainable to me as well as morally dubious.

I don't mean to sound patronising but please have a think about why we import low skill labour into this country when we have plenty of low skilled, unemployed people sitting around on benefits? Who does immigration really benefit? is it the country as a whole or is it more about using free markets to drive down wages and maximise profits.... i think i know the answer to this one.

Tbh i don't know of any specific examples, mostly because they have very few elected people, with very little power or resources and most of them represent places i have never been to.

Their most high profile person, Richard Barnbrook on the london GLA has made quite an impact imo, so hes been good.
 
 
No but most of the BNP's less informed members (and lets be honest a lot of their leadeship) ARE racist and their policies don't come from a pragmatic standpoint, they come from an ideological one.

oh i know, dont get me wrong, much of the BNP's support is from people who simply vote for them as they are the so called racist party, and probably have no idea of their other policies etc. Thats one of the main problems i find with them, not so much them as a party, but the aura that surrounds them. I could never bring myself to vote for them, id never get any sleep at night =]
 
 
Hmm... this broadcast could very well bump up their support by a couple of percent.
 
 
I'm actually quite surprised at how well made that video is!

Rubbish.

It makes much more 'moral sense' to protect the right to free expression than your right not to be offended. Not least because you should have no right to not be offended. Assuming you wouldn't go running to the police if you were offended or received hate speech because you were, say, ugly, stupid, an MP, a notorious paedophile or generally a ****, how is it a morally consistent argument to say hate speech based on someone's race should be illegal?

Disregarding the current legality, if someone wanted to walk up to you in the street and say, "Oi nig-nog, we think you should you **** off back to blackland and shag a monkey" then they should have the right to do so. Much as we'd all like to see such a person rot in prison, like it or not they are expressing an opinion. Opinions, like hate and offensive language, are entirely subjective and no one should have the right to decide which opinions are acceptable, especially not the government.

Don't get me wrong, I hate the BNP and pretty much everything they stand for, but I don't really see why that should matter.

Discuss, the BNP need to be put straight?

 

 

To be fair, there is a Conservative Youth, a Labour Youth and a Lib Dem Youth, i doubt they go scouting and shooting though

The only defence the BNP have is "freedom of speech". Which also means the right to attack and criticise them in full.

I think you'd be surprised how important image is in political marketing.

A huge proportion of the population are sympathetic to some BNP policy (death penalty, EU withdrawal, anti-immigrant / immigration), but until now their image as a skinhead party and their generally unprofessional appearance has held them back from achieving considerable support. People didn't trust them.

You have to admit that it's pretty worrying what could happen if BNP really do present themselves as a valid, decent alternative. I'm very cynical of the masses and think a significant proportion of them have national socialistic tendencies.

Ads like this are good for the party and bad for our country.
 
 
I read the website as well after have i got news for you- its like lets go camping and tell patriotic stories and when weve been prejudiced against! It shocked me that people believe this enough to sign up- fair enough if you agree with some of their policies- thats your choice but to model it on the Hitler youth and to brag about friendships with german neo nazi groups is so extreme i honestly cant believe people can be taken in by it to change their original opinions!
 
 
The BNP are a legitimate party like any other, and are perfectly ok to have a youth side.
 
 
Nick Griffin is not electorally photogenic at all. He looks like a nasty angry man. The advert didn't actually talk about any policies or anything just had some images of Churchill and war heroes etc etc. Churchill's about the most iconic Conservative PM so they may as well have put Maggie Thatcher up.
 
 
That is scary really - young people being brought up to think of themselves as better and more deserving of a better life just because of their skin colour.

I know of their policy of ''voluntary'' expulsion of foreigners, but is that just non-whites? My mum was born in canada but has lived here since she was 18, and is white. Would they try to kick her out?
 
 
Its because when a lot of people (not necessarily the average TSR member) look at Churchill they think "British".

I say it again, the BNP electoral machine is very well put together.
 
 
I know there have been loads of threads about the BNP and everyone (including me) is getting fed up of them.

however....

I was thinking (   ) about the BNP and UKIP, and that if I was so heavily inclined against Europe that I decided that it would be the most important issue, that I would vote for one of these parties, that it would be more advantageous to vote for the BNP because they are more likely to take the EU parliament seriously than UKIP, and therefore more likely to use the power they are given, act with their beliefs rather than just being purposefully frictional against the EU like UKIP.

amirite?

ED: just to clarify, (their is always going to be one ideot going "OMFGFGGGFGG!!111oneoneone you racist" I'm not a BNP supporter (or ukip for that matter), I just thought it was a rather different take on the euro elections.
 
 
Not really. UKIP opposes everything the EU does. If the EU had the same believes that the BNP did, the BNP wouldn't oppose them. At least that's my view. UKIP is an organisation based around sovereignty and decentralisation. The BNP is pretty much Peronist.
 
 
Green Party ftw

which is my point, they go to the EU just to get in the way, they don't have enough power to change anything, just cause obstruction, it seems pointless.

I think the BNP appear to be far more mature in their attitude than UKIP (as much as it pains me to say it).
 
stuff like this doesnt help

You are contradicting our society as it currently and lawfully stands?

The Public Order Act 1986 does protect people from racial discrimination. If you'd like to explain why this Act is unjust or why it should not exist, as you've implied?

Thus, excessive 'freedom of speech' contradicts this law if this alleged 'freedom' is stretched to the right to discriminate people and take away their rights as equal and valid members of British society. The BNP says that white Britons are the only valid members of Britain and therefore freedom or speech doesn't contradict it - but otherwise, it IS a contradiction. Freedom of speech is ideology and, like any ideological belief, it can't truly exist in an extreme sense, it does require analysis and creating an applicable and appropriate compromise.

I find people who oppose to the notion of any limit on freedom of speech speak entirely on egocentric grounds and don't look to logically analyse practical application of 'freedom of speech' into an equal society.
 
 
Oh and I'm guessing that they're forgetting the white community who also sponge off other peoples hard work ? i.e CHAVS.

The advert only looks good because they make their policies seem like this:

-Everyone is Patriotic
-Everybody gets fare wages and lives a nice life
-Nobody is wrongly mistreated

When their policies are actually this:

-Stop immigrants from entering the country
-Take out the immigrants that are already in here
-Give the jobs to the unreliable chavs on shows such as Jeremy Kyle

I'd hate to promote a stereotype, but if this country wants to deport the thousands of asian doctors saving British lives everday, and give the job to 'Brenda', who is too busy with 4 kids from unknown fathers, then it can bloody well do so....

EDIT: Throwing out citizens who have come from the Middle East will inevitably cut off ties with the Middle East in terms of trade etc. So that means no oil, and of course the country can sink into a dark age   <--- (a patronising smile for the pro BNP-ists who don't get sarcasm....)

On a general scale, any economy functions best when the best workers are working in their particular areas of expertise.

Hence, the country cannot function as successfully if we are limiting talent in any sector with regard to their nationality or heritage. The best worker should get the job, and that's a good ultimatum to stand by for the hardest work.

It isn't at all practical to refer to 'the past' to try and justify segregation in modern-Britain. This isn't the past, that's the integral point. There is a much wider range of industry, new industries, new specific skills are required, etc etc.

Life according to the BNP:

The EU is full of Nazis

The BNP is Churchill bravely fighting these Nazis

What a load of crap

The advert only looks good because they make their policies seem like this:

-Nobody is wrongly mistreated

When their policies are actually this:

-Stop immigrants from entering the country
-Take out the immigrants that are already in here
-Give the jobs to the unreliable chavs on shows such as Jeremy Kyle

I'd hate to promote a stereotype, but if this country wants to deport the thousands of asian doctors saving British lives everday, and give the job to 'Brenda', who is too busy with 4 kids from unknown fathers, then it can bloody well do so....

I hope I haven't offended anybody by writing this, but it's a subject that I do feel strongly about...

 

I agree with you! Despite the fact that Labour is corrupt, I'd rather vote for them anyday, rather than the racist BNP. The UK has been a multi-ethinic society for hundreds of years, so what is the problem now?

I'd like to ask what you think constitutes 'excessive' freedom of speech. You agree with free speech...unless they're saying things you really disagree with?
Either you agree with free speech, or you don't. There is perhaps room for compromise in the most extreme situations, such as matters of national security, but if you'd like to restrict the freedom for people such as the BNP to promote their political opinions you fall firmly in the latter category. What gives you the right to say your opinion is more valid than theirs?

I don't see any contradiction in what I've said. I don't see how the BNP's free expression in any way takes away the rights of others. Yes, they would like to take away people's freedoms, if they had the chance, but to take away their democratic rights in the name of those they would like to oppress is, well, hypocritical and self-defeating. We really just have to have faith that democracy will prevent them from ever gaining power.
 
 
FFS.

Nearly every political party has a youth wing. It's standard.

& the people feel that the BNP shouldn't exist are more repulsive than the BNP itself tbh.

Discuss, the BNP need to be put straight?

I seem to be repeating myself a lot.

'Excessive' freedom of speech is that which insights hated and contradicts the Public Order Act 1986. Hence being lawfully excessive and nothing at all to do with opinion, agreement or disagreement. I'm referring to my legal rights as a citizen.

I'll explicitly state where the contradiction lies. If 'freedom of speech' is used to justify hate speech, then you are taking the rights away from those who are the victims of said hate speech! Freedom of speech cannot co-exist with hate speech law.

It's what one perceives as the most important aspect of society. Protecting people from hatred, or protecting peoples rights to be allowed to insight hatred. And, well... why would anyone support hatred? It's just that egocentric attitude of 'I can say what I want' that doesn't translate into a fair society, IMO.
 
 
Its election time and the BNP is in a position of relative strength. There's bound to be more interest than usual.

I wonder how long before they get their Hugo Boss uniforms, oh wait, that's German (*shock*), Ted Baker then.

I don't really think it is THAT big a deal though, because if you think about it, the kind of parents who send their children to Youth BNP meetings are probably going to be bringing them up to hate non-white people/non-Christian people/non-British people/non-heterosexual people anyway.
 
 
So I guess only white people fought for this country in the past and the present?

Even so, it's getting a bit over the top. I wish we could just create one massive BNP thread and all BNP threads get merged into that one. It's essentially always the same issue. It's never anything different other than: 'They're so racist' or 'Why does everyone hate them?'. If this was any other thread, you'd get a mass of angry TSR people going 'GOD USE THE SEARCH FUNCTION ALREADY'.
 
 
i always wondered what the BNP's policy towards the Gurkhas was ?

would they be pro letting them stay as they have served our country, or want to kick them out like all the rest ?

Actually, he's head of Publicity now:

You are failing to differentiate with speech you simply disagree with/offends people; and actually inciting people to be violent. The two are very different. Just because a particular form of speech is anti-women or anti-black or whatever doesn't mean that it automatically falls foul of legislation

You can make the argument that the current heroin epidemic in the UK was partly caused by the ready availability of heroin smuggled in by Pakistani immigrants.

Of course, you can make the much more compelling argument that the heroin epidemic was caused by the refusal of the government to prescribe heroin to addicts leading to a black market. This then allows non-addicts to get hold of heroin and causes spiralling addiction. But it's one of the less-objectionable claims in that broadcast.

It isn't "militant Islam" or Islam in general that is causing a heroin epidemic; it is the demand from British customers and the importation from Asian countries. Blaming Islam for a rise in the use of heroin is like blaming Catholicism for a rise in cocaine.

Why pointless?

If UKIP are successful in the euro elections then it might make the Conservatives (and the other political parties) think twice about there EU stance.
It would also send out a clear message to the rest of Europe that there is growing disconsent about how the EU is run and that it needs to change or face the consequences (such as the recent re-emergence of extremist nationalist politics...the BNP being the obvious example here in the UK).

As for suggesting the BNP have a more "mature" attitude, well you are entitled to your beliefs, but i'd hardly call the BNP's agenda on withdrawal from the EU "mature".

For a start the BNP want to simply withdraw from the EU and divert all trade agreements back to commonwealth nations such as Australia, NZ, Canada etc. The potential flaws to that idea are numerous; Would any of these countries want our trade commodities when they have to be transported to the other side of the world (Australia and New Zealand) to get them? That is costly and I don't think Australia or New Zealand would be interested since they have now focused on building trade links with neighbouring Asian countries. It just wouldn't be worth there while and I can't really think of any commodities we could offer them that they would be interested in or could get elsewhere for much cheaper. I think trade would be very limited and certainly couldn't replace the economic benefits we recieve from the EU.

Now of course UKIP have also stated they'd like to re-establish trade with the commonwealth, but the major difference being that they realise that it's totally unrealistic to depend on the commonwealth entirely. This is why they favour following the 4 countries in the EFTA (European Free Trade Agreement) which still keeps the free trade agreements with all EU states but removes all political power away from Brussels and restores political sovereignty and independence. The EFTA agreement would also mean that the UK wouldn't have to conform entirely to laws on labour and immigration, though all the 4 members of the EFTA (Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland) give concessions to most EU citizens (except newer member states such as Romania) and allow them to work in there country without a visa. Usually they only require work permits that are good for one year and can be renewed indefinitely (Switzerland) or 3 year residence permits in the case of Norway. Iceland doesn't require permits for EU citizens.

So very basically being in the EFTA gives countries the benefit to pick and choose and greater flexibility and certainly much more independence in decisions on law and immigration.

Of course skeptics will point at Iceland's recent economic crash and claim that is evidence that EU membership and joining the Euro is vital to a countries economic development...Personally I don't think if Iceland had the Euro or not it would've prevented that, but even if it would've and the EU membership does bring greater economic power I don't think in a million years it's worth surrendering our sovereignty and political independence for that.

Eh, you're supporting UKIP now, after that diatribe in the polls thread?
 
 
BUT, if 'anti-black' speech is accepted in the principle of 'freedom of speech', don't that not go on to incite violence regardless.

Look at American pre-civil rights. They had a damn good amount of freedom of speech. Should we follow their example?

I wouldn't read it as that at all, at least at face value.
"Good people, regardless of colour" should come first- people who contribute to society are the ideal citizens, whatever their skin colour.
"spongers and new arrivals who've never lifted a finger to help build this country" - people who don't contribute aren't welcome. It's an ambiguous statement, but not necessarily labelling all immigrants as spongers. It depends whether you hear it listing two groups as "spongers" and "new arrivals" and claiming neither group has lifted a finger to help the country. Or hear it as referring to "spongers" and "new arrivals who've never lifted a finger to help build this country " (as opposed to new arrivals who contribute).

 
Otherwise, except for the bit about new arrivals, that seems to be contradicting the text on screen as those words were spoken - "British jobs for British workers".
 

I don't see how it's a contradiction.   The video claims they consider ethnic minorities who have been settled here long term to be British. You can still want British jobs for British workers, and accept that there will be some immigration. The slogan wants preference for British jobs to go to British workers, it doesn't necessarily mean all working immigrants are unwelcome.

P.P.S. The thing I don't get about nazis is that they blame everything on the jews but when they kicked out all the jews that didn't create a utopia. In fact they lost a war which is strange since they're meant to have been genetically superior.

Incidentally this is one of the problems I have with terms like "broken society" that the Tories and BNP like to use. Getting drunk three nights in a row isn't anti-social behaviour, it isn't damaging, it isn't immoral, it's just fun and they should deal with it and crack down on ACTUAL anti-social behaviour, like, you know, hanging round on street corners in groups of 15 and ambushing innocent people while completely sober. That's anti-social behaviour, not house parties. Alcohol is so much less of a problem than the Government wants to admit it is and yet they keep targeting it (and cannibis and tobacco) because they think they are going to change something... maybe if they actually punished people and kept retard chavs in line, there wouldn't be anti-social behaviour problems, alcohol or no alcohol...

From what I can see, neither UKIP or the BNP hold any influence over EU policy, so its not really relevant which one you vote for. In which case, I would go for UKIP as they are less racist.

I generally vote for the Greens though.

Couldn't agree more   but we do have a "broken society" but not because of alcohol and drugs but because of yobs who think its ok to be violent.

I do admire UKIP on some of their policies - mainly education and Europe - but you do realise they will fall apart when Nigel Farage quits as leader??
 
 
I don't agree that we have a "broken society" I just think we have a "broken state" and yes, I do realise that.
 
 
Do NOT vote BNP as a protest, particularly if you're in Yorkshire and the Humber or the North West. There is a serious chance of them getting a seat.
 
 
The BNP scare me, have a read of their manifesto sometime.

What you are doing is completely shifting the blame. If people commit a violent act, that is there responsibility. If you punch me, it is no defence that you got told by your friend to do it.
Admittedly actually inciting people to commit violence is different. But the BNP aren't inciting violence. There is a big difference between inciting people to violence, and spouting content that you consider morally objectionable. Incitals to violence is a good ground to deny freedom of speech; the mere fact that speech is "extreme" (i.e. you disagree with it) is not a good ground on which to deny freedom of speech. This is not 1984, we don't have thought crimes.

Regarding civil rights, clearly blacks did not have equal civil rights nor full freedom of speech in times past. Thats a very flawed analogy. The denial of civil rights to blacks has absolutely nothing to do with freedom of speech; its completely irrelevant.

I can't see that any rights are being taken away by hate speech.

It is true though that freedom of speech and hate-speech-laws are not compatible though. I would support hatred without a second thought. You, on the other hand, are so hypocritical. You clearly hate the BNP to the extent that you want to restrict their rights, so how are you really any different?

And without hiding behind the law, how would YOU define excessive freedom of speech.
 
 
Can we make the BNP a banned topic on TSR? I get sick of seeing about 4 of these threads every time I come onto the forum.

I mean you cant really trust politicians but its gotta be better then the BNP!

A start is no good when it still comes to nothing. And does Cameron's attitude have anything to do with the election coming up, d'you think? I think he is playing to the gallery... saying what the Tory grassroots wants to hear. Brown and Blair seemed pretty set on a referendum too until it actually mattered, and I didn't believe them either.

 
I mean you cant really trust politicians but its gotta be better then the BNP!
 

I agree, you can't trust politicians. It's a matter of choosing the ones you distrust the least. That doesn't mean I'm voting BNP!

UKIP's immigration policy is not racist. The BNP's is. Whilst both want an independent country in order to put their policies in action, those policies are very different.

  Another BNP thread.
 
 
Other political parties have youth wings, so I cannot really understand the shock that people are expressing on this thread.

Scouting and shooting are both traditional past-times, and kids enjoy them, so what is wrong with such activities?

I'm not a BNP supporter, but I still think it's a bit foolish to say they hate all of Europe.

They loathe the EU, but seem very fond of far-right nationalists of France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden and many others.

Google 'Euronat' for more information.

The central belief of the BNP is ethnic nationalism, and their definition of British seems to be anyone of Anglo-Saxon, Nordic, Celtic or likewise Western European descent.

Granted, they don't seem overly fond of Slavic groups like Romanians, Albanians, Moldavians and the like. They're ambiguous towards Poles but seem quite amicable to Russians.

Not unless you hold that there is some sort of human right not to be offended. Which is completely unworkable as a principle.

I for one feel more demeaned and offended by your views than the BNP's.

 
I actually find the existence of the BNP very suspect also, and question as to how they are allowed to exist. Is hate speech not illegal?!
 

Define your terms. Breaching the peace is illegal. Inciting racial hatred - an ill-defined and largely pointless offence - is also illegal. Neither apply to the BNP.
 
 
Its in answer to the admirable but possibly wrong action taken by the CofE leadership.

I agree with your sentiment but to be honest they asked for it. Religion and politics should not mix as much as has been done today.

Yes, it's the Mail, but none of the other articles were very informative. I've provided a BBC one for you aswell!

 http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/arti...chbishops.html

Britain's two most senior Church leaders will today plead with the public not to vote for the British National Party in next month’s European elections in protest at MPs’ lavish expenses.

In a rare joint statement, the Archbishops of Canterbury and York will acknowledge the ‘understandable’ anger that the furore over Commons allowances has caused.

But Dr Rowan Williams and Dr John Sentamu will say that at a time of ‘extraordinary turbulence’ voters must avoid rewarding the ‘divisive’ BNP.

Their unprecedented intervention follows an opinion poll showing that more than a quarter of the electorate are planning to reject the Westminster Establishment in the June 4 elections.

In their statement, the Archbishops say: ‘The temptation to stay away or register a protest vote in order to send a negative signal to the parties represented at Westminster will be strong.

‘In our view, however, it would be tragic if the understandable sense of anger and disillusionment with some MPs over recent revelations led voters to shun the ballot box.’

They say it is ‘crucial’ to elect people who wish to uphold democratic values and work for the ‘common good in a spirit of public service’, which they say ‘urgently needs to be reaffirmed in these difficult days’.

The Archbishops say in the statement: ‘Christians have been deeply disturbed by the conscious adoption by the BNP of the language of our faith...to foster fear and division...especially between people of different faiths or racial backgrounds.

‘This is not a moment for voting in favour of any political party whose core ideology is about sowing division in our communities and hostility on grounds of race, creed or colour.’

The statement follows a newspaper article in which Dr Williams attacked MPs who defend excessive expense claims by insisting that ‘no rules were broken’.

Writing in The Times, he called for a return to personal integrity, but he also said it was time to stop humiliating politicians or risk seriously damaging the democratic system.
 

Should the Church be meddling in politics, and telling people who they should and should not vote for?

Personally, I think this action is counter-productive as they are emphasising this sense of the 'establishment'. Shouldn't they try and fill up the empty pews, instead of attempting to preach political morality?
 
 
don't they realise they are giving the BNP the free publicity they crave?!
 
 
people may vote for the BNP because of it...
 
 
Well I suppose they had to respond to it in order to inform people that the BNP are not actually promoting Christian values at all. People who are saying that the church should not get involved in politics- well the BNP should not be using religion for their own political gain.
 
 
Seriously, something needs to be done with all the BNP threads that keeps popping up. If people are so desperate to extol the virtues of the BNP or berate them - I'm not fussed either way - why can't it be kept to one thread? It's exasperating to see three new threads pop up a day, all of which end up descending into the same arguments for and against BNP. Whether one likes it or not, we do live in a free country (for now that is) where one can vote freely for whichever political party takes their fancy. We also live in a [slightly] free country where freedom of speech reigns, if the Archbishops want to say that he finds the BNP repugnant, then he is quite entitled to say so. Likewise if Nick Griffith wants to say that all black people are criminals or whatever the usual crap it is he says, then he is free to say so. We can either take on their words as pearls of wisdom or dismiss them - either way we don't need threads upon threads picking over every little matter regarding the BNP. It's tedious.

we don't even live in an officially secular country, and the government wont even let incitement to hatred cover the churches anti-homosexuality outbursts, yet the church is protected by law.

its not should they, they always have.
 
 
Funny how many members of the BNP have that nostalgia about the Church and Old England. The BNP members I have met (usually the more mature members) want the Church to be at the center of government.

Funny.

Here's the thing about all churches: if you don't believe in it then you really don't have to listen to what they say.

However, I also want to say that if everyone is entitled to speak their mind about any issue they want, as protected by law, then why are the COE being hounded for just stating their opinion?

Excuse the pun but they're damned if they do and they' re damn if they don't.

I happen to agree with what they, The COE, say for once.

BNP are a bunch of divisive trolls who gain support through the propagation of fear and hate.

I, however, afford them the right to "have their say" which is quite right even if I don't agree with it. I just others would afford a similar courtesy to rather better bunch of men and women over at the COE even if you don't agree with religion.

This thread is more in relation to the Church and politics than simply a BNP discussion.

It will inevitably turn into a heated debate on BNP policies though, they always do.

But keeping in line with the current topic, I think the church is quite right to discuss matters playing on their conscience. After all, it was the BNP who brought the church into the fray in the first place with their "what would Jesus do?" adverts. Something which most theologians would probably feel completely misrepresents Jesus and Christianity.
 
 
I feel the Church has the right to issue comments upon moral issues, of which the issue of the BNP definitely is.
 
 
I'm not sure what would be worse: people listening to the opinions of a dillusional political party with morally questionable views, or a bunch of religious zealots who use the word of a ficticious character as an excuse for morally questionable actions.

I love it how no one is just Religious - they are infact zealots!

I'm not just British but I'm British zealot!
I'm not just hungry but I'm a hungry zealot!
I'm not just pedantic but I'm a pedantic zealot!

This isn't just zeal - it's a marks and spencers approved zeal!

Go be dangerous somewhere else Ian - I'm afraid you're only in danger of being laughed at here.
 
 
I don't think it's quite far to say that the Church is "meddling" in politics in this instance; rather, they are commenting on a moral issue. Their comments will probably only be properly valued by Christians anyway, most of whom would not vote BNP in the first place.
 
 
Why are people allowed to act like the BNP towards the BNP but not the other way around?
 
 
immigrants probably will leave voluntarily if racist feeling is so high
 
 
The policy is anyone willing to integrate will stay, those who don't will be paid to leave, they aren't going to force anyone though. (well that's what they say anyway..)
 
 
i don't really think the church should be active in politics, though if they want to make this statement then they of course should be able to do so.

It kinda made me laugh that they blame the BNP for being 'divisive' - No, the ones that are divisive are the successive labour and tory governments that have created division through mass immigration. Without them we would not be divided.

Yes because most people are interested in what the Church of England has to say on 'moral matters'.
 
 
I despise it when the Church attempts to break-through the walls of their establishment and extend their authority past the boundaries of their congregation. Their teachings should be limited to the brainless crowd of pensioners that make their way to mass every week, and their teachings should not have political agendas.
 
 
They'll be deported.

Spoiler:
TO A GAS CHAMBER
 
 
When the Church do nothing they're useless and out-of-touch with society, when they say something (even if it is something completely sane and within their rights to do) they get berated by hungry atheists seeking to score a cheap shot.

I'm an atheist too, but that doesn't mean the Church has to be irrelevant or constantly hounded with Dawkins-esque methods seeking to destroy a relatively sane and liberal branch of Christianity.

[
 
I'm not sure what would be worse: people listening to the opinions of a dillusional political party with morally questionable views, or a bunch of religious zealots who use the word of a ficticious character as an excuse for morally questionable actions.
 

CoE =/= entirety of Christianity (et vice versa), you know that right?

Also,
 
Here's the thing about all churches: if you don't believe in it then you really don't have to listen to what they say.

However, I also want to say that if everyone is entitled to speak their mind about any issue they want, as protected by law, then why are the COE being hounded for just stating their opinion?
 

Oh why is this the most correct post in the thread I thought we atheists were the ones trying to be intelligent  
 
 
I think religious institutions should be free to express their opinion on politics. I think religion should be kept out of politics to some extent, but the fact is that a significant proportion of the voters are religious so of course their religion will come into it for them.

They certainly are. One of the most trusted institutions in the land.
 
 
Neither is supposed to be allowed to do either on this forum beyond a certain point. In real life there's not really an adequate answer in my view.

Like whom? Whom would it push towards the BNP?

Regarding whether the Church should have commented, I don't see a problem with it. Unlike their comments about short-selling in the financial crisis (where they were speaking out of ignorance), politics is a public matter which everyone is free to discuss and comment on.
 
 
If they were smart, they'd look to get re-elected, and so wouldn't be relatively hard-line, i.e. forcing them out. They'll offer them money to leave. I'm not sure how that would work. If they paid them to leave in advance, a lot of people would just keep the money. If promised to pay them afterwards, they would just wait for them to leave and then not pay up.

They could also use some catastrophe like the need to combat climate change or terrorism to force them all out, regardless of what they promise in their manifesto.

I hardly think the country would stop functioning without ethnic minorities.

These sort of posts strike me as a bit odd. Clearly you're not familiar with the BNP's policy on this matter (which is not as you suggest it is) yet feel the need to pretend you do. Why?

Hence, the country cannot function as successfully if we are limiting talent in any sector with regard to their nationality or heritage. The best worker should get the job, and that's a good ultimatum to stand by for the hardest work.

 

You're making two glaring logical errors here:

1. In getting rid of a certain ethnic group, you're not only removing the ones of talent, but also the ones with no talent. Unless you are suggesting that ethnic minorities are somehow more intelligent than white people, removing them would not make any difference at all in terms of maintaining the existing level of workforce competence. There would simply be fewer people.

2. You did not talk about success in your first post, you talked about survival. Britain could 'function' just fine without quite so many talented people as it has.

LOL, what sort of a person does things like that? I didn't state whether it was right or wrong. I simply stated my opinion on what would happen to Britsh born ethnic minorites if the BNP were ever elected. How is that malicious? Anyway, what sort of person quotes only half of statements?

It seems inherently unsustainable to me as well as morally dubious.

I don't mean to sound patronising but please have a think about why we import low skill labour into this country when we have plenty of low skilled, unemployed people sitting around on benefits? Who does immigration really benefit? is it the country as a whole or is it more about using free markets to drive down wages and maximise profits.... i think i know the answer to this one.

 

Minorities outstrip (in number) people who are unemployed. Meaning there's more jobs than the British population.

How would the BNP be more effective in parliament than UKIP?

Doesn't matter that much anyway, it is not like the parliament does anything. Voting UKIP just makes me feel slighty better about the situation, but unless things change a lot the EU will be totally running Britain pretty soon.

The Conservatives don't have a European policy!
They just ignore it!

Vote UKIP on June 4th

The main goal (as I'm sure you're aware) is a common economy, and for that to happen, as you know, we need a little more than just a free trade area.

The EU has also taken on some responsibility for the environment (which considering our gvt. is doing naff all, is also a good thing).

apart from that (as far as I know) the EU doesn't have anything to do with social policy.
 
 
Gurkhas, and there are other ethnic groups other than whites who fight in our wars in this day and age.

Actually they fought to prevent British people being taken over by right wing fascists. Incidentally they fought alongside 'third worlders'. Britain's colonies contributed 2.5 million soldiers to WWI.

What happens if that stupid slogan, 'Put British people first' include the ethnic minority people who were born in Britian? Will they be snubbed and will an apartheid occur?

 

They'll actually get 72 hours to gather what posessions they can and leave the country. Those that refuse to do so will be sent to forced labor camps or used in medical experiments.
 
 
It is better to vote for anything rather than vote for the BNP in the EU elections.
 
 
Whilst I personally would rather vote for a rabid hamster to represent my country in Europe, it must be said that UKIP's ideas of an independent Britain (However outdated it may be) come from evidence that it would improve the economy and lives of the British, as opposed to the BNP's, frankly rather Daily Mail-esque ideas of "Different? What do you mean Different? England is for the English! God save the Queen!" that bear no resemblance with modern Britain, and are really, lets be honest, just a little bit racist.

Racist leanings? A leader with a very questionable character? Lots of supporters who go "Yeah! Too right!" at gatherings? An intolerance of anything even remotely different? Lots of "Science" to back up their far out ideas? Holocaust Denial? Anti-Homosexuality? And now a youth branch? Now that reminds me of an organization. Hmmm... I can't remember which one though....
 
 
Lol, I just got this email from the BNP:

 
BNP website taken offline in largest cyber attack in recorded history!
We need your help IMMEDIATELY!
Fellow Patriot,

The main BNP website was offline for a short period due to an unprecedented Denial of Service Attack, the likes of which have only ever been seen before in 2001 when Microsoft’s website was brought down under similar circumstances.

The site was first attacked on Saturday night, at one point dealing with 28 million hits, but we managed to block out the traffic which was emanating from Eastern Europe and Russia.

The size of the renewed assault is unparalleled and there is no doubt that whoever has organised this has had to pay out a serious amount of money to the criminal underworld.

On Friday the servers of Clear Channel, part of a huge conglomerate that provides billboard advertising to the BNP, suffered a similar attack. Their IT professionals tracked the criminal activity back to a notorious "anti-fascist" organisation openly aligned to the Labour Party and supported by the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats. This organisation was protesting at the decision by Clear Channel to allow the BNP to display advertising in support of our European Election Campaign.

As a consequence of the criminal actions against Clear Channel we understand that their legal team is currently in the process of issuing writs against the perpetrators which as well as civil actions will involve the possibility of potential criminal charges including racketeering.

> > Help us fight back against the Marxist cyber criminals! Click here to donate now! > >
The attack on the BNP website is an indication of the increasing desperation of our opponents, who, unable to defeat us in democratic debate, would rather just have us closed down. BUT THEY WILL NEVER WEAKEN OUR RESOLVE TO WIN BACK OUR COUNTRY!

The rising popularity of the BNP’s website (just before the attack started, the site’s web rankings had broken through the 20,000 most popular site in the world mark, and 1.600 in the UK) was obviously simply too much for the alliance of Communists, Tories, Labour, Lib-Dem and UKIP old parties to bear, hence the decision to try and close it down by illegal means.

Our website is now back online thanks to the legendary efforts of our cyber team, led by BNP Webmaster Simon Bennett. However, this entirely new and unexpected criminal attack on our hugely popular website has alerted us to new dangers that must be neutralised IMMEDIATELY.

Our website is still under massive attack and keeping it online is causing enormous strain on the time and resources of our internet department. It could crash again at any moment.

WE NEED TO GET THIS PROBLEM SORTED IMMEDIATELY AS THE CRIMINALS BEHIND THIS WILL NO DOUBT WANT TO TAKE OUR WEBSITE OFFLINE BEFORE OUR BROADCASTS ARE SHOWN ON TV TOMMORROW!

> > Help us fight back against the Marxist cyber criminals! Click here to donate now! > >
We have been forced to hire a Cyber Defence expert who is skilled in prevention of the kinds of internet attacks we have just experienced. On top of this, we also need to invest in additional hardware and servers. We MUST pay for these critical items immediately in order to prevent our website being taken offline again, and for this we need YOUR HELP.

We simply cannot afford to pay for these additional items because every penny we possess is allocated to the Euro Election Campaign.

If you want to see the BNP website safe and secure we need your help immediately - we cannot waste any more time. We have priced up the cost of hiring a Cyber Defence expert and also the extra servers and hardware: we need £5,000.

> > Help us fight back against the Marxist cyber criminals! Click here to donate now! > >
The choice is very simple and I hate to be blunt: either everyone reading this digs deep and makes a donation that will help to get to £5,000 very quickly or our website will no doubt be taken down again by the cyber criminals. Considering we have, at the moment, around 200,000 hits per week on our website this will be a huge waste of valuable enquiries - imagine how many people won't be able to get in touch when our broadcasts are aired on TV tomorrow! That's what is at stake!!

I have personally donated £250 to this appeal to set things in motion, stand with me now, we cannot allow our countries enemies to do this again! Please send your most generous gift immediately.
 
 
 
Hahaha, regardless of whether this actually happened to them or not how full of blatant propagandist crap can you get?

"Donate now to stop the evil commies"
 
 
I was actually going to vote BNP in Euro Elections until I saw this:

Griffin is taking BNP members, supporters and voters for a ride of his own sick, deceitful agenda.

I'll be voting UKIP now.

Also just because businesses want to employ more people (IF thats the case) doesn't mean the state should bend immigration controls to fit those needs. It has higher national concerns to consider.

But the BNP would happily throw them out... even if theydon't 'inherit', why shouldn't they be allowed to settle?

They do get paid for it you know. It's not as if they are press-ganged into service.

Indeed. I'm very concerned that youngsters are being taught such intolerance. These BNP threads are full of extraordinarily intolerant young people calling for outright bans on the BNP. I've never seen such rabid fascism.
