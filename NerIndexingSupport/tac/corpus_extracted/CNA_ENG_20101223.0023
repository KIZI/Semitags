announced Wednesday new guidelines for defining "death from overwork" as an
occupational  disease,  as  part  of  its  efforts  to reduce labor-management
disputes and better protect employees' rights and benefits.

The new guidelines will be applied in the case of a 29-year-old engineer at
Nanya Technology Corp. who died earlier this year, said Fu Huan-jan,  director
of the CLA's Labor Safety and Health Department.

The engineer's relatives have been trying to have his case classified as
"karoshi, " which means "death from overwork" in Japanese, saying that he had
been working constant overtime hours for six months prior to his demise.

The following are excerpts from the local media coverage of the issue:

United Daily News:

Many companies in the high-tech industrial sector often do not keep records of
their employees' work hours on grounds that they adhere to a "responsibility
system." Under this system, which employees are responsible for completing
specific tasks, regardless of the time it takes, and therefore are not eligible
to claim overtime.

This practice has caused controversy from time to time in cases of alleged death
from overwork.

Fu said Wednesday the CLA has decided to change the guidelines for defining
death from overwork and will now place the burden of proof on employers in order
to reduce the incidence of occupational injury and death.

Under the new CLA regulations, the employer will be required to pay compensation
payment to the family of the deceased if the employer is unable to provide solid
evidence that the employee had not been literally worked to death.

The "karoshi" issue was highlighted in January when an engineer at Nanya
Technology Corp. (NTC) was found dead in front of his computer at home. His
parents said he had been putting in about 80 hours of overtime per month for six
months.

Similar cases are not uncommon in the high-tech sector. More often than not, the
family of the deceased is unable to claim labor insurance compensation because
it is difficult for the courts and labor authorities to determine death as a
result of overwork.

The CLA is expected to announce a decision soon in the case of the NTC engineer.
If the CLA rules in favor of the family, the Bureau of Labor Insurance and Nanya
Technology, a DRAM memory chip maker affiliated with the Formosa Plastics Group,
will each have to pay the engineer's family the equivalent of 45 months of his
salary. (Dec. 23, 2010).

Liberty Times:

The CLA said Wednesday it has decided to make it easier for doctors and
investigators to classify a case as death or injury from overwork.

According to Fu, the CLA will follow the standards used in Japan, which include
contributing  factors such as abnormal  working conditions, heavy short-term
overwork, and long-term overwork.

Under these standards, long-term overwork is defined as 92 hours of overtime in
the month before death, or 72 hours of overtime per month for two to six months
before death.

Based on the new guidelines, the range of conditions that could be attributed to
overwork will be expanded to include ischemic heart disease, severe cardiac
arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, sudden cardiac death, cerebral hemorrhage, cerebral
infarction, acute heart failure and aortic rupture. (Dec. 23, 2010).
