I was having this discussion with some friends the other day, talking about what makes a good James Bond and tried to think about who could be the next one, apparently the favourite is Sam Worthington (Avatar) according to the bookies, but I think it would be terrible if he was picked.
Personally I think it should be Clive Owen.
Who would you like to see as the next James Bond?

Clive Owen is too old now, It should be Jeremy Renner (The Hurt Locker)
 
 
Clive Owen is a good choice, Rupert whats-his-name(not Grint, the posh one from Spooks) would be worth a punt I think
 
 
Christian Bale!! At least for a couple of movies.
 
 
Roy Chubby Brown. Naturally.

well, I'd take him over Worthington.
 
 
i agree with clive owen  

i think jonathan rhys meyers would be good too  
 
 
Jeremy Paxman or Boris Johnson.
 
 
Sean Connery

Im not sure other than im not sure it should be an american, unless they have a seriously convincing english accent in the bag

I really quoted just to tell you i'm +repping you for the Blues Brothers quote in your sig   legendary film!
 
 
hahaa. Rupert Grint.

I love Jeremy Renner!  

I think Aaron Johnson. But maybe he's a bit young yet.
 
 
Dominic West.
 
 
i always thought that leonardo dicaprio would be really good. but he's quite successful already but he wouldn't accept the role. the people that take the role tend to be quite obscure actors who are looking for their big break and tend to get famous after taking the role. christian bale might be good and maybe eric bana or colin farrell.

Yeah we thought that might be a problem but Sean Connery and Rodger Moore were pretty old for their last few films, I think he'd be good for at least 2 films.
Renner isn't british though, and unless he can put on a good accent it would be a bit of a shame
 
 
Well they have to be British - don't they. I thought the Bond series had ended anyway, since they put the next Bond movie "on hold indefinitely".
 
 
nothing wrong with Daniel Craig....
 
 
Well he HAS to be British.
So Simon Pegg, Christian Bale, Clive Owen, Roawn Atkinson, Orlando Bloom... etc etc
Too many.

haha thanks, it is a great film, seen it so many times!
 
 
Megan Fox.
 
 
that guy in Avatar...forgot his name, ahhhh, mind freeze
 
 
Henry Cavill  

 

I would do so many wrong things to that man

Daniel Craig is perfectly fine. Were he to leave, I would like to see James McAvoy in the role.

But the canon of the current Bond films occurs way before Goldeneye, meaning he currently is not dead.
 
 
Bruce Forsyth - he's comfortable in a tux, he's smooth, he's British - what's not to like?
"I'm Bond, James Bond, Nice to see you, to see you..."
 
 
Reckon it's time for an ethnic James Bond. Wouldn't want to be racist would we. The UK is after all a diverse, multi culture society.

He should have another go though, he's just that cool :P

That is being racist.
It shouldn't be a factor in the equation.

It was more a note that he's already been in a Bond film as someone who was distinctly not Bond. It'd be quite strange to cast him again as a totally different character.
 
 
Will Smith

Surely it's no weirder than having a character's race change several times throughout the franchise, or the personality of the main character to flip over more times than a schizophrenic? If they wanted to cast Sean Bean, the fact that he's been in it previously wouldn't really be that much of a stumbling block, I wouldn't have thought.
 
 
Kiefer Sutherland. Or Denzel Washington.
 
 
I'd say christian bale, but he's already batman.

also, are they making anotherBond film, I heard MGM went bankrupt
 
 
Martin Clunes.

 
 
 
007 is just a code name, all the other "bonds" died.
 
 
Bill Nighy

Yeah, they were mid-production of another Craig 1 when that happened. Presumably it's just a matter of waiting until someone else carries on from where MG left off.
 
 
british bloke in inception would be just dandy
 
 
Matt Lucas
Boris Johnson
Alan Rickman! :P

Anyone but Daniel Craig tho seriously   lols

Hmm, most plausible however; I think Alun Davies would have more longevity.

*sigh*

Scottish is British.

Certainly more British than the Irish Brosnan.

Outside shot: Andrew Lincoln.
However, since they're focusing more on the gritty side these days [since competing with Bourne] they'd need someone more suited to the action side of things [counts out 99% of current young actors] without looking out of place in a tux [there goes Statham].
 
 
Pierce Brosnan  
 
 
Frankie Boyle.
 
 
Bradley James
 
 
Al Murray or Johnny Vegas
 
 
I think Jack Davenport wouldn't make a bad James bond, he might not have a tough look as such at the moment, but he can do stuff as seen in Pirates of The Caribbean. I think his voice would suit the role too.

Whoever it is would have to be British I think and not be emotionless like Jason Stratham.
 
 
Boris could always be the new M and Paxman Q.
 
 
Tom Hardy.

Some of you may know him as Eames from Inception.

I don't think he's refined enough to play Bond.

Incidentally, Cilian Murphy would be an excellent Bond villain.

Hmm, I can see why you say that but when I see or hear Daniel Craig I don't see much refinement either

Really? Daniel Craig is all about refinement, in my eyes. If you look at Layer Cake, by playing his role in such a composed way he elevates that film to far more than it would have been without him.

Contrast that to Tom Hardy, who has shown he is a great actor but has never really showed a role that is played at anything other than face value.

I probably don't understand what you mean by refinement, I take it as playing a smooth character that still has an aura of mystery about them?

Yeah, pretty much. I think the character of Bond should give you that feeling that they would be prepared to kill you in a heartbeat masked by the epitome of english charm. Connery and Craig both have this, which is what makes them so good, whereas people like Moore only managed half of the equation. It's not really a character which can be played straight, you have to be able to layer it and be subtly menacing (which I would call being refined, as opposed to just raw talent). Tom Hardy is fantastic in things like Bronson, but I don't think he could take that menace and cover it.

P.S. Hi Barca!   I haven't spoken to you in ages (probably not since the WUM thread   ), how's things?

P.P.S. I do think it was an interesting suggestion by the way, I'm not disagreeing with you to try and prove you wrong, merely discussing it with you because I enjoy talking to you.

Yeah, Roger Moore was like a jolly Bond tbh, had all the charm but none of the menace you talk about.

Things are fine mate, don't see you in the European footy thread much though   Btw I'm applying for Graduate entry medicine, seeing as you are a med student I could really use some pointers with regards to my personal statement that I'm trying to start

I think the producers were aware of Roger Moore's failings as well; in some of his films you can almost see where someone has decided that Bond doesn't seem dangerous enough, so they include these really odd snippets of him snapping someone's neck completely out of character, which when you notice it seems so odd. But then a lot of the Bond films are complete messes.

Yeah, European football's been something I've kind of overlooked recently (I kind of lost interest in La Liga when Valencia started going off the boil   ), I should probably get back into it at some point.

Great news about the medical application!   Where abouts are you thinking of applying *cough cough* come to Oxford   ? I would of course be happy to give you any advice I can (although I don't know too much about the GEM system), feel free to PM me anytime.

I dunno about Moore being the jolly Bond. He's certainly the most hammy of the Bonds, but I think he could be genuinely threatening at times. He's really quite intimidating in The Man with the Golden Gun, just watch the bit where he's slapping Maud Adams about the room for information.

I don't honestly know who I want for the next Bond. I didn't think Daniel Craig would be any good and I was proven very wrong, so I don't think I have the best foresight when it comes to these things. Bond is probably a relatively easy character to cast - the next candidate for M is a much more interesting question, I think.
 
 
Christian Bale.
 
 
clive owen could have done a really good turn as bond. not as brawny as craig though(which in the end was what they were looking for), a more thinking mans version - in the guise of early bond.

i disagree about tom hardy, i think he could portray the charm and menace as well. his character in inception was so debonair..

also.. dominic cooper. i think this guy is underrated and captain america next year could be his breakout role.
 
 
Jude Law?

I don't think I've ever seen a scene where Moore has looked anything even approaching threatening.

I also don't understand why a lot of people thought Craig wouldn't do a good job; in previous roles he showed menace, intelligence, sophistication, coolness, the whole package. Is it just because he was blonde?

Too many.

 

Rowan Atkinson or Simon Pegg?

just so not bond. i can't think of anyone cool enough though, but certainly not those

i say bring back roger moore, even though he is 100

He wouldn't be a terrible choice. The coolness of his performance in Talented Mr Ripley mixed with his now more action-heavy performances in things like Repo Men and he could do alright.
