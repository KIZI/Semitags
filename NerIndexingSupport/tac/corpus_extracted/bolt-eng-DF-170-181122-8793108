The world's astonishment and anger has barely subsided in the past four months since the abrupt release from Scottish prison of the "Lockerbie bomber." It hardly seems possible this ham-handed mishandling of justice could get any worse, but now, the only man ever to be convicted for the deaths of 270 people aboard Pan Am #103... has gone missing?
The London Times reports Abdel Baset al-Megrahi cannot be found in his home in Tripoli, in the nearby hospital, or by telephone.

The surreal horror of what happened in Lockerbie twenty years ago is a grainy memory for most people, if it's remembered at all. Emergency personnel and forensics experts said the bomb in the cargo hold ripped the plane apart, pressure expanded and then collapsed the passengers' lungs, and they took two minutes to fall to earth. Many did not die a merciful immediate death. There were 147 who were still alive after the bomb blast, one worker found a passenger who was clutching a handful of grass.
The Lockerbie villagers spent many traumatic days unable to move the dead bodies on their streets, draped over their porch railings or in their gardens, as the investigation was conducted.

He is heading for Illinois
 
 
 
Is it true that there is a nuclear power plant 20 miles from that prison in Illinois?
 
 
You mean he hasn't died yet?

I am shocked

He's on a beach somewhere with a cold one, laughing his ass off.
 
 
I thought he had died...about 3-4 weeks ago.

I guess not.

I thought he, the Lockerbie Bomber, was hired by Obama and Obama's advisers, to layout the new hotel, tennis courts, sauna's and golf course, for the Gitmo Gang when they arrive.
