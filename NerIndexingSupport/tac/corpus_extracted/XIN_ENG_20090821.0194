Guatemalan authorities have arrested a former senior police commander on a
charge of stealing 119 kg of cocaine from National Civilian Police (PNC)
storehouses, according to news reaching here on Thursday.

Orlando Evangelista Villatoro was a leader of the PNC's Special Criminal
Investigation Division until the disappearance of 119 kg of cocaine from a one-
ton shipment that had been seized early this month, according to statements on
the PNC website.

The missing drugs were worth more than 1 million U.S. dollars, according to data
from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.

Guatemalan authorities ordered his arrest on Aug. 6, but Villatoro fled and was
on the run until arrested Tuesday. He was wanted by police for racketeering,
conspiracy to trade, and store illegal drugs as well as theft.

Guatemala's Interior Ministry has fired the PNC's four senior officers,
including Villatoro, over the case. Police are investigating another 23 PNC
officers for possible connections with the crimes.
