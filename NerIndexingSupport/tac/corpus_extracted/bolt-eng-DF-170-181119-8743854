 NeoNazi/AZ GOP connection exposed through Racist Anti Immigrant Law 

May 13, 2010 -- Arizona -- Evidence that Arizona's new anti-immigrant law was was written and introduced to Arizona congress by Neo Nazi supporters has come to light. Arizona State Senator Russell Pearce, who submitted the bill has, for many years, been associated with local Neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups. Look at his background.

In 2006, he came out speaking enthusiastically about the 1950’s deportation act “Operation Wetback” and for sending email to his supporters reminiscing the greatness of this program. In this email he included an attachment from a white supremacy group and made the conspiratorial claim that journalists pushed the view of: “a world in which every voice proclaims the equality of the races, the inerrant nature of the Jewish ‘Holocaust’ tale, the wickedness of attempting to halt the flood of non-White aliens pouring across our borders…”
 
 
 
 
 
Yeap often in Republican law writing
 
 
Byrd.
 
 
Nice article written by Moses Apsan. Oh wait that guy has been caught lying about stuff like this in the past, bad article then.
 
 
Document your claim
 
 
 
Document your claim

 

Lair, lair, pants on fair?  
 
 
I didnt think you guys could document your claim
 
 
 
Document your claim

 

So since Obama spent 20 YEARS in Wrights racist church, called Wright a closer personal family friend, a mentor and dedicated at least one of his books to him can we now announce that every law he signs into being is a racist law?

Just wondering?
 
 
 
Document your claim

 

As soon as he documents his accurately, which as usual he didn't...he just drew vauge connections that dont exist.

Go read up on some of his writings and you will see the pattern....it would be like me asking you to trust Sean Hannity is telling the truth about Obama.
 
 
 
I didnt think you guys could document your claim

 

Just like you haven't documented your claim....op-ed doesn't mean it's a fact.
 
 
BS again TM.

The AZ law mirrors Fed law. All 16 pages of it.

If you want proof. Google it yourself. Jeeze.

Just in case this isn't comprehended. What RGS is telling you is that just because someone talked to a person and associated with them doesn't mean Obama shares all his values.

Much like how you try to paint the entire teaparty by a few ridiculous signs that some morons either brought on their own or planted for the very purposes you use them for.
 
 
 Russell Pearce - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 

In October 2006, Russell Pearce forwarded an email from National Alliance, a white separatist group, to a group of supporters. The email titled "Who Rules America" [9] criticized black and white intermixing and Jews in the media for promoting multiculturalism and racial equality, for depicting "any racially conscious White Person" as a bigot, and for presenting the Holocaust as fact.[10] He quickly apologized. The article reports, "He does not agree with the sentiments in the article, but that the title and the first paragraphs about media bias appealed to him. He said the article had been forwarded to him by someone else and he would not have sent it if he had read it in its entirety."[10] He stated in one of his apologies, "Ugly the words contained in it really are. They are not mine and I disavow them completely. Worse still, the website links to a group whose politics are the ugliest imaginable."[10]
In April 2008, Pearce sponsored a measure, Senate Bill 1108, that would prohibit students of Arizona universities and community colleges from forming groups based in whole or part on the race of their membership. Pearce said he didn't want students indoctrinated with seditious or anti-American teachings. Critics have stated that the bill would ban groups that serve minority interests such as the Mexican American study program and the Black Business Students Association.[11]

 Immigration Bill Reflects a Firebrand?s Impact - NYTimes.com 

Hmmm he did write it and sponser it

The state senator who wrote the law, Russell Pearce, had long been considered a politically incorrect embarrassment by more moderate members of his party — often to the delight of his supporters. There was the time in 2007 when he appeared in a widely circulated photograph with a man who was a featured speaker at a neo-Nazi conference. (Mr. Pearce said later he did not know of the man’s affiliation with the group.)
 
 
I just googled his name and it looks like he is a shyster.... Seriously the man does everything from immigration to bankruptcy.... I think he just likes getting publicity...

And yet it is almost Verbatim from the Federal Statute, go figure. I guess next you will be claiming federal law was written by Nazis right?
 
 
 
I just googled his name and it looks like he is a shyster.... Seriously the man does everything from immigration to bankruptcy.... I think he just likes getting publicity...

 

Prove hes a shyster?

Hes a lawyer and that is perfectly legal.

You are smearing him with NO evidence.

There is clear evidence this man is asociated with neo Nazis yet this thread was moved to the conspiracy thread for what reason?
 
 
If its only white people saying this law is not racist then is it racist?

No I said it looks like he is a shyster.... I can say that and its my right...

I did as you asked and googled his name. I told you what it looked like to me. Might be legal but it doesn't make him honest, reliable, trustworthy or anything else. If anything it makes him look shady. He has his hamds in a lot of different things and just like old SHapiro who got OJ off, he looks like a shyster to me... I bet he is going to open a legal website soon like shapiro did....He could call it "immigrationzoom.com"....      

I am not a mod so I can't say for sure why your thread was moved here. BUT, if i were to have to make a bet on it? I would say it got put here because randomly calling AZ state government Nazi Affiliated is along the same lines as saying Obama deliberately blew up an oil rig to get his coming cap and trade bill passed......  
 
 
Because you hate lawyers?

I find it really funny that you wrote a paragraph explaining your opinion to her and all TM sees is "Because you hate lawyers?"

There is no reasoning with idiots, and TM has proven that fact over and over again.

If you thoink its radom then you did not read the evidence.

He is obviously tied to neo nazi groups, he used their info and has pictures with them
 
 
Hey Truthmatters
Read the 1995 bill passed by the Feds. Illegal Immigration Reform & Immigrant Responsibility Act sec. 287 (g) - It gives the right of local law to work with the feds. If you don't like the AZ law get angry at the feds for passing their own law giving the right for local police to work with ICE and boarder patrol.
 
 
 
So you can not give any real reason why you label him a shyster?

 

I just did, in the paragraph I wrote. I explained my reasons for thinking so..

You showed your level of thought and maturity in your responses so far...

So again can we get a warning label for people like you, spidermantuba, and Konradv ? You all act like you are either high in Meth, or too immature to debate honestly....

Picture of Pearce with Neo Nazi

 

And neither are your feelings or his..... See how that works? I never said anything other than how it looked to me.... YOU seem to have a problem differentiating opinion from fact, and evidence from feelings.

He says he thinks there is a nazi connection and gives circumstantial evidence from one guy and calls it proof. YOU take that and say its evidence because you feel its right....

I feel he is a shyster given the fact his name search covered everything from immigration to bankruptcy and even divorce law. I think this and this is how I feel about him. Because of this I take anything he says with a bit of trepidation. I have no real evidence other than how it looks to me.

Just as he has no evidence beyond circumstantial about one person, and you have no evidence beyond how you feel about it....

Now please try and keep the difference between fact and feelings in mind...

This is rock solid evidence folks and NOT feelings
 
 
He is using their written releases and speaking with and applauding them folks.

It was a law written by a guy who loves racists
 
 
 
Document your claim

 

Why don't YOU document Apsan's claim about Senator Pearce?

I'll get you started:  Arizona State Senator Russell Pearce 

I see no reference to him being, allegedly, "associated with local Neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups" as Apsan claimed.
 
 
By TM's reasoning (or lack of reasoning) we MUST assume that ANY law or bill written by Byrd is sponsored by the KKK and is therefore racist.

Rick
 
 
Guys you are really going to deny his own addmissions and documented photos of him appaulding neo nazis?

Hell the neo Nazi praised him by name on the tape.
 
 
I guess we MUST also assume that because Obama spent so many years in Rev. Wright's church that he's also a racist therefore the health care law is racist as well.

Just because someone has associated with someone else doesn't automatically mean they believe all of the same things TM.

Unless you're finally going to admit that Obama has to be a terrorist because of his connection to Ayers you're being an absurd idiot and hypocritical.

Rick
 
 
This man has neo nazi ties and you are defending him.

See how low you have sunk

Here's your idiotic reasoning thrown back at you TM.

Obama has ties to a racist church, and an American terrorist and you constantly defend him.

See how low you have sunk.

Why are you ignoring the FACT that this man posted neo nazi propaganda on his site?

Why are you ignoring pictures and film of him supporting and being supported by a Neo Nazi?

The Neo Nazi praises him by name and they are at a rally together praising each other.

You are pretending listening to a preacher is the same as people actively working together to effect legislation and elections.

This is a REAL neo Nazi and not jsut some preacher you dont like.
 
 
You are so far beyond reason that I'm truly embarrassed for you.

Rick
 
 
This is hard evidence that he is involved with neo nazis.

Tell me how you rationalize ignoring cold hard facts?

Watch the video of a neo Nazi praising him by name and him clapping for the Nazi's speach.

 

It is "hard evidence" that he was there at the same place as a neo nazi. It was an anti illegal immigration rally. They were there at the same time. He applauded during a speach. Obama has applauded Rev. Wright's racist sermons. Therefore Obama MUST be a racist. Obama has ties to Bill Ayers, therefore Obama MUST be a terrorist. All of the above fit the exact same bill of your proof, so if one just HAS to be true, I guess all three of them are true. It's good to know that you think Obama is a racist terrorist.

And by the way, I'd really re-think my stance if the only place I could find my "hard evidence" was a BLOG called "FEATHERED BASTARD." Where is the rest of the media on this MAJOR story?

and YOUR opinion and the op-ed pieces you cite aren't evidence either. The fact is...YOU and the left wing shit bags who are playing the race card here are LOSING. So what do you do when 70% of the public SUPPORTS the AZ law? You play the race card and try to connect the law to the Nazis.....your shit is old, lame and quite frankly, tiring.
