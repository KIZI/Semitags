Question is in the thread title....

For me, the answer would be yes.

From Conservative to Lib Dems. One of the main reasons being clegg's ability to state specifically where money is to be cut and how.

Let the debate begin.......

That happened for my boyfriend too I think. I'm still rooting for cleggsy boy.

EDIT: I'm not sure what his reasoning was though
 
 
Cameron best there simple as. Brown has shown us what he's like as leader and failed and nick clegg? WTF was he doing kept repeating the honesty crap shut up and show some substance policies.
 
 
I thought Cameron and Clegg came off well, but Gordon Brown just appeared too smug and snidy in my opinion.

Will it change how i vote? Probably not, but i suppose its given me some food for thought.
 
 
Brown owned Cameron.
 
 
I was going to vote Tories and I still am.

Brown attacked Cameron, notice Cameron didn't attack Brown to the same extent. It was a Labour tactic to try to switch votes to the Lib Dems from Tories in the hope of a coalition.
 
 
No, Cleggy before, Cleggy after!!

Brown was suprisingly good though   and Cameron was unsuprisingly awful!

And people - if you liked Cleggy the most VOTE FOR THE LIB DEMS Cable came out on top on the Chancellor debates too -- the LibDems are NOT a wasted vote, they have a real chance now!

Exactly the same as me and for the same key reason. I also shifted from Conservative to Lib Dem. I was initially in support of Conservative as they appeared to be the only party capable of putting in austerity measures needed to tackle deficit/debt.

However, after watching the debate, It seemed Lib Dem seem to have an equally realistic view of the strains on public finance and unlike the other 2 parties have actually outlined clear and exact figures for where they want to take money from and where they want to put it into. I'm for tax credits being taken away from the top 20% of recipients and also personal allowance being raised to Â£10,000 (ironically the latter was brought up by Cameron instead of Clegg). Although Clegg kind of butchered this particular phrase, I have to admit he did live up to his claim of being "straight with us" in that debate.

I know Lib Dem aren't going to get a huge number of seats, but the fact that Brown was so frantically trying to prove Clegg was in agreement with him (Essentially consisting of Brown: "Nick agrees with me"; Clegg: "No I don't." ) reminded me that the other real possibility to a Tory government is a Lib-Lab coalition, which would be decent I guess.
 
 
I'm a swing voter, between Lib Dem and Labour in a swing Lib/Lab constituency. I thought Nick Clegg was great tonight, and Gordon Brown was poor. It hasn't made my decision any easier though, as I would be voting Labour to try and assure the seat to keep out the Tories. Cameron came across like a massive ****, so I'm in the same predicament.
 
 
Gordy was better than I though, but Clegg came off the best IMO! Cameron was just just a huge ball of substance, and it just put me off the Tories even more!
 
 
I thought Cameron did brilliantly.
Though Clegg was slightly repetitive of the old politics, I did quite like his "sorry Gordon but we don't agree. What are you talking about" reaction with Brown trying to reassure us they do agree.
 
 
I thought Cameron did well. Very assertive and a good speaker. Clegg just kept repeating himself: "Its all very well to say those things... Its all very well to say those things..." I also think he was a little too optimistic in suggesting we rid ourselves of our nuclear deterrent - its not really the time to give it up when we're currently fighting a controversial (and illegal) war. But I tend to think the Lib Dems are a little too optimistic and idealistic regarding anything. Also, the NI tax rise is going to be a problem and job loss has to be a result as it'll be more expensive for employers to hire people, surely?
 
 
I was contemplating the Pirate Party over the Conservatives. I'm still pretty undecided.
 
 
Clegg = Tank
 
 
Brown did better than I thought, but his attempts at humour were just painful. As was Cameron in general.
 
 
Cameron was *****.

Clegg really has very little to lose though. He was basically ignored by the other two so really has got to be agressive to try and get a rise out of them.

I found it funny as well that he tried to mention "hope" and "change" as little as possible despite the fact a lot of his big picture stuff is recycling Obama's message. Not that that's necessarily a bad thing.

I didn't think Cameron was that bad if I'm honest. Certainly didn't come across as quite the phony some had suggested he might, though I disagree with a lot of his policies. Who the **** does his make-up btw? Peter Mandelson?
 
 
Gordon Brown didn't do too badly, ironically (ironic since I'm voting conservative) I thought Cameron came out as worst. I think Clegg was certainly the clear winner of the night though - he had a certain appeal about him that the other two didn't and didn't evade the questions.
 
 
It confirmed my vote for the Lib Dems

He had little to lose, but he also managed to gain a lot tonight. I've never really seen him as much of a leader, just another lib dem bod that they found because there was no-one else to fill the spot. I'm a Lib Dem supporter, and my opinion of him really changed tonight.

I think Cameron was doing that moreso than Clegg, really.
 
 
No, I'm still voting Labour. Brown impressed me tonight.
 
 
Boosted my confidence in voting for Brown. We need a strong, experienced leader who will lead the country in the right direction.

I am surprised at how poorly Cameron did.

Me too  
 
 
The Cleggster rocked fp
 
 
nope, and I am not going to vote because
a) I can't yet
b) I just don't like any of them.
EDIT: I was also actually shocked about Cameron's performance, it wasn't as I expected it to be
Oh and I sort of remember meeting that Jewish boy who asked the education question before. He was on Question Time too.
 
 
It's a tough decision to make; especially after that debate, it will be hard to separate the politicians from the policies. Beforehand, I had looked into policies, and had an idea about which I favoured. Watching that debate is making me think twice- whilst policies are important, it is arguably just as important to elect a PM who is right for the job, in the ways they speak and act.

Policies aside, I thought:
Brown was very weak. He seemed as if he didn't really care, and whilst he seems ambitious and as if his heart is in the right place, he just does not command the respect a leader should. He came across as uncharacteristically smug at times, but generally, as if he's given up. There was nothing particularly memorable about his debating, and his attempts at humour were painful and suggested a possible sense of insecurity.

Cameron seemed very nervous at first, but picked things up as the debate progressed. He didn't stand out as particularly charismatic and he didn't come across as as strong as I originally expected he would. I didn't like the way he'd start every answer with 'that's a wonderful question and it's important it is addressed' and whilst I'm aware the other candidates also did this, it lacked a down to earth feel, which I think voters would have a lot of respect for.

Clegg, I believe, came across best in the debate. He was up front, and seemed to present a very black and white view of politics, which I believe we need, as opposed to ambiguous policies delivered by overly-wordy politicians. However, his body language didn't impress me; he had a somewhat arrogant air about him, his hands were often in his pockets and although, admittedly, it's not the most important thing about a candidate, it's not what you really want to see from a guy who could possibly end up in charge of the country. However, in the past I've been put off by the way Clegg appears to react to questions as if he's just been asked something really stupid- that may not necessarily be what he's really thinking, but it doesn't create the best impression.

I think Clegg will get a very positive response from that debate, and a lot of this will be due to the fact that Brown and Cameron spent most of it knocking each other's policies, bringing in the occasional 'Nick agrees with me here,' only for Clegg to respond very simply 'no I don't.' Whilst Brown and Cameron may have felt using the Lib Dems' arguments to support their own, as well as to sway voters away from the 'more threatening' opposition, seemed to backfire a lot. Nick will come out of this looking like the golden boy.

I didn't realise how difficult this would be until I actually watched the debate. In terms of policies, none of them are perfect- they all said things I agree with, and some I disagree with. And of course, they aren't exactly going to tell the voters what they don't want to hear in terms of the negative repercussions their policies may potentially have. Now I've got to decide whether it's more important to vote for people or to vote for policies, and it's often hard to separate the two.

Best of luck to all first time voters in making your decisions  

Ps, did anyone else secretly giggle when Cameron said 'do do'  
 
 
It changed my opinion from Cameron to Clegg.

He was the best. Pure an simple.
 
 
To be honest I think people are being a bit harsh on Gordon, he wasn't THAT bad although he lacked style unfortunately - frankly I think there has been a lot of prejudice on Labours behalf prior to the primeministerial debates and that has influenced some opinions here too (although I may be wrong   please don't attack me for expressing my theory). Ultimately, I really do think Nick Clegg did it for me   GO NICK!!!!
 
 
Also, I know looks aren't the most important thing about a candidate, but I also believe they are very important in politics.

a) I'm surprised Clegg and Brown wore blue shirts- seems petty, but wearing Tory colours seemed like a strange choice.
b) Brown's tie was too pink- wasn't the strong red that's usually associated with the labour party.
c) Cameron's makeup was awful. Just no.
 
 
Brown was better than Cameron, but not Clegg.

The BBC/ITV polls which put Cameron in second place made me wonder if anyone else was watching the same debate as me. Cameron decided to use anecdotes instead of policy.
 
 
It made me want to change my mind from voting for Labour to voting for the Liberal Democrats.

I disagree, Cameron mentioned them large businesses, but its these kind of large businesses that thought introducin the minimum wage would cost jobs, that increases in NI before would cost jobs and it didnt, some of them are on 7 or 6 figure salaries and yet they go on about 'oh we cant employ more people if NI increases'
I think they just want to keep more profits for themselves.
Its a shame Brown didnt remind Cameron that he has backing from over 70 top economists from places like Oxbridge.

I hope a lot of people do this.

A loooooot of people. Cameron is hollow like a kinder egg without any fun toy inside.

'i met a nurse once'
'i met a handicapped child with no arms or legs once'
 

Confirmed my support of the lib dems...i really hope they do well!

I was going to pick labour despite wanting lib dems purely because lib dems wouldn't do well enough in my constituency for my vote to make a difference. After that performance I'm hoping lib dems will go up in the polls and I'll be able to vote for them with confidence that they could mount a challenge.

Exactly it was story after story, and it wasn't even my bedtime  
 
 
I think everyone can agree with Brown lost the debate, and quite badly. Though I don't think anyone expected him to do well since he's a bad orator, has failed in terms of policy in the last 13 years, and is pretty poor even in PMQs each and every time.

I felt Cameron won because he spoke well, didn't needlessly attack, and if anything showed he was a leader who rose above the baseless attacking that both Brown and Clegg took part in.

Though, that said, Clegg did well, and better than I'd expected. Though this is partly because he didn't have anything to lose and so tried a variety of approaches. (From change in politics, to anger, to exasperation.) By the way, why the heck were the Lib Dems even on the debate? They're not in government and are not the official opposition. Yes, they're the third largest party, but why not then include the 4th and 5th largest parties?

Agreed about Clegg as a leader. It's just hard not to see voting for him as throwing a vote away against the Tories really.

I think Cameron realizes that his budget 'tough realism' image really isn't all that compatible with his earlier rhetoric. His whole 'big society' thing is total ******** though.

I'll almost certainly vote Sinn Fein anyway for better or worse...  
 
 
Happened to me I think. I was originally torn between Labour & Liberal Democrats, but it is clear that Nick Clegg is severely under-rated, and his party. I'm certain I will be voting Liberal for this election! Cameron just avoided answering questions directly, such as the police funding.

I'm trying not to be too swayed by 'style over substance' as the journos call it, but it's difficult to really know the facts - I don't know what the real situation is like re adequate vehicles in Afghanistan, the finer details of immigration etc - I can only choose between what the politicians say or what the media tells us. But for me, Brown did better than I thought but I'm most swayed towards Clegg. The less said about Cameron the better, never liked him anyway though.

Just a li'l bit.
 
 
It changed my vote from Tory to Libdem. Cleggers came out strong tonight, especially with Brownie relying on him quite a bit by agreeing with him....

PLUS, he looked the most calm and confident out of the 3 of them and his goals are more realistic and achieveable than the other 2 more extreme views  

GOOD OL' CLEGGERS  
 
 
lib dems. Clegg did really well and I have been a fan of Vince Cable for a while. Brown was a bit billigerant at times but I do think that he was a lot more sincere than Cameron.
 
 
Still lib dems  
 
 
Well I'm glad Clegg came off well - coz thats fewer votes for Tories.
Ive been a libdem/labour for a while and lib is becoming more appealing because I feel more will vote for him so it wont be a wasted vote.

This is one television debate out of three.

Behind the television performance and the make-up are genuine policies.

Changing your vote based upon this is short-sighted to say the very least.

Will it change how i vote? Probably not, but i suppose its given me some food for thought.

 

Pa hah my dad was like 'stop smiling knob!'...... 'i wanna get up there and wipe the smile off the smug dickheads face!'
thought i'd share that as it amused me greatly  

And to the question, i think clegg came across calm n collected. But it was like stfu with all his 'i'm honest and open crap'

But as yet i'm still undecided bout who to vote for
 
 
Will be interesting to see how, if at all, this affects the next round of opinion polls.
 
 
Lib Dem for me   He actually stated how he was going to apply the policies in reference to taking money from one place to fund another thing. He came of very well I think. It also helped him that Brown and Cameron just bitched about each others' policies.
 
 
I didnt think Brown did that badly, but im still voting for the libdems, just hope other people will too and stop seeing it as a "wasted vote"!

Yes, yes I did.

I also found it quite funny how Cameron said "I was talking to a 40 year old black man the other day, who came over here when he was 6 and served in the navy for 30 years..." wow, the navy are recruiting 10 year olds now then... Something tells me that this particular meeting didn't really happen...
 
 
Lib Dem!
David Cameron has a horrible mouth...
 
 
conservatives to lib dems...
 
 
I don't know a thing about politics, but today I decided to do some research and then watch the debate. Clegg won it for me
 
 
If i could vote (i'm still only 17) i'd be Lib Dem, i swear if all the people who thought Lib Dems was a wasted voted just voted for them they'd win ALOT more seats. But basically i just like the whole proportional representation, lowering the voting age, stopping the conservatives ripping up our highstreet (they claim to be fixing it   )... any luck Orpington might not be conservative for the billionth time in a row!
  x
 
 
Was going to vote Tory, now L.D.
 
 
Yes, was a Labour supporter but Nick Clegg has caused me to rethink.
 
 
I just really don;t want conservatives, so will see where the majoritys going between lab/lib dems and vote for that so conservatives don't get in  
 
 
Brown seemed to spend most of the time saying "I think Nick agrees with me on this one" or having little digs at Cameron. My vote is going to Lib Dems
 
 
I would certainly be voting for Lib Dems if I could and even more so after this debate. It upsets me that I have to sit back during this general election and let everybody else decide what will happen. Please vote Lib Dems because do we really want to carry on under the policies of Labour which so far have got us nowhere, or the lies of Mr Cameron who as far as I am concerned does not have a clue about what he is doing!
 
 
I am sorry, but so many people are changing their minds, based on one stinking debate! wait for the other two?
plus nick clegg had nothing to lose, so obvs he performed better. All he had to say was look, lab/ con didnt get you anywhere, so plz vote for us.
personally tho, i support lib dems, but as long as conservatives dont win, i am happy
