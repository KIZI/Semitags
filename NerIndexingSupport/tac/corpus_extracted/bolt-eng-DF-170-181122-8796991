Thanks for the update.
 
 
 Plane crashes into house in suburban Buffalo - CNN.com 
 
 
dang
2 not on the plane, taken to the hospital
 
 
There was absolutely no communication from the plane that there was any problems whatsoever. The plane did not skid off of a runway. So I wonder what happened?
 
 
I heard that they are speculating that it had engine trouble. It was a prop plane? Turbo engines?
 
 
Prop.

Dash 8. Q400. Plane was on fire in the air. Terrorism?

fuck I hope not. When you texted us on here about the plane landing in the water a few weeks ago, I got a chill. starting to get one again now.
 
 
I doubt it was terrorisim because they don't mess with the little planes and even if it was the public would never it if it was. (Flight 800)

i would give it time for the data to be collected before making that leap

Are you serious? Do you have any idea what it would do to our economy and airliners if this plane was shot down by terrorists? People would freak out. Nothing you could do to protect yourself against a stinger missile.

do not jump to conclution you dont have facts to back up

and yes there are things you can do to protect a plane from a stinger

Yeah but make no error, the officials will never say it was, so people wouldn't panic like you think. That is exactly why Flt 800 was covered up. I still think like DiveCon said it is way to early to tell. It was a prop plane, if it was on it's approach all kinds of things could have happened, wind shear or birds. Lets wait and see if any little tid bits come out.
 
 
News just stated that a witness reported seeing an engine on fire. That isn't a terrorist act.

exactly
we dont KNOW what happened yet

i would be skeptical of that as well
the Pilots would more than likely have reported an engine on fire
 
 
all 48 dead.
 
 
 
all 48 dead.

 

and i think they said one of the 2 on the ground(taken to hospital) has died
 
 
yeah and officials wouldn't talk about any pilot communications either. They usually keep this tight lipped until they find the black boxes.
 
 
 
 
all 48 dead.

 

and i think they said one of the 2 on the ground(taken to hospital) has died

 

at least one on ground. fuck.
 
 
Fox News has someone live on the ground there they will be talking to
when they come back from commercial break
 
 
I cannot even imagine being one of those passengers because you know you have at least a minute or more before you crash. You know it's coming!

*says a prayer*

I have foxnews on now. Showing Fire trucks. How many houses got damaged besides the the plane crashed in?

they dont have a live video feed though
 
 
oops, maybe they do now
 
 
Jet fuel, they are letting it burn off cause it's still burning?
 
 
Whatever caused this... we must pray the souls of the deceased and their families. If this was mechanical, hopefully we can find out the cause of this and it will save lives like Delta Flight 191. Because of Delta Flight 191, pilots are now trained on how to go through microbursts and have on board forward radar to allow pilots to detect microbursts. This has saved many, many lives.
 
 
Airport was reporting wind gust of up to 25 mph but no flight delays because of it.
 
 
mechanical problems reported before reaching Buffalo area?

I've been watching MSNBC - their coverage has been excellent since they had an aviation expert, Bob Hagger, on. FoxNews was just awful with the coverage. They landed 3-4 miles short of the runway... light snow, moderate winds, nothing really too bad. No delays at the airport.

No just the 13th because it's bad for me! Seriously it is. I had someone break into my car, and start it on fire because I wouldn't go with this guy to his house.

My purse was stolen, I lost my entire paycheck

And a serious attack I will not discuss here!

NBC coverage has been excellent. Singing off for now.
 
 
There was absolutely NO indication of a problem. MSNBC played the tower recordings - tower said they lost communications and the plane simply dropped off of the radar screen. No mayday, no distress call.

I do not feel comfortable with the security on puddle jumpers. It seems it is too easy to get to the cockpit. Just the feeling I get and it's too soon to even think about it.

There is, so far, absolutely no evidence to suggest this was anything but an accident, either.

It is being reported that recently at least one airline grounded their fleet of those planes entirely because of mechanical problems.
 
 
They're saying one of the people on board was the widow of a 9/11 victim. she was on her way to buffalo to celebrate what would have been his 58th birthday.

very sad.

Ugh. That's really, really, really bad.
 
 
well, it's certainly stomach turning.

I wonder if they had kids. The news said something about a scholarship fund having been set up in her husband's name.
 
 
 Sept. 11 widow killed in Buffalo plane crash 
 
 
my family got freaked out over this because, I was on a Continental flight on my way to Newark as this place crashed.

very sad for the people on board...My flight in that day was pretty scary...never had such a rough landing when we went though those winds Thursday night.
