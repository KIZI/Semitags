Stanley Cup hero Milan Lucic was questioned by police early yesterday after he and his girlfriend got into an altercation in the North End.

According to a police report of the incident, the Bruins [team stats] left winger was “highly intoxicated and hostile” after he and his galpal argued outside a Starbucks on Commercial Street shortly before 1:30 a.m.

 

 

Yeah, I heard all about it.

Young couple get into argument in public.

Meh.

Too bad he had to use one of the douchier phrases in existence during the drama.

 
As the officer continued to question Lucic, he “slammed his cell phone to the ground and yelled ‘Do you know who I am?’ ” the police report states. At which point, the officer asked for identification and Lucic produced an ID from Vancouver, Canada.

 

Douche.
 
 
Yeah I immediately thought of kennedys old "Do you know who I am" line.

Thats just a fail in the public eye no matter who is saying it, and I'm a lucic fan but that was a bit low to say IMO.

He's a douche but I tend to give him a pass because he's our douche.

But still, he kinda sucked last year. Dude needs to zip it up and rediscover his game this season.

I think he broke his hand because he looked completely afraid to fight or get real physical like he had in the previous season.
 
 
Just read some sad news... Sorry if it's in the wrong place but I'm rushing...

 
Russian officials say that 43 of 45 people on a Russian jet died today when the plane carrying the Lokomotiv Yaroslavl hockey team crashed just after takeoff near the city of Yaroslavl.

Those who perished include former NHL All-Star Pavol Demitra, according to his agent.

The Kontinental Hockey League said on its website that others on board included newly-appointed Lkomotiv coach and former NHL defenseman Brad McKrimmon.

Two members of the 2010 World Championship Czech team, Jan Marek and Josef Vasicek, were also among those in the crash, according the KHL.

Matt Keator, the agent for Demitra, told USA TODAY that he has learned that Demitra died. The ex-St. Louis Blues standout was beginning his second season with the Russian team.

First and foremost, our condolences go out to the families and friends of the players, coaches and staff lost in todays tragedy.

I'm from the Orr and Esposito days. Poetry in motion. I still love Phil and I don't give a shit when those would always call him "mr. garbage man".

He knew how to work the front in the net better honestly for true here guys I swear Phil just knew how the puck would hit those back boards and Bobby would be able to free the puck and freaking kick it loose and then Phil would hook it and bring it home.

They do. But it seems like they collapse really fast once they can string together a good run. If I remember right last season they skidded (skud?) hard right before the end.
 
 
I'm a Sabres fan, but the best team I've seen at this point is Tampa Bay. They held the Flyers to 15 shots including overtime Wedneday. Looks like Stevie Y has them on the right track.

Miller has a concussion and is out indefinitely. Does that make you happy PLYMCO_PILGRIM? It is his second concussion in 8 months, so there is always the concern he will have long term problems.

Lucic has a hearing today with the league. He should be suspended. In or out of the crease, goaltenders are not fair game.

No I'm not happy about the concussion thats not cool even though miller is a bitch.

Lucic won't be suspended, coming out that far and getting in lucic's line of skating that agressively is why lucic wont be suspended....if he was just standing out of the crease and not agressively skating toward lucic and lucic did that then yes lucic would be in trouble, but he wont be.

Just watched it again....Lucic shouldn't be suspended and shouldn't have put his arms out to protect himself from the goalie's agressive poke check.

We'll see. Lucic made no effort to avoid the hit, he was aggressive. His comments after the game are self incriminating.

"Definitely," Lucic said when asked if the response would have been different if Thomas had been hit like that. "We wouldn't accept anything like that. We would have taken care of business, but we're a different team than they are."

 NHL Rule 69  regarding Interference on the Goalkeeper states:

"In all cases in which an attacking player initiates intentional or deliberate contact with a goalkeeper, whether or not the goalkeeper is inside or outside the goal crease, and whether or not a goal is scored, the attacking player will receive a penalty."

Furthermore, the rule says about contact outside the goal crease:

"A goalkeeper is not fair game just because he is outside the goal crease. The appropriate penalty should be assessed in every case where an attacking player makes unnecessary contact with the goalkeeper. However, incidental contact will be permitted when the goalkeeper is in the act of playing the puck outside his goal crease provided the attacking player has made a reasonable effort to avoid such unnecessary contact."

Lucic said after the game, "I was going full speed so it was pretty hard for me to put on the brakes."

Still, there does not seem to be a reasonable effort made by Lucic to avoid the incidental contact.

It is against NHL rules to check the goaltender.
 
 
We will see, like I was saying he shouldn't have put his arms out like that. If he didn't it would be a definate ok play for lucic.

The arms out may get him in trouble, i'm pretty confident he wont get into any but its all about the arms thing....there was no way lucic was going to avoid running into him so he does have that going for him.

Brendan Shanahan has been tough....

 Shanahan  succeeded Colin Campbell as the NHL's chief player disciplinarian. In his very first preseason as director of player discipline, Shanahan delivered multiple suspensions to players for illegal hits, each suspension accompanied by an explaining video. Shanahan's unforgiving enforcement of the rules has gained support league-wide, earning him the nicknames "Sheriff Shanny" and "Shanaban". Players on the receiving end of his suspensions are also said to have been slammed by the "Shanahammer".
 
 
That is true he has been very tough this year so maybe I am wrong...i hope not  

And, even though I hate Miller (because he is good and not on my team), I hope he can come back to play before the end of the week.

 Milan Lucic's success built on controlled aggression - ESPN Boston 

 
Miller and the Sabres were not happy with the incident that landed Lucic in the box with a minor penalty for charging. Afterward, Lucic claimed he had his head down in pursuit of the puck, and when he looked up at the last second, Miller, who was in the faceoff circle to his right trying to play the puck, was right in front of him.

Miller remained in the game for the rest of the first period and the entire second period before he was replaced by backup Jhonas Enroth to start the third. Following the game Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff said Miller had a sore neck, and later the team deemed it a concussion.

The NHL held a disciplinary hearing Monday and ruled that Lucic was not at fault and would not be suspended or fined for the play. It was the right decision by Brendan Shanahan, the senior vice president of player safety and hockey operations.

Miller and the Sabres likely will disagree with the league's decision, but Lucic was only hustling and trying to create a scoring chance. If he did not play with that controlled style of reckless abandon, Lucic would not be a successful player. If he did not play that way, he would not have been able to help the Bruins hoist the Stanley Cup last spring.

That being said you are right, if someone hit thomas like that the bruins would have at least retaliated and us boston fans would be calling for a suspension....we would be wrong in doing so but we would still want it.

MORE horseshit. Brendan Shanahan was wrong, he blew it. The NHL is an absolute JOKE, as usual. Shanahan said he wanted to ask Lucic questions about his 'intent'...gee, were they multiple choice questions Brendan? WTF do you expect Lucic to say: 'yea, I did it on purpose'

Hey Brendan, I didn't mean to take out that guys eye with my stick, it was unintentional high sticking...Oh, OK...no suspension.

Hey officer, I didn't mean to run over that kid with my car, it was unintentional...Oh, OK...no charges.

I don't who this goof ball homer Joe McDonald is, but people with more credibility don't agree...

 Kerry Fraser says Milan Lucic deserved two-game suspension 

 

Brendan Shanahan was quick to condemn the Buffalo Sabres comments that goalies are becoming fair game after Milan Lucic wasnt suspended for his check on Ryan Miller, but one retired official thinks that Lindy Ruffs complaints are spot-on. Kerry Fraser claimed that Lucic deserved a two-game suspension in his TSN column:

I believe [Shanahan] really missed this call and has sent the wrong message. Like it or not, goalies enjoy preferred treatment similar to endangered species in the wild; at least up until this latest decision. It would now appear they are subjected to the same rules as any other player once they leave the protection of their nest! Lindy Ruff has every right to call foul on this non suspension. Milan Lucic should have been suspended for the next two (2) games.

Fraser goes on to explain that he attended a meeting with GMs and coaches in which it was generally agreed that goalies would be untouchable. Fraser also believed that the two-minute charging penalty should have been a major instead, so he disagreed with the on-ice officials as well as Shanahans ruling.

Long story short, theres at least one (former) official who claims that goalies arent fair game, even if theyre outside the crease.

 Leaf's coach Ron Wilson: NHL needs 'to find a way to protect' its goalies 

 Canucks notes: 'Lucic could have avoided it' 
 
The Big Question: Is it officially open season on goalies? 

BTW...

 Matt Cooke's Hit On Marc Savard Goes Unpunished By Boston Bruins 

How can you not retaliate after your star offensive player, Marc Savard, was clocked by the notorious Matt Cooke?

Cooke, who is a player who has been suspended a multitude of times for cheat shots.

This isnt your Daddys Big Bad Bruins.

If this happened in the days of Terry OReilly or even Lyndon Byers, Cooke would be holding his teeth in his hand.

Paging Milan Lucic.

Paging Shawn Thornton.

Paging Steve Begin.

Paging Claude Julien.

Why didnt the Bruins coach send one of his enforcers to avenge the hit on one of their team leaders?

Just like in our politics discussions you're getting overly dramatic because you disagree  

 

Overly dramatic? Do you honestly believe Lucic would admit any intent? If intent was the issue, why not ask other players who were on the ice that night? Maybe he should have asked Sabre's defenseman Robyn Regehr: "That was part of their game plan, they had a couple other incidents when they were in there near the crease"

Was Kerry Frazer overly dramatic? Was Ron Wilson Overly dramatic? Were the Canuck players Overly dramatic?

Is Canucks winger Alex Burrows overly dramatic?

Im really surprised and even more confused, Canucks winger Alex Burrows said after the ruling. Ive been trying to figure it out and I dont know if goalies are in play now if theyre out of their crease. This might set a precedent. Shanahan played the game and he probably knew that he [Lucic] had time to move and growing up you learn you cant really hit the goalies. I would have dove at the puck or have tried to get out of the way.

I thought there would be repercussions. Were concerned. I thought we were trying to get those kind of hits out of this league and now it might be back to old-time hockey. The next thing you know, you might have a line brawl or a bench clearing.

 The Hit Heard 'Round The Crease 

Lucic deliberately ran over Miller, and it's surprising Shanahan saw it so differently. That Lucic then essentially taunted the Sabres, saying the Bruins would never stand for such an insult to their goalie, will help produce fireworks next week that NHL.com will gleefully both promote and then feature on its website.

But in it's "war" against concussions, the league seems to have excluded goalies from the endangered list. Right now, given the Reimer and Miller incidents/injuries, you'd have to argue there's evidence that taking a run at the other guy's goalie is more than worth it.

I guess Ryan Miller is being over dramatic. Or maybe it's the Boston doctors who diagnosed that he suffered a concussion.
 
 
No, not Ryan Miller being overly dramatic as he's stating his case. You're stating his case as if it is the only case.

It's not.  
 
 
Well miller is a drama queen but that isn't what I was saying.

I was saying you were going overboard (overdramatic) in your response and getting way to fired up about it for me.

Lucic's hit on Ryan Miller IS the topic PLYMCO_PILGRIM and I were discussing.
 
 
 
Well miller is a drama queen but that isn't what I was saying.

I was saying you were going overboard (overdramatic) in your response and getting way to fired up about it for me.

 

It has nothing to do with you. Get over yourself.

I have been following the NHL since the 1960's. I played and coached the sport. I have USA Hockey coaching accreditation.

Hockey is a great sport, it's the fastest team sport on the planet. But the NHL has always been a Mickey Mouse run organization. I watched as Fred Shero and the Broad Street Bullies turned the NHL into Slap Shot and the Hansen brothers...the league did NOTHING. It took the great Montreal Canadien teams of Scotty Bowman to dispatch that goon style of play. I watched the league award the Stanley Cup on Sabre's ice to the Dallas Stars when Brent Hull was given credit for NO GOAL...the league did NOTHING.

The NHL rarely gets it right. Lucic ran through Miller. There was not even a hint Lucic tried to hold up. And for Shanahan to explain his decision based on 'intent' is ludicrous. NO player is going to self incriminate himself. It is childish to believe otherwise.

You are being blinded by partisanship.

Yes, but you are detaching it as if it stands alone. Litigation will see if that's the case and until then, it's just opinions.

You have yours which has been validated as a valid opinion. Now you are attempting to show it as the only right one and that's where your anxiety and drama comes up.

In defense of you, not the opinions.

I already told you if it happened to Thomas bruins fans would be calling for the same treatment you are and I also said they would be wrong.

Like I said from the beginning I didn't think it was a dirty hit, you did, hence our real dissagreement.

I didn't say it was a dirty hit. It is an illegal hit. It is against the rules to hit a goaltender, in or out of the crease. If Lucic hit a defenseman, that would be a legal hit.

All laws and rules are built on precedent. The steamroll hit Lucic laid on Miller set the precedent...it is merely a 2 minute minor...THAT is what Shanahan and the league are saying. And THAT is unacceptable.

Leaf's coach Ron Wilson: "However, a goaltender's more or less defenceless in some of those situations. They're not wearing the same type of equipment, they're not built to absorb a 250-pound freight train running you over. Whereas a defenceman may. That's the debate that's going to go on in the next couple of days. Should we be protecting goaltenders?"

The league has opened up a can of worms. Shanahan blew it. I agree with what Ron Wilson and Kerry Frazer said.

I suggest you think about it. Without Thomas, the Cup would be somewhere else, and the rest of the league knows it. If Thomas were taken out like Miller in the playoffs, Boston fans would still be reminiscing about Bobby Orr scoring the winning goal flying through the air, his arms raised in victory  as his shot got by goaltender Glenn Hall.
 
 
Gotta love Thomas

League General Managers send Shanahan a message...you were WRONG, Lucic should have been suspended.

 TORONTO  - The next player to hammer a goaltender outside of his crease isn't likely to get off as easily as Milan Lucic.

A discussion among the league's 30 general managers Tuesday produced a strong consensus that goalies need to be better protected - even when they stray from their own goal to play the puck. That's exactly what Buffalo's Ryan Miller was doing on Saturday night when he suffered a concussion after taking a hit from Lucic.

After learning Tuesday that roughly two-thirds of GMs would have preferred to see a suspension in the case, Shanahan acknowledged that his mandate had been altered.

"I think there's certainly a very heightened sensitivity to the goalies and the future of all the goalies in this league," he said. "Certainly they're not fair game. I think that players have to understand that. The general managers expressed to me the importance of all the players on the ice but also the extreme importance of the goaltender in that position.

"So I do think that's something as a message to the players around the league, if anybody does think that it's a tactic and a tactic that is a smart gamble on their part, it won't be."

Let them play. Great play Lucic lighting up a goalie who went to far out of his area but never the less, there was no intent to hurt..a collision happen and lucic was bracing for it otherwise miller would have wound up in the glass. Flashback on Van Ryan.

I would go with a 2 minute minor and that's about it...Goalies should keep their butts where they belong, in goal making saves.

My guess is Ryan Miller is more pissed at his team mates for not kicking Lucic's ass.

Let the players handle this melodrama...

Probie's brain says he was absorbin'em.

 
A study shows the late Bob Probert, at left, had a
degenerative brain condition when he died at 45.

 Researchers: Bob Probert had CTE 

Bob Probert knew the fierce pounding he dished out and received over 16 seasons as an NHL enforcer was taking its toll as he got older. That's why he wanted his brain to be analyzed once he died.

Even though heart failure ultimately ended his life last July at age 45, Probert also was living with a damaged brain.

Researchers at Boston University said Thursday that Probert had the degenerative brain disease Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy.

Trio of hockey enforcer deaths no coincidence  Laraque

Former Oiler says there are constant worries for players who make a living fighting in NHL

 
Colourful tough guy Wade Belak was found dead on Wednesday in Toronto from an apparent suicide.

EDMONTON - In the wake of Wade Belaks suicide, retired heavyweight Georges Laraque doesnt think its happenstance that three NHL players who made their living as fighters have shockingly died over the summer.

A coincidence? No, said the former Edmonton Oilers tough guy, who now is host of a sportstalk show in Montreal modelled after TSNs Off The Record.

Laraque has been bowled over by the deaths of Derek Boogaard, Rick Rypien and now Wade Belak in the last few months.

This job is so hard, physically and mentally, said Laraque. You can go to a movie theatre the night before a game, and youre thinking of the fight youre going to get into the next day. Like, you have to fight Boogaard. Then that games over and its like OK, I have to fight Jody Shelley. After that its Brian McGrattan. You try not to think about it, but you start with the drugs or the alcohol and that creates the problem.

Like I said, if you are worried about it do NOT be an enforcer. If you can't be on a team without being an enforcer than maybe your skill level isn't high enough to play in the NHL.

Mark Rypien wasn't a fighter.

Probie was the best during his time but it didn't help with his off ice activities and being arrested for what?....when probie left the wings, management made negative comments in that regard
 
 
Lucic's first shift buffalo sends out their "fighter".....Lucic still has the skills  
 
 
 
Lucic's first shift buffalo sends out their "fighter".....Lucic still has the skills  

 

It was a good hockey game for fans who understand the sport. Buffalo had the better scoring chances, but they only count when the red light goes on. Thomas was stellar in the shootout. But both net-minders played great.

Pound for pound, the toughest player on the ice was the smallest in stature and biggest in heart and grit...

Nathan Gerbe...At 5'5" in height, Gerbe is the shortest player in the NHL.

 
Watch out, or the little guy will light you up.

In a crucial game during the stretch run of the 2010-2011 season, the Sabres were doggedly trying to hold onto a slim 1-0 lead against the Montreal Canadiens. With under thirty seconds left, the Canadiens had an extra attacker and were applying massive pressure in the Sabres zone. A scrappy Gerbe was badgering opponents and finally knocked the puck loose whereupon he recovered it and scored an empty net goal.

Side note: I made a +/- 20 goals bet for Marchand with a buddy at work at the start of the season. For every goal over 20 I get five bucks.

Sitting pretty right now.
 
 
 
 
 
Getting a little tick off on the sharks last 10 games, 3-5-2. Wilson made the trades but some how the players and coache(s) haven't figure out a winning strategy. Jumbo needs to produce more..shoot the puck and quit being so perfect.

 

Trade Thornton for a bag of pucks and start over.

Worked for us.

 

Remind me not to ask your opinion.
Yeah will see at game 82.......in the meantime50+ to play.

 

That was a joke.

But anyway........... you will never, ever win with Joe Thornton as one of you primary players.
 
 
Seven different Bruins score a goal as the smash the Calgary Flames 9-0 heading towards a Stanley Cup Finals rematch against the Canucks this Saturday.

What a pathetic team Calgary is. They lose a game 9-0 and they never tried to pick a fight.

I can only watch like 8 minutes of each game while I am getting ready for work but I listen to it on the way into town.

They are mauling teams.

Thornton's impact on the Sharks has been far greater than the results for the Bruins, the Sharks have made the playoffs every year since the trade and I'd consider them an elite team, among the top 5 in the NHL since the trade. The eventual signings of Chara and Savard worked okay but you traded off Sturm, Primeau and Stuart anyway.

Granted, the Sharks have kinda turtled in the playoffs and Bruins finally won after almost 40 years but Thornton still remains one of the best play maker's in the NHL.

Yeah, the Sharks got our deadweight "leader" and haven't won shit. The Bruins are now a completely restructured team loaded with young talent that is signed for the next few seasons as opposed to having to rely on a choke artist like Thornton to provide the bulk of the offense. Oh, and they are defending Cup Champs. Mark my words, that doesn't happen with Joe still on our team wearing a C.

The Sharks suck
Thornton sucks

The Bruins are leading the NHL in goals scored and are blowing the league out of the water in goal differential despite not having a player in the top 20 in points.

Oh, and there isn't a team in the league that can out tough them either.

Balance, we has it.

mmm. the Sharks are 4 to 0 in Boston as I recall, since the trade..

Bruins fans hate the players that have gladly left them..recall.. Ray Bourque, Bobby Orr, Phil Esposito, Kessel and lets just add Thornton to the list mmmkay.....  

Joe wanted to be traded, he had an eye injury, he had the most points on the team and Bruins management wanted that cheap shot artist Chara.

btw Thornton's from my home town... London, Ontario, Canada

We didn't want thorton to go, everyone here thought it was dumb at the time. Today, looking back in hindsight, thank god we traded him or our team wouldn't be where it is today.

We always hated kessle, he was a shitbird even if he has some skills.

As far as #77.....some picutres

He did this:
 

Boston did this:

     
 
 
I would have been happy with the Thornton trade if we actually got something back for him. What we got was a bunch of mediocre crap. That's what burned my ass about the trade, not Joe leaving per se'

I had seen him not get it done enough at that point.

 Brad Marchand Expected to Play Against Canucks, Which Is Surprisingly Welcome News to Daniel Sedin - Boston Bruins - NESN.com 

 
What may be a bit surprising is that at least one Canuck is hoping that Marchand is on the ice on Saturday.

"He's a good player for that team," Vancouver forward Daniel Sedin said after his club practiced Friday afternoon at Harvard University. "You always want to play the best players and the best teams. That's why you play hockey. It should be fun."

Last year's Final wasn't much fun for Sedin. Not only did the Canucks lose in seven games, but Sedin was punished physically and humiliated by Marchand on two memorable occasions.

 
 
 
 

That's just Sissydeen saying what he thinks is the right thing to say. For a minute there I actually thought he might have the sack to drop the gloves and make a run at Marchand.

What was I thinking.

I forgot about that Hansen hit on Ference.

I hope Andy returns the favor today.

I really want to see a whole lot of ass kicking handed out today.
 
 
Good Game so far...i missed the fights though because, as I thought would happen, work actually came in when I decided to try and watch the game

In a nutshell, the Canucks are tough guys when it's six on one. Not so much when it's one on one.

How someone can root for team that plays the way Vancouver does is beyond me. They make Montreal look like the Flyers. Vancouver knows they can't beat the Bruins 5-5 so doing everything they can to get on a powerplay makes sense. They are still by far the inferior hockey club. If we meet them again in the Finals this year it wont go seven games. More like Bruins in five.

And Lucic (pronouced LOO-chick, I don't care who the fuck says otherwise even him), getting kicked out of the game and Vancouver somehow having a 5-3 after that gang attack was one of the bigger officiating fails I've ever seen.
 
 
 
Come on Rask! wtf

 

Apologies to Rask for my outrage. Gord set me straight in the intermission. What looked like a soft goal from a bad angle live actually ricocheted twice before it found the five hole.

But whatcha gonna do?

True but Elaine basically put a hit out on Marshmont yet his guy hit him lower.

I don't even care if it's game one of the finals, next time we meet them Ralph needs to start the game with a line of Luc, Thornton, and Campbell with Chara and McQuaid in the back and when the puck drops all their gloves drop whether the 'nucks are willing participants or not.

I don't know a pucking thing about hockey. Don't like it. Never watch it. Showing it on tv is a waste of good electricity.

Good idea...I'm kinda nice but these other Guys are extreme fans, you might end up with a road apple slap shot to the head or simply tied to the goal posts for target practice..

Did anyone catch the pittsburg toronto game? WOW it was good!
 
 
'canes win...  

4 wins against Boston...

That's pwnage...lol
 
 
Just to be instigator...which is my specialty after all...  

I'm thinkin the Eastern Conference is pretty weak compared to the Western Conference..

Granted, Boston is kicking ass (a destined..SC.. team) and way dominates on the goal differential but if you consider the weakness of the eastern conference.. it's more understandable..

yuk..yuk... any comments?...

Shut up I went to BOTH cains games! My dad lives there so we have the friendly family rivalry....its FREAKING KILLING ME! lol.
 
 
Another Bruin loss today...

Couple that wit the Flyers loss and it's a glorious day...

11 of their 16 regulation losses are against non playoff teams.

The team just doesn't get up at all for those games.

It's an issue but nothing to be concerned about.

Gabbs is amazing and HEN-RIK is a friggin' wall...
 
 
Watching the bruins shut down ovechckin was fun  
 
 
It is a good game and i also like to play the Ice Hockey.It is one of my favorite game but North American teams are very good in this game.

Good lord, you're such a dick.

Football season is over, hockey takes priority now.

Timmy keeps effing up that locker room and adding unneeded distractions. I'm thanking him for his service and asking for his departure.
 
 
Yes, blame the downward spiral on Timmah...

 

Clueless....

Dude, had you been actually up to speed on the Bruins for the last several seasons you would know that they go through these funks every year. It's actually not as bad this year as it has been in recent seasons when they lose ten in a row. This is far from a "downward spiral" and I'm not "blaming" Thomas for it.

Thomas was never the most popular guy in that locker room and he's bringing in all sorts of unneeded media attention to his teammates and to Bruins brass from his own individual actions. He's not being a good teammate and with the Bruins being a team first locker room I think he needs to be moved now before he makes things worse again. That's all.

You may now continue with your patented "I'm gonna be a dick all night routine"

I'm sure if I gave a fuck about your second rate hockey team I might care about your whining...

Your team has more problems than a goalie with a mouth who doesn't dig your 0ssiah... Throw in the psycho Rask and you guys might as well grab a nun from Mount St. Mary's Academy for Girls to try and stop pucks...

Do you think the inability to score goals might also be a factor? Pay attention...

You're welcome to be a dick if you want... nothing new...

Like I said, they go thru these funks. How easily you forget they were mauling teams every night not long ago.

And Despite having trouble scoring recently they still have a considerable lead on the Rangers in both goals scored and goal differential.

Thanks for the offer to be a dick but I'm just fine keeping a cool head while you pop off. You're whistling past the graveyard, House. All this talk just might bite you in the ass later on.

sure... a funk... right...

 
And Despite having trouble scoring recently they still have a considerable lead on the Rangers in both goals scored and goal differential.

 

It's the same tired argument from "fans" who are used to seeing their teams winning... Failure turns them into raving douches... I expect nothing less from you...

 
Thanks for the offer to be a dick but I'm just fine keeping a cool head while you pop off. You're whistling past the graveyard, House. All this talk just might bite you in the ass later on.

 

It wasn't an offer, but rather an observation... You ARE a dick... It comes as no surprise from a disgruntled and dejected Cheatriots fan...

The Rangers have talent, goaltending and team cohesion going on... You can deny it, but you'll just look more of an idiot then usual... All of those players have bought into the Torts system and will continue to take that forward... That was a helluva comeback win against TB... Most teams would have thrown in the towel, but the Rangers fight to the ending second....

I'd watch out for Ottawa and Toronto if I were you...
 
 
Yeah, it's a funk and yeah you're definitely just out to be a dick.

BTW the Bruins were down 3-1 late in the second against Ottawa two weeks ago, came back and won 4-3 in regulation.

Whistling past the graveyard, you are.

 
 
 
Wow, color me unimpressed, Dick....

I see changing goalies against Buffalo made a huge difference...  
 
 
 
Wow, color me unimpressed, Dick....

 

You want to thump your chest about a gutty comeback win and tell me to watch out for Ottawa...a team the Bruins have a recent gutty comeback win over.

Keep chirping during the regular season, it shows your insecurity. We'll see what happens when it counts.

While you spend your time "Bradying", ponder the teams gunning for your faltering team during the stretch...

While you are trying to marginalize the B's and pump up Ottawa and Toronto how about pondering how many games in hand the Bruins have on each team.

While you are trying to marginalize the B's and pump up Ottawa and Toronto how about pondering how many games in hand the Bruins have on each team.

 

I'm trying to figure out how you can be happy with the recent performance of the "colors" you're recently rocking...

See ya Tuesday night, Gronktard....  
 
 
I'm not happy with the Bruins recent performance but then again my teams don't have to be riding high in order for me to rock their colors being a fan and all.

Good luck Tuesday, it should be another great game.
 
 
We've been over this...

I don't need to rock my colors on USMB to be a fan... The team will take my US dollars despite my avatar...

I hope Timmah is in goal so you don't have to whine again about Rask fucking it up...

Maybe you losers can get something by the trade deadline... That would be gronktacular...lol
 
 
I remember Gretzky saying that the regular season is just paper. Well, it's not as much as it was back then but still it is a valid response.

And 32 wins out of 53 games (2 wins in OT) and 68 points gives Boston the top of the North East.

HOME AWAY L10

17-9-2 16-8-0 4-5-1 (4 wins, one loss and one overtime point)

Not a bad record considering.

Now you're flat out making stuff up.

That goal at the end of OT wasn't on Rask and I certainly didn't complain about his play that game. I did lol at him flipping out again at the end because that shit was hilarious.

 
Maybe you losers can get something by the trade deadline... That would be gronktacular...lol

 

Maybe the defending champs do. The moves Peter made at the deadline last year panned out pretty good, I'd say.

Yeah, and Chirelli has a record of making good moves at the deadline and he has a ton of chips to play with. You're the one who brought up them possibly making a move.

Yes, the goaltending isn't great right now but up until their mid-season funk Rask and Thomas were 1-2 in league in GAA.

And the playoffs are like two months away, we're aren't exactly at the wire here, dude. You are working real hard to try and crap on the Bruins.

Both of the Bruins goalies are in the top ten in league in GAA, both are very talented, and again they were 1-2 until recently. You're really stretching here.

I'm getting a real kick out the irony regarding your Obama remark BTW considering this is all you trying to spin the Bruins, who are a damned good team, into something terrible and I'm just responding to your attacks. Bringing politics into the matter is weak, BTW.

House, five points separate the Bruins and the Rangers but I haven't been going out of my way to try to either shit on the Rangers or thump my chest about the Bruins. Why? Because they are both damn good teams and are both legit threats to win the Cup this year.

You are projecting a whole lot of insecurity, yo.
 
 
I'm just pointing out the PRESENT goaltending issues in the Boston franchise...

You can ignore it, but i can laugh at you for doing so...

Trash talking is part of sports...

Dude, I've been saying Timmy is the primary issue right now. He hasn't been playing well, isn't being a good teammate, and he's bringing unneeded drama to the locker room. Right now he's bad for that team. I haven't been ignoring their problems, I'm the guy who wants him moved. Hello? Yet when I said this earlier you claimed I was "clueless" for blaming him.

You really are all over the place...........

Where did I claim you were clueless for blaming him? I meant for ONLY blaming him... THAT is clueless... Your whole team has issues beyond the golatending... But if Timmah was a pro 0bama bot you'd be grabbing the tissues and Jergens over him...  

Lets Go Rangers!

The Bruins are prolly the deepest team in the league, House, and I've been telling you they go thru stretches like this during the season. The Bruins are notorious for ups and downs during the season yet when I told you that you said "I'm sure if I gave a fuck about your second rate hockey team I might care about your whining". You're just tossing crap around.

And you are sorely mistaken if you think I would be fine with Thomas separating himself from the team and that locker room by making such charged political statements in any ideological direction. This is just you projecting. The Bruins are all about team and right now what he's doing is anti-team.
 
 
 
If I were you, I'd be praying you don't meet Carolina in the 1st round...

 

The Bruins can't motivate themselves when they are playing bad teams, it shows in their record. They play down to the level of their competition.

Thankfully, Carolina's chances of making the playoffs are negligible.

This is just you projecting. The Bruins are all about team and right now what he's doing is anti-team.

 

I'd say the "team spirit" in Boston is pretty low right now... Is it only Timmah's doing? I don't think so... I think it's a confidence issue on BOTH your goalies...

Buffalo game - toss one, stick in another... each one gives up 3...
 
 
 
That's true...

 

Yep, it is true. They've been a very up and down team and have been for the last few seasons.

I think there's something very wrong in that locker room right now and I think it begins with Tim Thomas. He was never a popular guy with the team to begin with and what he's doing is only magnifying things.

And you obviously haven't been watching many Bruins games. Their defense has been shoddy and they have had a lack of overall effort on the ice. It's not like Timmy and Tuukka have been giving up bad goals night in and night out while the rest of the team has been killing it. But you don't give a fuck about the team so what would you know, right?
 
 
Blaming one guy for your team's obvious issues is pretty weak...

But then again, we're talking to a Boston fan...

You really like to just make stuff up and/or only address want you want to.

I said I think the locker room problems start with Thomas.

I also said the defense has been shoddy, that the team hasn't been putting much effort out on the ice lately, and that they've been playing down to the level of their competition.

But, hey continue to make things up as you go along.

Make shit up? You're the one who want's to lay the bulk of the problems on Timmah's feet... You changing your tune now? I'm not surprised...

Lets face it - Hockey isn't your strength... Stick to football, golf or tennis....

So now, I'm just blaming "the bulk" of it on Thomas where before you said I was only blaming Thomas. Oh, what a tangled web you have weaved for yourself.

Yes, I think the number one problem is Thomas. Between his less than stellar play on the ice and the problems he is bringing to the locker room I think out of everyone on the roster, he stands out.

You yourself were all about the Bruins goaltending issue and citing that you think the team's "spirit" issues stems from their lack of confidence in both goalies. Sounds to me like you think their issues begin with the two guys in net but your refusal to admit (probably because that nature of the distraction and our political differences) that Timmy isn't the most liked guy in the room and that he's bringing outside distractions to the team is also part of the problem.

Let's face it, I know my hockey just fine and you are trying to talk out of both sides of your mouth.
 
 
 
 
 
It's not happening next year, is it?

 

Oh, you mean date of implementation. OK, but that's always been up in the air. There's a lot of details to work out but it needs to be done.

 

the plan was rejected by the players union recently....

 

I've been away for a few months. More of the same then I suppose.

They weren't, really, IMHO... I have to wonder how much of that was propaganda from the Nash camp... Something "may" have been done, but the price was WAY too high and the rangers have enough depth on offense..

Sather did exactly what I was hoping they would - stay away from the bonehead trades and pick up a defenseman... They got Scott for a 5th round pick - a solid (literally) D-man who won't take shit... D is where there are some question marks on the Rangers and if they can stay away from the concentration lapses, this trade will shore that up nicely...

Playoffs should be FUN!
 
 
Yeah....

The Rangers straight up have the Bruins number at this point.

I'm watching Lundquist play the worst game I've ever seen him play and the B's are finding a way to lose this.

They are going to have to really step their game up in the playoffs to win series against them.
 
 
Marty "Red Light" Turco? Really???

The kid they called up couldn't handle the what, maybe 5-6 games left in the regular season that they'd be resting Timmy?

He can't play in the playoffs.

I understand going with a veteran, but still... Strange move...
 
 
Wheels coming off the Bruins....

Chara needs to just mug Matt Cooke or something.

This is awful.

I would give the argument merit if thomas' numbers were way off his averages over the last few years but they aren't.  Tim Thomas Career Stats | Boston Bruins | Career Stats and Trends | NHL Hockey | FOX Sports on MSN

The Bruins are just playing so poorly right now.

They have the ability to turn it around and make a run for the cup, but right now they're repeatedly making dipshit plays...dumb mistakes a team with the right mindset doesn't make, the B's in November being a good example.

Yeah they aer back to the way they started the season, the momentum should hopefully swing back around as some injuries heal and the new guys get used to their linemates and Julien's system.

However they will lose tonight, i'm going to the game

I have a bad feeling tonight too...5-0 against the Leafs so far, so they're due for a loss against them.

They also won their last game which definitely doesn't bode well based on their play since January.

Have fun anyway...who knows maybe the turnaround starts tonight.
 
 
I was wrong in a big way, B's up 7-0 in the third.
 
 
If only the B's could play the Leafs every game.

What is it, three wins in a row for the B's?

Seidenberg and Chara forming a shut-down duo akin to last years cup run, Peverley returning, even Rolston is contributing. When they're on they probably have the best set of lines in the league from one through four.

I'm as usual pretty stoked about the NHL playoffs, more so because of how the B's are getting it together again, at about the perfect time.

They played (bruins) horrible that first period, thank god Thomas made some saves.

You and me both. Their season was so Jeckyl and Hyde. The easily played the longest and best stretch of hockey that any team in the league played all season then played.500 hockey for three months. They ended the season well though, and were able to rest a lot of players the last handful of games.

The Washing series is certainly no guarantee.
