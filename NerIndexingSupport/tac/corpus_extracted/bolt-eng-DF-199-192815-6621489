Can't seem to find much in English by Googling. Was wondering why he was allowed exile and why Saudie Arabia?
 
 
If you try googling Idi Amin, you might find more info. :wink:
 
 
 

Thank you. I did find more.

From a quick look it appears Saudi Arabia gave him exile and a government stipend because he was muslim. But, he was a convert, not born muslim. Will have to read more to find out when he converted.

Was wondering if there were other reasons, perhaps political. What did Saudi Arabia gain from it?
 
 
Interesting question. Not so sure Saudi Arabia gained anything other than perhaps some goodwill from the International community. Deposed leaders going into exile has been going on for ages. I'd never really looked at what the "host" gained (if anything) from it though.
 
 
Possibly they accepted him because he fit in so well - being so humble, and all.
 
 
Loads of cash likely, stolen from starving plebes.
