 
 
Who will be in the Champions League final this year?
 
 
 

  Barca?
    Man utd?
  Arsenal? Yh, they might have a chance

Real Madrid?  

Chelsea?  
 
 
I can see another Utd vs Barcelona final.

Chelsea arent as strong as they used to be.
Arsenal are trying to get back on track.
Madrid never make an impact in CL.

Utd are on fire and Barcelona are getting even stronger now with the new buys like Fabregas and Sanchez. With their strongest starting X, most of the time they win when it counts.
 
 
I'll say Real Madrid and Man City. That'd be a good one.
 
 
real madrid and barcelona
 
 
Man Utd vs Man City.
 
 
I would love to see Barcelona vs Manchester City
 
 
Barcelona vs Man U/Man City
 
 
Hard to predict two teams when they could be drawn earlier in the competition.

Feel Madrid will be there and Barca won't, not sure on the rest.
 
 
United - City would be incredible.
 
 
Barca could easily meet Utd in the Semis or something so there's no good saying they will meet in the Final.

Arsenal and Barca - quote me on this

I joke
 
 
United and City, in Munich, oh the irony.

But seriously I think it'll be another rematch of last years final.
 
 
im not interested in barca games - so i hope they dont get far. Hoping for Chelsea - Real.
 
 
As painful as it is to admit, Manchester United look set to win it again, nobody is matching their football in Europe at the moment (although still early on).

Their noisier rivals may think they've got a chance of doing something, but it's all untested waters for them as a club. They may battle on valiantly like Tottenham last season, but they'll not disturb the final.

Wouldn't be surprised to see Real in the final this time, either. They were a hell of a lot more assured last season and had they not faced the best team of our generation in the Semi's, could've easily had the trophy.
 
 
  @ All the sheep saying "another Utd-Barca final" know nothing about footie and expect lightning to keep striking twice and not realising surprises are possible when someone like Borussia Dortmund really could be a dark horse to get to the final and why not? Whether or not they could beat Barca or Real is another matter but nobody thought they could possibly beat Juve in 97 and they did. And interestingly this years final is in Munich just like in 97 albeit in a different stadium. Food for thought.
 
 
Well Barca have strengthened their team, and they won last year so it would be a safe bet to say them in the final.

I reckon Barca - Milan.
 
 
Theres a few teams that could be in the this year but i can pretty much be sure barcalona will be there. With no doubt either manu, man city if there in it cant remember or chelsea. Arsenal have nae chance.

milan. i.e the milan 2 years ago raped by united, and the milan beaten last year by spurs. You having us on?

Cant pick a final as people have said, might meet in quarters, but in the semis I have united city barca and real, providing they miss each other. but as they probably wont, ill have dortmund in there as a fourth.
 
 
 
milan. i.e the milan 2 years ago raped by united, and the milan beaten last year by spurs. You having us on?

 

No, I am not.
 
 
I'd say United Barcelona again. getting a bit boring tbh. Barca that is. Passing in triangles until their opponents collapse from boredom. really annoys me. I'd love to see Borussia Dortmund get there but I don't see it happening.
 
 
 
No, I am not.

 

fair enough. clearly cant see it myself, do they even have any good players any more?
 
 
Some of the best teams might meet earlier on but I think the final will be made up of 2 out of these 4 teams; Manchester United, Barcelona, Real Madrid and Manchester City.

I really can't see any other team that has the potential to beat those four.

Perfect Semi-Final;

Manchester United vs Real Madrid
Manchester City vs Barcelona

Perfect Final;

Manchester United vs Barcelona.

*I'm a Manchester United supporter.
 
 
Not sure on final but I think it will be Barca, City, Madrid and United in the semis.
 
 
Not sure if City will cope in Europe, can see it between United/Barca/Madrid/Bayern this year, with Chelsea with an outside chance if they can find their rhythm under AVB.
 
 
 
fair enough. clearly cant see it myself, do they even have any good players any more?

 

Yeah they have some decent players. It's more wishful thinking, I quite like Milan.

City have a squad capable of winning the quadruple imo.
 
 
 
 

  Barca?
    Man utd?
  Arsenal? Yh, they might have a chance

Real Madrid?  

Chelsea?  

 

I actually lol'd when I read 'Arsenal'
 
 
 
im not interested in barca games - so i hope they dont get far. Hoping for Chelsea - Real.

 

Chelsea vs Real. That'll be a final. I think Barcelona will lose to Madrid or Man utd/chelsea before they get to the final.
 
 
Okay no need to rub it in :/
 
 
 
City have a squad capable of winning the quadruple imo.

 

The squad does, but the importance of the club having the ability to is somewhat different and vastly ignored by most fans IMO.

It's one thing to have a squad who on their day can win everything - Over half a dozen others can claim that though. Everything from the players to the board need to be born winners though. Do City have that throughout the club? IMO, no. Mancini is not a Champions League winning material manager. Brian Kidd is not part of a Champions League winning material backroom staff. To win this trophy, you need all of this or an incredible amount of luck/desire (i.e Dortmund '97).

City's group stage alone suggests luck isn't on their side in the early exchanges this year.
 
 
 
Perfect Final;

Manchester United vs Barcelona.
 

NO WAY. BORING. OVERRATED FIXTURE.

I'd rather Chelsea vs. Barca, Real vs. City, Utd-City, Byaern-City to name a few.
 
 
I don't get how everyone is writing chelsea off. I think their team is stronger. They had 2 bad seasons in the CL and could have won it 2 seasons in a row if john terry didn't slip and the ref saw the handball in the box when they faced barcelona. How are City who have hardly any experienced players in the CL be considered more than them, they'll get raped by madrid like tottenham did. Too much City hype.

The Chelsea XI can compete with anyone. In terms of squad depth, they've fallen behind not only in England but in Europe as well.

If they succeed at anything they'll need to put their eggs all in one basket and take a hit on their other competitions. That won't happen though, it'd be suicide at a club like Chelsea.

Who do milan have, in midfield their best guy is aquilani, the rest are 33 year olds who are past it and if it wasn't for inter's poor management under benitez inter should easily win Serie A. I don't know what happened with schalke because Man united pulled their pants down.

Look at their strikers, and compare that to Spurs fielding Crouch up front alone at the Bernabeu (FOR 15MINS) LOL. (NOT FORGETTING THE REST OF THEIR SQUAD)
 
 
Manchester United v Manchester City/ Barcelona
 
 
An El Clasico final.
 
 
 
Not sure if City will cope in Europe, can see it between United/Barca/Madrid/Bayern this year, with Chelsea with an outside chance if they can find their rhythm under AVB.

 

City have the best sqaud in PL. Their squad is probably second to Real's in whole of Europe.
 
 
Man Utd Vs Real Madrid

Fair, they have got an old midfield but you could say it was experienced. In fact, no other midfield in the world has as much experience accrued. Their strikeforce is good, Zlatan, Cassano, Pato, Robinho.

They won the double a season ago. Just because Man City have like 2 first team squads doesn't mean they'll win in all fronts. Chelsea's problem last season was the lack of cover in defence after injuries and all the strikers had a bad time, but look at our strike force now, even with torres not playing as well as he was at liverpool we still have Drogba/anelka/mata/sturridge to name a few.

We have depth, it's just that we don't have household names like man city, that was the chelsea team 6 years ago when mourinho first took charge. A bunch of good players doesn't mean success, look at real madrid, their second 11 would beat valencia and villareal and their first 11 is much better, yet they've hardly won anything besides the spanish cup. Barcelona had no depth at all last season and it got to the point where they had to use mascherano as a makeshift centre back and adriano as a left back when he's a winger and they won the double so depth isn't really that much of a factor.

It's like people look at fifa and say who will win the league by their ratings. That's why I get annoyed by the city hype, he couldn't win the CL at inter, what makes it that he can win it at City, Inter were rich at the time. City rant over lol.
 
 
Barcelona/Utd.... for the 2nd year in a row Goddamit

That is true, but Tottenham's midfield is actually quite good and you can't blame jenas for them losing.

I think City are a bunch of players who can rape small teams in fact they're just an english real madrid in fact even worse as Real Madrid have a better manager now.
Why did Mancini buy Nasri when he has silva/johnson/ballotelli/tevez already to name a few players? They're just buying household players and when they do everyone thinks wow they've won it for sure now.
 
 
 
Bandwagon

 

Thank god someone who agrees with me.
To be honest on paper I would say Man united/City/Chelsea are all equal on paper. City are a bunch of household names.
 
 
 
Arsenal and Barca

I joke

Ok true their strikers are good enough to win the CL but look at their defence, Nesta is 35 years old and is not as good as he used to be although the CB pairing is just about good enough. Zambrotta's past it since he left madrid and Abate and antonini are not good enough so the wing backs are not good enough.
 
 
  I swear half the people in this thread have never seen a game of football in their lives. Personal highlight:

"the board needs to be born winners"  

Also, City doubters, City aren't just a collection of induviduals. Mancini is a vastly underrated manager and he has actually gelled this squad together brilliantly. They'll be in the final if they don't meet Barca along the way.
 
 
ac milan vs manchester utd

Zambrotta never played for Madrid bro.

lol what do you mean the CB pairing is just about good enough. Nesta and Silva are probably in the top 3 CB partnerships in Europe. Nesta has been quality since last half of last season and the opening game against Lazio. Defenders have a much older age peak than midfielders and strikers and people like Ferdinand, Carvalho, Lucio and Puyol show this.

Zambrotta doesnt really start anymore, Abata has improved vaslty in defence and is the quicket Milan player in the squad. Left back is more problematic, the signing of Taiwo may proove to be a steal if he can perform, although I ve not seen too much of him.
 
 
 
 

  Barca?
    Man utd?
  Arsenal? Yh, they might have a chance

Real Madrid?  

Chelsea?  

 

I reckon Man City v Barcelona final. No bias ofcourse even though I am a City fan hehe.

I just think City are playing some amazing football at the moment and may provide the challenge needed to overcome Barcelona. No away teams will enjoy coming to CoMS, the atmosphere and support of the City fans is like having a 12th man on the pitch.

Realistically I do think City can go far in the Champions League even if they don't win it but out of the 4 English sides I reckon they look the strongest along with "the other team in Manchester".

Barcelona have to be the favourites. Real Madrid will be up there as will Chelsea although I feel Chelsea are weaker now than they were in previous years. Arsenal once again the dark horses and if City didn't win it then I would want Arsenal to win it but nothing of their season so far (well domestically) has suggested they will go any further than the round of 16.

AC Milan won't do much. Inter might have a sniff of a chance but they're nowhere near as good as they were under Mourinhio.

Can't see any of the other sides providing a stern test except possibly Bayern Munich.
 
 
 
Zambrotta never played for Madrid bro.

 

Eurghh I'm thinking of Cannavaro sorry, I mean barcelona right?

Are you serious?

Abate was brilliant going forward last year.. Nesta is as solid as he ever was. Thiago Silva is world class. Mexes will be pushing those two and Taye Taiwo is a very experienced fullback.

Pretty good defence in my eyes.
 
 
The only way I could see Arsenal going far in the Champions League would be if they were to do what Liverpool did back in the 2004/2005 season and sacrifice their domestic form and cup competitions in favour of getting far in the Champions League. Sure this may not be the best side Arsene Wenger has ever assembled but let's not forget that he is a world-class manager and quite possibly one of the best in the game at the moment. He is a footballing genius and it would be silly to completely dismiss Arsenal's chances in the Champions League. They've come close a number of teams and I feel they were robbed back in 2006.

What odds on an all English Champions League final? Man City v Arsenal?

Or how about Man City v Man Utd? the final to end all finals.

Defender's tend to lose their pace and strength over the years but still have their mental attributes which keeps them on to those late years. To be honest I haven't seen too much of nesta last season, I'm not a huge fan of italian football tbh.
 
 
Hmmmm this is a tough one. CL finals are very hard to predict because there are many top teams around.

Chelsea VS Real Madrid

I have this gut feeling lol
 
 
We won't get to the CL final.

I. No CL experience.
II. Inevitable City ballsups
III. We'll probably end up focusing on the league, which we have a better shot at winning.
 
 
6 possible teams and 3 dark horses. In order of most likely:
1) Barca (undeniably huge favourites with the signings of fabregas and sanchez on top of arguably the greatest team of all time adds something united ooze which is depth in the squad. Best squad in the world, no doubt about it)
2) Man U (Made a phenomenal start to their domestic campaign with signings which look to have made a huge impact and look odds on favourites to teach the semi's at least, assuming they don't play barca before that)
3) Real (Have made a good signing in the Turk midfielder Sahin who has been fantastic for Dortmund and will be a sore miss for them but whether or not they can test the likes of Man U or Barca is questionable.)
4) Chelsea (Yet another year has gone by for Abramovic with no CL title but this year they will run it close I think because Raul Meireles and Mata are very good signings and depending on whether Torres can regain form will determine their season I believe. Biggest loss is Essien which may prove to be crucial as he's imo the best overall midfielder in the PL as their is no area he's weak in.)
5) Bayern (Made the final 2 years ago and an even better side now. They've addressed their GK situation with the signing of Neuer arguably the best keeper in world football. Perfect balance in their squad. Front 3 of Gomez, Ribery and Robben are immense and up there with the best of them. With a very solid midfield and defence they have what it takes to go far, many game-changing players)
6) Man City (Have made the biggest progress in the last 2 years. No doubt the best squad of attackers in the world. With such variety in their squad they can't help but not be contenders. First year in the CL is tough but they have what it takes. No obvious weakness in the squad and you'd think even if there was, January would loosen the purse strings of the owners even further)

Dark horses - Dortmund, Napoli, Arsenal
Failures who'll get kicked out by last 16- Inter, AC Milan, Villareal, Lille

  Clichéd ****, Essien was terrible last season.

It might be tempting fate but I reckon the days of "Typical City" cock-ups may well be at an end. The football they're playing at the moment is a far cry from what they were doing 5 years ago. Man think about those days under Keegan and Pearce? I think City have a good chance in every competition they enter and I think they will give the Champions League equal attention to the Premier League if not slightly more so with the exposure that comes with the Champions League.

I always say that if I had to pick between the two I would take the Champions League over the Premier League due to the exposure the final gets and just that by winning it we would be crowned the best team on the continent and then have the potential to win the Club World Cup even though it may not be such a massive deal right now but it is growing in stature.

City want to dominate the world and there's no reason why they can't do it sooner rather later.
 
 
Barcelona is there. If they can't get there on their own UEFA will put them there. Again. For the third time.
Real Madrid, Man Utd, Chelsea, City for the other slot.

Milan bought mexes? No idea they did, then I take it back their defence is as good as before. Though it's the italian league where the play is slower and less physical generally compared to the EPL. The champions league stage is different where they'll be at faster tempos and more physical than italian league.
 
 
 
Eurghh I'm thinking of Cannavaro sorry, I mean barcelona right?

 

Yup Zambrotta was at Barca. You're right though, he wasn't that good at Barca. But Milan have Abate, Taiwo, Antonini at full back. Defence is really strong, as is midfield. I reckon they could surprise people.

Ye that is where they generally come up short. I still feel their midfield is weak creativly, they have good defensive midfielders in Van Bommel, Gattuso and Flamini but only Aqualani and Kevin-Prince Boating are capable of some spark. Not sure about Nocerino either, a recent signing from Palermo.

IV, but will settle for carling cup loool. In all seriousness if they keep the same form then well it's likely that they could do a clean sweep. But I said this last season for chelsea and we won nothing.

I would still say that inter are better than them, Milito was poor last season after his injury, Motta didn't really get played enough, but Inter should be better than AC milan, I can see why mourinho left there lol.

Inter did lose the italian super cup though. Plus they lost 3-0 to man city as well in pre season. Italian football has lost it's edge, they were strong in the late 90's/early 00's but since the calcapolli scandal every team has declined a bit, especially juventus, who i really wanna see back in the CL.

Abate was brilliant going forward last year.. Nesta is as solid as he ever was. Thiago Silva is world class. Mexes will be pushing those two and Taye Taiwo is a very experienced fullback.

Pretty good defence in my eyes.

 

Abate was a right midfielder who converted to a right back like andre santos for arsenal or michel bastos, he would be brilliant going forward, I haven't seen loads of him, so maybe it's unfair to comment on his defending but I don't really rate him that much though i've only seen one or two matches.
 
 
I was thinking about making a thread on this 2 days ago lol.

Earlier you said he wasn't good enough. Now he's brilliant going forward   Make your mind up.

For the record, he's not that bad defensively either. Your criticism of Milan was uninformed and unfair really.
 
 
I reckon if we tried hard enough then Celtic could get reinstated all the way to the cl final...
 
 
I'm going to say Barca United..... so it doesn't ****ing happen again  
 
 
 
I reckon if we tried hard enough then Celtic could get reinstated all the way to the cl final...

 

Forget that I reckon we could have them awarded the trophy by default hehehe.

Saying all that I do have a soft spot for Celtic as my 2nd team with Manchester city being my first team. I'm glad Celtic got their place back in the Europa League and I hope they can go far in the competition although they have a horrendous group to negotiate.

Are you having us on. I literally laughed out loud at 'teams wont enjoy coming to the COMS'. You never fill your ground. So start doing that first before you start making out that teams will be scared of going to your ground. They maybe scared of your team, but not the ground of first timers in the CL with no recent european history. Its not exactly like going to the San Siro, OT, Bernabeau or the Camp Nou now is it. And you say youre playing great football, but look what United did to you in a half of fotball. Raped. City are a top team, but not top 2 in europe as a team. Come up against us or madrid and I think youll lose. But I have you in the semis in my pick, just united barca or madrid I feel will beat you.

edit: forgot Seedorf who is still a great player, reminds me of Giggs

 

Gattuso is past his peak tbh, Seedorf is still a great player, reminds me more of scholes since he's in the middle of the park. KPB is quite good, well I watched him in the world cup last year he reminds me a bit of ramires who would force his way through with his pure speed.
Seedorf may be a great player but do you think he'll handle a team like barcelona where you need a lot of stamina and speed to do something? Look at Giggs in the final, he couldn't do anything because he's lost his pace from before and nani should have played there instead i believe. Giggs was a CM that match, so I'm sure the same thing will happen to seedorf come tuesday.
 
 
 
I just want Milan, it would be a nice surprise. It'd be boring if it were Barca vs Man Utd again.

 

Yeah. I think that Man Utd have stepped it up a level and are as good as their 2009 team if not better. There is literally no problem with defence compared to 2009 if vidic got injured wes brown or evans would take his place, Evans has improved a lot this season, last season he was poor but he's playing pretty solid atm. Phil jones is just wow!!!! Young did what you expected him to do and rip the team apart. Valencia hasn't even played yet.
Chelsea vs real madrid final. Real madrid have improved in the CL from getting beat by lyon nearly every season and Chelsea have been stupidly unlucky in recent seasons, they had two bad seasons in the CL, they faced inter, who had literally no problem winning the CL besides that second leg of the semi final against barcelona and just got out of a bad spell when they faced united, if it was at the start of the season Chelsea would have been in the semi final. Man City quarter/semi finalists, same for barcelona and man united, Arsenal are a wildcard, but by watching how they played against swansea, I'll be surprised if they got a result vs dortmund let alone the likes of the big boys. Bayern munich quarters. Milans at quarters. Lille and Napoli/Villareal/leverkusen gone by round of 16.
 
 
 
Earlier you said he wasn't good enough. Now he's brilliant going forward   Make your mind up.

For the record, he's not that bad defensively either. Your criticism of Milan was uninformed and unfair really.

 

Fine fair enough about abate I'll look at him if I see milan play. I just don't think milan have that umph to win, their team are too old I think and 5 years ago were in their prime, hence getting to 2 CL finals around that time and winning one of them. KPB, van bommel and aquilani vs pirlo, gattuso and ambrosini, I think the latter were better in their prime with world cup winners too.
 
 
Bayern and Man Utd.
 
 
 
I would love to see Barcelona vs Manchester City

 

come on barca!
 
 
 
City have a squad capable of winning the quadruple imo.

 

It is one thing to have a good deep team in the league(on paper), it is quite another in Europe where experience of playing European games, mentality and luck all play a huge factor. People are seriously overestimating this start, the season is long and better teams than City have found it tough to cope with the fixture congestion, especially with big midweek European ties. Let us not forget that on paper, City probably had the best squad for Europa League, and we know how that ended.
 
 
Barca v United and I reckon UTD will give them a tough one this year. Barca to win 3 - 2.
 
 
 
come on barca!

 

That would be interesting, think it would be like chelsea vs barcelona two years ago, they'll be an equal match, or they'll crumble in one leg like real madrid. I think that it would be 2-2 if they faced each other. Madrid vs Man City however, a rape will be witnessed and man city won't know what hit them i.e. Ronaldo and Benzema time.
 
 
United Madrid.
 
 
Any other teams apart from Barcelona and Man utd.
 
 
 
  Clichéd ****, Essien was terrible last season.

Also, care to elaborate on the Milan clubs?

 

It was tough for Essien last year and although I'd say it wasn't his best season due to many niggling injuries (started I think 24/38 PL games last season) he played a role which was very alien to him I thought. Essien is looked at as a holding midfielder but there's so much more to him than that. The fact that Ramires and Lampard were bombarding forward meant Essien sometimes had to just sit back. Without Ramires last season it's likely Mikel would have played and meant that Essien could roam about more which is his chop and trade. So yes he was well below par but I still hold firm that he is the best overall midfielder in the PL.

As for the Milan clubs, I think it's tough to predict how far they're going to get. As Juventus is looking to form a team based on technique, guile (Pirlo, Krasic, Elia, Vidal) and brute force (Chiellini, Amauri, Iaquinta, Vucinic) and certainly my favourites this year, the Milan clubs, Inter especially look to be a team in rapid decline. With the loss of Eto'o arguably their best player to reduce their wage bill, I think they now have a squad based on players above 30. No world class players below 28 and so will struggle as the season goes on. AC on the other hand do have a very young squad but have no real guile in midfield especially after the loss of Pirlo. Seedorf is now reaching the end of his days and can't get around as most playmakers do. There is no kaka's or deep-lying playmakers anywhere in the team. The midfield is packed to just shut up shop with gattuso, ambrosini and flamini often the chosen 3. Their defence is pretty strong now that Thiago Silva has reached his full potential and at a world class level as well as having good young full backs like Abate in particular. As for their attack, it is nothing short of devastating with 4 world class players. Ibra, Cassano, Robinho and Pato are easily at the top level in football but with no inspiration in midfield it's often left to Pato and Robinho on the wings to take on full backs and create something magical either by themselves or to Ibrahimovic. Both Milanese clubs with struggle I think but you can never rule them out.
 
 
It's impossible to predict - even if there were two teams which were miles better than any other, there would still be a just-under-50% chance of them being on the same side of the draw and meeting before the final.
 
 
2 of Barca Madrid & United. Depends on the runthrough each team has though..
 
 
I have a feeling it'll be an El Clasico final. Madrid have the strongest team on paper by a fair distance (as well as experience of the CL) and Barcelona in the final is almost a certainty given their performances over the past few years. Last season's clash between the two sides could have had quite a different result if Madrid had scored first imo. Though, i don't know if the two sides are likely to face each other in earlier stages again this year.

City will probably get to the last 16, but i don't see them getting further than that. Yes, they've strengthened their squad (which was already one of the strongest in the PL), but i think a lot of people are predicting their success this season with the first few results they've had. Remember Chelsea last season? They were demolishing teams early on but had a severe dip in form afterwards. It's still to be seen whether City can maintain their form and if Mancini can really get the best out of his players, especially in the CL which they've had little experience of.

I'm going to go out on a limb here and write off Arsenal getting past the last 16 as well. I thought they did pretty well against Barca last year (at least when compared to the year before) and were a bit unlucky but losing Nasri and Fabregas will hit them hard. The players they've signed just aren't of the same quality and they still have the defensive problems of past seasons. Losing to United in the manner that they did exposed their lack of squad depth and you can argue it was special circumstances given the number of injuries/suspensions, but i don't think any top 4 side should be conceding that many.

Finally, i think that my own team (United) will probably make it to the semis. We've strengthened our squad, but i think we've been lucky with fixtures in the past couple of years. If we come across Madrid or Barca, it'll probably be the end of the line for us unless we have a bit of luck.

Thank you. I think Madrid are better than United, people will disagree, but Madrid and Barcelona are the best clubs. Man united seem to get good fixtures, although the past few years have been english/spanish domination with a lucky inter squad. I think Chelsea are a dark horse if AVB gets them to the standard the players of that calibre should be playing, I personally think their squad is as strong as the past few years, we made a stupid mistake selling ballack and carvalho without providing proper backup so when essien/lampard and alex got injured we messed up if luiz had been bought in august we could have won the league, Deco had to leave unlucky because of his son but I feel he had a lot to offer if that didn't happen to him.
 
 
 
Bayern and Man Utd.

 

I would love to see United absolutely destroy those cheating ****ers!
 
 
I'd love to see United-Real with Vidic snapping Ronaldo  
 
 
 
I would love to see United absolutely destroy those cheating ****ers!

 

Bayern are crap. How did they not win their league last season, look at their bloody attack, they should have just bought boateng and neuer last season.
 
 
Predicting it now is impossible and ridiculous, even after the group stages it´s hard, but saying one team will get that far is almost impossible.

E.g City could meet Barcelona in the round of 16.
 
 
 
I would love to see United absolutely destroy those cheating ****ers!

 

Why are they cheaters? And I don´t think a final between those teams would be one sided at all.
 
 
Wow, why did I get some negative reps for criticizing the masses that know very little about football who blindly say "it'll be another Barca-Man U final" when in reality there is no reason why a dark horse cannot get to the final and besides if Liverpool could pull of that mega-fluke win in 2005 then almost anything can be possible?

Liverpool are surprisingly good in the champions league when they're in it but they're so dodgy it's unbelievable. That's the one team i'll never count out because they usually are in the quarters or the semi's, if rafa benitez was good at one thing at liverpool, it was having good runs in the champions league. Plus madrid are better than united, there I said it.
 
 
Got a hunch Madrid will get there, controversially. Probably up against United.
 
 
 
Forget that I reckon we could have them awarded the trophy by default hehehe.

Saying all that I do have a soft spot for Celtic as my 2nd team with Manchester city being my first team. I'm glad Celtic got their place back in the Europa League and I hope they can go far in the competition although they have a horrendous group to negotiate.

 

Well they are my team haha. I reckon they can negociate 2nd place to be honest, they rarely lose at home in Europe even against teams such as Ac Milan and Man Utd. That being said our away from is pathetic and we'll do well to get any points against The Italian side.

I can see Man City at least reaching the semi finals if they don't draw barca or real early in the knock outs.
 
 
4 main contenders are Real madrid, barca, United and City
 
 
Well, if we are talking about the two teams that are the best in Europe, it'd have to be Barca vs. Real Madrid.

Not many teams could take a place in the final from those two. Both Manchester sides have a chance, not sure about Chelsea yet, next week will be a real test for them. I have a feeling an Italian team will be up there (most likely being one of the Milan teams). Can't see any German side getting to the Semi's, even though FC Bayern Munich are looking quite good in the League. Dortmund could be a dark horse (current Bundesliga champions).

In reality, this season, the only way I see Barca/Real not both being in the final is if they draw each other earlier in the knock-out rounds.
 
 
Barca won't win it twice in a row. It'll be either United, City or Madrid. Most likely United for me.

Yeah to be fair Celtic are almost non-existent away from home in Europe. The last time they picked up anything near a decent result as far back as I can remember was when they beat Liverpool at Anfield en-route to the 2003 Uefa Cup Final and then a 0-0 draw with Barcelona at the Nou Camp the following season. But considering how both those teams are faring now makes those achievements seem like a lifetime ago.

It'll be tricky as Atletico and Udinese are decent sides. Can't remember who the other team were in group was it PSG? No hang on it's Rennes. Atletico aren't as good now seeing as they lost two of their best players Aguero and Forlan so Celtic may well fancy their chances at home and possibly a draw in Madrid. I reckon they'll probably draw at home to Udinese and lose away in Italy and could quite possibly get two wins against Rennes but maybe that's wishful thinking.

I think there's a lot riding on this Europa League campaign not just for the club but the SPL too. Ever since the Champions League places were redistributed and the Uefa Cup folded the Scottish teams seem to have been squeezed out of the picture but also in no small part thanks to their poor performances. Celtic in many ways were fortunate to be given this place and I think given the money woes a good campaign e.g. quarters or semis if not all the way, would give them some much needed exposure on the continent and beyond. Only just a few weeks ago I could hear the moans and groans of people marking the death of Scottish Club football.

Sure there's a lack of investment and I don't see a oil-laden Sheikh coming to Glasgow anytime soon but I don't believe the fact their an "unattractive proposition". I might be right in saying they're well inside the top ten most supported teams in the world with more than a million fans in the United States and Canada alone and 9 million plus worldwide. I can't even say that my beloved Man City could claim to have figures like that even home or abroad, well not yet anyways.

I think what Celtic need isn't huge investment but reasonable amount of funds and they would do well to try and attract players who may well be fading from the big leagues and try to snap them up from the temptation of the money and lifestyles of playing the MLS, middle-east and Russia. Playing for Celtic carries far more prestige than those 3 mentioned leagues. Let's be fair the Russian league until recently simply made up the numbers in European competition but now they're getting huge investments. I mean you can't say Samuel Eto'o went to Russia because of the footballing pedigree or the warm-reception he'll get from the Russian fans (quite the opposite re: racism in Russian Football).

MLS; you can't say David Beckham and Robbie Keane went there for glory nights.

I don't think Celtic will ever be challenging for the Champions League but there's no reason why with some investment and being a bit more shrewd in the transfer market even if it means casting eyes further afield to the likes of Africa and Asia, there's no reason why they can't become Champions League regulars again in the near future and frankly I think the Champions League is less exciting without them.

You're right about Celtic and the leagues. I want to see Liverpool again, they're always a dark horse in the CL and surprise loads of teams, they even beat madrid 4-0 once. They're just stupidly inconsistant in the league.
 
 
I bet most of the same people saying "Utd-Barca" final are probably some of the same sheep-like ignoramuses who back in 2006 said things like "OMFG, Brazil are the best, Ronaldinho is just too good and will win the World Cup easily and no-one else stands a chance". Please, do us a favour and talk about some topics you may know something about because it sure hell isn't football.

Real Madrid v Bayern
 
 
Barca v Real.  

By far the 2 best XI's and squads atm.
 
 
I will admit that, if we can change the theme of this thread to who you would like to see in the final (i.e. what is your dream final?) as opposed to who you think it will be then I would be interested in a Barca-Real final just because it has never happened before. But I would still love to see Dortmund as winners beating Barca or Real.
 
 
 
An El Clasico final.

 

Guarantee that it won't happen. A CL final always gets a massive amount of viewers but having Barca/Madrid play a 2 legged fixture will bring in far more money and viewers and be a better advert for the Champions League.

I expect the following fixtures to come about in the knock-outs at one stage or another.

Barca v Real Madrid
Man City v Man Utd
Porto v Chelsea
Chelsea v Real Madrid

Just because they will make great tv.

I just hope chelsea don't get real madrid. But yeah they'll be matches I wanna see. Chelsea vs Man united doesn't have that rivalry anymore. Chelsea vs Barcelona would be a good match too.

Chelsea v Real Madrid will happen, I think it will be the quarter-final match. They will want to hype up the Mourinho v AVB match up - can the mentor or the protege come out on top?

Chelsea v Porto - Round 16
Chelsea v Real Madrid - Quarter-finals
Real Madrid v Barcelona - Semi-finals

Is how I expect them to want it to line up. The I expect the other 3 English teams to be on the other side of the draw with Man City v Man Utd in the other Quarter-final.

Yeah, but since it's a draw you never know, it's like the CL has a storylline like it's wrestling haha. Chelsea vs porto will happen I think, Chelsea will get to the semis I think. Probably get Porto/Arsenal in the quarters and shaktar/lille in the round of 16 while porto will face someone like napoli/villareal. I think chelsea'll get a good run, they usually lose to the winners of the CL or the finalists in recent seasons and should have won it by now. Man United will get a hard match in the quarters like barcelona and Man City will get an easy match in the round of 16 and face madrid in quarters where they'll lose.

  Oh, so your a psychic now. Sorry, I'd forgotten, was gonna watch the CL tomorrow night, not a lot of point now.

Fair enough. I mean that's what i'll like to happen. Would be funny if it happened like I said though.
 
 
If I had to put my life on it, I'd have to say Barca vs Madrid. United and City have a decent chance. Chelsea also have a realistic chance. I'd have Bayern as my dark horses. After that, I can't see anyone else reaching the final barring a fluke.
 
 
Barcelona.
 
 
People saying Man City are embarrassing themselves.
 
 
 
People saying Man City are embarrassing themselves.

 

I think now is the time to say that people saying man city are embarrassing themselves, it looks like it's napoli and bayern going through, and if they go through they're not as good as bayern, how are they gonna beat chelsea, man utd and the spanish?
 
 
I have a feeling man city won't even make it out of the group stages  
 
 
I'm gonna say Bayern Vs Man Utd, bayern are class so far this season whilst man utd look so very refreshed and when vidic and cleverly return it will be hard to stop them.

Inter is a shadow of what it was under mourinho, and JM was an amazing man manager thats why they won.

Man city are too inexperienced in the champions league as seen vs napoli/bayern

Barcelona, sure they have mastered total football but they seem to be weak at the back and conceaded easily in the league to villarael and others
 
 
 
I have a feeling man city won't even make it out of the group stages  

 

Like I said, man city will NOT go far, they might do well in the league but they'll get 2nd at most.
Chelsea vs Madrid final I believe.
Munich/barca/man united and maybe a milan team also are as likely.
Mancini was always bad with the Champions league with inter anyway, if he couldn't do it with them, how can he do it with man city. Ridiculous City hype, he should go and focus on the league, which united or chelsea will win.

Yeah that's actually a good final. I think it was a fluke Bayern getting to the final 2 years ago, but with their defence now sorted and one of the best strike and midfield forces with young players they can really go far.
 
 
I have a strange feeling Chelsea could do well. Torres looks to be getting some form but is, IMO more importantly, adding to the teams creatively with his hanging back and passing.

Mata's a revelation for them and Lampards proving to be a super sub. Team looks very solid all the way through and ruthlessly efficient. They should be the dark horses of the tournament.

Not sure who will face them. Not sure if Barca will win it again this year. A lot of teams have a subdued year the year after winning the Cup. Theres a heck of a lot of good German and English squads this year.
 
 
 
United and City, in Munich, oh the irony.

 

Incredibly poor taste but undeniably funny.

it seems muller and co are doing well, they have so many versatile players. luiz gustavo can play anywhere in defense or DM/CM role. badstubber looks really good and they finally fixed their goalkeeper problem with neur.

either way, it should be a mad final !

Barcelona's defence is what's ruining them at the moment, Abidal I think is starting to decline. I think that barcelona are still a really good team don't get me wrong, but I think that they won't win it again. I wouldn't really want chelsea to face them but we had a close game with them last time and we've gone better since then. I just hope chelsea don't face real madrid or man united until the semis.

Yeah, I think it will be too. The 2010 CL was the worst I've seen in recent years though, it's like inter won it with ease minus the second leg of the barca match which they didn't even try to win. 2011 was much better.
 
 
It will be Barca and MANU!!!/Inter
Man city will make it to semi
Arsenal wouldnt even get to the quarters cos there **** so far.
Chelsea defo quarter maybe not final.
Inter will make it to semi or final
AC milan eh well jus quarters
jeventus maybe quarters
real maybe quarters

I wouldn't really want chelsea to face them but we had a close game with them last time and we've gone better since then. I just hope chelsea don't face real madrid or man united until the semis.

 

True. In fairness with Barca's gameplan they could field 10 year olds in defence and still win! Teams 'seem' to get less than 20% possession against them. Not literally but with their smothering midfield and chasing game they dont seem to require and out and out defence like Man Utd. Just looking at the final last year - they fielded Abidal, who was only a week or so back from injury as well as Mascherano! They even used Busquets a while back against Madrid!

With Barca they seem to have a great first team, defence included. Its just the drop off after that thats alarming. Injurys and defence problems might hinder them this year. That said Pique and Puyol are class acts.

It's true, they have great tactics, I may not like the way they play, I'm more of a fast paced football guy, I don't like playing piggy in the middle but it wins games. They have a good second team in attack and midfield but a rubbish second team in defence.

Ah well said - What team d'ya support by the way?

Chelsea. Probably why I think they'll be in the final, plus mata, torres and sturridge making a new front 3.

Hahah thought so. I knew there was something up or a bit of bias involved if someone agreed with my stance's regarding a club!

Fine starting front three. You have that fella, eh, Drogba? Yeah a decent enough sub I suppose!

Yeah, plus anelka and malouda(who is only good for assisting goals) on the bench. Seeing as they were the front 3 last season and worked really well for the first half of the season that's a good bench.
 
 
football is unpredictable.Most likely Barca.And in current form Bayern could be there too.It practically would be a match between top 2 international teams: Spain vs Germany.Dont wanna see United again unless someones takes Barca out before the final.Madrid has a chnace too but Mourinho needs to become less whiny and Ronaldo less sellfish.I dont see any other top team besides United in England.City has not a team,Chelseas golden periods is over,Arsenal well.... no comment.It will be between Barca,Madrid,Bayern,Man United.
 
 
Barcelona v Madrid/United

Don't rule out Bayern.

Chelsea to make the quarters.

I may be biased but please tell me how our golden period is over? We didn't win a trophy last season even though we were close to winning the league even with a 15 point gap between the leaders, we won the double the season before. We didn't win any trophies when mourinho left and grant took over but the next year we won the fa cup and ancelotti came and won us the double?
We have a new younger team as well so you can't say we're too old and when we faced man united a few weeks ago we matched them in nearly every aspect but they just took their chances and we didn't. Last season with our start you wouldn't have said our golden period is over, even though united started the way we started this season.
I can take you saying we're not reaching the final, but saying that our golden period is over is a load of rubbish.

Chelseas golden period is over,as they had a better chance of winning the CL in the last 5-6 years than now.They should have won it in 2008 but were maybe a little bit unlucky.But now the competition is much tougher.Barca,Madrid,Bayern and to some extent even Man U and Milan are much stronger.Back then Chelsea was easily top 2 but now even top 4 might be slightly stretching it.They have a chance still but I wouldnt put my money on them.In premiere league they face a tougher competition with the team chemistry United has and the squad(probably the best in EPL) City has.Chelsea could become a top team(with a ongoing golden period) again by some incredibly performances(win EPL,CL) but until then the verdict is that there golden period is over.Plus financial fair play rule will restrict them even further.
 
 
anyone thinking arsenal could do a liverpool?  
 
 
Have to see transfers in January and possible injuries before making a decision

You do know that the highest we've payed for a player this season was 23 million. Man united spent 30 million on players although they're in debt, Man city have spent 60 million, liverpool have spent 60 million, we have spent 40 million. Who is messed up the most in terms of fair play? It's not chelsea for sure because we have a new team and don't need any players, man city will keep on buying players, liverpool don't have a clue on who they're buying tbh. Chelsea have a team for the next 5 years and that's a fact so we're not under pressure to get players.
So you're saying that chelsea aren't a top team, although over the past 5 years we're the 3rd best team in europe including last season? Ok the competition is a lot, but did you fancy man united's team to make the final of the champions league and win the prem? It looked like vidic and van der sar were the only consistant players for the first half of the season yet they won things.
Chelsea's team is as good as the 2008 team that got in the final and is as good as the 2009 team that should have got into the final, compare the team player for player and you'll say that too. We've had two bad years in the CL to our standards and we're written off as contenders(we lost to inter who won the CL with ease and lost to man united when we were just getting out of our crisis). Look at madrid and bayern, bayern were lucky to get into the final two years ago, and madrid has got into one semi final in like 7 years.
Also liverpool won the CL, that says it all.
You act like all we are is just money and we buy players for no reason, we're not man city, we make like 2 or 3 buys per season to areas that need strengthening, unlike city who buy two first teams so we're not going to be affected by fair play, man united are just as affected as we are if my assumptions about fair play are right and you only spent what your club earns as they've been in debt since the takeover.
 
 
I have an odd fancy that it would be someone surprising, Benfica maybe?

The usual educated guess would be Barcelona.
 
 
Barcelona agaisnt an English club is my lucky guess.

That is presuming, the inevitable dsnt happen, & da last 2 english clubs dnt get drawn with each other in quarters or semis
 
 
 
anyone thinking arsenal could do a liverpool?  

 

Mate, if Carlsberg made football seasons, that would be it. Imagine, after all this criticism, Wenger guides us to our second Champions League final and wins it, and we finish 6th jus to take da piss. Haha  
 
 
Chelsea could win it but they need to buy a new striker.
 
 
Barcelona vs. United/Real/Inter/random outsider.
 
 
I still think City can reach the final although it's looking like a tough task. But then again Liverpool lost the first 3 games of the group stages when they won the Champions League in 2004/2005. I'm hoping that things will "click" into place for City in Europe. It has too. It would be a disaster if they exited at the group stages. Believe me it's something I really do fear.

I actually think Arsenal have chance. They're pretty much out of the running for the Premier League title and I can't see them being too bothered about either of the domestic cups. So I think they'll focus on Europe for once and you may just get lucky.

I magine if you finished 6th and Spurs 4th and then you won the Champions League? Arsenal would qualify ahead of Spurs as the winners are guaranteed a spot and because they'd have finished outside the top 4 they'd take the place of whoever finished 4th.
 
 
 
Chelsea could win it but they need to buy a new striker.

 

What the hell are you talking about? So Torres getting back to form and Drogba being on the BENCH isn't enough, plus lukaku, sturridge and anelka aren't good enough as strikers. Sturridge has scored like 11 goals in 15 appearances but can't get into the striker spot so has to play on the wing. Make a statement when you look at the real picture. We don't have any problems in our team besides keeping a clean sheet, this whole slow midfield business is gone now, did you see the way they played against bolton.
Completely uninformed statement.
 
 
Dont think chelsea will make it past quarters. Barcelona vs Madrid for me unless they meet each other earlier. Dark horses Napoli and Bayern

Lol. Deluded mate. Chelsea can't compete with Barca/Real/United or even City. To say that they have a team for the next 5 years is mad too. Where's your world class replacements for Terry, Cole, Lampard, Drogba?

And to say Liverpool don't know who they're buying is stupid too. They bought players to 'steady the ship' if you like while we improve after losing all our players, a decent manager and gaining a **** manager all before Kenny came back.
 
 
bayern or utd or barca

In 5 years, We will still have cech, if we don't then we'll use thibaut courtois who we bought from genk and loaned out to athletico.
Defence, well we have bertrand, luiz, and we can buy one or two defenders.
Midfield, we have mceachran to replace lampard, Mikel, romeu and ramires are young and can play for another 5-10 years.
Attack well we have mata, torres, and sturridge who are our starting 11 players as well as lukaku who could become the next drogba given time, being the top goalscorer in the belgium league at the age of 18 is a massive acheivement no matter who you are. Have I proved my point?
Of course you'll need to buy one or two players to strengthen a team, but the main thing is that we don't need to change our team that much.
Also defenders can play at the top level till the age of 33-35, look at carvalho, so then we still have ivanovic and bosingwa too.
Also if giggs is still playing lampard can still play till at least 35/36.
So I'm not deluded.

Also the whole liverpool thing, Ok I get why they bought adam, he's a good player and he's cheap, but why did he buy henderson and bench meireles who's better than adam and henderson, downing was a good buy, but I think he was bought because joe cole didn't deliver which he's starting to do at lille.
Also why was aquilani loaned out when he was liverpool's best player in pre season? Kuyt was also relegated to the bench to give henderson who is not as good as him on the wing a chance to prove his price tag?
I think it's a fair assumption to make that they just bought a bunch of players, not like city did, but yeah.

Tell me how city are better than chelsea, because they won an FA cup after spending nearly 400million pounds? City hype. Also last time chelsea faced barcelona the match was close and they won by bad refereeing decisions and a great goal from iniesta, we weren't dominated, we drew to them twice and lost on away goals.
Plus last season we lost 1-0 to city, and we won 2-0 the next time.

Oh yeah the specific replacements are mceachran for lampard, Lukaku/torres/sturridge for drogba, bertrand for cole and luiz for terry just to answer the question.

Not going to lie to you mate but Chelsea just aren't going nowhere in the Champions league this season. Just my opinion though but it's a sensible one too.

I support Arsenal and It's acceptable to admit that they aren't going nowhere either.

Liverpool spent £35 million on Andy Carroll and £20 million on Jordan Henderson, yet sold Raul Meireles. As the poster who quoted you has said, we have Bertrand, McEachran, Lukaku, Luiz, Sturridge and Romeu all under twenty-three, so there you go. In the same vein, who do Liverpool have to replace Gerrard? Reina? Carragher?
 
 
No one can really tell, sometimes you underestimate squads which turn out to have world class players in retrospect. Everyone thought it was luck that Leverkusen made it to the final in 2002 but if you look at their squad, they actually had a decent team. Butt, Lucio, Ballack and Berbatov all reached at least one more CL final and won a lot of other things in their careers as well. The main point is that if a team reaches the semi final or final it´s never a fluke.

City also still have the chance to advance as well, Bayern and Napoli still face each other twice.

Hmm, fair enough, I think if we don't face RM/barca or Man utd too early we could get to semi final and with good momentum we could get to the final, remember how many semi finals chelsea have been in since abramovich took over, 4 semi finals in 7 seasons.
I think chelsea have been written off stupidly, just like man united were last season, their team didn't look as good as chelsea's and city's, but they got results.

Thank you. At most they have a gerrard replacement in shelvey, but Reina and carragher there's no one really there to replace them. We made good business buying meireles for 11 million and I have no idea why 'King kenny' benched him over adam and henderson. One mans trash is another mans treasure I guess.
 
 
No Italian team, that's for sure.

I would guess, Barca, Real, Bayern, or Manu.

City have performed too poorly in Europe. Chelsea not quite there and Arsenal no way. No other German team is as good, same for Spain and Portugal. Maybe some smaller team can surprise.

Yeah, Though Bayern have an easy league, if it wasn't so dodgy they would win the bundesliga with ease every season.
Though AC milan did draw to Barcelona so they could still be in it, early days.
I think that chelsea are there, we'll wait till our next big match in the prem since the man united match we matched them but they just got the goals, not much difference in class tbh. We've had better results than man united and we have a harder group for sure, Basel and Benfica aren't as good as leverkusen and valencia where we should have wrapped the game. We're performing better than them yet we're still written off. Chelsea need to win the CL just to prove they're contenders.

The Bundesliga lacks other top teams, but the average team isn´t weaker than the average team in Italy or Spain.

Easy league eh?

No surprise you English are always surprised if your national team do badly even though you have the best league with the best teams, no?
 
 
 
Easy league eh?

No surprise you English are always surprised if your national team do badly even though you have the best league with the best teams, no?

 

Because the best players in our league aren't english, simple as that. Only top players in the league are rooney, cole, gerrard, lampard and terry(who are starting to get on in age besides rooney). Look at the top teams, how many of them have top english talent in the first team who deserve to be there? Not many. Man Utd only have Rooney, young (jones, smalling and welbeck)(who are not the best but they're good for their age). Chelsea's top english players are all 30 or over and the younger players, Man city only have hart, barry and milner are average and you can forget about liverpool because they just bought a bunch of english players, talented sure but world beaters they're long from it besides gerrard.
These are all very good players who are capable of winning things, but compare it to spain and germany, where the national team is basically barcelona and real madrid for spain and bayern munich for germany, not mentioning that chelsea and man city have one or two players of the spanish squad with them.

We have the best league with some of the best teams, but we don't have the best players for england. Theo walcott and stewart downing/young vs iniesta/silva and villa or against ozil/muller and gotze, says it all.
 
 
 
The Bundesliga lacks other top teams, but the average team isn´t weaker than the average team in Italy or Spain.

 

Yes that is true, but I think that leverkusen and bayern are the only consistent teams and bayern are better than leverkusen. Lets be serious if you swapped manchester united for bayern man utd will win practically every season.
 
 
I think undeniably Barca are 1st in the world, and I really think Real Madrid are a fair bit better than United. Any two of those 3 in the final (obviously we don't know draws).

That´s true, but Utd have been fighting chelsea as their only real competitors for quite a while as well. But England is an exception because there are more than 2 top teams. It´s true that many teams in the Bundesliga are inconsistant but it´s harder for clubs to keep their top players because there are stricter regulations regarding financial help from investors. Clubs like Chelsea, City, PSG or Malaga couldn´t exist there.

Yeah its true, but well Chelsea are better than leverkusen and if man united have been facing them as competition, then there's no competition for them then.
To be fair leverkusen have a pretty good team, ballack, derdiyok, augusto, adler, kiesling. Top teams would love to buy these players but they're just not as good as the big boys. I think it's the name that's what makes a team so good to be honest, because man united could probably have leverkusens players in their team and probably win trophies with it, seeing as they won last season with a 'mediocre' united team, no ronaldo or tevez, valencia and hernandez aren't as good as them yet they still won the league.
 
 
Ill go for the obvious 3 options of ;

Barcelona
Real Madrid
Manu
 
 
If Barca get eliminated, its any1s for da taking. The obvious favourties will be Bayern, United, Real or Milan
 
 
The argument that Liverpool spent £35 million on Carrol and '£20' million on Henderson is just bull**** mate. But you can carry on spouting it if it makes you feel better.

We'd just gotten £50 million for Torres, we needed a striker, he'd been doing really good.

Henderson was NOT £20 million. He was 16 at the very most. More likely 10-13.
 
 
As Milan drew with Barca and scored 2 away goals, I think there's a decentish chance Barca might come second in the group. Which would be fantastic for the competition.

That will be funny, because barca could face arsenal again in the second round, despite the fact they were raped by barca, they were pretty close to beating them.
 
 
 
As Milan drew with Barca and scored 2 away goals, I think there's a decentish chance Barca might come second in the group. Which would be fantastic for the competition.

 

It also shows proof that Barca are not that invincible - looking at their squad roster it is not as deep as it should be. I don't think they have any out-and-out strikers other than David Villa, so if something like injury or suspension happens to him they have a bit of a problem. Likewise they don't seem to have that much back-up in defence, sure that defensive midfielders like Mascherano and Busquets and Keita can deputise there but they are not always 100% comfortable there.

I am very sure it will not be Barca this year but I would hate to see Bayern win as they were so lucky to even qualify for the competition this year, I utterly hate seeing teams that win the Champ League having only narrowly qualified from the previous year like Liverpool in 05 or Milan in 07.

I see no reason why Dortmund cannot be considered a dark horse, as long as they win the next two games and get the campaign back on track.
 
 
Dortmund are a dark horse, but I think for them to win the CL they need sahin, who they no longer have, sure they have gotze and other players but sahin is just class!!
Barca last year was like inter the year before, they had pretty much no challenge in the competition except for arsenal of all teams like inter had the challenge of barcelona. I didn't know how good milan really were, but they have a great squad and I would hate to face them before the quarters/semis.
Man city will not fail to disappoint and teams aren't really scared of them, I think they can only realistically win the league anyway which they probably won't do. I'm just waiting for man city to get spanked again though, mancini is crap at champions league, just because there's a bit of money at city doesn't make him any better, it's not like inter were crap anyway.
 
 
Oh, so basically, now what i've said just above is looking much more likely.
Who said Man City will get to the semis?
 
 
 
Liverpool spent £35 million on Andy Carroll and £20 million on Jordan Henderson, yet sold Raul Meireles. As the poster who quoted you has said, we have Bertrand, McEachran, Lukaku, Luiz, Sturridge and Romeu all under twenty-three, so there you go. In the same vein, who do Liverpool have to replace Gerrard? Reina? Carragher?

 

All they have is a replacement for gerrard in shelvey, the rest however, they don't have any and have to buy more players.
 
 
Obviously, the big teams will all have a shout i.e your Madrid's, Chelsea's etc but I think Napoli could be the underdog of the competition along with Arsenal.

I won't even call arsenal an underdog now, they're a good team in great form atm, they are being saved by 2 players in the goalie and van persie but walcott has been on form since he destroyed cole. Wouldn't call them a dark horse, though they can do a liverpool very easily and I wouldn't be surprised if they did.

Do you think? Cause as good as Arsenal are playing there still not at the level of Barca, Real etc I don't think, so I would say the underdog term would probably be best way to sum up there chances. I agree with you about RVP and Szczesny both have been instrumental in getting Arsenal back up the table.  
 
 
Potentially a double Real/Barca vs. Man Utd/City next round fixture.

I think they're under a great manager (as much as I hate wenger's stubbornness it's true) and that helps quite a bit. Under a class manager, the most average of players can beat world beaters, look at man united last season, they got to the CL final and beat chelsea, who had better players than them, but ferguson got them to force out their results, got the momentum going and got players like carrick/anderson/valencia and others in a team of superstars, remember that these players were constantly being compared to ronaldo/tevez and scholes and I think none of them are at their level, but they played well and the top class players won the games for them like rooney/hernandez/berbatov/vidic and VDS.

Arsenal could have won the league last season if it wasn't for that crash since that carling cup final(which had to be the funniest moment in my life)
 
 
Bayern vs Napoli.

Watch this space.
 
 
 
Potentially a double Real/Barca vs. Man Utd/City next round fixture.

 

Oh, didn't realise that barca are going to the europa league.
provided bayern tries and villareal cave in due to their injury problems, city don't have a chance in hell of qualifying.

No denying Wenger is a top class manager. And I have to concede, I to felt that Arsenal could of won the title last season, until the Carling cup horror show. But, I would still stick my neck out and say that they are the underdogs of the competition.

Bayern have the group wrapped up so there isn't much at stake for them unless they forsee city as a genuine contender should they progress for the title and thus seek to knock them out.

Villareal are staying 4th no matter what, there's nothing at stake for them, so napoli win, city win, they're still out.

Bit late.

But, we have bags of young talent. Robinson, Flanagan, Henderson, Kelly, Carroll, Coates. Even throw in Spearing, not mentioning the likes of Sterling, Morgan, Suso, Adorjan who haven't made it all the way to the 1st team yet, but look like quality prospects. Suarez is only 24, Enrique is 25, Agger 26, Adam 25, Lucas 24, Skrtel 27, Johnson 27, Downing 27. Reina is 29, can have up to another 7/8 years with us barring a transfer. The core of our team are all approaching their respective peaks.

And neither Gerrard nor Carra were playing when we beat you at the weekend. I think our squad is a lot better set up for the future than yours.

You guys are finishing your transition period to be fair. Although chelsea could start with a lot of the players we have now, but serously, can a winger like downing play till 35?
I could say the same about chelsea, we have talent like llakovic, kakuta nathan chalobah(captain of u17 england team), lucas piazon, romeu(who we can't rush into the first team or barcelona will buy him back) and the people I said before. Then the likes of cech(29 and we have 2 replacements for him), bosingwa(28), luiz(24), ivanovic(27), alex(29), meireles(28), mikel(24), sturridge(22), mata(23) and torres(27). Don't need a transfer either, just for the young ones to step up. By checking the average age, our squad is the same age in fact slightly younger than yours.

Be realistic tbh. Cech hasn't been the same since his head thing. And he is clearly still fazed by it, as shown by the addition of yet more protection. Bosingwa isn't the best. Luiz is actually pretty crap, as shown at the weekend. Ivanovic, meh. Alex, meh, nothing special, Meireles, good player. Mikel, lol. Constantly poor, easiest 16mil united ever made. Sturridge and Mata are very good. Torres might be if he stopped thinking about liverpool. All in all, you wrote a long list, and tbh only 3 of them are top quality.

You're pretty arrogant, luiz had a good game last weekend, none of the goals were his fault, terry was more at fault than he was but because he's english he won't get the criticism and luiz will get it.

The reason why he's wearing more protection is because he broke his bloody nose against blackburn, same reason steven taylor wears the mask and it's not permanent.

United didn't even have mikel, he switched to chelsea before he joined united. Mikel isn't constantly poor, the way he plays is important. Ivanovic was the second best right back last season so he's not meh.

Alex is a good player, not the best in the world, but then him, terry and luiz were in a defence that only shipped 27 goals the whole of last season so he can't be 'nothing special'. Have you watched chelsea play? Or just listened to the media?

You've forgot about bosingwa's performances in the first couple of games this season, he was the best right back at the time, he shows that form again, he can be the best right back in the league, better than even richards and walker, he's 28 and will show that form over time.

As for sturridge, until sunday he wasn't performing too well either.

How the hell is torres still thinking about liverpool, have you got any sort of evidence for that? You just pulled that out of your arse.

Finally, we have two replacements for cech, thibaut courtouis and matej delac. in 2 seasons, they can push for a first team place at chelsea.

I think Villas Boas, if allowed to stay, will get rid of a lot of players and mould the team into his own shape and style. I think this'll mean a lot of your senior players will be leaving.

Finally! That's completely spot on not just for Terry but for English players in general. They're all over hyped, you pay over the odds for players just because there English take Stewart Downing for example. In the region of 20 million, absolutely ridiculous he's a £12 million man at best (note I am aware there were other reasons why his fee was so high but I genuinely believe him being English added quite a bit of value). #Rantover  
 
 
 
Man Utd vs Man City.

 

Europa League final more like  
 
 
 
Potentially a double Real/Barca vs. Man Utd/City next round fixture.

 

teams from the same country can't face eachother in the next round  
 
 
 
Europa League final more like  

 

  icing on the cake(as an arsenal fan   )

True, the contract situation made him about 15 million, the 5 million on top was because he was english.
 
 
 
Europa League final more like  

 

That's class.
Funnily enough that they're doing poorly in the CL and great in the PL while chelsea and arsenal are the exact opposite. Although Ferguson is just gonna put on his best team for the final match and win it while there's really nothing mancini can do besides beat bayern and hope villareal put on a show.
 
 
 
I think Villas Boas, if allowed to stay, will get rid of a lot of players and mould the team into his own shape and style. I think this'll mean a lot of your senior players will be leaving.

 

Ok, so he said he was gonna buy a right back, then he said he was satisfied with bosingwa after his good form at the start of the season, so he is in his plans.

Only senior/rotation first team player under 30 i really see leaving is alex. AVB said he was satisfied with mikel for a reason, because he's using him till essien comes back, but he isn't gonna sell him.

Kalou is a backup player so doesn't count and AVB wants to give him a contract so he doesn't lose him on a free.

He bought meireles and mata, bought lukaku, he'll use mceachran over time, he has faith in torres, all the under 30 players besides maybe alex are safe and even then chelsea didn't want him to go to juventus.
 
 
Anyway, my bet for champions league final, is bayern/real madrid vs chelsea/arsenal.
 
 
Real Madrid and Barcelona.

Barcelona just because they're 'TEH BES TEAM IN TH WOORLD!!!!!!!1'
 
 
It just depends how the draw goes really. If you asked who the best two teams were then I'd say Real and Barca, whether they'll both get there or not, idk. I also think Bayern are pretty impressive, so them if either of the first two don't get there.
 
 
 
6 possible teams and 3 dark horses. In order of most likely:
Biggest loss is Essien which may prove to be crucial as he's imo the best overall midfielder in the PL as their is no area he's weak in.)

 

 

No
 
 
I'm gonna go for arsenal vs real madrid now. Arsenal are looking invincible despite their defence(they have van persie) and if they faced man united now, they would get a draw at least and I can see them beating city. Though chelsea have a chance and can pull off the liverpool while Inter are getting back to their best.
Maybe APOEL might win it lol. If I put a £10 bet on that, I would be rich if they did.
 
 
United have always made the Champions League final every season they have been undefeated at the group stages (99,08,09,11). This season they need to avoid defeat in the last group game to qualify, so if they do avoid defeat...
 
 
barca and man u again probs
 
 
Yet more Barca v Man U predictions from the dipsticks who know f all about the game.

I can say with absolute certainty that Arsenal won't be in the CL final.
 
 
Barcelona vs Manchester United III

I expect us to get past Basel and then go on a run like we have done in recent years. Anyone writing us off should remember United have been perenially awful in the group stages for a long time now but reached 3 finals in 4 years by effectively doing just enough. We scrape through the groups, then tend to play defensively strong football that undoes teams over two legs. It's become the Ferguson way and it works. Of course once we get there we inevitably get taken apart by Barcelona but who doesn't? They're so far ahead of every other side in the world.

Then again, we'll finish 2nd in our group so we could end up meeting them in the last 16. It's so hard to predict the final when the draw is random each round but I've said since the start that if the draw keeps the two sides apart they'll meet in Munich. I'm sticking by that.

The thing is, that barcelona might not do enough, they'll get lucky to get to semis, if they face bayern/RM/AC/inter, they will lose, inter are pretty much invincible, AC's attack is pretty good and might be enough to counter messi, inter sorted them out 2 years ago with that typical mourinho win. Man united won't face barca in the final, at most 1 of them will be in the final, and man united got in the final by the easy run, they faced a demoralised chelsea team that had been weak in the 2nd half of the season, if they faced them earlier in the season when we were winning 6-0 they could have lost easily to us.
Man united wouldn't have beaten a full strength Bayern team or a full strength real madrid team last season.

Did you play defensively since chelsea and schalke last season? that's a lie, you dominated both of us, and if it wasn't for manuel neuer, schalke would have lost 10-2 on aggregate. You were good, but chelsea were poor, our best player in the match got a red(ramires) so we basically had no chance of winning.
Barcelona are overrated, lets be serious, xavi and iniesta aren't that good, they can be negated by good enough DM's, essien, terry, ivanovic, Cambiasso, lucio and samuel did a good job against them. why can't the likes of bayern witth gustavo, bastuber and van buyten be unable to handle them?
Still say arsenal/real madrid vs chelsea final, no bias at all, both teams are good enough to get there, so you can't count them out.
 
 
 
Man united wouldn't have beaten a full strength Bayern team or a full strength real madrid team last season.

 

What? The year before United were ragging Bayern until Rafeal got sent off stupidly, how do you conclude that?
 
 
 
What? The year before United were ragging Bayern until Rafeal got sent off stupidly, how do you conclude that?

 

Because they have a better defence than before, that's why, they shouldn't have sold hummels, that was the stupidest decision they ever made. But boateng and badstuber have sorted out the defence.
I'm sure you lost the first leg too?
 
 
Man utd all the way!! C'mon on being it on all u hated
 
 
Barchaaaaaaaaaaa..i love :-* the real one..messi the awesome young boy ;-)
 
 
 
Man utd all the way!! C'mon on being it on all u hated

 

what?
 
 
I would LOL hard if the epic,legendary,world-beating and record-breaking(and overrated) EPL teams like Man City,Chelsea and Man United all end up in the Europa league.

right now top 3 favourites are: Barca,Bayern Munich and Mardrid.

Yes they won their home leg 2-1 and were losing 3-0 at Old Trafford I believe.
 
 
 
 

No

 

Would you care to elaborate on No please. Tell me a midfielder who's as good as going forward as he is defending at such a high level in the PL. Can't wait to hear this one, you'll probably tell me Milner is better haha

Essien didn't have his best season last season tbf, but eitherway. You're right, milner is basically a dirk kuyt that can play in more positions, park ji sung is as good as milner tbh, he pretty much single handedly kept man united in the tie against barcelona in the CL final

Essien of 06-08ish was, but he's a shadow of his former self. And Yaya Toure to answer your question.
 
 
 
What? The year before United were ragging Bayern until Rafeal got sent off stupidly, how do you conclude that?

 

Did it never oocur to you that teams improve?

Bayern have a better defence now that is only going to improve, and they already have one of the best midfields in the world. Combine that with Gomez improving drastically since that season and Bayern are a much better outfit now.

Its also arguable that United havent really improved at all since then yet Bayern beat them anyway.

Fair, didn't know about the broken nose, but you can't argue that he is the same player as pre steven hunt. When I found out how young he was back then I nearly ****ing fell over, what an epic goalie. Now I think he always has a mistake in him, nowhere near the same confidence, as shown by wearing his helmet. Fair play, I probably would if I had fractured my skull, but it is a sign he isn't completely at ease, and will probably pull out of challenges etc. But fair, he has a reason.
Luiz. Every time I see him he is just a freaking maniac. Showed as soon as you signed him, great defender, but just mental. And makes stupid challenges. Will see how he improves.
Mikel never signed for united.  oh wait.....  Come on. He is never going to be claude makele. Plays the odd good game, he is your Anderson. But united fans all know anderson is generally ****.
Alex I rarely see play, but as he played only 19 games last season, thats probably why. Not your first choice CB, but fair, he is ok. The original list I have a feeling was saying these players were amazing though.
Bosingwa. Being 28 isn't an indicator of form. And playing well for a few games doesn't make you good. Used to be good, now he barely ever plays does he. I'm sure Ivanovic is always RB for you lot. Which says a lot tbh.
Sturridge I was basing on his ability as shown at bolton. He is young, so you can do that.

Torres was talking about how he was forced out of liverpool  only the other day.  A player thats says he was forced out of another club nearly a year on obviously still has an attachment to that club.

Alex I rarely see play, but as he played only 19 games last season, thats probably why. Not your first choice CB, but fair, he is ok. The original list I have a feeling was saying these players were amazing though.
Bosingwa. Being 28 isn't an indicator of form. And playing well for a few games doesn't make you good. Used to be good, now he barely ever plays does he. I'm sure Ivanovic is always RB for you lot. Which says a lot tbh.
Sturridge I was basing on his ability as shown at bolton. He is young, so you can do that.

Torres was talking about how he was forced out of liverpool  only the other day.  A player thats says he was forced out of another club nearly a year on obviously still has an attachment to that club.

Worst wum ever.  

 

I meant that they aren't that good, as in invincible, not as in they're not good.
Also, with torres, do you really believe the metro?
Thirdly, Cech wears the helmet, because he's a triplet, so he has a weaker skull, if he plays without it and gets hit again, it'll end his career. That's why he wears his helmet, did you see how he broke his nose against blackburn, that was courage, if he was so scared why would he risk his head and break his nose in order to get the ball?
Cech was chelsea's best player last season, was second for the golden glove and conceded the least amount of goals with man city too. He's just had a poor run of form atm. Ok, his first season was amazing since he only conceded 15 goals, but that's also because of mourinho's negative tactics to prevent scoring freely, when did you ever see chelsea win 6-0 with mourinho, he went straight for 1-0 victories.
Ok, yes mikel is anderson for us and won't be the next makalele, but he is 24, he'll get better in time, he'll become good in time, he needs to get used to positive tactics and increasing the tempo some more with our style of play.
 
 
 
 

So 3 players have stopped them once in 3 years and theyre over-rated?  

 

Sorry, meant they aren't that good, they're not godlike that's what I meant. They're great players, but there are people as good as them, guti in his prime was as good as them or even better, scholes was as good as them, they based their gameplay on scholes, that shows how good he really is.

Well they arent exactly going to come out and say they think they're the best are they?

Guti was nowhere near as good as Xavi or Iniesta are.

He was inconsistent, his work rate was quite poor and his footwork wasnt that great. He was a good passer and thats about it really. (Not saying he was bad, just overrated IMO).
 
 
Barcelona and Bayern Munich me thinks
 
 
To answer the question, it depends on the draw.

Right now, the favourites would be Barca, Madrid and Bayern.

However, if Man Utd, Chelsea and Milan do finish 2nd in their groups, then who knows what'll happen - for example a Chelsea - Madrid Last 16 tie, maybe Chelsea might win?

That's the beauty of the CL, who knew that APOEL would get into the Last 16 with Zenit, Porto & Shaktar in the group - all who have recently won the Europa League as well.
 
 
Marseille-Arsenal  
 
 
 
Barcelona vs Manchester United III

 

Oh. Dear. God. Yet another go-with-the-flow sheep just trying to go for the "safe" option. If Man U are drawn against Barca in the last 16 or the quarters, the likes of you will have serious egg on your face. Absolutely no way does lightning strike thrice.

Either it will be Real against Barca or either Real or Barca against one of the unexpected dark horses - could be the Gooners or someone like Zenit or Ajax or Lille if luck of the draw favours them. THAT is more like the views of someone who actually has followed football far more years than the average lemming sheep on here.

Seriously, man united was a dark horse to get to the final, had an easy run, faced an under par chelsea team and faced marseille and schalke, as soon as they beat chelsea, they were guaranteed finalists, if inter had gone through rather than losing to schalke, it could have been a different story.
Real madrid would have beat man united last season, lets see who goes through and look at the draw.
 
 
Bayern Munich vs. Barca

*should point out I am a Bayern fan so may be slightly biased

They've sorted themselves out finally... and if they get to the final at home, it'll be hard to stop them.
You never know Madrid or Chelsea could be there.

Inter lost 5-2 to Schalke at home. It wasn't even close ffs.

Now, based on the fact they will probably meet earlier, think it won't be Madrid Barca. Going for Madrid AC

But, lets be serious, chelsea would have battered schalke, arsenal would have battered schalke, the italian giants underperform in the champions league because they underestimate the other teams, they underestimated tottenham, got battered by one player. AC underestimated tottenham, tottenham got a goal and it saw tottenham through. Then when the italian giants face a top team, they get battered, united vs AC for example.

Only exception to this is mourinho's inter(and that's because it's mourinho, no other reason why they won)

Also, has this now shut up the bandwagoners saying man u barca or city barca?
Chelsea/madrid/arsenal/barca/bayern are now the favourites.
Also, to those saying city had a hard group and that's why they went out, they also lost to chelsea yesterday and with their 'top quality' team should have got through the stages.
 
 
This is Chelsea's year.
 
 
Madrid or Barca will be in the final. Doubt both will make it.

No idea who the other team will be though. Bayern, Chelsea or Milan for me. Can't see Arsenal surviving the quarter finals (wouldn't be against them getting to the final though).

And as to the person who said "Italian giants underpreform..." Did you watch both games against Barca this season? They gave them one hell of a run for their money, and got a draw at the Camp Nou! AC were in a transitional phase last season, I was not surprised to see them bow out of Europe to a rampant Tottenham. Tottenham are a brilliant side.
 
 
I think the draw for the knock-out round is on Friday.
 
 
Arsenal v Barca, rematch of 2005

Henry to come back to Arsenal in January and score a hat trick to shock Messi & Co, and then RVP will knock in another hat trick for fun.
 
 
 
I think the draw for the knock-out round is on Friday.

 

It is indeed. And the Europa League  
 
 
 
It is indeed. And the Europa League  

 

Does the draw essentially set out the route to the final or do they do another draw later on?

CL does round of 16 on friday. Then sets out the finals.

Cassano is out, he's like the missing link that breaks the lock, they may struggle unless they get a new striker. You just called tottenham a brilliant side, a side that couldn't score 1 goal against real madrid in the CL ok then.
Then again, yes milan have been rebuilding and have been rebuilt, inter have been rebuilding too, great teams overall tbf, but I still see them underperforming. But that's just me. But they've been known to do that in the past.
 
 
  at those people who were saying another Man united vs Barcelona final haha
 
 
 
I bet most of the same people saying "Utd-Barca" final are probably some of the same sheep-like ignoramuses who back in 2006 said things like "OMFG, Brazil are the best, Ronaldinho is just too good and will win the World Cup easily and no-one else stands a chance". Please, do us a favour and talk about some topics you may know something about because it sure hell isn't football.  

 

I guess last week shut everyone up.
Chelsea in with a chance this season.
 
 
i think madrid barca final and I'm hoping they don't get drawn against each other earlier
 
 
It will be an El Clasico final, how amazing would that be? No matter what, i'd watch it  .
 
 
im 100% sure madrid and barca will get each other along the road there so i dont think it will be them

i personally hope its ac milan vs bayern munich a fair final that either team could win but unfortunately i doubr that will be the final :/
 
 
 
  at those people who were saying another Man united vs Barcelona final haha

 

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAH. Man-U in the final? Man City? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.

All those jokers saying oh, Man city and Man U in the final lol.
 
 
Love to see Arsenal make it again, Wenger deserves to win the CL, and should have in 2006.
 
 
 
I guess last week shut everyone up.

First point, I give you kudos for.

Second point, not so to be honest.  

From a neutral POV, a Real-Barca final would be interesting and I know some purists want it, but depending on the draw tomorrow no reason why a dark horse cannot get to the final.

Personally, would love a "David and Goliath" type encounter, say Real or Barca against Zenit or even Napoli!!  
 
 
 
Love to see Arsenal make it again, Wenger deserves to win the CL, and should have in 2006.

 

Yeah man, totally agree.
 
 
Yeah as a neutral to all the teams in it this year, I'm rooting for Arsenal  
 
 
 
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAH. Man-U in the final? Man City? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.

All those jokers saying oh, Man city and Man U in the final lol.

 

Jokers? There probably right. They'll get into the final.

...Of the Europa League  
 
 
Barca V Madrid Final top 2 teams...
 
 
Chelsea vs Real Madrid
 
 
 
Yeah man, totally agree.

 

So do chelsea, the amount of semi finals and finals we've been too, 2 with controversial knockouts and one being as close to winning the competition as possible, WHY THE **** DID TERRY HAVE TO SLIP?
 
 
Chelsea vs madrid/inter.
 
 
 
Love to see Arsenal make it again, Wenger deserves to win the CL, and should have in 2006.

 

Why the hell does he deserve it?!

They were outplayed by Barcelona in 2006 and got what they deserved.

I'll ask you the same - Why do Chelsea deserve it?!

 

2 out of the 4 semi finals we've been to and lost in the past 10 years have been controversial decisions.
We went to a final, played well and matched united, could have gone either way, we were a penalty away from winning the champions league.

That's why.

So? That's like saying Ajax were +1 goal difference away from winning the Eredivisie in 06-07, doesn't mean they deserve it. Its their fault for not scoring more, just like its Chelsea's fault for not picking a better penalty taker.

Whoever wins it, deserves it.
 
 
 
Yeah as a neutral to all the teams in it this year, I'm rooting for Arsenal  

 

my heart is warmed by neutrals that wish to see Arsenal do well in Europe.

I'm glad Man City are out because they're a disgrace to the Premiership and I'm ashamed to have them represent it.
 
 
 
Why the hell does he deserve it?!

They were outplayed by Barcelona in 2006 and got what they deserved.

 

I don't think they were outplayed really, Barcelona weren't that great that night. Larsson really made all the difference, but Barcelona's goals were still a bit scrappy. That and the fact that Lehman, being the knob he is, got sent off, meaning they had to take Pires off (not a great thing to have to do against a team with such a great midfield as Barca's). It was at this point that Barcelona really began to put pressure on Arsenal, but of course they would, when Arsenal only had 10 men on the field. So all in all, I would say Arsenal were unlucky because their chances were dashed by one man's moment of stupidity.

Why does he deserve it? Because a) the above represents some serious bad luck in a CL final, things he could do nothing about b) he's created 2 or 3 great teams that should really have done better for him in the CL, but still played some great football c) he has always played football with the right attitude, with a desire to entertain, something which is lost on the modern generation to some degree d) He's one of the best man-managers in the game, and has helped many great players to reach their full potential, and has done so whilst working with limited funds, buying and selling players to balance the books, making players more than buying them.

Indeed, it seems very strange to me that people will say 'Well, Barca deserve to win the CL, they play good football in the right spirit', especially considering that Barca are blessed with having had some of the most talented players of their generation all come through at the same time (not saying that's nothing to do with scouting/coaching, but there is still an element of luck in that they all appeared at roughly the same time), and yet they will say Arsenal don't deserve to win the CL. Arsene Wenger is one of the best managers in the world, has given more to the game than most ever will, so that is why, in short, I think he deserves to win the ultimate club competition.

LOL, sorry but you can't say Barcelona deserved to win their semi-final against Chelsea, they had one shot on target and Chelsea should have had about 9 penalties. Never has a team been so favoured by FIFA.

What about Chelsea? They bought the title too. Everybody seems to have forgotten about that.

Please don't get me started.
Chelsea were in the top 4 and got a billionaire in. We're basically tottenham with money.
City were mid table and were unlikely to progress further than midtable.
It's basically like saying if liverpool win the title they bought it, because they have new rich owners.

Completely different situation. Unless you're telling me that getting players like henderson, downing, coates and spending 60 million on players is buying the title. Oh wait, so spending around 60 million on players like jones, young and whoever else they bought this season isn't buying the title?
Chelsea didn't have 3 first teams like city have now either.

Whoopedy doo, we have a new owner who's rich, he helped us win the title, but we were going to get to that stage with the players we had, i'm guessing, lampard, terry, cudicini, hasselbaink, zola, gudjohnssen, leboeuf, desailly, petrescu, babayaro were bought with abramovichs money then? All quality players good enough to win the league, all played around the same time and two of them were vital in us winning the title, it's a shame that zola never won a premier league title with us, he was definitely good enough, would love him to be in our team now at his prime.

That is true, same thing with the arsenal match against barca, as soon as RVP got sent off (wrongfully) you had no chance. Arsenal and Chelsea have deserved it, I would say chelsea more so but I am biased.

All london final would be the best though. I could see it happening, if arsenal get madrid and chelsea get barca (if they all get to quarter finals) then it could happen, if it was the other way round, then chelsea and arsenal will both get knocked out.
 
 
 
my heart is warmed by neutrals that wish to see Arsenal do well in Europe.

I'm glad Man City are out because they're a disgrace to the Premiership and I'm ashamed to have them represent it.

 

If chelsea get knocked out, I will actually root for arsenal (I have never said this before). Although it took years for wenger to sort out his defensive problems and had weakened his midfield severely on paper, but they're doing much better than we all expected and it's not down to luck, every player has just lived up to their potential this season.

Yes, but you bought the title.

Villa have won the title more times than Chelsea and we never bought it. Your club is just another toy to a forgein billionaire.

Didn't reply to a single point I made.
Oh ok, so you used your youth squad and got them into the first team to win the title then?
Villa could have got to tottenhams stage as well, all they had to do was keep milner, young and downing and have bought bent sooner.

I didn't need to respond to everything you said.

You bought the title.

Liverpool, who you mentioned on this seasons transfers, will win **** all.

UTD will win **** all this season too. Maybe not for another season or two and that will cripple the club (fingers crossed). Personally I believe it is City and Spurs who will be going at it now, providing Spurs get into the CL this season they will go from strength to strength.

It will be nice to see the paradigm shift in English football.

And yeah, we always do well with bringing our youth team through.

On the subject of we could have been there, MON wasted a couple of transfers, Sidwell, Coker, Heskey, Beye, Shorey. If he hadn't given them huge wages Lerner may have offered MON a little bit more money to spend but he was fed up with spending the same as Man City and not getting anywhere.
 
 
 
What about Chelsea? They bought the title too. Everybody seems to have forgotten about that.

 

oh no, I agree wholeheartedly, I only didn't mention them because they are not knocked out yet so it wasn't really relevant.
to elaborate, Barcelona and Real are, imo, the same because they've bought a fair part of their glory too. but not everyone can manage the finances and keep the club afloat like Arsene Wenger  .

Ok, you really think that spurs are going to get far and do better than chelsea and united?
That's the funniest thing i've heard all day. MON did waste some money, but he got you 6th place, Houllier almost got you relegated until the last 8 or so games when he wasn't even the manager at the time with his illness.
You could have been there, not my fault villa are a selling club, sell downing, get n'zogbia, sell young, use agblonlahor on the left(he is doing well to be fair but you could put him up front) sell milner, get ireland. Next second you're gonna sell bannan, delph and albrighton. Tottenham just kept their players.

Also, the chelsea and united comments are a complete joke. This has got to be sour grapes that your team can't keep their players. You really think united will fall if they don't win for a few seasons? So if you can go back to 2004-06, that was their worst era, they came back from it and won 3 titles in a row. Chelsea weren't winning things in 07-09 besides the odd fa cup. Did abramovich leave and our club go into financial turmoil, no it didn't. You would have written us off for the city match, but we won and dominated them for nearly an hour.  
 
 
Manchester united

lol jk

The list of clubs who have used money to get titles or do well in the league, not in the man city sense.
:chelsea, united, newcastle, inter, juventus, roma, lazio, madrid, AC milan, bayern munich, liverpool, leeds, tottenham, barcelona, porto, benfica. Basically every single major team that does well or has done well in the champions league besides arsenal and valencia, who are known for wheeler dealing and giving their youngsters a chance to step up.

Yes MON wasted money on average players who never got a game, we would have been better putting out youth team through. I am going to add Zat Knight and Curtis Davis to the list of poor players; he also sold Cahill.
It's not sour grapes at all, I know we are not even a glimmer of our team pre 1996.

UTD are struggling player wise and their finances will be taking a hit now they are out of the CL which could screw them over. Like I said, fingers crossed.

Abramovich won't just leave because it is his toy. He is spoilt and wants to see it do well, that is why he continues to pump money into it to create stability, but that continous money driving it will not allow gelling. I didn't write you off for the City game, I thought you were going to get a draw. I only saw the last thirty minutes of it and I quite like the look of Ramou (sp).
 
 
 
Well, you're not bitter at all.

Bless.

 

He doesn't know what he's talking about. Unless you're arsene wenger or unai emery, you really can't complain about money problems. Look how tight their budget is and the sides they have to compete with.
 
 
 
UTD are struggling player wise and their finances will be taking a hit now they are out of the CL which could screw them over. Like I said, fingers crossed.

 

Yeah, we signed a deal with DHL for sponsorship on our training kits. We'll be ok.

UTD are struggling player wise and their finances will be taking a hit now they are out of the CL which could screw them over. Like I said, fingers crossed.

Abramovich won't just leave because it is his toy. He is spoilt and wants to see it do well, that is why he continues to pump money into it to create stability, but that continous money driving it will not allow gelling. I didn't write you off for the City game, I thought you were going to get a draw. I only saw the last thirty minutes of it and I quite like the look of Ramou (sp).

 

Romeu was bought for 4.5 million and was not going to get a look into that barca team, not really big spending, for a player who's already our best defensive midfielder at 19.
United won't mess up, never ever write united off, it's the one thing you should never do, as long as ferguson is in charge, they're never getting out of the top 4.
 
 
Real and Chelsea.

I have the sneakiest feeling Barca will go out before even the semi final. They seem to only win it all every other year.

I honestly think my Gunners have it in them to go all the way but I'm just too wary of losing earlier most years.

I'm calling it now: Arsenal beat Barca in the quarters then go out to Real.
 
 
Barcelona = definitely

Real Madrid = most likely
Inter Milan = maybe
AC Milan = maybe
Bayern Munich = maybe

So I will say Barcelona vs (Real Madrid or Inter Milan or AC Milan or Bayern Munchen)
 
 
 
2 out of the 4 semi finals we've been to and lost in the past 10 years have been controversial decisions.
We went to a final, played well and matched united, could have gone either way, we were a penalty away from winning the champions league.

That's why.

 

Just remind me how much money your team spent on this?
 
 
 
I don't think they were outplayed really, Barcelona weren't that great that night. Larsson really made all the difference, but Barcelona's goals were still a bit scrappy. That and the fact that Lehman, being the knob he is, got sent off, meaning they had to take Pires off (not a great thing to have to do against a team with such a great midfield as Barca's). It was at this point that Barcelona really began to put pressure on Arsenal, but of course they would, when Arsenal only had 10 men on the field. So all in all, I would say Arsenal were unlucky because their chances were dashed by one man's moment of stupidity.

 

That's football. I can't recall the sending off, but he was obviously under pressure, otherwise he'd have kept his cool - pressure from Barcelona.

And...AND...Just reading Wikipedia, "  Lehmann  had an outstanding 2005–06 season with Arsenal, making his 100th Premier League appearance for the club in their game against West Bromwich Albion on 15 April 2006. He was a key factor in his side's first-ever accession to the Champions League final; during their run Arsenal broke the record for the most consecutive clean sheets in the Champions League with ten, breaking the record of seven that Milan had set just one year before. That run formed the bulk of an 853-minute spell without conceding a goal, overtaking the CL record for an individual goalkeeper set by Edwin van der Sar."

I bet you weren't complaining about him then, were you?

 
Why does he deserve it? Because a) the above represents some serious bad luck in a CL final, things he could do nothing about

 

So he's never had any good fortune, then? You get some good luck, you get some bad.

 
b) he's created 2 or 3 great teams that should really have done better for him in the CL, but still played some great football

 

His job isn't just to build the team, though. As manager it's his job to get them to play well.

 
c) he has always played football with the right attitude, with a desire to entertain, something which is lost on the modern generation to some degree

 

I don't disagree, but you're implying that beautiful football and success are mutually exclusive.

 
d) He's one of the best man-managers in the game, and has helped many great players to reach their full potential, and has done so whilst working with limited funds, buying and selling players to balance the books, making players more than buying them.

 

This is just an opinion - if he really made players reach their full potential, they'd have won something in the last  6 years , wouldn't they?

Everyone always gets on about money with Arsenal - how much money did Porto spend when they won the CL? (I know that's a selected example, but a great manager managed to win something with, comparatively, very little, so it is possible)

 
Indeed, it seems very strange to me that people will say 'Well, Barca deserve to win the CL, they play good football in the right spirit', especially considering that Barca are blessed with having had some of the most talented players of their generation all come through at the same time (not saying that's nothing to do with scouting/coaching, but there is still an element of luck in that they all appeared at roughly the same time), and yet they will say Arsenal don't deserve to win the CL. Arsene Wenger is one of the best managers in the world, has given more to the game than most ever will, so that is why, in short, I think he deserves to win the ultimate club competition.

 

I do wonder what Barcelona will be like when the golden generation are past it...maybe they'll have some more coming through?

But I'll add that Arsenal only signed Fabregas because Spanish law doesn't allow 16 year olds to sign professional footballing contracts, so he couldn't join Barca and thus moved to North London.
 
 
 
Just remind me how much money your team spent on this?

 

Oh ok then, remind me how much money madrid have spent on the champions league and reaching their first semi final in 6 years?
Barcelona: zlatan ibrahimovic, that is all.
Man united: so 30 million on rooney, 20 something million on ferdinand, 20 million for carrick, 30 million for berbatov. But I guess united don't spend money.
Unless you're arsenal or valencia (who don't even properly challenge for major honours wonder why) you can't complain about spending money.
Leeds united.
Inter milan: financial problems led eto'o and almost led sneijder to leave and they spent loads on players too.

So yeah go on.

who do you support?
Villa cost Barca £35m too.
 
 
Of course APOEL!!! i am kidding,

definetely barcelona

Sanchez and fabregas(got to be the easiest money arsenal have ever made even though he could have been sold for double the price)
I support Chelsea.

LOL, sorry but you can't say Barcelona deserved to win their semi-final against Chelsea, they had one shot on target and Chelsea should have had about 9 penalties. Never has a team been so favoured by FIFA.

 

Only 2 of them were clear cut penalties (the 2 handballs, and how many times do you see a handball not given for ball to hand? Dozens of times every saturday), and the ref more than likely had his sight blocked for them.

And its UEFA dumbass.

Either way, we had 2 clear cut penalties end of, also, in an important match like that it was a shocker, two handballs, the defender had his arm up, how can you not say it wasn't a penalty?
Bloody hell man. I'm guessing you also agree that van persie should have been sent off too? Ok then.

Oh, only two of them were clear-cut, that's alright then. Still should have got them the win. Oh sorry, I was posting somewhere else about how Spain were the most favoured team by FIFA ever and mixed them up. UEFA it is. No need for name-calling now, makes you look a bit of a **** really.

Hahaha, darn, I don't get this barcelona bandwagon. It infuriates me, they're a good team, yes they are the best side in the world from their performances in the past 3 years, but that doesn't mean that they're untouchable, arsenal nearly beat them, chelsea were robbed of a win, inter beat them, madrid beat them. They're so overhyped it's unbelievable, only thing that annoys me more is man city bandwagoners thinking they were gonna win the champions league with a manager who's never been to a semi final in the CL.

Where did I say that I thought it wasnt a penalty?

Them two were penalties, but I can see why they werent given (thinking it hit the body/not seeing it).

Only an idiot confuses FIFA and UEFA if they know anything about football.

Chelsea would have been in that final if Essien wasnt stupid and passed it straight to Messi on the edge of the box. For all Chelsea's dominance their finishing was awful. And lets not forget Barca had a player wrongly sent off.

You're an idiot. Have you heard of linesmen?
Plus, the other two were controversial, drogba's shirt was pulled (penalty)
The ref blew the whistle when malouda got fouled IN THE BOX. That can be half and half so I don't blame him for giving the free kick, but it could just as easily been a penalty.

Yes I know that, but i'll rather have ten men and 2 penalty appeals against you turned down than 11 men and no penalties given.

You're correct about many things in this post, but Barcelona are certainly not overhyped, who knows how many more league titles and champions leagues they'll win if they continue to perform like they do? They could literally wipe the floor at the moment with pretty much any club apart from Madrid who they beat relatively comfortably recently. It could be any number of European trophies tbh.

Oh and I'm a big fan of City even though I don't support them. They have an incredible group of players who I think could easily reach the Champions league final in the next few years. In terms of individual talent, they're many levels above any premier league team.

I highy doubt anyone in the world thinks they are unbeatable   No team has ever bean unbeatable.

I'm not saying anything about the players in man city, they all have the talent and have gelled, but didn't inter have an incredible group of players too? Mancini basically had most of the team that won the treble in 2010, yet he didn't reach one semi final. Also, no one can use the hard group excuse, villareal were poor and had their star players injured in the middle and got zero points, look at chelsea's group, genk got a draw in each game at home, valencia and leverkusen are at napoli's level, who went above city, how comes chelsea went top of the group then? Seeing as if you look at the scores in aggregate, we beat every team in the group. City should have done the same thing with their players.

Ok, did barcelona wipe the floor with chelsea? they wiped the floor with arsenal when they ended up with 10 men and arsenal were in the game till the 90th minute so they didn't wipe the floor with them.
 
 
 
I highy doubt anyone in the world thinks they are unbeatable   No team has ever bean unbeatable.

 

There are bandwagoners who say that you can't beat barca over two legs and they're a mile above the rest.
That's why i'm saying this.
 
 
 
You're an idiot. Have you heard of linesmen?

The ref blew the whistle when malouda got fouled IN THE BOX. That can be half and half so I don't blame him for giving the free kick, but it could just as easily been a penalty.

 

Maybe they didnt have a clear line of sight? Or missed it for any other number of reasons. The point is that only 2 of them were anywhere near penalties, Drogba had an awful first touch, saw Valdes collect the ball and then fell over. Chelsea fans like to be bawbags though and think that they were 'robbed'. You see dozens of instances of the ball hitting a player on the arm and the ref not giving it every saturday. If Chelsea really were a good team, they would have made their dominance pay, rather than trying to scrape a 1-0. And even then, it was Essien's and your defences fault for giving the ball away easily and not closing Messi/Iniesta down on the edge of the box quick enough.

So what is moaning going to accomplish? Nothing. Teams have decisions go against them all the time (yes, even Barca do   ), quit your moaning and get on with it. Chelsea have the most bawbags in a squad in the history of football. Full of cry babies.

I'm finding it hard to take you seriously in all honesty. First of all, City's current squad is far superior to any previous inter squad, so to compare the two and say that City can't reach the final under Mancini is just appalling.

Secondly, Chelsea could never have got out of City's group, I'm never ever going to be convinced that they could win against Bayern and Napoli, that would would never happen. Chelsea just about got out of a fairly easy group.

I agree with you on the barca bit, that's why I said they could wipe the floor with teams right now as it stands. And yes, in my opinion they deserved the 2006, 2009, 2011 European cups. They deserved all of them, and they'll probably win more in the near future.

Ok then, why am I even bothering.
1. The ball hitting a player on the arm doesn't count as ball to hand when their arm is high. Which was why valencia got a penalty against chelsea for kalou's stupid handball.
2. Chelsea did make their dominance pay, hence getting 2 stonewall penalty decisions and 2 controversial penalty decisions which would have sealed the game if given, sorry but if you pull someones shirt, it's a foul, If you tug someones shirt even if they're away from the ball, it's a foul. Especially if they're from behind.
3. We don't complain about other games, we didn't complain that much when ramires went down and we should have got a penalty against united last season in the champions league.
4. Ok then, do you know the players? How do you know they're crybabies? 'Fans like you annoy me, yes essien made a mistake, but did he not score the opener? Sighs.

1) You dont seem to be getting the point that these things happen to every team, and are easily not given (for ball to hand/thinking it hits the body/cant see etc), the other ones werent penalties, one was a free kick and the other Drogba dived.
2) Chelsea didnt make their dominance pay, unless Chelsea's only way to score is via the penalty spot.
3) Chelsea complain about virtually everything.
4) So what if Essien scored the opener? He gave away the ball in one of the worst possible places and cost you the tie.

You are overating napoli big time, they're a very good side, but we would have got past that group and got at least 2nd. So if we face napoli and beat them in two legs, will you be convinced then? So basically, you're saying that valencia and leverkusen are crap. Napoli are 5th in the league and came 3rd last season, valencia are 3rd and came 3rd last season, not much of a difference.

With the mancini comments. So julio cesar/toldo, maicon, zanetti,chivu, samuel cordoba, stankovic, cambiasso, ibrahimovic in their prime were nowhere near as good or better as richards, clichy, kompany, lescott, toure? So them winning 3 serie A titles in a row under mancini even with AC milan there (they only lost points for the scandal in one season) means that they're not cut out for winning the champions league.

Why was it with 5 signings, lucio, sneijder, eto, milito and motta they were able to win the treble in 2010?
We can beat bayern, straight up, they're a good side, but we can match them, just like we matched city last week.

Ok, they can wipe teams on current form over the past season, but they don't always do that right because football doesn't work like that.

1. Drogba had his shirt tugged in the penalty area with abidal behind him, that's a foul, even if he did dive after. If silva against us last week was a penalty even though he went to ground easily then so is that.
2. The penalties would have got us 2 goals, which would have made our dominance pay.
3. We complain about things that aren't fair, same way all other fans complain. Look at city against chelsea, they try to start a fight in the tunnel because ashley did a bit of banter after the match, talk about sour grapes, other teams complain and have a **** attitude to the game sometimes.
4. Yes he was at fault for the goal. I admit it, but that goal wouldn't have meant anything if we got our penalty decisions.

You're living in the past. Chelsea around 08-10 were a very good side, but they arent that side anymore. Its debatable whether they are even the 4th best team in England, nevermind Europe. Nowadays they are quite poor, and Barca/Real/Milan/Bayern would walk through them.

1) No, Drogba lost control of the ball and fell over. Clear dive.
2) For all of Chelsea's supposed dominance they should have been able to get another goal from open play against 10 men.
3) No, Chelsea take complaining to a new level. Look at what we're talking about now. Nearly 3 years on and you're still bawing on about it.
4) But you didnt get the decisions, so his mistake cost you. Deal with it.

I think we're better than we used to be tbh.
Sturridge and mata have done something to the wings that we've lacked since the mourinho days with robben and duff. Our midfield problems of 2011 have now been solved, romeu and ramires have offered something new.
Only thing that's been poor is our previously solid defence which held up against city who are a very good side don't get me wrong.

We had one poor season, came second but trophyless nevertheless and now we're not even considered as the 4th best team in england.
This is a joke right, you're doing this to annoy me. At the end of the season, chelsea will be in top 4 and probably get to the semi finals of one competition or even win a trophy.

Sturridge and mata have done something to the wings that we've lacked since the mourinho days with robben and duff. Our midfield problems of 2011 have now been solved, romeu and ramires have offered something new.
Only thing that's been poor is our previously solid defence which held up against city who are a very good side don't get me wrong.

We had one poor season, came second but trophyless nevertheless and now we're not even considered as the 4th best team in england.
This is a joke right, you're doing this to annoy me. At the end of the season, chelsea will be in top 4 and probably get to the semi finals of one competition or even win a trophy.

 

That says it all, im talking to a biased moron.

You think that your current team, thats sits 3rd in the league, has an awful defence, out of the LC and just scraped through the CL and has no hope of winning it, is better than your double winning team that was solid at the back and brilliant upfront, had a goalscoring midfielder and had probably the best striker on the planet besides Ronaldo and Messi?

Good day, im not arguing with an idiot.
 
 
 
1) No, Drogba lost control of the ball and fell over. Clear dive.
2) For all of Chelsea's supposed dominance they should have been able to get another goal from open play against 10 men.
3) No, Chelsea take complaining to a new level. Look at what we're talking about now. Nearly 3 years on and you're still bawing on about it.
4) But you didnt get the decisions, so his mistake cost you. Deal with it.

 

1. Agree to disagree because i'm not bothered arguing this with you.
2. We should have, but blocking a shot and a clear sight on goal from open play would obviously affect us scoring a goal would it not? Answer me this at least instead of diverting.
3. Of course, we have the right to complain, that was absolute rubbish refereeing all round for both teams, it's the champions league against two of the best sides in the world, why would you have referees influence the game negatively instead of the players? United complain about drogba's offside goal that won us the title, so we have the right to complain about this one.
4. Yes I know, i'm just saying, being the best team in the world, you don't have to cheat and blatently handball it so the team you're facing is going to beat you because you'll beat them fair and square.

Next second i'll hear you say that motta fouled busquetts and deserved to be sent off.

I'm the idiot. Oh gosh, we have a chance of winning it.
Ok, we won the double, but who was there for competition? it was a united team that lost the best player in the world at the time besides messi and tevez, a tottenham team that came out of nowhere, a city team that hadn't finished their team yet and arsenal who were just content being in the top 4 and liverpool who had lost alonso and lucas was crap at the time with torres out for a long time. Every single team has improved from then.

We came first but left it till the last game and beat every team at home, that isn't really scraping it to the last 16, we just left it late.

So lampard isn't a goalscoring midfielder even though he's scored 7 goals in the PL already? Ok then.
So sturridge isn't scoring, he's a striker/winger and is unplayable when on form which he is.
Our defence hasn't been at it's best, but neither has man city's who struggle to keep a clean sheet.

The mourinho days of conceding 15 goals a season was a miracle, I don't see another team in the PL doing that in the next decade.

One question, who do you support?
 
 
 
You're an idiot. Have you heard of linesmen?
Plus, the other two were controversial, drogba's shirt was pulled (penalty)
The ref blew the whistle when malouda got fouled IN THE BOX. That can be half and half so I don't blame him for giving the free kick, but it could just as easily been a penalty.

 

I agree completely. I was there that night and it was absolutely horrific. There is absolutely no way to reason, empathise or understand any of the officials' decisions. It was a game we could have won five or six nil, and let's not forget was the CHAMPIONS LEAGUE SEMI FINAL. If it had been a premier league game it could be forgotten, but this was robbery pure and simple. If you say the referee was out of his depth then blame UEFA, but how we ended up being fined with players banned is beyond me.

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iow1a...eature=related 

Watch the full highlights and someone honestly say we weren't 10x the team Barcelona were on the night. A Barcelona side who massacred Man United in the final don't forget.

rant over.
 
 
Don't understand the crying over spilled milk but as an Arsenal fan who very much enjoyed Iniesta's winner which served as a prozac directly after getting battered in the semi-finals ourselves, I've got to say Chelsea were absolutely robbed that night. Must be said though that Chelsea were lucky in the first leg. Overall Chelsea were more screwed over by the refs but the whole tie was ruined by poor refereeing for both teams.

The thing is, i'm not crying over spilled milk, it's just that saying you are a better side than us because we dominated you and got screwed over by the refs when we faced you is a joke tbh.
That plus the fact that he was saying we weren't messed up that night and that barca were the better side although in the highlights barca had 2 highlights, one being a foul that wasn't allowed by the ref and the second being the goal while we had every night, which by you being a neutral saying we were robbed says something.

He also said that city are much better than the inter side mancini managed. Maybe in terms of depth, but the first team matched city's first team.
 
 
the final this year i think will be bayern munich and real madrid

I told myself I wouldn't reply, but your stupidity is annoying.

I never said that you weren't on the wrong end of refereeing decisions. What I did say, was that only the handballs were penalties, and even then I could see how they weren't given (seeing as those type of situations happen dozens of times a week). And I said several times that Chelsea dominated the match, try reading in future.
 
 
 
There are bandwagoners who say that you can't beat barca over two legs and they're a mile above the rest.
That's why i'm saying this.

 

They are "A mile above the rest" in terms of quality of their team

No they're not, they have very good players that are world beaters that work well together as a unit, that's how barca work, player for player, I would say that madrid beat them besides in midfield.

Compare them player for player, casillas>alves carvalho=puyol, pepe=pique, marcelo>abidal, sergio ramos=alves.
Alonso>busquetts and mascherano, xavi>khedira, iniesta>ozil,
messi>benzema, ronaldo>villa/sanchez/pedro, di maria=sanchez/pedro/villa in the winger role.

Comparing them player for player, they're at the same level. Just that barca's team work better together than real madrid with their system of play, and even then, real madrid are on a different level this season and will match barcelona better than they have ever had in barca's time of dominance.
 
 
 
real madrid and barcelona

 

Would be a great final.
 
 
 
Would be a great final.

 

Boring... I really don´t want a final between two teams from one country, we see them play each other at least twice a year anyway.

And that makes it boring? Aren't the games entertaining too?
 
 
 
Oh ok then, remind me how much money madrid have spent on the champions league and reaching their first semi final in 6 years?
Barcelona: zlatan ibrahimovic, that is all.
Man united: so 30 million on rooney, 20 something million on ferdinand, 20 million for carrick, 30 million for berbatov. But I guess united don't spend money.
Unless you're arsenal or valencia (who don't even properly challenge for major honours wonder why) you can't complain about spending money.
Leeds united.
Inter milan: financial problems led eto'o and almost led sneijder to leave and they spent loads on players too.

So yeah go on.

 

I know a lot of clubs have spent a lot of money - but we're talking about deserving to win it.

(Leeds will rise again)
 
 
Real vs Arsenal- trust me
 
 
 
Real vs Arsenal- trust me

 

I hope so!  
 
 
Arsenal in the final? Don't make me laugh. You haven't beaten an in form team all season.
 
 
Current form would put Real Madrid in there, and probably Chelsea or Bayern Munich.
 
 
Draw about to take place for the first knock-out round. Should give us a taster who'll get close and who will get knocked out..
 
 
AC MILAN v ARSENAL

NAPOLI v CHELSEA

Both amongst the toughest possible opponenets.
 
 
MARSEILLE v INTER MILAN

ZENIT ST PETERSBURG v BENFICA

CSKA MOSCOW v REAL MADRID

BAYER LEVERKUSEN v BARCELONA

BASEL v BAYERN MUNICH

AC MILAN v ARSENAL

NAPOLI v CHELSEA

LYON v APOEL
 
 
  ffs
 
 
Bayern and Lyon probably the most happy with that draw.
 
 
Real Madrid and Leverkusen in the final, Arsenal and Barcelona the other 2 semi-finalists.
 
 
Another draw after this round to show the route to the final isn't there?
 
 
Arsenal in the final? roflcakes
 
 
CB91, who did Liverpool get in the draw?
 
 
 
Real Madrid and Leverkusen in the final, Arsenal and Barcelona the other 2 semi-finalists.

 

Are you drunk?
 
 
I´m pretty sure Barcelona, Bayern and Lyon are trough to the quarter final. Leverkusen will almost certainly lose (99.9%) but these 2 games could show a new approach on how to counter Barcelona, Sam and Schürrle are incredibly fast wingers.

Running fast without having the ball isn't really useful though.. Seems like there are 4 easy games and 4 tough.
 
 
in other news, man utd take on ajax... oh wait...
 
 
 
Arsenal in the final? Don't make me laugh. You haven't beaten an in form team all season.

 

you could easily say the same for man utd and real madrid
 
 
 
CB91, who did Liverpool get in the draw?

 

I believe we got Oldham in the FA Cup and City in the League Cup semi finals.

On topic though, cant see both Chelsea going through. Napoli are brutally good at counter attacking, combine that with Chelsea's weak defence and I think they'll scrape it.

And Dortmund were in very good form when we beat them.
 
 
Wouldn't be surprised if UEFA are fixing this to get a Barca Real final, considering the domination of English teams in getting into the final in the last 6 seasons
 
 
Clearly, the pick of the ties in Europe are the City and United matches.

UEFA will make more money if it is a Real Madrid v Barcelona semi-final as there would be two legs rather than one big final.

I think the English domination may be crumbling. Good chance that we see no English teams in the quarter-finals..

If they're so 'brutally good' why are they fifth in the league and 9 points off the leaders.

And if our defence is so 'weak' how come we didn't concede a single goal at home in the group stages and nullified the likes of Silva, Aguero, Ballotelli for the majority of the game on Monday?

Good chance?!

When was the last time Arsenal didn't win at the San Siro?

When was the last time Chelsea got knocked out of the CL to a team not in Europe's Top 8 seeded list?
 
 
barca and ac milan or real madrid now city and united have been knocked out.
 
 
 
you could easily say the same for man utd and real madrid

 

You can't claim that Barca are the only form team in La Liga though, the likes of Atletico Villarreal and Valencia are always tough games and Madrid have been very solid this season.

Also I don't think Man Utd will be in the final somehow.

Try reading. I said "brutally good at counter attacking ".

And so what if you didnt concede at home? Its a two legged tie and damage can be done away.
 
 
Now the Manchester boys are out it has to be barca, real madrid, chelsea, bayer in semi finals
 
 
So chelsea have napoli, if we beat them, can everyone shut up about city having a hard group and not getting through?
 
 
 
Now the Manchester boys are out it has to be barca, real madrid, chelsea, bayer in semi finals

 

Arsenal can be included there, a fit van persie will do wonders for this arsenal side, ian wright said it before, with a few more signings, arsenal can win the league.

that deends how you put it
this year valdez has been as good as casillas if not better
Pepe equal to pique is laughable pique is alot better
puyol is better than carvalho

Pedro and villa are better than di maria
 
 
If they can beat AC (a very hard draw, even if london teams have been AC's downfall in Europe recently), and if RvP stays fit, Arsenal should never be written off.

Chelsea have an interesting draw at Napoli, with the away game first (advantage Chelsea). Chelsea should win, at which point only if they draw Barca/Real can I not see them reaching the final.

Real + Barca look set for the quarter-finals. Real will not enjoy their away game (astro-turf, in Russia's winter), so that will be the most interesting of the two ties.

Inter shouldn't be ruled out. Domestically they've been dire, but in Europe they've been strong (admittedly to weaker opposition).

Bayern will reach the quater-finals, if any team will upset Barca/Real's party, it'll be them. Ten men for most of the game tonight, won 3-0 in the second half (domestic match). Incredibly strong this season, Neuer was a great signing.
 
 
AC and Napoli have been in great form in this season's European football. Arsenal and Chelsea will definitely have to try and take advantage in their away games.

PS- I know the fixtures are in february time however, does anyone know which Arsenal/Chelsea games will be aired on ITV? (I do not have SS)

The first leg of Milan/Arsenal is on ITV. I presume that means the second leg of Napoli/Chelsea will also be shown.

Thanks for the quick response dude, pos repped ya!

I wish European football didn't have such a big gap, I cannot wait until Feb for these awesome fixtures:~
 
 
The highly likely semi-finalists are probably:

1. Barcelona (formidable squad)
2. Real Madrid (formidable squad)
3. Bayern Munich (will want to win the cup at home)
4. Either Chelsea (Will not win the PL, CC and the FA Cup) or Benfica (seem to be lucky)

Barca>All above
Real Madrid> All except Barcelona
Bayern Munich> All except Madrid/Barca.

Therefore the final will probably be either:

1. Real Madrid vs Barcelona
or
2. Barcelona vs Bayern Munich

Chelsea didn't concede a goal at home. Napoli and AC milan both did, Chelsea's form at home in the champions league has probably been the best, maybe real madrid can argue since they got 18 points, but in the CL at home stamford bridge has been a fortress. 5-0, 2-0, 3-0.
It's away we've been dire, we were unlucky at leverkusen, the goal at valencia was waiting to happen and we threw it away at genk, who got a draw at home to every team in our group.
 
 
I can see chelsea getting to the final, if not, they'll get knocked in the semis.
Chelsea have little to no chance if we face madrid though. Ronaldo and di maria will have a field day.
 
 
Also, there's a weird statistic, since 2003, every team that chelsea lost to in the champions league ends up in the final and more often than not win it.

AC vs arsenal, arsenal can win it. Mertesacker can keep ibrahimovic quiet, it all depends on what striker milan gets in the transfer window I think.

Real and barca are through to the quarters.

Inter are through, their Serie A form isn't as bad as you think now, they just did an arsenal, but now they're sorting themselves out and after the schalke match, I don't think inter are gonna underestimate anyone.
 
 
 
Are you drunk?

 

You're right, football has never produced any surprises, least of all in a knockout competition.

And neg, seriously?

Yes I am, ibrahimovic is slow, mertesacker won't have pace problems and he's just as strong as ibra.
Dawson and gallas handled him, mertesacker can too then.

mertesacker is incredibly slow, and whilst ibrahimovic is by no means usain bolt, he has a fair bit of pace, far more than pers.... dawson and gallas may not have conceded against him, but lets not forget the numerous off the line clearances, and the fact that for 4/5 of the 180 mins, tottenham were DOMINATED. don't simply use the tottenham did it so obv we can too line of thought, that is just pure foolishness. that milan team was heavily weakened by injuries, and in a completely different mental state to the one of today. the one of today has more and better players at its disposal. if milan have their full strength side on offer, i see no reason why they can't win.

----------------------------------abbiati-----------------------------------------

-- abate -- nesta/mexes -- silva ( unstoppable ) -- taiwo/antonini ( antonini is admittedly, a very weak link ) --

--------- nocerino --------- mvb/seedorf/ambrosini ------- aquilani/boateng-----

-----------------------------boateng/robinho------------------------------------------

--------------------------robinho/pato----------------- ibrahimovic--------------------

seems very foolish to write off that lineup, IMHO.

The only guys that were injured in that milan team for the ties was pirlo, although their most influential player, you can live without him, the rest of the players were there.
Anyway, I see arsenal giving it a go, it'll be a close game thats for sure, arsenal's record does speak for itself though but lets see with this arsenal team.

Antonini was playing a lot last season, they only had him and zambrotta and jankulovski wasn't playing much anymore and I think antonini is first choice left back, taiwo says he doesn't play enough.

The only players I accept are because of injury are gattuso(for pirlo's injury) and amelia(abbiati) They could have still played their best team possible if they wanted to.
In their diamond formation that would be:
Amelia
abate nesta silva antonini
Flamini
seedorf boateng
robinho
pato ibra

besides the goalie, is that first team injury ravaged? They were probably shuffling players around because they wanted to win serie A so gave them a rest. Although Arsenal have been putting pretty much the same team on for nearly 2 months and have lost like 2 games in that period.
 
 
Lyon is going to the final this year.

I'm sorry you are just incorrect. i know what I'm talking about because I'm a milan fan and watch them every week, heck i was even at white hart lane when we played them off the pitch.
 
 
2012 CL FINAL

Real vs Bayern Munic

Semi - Real vs Barc -- Bayern vs Chelsea!
 
 
 
I'm sorry you are just incorrect. i know what I'm talking about because I'm a milan fan and watch them every week, heck i was even at white hart lane when we played them off the pitch.

 

In what way am i incorrect.
I never said you didn't outplay them.
I'm just saying, you had a strong enough team that couldn't do the job.
I'm not saying this cos I favour the english over italians either, I know if chelsea face madrid, chelsea are out of the champions league. After last time, I don't think we'll get wiped by barca but I don't rate chelsea's chances either. I think that AC milan won't beat arsenal, Arsenal are a surprise package, lost their best players and have half their team injured but they're still winning games. When their full backs and the whole team come back I think they'll be much better. That's why I think arsenal can beat milan.
 
 
 
Lyon is going to the final this year.

 

I can see them surprising us. But at most I see a semi final for them, seeing as they don't knock out real madrid anymore since mourinho came, I think their only chance is facing bayern/arsenal/milan/chelsea.

Also, I can't count out inter, as much as everyone has been complaining about them, they are racking up the wins and are now 5th, 11 points behind the leaders with a game in hand, compare that to the relegation zone 2 months ago. It's similar to the arsenal situation.

what is important is the POINT DIFFERENCE between 5th, and the relegation zone. This is actually incredibly small... Inter are 5th with 23 points, Atalanta are 15th with 17 points....

Same as Marseille situation, we are now 5th and i can see us win the inter. Lyon will knock out apoel. So that could be a marseille-Lyon in the quarter, there would be a french in the semi like 2 years ago.

I know, but with inter's game in hand that affects it. But yes, although people say the PL is the most competitive league, I would say it's serie A, all the teams are of a very good level, napoli, udinese, juventus, roma, lazio have vastly improved and have very good teams, then you have palermo and others would beat the likes of fulham and stoke too who are their english counterparts. There's no top 6 that's better than everyone else in serie A either.
It's no longer the 3 horse race of inter, juve and AC anymore.
I still think inter will come back and qualify for the champions league.

Yep, it is very possible lyon or marseille will get to the semis, there isn't too much difference in quality between the sides either. Inter are on a up, they will be very tough for marseille. Their attacking options, pazzini, forlan, milito(who hasn't been at his best), zarate cannot be underestimated.

Neither can valbuena, lucho and others. I think it'll be a very close match tbh. But if inter bring their A game like the 2010 inter, it'll be unlikely for you to win, although they probably won't.

Mourinho made the 2010-inter. Seriously, i don't fear the inter that much even though it will be tough (all games are) and probably 50/50. They currently win but play a poor football and so do we. can't wait for it, marseille is an after-january team.

Similar to inter last season, they were 5th at this point and got 2nd at the end. Marseille vs inter will be a good match I think, this is where the champions league becomes the best competition in the world.
 
 
Leverkusen vs barcelona, I reckon barcelona should win this 2-1 or 3-1. If not, I see a draw. They both have been doing poor in their leagues to where they should be tbf.
 
 
Manchester Utd according to SAF, had they gotten to the knockout stages.

I won't be surprised if lyon lose tonight. We've got ourselves the everton of the champions league (i.e. the giant killers who take the game to penalties)

Hype was well deserved due to the smashing starts both the teams made to the season. It also reflects in the fact that City are 17 points clear of the premier league teams remaining in the Champions League. United didn't get through because of complacency (letting go of leads against Basel and Benfica, Vidic's absence in the earlier games also contributed to that). City had a very tough group.

Don't use the city had a tough group excuse, champions league winners should be topping that group, simple as, city lost, tough group yes, but they're better than napoli and have more squad depth than bayern, should really have topped that group or come at least 2nd. Chelsea had a tough group too but still came top, plus city are first in the league.

Villareal are in a relegation battle atm and had their 2 best players injured for a long time while they were in the champions league.
So it's was really a 3 horse race like chelsea's group, simple as.

But they're not Champions League winners, they were tipped to do well or progress in the Champions League. Why would squad depth matter in a Champions League game? You'd play your strongest 11 anyway. Bayern were the better team, and they're incredibly difficult to beat at the Allianz. I believe even Barcelona only got a draw there a few seasons ago, and since then they're a much better team.

City did beat Villareal in both games btw. The fact that they got 10 points- which in most seasons would mean qualifying shows that they were quite unlucky to not progress.

I know they were unlucky to not progress, but you wouldn't play your strongest 11 every match, hence why zabaleta and kolarov got games in the CL even though richards and clichy were fit. They had the league to focus on. This wasn't the knockout rounds. United did the same thing, so did chelsea, arsenal have no squad depth because of their injuries so had to put on the same team every week.

Anyway, as i've established that villareal weren't really tough, genk put up more of a fight when they played at home tbh.

But they played their strongest XI against the toughest opposition which was Bayern. United, Chelsea, Arsenal would've played their strongest possible team against Bayern unless the match was a dead rubber.

Lets face it, man city are out because they underestimated napoli. The second they drew against napoli at home they should have realised they will be a challenge.
 
 
 
Madrid never make an impact in CL.

 

It's easy to tell you're not much older than 14.
 
 
Real Madrid vs Bayern Munich

Bayern to knock out Barcelona.

But then Barca are the kind of team to do well even though they're not in their league.
 
 
Well, watch APOEL beat lyon, the crawley town of the champions league.
Bayer leverkusen are parking the bus, I heard they had 22% possession in the first half...

22%  

I'd hate to play Fifa against a Barcelona player, they'd probably spend 80 minutes of the games just passing it around before scoring a near enough impossible goal with Messi

They'd hate to play against me, I'll park the bus the whole game and score from a set piece.(usually an unstoppable free kick)  . I'll then proceed to play ultra defensive and play 6-4-0 once i've got the lead.

Thanks for the insult! I shouldve expanded on my post though so I cant expect different from you. Through the whole history of the tournament theyve done well winning the most CL trophies but what I meant was in recent years theyve not much of an impact. In the last 6 CL tournaments (not including this years one), theyve only passed the last 16 once and lost in the semis to Barcelona, losing to them is understandable though.
 
 
The draw will have a massive impact. Am I right in thinking the next draw determines the route to the final? (ie you know what the QF, SF and Final split is?)

One of Barca and Real Madrid will be there.

Yeah pretty much. I reckon madrid and barca will be in different groups(if they both go through)
Madrid can't really lose to CSKA and barca have already pretty much won the tie vs leverkusen because of away goals.

Bayern lost to basel, I can see basel just defending for 90 mins and getting a 1-1 draw, they have a lot of spirit, I can also see bayern battering them 4-1 though so bayerns entry to the quarters isn't guaranteed.

Milan are pretty much through,
napoli are favourites to go through, although I think who goes through in the chelsea match will go down to who scores first and the away goal has pretty much kept us in the tie.

Marseille and inter will go down to the wire, can see inter scraping through with a 2-0 or something(no disrespect to Marseille)

Lyon vs APOEL, neither will go past the quarters, I wouldn't count APOEL out though after getting top spot of a group of recent europa league winners although they will not be in the semi final.

I forgot the score vs benfica and zenit, they are two evenly matched teams though, benfica might be a little stronger.

More a joke than an insult, but yea Madrid have been amazing in the champions league in the long term. However, as you say, in recent years they've been under performing, relative to spending and the size of the club. I have a feeling this year they'll do better.
 
 
i really would love arsenal to get through, after milian thrashed them 4-0 it would great for arsenal to stage an great comeback. actuallyimage arsenal winning the champions league beating real madrid in the semis and barcelona with cesc fabregas playing in the final.

but it surely wont happen its only just a dream.
 
 
 
I won't be surprised if lyon lose tonight. We've got ourselves the everton of the champions league (i.e. the giant killers who take the game to penalties)

 

Damn, I think I'm psychic...

Anyway, what game do you guys think was the match of the tie?

This round of 16 was arguably the best we've seen in recent years. Chelsea's comeback, arsenal nearly coming back, bayern thrashing basel, messi showing his CL prowess, inter and lyon going out to shock defeats as well.
 
 
More intruiged about the fixed draw tomorrow  
 
 
I said at the round of 16 stage that I could see an English team sneaking into a final.

That ambitious prediction is still on.

If we get barca or madrid in the quarters, we might as well give them a free pass to the semis. Semis however I think we'll step up.

That´s actually not a bad call, the fact that so many underdogs are still in the competition could create an "easy" way to the final.

Imagine one of the two branches being: Benfica, Apoel and Marseille + "XY". Pretty much every other team that´s still in the competition would be expected to make it to the final with those opponents.

Hmm looks like Chelsea got one of the two teams they were hoping for and Barca v Milan is  

Which of these games will be coming on ITV and what date? (not SS because I cannot afford it   ). I can never find out these things  
 
 
I like the way that, at the beginning of this post everybody is carrying on about how great the two Manchester clubs are going to be in this seasons champs league. Well where are they now?

Tuesday 27th/Wednesday 28th March (first legs), and Tuesday 3rd/Wednesday 4th April (second legs). Not sure which will be shown on ITV, but if they're not shown on the main channel aren't they usually broadcast via ITV 2?

You can always stream; that's how I watch the majority of matches.

They'll broadcast Chelsea home because they're the only home team left. They'll also probably want a tie of the Barca-Milan game, or else it'll be the Apoel-Madrid game (Marseille-Munich wouldn't generate enough ratings imo.)
 
 
 
El Clasico  

 

Of course. Like the all manc derby, I thought that was gonna be the europa league final. Oh wait...

I fancy an el classico, but I reckon if milan beat barca and chelsea beat benfica, chelsea will be in the final. Milan had two close games against barcelona.

APOEL are going to get ass ****ed. It'll be a repeat of the tottenham vs real madrid quarter final.

I'm not too sure about that, the thing about chelsea is that they have experience when it's on the big stage, so do you guys tbf but they don't get too many games anymore. Plus if arsenal can score 3 against you guys, it's possible for a chelsea win over 2 legs. I'm not being biased either. I reckon that it would go to away goals.

Arsenal scored 3 against us, but a lot of that has to do with us having scored 4, and the subsequent mindset a lot of the team found themselves fooled into. For me, I just don't see Chelsea winning that, but hey - that's what drives the football business along I guess xD

Even when milan stepped up, arsenal could have still scored the final goal. Well, liverpool beat us in 05 when we should have got the CL that year. So anything is possible, especially with a team as good as ours.

I know you put it into context, but you still can´t use experience as an argument against Milan.

Especially because the best Chelsea players this season have been the inexperienced ones like Mata and Sturridge.

Real Madrid have chance this year if they play ac malian or barcelona in final.
 
 
being honest i reckon it will be a barca vs madrid final unfortunately

but i wish it would be a bayern munich vs ac milan

nice, close encounter not the usual el classico stuff we see:
- madrid score in first 10 mins
- 2 CDM real madrid
- messi scores
- pepe fouls someone
- another barca goal
- fight starts some coaches and subs get involved
- a red card for a madrid player
- busquets dives
- pedro scores
- match ends in a fight with both teams talking trash to the media afterwards

Mata is hardly inexperienced; he's twenty-three and has played 250 career matches...nevertheless, I don't disagree that the older players should be used as Man United use Scholes and Giggs; first teamers, but not first-team-regular starters...
 
 
AC Milan vs Real Madrid I reckon.

I was adding to the point. I was directing it to the guy who quoted him.

Yeah, mata has more than enough experience, he's played in the champions league for the past 3 or so seasons.(well whenever madrid dumped him like they always do)
 
 
I reckon Chelsea could give Barca a game. We've still got the elements of the team that stopped them scoring for over 180 minutes a few years ago.

If we win at Stamford Bridge (as Arsenal showed was possible last year) I'd back us to hold it together in the Nou Camp.

Yup. I reckon we'll give you guys a game too. I think barca are overrated. They are the best team in the world, but you can stop them from scoring, get a goal then defend. We were stupidly unlucky that match, I think that you guys can beat them. If you get a late goal at camp nou then that'll help, if you just limit them to a goal. Although now the pitch is a swamp barca are at a slight advantage. They will dominate possession that's for sure.
 
 
 
Real Madrid have chance this year if they play ac malian or barcelona in final.

 

Real madrid have a chance if they play anyone. Anyway I reckon liverpool mk2 could happen with chelsea, chelsea finish 5th. We win/get to the CL final. I hope we face bayern munich if we do get to the final. I really don't fancy real madrid.
Why the neg?
 
 
I'm actually clueless as to what will happen...
Bayern could snatch it. I reckon real will win, but real madrid have a tough test to face. Robben will be up for it and I would love to see him score at the bernabeu.

I reckon 2-2 draw in the first leg and 4-2 win to madrid in the second leg.
 
 
 
The highly likely semi-finalists are probably:

1. Barcelona (formidable squad)
2. Real Madrid (formidable squad)
3. Bayern Munich (will want to win the cup at home)
4. Either Chelsea (Will not win the PL, CC and the FA Cup) or Benfica (seem to be lucky)

Barca>All above
Real Madrid> All except Barcelona
Bayern Munich> All except Madrid/Barca.

Therefore the final will probably be either:

1. Real Madrid vs Barcelona
or
2. Barcelona vs Bayern Munich

 

You're pretty good at predicting things.
 
 
The gulf in class and quality is massive but Chelsea wont allow it to be an open game, they will park the proverbial bus in thier penalty area and make it as difficult as possible.

Barca will go through but it wont necessarily be the embarrassment that it really should be when you compare the two teams.

Why are you so angry? You need to drink son.
 
 
Barca should easily go through. Chelsea will be underdogs in both home and away so i can't see them stopping barca. The best result chelsea can have at home to barca is a 1-0 victory, though it is unlikely, but still this won't be enough to stop barca running riot at the camp nou.

The other semi is too difficult to predict. Real madrid will be better on papers but bayern are a force to reckon with. If robben, gomez and ribery have a good game than Real could be in trouble.

Looking at the teams left i will love to see an el-clasico final, this will be the game of the decade. I hope it doesn't contain any controversies.

Damn, everyone hates chelsea. It means we're doing something right for once. I don't care because I don't see any reason to hate us besides our money and our ruthless owner, you guys can hate on inter and real madrid if you wanna do that.
I would play with 3 goalkeepers if you were allowed to do that. I don't care anyway, we'll try to upset the odds again and shut up the haters.  
It's because everyone wanted city and united to go to the semis and neither of them did. Oh well. haters gonna hate.

Even if we did beat barca, people will still say we won't win because we would have to face the second best team in the world or face a team at their home stadium in the final.

Not according to the media. So therefore since the media dictate the result before a match(sarcasm) then barca are the best team in the world by far and only real madrid are anywhere close, the rest of the teams are a pile of crap.

Wait, where is the hate? I wouldn't say predicting Chelsea to raise their game, defend in numbers and come away with a respectable defeat is hating.

Come on, we're not that crap, I will say that man city should beat chelsea/liverpool/newcastle 6-1 because their team is much better when you compare them but you know that won't happen because those 3 have good teams(as much as we complain about liverpool being ****),

Thank you, somehow we're in a semi final. Despite us being '****' as people call it, we've just been effective when we need to be, no one can even say luck of the draw, we got the second hardest people to face in the round of 16 when we could have got zenit or marseille. No one remembers that.

Come on, we're not that crap, I will say that man city should beat chelsea/liverpool/newcastle 6-1 because their team is much better when you compare them but you know that won't happen because those 3 have good teams(as much as we complain about liverpool being ****),

 

I watched them against Benfica and it was horrible. They've not looked convincing all season and struggled regularly against premier league fodder, there's nothing I can see to suggest they stand a chance. You've got a tough period around those games as well with the FA cup before hand and Arsenal sandwiched in between. It would be a struggle for any side to play 4 games of that intensity back to back so late on in the season. It's not a dig at Chelsea just my honest assessment, I'd say the same if was Newcastle with that run in

I know that. We've grinded results by the skin of our teeth (today included) but good teams are known to do that. even barca do that sometimes like against madrid in the copa del rey and quite a few times this season against teams and united are the worst of the lot in grinding wins.

Yeah I agree with you that we can crash so easily. We haven't played good, but at the end of the day, it's the results that count, we have been getting results since mid february which is what matters and no other team can deny that we have been in good form, probably only united/arsenal have been in better form than us(in terms of results) and you guys have basically matched us.
 
 
Chelsea and Bayern
 
 
 
Ream Madrid are the best team in the world right now.

 

And do we have any evidence to support this OUTRAGEOUS claim?
 
 
 
Damn, everyone hates chelsea. It means we're doing something right for once. I don't care because I don't see any reason to hate us besides our money and our ruthless owner, you guys can hate on inter and real madrid if you wanna do that.
I would play with 3 goalkeepers if you were allowed to do that. I don't care anyway, we'll try to upset the odds again and shut up the haters.  
It's because everyone wanted city and united to go to the semis and neither of them did. Oh well. haters gonna hate.

Even if we did beat barca, people will still say we won't win because we would have to face the second best team in the world or face a team at their home stadium in the final.

 

The fans?
 
 
 
Man Utd vs Man City.

 

good prediction mate  
 
 
 
The fans?

 

Weird, inter fans were singing jose mourinho when ranieri was manager. Real madrid complain about their manager half of the time and half the spanish players want him out. So yeah, stop bandwagoning the chelsea hate.

Weird, because there are more man united fans in london and haven't even been to manchester than there are fans in manchester.

I don't like ManUre either, actually. Oh, and by the way, when I said fans, I meant "fans" who would probably support United if Chelsea were a mid-table or (god forbid) a Championship side, although the way Chelski are playing, that may well be the case. The top clubs live off plastic fans.

That's there for every club. Even arsenal. I know an arsenal fan who became a man city fan last year for example.
 
 
Bayern Munich and Barcelona.
 
 
hope Bayern win it
 
 
Yeah bayern vs barca. But no doubt barca will win because the ref will allow them to play with 12 men.  
 
 
I see that a lot of people think it will be a Bayern/Barca final.

I do think that UEFA will help Bayern out slightly. They dislike Mourinho and especially after his post-match interview, after the Apoel game.

In all fairness, Bayern are excellent at going forward; I think they have the second best front-three in the world at the moment. However, I think Real Madrid will be just too strong for them in the end, I can't see Bayern's defence coping with constant bombardment from Ronaldo, Marcelo, Higuain, Benzema and Kaka.

I feel that a lot of Bayerns goals are defendable (Ribery/Robben run down the wing and pass it across for Gomez to kick/head it in), whereas Real Madrid score astonishing goals that are unstoppable at times.
 
 
 
And do we have any evidence to support this OUTRAGEOUS claim?

 

The La Liga league table.
 
 
 
That's there for every club. Even arsenal. I know an arsenal fan who became a man city fan last year for example.

 

Which is why I don't particularly like Arsenal either. Or Spurs. Or Liverpool 'this is our year' F.C or Man City.

So all the big teams. So we should just support the lower league teams, when they become successful we should stop supporting them?

Arsenal fan through and through. My dad has supported them since early seventies and i intend on carrying on the tradition. LOL "this is our year" every time with them.

The most ridiculous one i know is a guy that supports Newcastle, has been to St. James' once (I think) and lives in London. But he's a fan through and through. He took a lot of stick at school when they got relegated. What would you class this?

I like Newcastle. They've overachieved this year and may keep Chelsea out of Europe, plus they have very few fake fans. Seeing as he didn't decide to support Man. United as soon as they went down, that's fine.

No, support the team most local to you, whether it's Chelsea of Crawley, and not the team you think is most likely to win the league that year.

It's west ham, but oh well, I don't see the point, there's a liverpool fan in east london, he gets a lot of stick despite them doing **** for the past 3 years compared to where they should be. If chelsea got relegated I would still support them. How do you know that newcastle have few fake fans? When they get into europe consistently the fans will crawl out of the woodwork. I've been to stamford bridge before, I would go more if I wasn't at uni. I just like chelsea, I live next to upton park, but chelsea have been my favourite team since I was 5, before we had a realistic chance of winning the league.

I know two newcastle fans in london, both have been to upton park and both supported them when they got relegated.

You're excluding the most significant factor, that of 'supporter inheritance'; a love for a particular football club normally runs through families, and will be passed on to the next generation. For example, my dad moved from France to North London in his late teens, and started supporting Arsenal since they were now his local team and due to the fact that he wanted to 'integrate' with the locals. I was born and now live in the Fulham/Chelsea area, but my dad instilled in me and my siblings a love for Arsenal when I was young, so it never even crossed our minds to support Fulham or Chelsea. My brother lives in France now, but is bringing up his son supporting Arsenal, and I have no doubt that wherever I live in the future, I would raise my children supporting Arsenal too.

So many people make this point - how far down do you go?

If you're only supporting a League club or a top non-league club then that's still glory-hunting of sorts (albeit on a much smaller scale).

My Arsenal supporting is inherited through my father (and his father before him), although I've been to see numerous Exeter City and Southampton games.

I play for my most local team so I'm pretty much obliged to support it.
 
 
Real Madrid and Barcelona... Bayern might be an in-form team at the moment, but as it stands they aren't even top of the Bundesliga table (though they could potentially be if they win at Dortmund), and I simply don't think they're as good as Real Madrid.
 
 
I think, It'll be definitely Barca, and about RM I'm not sure, because they lost some points in a local championship. I think It's not good for team morale, and Bayern have a good local results. It'll be very interesting ! )))
 
 
 
I can see another Utd vs Barcelona final.

Chelsea arent as strong as they used to be.
Arsenal are trying to get back on track.
Madrid never make an impact in CL.

Utd are on fire and Barcelona are getting even stronger now with the new buys like Fabregas and Sanchez. With their strongest starting X, most of the time they win when it counts.

 

lol

I want Bayern Munich to reach the final, as they are one of only two teams i feel could stop Barcelona, along with RM. If they bought a few world class defenders, they would have such a good starting 11. Although there defence is questionable, they have a world class goalkeeper in Manuel Neuer, and i would like to see how they cope with the threat of Ronaldo/Benzema etc, as when they get going they can be unplayable, although RM have been rather inconsistent lately, dropping a lot of points. I want to see if Robben can rise to the occasion, much like he did against Man Utd when he scored that volley, and i want to see Gomez in action against a world class team. His scoring record is amazing, but its mainly restricted to the Bundesliga, although i think he is the second top scorer in the CL? Even so, they have had quite an easy running. Will be an interesting match for sure!

The same bayern who just bottled the league to borussia dortmund for the second year in a row. Forget about it madrid are through, remember all the talk of bayern being such a great team and dominating their league in september when they beat city, you aren't hearing that now despite how good their team is. Dortmund are good, but if bayern can't win a league when they are 10 points clear of a team that is nowhere near as strong as them on paper then they really won't be able to beat madrid. At least madrid have the excuse of barcelona won it if they lose the title and both teams will probably get around 90 points in a 38 week season.

Only way I see bayern winning it is because madrid don't know how to keep a clean sheet, so it could go down to away goals.

Bayern are inconsistent, that's why they lost the Bundesliga. Not because they are a poor team.  
 
 
 
 

Man city are inconsistent, that's why they lost the Premier league. Not because they are a poor team.  

 

You can say that for a lot of teams and sounds a lot like manchester city. Who are likely to be trophyless this season and are out of the champions league.

I never said bayern are a poor team. I just said they bottled it when it truly counted which I expect them to do against real madrid due to their inconsistency. They should have beaten dortmund with the team they had simple as. Plus they had a penalty and robben could have scored another chance. Bayern are inconsistent, madrid are more consistent, so I expect madrid to beat bayern.

Anyway, like I said, away goals will be crucial in the tie. Due to both defences not good at keeping clean sheets and how good both teams are at attacking. Reckon it'll be goals galore unless mourinho does that ultra defensive trick that he tries to do against barca referred by xavi as 'anti football.'

Close, but I see madrid winning it, only way I see bayern winning is by away goals. madrids midfield is stronger. Defence is stronger, goalkeepers are around the same level, strikers are around the same level. Also bare in mind madrid has better rotation options than bayern, if ribery is injured, they would have to use kroos on the wing. If ronaldo is injured, they could use ozil on the wing.

If gomez is injured, olic is there, but if benzema is injured, they have someone equal but different in higuain or even ronaldo as a makeshift. Dunno why people are comparing bayern to madrid, none of the subs in bayern would even make madrids bench. They have the task of keeping an injury free first team and playing them for 180 mins which is very unlikely.

Bayern shouldn't have beaten Dortmund "simple as".  

Dortmund have the better defence, midfield is probably even, Bayern have the better attack. Dortmund are also a team on the up, they have plenty of young talent. The only reason why they flopped in the CL is because all of their team has no European experience.

Overall, I would say bayern are the better team, besides defence. I'm not using the CL as a reason why. I know their midfield is good, but schweinsteigger, kroos, robben, ribery, muller are better than gotze, kagawa and the other midfield players. Gotze is not as good as ribery or robben, although I could say he's better than kroos and muller. Same for kagawa. I think bayerns midfield is better.

I'm not underrating dortmund. I know they're a good team, but I think that bayern have just bottled it. Given at the start of the season they didn't concede in like 10 matches or something ridiculous like that to then just bottle the league like this is unacceptable. I think dortmund will match bayern in a year or two's time at the rate dortmund are going though.
