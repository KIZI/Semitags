NEW YORK - Bryan Bly is a pen-wielding "robo- signer" at Nationwide Title
Clearing Inc., inking his name on an average 5,000 mortgage documents a day for
companies such as Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase.

Those are just the ones that cross his desk.

Nationwide Title employs a computer system that automatically inserts a copy of
Bly's signature on thousands of digital files that he never sees. The system
even affixes an electronic notary seal.

"The problem with the way these documents are created isn't because a computer
is used," said Gloria Einstein, a legal aid attorney in Green Cove Springs,
Fla., who deposed Bly in a case in a which her client faces foreclosure by a
unit of Deutsche Bank. "It's because an enterprise has decided to use a computer
to create a system where nobody is responsible for the information and the
decisions."

The rush to securitize more than $4 trillion of mortgages as U.S. home sales
peaked in 2005 and 2006 inundated loan servicers and contractors like Palm
Harbor, Fla.-based Nationwide Title that help them handle paperwork. Lawsuits
fighting some of the more than 4 million foreclosures since then have exposed
sloppy recordkeeping and raised questions about the validity of documents used
to seize properties.

Bly is just one of more than a dozen robo-signers deposed in the past two years
by lawyers for borrowers seeking to block foreclosures. Spurred by descriptions
in depositions of employees signing thousands of affidavits a week without
checking their accuracy as legally required, the attorneys general in all 50
states last month opened an investigation into whether banks and loan servicers
used faulty documents or improper practices to foreclose.

Nationwide Title, which has about 175 employees, provides document imaging,
tracking, retrieval, recording and processing on bulk loan transfers for
lenders, servicers and investors. It's the largest third-party processor of
mortgage assignments, handling more than 350,000 last year, Senior Vice
President Jeremy Pomerantz said in a telephone interview. The company also
prepares lien releases, which show that a mortgage has been paid off by the
borrower.

Assignments, which are usually recorded with county land record departments,
list the buyer and seller of a loan as it's sold or packaged with other loans
into a mortgage-backed security. Lawyers for homeowners are challenging the
legitimacy of the documents, which are relied on by lenders to show they have
the right to foreclose.

(While closely held Nationwide Title in the past offered a package of
foreclosure-specific services, it had just one client, Pomerantz said. The
company doesn't handle foreclosure affidavits - submitted by banks to assert
ownership of a loan when they've lost the promissory note or to show that
borrowers are in default - and often it doesn't know when clients are requesting
documents for defaulted loans, he said.)

Nationwide Title's proprietary system isn't entirely automated, said Erika
Lance, senior vice president of administration. Employees receive requests from
clients for lien releases and mortgage assignments, which are often sent in
batches of as many as 30,000. They review the information and images of loan
documents sent along with the request, and the information is keyed into the
computer system.

The computer system fills in the electronic assignments in the format and
wording each county requires, and places a signature and notary seal from a list
of employees approved by each bank. Bly and other signers are given a title at
the bank requesting the documents, such as "vice president" or "assistant
secretary," depending on what the individual counties require, Lance said.

Nationwide Title files documents with scanned signatures in the 10 percent of
counties in the U.S. that accept electronic mortgage assignments, including
those for cities such as Chicago, Miami and Seattle, according to Lance. She
said producing electronic signatures in bulk is common in the industry.

"The laws are catching up to what is occurring with documentation," she said.
"Electronic recording is an accepted method of document recording."

While the law allows for electronic signatures and seals on assignments and lien
releases, the signer must physically appear before the notary, and the notary
must affirm the signer's identity, that the signer is aware of what the document
is, and that the signer is willingly executing it, said Michael Robinson,
executive director of the National Notary Association based in Chatsworth,
California.

"The guiding principles behind it are the same as the guiding principles around
paper notarizations," he said.

Mark Ladd, a land-records technology consultant in Racine, Wis., said the
systems he's seen require that the signer acknowledge that he's read the
document and that the notary is physically present.

"The law requires that somebody review these documents themselves," Ladd said.
"The person who signs the document makes a statement that they read it."

Nationwide Title's Pomerantz declined to say whether the company's system
requires signers to affirm they have read the document. He said document
inspectors, a job sometimes performed by signers and notaries, review signatures
and seals on a computer monitor. The notaries know the identities of the signers
because they work in the same office, he said.

"The signature is required to authorize it," Pomerantz said. "The signature is
not testifying in any way that they prepared that or personally validated the
information. They rely on their staff to validate."

Missing or incomplete paperwork has forced lenders to routinely recreate
documents to show courts they have standing to seize properties, said Jim
Miller, the executive who oversaw foreclosure-processing operations at JPMorgan
Chase from 2005 to November 2008.

About a third of foreclosure files his teams handled were missing mortgage
assignments. Servicers would often write new assignments when judges requested
proof that the party seeking to repossess a property had the right to do so, he
said.

"What used to happen before the robo-signer issues is that you'd find out while
in the foreclosure process that assignments needed to be done, and you had time
to clean it up before the actual foreclosure solidified," Miller said in a
telephone interview.

At JPMorgan Chase, where Miller was managing director of the default group, the
company began fixing documentation prior to foreclosure more than two years ago
in response to court rulings requiring lenders to show evidence of owning the
loan before taking legal action, he said.

Miller is now an independent consultant for the mortgage- servicing industry
based in Dallas. Thomas Kelly, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan Chase,
declined to comment.

The issue for courts to decide is whether banks are seizing homes that they
never legally acquired, visiting Harvard Law professor Katherine Porter told a
Congressional Oversight Panel on Oct. 27.

The legal debate centers on whether assignments can be created to show transfers
between banks that happened years earlier, Porter said.

"The largest and most complex harm that may exist with the loans in default or
foreclosure today is that the paperwork for the loans was not transferred
correctly," Porter said. "I emphasize that what constitutes a correct transfer
is a gray area; we need more direction from courts and legislatures on this
subject."

Paper documents were turned into electronic files so that they could be moved
around quickly, and shortcuts were taken to accommodate multiple transactions,
said Alan White, a law professor at Valparaiso University in Indiana. Promissory
notes were endorsed in blank so that whichever company held it could claim
possession. And mortgages were sometimes assigned in blank.

The foreclosure crisis opened up the process to scrutiny, as banks claimed to
have lost thousands of promissory notes and were instead showing judges copies,
White said.

Nationwide Title's Lance said she has long recommended to corporate clients that
they keep their files clean and produce assignments as transfers happen. Many of
the assignments the company produces are for bulk sales from one bank to
another, she said.

"NTC has been put in the middle of this storm," she said.

Bly, 52, said he trusts the employees that have verified the assignments his
signature is appearing on - even though he doesn't know what those processes are
and never sees the document.

"If they check it, why do they need you, sir," Einstein, the attorney, asked Bly
in his July deposition.

"As a signer," he replied.
