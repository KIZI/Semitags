AFGLC CONFERENCE ON HELLENISM

The American Foundation for Greek Language and Culture (AFGLC), in
partnership with the
Interdisciplinary Centers for Hellenic Studies (ICHS) at the
University of South Florida (USF) and the Richard Stockton College of
NJ (RSCNJ), proudly announces a Conference on
"The Hellenic Legacy through the Ages," which will take place on
March 7-8, 2008 at the USF campus.
The Conference will bring together academicians, scholars, and
interested individuals who will address

a) the long-term influence of Hellenism in the world, and

b) the on-going and projected educational contributions of the
Interdisciplinary Centers--which AFGLC has established in institutions
of higher learning.

The cost of the Conference will be underwritten by the well-known
philanthropists and AFGLC benefactors George and Margo Behrakis.
