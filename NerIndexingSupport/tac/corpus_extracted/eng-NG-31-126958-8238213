Wow! You'd think that with it a double-header, they might have wanted
to let the game end so they could get some rest ;-)

Very impressive (though it would be more impressive if it weren't
against the Orioles...)

Cool link ... Although there was one glaring mistake ...

"The last two times a team had two guys
with seven-plus RBIs in a game before
Jarrod Saltalamacchia and Ramon Vazquez
did:
Aug. 19, 1962: Yankees 21 at Royals 7
Mickey Mantle - 7
Elston Howard - 8"

In 1962, there was no Kansas City Royals.  It was the Kansas City Athletics
(now the Oakland A's).

"In this game: June 29, 1897 Chicago Colts (now Cubs) scored 36
against the Louisville Colonels, won 36-7. Foul balls did not count as
strikes, so it was "easier" to score runs."

So, you could foul-your-little-head-off, and never get a strike
called against you!
That rule is mistaken on the year cited, which had changed by
then.  Fouls are strikes starting in 1894 and since it was mentioned at the
link below, and not mentioning any change after
( http://www.19cbaseball.com/rules-3.html ), it also seems to appy to non-bunt
attempts, unless they somehow left out that distinction in a future change.

Another tidbit on the old-time rules (1871), that favored the
batter, said he (the 'striker' in the nomenclature of the day) could call
for a 'low' or 'high' ball!
That would have been fun to see today, especially if the pitcher
didn't give the batter what he ordered, and the 'striker' throws a hissy
fit!
That rule lasted until changed in 1884.

Bats were allowed to have one flat side from 1887 until 1892.

Fascinating stuff on the evolution of the greatest game of them
all!
