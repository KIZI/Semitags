I believe the author of this article makes a common mistake most people make. He assumes that the outcome is evidence of the hypothesis when in fact the conclusion must include what would have occurred had the tax cuts not taken place. Econometrics attempts to isolate variables to answer this question. The author may be correct, I don't know, though I suspect that growth would have been lower had the Bush tax cuts not been implemented.

However, he does lay out the data.

 
Those tax cuts passed in 2001 amid big promises about what they would do for the economy. What followed? The decade with the slowest average annual growth since World War II. Amazingly, that statement is true even if you forget about the Great Recession and simply look at 2001-7.

The competition for slowest growth is not even close, either. Growth from 2001 to 2007 averaged 2.39 percent a year (and growth from 2001 through the third quarter of 2010 averaged 1.66 percent). The decade with the second-worst showing for growth was 1971 to 1980  the dreaded 1970s  but it still had 3.21 percent average growth.

The picture does not change if you instead look at five-year periods. Heres a chart ranking five-year periods over the past 50 years, in descending order of average annual growth:

 

...

Is there good evidence the tax cuts persuaded more people to join the work force (because they would be able to keep more of their income)? Not really. The labor-force participation rate fell in the years after 2001 and has never again approached its record in the year 2000.

Is there evidence that the tax cuts led to a lot of entrepreneurship and innovation? Again, no. The rate at which start-up businesses created jobs fell during the past decade.

The theory for why tax cuts should create growth and jobs is a strong one. When people are allowed to keep more of each dollar they earn, they are likely to work longer and harder. The uncertainty is the magnitude of this effect. With everything else thats happening in a $15 trillion economy, how large of an effect on growth do tax cuts have?

The data does not lie. The tax cuts were a costly, shallowy thought-out solution for the economic problems that existed immediately following 9/11. I really wish people would stop being afraid of taxes. Revenue from taxes go to funding higher education, building roads and protecting our borders (amongst other benefits). Because of this extension, the average working taxpayer will get to keep a whopping $50 (rough estimate) in their paycheck. Is this really worth the price tag associated with this extension for the betterment of the health of our national economy?
 
 
Lets not forget the nearly 5 trillion in excess spending / debt that Bush did.
It had to cause some economic growth.
 
 
Hmm. Kennedy's tax cuts created growth. So did Reagan's. So did Clinton's Republican budgets.

I'd say Bush's record is pretty good for wartime.
 
 
Bullshit.

Remember your meme that WWII saved the US economy and not the new deal?

You cant even keep the republican lies straight
 
 
The new deal helped us to win WW2.
The electricity from new deal hydro projects was used to refine aluminum and uranium.
And many more aspects as well. Roads to transport war materials on, etc.

that's all bullshit. You assume the idiotic, which is that tax rates were the sole causative driver of the economy.
 
 
 
Bullshit.

Remember your meme that WWII saved the US economy and not the new deal?

 

WWII did end the G Depression. Or rather the full employment of total war.

actually more than full employment. Women entered the labor force in significant numbers for the first time.
 
 
Then how could the revere idea that war hurts the economy be right?

Good point, infrastructure is alwasy a good idea
 
 
 
Then how could the revere idea that war hurts the economy be right?

 

Well the worst thing about Iraq and Afgansitan economic wise was a tax cut instead of a tax increase to fund the wars. That coupled with our already far to high debt level.
 
 
The NYT article is a load of simplistic propaganda. Economic performance is affected by more than tax rates. Spending, Monetary Policy, and the Rule of Law are equally important.

Unfavorable trends:

 

 

 

 

 
 
 
 
Then how could the revere idea that war hurts the economy be right?

 

It is almost impossible for Revere to be right, but it does happen!

War is both good and bad for the economy. In the early phases it is usually pretty helpful, but the long term costs are counterproductive. It's hard to see this when you layer the long and short term impacts of war upon previous and previous wars.

But the same is true for deficit spending which is where war gains it's benefits. Spending tomorrow's money today always has an upfront benefit, followed by a long hangover.
 
 
So we now have around 4-5 million more govt employees than we do in goods producing industries?
Lets outsource some more folks.
 
 
How about we shrink government so that it doesn't exceed expected tax receipts by 25% instead.
 
 
And lets not forget that several of those goods producing industtires products are purchased by the govt.
 
 
Toro, econometric analysis relies on several things a certain poster you know has objected to in other contexts:

The EMH or no money left on the table as in no one has ever seen coins or bills on the street.

Gaussian distribution, no one ever makes money from Black Swans or fat tails.

Econometrics does a decent job of explaining what has happened ex-post. Forecasting is okay as long as the system is stable. It doesn't tell you what can happen when a system isn't stable. That is a problem with general equilibrium economics.

Since neither of us believe in general equilibrium, you've said as much in other posts, let's move beyond that. The welfare state is based on envy and sloth and possibly public health concerns: dead bodies are a health hazard. Since diseases do not stop at borders or community gates and poor living conditions breed disease some sort of safety net is needed. What is not needed is some social "justice" tax code but neither of the majors is willing to confront that issue.
 
 
Were the Bush Tax Cuts Good for Growth?

Depends on how you feel about taxes. I personally feel we pay more than enough in all kinds of taxes - especially Federal income tax. Regardless of your station in life, everybody's tax rate should be the same thing. You don't measure growth by what the government takes away from you. You measure growth by what you do with your own resources. Not necessarily in a business sense. Tax cuts give you a better financial standard of living. If your taxes are cut by $1,000 a year then you have $1,000 a year to do something good for your lifestyle. No matter how you look at that, it's growth. It is an investment into your own well-being. Call it selfish or anything else you would like to call it. I earn my money so I am only interested in my welfare. If you want a better station in life, try earning it for a change instead of success being given to you from the government from taxes they collected from somebody else. There is something to be said for personal responsibility.
 
 
 
The data does not lie. The tax cuts were a costly, shallowy thought-out solution for the economic problems that existed immediately following 9/11. I really wish people would stop being afraid of taxes. Revenue from taxes go to funding higher education, building roads and protecting our borders (amongst other benefits). Because of this extension, the average working taxpayer will get to keep a whopping $50 (rough estimate) in their paycheck. Is this really worth the price tag associated with this extension for the betterment of the health of our national economy?

 

Those tax cuts "created or saved" a cajillion jobs. Obama would have been taken over a much worse economy without them.

The Bush 2001 tax cuts didn't work, so in 2003 there was a second round of tax cuts, increasing the deficit yet again. In 2004, fully 3 years after the mild 9 month recession of 2001, the Greenspan fed dropped short term interest rates to a 40 year low of 1%, and that irresponsible behavior during an expansion (tepid though it was, it was expanding), allowed the 2% teaser rates on subprime loans and played a major role in ushering in an over-heated housing market that then collapsed in 2006-2008.
 
 
 
Hmm. Kennedy's tax cuts created growth. So did Reagan's. So did Clinton's Republican budgets.

I'd say Bush's record is pretty good for wartime.

 

Kennedy's tax cut were applied at the end of the recession with the economy already on the upward swing.

Reagan had no tax cuts as he raised taxes almost to the extent of his cuts.

Clinton raised taxes and a boom ensued nevertheless.

The Bush tax cuts were an unmitigated disaster.

40% of the stimulus was tax cuts and no one noticed.

Hell of a record wouldn't you say?

A lot depends on what kind of country you want. Obviously you don't want much of a country as taxes pay for all those things that allow business to make money and contribute to a educated, stable workforce.

Of course, if you are rich enough you don't give a shit as you can afford all those things as you live in your gated community, free from any collective responsibility.

And how many jobs was offshored during the Bush presidency?
I guess you could say he created many jobs, in other country's.

No the deficits were breaking records, stop lying. And the jobless recovery was creating a tiny fraction of the jobs created under Clinton.

Unemployment was low under Bush because folks voluntarily dropped from the workforce because they thought they had an extra $10 trillion in real estate equity.

NOT!

Bush's unemployment was 6% at its worst. Shit, I'd take that.

 
 
 
In 1913 the Federal reserve, taxes, control & laws brought the USA sweeping communism & the Great Depression.

In 1913 the lowest tax bracket paid 1% rate & the top tax bracket paid 7% rate.
by 1918 the lowest tax bracket paid 6% rate & the top tax bracket paid 77% rate.
Taxes & the Great Depression Peaked in 1944.
By 1944 the lowest tax bracket paid 23% rate & the top tax bracket paid 94% rate.
After 1945 tax rates dropped & price controls lifted causing the economy to recover, not the war as myth has it.
By 1946 the lowest tax bracket paid 20% rate & the top tax bracket paid 91% rate.
In 1964 the Kennedy tax cut the lowest tax bracket to 16% rate & the top tax bracket to 70% rate & prosperity made a comeback.
In 1982 the Reagan tax cut set off the largest economic boom the world had ever seen.

Any and all money made honestly ideally should stay in the pockets, there are three exceptions to that rule:

The suppression of malum per se crime to keep criminal syndicates from taking over.

Formed military units with logistical support to deter invasion.

Public health to deal with non-human bad actors.

Any and all laws or taxes that do not deal with one of those three things should be abolished.

I like it! a 100% dedicated tax system.

We could end all the debate over entitlements by allowing them all and making them voluntary agreements between a citizen and a GOVERNMENT CORPORATION.

I would add infrastucture to the list but that could be a function of the states.

The problem tho is that, this being the economics forum, is that states with powerful central governments have huge advantages when it comes to cultivating industry. And industry is the key to defense and wealth creation. The two core missions of government.

Libertarian paternalism with opt out has a large body of literature with Michael Shermer being one of the better known names. Scandinavia has been experimenting with it at the margins (organ donation in Denmark seems to be the most successful) and seems to work well.

Well infrastructure is logistical train which is why the army corps of engineers handles it.
 
 
 
Lets not forget the nearly 5 trillion in excess spending / debt that Bush did.
It had to cause some economic growth.

 

Where was it? The graph shows miserably little bang for the buck.

Also should you include Bush's last budget (the one with the trillion buck deficit) you will find his debt increase to be more like 6 !/2 trillion.

A high price to pay for almost no growth.

Bullshit.

Remember your meme that WWII saved the US economy and not the new deal?

You cant even keep the republican lies straight

 

The WWII war did not save the economy. The tax cut in 1946 & the baby boom saved the economy. The Kennedy & Reagan tax cuts also created enormous booms. The high taxes imposed on this country by you Communist in 1918 caused the Great Depression. There was never a Great Depression in this country prior to the federal reserve, taxes & regulations.
 
 
If Obama caves to his base and Pelosi, and decides to change his mind on the tax cuts. you will REALLY see just how good the Bush tax cuts were, for the economy.
 
 
Tax cuts do stimulate just like interest rate cuts & regulation cuts. Like most stimulus it wears off after a while & may lead to other problems like bubbles & inflation. In order to keep the economy going you must have sound economic fundamentals & foreign policy.

I would add infrastucture to the list but that could be a function of the states.

The problem tho is that, this being the economics forum, is that states with powerful central governments have huge advantages when it comes to cultivating industry. And industry is the key to defense and wealth creation. The two core missions of government.

 

Well infrastructure is logistical train which is why the army corps of engineers handles it.

 

In the above two quotes you have the reason why libertarianism has never been tried, anywhere anytime. It is just too stupid.

Well, maybe at the hunter/gatherer level.

 

Sticking with the same program for two centuries, secure in the knowledge that the pre-revolutionary French Philosophes figured it all out is bright? Sure thing, good thing for you that we are still in the 18th century.
 
 
 
 
Bullshit.

Remember your meme that WWII saved the US economy and not the new deal?

You cant even keep the republican lies straight

 

The WWII war did not save the economy. The tax cut in 1946 & the baby boom saved the economy. The Kennedy & Reagan tax cuts also created enormous booms. The high taxes imposed on this country by you Communist in 1918 caused the Great Depression. There was never a Great Depression in this country prior to the federal reserve, taxes & regulations.

 

The boom during WWII was much bigger than the expansions under Reagan and Kennedy.

 

In fact, the expansions under Reagan and Kennedy look like standard post-war expansions.
 
 
Here is another article on the OP.

 
What impact did the Bush tax cuts have on economic growth?

The evidence is not favorable. For example, according to this Census report (see table A1), median household income in 2007, adjusted for inflation, was lower than it was in 2000. And as the non-partisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities reports, based upon data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment growth was particularly weak, “with employment and wage and salary growth … lower than in any previous post-World War II expansion. Employment grew at an average annual rate of only 0.9 percent from November 2001 to September 2007, as compared with an average of 2.5 percent for the comparable periods of other post-World War II expansions. In addition, real wages and salaries grew at a 1.8 percent average annual rate in the 2001-2007 expansion, as compared with a 3.8 percent average annual rate for the comparable periods of other post-World War II expansions.”

Thus, there is little evidence to support that the Bush tax cuts had a significant effect on growth. In addition, contrary to the argument that the tax cuts would pay for themselves being made at the time the tax cuts were enacted, the deficit ballooned as a result of the tax cuts.

I don't want to sound flippant. but who cares?? Seriously, it is our money not the government's.

I believe the more important questions are: why does the government spend every penny they collect and more, regardless of tax rates? Why is the fed gov't unable to collect more than 18-19% of GDP regardless of tax rates? What level of taxation is fair? Is 35% of my income not enough? Should the government really take 50% of all that I earn above a certain amount?? What is my incentive to earn more income if the incremental income I work so hard to earn is confiscated by incompetent boobs and spend on more entitlements?

I am taxed enough - especially when I look at all the taxes and fees government is taking: fed income tax, state income tax, Social Security and Medicare (employee half and employer!),property taxes, car taxes, fees for every utility, gas tax, sales tax....it is at least 50% of my income.

Tax rates are not the problem, spending is. Cut spending. Cut entitlements. Cut defense. Cut it all. Do it now.

Disagree at the margin.

Some things such as the Fed, FHA and the GSEs should be eliminated in their entirety.

Other things should be cut overtime such as index SS and Medicare to life expectancy and then push for greater life expectancy and health.

Other things should be spent differently. Get better transport of troops and equipment and relocate the troops to US soil. Pumping up other people's GDP with US tax dollars is a greater indirect expense than the defense budget.

Let the UN or other international bodies outlaw the use of food subsidies that reduce food output. That is a twofer that would reduce spending and encourage export growth.

More important than the relative size of the boom is GDP data from the 40s. GDP doubled in 3 years (40-43) whereas historically real GDP doubles every 10 years (7 times in the last 70 years):

The tax cuts were fantastic for growth - in China. All those companies moving to a country without reliable clean water or electricity? Where did the money come from to move all those companies there and build up all that infrastructure? From 2001 to 2008, more than 2.4 million. How many factories and companies employed 2.4 million? There's a few hundred where I work. How many where you work?

WWII did end the G Depression. Or rather the full employment of total war.

 

That was then, this is now. During WWII we became the industrial giant of the world and everything was "made in USA".

This held true through the Vietnam war. It is not the case today. Our manufacturing base is no longer sufficient to supply our ongoing wars. We gave it all top China and third world countries. Today war spending does not produce much employment...and less prosperity.

And oh yes, we emerged from WWII with a debt that exceeded our GNP.
 
 
 
The data does not lie. The tax cuts were a costly, shallowy thought-out solution for the economic problems that existed immediately following 9/11. I really wish people would stop being afraid of taxes. Revenue from taxes go to funding higher education, building roads and protecting our borders (amongst other benefits). Because of this extension, the average working taxpayer will get to keep a whopping $50 (rough estimate) in their paycheck. Is this really worth the price tag associated with this extension for the betterment of the health of our national economy?

 

The tax cuts were a Bush Administration goal. Before the 9/11 attacks, the need for the tax cuts was that we had enough tax revenues and we needed to give back to those who earned it.

After the attacks, we needed to stimulate the economy. Opposite goal with the same prescription. Interesting, no?

The conditions and the effects and the economic theory were all rubbish. W felt he could be re-elected if he cut taxes. He did. He was. Mission Accomplished.

41 promised to not increase taxes. He did. He wasn't. Lesson learned by the younger.
