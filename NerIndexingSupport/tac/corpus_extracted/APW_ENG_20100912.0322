Captain Michael Klinger hit five sixes in his 78 from 48 balls to take South Australia Redbacks to 178 for six in their Champions League Twenty20 game against South Africa's Highveld Lions on Sunday.

Klinger led his team's batting effort in the Group B match at SuperSport Park after the Australians had been asked to bat first and struggled with the pace of the pitch in the early overs.

Daniel Harris (13) and Graham Manou (12) fell cheaply before opener Klinger found a helpful partner in Australia international Callum Ferguson.

The pair combined for a 97-run partnership in under 10 overs to boost the Redbacks' hopes of starting their Champions League campaign with victory.

Ferguson hit seven fours and made 47 from 27 balls.
