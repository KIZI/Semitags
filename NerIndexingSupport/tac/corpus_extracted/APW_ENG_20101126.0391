Bernard Matthews, whose investment in 20 eggs laid the foundation for Britain's biggest turkey business, has died at age 80.

Matthews' company announced Friday that he had died a day earlier at his home.

The company's advertising slogan -- "bootiful" -- stemmed from Matthews' Norfolk dialect, and was drummed in to the nation's consciousness through television advertising.

He started the business in 1950 with 20 eggs and a second-hand incubator. Three years later he bought a derelict country home, Great Witchingham Hall, where he and his wife raised turkeys in the bedrooms. It is still the company headquarters.
