I know they're ranked #1.
I know the Gators just lost to an un-ranked Auburn at home.
I know they have (possibly superior) speed and talent.

The Gators are going to win.

Even though I predicted before the season that LSU would be UF's only loss
(twice).

Auburn messed that up for me, so the Gators are going to win tomorrow night
to make the world rite again.

Unless Mianderson bets money on them.

Then the Gators are absolutely snot-fucked.

Please excuse me... and please pardon the profanity.  I thought I was in the
football newsgroup when I posted this (profanity is not only welcome there,
it's expected).  I've attempted to cancel the post, but as we all know, that
doesn't always work.  I just had a minor surgical procedure done earlier
this afternoon and perhaps the anesthetic hasn't worn off my brane yet,
sorry.

What are you talking about?  And why is this not labeled OT?

While I feel your pain, I almost think I'd have more respect for you
if you just shouted, "I JUST FELT LIKE BEING *BAD* OKAY??!!"

Hope you're "brane" is feeling better soon.  ;-)
