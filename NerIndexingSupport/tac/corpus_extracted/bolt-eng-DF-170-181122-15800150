The fire broke out on April 2, just before sunset, in the Federation Tower that planned to be Europe's tallest building, in Moscow, Russia. The Tower is located in Moscow City, a cluster of modern high-rise office buildings. The flames were over 250 meter (880 feet) tall. The tower, when completed, is to be 360 meter (1150 feet) tall.

Did anyone add a few hundred gallons of jet fuel to the flames? If not, no comparison.

Nor the destruction of several pillars due to violent explosion and impact of jumbo jets. But don't confuse the troofers.
 
 
No long span steel trusses!

why jet fuel burns no hotter than a regular fire in wtc 7 bud
 
 
 
No long span steel trusses!

 

none of those in wtc 7

wtc 7 apparently fell when fire alone caused the failure of a single column

Impact adds to the jet fuel explosion, YES.

the impact jet fuel line to explain the complete destruction of the towers is nonsense..but no jet hit wtc 7 and no jet fuel

Was there an initial impact? You can bet your last euro that the Russians ain't about to put a crane on the top floor....because the whole freaking burned out thing would come crashing down.

Why didn't you point out that the fire was only on the top floor, and was fought by fire helicopters? Is this because that would have ruined the false point you were trying to make?

 

 

 
 
 
Europe's current tallest building stands in the same development - the 302m (990ft) City of Capitals building, while another block under construction there - the Mercury Tower - will reach 332m (1089ft).
Russian news reports said the fire engulfed 300 square metres (3200 square feet) at its height as the blaze tore through the 65th to the 67th floor.
Firefighters were forced to climb the stairs to fight the fire because the building's lifts are not yet in service, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
No injuries were reported.
In August 2000, Moscow's 540-metre (1,771-foot) Ostankino broadcasting tower, once the world's tallest freestanding structure, caught fire and burned for 26 hours.

More like a few tens of THOUSANDS of gallons of Jet-A. Also the design and construction of the buildings is vastly different. This is like comparing an elephant with an aircraft carrier.

FAIL.

no jet fuel in wtc 7 clown head and btw 10000 U.S. gallons (38000 L) of jet fuel mostly consumed in the initial fireball, hit between the 93rd and 99th floors of the North Tower

So the roof burned off. Not quite the same as the middle being burned out along with and accelerant.

But good try.

Actually, I'd call it a piss poor attempt.

"Catching fire" isn't the same as two planes fully loaded with jet fuel crashing into a building at a high rate of speed and then EXPLODING like a bomb. The impact of the planes alone probably compromised the structure then you had an explosion that no doubt did further damage and then a very hot burn. That's three catestrophic events happening in the space of a few minutes as opposed to a building catching fire and just burning. You're comparing apples to oranges.

It was probably hit with flying debris when the towers collasped. Maybe the foundation was compromised by a few tons of building shaking the ground so close to the building. Most buildings on the east coast are not built for the ground to shake under them. Those buildings coming down must have been like an earthquake to the surrounding buildings. You also don't know if WTC 7 had any unknown structural flaws that when put under stress, would cause the building to collaspe. Then again I'm sure those who designed WTC 7 never even considered two massive buildings collasping in close proximity to their building,who would think of that? You're chasing ghosts.
