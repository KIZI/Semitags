Spain's intelligence chief announced his resignation Thursday after press
allegations that he used public money for private hunting and fishing trips.

Alberto Saiz, head of the National Intelligence Centre (CNI), denounced the
"false" accusations, but said he was resigning to avoid harming both the CNI and
the Spanish government.

Saiz, a civilian, was replaced as Spain's intelligence chief by General Felix
Sanz Roldan, a former military chief of staff, after five years in the post.

In recent weeks he has been the target of accusations from the centre-right
newspaper El Mundo that he used CNI funds to finance private hunting and fishing
trips to Mexico, Mali and Senegal as well as for work on his house.

El Mundo also charged that he had submitted some of his agents to lie detector
tests to try and identify the source of the leaks.
