In 1948, Israel's founding fathers issued a manifesto declaring among other things that the new state would uphold the equality of all its citizens, without distinction of race or creed.

Six decades later that is not a principal that many of Israel's Arab citizens - who make up about 20 per cent of the population - believe applies to them, especially in matters involving law and order.

In his film, One Law for All?, filmmaker Tony Stark investigates whether Israeli Arabs are regularly the victims of legal double standards.

Treatment of minorities is always a problem for any democratic state. Israel tries. It doesn't help that much of the minority population wants to kill off the majority population.

I don't believe I would consider al Jazera a valid source.

Given the conditions here when I was growing up (not in my neck of the woods but in other places) Israel can say they are doing quite well

Getting past the usual stupid, mindless blast of the messenger, What do you feel is incorrect in this report?
 
 
Last I checked 13 Arabs were in the Knesset. Last I checked Arabs are the only people in Israel allowed to avoid mandatory military service. Last I checked arab areas of Israel have Sharia law.

Ya sounds just like they are oppressed indeed.

You have no defense so resort to this? Explain how they are even in the Knesset if they are so oppressed? How they have Sharia law in their own towns and villages if they are so oppressed? Arabs in Israel are more free then any Arab in the Middle East.

One of those Knesset Arabs was second in his block and it was not an Arab block.
 
 
 
Arabs in Israel are more free then any Arab in the Middle East.

 

Arabs in Egypt, Lebanon, Kuwaite, and all thru the Gulf, have as much freedom, or even more, than arabs in Israel.  
 
 
 
Last I checked 13 Arabs were in the Knesset.

 

There are always "Uncle Tom's" in every society.

Heck, there were even blacks who volunteered and fought for the Confederacy

You are skirting the question. What laws were introduced by Arabs that passed in the Knesset. Could I guess NONE!

Christians and Jews have more rights in Palestine than do Muslims and Christians in Israel.

BTW, a Christian was elected to the PLC (parliament) on the Hamas ticket.

OK, so you will avoid the Question. I was just curious as to how effective they are in that position.

How about :

Christians and Jews have more rights in Palestine than do Muslims and Christians in Israel.

BTW, a Christian was elected to the PLC (parliament) on the Hamas ticket.

Any comment on these issues?

In 1948 the Arab tried to kill every Jew. Since then there have been genocidal rants and attacks by all Israel's neighbors. The Israeli Arab population mostly sympathizes with those calls. Not all! The Druze, Circassians and Bedouins (and some Christians) all fought along side the Jews in '48 in great numbers. In fact the Druze and Circassians serve mandatory conscriptions in the military and the Bedouins make up a nice sized class of enlisted men to the IDF.

Nevertheless any survey will show that most consider themselves Palestinians. Go to many Israeli Arab "settlements" just beyond the greenline in Israel and you will see places in Israel Jews can't go safely. Places where Palestinian and even Hamas flags fly. I have seen them with my own eyes!

Therefore, many loyal citizens of the state are not going to like people who will take from the state and show high amount of disloyality, which could amount to treason in any other country. This is a problem in many societies. Ask the French Muslims and Africans how they are treated! Heck they had an enormous (LA City type) roit over it. It is only natural for patriots of a country to not want to help people who spit on your country every chance they get!

That stated. Arab Israelis have all the rights Jews have (Note: There is a clear distinction btw Israeli Arabs inside Israel and Palestinians in the WB and Gaza who are not Israeli Arabs and not citizens of Israel).
(1) Full rights to work in any job they choose.
(2) They have full rights to own property.
(3) They have full rights to practice their religion and build mosques. Heck the most important place of Judaism, the Temple Mount, can only be worshipped by Muslims not Jews.
(4) Full right to open and run a business.
(5) Full access of the courts to address their grievances.
(6) Full right to petition the government
(7) Full rights of free speech (which many of them use arrogantly).
(8) Full rights to free press (which there are many Arabic newspapers in Israel).
(9) Full right to join the military.
(10) Full right to free education.
(11) Full rights to universal health care.
(12) Full rights to apply for and receive welfare.
(13) Full rights to freedom of movement.
(14) Full right to VOTE! One of the only middle east and north African countries where Muslims actually get to vote for meaningful political heads. One of the only countries Muslim women can vote in the middle east and North Africa.
(15) Arabs can and do serve within government. Hell Israel has more Muslims in their government, than the entire Arab (excluding Lebanon, but not for long) and Persian world has Christian, Jews, Buddhadist or Hindus combined in their. Israel has Arab town mayors, government workers, Parliament member (I believe 14 right now) and even Supreme Court Justices (there have been 2)!
(16) Etc.
The only difference is Jews have to serve in the army, Arabs have free choice of whether to serve or not.

Is there discrimination, without a doubt, as there is in every country, including Europe and the US. However, although wrong, with the fact that the vast majority of Arab Israelis sympathize with Israel's arch-enemy, it is more than understandable.

Heck compared to every other Middle East, African and hell even most Asian country, Israel is far better place for minorities to live.
 
 
Yea, IsraHell is a real paradice for the goyim  
 
 
 
 
Arabs in Israel are more free then any Arab in the Middle East.

 

Arabs in Egypt, Lebanon, Kuwaite, and all thru the Gulf, have as much freedom, or even more, than arabs in Israel.  

 

PLEASE, with state controlled press, they have no voice. Discenters disappear with regularity, no free speech there. Imagine what happens to someone that speak out against Hezbollah. They are dead the next dead. No free speech either. Do they have the freedom to practice religion? Lebanese Arab Christians used to be the majority. Chalk a great chunk up to Arabs breeding like rabbits, but they Christian population have dropped to 20%. A good chunk is discrimination, violence, pograms and Islamist intolerance of others.

Kuwait having freedom. This is new. Last I saw Kuwait was a monarchy!

Face douche bag you failed, like everything you do!

Totally different. Being members of the national legislature is the same as being in charge. There are several political parties in Israel; whenever they have a disagreement each side makes deals with the Arabs in the legislature, giving those 13 more influence than their raw numbers might otherwise indicate.
Do you know nothing about politics?

Living under a monarchy doesn't mean you don't have freedoms.

The people of Egypt have as many freedoms as your beloved IsraHell.

Fine I will go off your little blanket statement of freedom for all in Egypt (although like everything you do you provide no proof), yet there is no way in HELL that Christians are NOT discriminated against. Churches are firebombed, Christian converts are murder, women not wearing the hijab are attacked, christians are discriminated against, etc.

Freedom of religion, (if you are Sunni in the wrong place, or Shiite in the wrong place....?) freedom of speech, freedom to question the country's rulers, the right to participated in semi honest elections? They got any of that?

The ABL transfered property owner rights to a Custodian of Absentee Property. It made him liable to the real owner for the value, but prohibited the return of his land. Israeli law assured that Palestinians remaining in Israel, relocated and declared "Absentees," no longer were rightful owners of their own property.

The Development Authority (DA) was established as an independent body to buy, sell, lease, exchange, repair, build, develop and/or cultivate seized property. Henceforth, only transactions between Jews or a Jewish entity were allowed.

Over two years ago, this writer addressed the plight of tens of thousands of Bedouin Israeli citizens in so-called "unrecognized villages" in the Galilee and Negev desert, declared illegal under Israeli law. They're "unrecognized" because their inhabitants are considered internal refugees, forced to flee during Israel's "War of Independence," and were prohibited from returning when it ended.

Existing communities are circumscribed on a map with blue lines around them. Areas inside can be developed. Those outside cannot. Jewish communities have great latitude to expand. Palestinian ones do not. Their land was zoned as agricultural, meaning construction is forbidden. As a result, entire communities became "unrecognized," and all structures in them illegal, including 95% of those built before the 1965 law. They may be demolished and their inhabitants displaced at the whim of Israeli officials to make it available for exclusive Jewish use.

Currently, existing "unrecognized villages" are denied essential municipal services, including clean water, electricity, roads, transport, sanitation, education, healthcare, postal and telephone service, refuse removal, and more because under the Planning and Construction Law they're illegal. As a result:

-- only Bedouins with wells have clean water;

-- few have healthcare;

-- many have no bathrooms, and permits aren't issued to build them;

-- only residents with private generators have electricity, enough only for lighting;

-- no village is connected to the main road network;

-- some villages are fenced in prohibiting their residents from accessing their traditional lands;

-- most children are denied education; and

-- when home demolitions are ordered, Palestinians must do it themselves or be fined for contempt of court and face up to a year in prison; they may also be assessed when Israeli bulldozers do it, effectively penalizing them twice.

(15) Arabs can and do serve within government. Hell Israel has more Muslims in their government, than the entire Arab (excluding Lebanon, but not for long) and Persian world has Christian, Jews, Buddhadist or Hindus combined in their. Israel has Arab town mayors, government workers, Parliament member (I believe 14 right now) and even Supreme Court Justices (there have been 2)!
(16) Etc.
The only difference is Jews have to serve in the army, Arabs have free choice of whether to serve or not.

Is there discrimination, without a doubt, as there is in every country, including Europe and the US. However, although wrong, with the fact that the vast majority of Arab Israelis sympathize with Israel's arch-enemy, it is more than understandable.

Heck compared to every other Middle East, African and hell even most Asian country, Israel is far better place for minorities to live.

 

The ABL transfered property owner rights to a Custodian of Absentee Property. It made him liable to the real owner for the value, but prohibited the return of his land. Israeli law assured that Palestinians remaining in Israel, relocated and declared "Absentees," no longer were rightful owners of their own property.

The Development Authority (DA) was established as an independent body to buy, sell, lease, exchange, repair, build, develop and/or cultivate seized property. Henceforth, only transactions between Jews or a Jewish entity were allowed.

Over two years ago, this writer addressed the plight of tens of thousands of Bedouin Israeli citizens in so-called "unrecognized villages" in the Galilee and Negev desert, declared illegal under Israeli law. They're "unrecognized" because their inhabitants are considered internal refugees, forced to flee during Israel's "War of Independence," and were prohibited from returning when it ended.

Existing communities are circumscribed on a map with blue lines around them. Areas inside can be developed. Those outside cannot. Jewish communities have great latitude to expand. Palestinian ones do not. Their land was zoned as agricultural, meaning construction is forbidden. As a result, entire communities became "unrecognized," and all structures in them illegal, including 95% of those built before the 1965 law. They may be demolished and their inhabitants displaced at the whim of Israeli officials to make it available for exclusive Jewish use.

Currently, existing "unrecognized villages" are denied essential municipal services, including clean water, electricity, roads, transport, sanitation, education, healthcare, postal and telephone service, refuse removal, and more because under the Planning and Construction Law they're illegal. As a result:

-- only Bedouins with wells have clean water;

-- few have healthcare;

-- many have no bathrooms, and permits aren't issued to build them;

-- only residents with private generators have electricity, enough only for lighting;

-- no village is connected to the main road network;

-- some villages are fenced in prohibiting their residents from accessing their traditional lands;

-- most children are denied education; and

-- when home demolitions are ordered, Palestinians must do it themselves or be fined for contempt of court and face up to a year in prison; they may also be assessed when Israeli bulldozers do it, effectively penalizing them twice.
