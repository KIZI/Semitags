A pilot with Britain's Royal Air Force (RAF) and a school-age cadet died Sunday
after their training plane collided mid-air with a civilian glider, the Ministry
of Defence said.

Police confirmed the crash in Oxfordshire, northwest of London, adding that the
glider pilot parachuted to safety and was "safe and well".

A ministry statement said: "An RAF Grob Tutor aircraft has crashed following a
suspected mid-air collision with a civilian glider at around 1400 (1300 GMT)
today, June 14, 2009."

It added: "We can confirm that the pilot and passenger were killed. The pilot
was RAF and the passenger a CCF (combined cadet force) cadet."

The CCF is a military-sponsored youth organisation programme, and typically
involves students attending high school.

Earlier, police said they had been called to the site near Abingdon and
confirmed two people from the light aircraft had died.

"The pilot of the glider parachuted to safety and is safe and well," they added
in a statement.

The Ministry of Defence said it would conduct a "thorough investigation" into
the crash, but said it was too early to comment on the probable cause.
