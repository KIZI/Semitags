A Russian police officer beat a man to death in Saint Petersburg, authorities
said Thursday, amid a growing public concern over abuse of power and corruption
among the country's law enforcers.

The investigative committee of the prosecutor general's office said in a
statement that it was investigating the death of a man who died earlier this
month after a policeman "kicked him in the stomach multiple times."

After the victim was released from a police station, he sought medical help and
was placed in hospital, where he died from the inflicted injuries," the
statement said.

The statement was the second official announcement of a death at the hands of
police this week.

Three Moscow police officers were detained on suspicion of severely beating a
man from the breakaway Georgian republic of Abkhazia who died shortly
afterwards, officials said earlier this week.

The Russian police in recent months have been rocked by a series of scandals,
including a shooting rampage by a Moscow policeman that killed two earlier this
year.

Interior Minister Rashid Nurgaliev said Thursday that Russians had the right to
hit back if attacked by police, Russian news agencies reported.
