Gunmen on Wednesday shot and killed a former policeman who was convicted last year of killing a journalist critical of officials in Russia's violent Caucasus region.

A spokesman for the police in the republic of Ingushetia, Ali Musayev, said Ibragim Yevloyev was killed by two men who opened fire on him with assault rifles in a cafe in Nazran, the republic's principal city.

Last December, Yevloyev was convicted and given a two-year suspended sentence for the killing of Magomed Yevloyev, who ran a website that reported on abuses, abductions and killings in Ingushetia. The two Yevloyevs were not related.

Ibragim Yevloyev was the former head of the guard service for Ingushetia's police chief. Magomed Yevloyev was shot in the head in a police car after being detained as he stepped off a flight from Moscow in August 2008.

Police said he was shot during a scuffle and Ibragim Yevloyev was convicted of involuntary homicide. Magomed Yevloyev's relatives protested the sentence as too light and claimed the killing was premeditated.

Musayev, the police spokesman, said investigators were looking into the possibility that Ibragim Yevloyev's death was a revenge killing.

Ingushetia is one of the republics in Russia's Caucasus region that is gripped by violence stemming from separatist fighting in Chechnya and aggravated by widespread complaints of corruption and police abuses.

In the nearby republic of Dagestan, three policemen were killed by attackers.

A spokesman for the regional interior ministry, Vyacheslav Gasanov, said Wednesday that two policemen were killed the previous day in the city of Khasavyurt, on the border with Chechnya, when assailants opened fire on a police squad at a market.

Also Tuesday, an officer of the regional anti-terrorism squad was shot to death in the town of Kizlyar, near Chechnya, Gasanov said.
