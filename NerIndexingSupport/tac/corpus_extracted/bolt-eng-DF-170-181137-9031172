The stadium is ELECTRIC right now, the crowd is pumped up for a BEARS VICTORY over their long time rivals, the Packers.

Sit back and enjoy the ride~
 
 
The football fan in me wants the Pack to win...the Steelers fan in me wants Da Bears to win
 
 
so far rodgers is picking apart the bears pass defense
 
 
Looks like the Pack owns the field so far.
 
 
7 plays 86 yards.
 
 
The Pack does look like the better team so far.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Pack is kicking ass. No denying. Looks like the Bears will go home empty.

14 - 0
 
 
This could get ugly.
 
 
go go go Packers!!!!!

Looong way to go yet - but    
 
 
Fear that I was bringing bad luck. I'm just checking in now and again. Can't watch.

 
 
 
The bears getting packed? 0.0
 
 
The Bears have shown flashes of life, interspersed among flashes of the Bears.

They have nothing for the Pack.

And pro football is still the most boring football on the face of planet Earth.
 
 
So we trade interceptions and looks like the 1st half will end at 14 - 0
 
 
Spent the first half in a bar. Maybe 30 people there mostly Bears fans. Pffft.
Got me a 6 pack to go. I don't like being seen crying in public.
 
 
And still 14- 0, Where oh where did the Pack O go?

Are da Bears just showing up? Or have the Packers just clocked out?
 
 
If you are GB fan...you should be nervous about right now
 
 
I am a nervous wreck right now.........................

Come on Bears, you can do it!
 
 
JUST REMEMBER:

Whichever team wins this game WILL WIN THE SUPERBOWL.

If the Packers do win today I'll be rooting for them in 2 weeks.
 
 
Does he ever get out of the pocket?

That reminds me- time to get my snack on.

Nah, more like swallowed up by it. Good call.
 
 
I am beginning to have doubts about the Pack.......

We're steak, not cheese. Pleeze!  
 
 
And that should end it
 
 
thank god that ugliness is over..the pack can win pretty and ugly...we just saw ugly.
 
 
Yay Shields!
 
 
Well, it wasn't real pretty. But at least it was a game.
 
 
They won. I be happy.
 
 
Looks like bedtime. Wah!

Hardly Echo.
GB played terribly, They are lucky the Bears played worse.
If Green Bay plays like this in the superbowl...they will lose.
 
 
Here's an idea...

Let's run a fucking reverse play on 3rd & 3 with 50 some seconds left in our season, while we're driving hard down the field and only down a TD with the passing game finally working.

That settles it. This means the Steelers are a shoo-in to win the S-Bowl.

amen to that.   in case Echo hasnt been paying attention,each time Green Bay has faced a GOOD defense in the playoffs-the eagles and the bears,rogers and the offense stunk up the joint.If they are not on their game like they were in atlanta,they will be lucky if this game is close.
