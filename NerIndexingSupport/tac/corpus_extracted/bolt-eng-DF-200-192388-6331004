No need to keep using personal pronouns. It sounds absurd.
 
 
J0j0. De dónde eres tío? y a qué ciudad vas?

Bueno, suerte con la solicitud de la Uni!

Well, I apologise if you disapprove of my correct use of the language. I use personal pronouns consistently in English so I will not be altering that for another language. I do not know whether you speak Spanish or not, however in Barcelona, we are taught to be grammatically correct, and by excluding personal pronouns I am going to fail in Spanish, therefore I am not going to alter the way I speak on TSR when it will land me in trouble with my professor!

Yo voy a Tenerife, una isla… pero mi madre es de Barcelona   )

Hi!! I do like the UK ^__^ I've been working there!! But It took me like one week to remember that you drive the "wrong"   way round... and that the majority of you have dinner at 6 pm (ish)... (I have mine at 11 pm (thats soon too hehe)...

See, this is why I prefer Spain   I eat dinner at like 10pm which is too late for here, kinda early in Spain but closer to Spain than home! Except when I visit my grandparents in Torrevieja they still eat dinner at like 6.30pm, which is fine if you eat in, but if you go out for dinner it's like a ghost town   They're adjusting though, heh. They sit out drinking with their neighbours till about 3am...  
 
 
I love the Med style of living.   It's so relaxed and people stay out all night partying,in cafes and if by the sea, they're usually found strolling down the promenade until around 3am. Although once you're back here you need to adjust your routine heavily!

That makes no sense. They are different languages, different rules.

But it is actually wrong. I have a large, degree-level grammar book that states that using the pronouns all the time is wrong. They're quite adamant. But if it's what your teacher wants you to do, do it for the sake of a few marks.
 
 
Hahaha!! I don't know If that's the "Meds Style of Living"... But it is at Spain...

I mean... What day is today??... Friday??? Oh... cool... I'll explain what'll happen today...

Dinner with friends at 11:00 pm (more or less)... at 1:00am we'll go to some pub to have some drinks... and at 2:00 - 2:30am we'll go to some kind of "Disco"  

Be back at home at 8:00 (more or less...)

I remember at the UK... I was feeling sooooooo weird...

With some friends... They wanted to start the "Drinking Thing"... at... 8:00 pm!!!! OMG!!! There's still daylight, I can't do that when the Sun is still shining!!!! (When we do it at 1:00 am)... What I found really funny was that in some pubs... You could see a blackboard painted that said... "TODAY WE CLOSE AT 12:00 (or 00:00... just the same)"...

But well... It depends on each countries culture I supose... Hehehe... But probably this is why it's so great to Party at Spain  
 
 
When I first moved to France us Brits proposed heading to the pub at 7:30pm, and all the other European students laughed at us! A typical evening in France was to eat about 9, pre going out drinks at 10, then either to a house party or disco towards midnight, then at four pile onto the karaoke bar for some singing  
 
 
Welcome  . How's the weather out there?
 
 
Carl... Yeah... thats more or less what happens to me... But we still do those things later... Hehehe ^^

What will Brits do if I say... "Lets go to a Pub at midnight" Hahaha

Hi Holly ^___^ Weather here is great!! Sunny... Hot... Hahaha... Spanish weather... How is it over there? :P:
 
 
A little bit wet... but kinda warm and wet at the same time.

Eugh.
 
 
Well... More or less like Barcelona... I'm quite used to Warm-Wet Weather... Its common at cities near the sea... hehehe... A lot of Humidity...
