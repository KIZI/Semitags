I've been wrong all season thus far.  Why break a trend?

Eagles  9  -  Fish  6

I don't know the O/U figure, but I'd bet the Under.

Best,
Lou

My prediction? Ricky Williams gets high before halftime.

Eagles 21
Dolphins 6 (but the RB will think it's "groovey")

Now that the Fins have announced that Beck will start, the chances of
a fairly close Iggs win (which would have been my pick) decrease, and
the chances of either a Fins upset (if Beck shines, and the Iggs are
taken by surprise, having no tape on him) OR an Iggs blowout (if Beck
blows or is rattled) increase.  As this is still the only (relatively)
sure win remaining in the season, I say the latter:

Iggs 31
Fins 13

Sorry, but the Eagles won last week, they will take Miami lightly (SIC)
yes I know they haven't won a game yet, which is exactly why the Eagles
will dissapoint us again and pretty much end their hopes for the season.
If it happens some heads should roll.

Miami 17
Eagles 14

Is there anyone on the Dolphins' roster that the Eagles can ensure a spot in
the Hall of Fame for?

I have no clue about this game, since I don't think I've seen the same
Eagles team twice in a row...

I'll watch, sure, but I have no clue how it's going to go.
