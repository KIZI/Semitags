 
 
The Boise State Broncos!!!
 
 
Are going to run into a brick wall tomorrow night.

They are favored & ranked higher, but they are playing a team with bigger, better, stronger & faster players.

This "neutral site" game against the Georgia Bulldogs is in the Georgia Dome.

Dawgs win & end the "Boise should be considered for the Mythical National Championship game despite their creampuff strength of schedule because...(insert ridiculous bullshit reason here)"

Last night's games were weak. Tomorrow starts the real deal!

 
 
 
Boise State delivered a butt kicking to Georgia (35-21) just like they do to every powerhouse they meet in the regular season

But fear not......the BCS will screw them come Bowl Season
 
 
Any school named 'Boise' gets my support.

It would be like some guy having his dad name him 'Sue'.

Mountain states are tough competitors. It is the altitude.

Southern girls are to die for.

My father played for Boise State!

Go Broncos!
 
 
they have a pretty easy schedule from here...

In terms of national ranking at the end of the season, Boise State has been the best team over thee last five seasons and has nothing to show for it.

They will run the table once again, and the BCS will find some excuse to stick them in an inconsequential bowl game.

If ever there was a reason for Div 1 playoffs, Boise State is it
 
 
I'm all for a playoff.

Boise needs to BEG the Big 12 to let them in

If the big 12 could get Boise, Houston & Air Force, they would be a pretty respectable conference
