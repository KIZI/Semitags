Last month, Rutgers officials said they had booked Morrison  author of "Beloved," "Song of Solomon" and other novels  to speak in a 52,000-seat football stadium at commencement in May. She will be paid $30,000, marking the first time Rutgers has written a check for a graduation speaker.

Snooki's appearance at Rutgers met with mixed reactions from students Snooki's appearance at Rutgers met with mixed reactions from students Over 1,000 Rutgers students lined the Livingston Student Center to see MTV's Snooki in a question and answer session. The Jersey Shore reality star 'sold out' two separate sessions but admission was free on a first come, first serve basis. Students waited in line as early as 1pm for an 8pm start. The Rutgers University Programming Association paid $32,000 for Snooki's appearance.

Tonight, Rutgers students said they had also made a big-name booking. Snooki  the "Jersey Shore" star whose real name is Nicole Polizzi  appeared at two question-and-answer sessions at the Livingston Student Center in Piscataway.

Her fee: $32,000

Unlike Morrison, who was booked by university officials, a student-run committee invited Snooki. The Rutgers University Programming Association paid the reality star using the mandatory student activity fees undergraduates must pay with their tuition.

When asked what her advice was for Rutgers students, she said: "Study hard, but party harder."

Speechless...

Who the fuck is Toni Morrison?
 
 
 
Morrison is a  Nobel Prize  and  Pulitzer Prize  -winning American novelist, editor, and professor. Her novels are known for their  epic  themes, vivid dialogue, and richly detailed  black  characters. Among her best known novels are  The Bluest Eye ,  Song of Solomon  and  Beloved .\

 

The shocking thing is that a poet gets paid anything at all, really.

Who the fuck is Toni Morrison?

 

Probably our next President.

Seems to have similar qualifications to Obama.

Nobel Prize, wrote a stupid book, and focuses on black subject matter.

Yeah, but she was born in America so  
 
 
I don't get the outrage.
 
 
This just goes to show the epic failure of parenting skills.

We have children that have never been punished raising children that were never punished.

And some of us are shocked that a Nobel winner gets less money and attention at a College, than a drunken TV whore.

Don't be, we are still going down hill.
 
 
 
Who the fuck is Toni Morrison?

 

Toni Morrison is the woman who said that Bill Clinton was the first Black President.
 A STROLL DOWN MEMORY LANE Clinton as the first black president 

 
White skin notwithstanding, this is our first black President. Blacker than any actual black person who could ever be elected in our children's lifetime. After all, Clinton displays almost every trope of blackness: single-parent household, born poor, working-class, saxophone-playing, McDonald's-and-junk-food-loving boy from Arkansas.

So Snooki is better at negotiating a contract...why is this such a big deal. Doesn't Palin get even more and she's just an attention whore.

Not so much to do with the money to me.

A Nobel winning author drew an average crowd of students.

A dumb cunt draws so many that she got a 2nd day.

What this tells me is that the up and coming generation thinks little of earning greatness compared to whoreing for money and fame

  What a fuddy duddy you are. The students decide who they want to hire to entertain them. Who cares if they hire a tv personality or Billy Graham. It's their business and no one else's, certainly not yours.

What's it like in Never Never land? Where things happen with majic and nothing means anything?
 
 
Snooki cracks me up, what little I've seen of her. I'd pay more to see her than to see Toni Morrison. With some exceptions I don't get poetry and I don't even remember if I've ever even tried to read one of her poems though I must have done.
 
 
You know what? I'd probably even pay more to hear Allie Baba babble than to hear most poets. So shoot me, I have no class.

WYGD?
 
 
Sorry, but this is a sad state of the youth of America.

Where they will pay more money for a reality show tramp than a respected writer.

These are the same people that want Donald Trump and Sarah Palin for President too.

I fear for our future with people like this.

She also writes novels and is a very good story teller.

But probably not really what students want their activity fees paying for...anyway, she's merely speaking at the commencement ceremony.

I can't believe the outrage over this...Snooki must be some horrible evil murderer or something on the level of Dick Cheney.

Sigh...not you too, EZ. The various clubs are given money to spend as they wish as long as they are not engaging in illegal activity. At my daughter's college some of the money is used to hire *gasp* rock and roll bands that the students have been seen moshing over!!!!

Ravi, they are paying money for SNOOKIE!

Not Munford and Sons or Arcade Fire, but some skank from a reality tv show.

Big Difference in my opinion. She doesn't make music, she does nothing. What wisdom and value does she bring to these college kids?

All that education down the drain.

Sheesh! I need to look at a Snooki video now.

This is an exaggeration ala being an old man.

Who would have been a bigger draw at college in say, the 70's. Clint Eastwood, The Rolling Stones, The Beatles.......... or....A Nobel speaker?

You guessed it.

It's no different than that. Snooki is a Celebrity, and it's her Celebrity (fame) drawing the crowd, not her personal intelligence. Get over it.

I don't recall any of those getting invites to speak at a school.

Granted, I was very young at the time.
 
 
Chanel does not think Snookie is a socialist. In fact I believe she voted for McCain because she opposed Obama's "racist tanning tax" or some shit. I understand that the students can hire whoever the hell they want. I am not "outraged" Just saddened and disappointed that my alma mater has sunk so low. I am also a bit angry that the taxpayers of NJ have to indirectly subsidize this crap. The alumni assn won't be seeing another dime from the chanels in the future.

For the record; Snooki is from NY.

The money comes out of the student's activity fees, not from taxpayers.

What kind of entertainment did they have on campus when you attended?
 
 
Mandatory student activity fees are part of the tuition. Tuition is subsidized by the taxpayers. Let's not split hairs.

I was a semi-active member of Ramblin Rose productions. We hosted Bob Weir my last year. That is talent. Oh and we SOLD tickets to pay for the show.

One of the comments on the artice said it all. "It's official. College is now high school" Truer words...

I see, you feel that since it is a state university the state should choose who the students have for entertainment. I guess comedy is a no-no. How sad.
 
 
Poor maligned Snooki!!!!! I love her even more now!!!!

Don't tell chanel, but in 2007 they had *gasp* Ghostface Killah!
 
 
I have no idea who that is, but my gut tells me the tickets were not free and Killah may have talent.

And Ang - Snookie has had her 15 mins. It's been three years! Ugh!
 
 
 
George Zoffinger, who is at the end of his term as a member of the Rutgers Board of Governors, said the national publicity about Snooki’s appearance damaged the state university’s image.

"You build a university to have a reputation to help kids get good jobs. Today, it’s a laughingstock — it’s Snooki U. We should be outraged," Zoffinger said.

How sad. Rutgers destroyed by Snooki. How many students have ruined their lives by being on the committee that hired light-hearted entertainment for their school?

I personally would not send my kids to a college that doesn't let students have a tiny bit of control over what entertainment they hire and instead relies on the state to decide.
 
 
Ha ha ravi. You may want to rethink that statement. When selecting a college, I highly doubt looking into the bylaws of student activity groups, might be at the top of the lisr. Just some friendly advice from someone who has een through the tortuous process twice.

My son was accepted to Rutgers. He will not be attending simply because they don't give a shit about whether students pass or fail. That's something that was important to us. Entertainment was not a factor.

Can't have some pretty conservative woman setting a good example of a reasonable political alternative for women. Count Michelle Bachman in that class as well. The witch was another.

Well that's the thing now isn't it. They're not reasonable, they're flat out stupid, and it's people like my 12-year old Nephew whom it's even obvious to........ that the "left," (which really it's not the left, most a-political people have the sense that she's a moron)isn't "askured" of her, they're oblivious to how people cannot see how fucking dumb the woman is.

That sounds like a joke I would make.
 
 
 
 
Last month, Rutgers officials said they had booked Morrison  author of "Beloved," "Song of Solomon" and other novels  to speak in a 52,000-seat football stadium at commencement in May. She will be paid $30,000, marking the first time Rutgers has written a check for a graduation speaker.

The Jersey Shore reality star 'sold out' two separate sessions but admission was free on a first come, first serve basis. Students waited in line as early as 1pm for an 8pm start. The Rutgers University Programming Association paid $32,000 for Snooki's appearance.

Tonight, Rutgers students said they had also made a big-name booking. Snooki  the "Jersey Shore" star whose real name is Nicole Polizzi  appeared at two question-and-answer sessions at the Livingston Student Center in Piscataway.

Her fee: $32,000

Unlike Morrison, who was booked by university officials, a student-run committee invited Snooki. The Rutgers University Programming Association paid the reality star using the mandatory student activity fees undergraduates must pay with their tuition.

When asked what her advice was for Rutgers students, she said: "Study hard, but party harder."

Unlike Morrison, who was booked by university officials, a student-run committee invited Snooki. The Rutgers University Programming Association paid the reality star using the mandatory student activity fees undergraduates must pay with their tuition.

When asked what her advice was for Rutgers students, she said: "Study hard, but party harder."

Speechless...  

 

What a joke. The world has gone mad.
 
 
Update:

 
New Jersey's public universities students would have to "opt in" to paying for student events  like last week's appearance by "Jersey Shore" star Snooki at Rutgers University  under new legislation Sen. Joe Kyrillos is preparing to propose in the state Senate.

Kyrillos (R-Monmouth/Middlesex) said students at state colleges and universities should have a clearer choice of whether they want to pay for student-planned events that carry fees.

Kyrillos described Snooki as "a degenerate reality television star who offers neither useful advice nor any appreciable talents."

While I concur with Sen. Kyrillo's statement, I do believe this legislation is a wee bit opportunistic.

Snooooooki !! !

Fucking Idiots.      
 
 
 
 
Who the fuck is Toni Morrison?

 

Probably our next President.

Seems to have similar qualifications to Obama.

Nobel Prize, wrote a stupid book, and focuses on black subject matter.

 

"The Bluest Eye" was a great book.

To each his own I guess.

Since Toni Morrison is black, expect cries of "racism" from the usual suspects in 3.... 2.... 1.....

 

You're the first one in the thread to mention racism, ace.

Grats.
 
 
 
 
 
So Snooki is better at negotiating a contract...why is this such a big deal. Doesn't Palin get even more and she's just an attention whore.

 

To the right she's a voice for sanity and a major threat to the Democrat base.

 

Snooki is a voice for sanity for the Right.

That sounds like a joke I would make.

 

Well if you've ever seen Jersey Shore..she the sanest kid in the group.

And that's really not saying much. To be fair..my analysis is based on one show. No way I could sit through another. Well not sober at least.  
 
 
Sanest? I think she's been arrested twice. I watch the show. She has a cute personality - for a 12 year old. The problem is that she's not 12. She has an alcohol problem and sadly I predict she is going to be a statistic once her 15 minutes are over. Instead of coaching the kids at Rutgers on the art of GTL, maybe she should sign up for a few classes.
