Dont put your short sleeve jerseys away just yet! Temps looks to be in
the mid 80s. Hot Hot Hot just like that calypso tune you hear around
Brooklyn. I also have special permission to tour Kingsborough
Community College, where we'll take in beautiful rare views of the
ocean front.

And it'll be nice and easy since we're all going to Sandy Hook on
Sunday, right?

Hi Josh,

Great to hear about the nice weekend weather. Maybe some of us will hum "Theme from A Summer Place."

Unfortunately, going to Sandy Hook is not part of the Twin Lights bike event, this year. If I finish the century at a good hour, I might take a 12-mile side trip there.

By the way, how does one get permission to visit Kingsborough Community College? I've ridden parts of that neighborhood and each time I tried to go to KCC, security staff would not let me in. It would make a good future day trip.

It helps to work at CUNY. But whenever you are ready I'll give you the
contact.

Josh,

I'm sorry I missed this ride.  I've lived in NYC for over 23 years, &
i don't know enough about Jewish customs, which I hate to admit - it's
embarassing.  I want to learn though, so I hope you'll offer this rode
again in the future.

In the meantime, I'll enjoy the photos.

Charis.
