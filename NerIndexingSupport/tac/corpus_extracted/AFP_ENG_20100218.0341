NATO will remain in control of the homegrown Kosovo Security Force (KSF) for up
to four years until it reaches full operational capacity, a senior NATO official
said Thursday.

"When NATO took on responsibilities on training the Kosovo Security Force we
said that we will have executive authority till full operational capability," US
Admiral Mark Fitzgerald, the commander of NATO's southeast wing, said.

"We estimate that it will take somewhere in the order of two to four years," he
told reporters.

The force, which will have civil protection functions and number around 2,500,
was launched in January 2009 -- almost a year after Kosovo unilaterally declared
independence from Serbia.

The NATO-trained force took over from the Kosovo Protection Corps (KPC),  made
up mainly of former members of the Kosovo Liberation Army, the separatist
guerrilla force that fought Serbia during the 1998-1999 Kosovo war.

While the force is not intended to be a fully-fledged army straight away, its
creation has angered Serbia which still considers Kosovo its southern province.

NATO has been tasked with providing security in Kosovo since it ousted Serbian
troops during a 78-day bombing campaign to stop a Serbian crackdown on
separatist ethnic Albanian rebels.

In January the alliance downsized the number of Kosovo peacekeepers (KFOR) by
3,000, promising the slimmed down force of 10,000 would still provide the same
level of security.

Fitzgerald said the KFOR was planning to slowly hand over to local police the
security of the nine most significant Serb religious and cultural sites --mostly
monasteries-- in Kosovo, which have been guarded by international peacekeepers
since the war.

"We will continue in the future to look at how we might unfix KFOR from these
sites," he said

"As we look at the future we look to the capabilities of the Kosovo police to
take over some of that responsibility," he explained.
