Super October

2 Important Things:

1. Nora & I have a few days off and she needs to take a day off in October.
The price of tickets are REALLY cheap ($155 after tax on Frontier: Direct
Flight).  Is there anything going on in October that you guys are doing?
Help me pick a weekend!!!  I miss you all!!!

2. The prices of tickets between Denver and Milwaukee are REALLY cheap.  If
anyone would like to come to Miwaukee and have a super fun weekend, let me
know.  The pool is up and running, there are lots of fun things to do, you
get a free place to stay, come see the new house, etc, etc.  Let me know if
you're interested.

Hope everyone is doing well.

P.S.: Is there a Facebook application to say "Happy Birthday"?  I got a few
messages yesterday from people I haven't talked to since high school... and
I didn't talk to them much in high school.
P.P.S.  @Jon, How did you HS reunion go?  What did you tell everyone you're
doing these days?

The reunion was a good time.  I got drunk.  I wussed out and only told one person that I was a freelance flag football quarterback.  Everyone else got the true story and gave me the token "ooh that sounds interesting" response.

Ben and I have the PE exam on the weekend of Oct. 24th, so don't come that weekend.  Any other weekend should be OK.
