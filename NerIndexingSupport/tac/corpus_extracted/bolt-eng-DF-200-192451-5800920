 Article .

 
President Hugo Chavez delivered a bizarre attack on the Queen when the firebrand Venezuelan leader demanded Britain return the Falkland Islands to Argentina.

The outspoken Mr Chavez used his weekly television and radio show Alo Presidente to rally Latin America behind the cause of his Argentine counterpart Cristina Kirchner by making a direct appeal to Buckingham Palace.

"Look, England, how long are you going to be in Las Malvinas? Queen of England, I'm talking to you," said Mr Chavez.

"The time for empires are over, haven't you noticed? Return the Malvinas to the Argentine people."

Still addressing the Queen, he went on: "The English are still threatening Argentina. Things have changed. We are no longer in 1982. If conflict breaks out, be sure Argentina will not be alone like it was back then."

He described British control of the islands in the South Atlantic as "anti-historic and irrational" and asked "why the English speak of democracy but still have a Queen".

Mrs Kirchner later sought to win new allies in its claims to the islands when she made a direct appeal for support at a meeting in Mexico of the Rio Group of Latin American and Caribbean countries.

All hail comrade Chavez!

On a serious note, he's lost the plot. How can the president of a country not comprehend the fact that Britain is made up of 4 countries and not 1?
 
 
Haha I'd love it if Argentina declared war on the UK with Venezuala. Well actually the results could be pretty dire, but it would be amusing in a way. They'd get destroyed.
 
 
I can not believe that a leader of a country could be so uneducated, does he not realize that the queen is only a figurehead and actually holds no power, he thinks that we still obey her.
 
 
I can't believe Chavez is attempting to give us a lecture on democracy.  
 
 
We Have A £100bil Nuclear Warhead System For A Reason.
 
 
Awww, it's cute the way some countries think they have power   Oh no Argentina and Venezuela? We're quaking in our boots!

He has won more elections in the past ten years than most other 'democratic' states' leaders.
 
 
Should have used that nuke they apparently had with them in 1982

Through completely  moral and democratic  means, I am sure.  
 
 
What a dick. I truly hate this man with a passion. He is anti-democratic (changed the law so that all TV channels have to carry his address), bigoted (attack on the former Spanish PM) and just generally a bully. He has no right to interfere with our affairs. It's also convenient when he's talking about democracy to remain blind to the fact that the islanders want to remain British.

EDIT: Nice, British Tweed jacket. Shame about the prick wearing it.
 
 
He's the Latin American version of Bush to me. An absolute idiot and couldn't run a tea shop on a Sunday, but he is extremely amusing to watch when he babbles on about democracy.
 
 
Fool.
 
 
I dont see why they think they have a claim seeing as those island are british and do not want to be a apart of that crumbling country its not an empire it would be like france saying wales belonged to them
 
 
I used to think when he started off he did some good things in helping the poorest, but hes gone mad and just wants power. Everyone ruins socialism, its sad.

  You give HRW's complete submission to US propaganda where Vivacano outlines his own political motivations within it.Here is a few exerts of the letter in which over 100 Latin American experts sent to HRW regarding the report,most of which not from Venezuela:

The document, A Decade Under Chávez: Political Intolerance and Lost Opportunities for Advancing Human Rights in Venezuela, appears to be a politically motivated essay rather than a human rights report. Indeed, the lead author of the report, Jose Miguel Vivanco, stated as much when he told the press just a few days after its publication, "We did the report because we wanted to demonstrate to the world that Venezuela is not a model for anyone…"

The report's overwhelming reliance for factual material on opposition sources of dubious reliability also undermines its credibility and makes it difficult for most readers to know which parts of the report are true and which aren't. The most cited source with regard to political discrimination is the newspaper El Universal.[5] This is not only a stridently opposition newspaper, it has also, for the years during which it is cited, repeatedly fabricated news stories. For example, in a typical fabrication of the type deployed to libel government officials, El Universal reported that then Interior Minister Jesse Chacón had purchased a painting for $140,000.[6] This turned out to be completely false. There are many examples of fabrications in El Universal, as well as other opposition sources cited by the report.

We find it troubling that a report on Human Rights depends heavily on unreliable sources. Would a report on human rights in the United States be taken seriously if it relied so heavily on Fox News, or even worse The National Enquirer? Indeed, this report ventures even further into the zone of unreliable sources and cites a mentally unstable opposition blogger as a source. (p. 20, footnote 30). This is a person who indulges not only in routine fabrications and advocates the violent overthrow of the government, but also has publicly fantasized about killing his political enemies and dumping the bodies from helicopters into the slums, and torturing others by "pour[ing] melted silver into their eyes."

The report even uses innuendo to imply that the government is to blame for attacks on journalists, which have occurred against both opposition and pro-government journalists. The authors state that the opposition TV station Globovisión "has received warning letters from CONATEL because of the political tone of its reporting, it has been frequently refused entry to government press conferences, and its reporters and cameramen have been physically attacked and threatened by Chávez supporters." (p. 117) The authors provide no evidence that the government in any way condoned or supported such alleged attacks.

Those are just a few exerts of the letter(which can be viewed at  https://nacla.org/node/5334  ) which has been signed from Harvard professors to Middlesex professors.Next time use credible reports,not such flawed ones when making arguments.
 
 
they will attack with shoes and stones. Be wary.

Being an apologist for Hugo Chavez is a rather silly stance to take, especially when the question is regarding democracy.

Picture which I took when in the Falklands in January:

 
 
 
I fail to see how an island 1000's of miles away from the UK can be claimed by the UK.
Chavez is right in what he's saying.

Because we found it and populated it perhaps? And the people of the Falklands want to remain British just as it has been throughout its history?

Argentina's claim is just stupid. It's like saying France should own the UK, because we are near them. Or that Korea should own Japan or that Indonesia should own Australia. Just because it is an island and it is somewhat nearby doesn't mean you have a magical right to ownership of it. Especially when the islands have been under British rule for longer than Argentina itself has existed.

France have as much a right to claim the UK as Argentina do to the Falklands. Would you also be up for that?
 
 
You know.. I'm American and all but..
GO UK GO !!! Kick their asses. Let see some SAS action.  
 
 
In all serious, are troops are so stretched at the moment, I don't think we would have the ability to wage all out war on them.

Unless we pulled out of Afghanistan, but even then...

On the other hand, someone tells this idiot that she is not "Queen of England", she is Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland!  
 
 
Propaganda.  
 
 
What a schmuck.
 
 
Aww the little cutie thinks he can threaten us.
How cute.

But in all seriousness what claim does Argentina have? If this man supports democracy he will support the Falklands right to stay with the United Kingdom as they want.
 
 
Hugo Chavez is a pompous little man who has grown to big for his boots. He's frequently criticized western leaders, but it would be good just to show him where he should stand. He seems to be to be something like a South American Gaddaffi, a man with extremist views who talks out of his hat/beret.

I can't imagine Argentina declaring war. They are very weak (we would easily beat them even while still fighting in Afghanistan). I also don't imagine many other countries in South America actually helping an invasion (seems more like rhetoric to me, not that I'm an expert on the matter), but in that case, we would be assisted by many other countries. As long as we are the "legal owners" of the Falkland Islands, and the islanders what to remain British and not Argentine, the UN will be on our side.

From what I gather, Argentina is making this a big problem to distract from the domestic problems they have (like the last time - but at least this time its a reasonably sensible democracy, not a dictatorship). The Argentine people don't seem to really be that bothered about the islands.
 
 
Chavez is treading deep water. If he declared war on the UK it could be the excuse the US has been waiting a long time for. Toppling crazy latino's hasn't been relegated to the dusty books of history yet.

I hope they do declare war and this time we attack their cities and bring Argentina and her allies to their knees till they officially renounce any claims to the Falkands. We left the job half done last time. War has to have very real consequences or it will keep happening - this is why America is a war-state for example; it has not been made to suffer on a level comparable to many others. We eradicated the scourge of war in Europe by burying generations of Europeans in the Flanders. Time to bury a generation of Argentinians imo.

What I do find bizarre is that people are claiming proximity to a territory is grounds for claiming it. That sounds awfully like imperialism to me. Self-determination should rule - those that wish to be part of the UK and that the UK wishes to be part of the UK - should be parts of the UK. I don't see Argentine flags being hoisted all over the Falklands by the locals, not surprising as they're English speaking Brits who have never been ruled by Argentina.

whilst i believe chavez needs a punch in the face, the falklands issue can be settled easily. have a referendum of everyone on the islands with a straight choice: the UK or argentina? then if they choose to stay with us and the argies don't like it, bomb Bueonos Aries

What about the settlers before Britain claimed the islands in 1833?

If I remember correctly the first settlers were French. Should we have ousted them?

The Governments of Argentina, the Falklands and the UK are all well aware the people living on the Falklands want nothing to do with Argentina already.

So you would also support a Spanish invasion of Gibraltar, a French invasion of the Channel Islands and an Irish invasion of Northern Ireland?
 
 
Quite ironic he speaks of diplomacy and democracy whilst shutting down TV channels that don't support his mad, "irrational" policies.
 
 
Let me clarify my position:

I respect that the islanders are British because they are most likely direct descendants of the original claimants. I respect that they want nothing to do with Argentina. However if it is invaded I don't want anything on the scale of 1982. It will amount to mass murder and a gross waste of taxpayers' money. I am certain that an agreement can be reached though; we live in the diplomatic age.

We didn't oust the French, we colonised a different Island unaware they were there, and then the Spanish took over it and attacked the British settlement.

This stuff it pretty easy to look up - if you're going to start arguing about it you could at least do a bit of research.

Your point? Just because no-ones there doesn't mean it isn't ours anymore. I'm sure there are some islands up in Scotland no-one lives on, doesn't make it ok for them to be invaded and settled by Norway etc.

Why restrict this to islands? Using your logic of "if you don't have people living there its not yours" we could legitamately take large areas of land off France - it would solve our over crowding problem...

Because it's illogical taking exclaves compared to islands. They are separate areas of land and are very clearly defined.

So its land clearly defined as belonging to the UK, yet is fair game for any country to take whenever they want?

This is all irrelevent anyway. The Falklands have been British for ages, the Islanders are British, the Islanders want to be British and the UN recognises them as British.

As the British government quite rightly replied to an Argentinian request for discussions over the Falklands, "there is nothing to discuss, the islands are British and will remain British".

The Brits retook the islands from the Argentine inhabitants who most definitely didn't want to be British in 1833, but that's moot I suppose.

I said I agree that the islands are British. I just want to make the point that it isn't a war worth fighting; we can't finance it for a start.

It's simple, we do what we did with Gibraltar, let them vote on it. There is no way the UN would ever support Argentina's claim if the Islanders themselves didn't want to be governed by Argentina. Lets be honest, the only reason they have restarted this arguement is because of Oil.

Oil which the UK and Western Europe desperately want and need. Lets go to a worst case scenario (Highly improbably, and I mean Highly Improbable as in it's as likely as me sprouting wings whilst typing this message and flying to the Falklands myself to fight off the Argentinian horde, oh sorry got off track there)

Argentina declares war with the rest of South America, which is making moves to have a massive American alliance which excludes the US and Canada, on Britain (Read it in a BBC report this morning) EU, and possibley the US would intervene. Sure last time they didnt, this time round the EU is much more united, (Passing of the Lisbon treaty) and the US actually can have an interest (Because theres oil now obviously) So although Argentinia wouldn't be alone, neither would be teh British. Especially as the EU is desperate to get off the Natural Gas it lives off from Russia, and it's dependency from the Middle Eastern states.

So for those who can't be bothered to read the rest of what I wrote (I know I wouldnt be arsed to read it) Basically, if worst case scenario does happen, Britain wouldn't be on it's own.

i'd rather see tax payers money / money being borrowed to defend our own soil than see it wasted on some immigrants.
 
 
oh no, watch out, its a rag tag bunch of south americans.
excuse me while i **** myself.

tbh we should just go in and PWN the whole continent.

We can't finance anything at the moment because funds are being squandered as we speak in Afghanistan. Going back to the Falklands would most likely pull the government back down when it seems to be emerging from debt.
 
 
I like how most of UK public are so quickly to defend the Falkland Islands. The irony hits back, when the British Government invaded Iraq and Afghanistan over oil (iraq) and poppy fields (afghanistan).

Of course we can finance it. All we did in 1982 was send a task force to re-take the islands. Money can always be found for war  

Besides, Argentina would never declare an all out war, they certainly couldn't finance it or have any credible support for it to be possible.
 
 
  yes this is what argentina needed all along, the backing from venezuela, finally they are powerful enough to take us on

You seem to forget about the oil part in the Falklands, to get our hands on Oil in our own terrirotyr (Apparently they expect 60 billion barrels worth) is almost priceless, especially, as I noted before, Europe wanting to move to a more stable source of energy provider.(considering the ideal power provider, fusion energy, isn't goign to be around for another 50 years it;s a safe bet that oil will be wanted)

Considering that we need Oil for almost anything nowerdays, I think we could find the finance to get to the Falklands and win a war over it (Which isn't going to happen anyway Argentina already ruled out a War) You must also remember that the financial stability and health of Britain wasn't much better in the last war either.

The Argentine who founded the settlement on the Falklands broke the conditions laid down by the British who had given the initial permission for him to do so. He then ordered American fishing vessels to be seized and arrested their crew, resulting in America attacking the settlement. The UK then took back what was originally theirs and let the settlers already there stay. So I agree its a moot point as they shouldn't have been there in the first place (and it took place almost 180 years ago!).

Aside from our obligation to protect British citizens, I'm sure the oil around the Falklands would cover the cost of such a military operation (not that I think there will be one).
 
 
And if they call our bluff?
 
 
Chavez is a lolcow.

I'll assume you're talking about if they declare war. As I've already outlined, even if they had the whole of South America on side. Europe would easily support Britain, with the possiblity of US support aswell.

Hardly ironic. The UK public didn't want a war in Iraq and regardless, both wars were/are supported by the respective populations as they were being repressed. A stupid comparison in my opinion.

Does anyone know if we actually benefited from the oil in Iraq anyway? If anything, I'd say we lost out due to the large increases in oil prices due to the war.
 
 
To anyone who agrees with Chavaz, I say this.

The people of the Falklands want to remain "British". They want Britain to hold sovereignty over the Island. In fact, they seem more "British" than many people I know. (They even have the red telephone boxes its so cool)

They do not want to be a part of Argentina nor want them to hold any sovereignty over them. Argentina has no claim. Britain has the support of the people and the people want Britain.

If you continue to support Argentina's claim then you clearly do not support the right of self determination thus would surely support British Imperialism?

Oh no that is totally different you say? Why is it?

We denied them; for many years, their right to self determination and that is what you propose.

Corrupt semi-feudal oligarchy that can barely control its own streets?

A single British nuclear sub could block the entirety of South America from access to the Falklands. They're pretty much the weakest continent on earth.

Thats why I said, possibility. However, Europe is one of the suspected 'Next Superpowers' along with the likes of China India and Russia.

If I had to play 'Continents wars' I would easily pick Europe over Latin America (Who coincidently get most of their armaments from Europe). And as another poster as already said, I would doubt Brazil would get involved, they are dependent on the western investment. It's only the unstable, weaker, countries like Venezula that would actually do anything.

And ultimately, this isn't going to end up in a war, if you look at Argentina's track record since 1982, they've been pretty good, especially when it comes to the UN who they have actively worked for in peace keeping missions. This is what will happen.

They get their reply from the UN who I give an 80% chance of saying " It's Britains Oil and land" or 15% chance of "Let the islanders hold a vote" and a 5% chance of "yes that oil is yours". In each scenario the Argentines will act accordingly.

You're kidding us aren't you?

Brazil is quite high up on my list of least threatening countries. Especially once you've omitted Africa. Just because it has economic potential does not make it a military power. I honestly think you're massively over-rating the ability of South Americans to fight wars. Didn't you see how Iraq got torn limb by limb by Europeans and Americans? They had one of the most advanced and biggest armies in the third world. Brazil has nothing on Saddam-era Iraq, it would be an even bigger walk over.

You must learn to see beyond population figures and size of countries and realise that these places have very weak states that can be shattered easily. It is difficult to appreciate how weak the state is in some foreign countries when you're used to living in the UK - where state presence throughout its territory is one of the highest in the world.

If you read, and believe, the paper 'Crude designs' then in the long run British firms will most definately benefit form oil contracts in Iraq.

In regards to the Falklands i don't believe there is a major issue. By all accounts the general sentiment in Argentina is that the Malivinas are rightfully theres but there is also the strong belief that runs parallel to this that there is no way they can fight for the Islands and win.

Its a common theme in Argentinas political-economic cycle...times get bad defer attention to international issues. Except this time they lack the finance and equipment even worse then we do, we have come out straight away and affirmed out commitment and we have up to 2000 troops stationed in the Falklands and a growing Naval prescence...That and the political powers of Argentina have already committed to democratic means writing off any military engagement.

How is this relevent, in any way, to the debate at hand? The people living there now are British, and have made it clear that they want to stay that way. Are you just playing devil's advocate, because your point is stupid to the point of being suspicious. The people who live on the islands are British, not Argentinian. This is obviously more important than physical geography.

Is this a theory worth applying when thousands of lives could potentially be at stake?

This is obviously more important than physical geography.

 

I rate this post. The fact that the people living there are British, and consider themselves British, is the only matter of importance. If that isn't a good enough reason to defend those islands then I don't know what is. Just because they're living thousands and thousands of miles away doesn't make them any less British, or any less important than us living in the mainland UK.

atleast us scots the welsh and the northen irish will be ok to own the falklands
 
 
There is a reason why the King of Spain told Chavez to shut up, he's a moron.
 
 
Argentina has, literally, NO claim to them what so ever. Northern Ireland, Israel/Palestine etc have a little bit of reason behind them, but the Falklands; not at all.

France owned them first, then they were British.
Spain and argentina occupied them sporadically for a few years in history, that's it.
The people THERE are British, they've (essentially) always been British, and always will remain so.

Their only claim is the fact they're geographically close.
Well at that rate Canada should have Alaska, Italy should have Corsica and whilst we're at it give Corfu to Albania.

But this could be serious. Spain totally supports Argentina with this, so don't look for support within the EU. America, our so-called ally, would never take on Latin America to defend us. Britain's allies might be a bit sparse if this all blows up again.

Excuse me?

Peoples self-determination is at stake. According to your logic we should all shrug our shoulders if Russia invaded the UK, because it's close to the Russian province of Norway which was made a province because it was close to the Russian province of Finland, which was made a province because it is next to Russia.

You talk absolute ********. States and nations are not defined by geography but by culture and a mutual desire to form a political unit together. The Falklands, inhabited by the descendents of British colonists and have been flying a British flag for centuries and practising a British culture - with to remain in political union with the UK.

Claiming land simply on the basis of it's proximity is imperialism. The Falklands wants to be part of the UK and there is a cultural basis for this.

The European Union is an implicit mutual defence pact. You must remember that Brits will be defenders here, protecting the right of people to remain in political union with the UK against a foreign imperialistic power.*

I would see hundreds of thousands dead if it was necessary - war would not of been a British choice but an action forced on the UK by aggressive imperialists.

*What's their best claim? Spain had a colony on it for a few years a couple of centuries ago?   Last time I checked, Argentina wasn't even Spain and didn't even exist then! How can you claim something that was never even part of your nation and has another culture?!
 
 
The man's a first class warmonger.

I actually like Hugo Chavez, he has a history of winding up the US and now he's doing it with Britain. I love the reactions of this thread, actually sitting LOL'ing.. Chavez is likea real life troll  
 
 
@jakethomas991

There are cases of International Law for which in similar scenarios the geographic factor played a crucial role. However, politics and international law often privilege power over justice, therefore two identical cases can still produce different results. The point here is that if the UK cares about peace and security, it will leave the colonial history behind and give the Falklands to Argentina, which has all the interest in taking care of the island.
 
 
if venezuela think they can build anti-us or anti-uk alliance with the likes of brazil, they are mistaken.

Brazil's president may be left wing, but his government is a broad coalition of cross-spectrum parties that wouldn't allow him to pursue a war with the uk (i doubt he would anyway, we buy a lot of timber, etc from brazil)
Columbia wouldn't join venezuela as chavez supplies the FARC geurilla's

those two countries have the best military and columbia will take any chance they get to punch chavez on the nose (metaphorically, of course).
caricom (the carribbean community) and the rios group are not a threat, many caricom countries are in the commonwealth and wouldn't want to lose trade links from that
peru's president won't join chavez, the same can be said of chile's president elect who is firmly right wing.
uruguay's natural rivalry with argentina rules them out too. Fernando Lugo of paraguay shares the left with chavez, but is a former priest and refused to switch diplomatic recognition from taiwan to china, so it is doubtful he supports chavez.

so take them away and what have you got? mexico (who are susceptable to US pressure), panama, venezeula, argentina, suriname, bolivia, el salvador and guadeloupe and perhaps some carribbean islands. Hardly NATO, is it?
 
 
He needs to calm down...

that last part, is that not what Argentina wants to do to the FALKLANDS?

dont talk to us about arrogance, its our land. Perhaps if Argentina behaved like a civilized country we would treat them as such.

Dispite the fact that Britain had layed claim to the Falklands before Argintina was even a unified country. And i expect Canada, Australia and New Zealand would offer support even if a couple of a subs dont bring Buenos Aires to its knees.

I read somewhere that the oil company drilling down there is an aNglo-Australian company. This might drag Australia in if the situation were to escalate.

Vaporizing them is the only thing thats going to win you the war. Whatever force has been siphoned into Afghanistan has failed miserably against an adversary that is poorly armed and has a very slight numerical advantage. In any case, here's a suggestion: try vaporizing any country, try doing it Burkina Faso and see if British society remains unaffected or not. There's more to this than "we're rich, we'll bomb and kill you and you can't do jack about it".

Please tell me that you don't actually believe that those glorified terrorists have killed 1 million terrorists. I can assure you that figure is:
(a) Wildly inaccurate.
(b) Includes a substantial amount (roughly 65-75%) of civilian casualties, inflicted by blue team.

yes, but largely because people do not know how to properly differentiate between the different terms...

anyway, Chavez has carved himself out quite a niche in stirring the pot against western dominance - personally I find it and him quite entertaining but if I were in his position I would be more concerned by the US-trained columbian special forces rattling their sabres across my border...

the falklands, or the malvinas are a bit of an anachronism. I get the feeling that the govt would happily have handed them back had the population not been against it. As it is, self-determination should probably be respected.

No, I don't think 1million have been killed, I was just using that figure as an example. However, please show me proof of the actual figures and the civilian casualty rate. Genuinley interested and as you seem to have this issue all figured out I'll let you point me to the sources as I'm busy watching House.

Does the opinion of the Islanders mean shaft all to you? They live there and work there, and have done all their lives, surely their opinion is a whole lot more valid than yours.

You can't seriously be saying Argentina has any claim to the Falklands. For them to take sovereignity, they would also need to 'invade and colonise'.

The Falklands were British before Argentina ever laid a claim to them.
 
 
Did the Argentinians ever actually "have" the Falklands?

Not worried about interuptions in the cocaine supply line either. Colombia produces 90% of the world's cocaine and the Colombians hate the Venezuelans - they'd welcome a nuclear attack on Caracas.

So, nothing to worry about.

No, Argentina has never ruled or colonized the islands.

Spain did briefly, but they were neither the first nor the last and their presence lasted a few years compared to centuries under the UK. This period was before Argentina ever existed. France has a stronger claim then Spain, being there before Spain. Also, Argentina is not the successor state to Spain and is not entitled to pursue [weak] Spanish claims.

No. Spain had it for a while (about 200 years ago) when what is now Argentina was still owned by Spain. Argentina itself has never held the Falklands.

Didn't they rule by de facto on various occassions? I might be wrong! But I think when they invaded in 82 they had de facto control for several months until Britain reclaimed the islands. I'm sure others know more about that than me though.

Contrary to what politicians will tell us, Trident is not an independent system. Gordon Brown and Tony Blair used to say that we don't need America's permission to launch our nuclear weapons but most people in-the-know would disagree.
- Trident was designed by America
- Almost all of the major components of Trident are made in America
- The weapons that are supposedly "ours" are serviced in Georgia, USA
- Devonport Naval Dockyard in Plymouth (where all of our subs are serviced) is owned by Halliburton, a US corporation with close ties to the American government (Dick Cheney is a former chairman and CEO)
- The Aldermaston factory where the bombs are made is co-managed by Lockheed Martin, an American defence contractor

The British nuclear deterrent is essentially a franchise of the US nuclear deterrent, and our friends over the Atlantic could cut it off almost instantly if UK nuclear foreign policy didn't agree with US policy.

Have you ever thought to look at the facts instead of relying on the corporate media?
Every election Chavez has won has been through democratic means,and no substaniated claims of vote-rigging or any other kind of illegality has arisen from any election since 1998,and have been internationally recognised as legitimate.
And the issue of the closure of RCTV has been the subject of huge misreporting in the western media.The fact is it was never closed, and is still available on cable and satellite. However, when RCTV’s license to use the public airwaves, free of charge, came up for renewal, it was denied. Considering that RCTV helped carry out the US supported coup against Venezuelan democracy in 2002, one can only be amazed that this is the only restriction they have received.
It would be similar to the BBC actively encouraging a revolt against the Government.
But ask yourself why Chavez is so loathed by the West. It's not that he is a 'threat to democracy',it's what he represents.
The emergence of mass social movements from the left in Latin America has signalled the end of hegemonic dominance by the US on the hemisphere,and the resistance against US corportate interests,something that the right-wing dictatorships happily obliged too,and resistance to the empire cannot be tolerated can it?
Also the main policy of Chavez was the nationalisation of the oil. Now correct me if I am wrong,but this was the same crime that the democratically elected goverment of Iran under Mossadegh committed,and what was the result? The toppling of his government by the CIA in 1953 and the reversal back to the Shah,who would happily bleed his country dry for western businesses while he made a hefty amount.
Venezuela is not perfect,but it is by no means what you are incorrectly asserting.

A very concise and well thought out statement  
His warmongering aside, you can't really question Chavez's democratic record - he has legitimately won 3 elections that were all verified by international observers.
The reason he has such a questionable reputation is because he is opposed to the US' neoliberal agenda - power and profit to the masses rather than power and profit to the few. And when leaders don't get in line behind America, we all know what happens...
 
 
Idiot doesn't realise he's doing more harm to their cause than good, he is just making it more likely the US will weigh in on our side.

Exactly,dissent against the hegemon cannot be tolerated,and the rise of the left in Latin America has directly questioned the dominance of the US.
Neoliberalism has no moral standards,it doesn't care about democracy,it cares about profit,and Chavez' rise has set a worrying precedent for the US in the region.
The US involvement in the failed 2002 coup showed this,and the intense propaganda against him has shown that his failure to conform to American interests will not be tolerated,and this will continue until he has gone,and the nautral order of corporate dominance will be restored.

I love Hugo Chavez for these exact stunts. He's funnier than Boris.
 
 
Chavez might seem like a dictator etc. to the outside world but democracy isn't necessarily the best policy for many countries and remember Venezualans like Chavez in general.

Venezuala and Argentina will present a very big challenge to the UK, remember that they both have developed militaries- not as good as the UK's but certainly will give it a fight (imagine Rey Mysterio vs. the Great Khali in wrestling). Nuclear Weapons- as anyone with common sense will realise- will NOT be used in this type of conflict as the UK mainland isn't being threatened and the enemy isn't launching strikes against the cities etc. In the end, the Brits will most likely win but many, many more troops will die in 2 months of a war against Argentina and Venezuala than in 9 years of Afghanistan and 6 years of Iraq combined. Not to mention the huge economic cost of reinforcing the forces already there.

On the topic of who SHOULD have the Islands, I'am not really sure- both countries have good reasons I suppose.

You must learn to see beyond population figures and size of countries and realise that these places have very weak states that can be shattered easily. It is difficult to appreciate how weak the state is in some foreign countries when you're used to living in the UK - where state presence throughout its territory is one of the highest in the world.

 

You're so epically wrong it's untrue.
Ignoring the ******** comparisons between Iraq and Brazil.
In the last decade, Brazil has undergone one of the largest military-wide upgrades in the world. They've bought dozens of of helicopters under license from Eurocopter. Bought 4 Scorpène class submarine. Are negotiating to buy 120 Rafaele fighter jet's from the French; bought 12 attack helicopters from Russia; purchased 95 Super Tucanos; ordered 10 Black Hawks from the US and announced plans to purchase or build 2 aircraft carriers, 4 LHDs, 30 escort ships, 15 submarines, 5 nuclear submarines and 62 (patrol ships).
That's not a weak military.

The term 'Britain', in the modern world, is a synonym for the UK.
 
 
As far as I'm concerned, Argentina and what looks increasingly like a Latin America League can shove it. British territory with British citizens - there's nothing to dispute. Why should we give it back when there's no claim? That's to say we wanted to give it back anyway. Look at Gibraltar, it's the same thing.

The Venezuelan people have voiced there opinion on Chavez,through three democratic Presidential Elections,as the results have been in favour of him by 56%,59% and 62% respectively.
He was elected on the basis of ending US dominance that has plagued the continent,bleeding it dry of its resources,and part of that was the nationalisation of key industries,which would allow profits to be put back into the state,and not a western corporations.radical I know.
I take it you know about US involvement in Latin America and understand what Chavez' rise to power symbolised,and why this was so loathed by the West,and specifically our compassionate hegemon.
Besides the subjective claim of the BBC being 'left-leaning',that really isn't the point.The Beeb is an institution of the establishment,and this is reflected in its reporting internationally,reporting the accepted truths of those in power.
A good arcticle on the BBC and Venezuela is at  http://www.venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/5141  which will address what you are asking about it's reporting better than I could.
However it's not just the misreporting of the BBC,its an institutional problem within the mass media,and thats because how Chavez' defiance of the Washington Consensus is in direct contradiction to the interests of the corporate media like Murdoch and co,and as mentioned before, that cannot be tolerated.

You must learn to see beyond population figures and size of countries and realise that these places have very weak states that can be shattered easily. It is difficult to appreciate how weak the state is in some foreign countries when you're used to living in the UK - where state presence throughout its territory is one of the highest in the world.

 

You ARE special aren't you?

1) Africa is not a country.

2) Brazil can't be invaded by the UK even if they withdrew from Afghanistan and sent all available troops. The country's too large and the Brazilian military's by far the strongest in the region- not as technologically advanced as Britain's but most of the way there and also numerically superior. Nukes? The Brits won't use them due to the long term global and social consequences. Also Brazil has the technology to develop its own nukes within a very short time

3) You're extremely, extremely dumb, the Iraqi military had been the most modern in the region in the 1970's but had been decimated by the Iran-Iraq war and the remaining forces of any value had been wiped away in the First Gulf War. After that war, it was easily the worst military in the region and unable to even maintain its old, decaying military than buy new weapons due to viciously harsh Western sanctions. When the Americans came the Iraqi military practically didn't exist and its shambolic soldiers all deserted within hours

But in all seriousness what claim does Argentina have? If this man supports democracy he will support the Falklands right to stay with the United Kingdom as they want.

 

So if a majority of Scotland vote in favour of independence, will you support there right to?
 
 
I am in full support of Mr Chavez. Britain still think this is colonial times and they rule half the world. However, it was wrong to address the queen as she is completely useless!

British Armed forces are severely stretched, under funded and struggling to pay for Equipment

Venezuela is no Zimbabwe or Iraq. It has a well trained army with the latest Russian Weapons.

The UK would have to supply troops from Miles away, it would not have the advantage of an ally in latin america like we did in 1982

Britian may win, but Im sure in the process it would come out with more than a broken nose

edit : Iraq Military was ruined by 2003, thanks to 10 years of Sanctions by EVERYONE, if we want to invade all of Latin America well need the entire world to sanction them

i think this is a way of the world getting back and American and British
 
 
I love that Chavez is backing this, I hope we get involved, you guys can have argentina and we'll take Venezuela

Scottish independence has absolutely nothing to do with the Falklands. apart from anything else it will only happen if the majority of Scotland wants it to.

Argentina is ignoring the will of the islanders. hence your point is redundant.

Why do idiots keep using the fact that Argentina is closer to the Falklands than the UK as an argument that they should belong to Argentina? As another poster on here said: "Argentina has as much right to the Falklands as we have to France, ie. none". If you looked at a map properly you'd notice the islands are still several 100 miles away from Argentina anyway, ie. Britain is many times closer to France than Argentina is from the Falklands.

Putting aside the fact the islanders are British and wish to remain so, Britain has had control of the Falklands since before Argentina even existed. Spain would have a more reasonable claim than Argentina.

As for your later posts about whether it is worth fighting for the Falklands, I would certainly argue it is. We should take an absolutely zero tolerance policy with Argentina and continue to increase our military presence in the South American waters. Let's not forget that 60bn barrels of British oil are worth an awful lot of money, but more importantly we have a duty to protect our citizens.

Oh sod off. You ignore the important fact that the Island's inhabitants want to remain as a British colony. Argentina NEVER had a legitimate claim to the Islands. Chavez is using his state owned TV channel to ignite a flame, trying to draw attention away from increasing turbulence in his own conutry.

You talk absolute ********. States and nations are not defined by geography but by culture and a mutual desire to form a political unit together. The Falklands, inhabited by the descendents of British colonists and have been flying a British flag for centuries and practising a British culture - with to remain in political union with the UK.

Claiming land simply on the basis of it's proximity is imperialism. The Falklands wants to be part of the UK and there is a cultural basis for this.

The European Union is an implicit mutual defence pact. You must remember that Brits will be defenders here, protecting the right of people to remain in political union with the UK against a foreign imperialistic power.*

I would see hundreds of thousands dead if it was necessary - war would not of been a British choice but an action forced on the UK by aggressive imperialists.

*What's their best claim? Spain had a colony on it for a few years a couple of centuries ago?   Last time I checked, Argentina wasn't even Spain and didn't even exist then! How can you claim something that was never even part of your nation and has another culture?!

 

Don't swear at me. The self-determination of a few thousand people I respect, but when there's risk of bloodshed - is this necessary? Why must war be forced upon us? We live in the diplomatic age where we do not need to whip our guns out at every given opportunity.

The islanders may want to remain British. But when in history have colonisers ever listened to the colonised? Did Britain do so in 1833?

And please, please can people stop insulting each other.

Seriously, shut up.

 

But on what basis do Britain hold a legitimate claim to the Islands? The fact they re-established their rule in 1833 and then populated it with their own citizens doesn't mean they have a 'legitimate' claim.
The fact it was re-established during the time of the British Empire hardly does the UK any favours,and the fact it is on the opposite side of the planet lets the old colonialist argument prevail for critics of what was a meaningless island until Thatcher needed to win an election and now it's found it has oil.Convenient.

Sorry, but that's about as legitimate as humanly possible. It could not get any more legitimiate. Do you want a certificate of ownership from God or something? Humour us, what would make it legitimate.

For an Anarchist, you're not doing a very good job of giving people the freedom to make their own decisions.

We have the right to interfere in the Falkland islands until the people of the Falkland islands tell us they don't want us there anymore.

It's a mixture of citizenry. British control has resided over Spanish, French, Argentinians and British settlers. We left there in 1776 without renouncing our claim. It's all very well saying this is colonial clap-trap, but the point remains. British citizens remain on British soil, and we should do whatever we can to protect their interests. If anyone has another claim to the Island, it's Spain and France, not Argentina.

Chavez is trying to paper over cracks.

It's not over-analysis, it's fact. Chavez is trying to get his public to look elsewhere. Settlers there want to remain part of Britian. There is no debate.

The point im making is the principle is the same in both cases, yet there are a lot of people who arguing in the case of Falklands that we should take into account the opinion of the people who live there, but these same people do not apply the same logic to Scotland.

Please explain to me at what point this logic has not applied to Scotland? there has not been a referendum and the SNP govern as a minority government. There is no question of sovereignty when it comes to Scotland because Scotland is part of the U.K, the SNP do not argue against this point.

Plus its not like Ireland is claiming Scotland as their own which would be similar to the situation in the Falklands.

  If you fill a remote island with a states citizens,then they obviously going to wish to stay part of the state.Hardly surprising is it.
Similar to how the colonisation of Ulster through the plantations evolved into a significant population of Unionists,and then wanted to stay part of the Union.Do they have a legitimate claim as they have become part of its very existence?and are they a lasting legacy of the colonial age which should not be sustained?

There is no real legitimacy in territorial aquisition,however the view that the Falklands are an actual part of the Union has just become the institutionalised view.The inhabitants there are not indigenous,they are settlers,and should not be seen as nothing other than settlers.

  The Falklands have become an archaic manifestation of a colonial age the world thought they had rid themselfes of.
Neither the Argentinians or the British have a real 'legitimate' claim to the islands,it's just amusing to see apologists of the Empire still claiming this is sacred British territory.

I'd take another look if I were you. I'd fight every other country in South America before I took on Brazil.

The Conservatives as a unionist party are against Scottish independence and would be regardless of the opinion of the Scottish people, yet it was the same Conservative party who used the same arguments as you to validate British ownership of Falklands.

If the UK applied its strength it will break the back of Argentina and Venezuela. The world is full of people from the third world thinking a few cities with electric cabling and Russian hand-me-down aircraft suddenly make a world power.  

 

1) Brazil is one of the most POWERFUL countries the UK can choose to fight. It's conventional military can easily equal the force the UK sends across the Atlantic (won't be much as you don't have enough ships to carry the whole army). The budget of the Brazilian military is $22bn while that of the Iraqi military was not even $1bn before the invasion. The Iraqi military was VERY poorly equipped when the US invaded- it was strong in the 1970's and then became crap after the Iran-Iraq war. Here's a report by the centre for defense information, published mere months before the invasion:  http://www.cdi.org/friendlyversion/p...documentID=607 . Pretty much proves I was right in calling you extremely dumb. Some quotes from the source: 1) By the war's end, his armed forces were militarily devastated (having been heavily defeated if not totally destroyed)... 2) all Iraqi divisions (except those of the Republican Guard) are estimated by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) to be at 50 percent combat effectiveness, with half of all Army equipment lacking spare parts. 3) IISS also cites the serviceability of the Iraqi fixed wing aircraft at around 55 percent, with serviceability of helicopters 'poor.' Further, according to IISS, senior pilots are averaging only 90-120 flying hours per year, with junior pilots having as little as 20 hours of flight time.

2) The Brazilian military at the present could have very easily flattened the Iraqi military just before the US invasion and also easily beaten the Iraqi military in 2003. As said before the Brazilian military budget is $22bn. The Iraqi military at the moment is far, far better equipped than under Saddam due to the lifting of sanctions and massive US help and yet its budget's barely $3bn and it's nowhere near Brazil in terms of military tech.

3) The Taliban have not lost, NATO has not lost, both are still fighting. Stop making assumptions dip ****. And yes I'am a jihadist immigrant- not really surprised you're launching unjustified personal attacks after your BS post.

4) The first world is full of people thinking they actually have the balls to go to war against a decent military. By the way Afghanistan didn't have a military, North Vietnam a **** one and Iraqis a terrible one as well. Just over 250 UK soldiers tragically dead in Afghanistan and the public's going nuts over the troops being under-equipped and the "massive" casualties. Attack Brazil and that many will be killed in an hour.

5) You are extremely extremely dumb. Where did you a degree from? Media Studies at the University of Ignorance?  

6) You probs won't reply to this as you've been comprehensively owned.

I honestly feel like smashing my head against a brick wall here. Scottish people have not voted for independence and it is not a certainty that they will. The conservatives do oppose Scottish independence as do Labour, The Liberal Democrats and the majority of Scotland's newspapers.

There is no link, and there never will be a link between Argentina's claim to the Falklands and Scotland's independence. You are either a troll or just completely stupid.

If you argue that Britian should retain control of the Falklands because the inhabitants favour it, how can you argue against Scottish independence IF the people of Scotland favour it. Also i didnt say anything about Argentina's claim to the Falklands.

Just because the Tories advocate a Unionist position does not mean should Scotland vote for Independence that they will stand in the way. There is no way in that situation that they could stand in the way of it.

And by the way in relation to another post of yours Britain has acted in favour of self determination in Northern Ireland. The majority want to stay part of the U.K. Im not sure where you live but having a grasp of what you are actually talking about often helps.

AFAIK, Northern ireland is run by a Unionist party. Therefore, that tells you all you need to know about Northern Ireland. What 'Double Standards'?

Argentina wouldn't dare invade, risking Internation condemnation.

Argentina can't afford to invade the Falklands anyway. Right now, it's broke and has to find $13 billion to service its debts. It isn't going to raise those kinds of funds by going into a full scale military conflict with a major world power.
Britain would probably be pushed to send an effective task force, but Argentina would be committing economic and political suicide invading in the first place. A conflict won't happen because neither side has the stomach, the resources or the bank balance for it.

Argentina is poor yes, which is why it has 250 Billion or 1 trillion Reasons to invade depending on which reports you believe

Argentina is already a basket case... It has nothing to loose

I've been precise twice in this thread so far.

The term Britain, in today's world, is a synonym for the UK - for someone with a first and masters in the subject you should be able to comprehend that.

The Falklands are a strategically useful island, its not just about self determination, a colonial past and oil. If the Panama canal becomes unusable the Falkland’s are a good, safe stopping off point for British shipping going that way to the pacific, same with the Suez canal if your going the other way. This is what my mate who is an officer in the RN told me anyway.

People need to stop being so defeatist and negative about Britain’s place in the world, we are still a bigish player and I don’t intend on giving that up any time soon. You don’t see the French, Spanish or American people willing to give up territory around the world, so why should we.

The islanders may want to remain British. But when in history have colonisers ever listened to the colonised? Did Britain do so in 1833?

And please, please can people stop insulting each other.

 

Yes, yes it bloody well would be necessary.

How someone can take such a careless view of freedom in the face of what would be the oppressive use of force by a foreign power astounds me. That you think it is somehow noble to be cowed on such important issues by petty threats is inexplicable.

Argentina has no legitimate claim to the islands. That they're closer is a complete irrelevance, and the right of the Falkland Islanders to self-determination is certainly not. Of course, the right of a state to protect its own sovereign territory is no small issue either.

Freedom is worth fighting for, and if it ever came to it, as it did last time, then bloodshed would be completely justified. The Argentinians have literally no claim to the islands, so I don't see why anyone should even be talking about sorting out the issue through negotiations. They're our islands, and that should be the end of the debate.

The Brits won't use them due to the long term global and social consequences. Also Brazil has the technology to develop its own nukes within a very short time

3) You're extremely, extremely dumb, the Iraqi military had been the most modern in the region in the 1970's but had been decimated by the Iran-Iraq war and the remaining forces of any value had been wiped away in the First Gulf War. After that war, it was easily the worst military in the region and unable to even maintain its old, decaying military than buy new weapons due to viciously harsh Western sanctions. When the Americans came the Iraqi military practically didn't exist and its shambolic soldiers all deserted within hours

 

actually there regular army has about the same ammount of people as our regs, there reserve army is alot larger than ours but as far as air power and sea power go were miles ahead.

Well personally, as Milliband stated, the waters DO NOT belong to Argentina, it would be an insult to all those British soldiers who died out there if we just "gave them back".

Secondly, Mr Chavez, Address the Foreign Secretary not the Queen, you Venezuelan numbskull!

Thirdly, Oil off the coast of the Falklands! - Finally! There is actually something useful over there, funny how these nations take the Falklands seriously now isn't it?

Come on, let Britain have some oil too! If it were the islands were under US sovereignty, the 60 billion barrels would be extracted by now, Chavez wouldn't even dare questioning the big boys to their north.

Personally, I'm surprised he has the guts to attack our foreign policy, the thing is, what are they going to do, declare war on us and get their asses kicked? It would be the shortest war in history. Not to mention the fact that the UN won't listen to their claim, the Argentines have been playing that card throughout the last century.

Ahead but not miles ahead, look up the Brazilian Air Force- it's actually surprisingly strong. Regardless an attack on Brazil will not happen as even of its military's weaker than the UK's, it's still too powerful to attack.

The budget of the Brazilian military is $22bn while that of the Iraqi military was not even $1bn before the invasion. The Iraqi military was VERY poorly equipped when the US invaded- it was strong in the 1970's and then became crap after the Iran-Iraq war. Here's a report by the centre for defense information, published mere months before the invasion:  http://www.cdi.org/friendlyversion/p...documentID=607 . Pretty much proves I was right in calling you extremely dumb. Some quotes from the source: 1) By the war's end, his armed forces were militarily devastated (having been heavily defeated if not totally destroyed)... 2) all Iraqi divisions (except those of the Republican Guard) are estimated by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) to be at 50 percent combat effectiveness, with half of all Army equipment lacking spare parts. 3) IISS also cites the serviceability of the Iraqi fixed wing aircraft at around 55 percent, with serviceability of helicopters 'poor.' Further, according to IISS, senior pilots are averaging only 90-120 flying hours per year, with junior pilots having as little as 20 hours of flight time.

2) The Brazilian military at the present could have very easily flattened the Iraqi military just before the US invasion and also easily beaten the Iraqi military in 2003. As said before the Brazilian military budget is $22bn. The Iraqi military at the moment is far, far better equipped than under Saddam due to the lifting of sanctions and massive US help and yet its budget's barely $3bn and it's nowhere near Brazil in terms of military tech.

3) The Taliban have not lost, NATO has not lost, both are still fighting. Stop making assumptions dip ****. And yes I'am a jihadist immigrant- not really surprised you're launching unjustified personal attacks after your BS post.

4) The first world is full of people thinking they actually have the balls to go to war against a decent military. By the way Afghanistan didn't have a military, North Vietnam a **** one and Iraqis a terrible one as well. Just over 250 UK soldiers tragically dead in Afghanistan and the public's going nuts over the troops being under-equipped and the "massive" casualties. Attack Brazil and that many will be killed in an hour.

5) You are extremely extremely dumb. Where did you a degree from? Media Studies at the University of Ignorance?  

6) You probs won't reply to this as you've been comprehensively owned.

And the freedom of over 3,000 British citizens?

There is a chance that negotiations could break down and tensions could rise. Would you suggest we just allow self-determined British citizens to submit to the rule of a foreign power they do not want?

The only nation emitting imperialistic undertones is Argentina.
 
 
Saying Argentina is poor so it wont attack the Falklands is a Flawed argument

A) Argentina stands to make near 1 trillion dollars from the Oil Fields
B) The British Navy is not Capable of protecting the Falklands in an event of a Full South American Military assault

Brazil have no reason to attack the Falklands, so we would have no reason to attack them. Regardless, if a war was fought over the Falklands (which it 99.999999999% won't be) it would come close to a world war.

I know the other members of NATO have to help us if we are invaded but does that also apply to the Falklands or just the UK?

there are alot of very naive posts on this thread.

Whilst there is a continental agreement to back argentina, this is via diplomatic means.

only venezuela, and allegedly ecuador, guatemala and chile are going to supply military support.

whilst venezuela has been making significant arms purchases from russia in recent years, they are only fooling themselves if they think they have the resources to deploy their military to the other side of the continent.

it is not as simple as weighing up the combined miltary power of several weak nations against the other powerful opponent.

the one single opponent is likely to be far more organised, the weak nations are likely tovery limited ability to act with any ral pattern.

it takes years and years of practice to get it right.

secondly, the anti imperialist rhetoric has consequences for france.
france has a sizeable portion of territory called french guiana located very close to venezuela. if the uk does not get eu support it will set a precedent. how long before they turn their attention to this lst french colony? france will be well aware of this.

lastly, it is unimaginable to think that any regional war would take place without the backing of our allies.

the united states will not sit by you mark my words.

which speaks volumes of obamas failing as president. His inexperience may cost us big in this argument.

whatever you say about george bush...he stuck up for his allies and for freedom. if bush was in office he would have already made it clear to argentina "hands off of the falklands"

obama is an absolute amature at foreign affairs.

I think you are missing the point. I took Mr. Chavez' address to be largely ironic, in that the former colony of the Falklands is a much a relic of the British Empire as the Queen is.

The issue of sovereignty is rather complex in this case and the history of the island dates back several years but immediate concerns are most certainly economic as the island may well be above a profitable oil well. The way I see it is that it was an island that Britain staked a claim for, and they were simply the best equipped to defend that claim, being a world superpower with overwhelming Naval might at the time that British rule was established.
The Empire has, as Chavez rightly stated, been dismantled long ago and there is really no need for us to cling to it. I would suggest, as traumatic as it may well be for the remaining residents, some sort of repatriation system to bring them back to Britain should they no longer wish to live under an Argentinian government - and yet as far as I understand it, they would retain as much independence from Argentina as they currently enjoy from Britain, and a similar model would be Hong Kong for which Britian had a 99-year lease and who, upon return to Chinese governance, still maintained moderate independence.

British colonisation had a devastating effect on many, many people and personally I am amazed that more of you are not utterly ashamed of it. I guess apologists like me are showing just one too many signs of weakness

What a pathetic argument, one that has been trotted out too many times to count, and probably cost far too many lives to count as well. Because of mistakes made by politicians (here's looking at you, Thatcher) people died. And we should continue on the wrong course to "honour" their deaths, with what, more deaths? More people should die for the wrong reasons, just to protect those soldier's memories? So, so wrong.
No islands are under "US sovereignty" because the United States have never been a colonial power, they have never had an Empire, and they detest the whole idea - one of their proudest moments was liberation from the British Empire, and that is why they are very lukewarm about this issue. Morally, America does not agree with it. It is not Obama being "weak" it is a traditional American standpoint.

If there was a viable oil well - which I suggested as a possibility - then right now, at this moment, we have full control over it. Venezuela piped up probably because they are strong members of OPEC - Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries - and Venezuela, famously, destroyed privatised investment in their oil industry. Companies such as Shell getting their hands on any potential oil in the region would be a blow, and that is probably why Chavez felt the need to open his mouth. I do agree, the sooner we allow the companies to export that oil for British gain the better.

The monarchy transcends and predates the British Empire.

 
The Empire has, as Chavez rightly stated, been dismantled long ago and there is really no need for us to cling to it.
 

Clinging on to notions of imperialism would be if we were to ignore the self-determination of the Falklands, in the case of them wishing to be under Argentinian rule. We are protecting their democratic right to self-determination.

The only nation emitting elements of imperialism is Argentina. They have very little claim to the Falklands, and the people wish to remain British. Being in close proximity is not a legitimate justification; therefore, to wish to expand their territory and claim the islands is imperialistic in itself.

 
I would suggest, as traumatic as it may well be for the remaining residents, some sort of repatriation system to bring them back to Britain should they no longer wish to live under an Argentinian government
 

So, you believe we should remove families from their homes, jobs, lives and eradicate an entire culture to appease a foreign nation which has very little to base its claim on the islands? What planet are you on?

This also sounds awfully fascist if it refers to Argentina. Taking over foreign land and deporting dissenters?

 
British colonisation had a devastating effect on many, many people and personally I am amazed that more of you are not utterly ashamed of it. I guess apologists like me are showing just one too many signs of weakness  
 

Why should we be ashamed of something which occurred in the past? Should the French be ashamed of their forefathers for invading Britain? Should Italy be ashamed of the Roman Empire?

I am amazed by the amount of anti-democratic, self-loathers who harp on about 'imperialism' and 'colonisation' but fail to recognise the inhabitants' right to self-determination.

Oh, and look up the word 'apologist'.

the usa did have an empire and still does unofficially.

the phillipines were colonised by america for many years

soon after the united states gained independence, there were attempts to annex canadian territory.. it was britain who stopped this.

lastly the many states of the united states are indeed colonies,, the natives were wiped out and replaced with american settlers.

i suppose you dont even know that texas and calafornia were once a part of mexico.

here is something you make like to know...for a territory to be a colony it does not have to be isolated from the main nation by sea.

annexing can be a form of colonisation.

when the usa gained independece from great britain there were 13 states...what happened that it suddenly expanded to over 50?

America is also a comparatively young country compared to Britain etc. - a major reason for them not having an empire.

It is somewhat laughable to suggest the USA has some sort of moral high ground on colonial empires. When the US was founded they expanded from the East Coast to the West Coast stripping Native Indians of their land, they bought large areas of land off the French (and other countries I think), invaded what is now Florida (then controlled by Spain) and took California and a lot of what is now the South West from Mexico after a war. I'm sure there are a couple more examples but I can't remember them anymore.
 
 
Since its military was defeated by a British Task Force after invading the islands in 1982, Argentina has sought support for its proposal of a negotiated settlement through the UN.

The UN has called for talks to settle the dispute but they have no force in law without the backing of the Security Council where the UK is a permanent member with the right of veto.

Owned Argentina.
 
 
brazil will not get involved in any latin league. the word in brasila is that the president is not happy with chavez and also they would not want the argies to have the falklands oil as that would threaten brazil's position as richest country on the continent.

if chavez and argentina attacked the falklands, columbia (with the 2nd best military on the continent), perhaps with yank backing would attack chavez.

on another note, while chavez's election wins have been fair he forced through laws keeping him in office

In Britain we're always taught that the British Empire was a bad thing, if we're taught about it at all ( I was never taught about it). Yes, it did have negative effects on many countries, however, it had positive effects on many aswell. Look at the leading nations, how many of them were British colonies? Britain gave them the infrastructure to be able to be world leaders.

The fact that the citizens don't want to be Argentianian is reason enough for the UK to defend thier islands. The fact that there's billions worth of oil there is an even greater incentive. They wont be given up without a fight.

I refer you to the overthrowing of the monarchy of the Kingdom of Hawaii and the signing of the Bayonet Constitution under duress in 1887.

America has rather significant amounts of overseas territories (Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam and so on), as well as substantial numbers of overseas bases. America's empire is not territorial in the same sense as the UK or France - it is cultural. The reason Obama has come down so lukewarm on this issue is because he doesn't give a d@mn. He shouldn't, really, as he has bigger fish to fry. The Americans don't detest the concept of empire necessarily; from a territorial standpoint, yes. They typically favour the all-pervasive commerce and education route. They may pretend they care, but morally they don't give a ha'penny toss.

Britain built an empire to economically exploit the locals

America decided it would be better to overthrow democratic regimes / Dictators who help their countries,. It overthrew the regimes and replaced them with Either Direct Rule from the US military or instilled a democratic/Dictator who would sign lots of deals with america and allow america to exploit the locals 'legally'

They may be conscripts, but if the Argentines, with their democratically elected government, ever again decided to go to war on the issue, the blood would be entirely on their hands.

For the non-aggressors, defending the freedoms of the Falkland Islanders and their right to self determination would be perfect justification. Furthermore, it would be remiss to do anything else.

You are, essentially, a wuss who simply cannot see that some things are worth fighting for, and that some things are more important than death.

I'm making no more points. Since we have established that I'm a wuss and you're a big bad crusader who's willing to gun down anyone that gets in Britain's way, is there any further need to discuss?

You're not giving Britain as much credit as it deserves. Our empire instilled parliamentary democracy, a large amount of self-rule far before independence was on the table, solid education systems (former British territories are far and away the most literate countries in Africa despite their governance), and essential infrastructure. Few other colonising powers were even remotely as benevolent as the British.

On the other hand, you're spot on about America. The CIA's involvement in some truly horrendous stuff down south (United Fruit Company, anyone?) is pretty potent, especially as it happened relatively recently in historical terms. For anyone interested in that topic, have a look at the film "The Good Shepherd" with Matt Damon.

Well I suppose not. I've made my views clear, and if you truly persist in the ludicrous and frankly offensive belief that defending the rights and freedoms of thousands of people is equivalent to self-interested imperialism and mindless slaughter, then I have nothing more to say to you either.

Im sorry, Britain instilling Parliamentary democracy(that style of government is not suited to everywhere
) and self rule ? yes if the country your talking about what 'White' e.g Australia and Canada, but Places like India and Hong Kong were ruled by British appointed rulers

When British gave independence to the countries, they left them in a 'relatively ' worst position to Britain to when they were first colonized. Britain left in such a hurry that most occasion the country was taken over by Corrupt Militias (under the front of political parties), just as we saw in the Fall of the Soviet Union, when the Mafia amassed huge power after sudden collapse

Iran 1950s was a joint British American operation to overthrow the nationalist yet secular government of Iran

What separates America from Britain, is Britain went around planting the British Flag for the empire, America went around planting the Corporate America Flag for Wall Street

Gets in Britain's way? You imply Britain is the one pushing here; whereas, Britain is the party who is maintaining its legitimate position. The only party pushing here is Argentina.

I'm sure we can find a similar thread of boastful arrogance and cockiness before we invaded Afghanistan to take on those AK-47 carrying, mule riding men with large beards and baggy robes.

India? thats 1 from about 50
Bearing in Mind india was the worlds largest Economy before the British came

and India being stable? yea?? what do you define as stable ? maybe india has been doing well the past 5 or 6 years but before that it was just as bad

Heard of the 'Hindu rate of growth'

1/3 of India is over run by Maoist Rebels--  http://indianvanguard.files.wordpres...p_20091026.jpg 

The country has more poverty,aids and malnutrition than all of africa put together

wealth of 36 families amounts to $ 191 billion, which is one-fourth of India’s GDP. In other words, 35 elite Hindu families own quarter of India’s GDP

Crime against Dalits occur every 20 minutes in India. Every day 3 Dalit women are raped, 2 Dalits are murdered and 2 Dalit houses are burnt down! These figures represent only a fraction of actual incidents since many Dalits do not register cases for fear of retaliation by the police and upper-caste Hindu individuals. Official figures show that there are still 0.343 million manual scavengers in India from Dalit community. More than 165 million Dalits in India are simply abused by their Hindu upper castes for their birth

On an average one Indian woman commits suicide every four hours over a dowry dispute.

Out of the 593 districts in India, 378 or 62.5 % are affected by human trafficking. In 2006, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) sponsored study conducted by Shakti Vahini, found that domestic violence, illiteracy, unemployment, poverty; unsafe migration and child marriage are the major reasons for the increasing rate of illegal human trafficking.

The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) placed India on its “Watch List” for 2009 because it found the Central government had failed to take effective measures to ensure the rights of religious minorities in several States.

Riots against Sikhs (1984) Muslims (2002) and Christian (2008) have resulted in a huge wage of killings

Almost every state has separatist movements, many of them armed. A large number of Muslims were killed in the past few years across the country and the numbers are on a steady rise. On top of that India has become a paraya for its neighbours. None of its neighbours appreciate their closeness to India and they all blame it for meddling in their affairs.

Recently, a national report on the employment situation in India has warned that nearly 30 percent of the country’s 716 million-strong workforce will be without jobs by 2020. Government of India doesn’t have the resources or political will to find jobs for such a large population.

India is failing to provide food shelter and clothing for her citizens. India has bloody borders. India has had wars with all her neighbors. By harping on the “failed state” mantra the bigoted Indian commentariat wants to surround “Akhand Bharat” with small Balkanized mini-states like Sikkim, Bhutan, Sri Lanka. Any hegemonous power achieves its goal in the region by sabotaging the integrity and sovereignty of the neighbors. India wants to surround itself with a “Warsaw pact” type of string of obsequies and subservient states. Pakistan is big hurdle in India’s hegemonistic policy of Westward expansion. Since the West never faced “India” in combat, they are unaware of the (South) Indian agression that was encountered by Southeast Asia (Laos, Cambodia, and even Indonesia).

Sudra Holocaust: Genocide of 1 million Dalits in India since 1947: About three million Dalit women have been raped and around one million Dalits killed from the time of Independence. This is 25 times more than number of soldiers killed during the wars fought after independence. That is why Dalits do not need Aryan culture or Hindu Dharma based on caste any more. …” [Dr. Tulsiram

India scored worse than nearly 25 sub-Saharan African countries and all of South Asia, except Bangladesh,” the report says.
When Indian states are compared to countries in the Global Hunger Index, [the central Indian state of] Madhya Pradesh ranks between Ethiopia and Chad,” it says.
India is long known to have some of the highest rates of child malnutrition and mortality in under-fives in the world.
According to the Indian government statistics two years ago, around 60% of more than 10 million children in the state were malnourished (International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) along with Welthungerhlife and the University of California)

And you call India a success story ?? Last time I checked Cuba and Philippines were much more stable

I have no doubt our technology is top Class. Im sure the entire continent would in some form or another support Argentina. I have no Doubt we could defend Britian from an attack. But the Falklands is another story, so far away from Britain, and in the view of many experts not me, Britain does not have enough escort boats. And yes we would be alone, america would not volunteer troops to help, we saw what america thinks of us during the Iraq enquiry

Blair : We go to war in Iraq in return, you cut some tariffs on British goods
Bush : No
Blair : aah what the heck lets bomb Iraq

Last time round, the french sold them out, I doubt Argentina still uses french weapons

but no matter what, if Falklands is attacked, even if we have to introduce a new special war Tax, We should defend the Falklands,

But again, the whole continent would not band together, and submarines could own most of them.

The u.s may not send troops however there bases, oil (fuel) intelligence would sway it.
 
 
I'm sure if y'all prime minister asked President Obama for help he would more than be glad to give it.... well I hope god knows how much he loves alienating us from our allies.

[QUOTE]

no you misunderstand the situation there.

Brazil would more likely support us, as we buy lots of their timber, uraguay wouldn't support argentina either. Columbia would attack argentina's ally venezuela with US help (they'd try to get rid of chavez)
Chile's new president is a right wing billionaire, can you see him helping a left-winger like chavez.

bolivia's president is a former priest who i can't see supporting war. Mexico would be put under us pressure not to go to war. so that leaves the military powerhouses of suriname, peru, and panama and that dosen't guarantee they would get involved anyway.

it comes down this: do we go against the wishes of those in the falklands who quite clearly want to stay british or do we give in to a second rate power and thier mad dog ally.
