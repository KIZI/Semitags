discuss.
 
 
Everyone complains about the NHS, but everybody needs it.
 
 
It's pretty great.
 
 
It probably is up there.
 
 
Yeah, it is brilliant. It's just hardly anybody stops complaining about it to think about what a wonderful institution it actually is. People don't appreciate the fact that we have free healthcare better than a lot of the world. They'd soon start missing it if it were gone.
 
 
I'd agree. Waching a documentry on its birth the other day really made respect Bevan and what he fought for.
Sure, criticise it all you want, but you must admire the principle of it.
 
 
Err, no. Not even close.

Things that are more important and have been achieved by the Government include a free and fair justice system, national security, economic wealth and the abolition of true poverty, free state education for all, etc etc etc.....

Without most of those things, the NHS wouldn't even exist.
 
 
We brits do have a problem with complaining, The NHS is an amazing system, everything has its flaws but the NHS gives everyone a safety net. I have been messed around and flatly refused private heath cover and without the NHS i would not get treatment (at least not without have to take all my families money).. i love the NHS - Shame on anyone who talks of detroying it

Forced to need it is a better way to put it.
 
 
becoming a democracy/giving women the vote was pretty great.

But yes, I think it's a fantastic if idealistic idea.
 
 
Consider this - the less well off of our society passing away from cancer which was not treated, being asked for proof of payment before receiving emergency treatment.

We should immensely proud of our National Health Service, and defend its merits bitterly.

Free at the point of need. It took great courage to establish the NHS and we all owe it a debt of honour.

The greatest thing a government has done in modern times.
 
 
yeah it was pretty great, wasn't first concieved in britain though.
 
 
the British NHS is, for all its problems and faults, a fairly fantastic organisation, and one that is rightly envied in the world. but as far as being the greatest thing a governement has ever done, im not 100% sure. it's up there, but there must be other things earlier on (eg. widening of democracy) that allowed the NHS to exist in the first place anyway.

that said, we should probably appreciate it more than we do, and the media flag up its negative aspects far more than its positive ones.
 
 
Its also the single biggest drain on the economy and encourages people not to look after their body.

However on the balance it's a pretty fantastic creation, you only have to look at America to see how **** their system is.
 
 
Nope. It's a fatally flawed system based on outdated socialist ideals, and could be improved by putting decisions in the hands of the individual.
 
 
I do think the NHS is pretty awesome.

I'm surprised none of the medics have jumped on you yet! Although this is a good idea in theory, it is a bit too idealistic. A lot of patients would make decisions about their own health that would be detrimental to them because they don't understand the full implications of their illness. It then becomes a question of whose responsibility is the patients health?
Interesting idea though.
 
 
NO NO NO

*insert standard piss poor deontological 'argument' riddled with abstractions and 'rights' here
 
 
 
national security, economic wealth
 

The security of our nation and wealth is more important than health?
what would be the point of all this wealth without health?

Or not...

The NHS is one of the Greatest Achievements of any British government, It has served this country well for the past 60 years, and i hope it will continue to serve us. I think its shocking when people say we should privatise the NHS and "put freedom in the hands of the individual", If we followed an Americanised system of health care, then we would lose our freedom, as we would ecome slaves to the HMO's who would have the power of life and death over us. I would rather give my Doctor the freedom to practice, with out having to check weather a patient can afford treatment, so they can do what they went into medicine to do - i.e. Save lives.

I agree with what Lodzinski said. The NHS is not one of the greatest things our Government has ever done.

well its a simple choice really Mr Libertarian. You either have the NHS, and everyone has access to health care, or, you privatise and thousands of people die. Take your libertarian cr*p else where. (quick question:- as a libertarian are you in favour of child porn?)

When its an issue of life and death, and where access to healthcare is concerned, you will be removeing peoples freedom to live when you privatise, and thats wrong, i dont care what any 18th Century enlightend philosoph says, a citizens right to free health care is more important than your ideology!
 
 
It's not a simple choice at all! if you privatise the system you would get great efficicency gains, and you could follow a singapore type system, where individuals must have a calamity level of insurance, to pay for major illnesses and injuries, which due to being fairly unsusceptible to fraud, and open to 60m people would be at a low cost, then allow people to decide how to spend their NI contributions by placing in a medical account, so the individual can decide the appropriate level of care. each to their own according to their means. a one size fits all healthcare system is regressive, and punishes people by giving them the minimum level of healthcare, regardless of whether or not they can afford it, as well as preventing the potential for cross subsidisation that greater individual choice brings.

free health care is not a right at all, it is a priviledge that has been abused by countless people for decades.

My Liberty is more important than your presumption of care.

Now let me ask you the questions. If healthcare is such an important right it has to be nationalised and put under state control, then why is the production and distribution of, say, bread not nationalised and put under the state's control? Surely, if your command economics are so superior, then the distribution and provision of the basic food-stuffs should also be under state control?

you might want to have a look at all the cases of citizens having to make the choice between which fingers they can afford to reattach, or those who die because their HMO says the treatment is "experimental" or those who die because their HMO says the treatment for their illness is not necessary.
Actually rather than me explaining it, just go watch sicko, if you want US style health care here (and it would be US style thanks to our special relationship), then thats what you will get.
 
 
As far as social systems go, the NHS is by no means the worst -- but nor is it the greatest thing the government has ever done. My (rather copious) experience tells me the NHS does need reforming, however.
 
 
don't bring america up as an example because it is the worst example of a privatised health system, and not what anyone here is advocating, so don't go shouting your mouth off about the US system being typical of all private health care systems, ad everyone knows it is a criminally wasteful inefficient system that would not be the same as what would be introduced in the UK were the NHS to be dismantled.

You might want to look at all the cases of people having to go private because the NHS refuses to give them drugs that have been tested and approved by the private sector but not accepted by the public sector, or all the people who have contracted MRSA, or all the other disasters in our medical system...

I guess Orwell just doesnt agree with either system.....

On topic:

I think the media definatly plays up the problems with the NHS in order to sell papers. Because it has been around for 60 years, i think many people who were born after its creation, have no idea of how bad it was before we had the NHS. Libertarians like Bagration might tell us that everything will be marvelous if we privatise, and oh dont worry about america, that sort of thing wont happen here, But without the security that the NHS provides, many of us wouldnt be alive to even have this debate. You may complain about the NHS now, but when its gone, then people will suffer! Libertarian ideas of Freedom and choice, dont apply to the comman man, they are only for the rich. "Capitalism leads to dole queues, the scramble for markets, and war." With Healthcare, what we really need is a welsh approach, get the private sector out of our NHS hospitals!
 
 
Although many here disagree with the idea of an NHS as I do, I must say that even I can admire the creation of the NHS. Britain was barely beginning to clear the rubble of the war, while its Empire fell away. Creating a National Health System at the level of Britain's is absolutely amazing considering the time and place. I don't think we could do it today.
 
 
the nhs is fantastic and is the best health care system in the world: people do not have to pay to receive a health service which is up to date and universally helps to cure people, the NHS does not care if you earn millions or if you are homeless, the service treats both in the same manner without a difference in the duty of care
 
 
The greatest thing the British gvernment has ever done?! No way near. If you haven't noticed we used to own a quarter of the globe. How about starting America and Australia? Bringing industry and agriculture to the remotest and off key parts of the world?

NHS is just a socialist money eating behemoth, just like all socialist programs. The sooner we privatise it the better for everyone.

Because you do not pay at the point-of-use does not actually make it free. You may have noticed that we pay tax in this country.

After fighting and defeating the fascists from 1939 to 1945, I reckon it was the greatest feat of British government in the twentieth century. It has saved millions of lives, and continues to do so.

In the US, the government at all levels will take about 31% of the national income in taxation. In the UK, it is about 40%. Out of the 40% of the national income taken by the government, 18% of the budget, or 7.2% of the national income as a whole, is spent on the NHS.

I think everyone in this country, rich or poor, would be happy to pay that 7.2% of their income on the NHS. I'd pay more, frankly. I simply must assume that most Americans would be willing to see their tax bill rise a little bit to finance a universal health-care system on the British model.

However, there are the figures. People will make their own judgement about how much they are prepared to pay, and whether or not they'd prefer American levels of taxation and the American health-care system.
 
 
Healthcare markets are the one thing that will ruin anybody arguing for libertarianism on the basis of efficiency. Cream skimming... adverse selection... externalities... healthcare is by far the best example of market failure. Markets have a role, but laissez faire will fail. Only the extreme rights based libertarians can sustain the notion of 100% privately operated healthcare.

My experience of hospitals on the continent (and I've been in a few) has been fantastic. Our health care system is by far not the envy of Europe.

Why are you harping on about "equality?" What you care about, should you ever be in need of prompt medical treatment in the US, is that you get the best care possible. That is undeniably available in the US.

It's not as if there is perfect, utopian "equality" in our system either. Currently, you'll have real difficulties obtaining Herceptin in some PCT's, but not in others. How is that conducive to "equality?"

I'd hope that was quite obvious, but we pay more taxes here than in, say, America. That's because we have to prop up the NHS, unlike the American taxpayer. Thus your claim that the NHS is "free" is rather fallacious, isn't it?

it was worse, the doctor looked at my foot, wrote something and charged 50 euros, she didnt even tell us where the pharmacy was in the town, also the doctor only came to the town once a week

becasue everyone should have the right to the same medical treatment regardless of their background. some of the PCT things in england are wrong but the PCTs have taken the decision which drugs they used as their money must be rationed somehow. in scotland herceptin is readily available IF the person is most suited to using that drug and not another. herceptin only works on a very small number of tumours anyway (oestrogen negative i think)

None of those were done by a Government though. They all evolved over time in various ways. The NHS was created by a single administration...
 
 
Although an institution born out of socialist values the NHS has wider appeal - indeed plenty of (though not all) Tories believe in the NHS and the principle that access to medical care in society shouldn't be limited to those who have wealth or privilege. We're very fortunate to have the NHS and much of the moaning about its provision grows out of rising expectations, not failings as such. It's also rather flawed to pick out examples of shortcomings in the NHS where such a truly huge and complex organisation is concerned to then present them as evidence of overall failure.

Reading some of the comments in this thread people seem to be very poorly informed, especially in regard to the American healthcare system. It would seem that people think that everyone is forced to pay insurance fees and those that do not are simply left to die, being refused treatment.

The reality is that those on low incomes and the elderly are covered by the Medicare and Medicaid state funded insurance, they don't need to pay for insurance nor will they be refused treatment. Similarily, I believe state hospitals cannot refuse anyone treatment in the case of an emergency. This is essentially a saftey net that is intended to ensure that those who are unable to meet the cost of their care are covered, while the system also encourages those on higher incomes be more personally responsible by seeking insurance, which will also ensure they recieve high quality care.

Many of the problems with the American health care system come from the practices of the insurance companies. There is certainly a need for reform of the insurance system, although countries like Singapore show that insurance systems can work very well. In Singapore they operate compulsary medical savings schemes that provide insurance for individuals and this has helped to create one of the efficient healthcare systems in the world, which maintains a high quality of care, especially when compared to it's neighbouring countries.

here's the outline of a bill I'm about to submit to the HoC for NHS reform:

It is proposed that

* Existing NHS hospitals, clinics, surgeries etc are placed in the hands of a private corporation, independent of and unaccountable to the government. (An industry watchdog in the mould of Ofcom, Ofwat etc will be set up to monitor the servic

e)

* The current system of National insurance is altered to: Contributions will still be taken from wages automatically, or provided by the benefits system should the individual not be in employment, but instead placed in a bank account under the stewardship of a financial institution of the individuals' choice, soley for the use of medical expenses.

* This way the individual can decide upon their level of care according to their means, and make an economic decision upon their healthcare.

* Upon death, the funds in the account will be divided equally among the next of kin. This way over generations, surplus funds will build up, and the level of healthcare affordable by all will rise, improving the overall health system, as well as allowing the tax burden to be reduced over time (as the level of funds in the account rise, the taxation level will fall)

* Individuals are free to choose any level of health insurance they please, but it must be at a minimum of a 'calamity' level, covering major illnesses and accidents. (incl. ambulance trips) By opening up this market 1: to only major illnesses etc to avoid frivolent claims and 2: to so many people, the cost of this insurance will be low, and available to all, payable either from personal funds or the specialist medical account

* Individuals are free to choose non-emergency treatment at whichever facility they desire, which adds contestability.

* Individuals choose whatever level of treatment and cover they wish, so make an economic and informed personal decision, rather than receiving a standardised service

That doesn't answer the question posed.

If the NHS is not the greatest thing that a government has ever done, what is?

Having some flaws (real and percieved), 60 years later, does not disqualify it from being a pretty monumental achievement.

the widening of the franchise to include all people over 21, regardless of gender or property rights perhaps?

The abolition of national Service?

the creation of a national road and rail network, allowing greater mobility of individuals and goods?

They shouldnt have to make an economic decision, Treatment should be based on their need, not on what they can afford!

NO! What you are suggesting does not give people the freedom of choice, it gives them the option of the lowest level of treatment availiable.

I guess you would consider such things as reatachment of lims etc frivolent claims...   we dont need a healthy work force who can function properly....

You are placing too much emphasis on economic decisions. This is a sick way of limiting peoples freedom, people can not make an informed decision if they have to spend thousands of pounds on treatment! Your whole idea is ridiculous, you say you want to give people choice, yet you are taking away their freedom to live.

People do not have a RIGHT to free medical treatment! this is the whole problem at the heart of this socialist system, the assumption that merely existing gives people all sorts of rights!

If you wanna tear it apart renal go for it, the above poster seems to have completely ignored my preference in the name of equality (much like socialism)

Representation of the People 1928? Maybe, was certainly a good thing, I'd argue that it was less significant because it was both preceded and succeeded by significant widening of the franchise in comparison to the nash which gave everyone healthcare in one fell swoop.

 
The abolition of national Service?
 

Potentially another good one, I'd argue against by questioning whether it was necessarily a good thing for the country (   ) and by pointing out that it only affected a single generation (after the end of WWII).

 
the creation of a national road and rail network, allowing greater mobility of individuals and goods?
 

Again a good one, but, to the best of my knowledge, not really the work of a single government.

Academically speaking, why is this necessarily so? People can have rights when they are given them, so, of all the rights that this country could grant it's subjects, why would medical treament free at the point of delivery not be one?

 
If you wanna tear it apart renal go for it,
 

I'd rather discuss it with you, if you don't mind.

I want to know whether people would have pay their NI contributions and insurance?
I want to know how you'd get the population to make informed choices about healthcare?
I want to know how you'd justify placing control over people's health in the hands of people who aren't medically trained and whose interests don't extend past the shareholders?

People have as many 'rights' as societies establish for them, and most recognise that it is in the wider interests of society (as well as, no doubt, their own interests) that everyone should have access to medical assistance when they are in need of it - regardless of their lack of personal ability to pay for it.

The same principle is applied to child education - most of us recognise that it is in the wider interests of society to give everyone access to basic education and likewise for medical care. Such provisions don't come about by accident, they come about because of a (sometimes stumbling) recognition that collective endeavour and redistribution sometimes just works better for most people.

I'd rather discuss it with you, if you don't mind.

I want to know whether people would have pay their NI contributions and insurance?

The contributions would be placed into an account so that they could be used to pay for insurance. therefore those making higher NI payments can use these to gain higher levels of coverage. this also allows this account to be topped up with personal funds.

I want to know how you'd get the population to make informed choices about healthcare?

This would of course be the main barrier to implimenting it properly, and why I fear this proposal can remain only hypothetical - as with many things the human element is an issue. This system would need to be implimented gradually, using a small test sample first. Before it could be implimented the populus would need to be educated on what they would need to do in order to gain the same level of cover as under the NHS, and how this would work.

I want to know how you'd justify placing control over people's health in the hands of people who aren't medically trained and whose interests don't extend past the shareholders?

The system would take it no more out of the hands of the medics than it already is. The cost and time constraints on medical staff is so great that mistakes are being made and patients are not getting the most appropriate treatment. The insurers would also need to be highly regulated so that decisions are not made on an ad hoc basis, but rather clearly laid out in the terms of the policy. The types of treatment would need to be classified into clear groups so that coverage is simple and easy to understand, and so that patients are not left recieving sub standard care.

 

Hope that is reasonably clear.

They will be left with substandard levels of care. once you force people to make a choice on what they can afford, it will always be the cheapest option. Not everyone has the luxury of being able to afford top notch care, therefore people suffer. It wont Work!
 
 
So it's better to give everone mediocre care, even if they can afford better, like the cancer patients who are given drugs which the NHS deems cost effective, even if they are not the best drugs, then refuse treatment if the patient purchases their own drugs?

Why do you want to punish people for being successful in life?

I dont, unless youve been living under a rock, then you will know that in Britain you do have access to private health care...

I think a better question would be why do you want to punish those who are not in the fortunate position to afford private health care?
 
 
then If I wish to select private healthcare, why would I continue to pay national insurance payments for a service I do not use?

I don't buy a bus pass when I want to drive my car, because I don't use the bus!

Why should I subsidise a service I don't use, and pay for other people's care??

Income taxation on higher incomes is fairly high, and subsidised medical care should come from that, not making me pay twice for something I don't use.

(when I say I it is hypothetically, as I don't have private medical care)

You could say that most public services were started by a single particular government administration in much the same way, though.

The official British military, for example, was first created way back in the early 1500s by Henry VIII. The UK Fire & Rescue Service has its routes in the 1938 Fire Services Act, pushed through by a single administration. The list goes on.

How is an individual with no health care training going to know the appropriate level of care? Do you suggest they google or listen to drug companies.

As an example if you get diagnosed with breast cancer, will you demand herceptin?

Well that is just errant nonsense. How could capitalism possibly lead to dole queues? Surely it should be "beggars starving in the gutter". You don't get that in North Korea, afterall - they can't afford gutters.

The war claim is also interesting. Let's examine the participants in the world wars:

World War One - Germany (absolute monarchy), Austro-Hungary (absolute monarchy), Russia (absolute monarchy), Ottoman Empire (absolute monarchy), Italy (monarchy), France (liberal capitalist), Britain (liberal capitalist), United States (liberal capitalist)

World War Two - Italy (fascist), Germany (national socialist), USSR ('socialism in one nation'), Japan (absolute monarchy), China (fascist/socialist components), Britain (liberal capitalist), France (liberal capitalist), America (liberal capitalist)

So we can see that in both instances liberal capitalist nations were in the minority, and, what's more, those that are are generally considered to have been in the right, and didn't start the wars.

---

The US healthcare system is really not a libertarian ideal. Provided legal protection from wronged customers, told what to include in insurance policies by state governments and separated from the consumer directly by tax incentives for mass-purchased company schemes (destroying competition, and liability to the individual rather than his employer for mistakes) have made a quasi-nationalised mess that only vaguely resembles a market healthcare system. Though, yes, it is better than Britain's healthcare system, unless you're the bottom ~5% of incomes (a lot of whom are immigrants, whose previous healthcare back home was even worse).

They're also the wars to which Orwell would have been referring. While I understand the Left is horrified by the deposition of the (socialistic) Ba'athist government in Iraq, this horror has not yet been able to project backwards in time to socialist thinkers who died decades before the war began. All that makes this a little strange:

He was attacking libertarianism, and none of these places were libertarian (note the label, 'liberal capitalist'). Whether or not they were also capitalist is an interesting question. Germany was certainly one of the most socialistic countries in Europe at the time:

"The German Empire also established, under Bismarck's direction, the social compact under which the German laboring classes supported the national ambitions of the newly united German state in exchange for a system of social welfare that would make them, if not full participants in the system, at least its beneficiaries in case of losing the ability to work by accident and pensioners. Bismarck was not a socialist, but he was convinced that it was necessary to accept portions of the socialist platform to sustain loyalty of the working classes, especially as the social progress was accompanied by banning the SPD."

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economi...ial_revolution 

Austria-Hungary was more bureaucratic than anything, though arguably too incompetent to be considered truly statist.

Italy had socialist governments even in the 19th century, and significant socialist influences throughout the period lasting to the present day.
 
 
As an historical phenomenon the rise of capitalism as the dominant mode of production has created unemployment on scales and intensities never before seen. As a process which has detached almost all people from any means of immediate production (for their own sustainence) capitalism has reduced populations to utter reliance on wage-labour and thus reliance on the successes and failures of industries and services which they labour for. It might be a push to say that there was no unemployment before capitalism but it's no push to say that, historically, we see scales and intensities of unemployment within capitalist organised labour systems far beyond any other mode.

yes it is Bizarre, and you completely misunderstood it.

This is how it is:

UK military: Food is (mostly) from the catering corps, usual army food loads of baked beans etc, but all for nutrition.

US military: Food is from Burger King, KFC whatever...

Its not about opening a branch in Iraq, its that service personal are fed junk food from a privately contracted company.

Ive said it before, the MIC is for the benefit of the companies, not the Individual Soldiers.

You might ask wtf this has to do with the NHS, but its comparable. You have a private company running a hospital, there is a conflict of interest between the Duty of Care owed to the Consumer (i.e. the patient) and the Duty owed to the Share holder. Therefore services will suffer as costs are reduced so that profit is maximised.

No, the US military has field rations as well (better ones than our army does), and the British soldiers can buy similar 'junk' from the NAAFI in their spare time. It's good for morale to be able to eat nice food for a change (or, at least, nice compared to a boil-in-a-bag mush); if you're trying to claim that the US military has replaced all rations in Iraq with Burger King then I'd like to see a source. Not that it would make much difference in terms of the capitalism debate, as the proper field rations are also manufactured by private companies.

I didn't say it wasn't. I said that an oligarchy of politically involved companies subsidised at the taxpayer's expense out of government largesse is not an element of a 'capitalist' system, but rather a state-corporatist/socialist one. What do you think went on in the USSR? There, the state directly owned monopoly defence manufacturers.

I don't understand how you're getting from the shareholders' rational wish to maximise their profits to the conclusion that the service will therefore be poor. Does this happen in any other industry? Food, for instance, is privately produced by farmers - are the most successful farmers those which produce low quality, diseased produce? By this standard, shouldnt we have expected to see the Reliant Robin or a 70s Skoda the most successful car in the world? Why do you suppose customers for healthcare would not hold suppliers to any reasonable standard of quality while being forced to admit that they clearly do so for far less important purchases, such as cars and televisions?

Supposing I were to take your odd Burger King argument at face value and not contradict any of the claims you have made, what has happened in that instance is that the government has introduced on the soldiers' behalf a monopoly provider which it protects from competition, and then forces the soldiers to buy from it. Does this sound more like a private, competitive market in healthcare, or more like the NHS?

I wasnt refering to rations, i was refering to on base canteen food. Also i guess you have never tried a US army MRE, but there is a reason why they are nicknamed Meals Rejected by Etheopians...

And again your making this stupid argument that free market capitalism leads to competition, it dosnt, it is an ABSOLUTE FACT that free market capitalism leads to monopolies. You can carry on with your libertarian drivel, but it is a FACT!

Theyre meant to be nutritional and easy to preserve for long periods, which aren't easy to combine with taste. I'm sure you're right when you say the one you tried was not very nice. Did you serve in the US army?

Sounds a lot like both, and neither. Healthcare isn't really comparable to a product like food.

In food you have a choice - you can eat well or you can eat badly, you can eat Japanese or you can eat French, and so on In medicine you don't have that choice. You either have the most appropriate treatment (regardless of whether it's the most expensive or the cheapest, the most cost efficient or the least, the newest or not, etc.) or you don't - simple really.

This is true for all products. The utilitarian benefit of a market is firstly that one can choose between several alternatives, so it is more likely that at least one will be more appropriate than that offered by a monopoly such as the NHS, and secondly that unsuccessful (inappropriate) options do not attract enough business to stay afloat and go bankrupt, so those options on offer are likely to be superior to those that would be presented by state subsidised competitors.

I think you're confusing popular with appropriate and are assuming that patients would be choosing their own treatments. Are you sure you're not applying whatever economic theory your using without consideration for the real world?

So you continue to claim. What you don't explain is why.
 
 
 
Originally Posted by Collingwood

Because it's not a product in the normal sense of the word - it's not something that 'customers' can become familiar with and have preferred brands. You can't have a 'favourite' antibiotic because that's not how medicine works in the real world.

Radiotherapy or chemotherapy for cancer? How would you like people to decide - which one has the best advertising? The only real example of free choice in healthcare is the alternative medicine market and that is a prime example of how these 'customers' can be mislead and dazzled by 'advertising' into making inappropriate decisions.

The other, far more serious, side to all this is that the companies and consortia who are taking on healthcare contracts in this country have already demonstrated that their interests are not with patients but are instead with profits. Look at Virgin who have been in the polyclinic business for a few months and are already accused of cutting medical provision and replacing it with less well qualified staff, circumventing patient confidentiality rules and cherry picking lucrative patients and leaving those who need the service to the NHS (you get a PBC budget based on your list, if you take a 10,000 patient list and remove a 5,000 who do not require medical treatment you will also remove the money that comes with that 5,000 which would be spent on providing treatment for those that do). Is that how you think healthcare should be provided? Is that how you'd like your family to be treated?

Oh ok, I understand your criticism now.

That isn't at all what I meant. I don't at all envisage a system under which someone who needs a heart bypass is asked to choose between having a heart bypass, a vascetomy or an MRI scan, or really people choosing to have any more direct involvement with their care than they do now. Rather, it would be treated like any other professional service in which there is competition. There is a free market in lawyers, for instance, but that obviously doesn't manifest itself as people instructing their lawyer to draw up a will in order to pursue a libel claim. Rather it manifests itself as people being able to choose whoever they have reason to believe will be the best lawyer to pursue their libel claim, and then following their advice, as in your example the system would manifest itself as the patient choosing whoever he believes to be the best cancer specialist. Now while you may counter that most patients know little about oncology, most people similarly know little about libel law, yet the most successful libel lawyers do indeed tend to be the best, and the same is true of all other professional services that exist in a free marketplace.

 
The other, far more serious, side to all this is that the companies and consortia who are taking on healthcare contracts in this country have already demonstrated that their interests are not with patients but are instead with profits.

Etc.
 

What do you expect to happen when the government hands out what are effectively licenced monopolies to private companies that receive their payment from the government rather than the patients concerned, or their insurers? That isn't a free market system.

It's a ****ing disgrace is what it is, but how else are a government going to split up the nash? Look at the rail franchises?

Either, the NHS will be physically demolished and the consortia will have to build their hospitals from scratch or existing NHS trusts will be sold 'as is'. The latter creates monopolies for two reasons, the first is that patients have shown time and again that they don't actually want choice (being offered the choice of three hospitals for a treatment almost all of them (except middle class women   ) choose their local DGH), the second is that these sold off hospital trusts will be large and well equipped (because they are now) which would make it very hard for a potential competitor to set up in business down the road.
 
 
I agree it's a disgrace; it's also not a free market system. Neither is the government's handing out of temporary monopoly franchises in railways.

Why do hospitals even need to be sold? Turn each hospital into a charitable trust if you like. The important thing is for the funding for healthcare to come from the patients. Even if you are socialistic and think healthcare should be funded for the poor by redistribution, it's still better to simply pay the poor to buy health insurance in a private system than to keep the present one.

A lot of your opposition to this seems to be based on strawman attacks of Blair's choice agenda. I do not support New Labour's nonsense. Being able to choose between 3 hospitals run and owned by the same state subsidised monopoly is like being given the 'choice' between three identical British Leylands, and no one would confuse the latter with a free market in cars.

You're either an idiot, intellectually dishonest, or both. Did you even bother to read the article you linked to? Because that hospital is actually a public one.

There's a strange misconception on here that the US healthcare system is actually a private system. Nothing could be further from the truth - as a matter of fact, the US government spends more per capita on healthcare per citizen than the UK does! Check  here  for yourself if you don't believe me.

Now if anyone actually wants to have a decent debate about the NHS, without the polemical and factually incorrect nonsense that is so prevalent, I'd be more than happy to get involved.

That's not actually a bad idea, but, what would really be different from the NHS? I suspect that you'll lead on to say that standards will improve as they compete against each other but that ignores the points that most people will always go to their local and that many local hospitals need to be kept open to provide acute care services.

 
Even if you are socialistic and think healthcare should be funded for the poor by redistribution, it's still better to simply pay the poor to buy health insurance in a private system than to keep the present one.
 

Why? Do you believe that private healthcare will be more generous? Do you believe that they'll give herceptin and the rest out like smarties? Do you believe that they'd support chronically ill patients better than the NHS? As far as my prejudices against the private sector go, the only people who will benefit from compulsory health insurance are those least likely to need it.

You're familiar with the concept of performance tables, etc. in health 'competition'?

Add in the spin, the manipulation and the deceit, do you think any of us would?

I'd just like to add that it is in in the interests of hospitals to to setup independent (or non-independent) commissions to check the accuracy of data and to present it in the public in an easier format - as it is with the watch and jewelry (and i'm sure others too) industries presently.

I'm not familiar with the jewelary industry, I am however familiar with the mortality figures which punish centres and surgeons who do difficult cases and reward those (like ISTCs) who cherry pick the easy, unlikely to **** up, cases.

Actually... shareholders are there to make as much profit as possible and that is their only interest in the business, and they will appoint the management as such. Farmers on the other hand care more about making enough money to get by than amassing great profits (nobody goes into farming to get rich) and are also going to have a great deal of pride in their product which encourages them to care for their animals well to produce a high-quality product. If you look at, say, battery farming, where the incentive to introduce it is to make more profit (lower running costs due to less labour etc) then the quality gets much worse due to cutting corners to save money. If you think this is getting a bit silly, then fine, you were the one who compared farming to healthcare...

I'm also a bit confused by these systems where you must have at least a minimum level of healthcare. Surely those in hospital with a "major illness" or after a big accident are the ones using most resources as they're the ones undergoing expensive procedures and using expensive drugs - and they have to as their life depends on it. In fact I'd be surprised if things that aren't life threatening used that much NHS resources at all overall as people tend to be in hospital because they need to be. So I don't see any reason why cutting down the amount everybody gets as standard would improve anything, as it probably wouldn't save that much money...

Most people go to their local supermarket as well, yet competition seems to work in the supermarket industry, to the extent that the ever-meddling government thinks supermarkets are selling things they disapprove of too cheaply. This wasn't the case in the Warsaw Pact, where supermarkets, where they existed at all, were nationalised monopolies. People only prefer locality when the improvement in quality gained by travelling further afield is minimal, as it is in the present NHS (most people live in cities where multiple hospitals are 'local' in the sense of being practically reachable, afterall), and as it is in the supermarket industry.

In a private system there is significantly greater incentive to improve service, and anyone is able to enter the market to try, rather than just the government and a handful of marginalised BUPA hospitals that cater for the very rich. There's no reason why, in such a system, people would refuse to go to better hospitals that are further away than they would refuse to travel for any product or service they buy. Personally I would think they have greater incentive when it concerns their health rather something less vital.

 
Why? Do you believe that private healthcare will be more generous? Do you believe that they'll give herceptin and the rest out like smarties? Do you believe that they'd support chronically ill patients better than the NHS? As far as my prejudices against the private sector go, the only people who will benefit from compulsory health insurance are those least likely to need it.
 

It's nothing to do with generosity or compulsion. "It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest." The private system would be superior, so it is preferable to seperate the redistribution of money from the rich to the poor from the nationalisation of the services purchased with that money, which is not at all necessary to achieve the former objective.

 
Isn't it essentially the same thing? I agree that supposed 'choice' is not available now, but even if it were I doubt it would make any difference to the average member of the public. (Except as far as meaningless statistics can be twisted).

You're familiar with the concept of performance tables, etc. in health 'competition'? Do you think most members of the public would be able to understand such complicated, multi-factorial data as morbidity and mortality rates if it was presented openly, honestly and not with an advertisers spin? Add in the spin, the manipulation and the deceit, do you think any of us would?
 

Why do you continue to assume that I, as a libertarian capitalist, want to emulate a state-run and owned system of giving taxpayer largesse to favoured special interest businesses to provide services according to targets, league tables, 5 year plans &c. administered by a 'labour party' that produces its own statistics to try to justify policies that it needs to justify in order to survive?

Hospitals are hardly complicated compared to other things that people already buy with quite adequate information - computers and legal services spring to mind. Even take something fairly simple like plumbers - do people actually understand how their house's plumbing works? Do they choose plumbers on the basis of reams of statistics on what % of pipes installed fail after 5 years or the corrosion rates of various metals used? Of course not. But people are still able to select plumbers on the basis of the quality of service other people have received, or they have received in the past. As information about healthcare is clearly more valuable than information about plumbers, or even, say, hotels, why do you assume that consumer information won't be produced on a for-profit basis such as the AA Hotel Guide, which is generally accepted to be independent and accurate?

Are you saying farmers could 'amass great profits,' but choose not to because 'they have a good deal of pride in their product' and 'just want enough to get by'? If so, that is fairly obviously nonsense. If not, this line of argument proves nothing at all - farmers are still trying to make as much money as possible, but are failing to make as much as (you claim) shareholders in large companies make, as their trade is not particularly profitable.

I think rationality is taking a back seat to sentimentality here.

Take, for instance, supermarkets. They are 'large corporations' with 'greedy shareholders' - do they stock 'poor quality and diseased produce'? It would be cheaper to do so, afterall. But in fact one of the complaints of farmers in this country is that supermarkets reject a lot of their products due to strict standards even on things the farmers think are unimportant, such as colour, size and shape.

Battery farming is also not intended to compete with organic and free range foods. Those are luxury products that the bulk of the populace either cannot afford or would rather spend the money on other things. Nor is battery farming produce 'low quality' or 'diseased' - it is simply lower quality than luxury foods.

 
I'm also a bit confused by these systems where you must have at least a minimum level of healthcare.

No idea. I don't think I advocated that sort of system anywhere on this thread, so you should probably ask someone else.

Supermarkets are interested in profit not welfare and only have incentive to address food standards if forced to by regulation or if significant consumer awareness (not something the supermarkets are too keen on of course) and action affects profit. The flaws in leaving food standards to the supermarkets is easily revealed in the taste of your average supermarket tomato; they pretty much taste of nothing and are grown for colour, shape, bulk and to be 'blemish' free, not for their nutritional or taste value. Many people, especially in the city, may not realise how good a home-grown or allotment tomato is and how absultely rubbish supermarket produce can be because the motives which determine the method of production and supply is only profit.
 
 
I wasn't aware that capitalism was exploitative and alienating before your post Oswy, but now that I realise the pernicious influence it has in stopping me from eating green, weirdly shaped tomatoes I'm convinced. Odd tasting tomato lovers of the world, unite!
 
 
i try to use the co-op supermarket as much as possible.... Its local and has all the essentials.

I think it would definatly be a good thing if more Supermarkets were run as co-operatives...
 
 
I think free heath care is something that we (luckily) take for granted, and when we take something for granted we seem to forget how precious it is.

I read an article a while back (can't remember the details) in which the author suggested an escalating fuel (and thus food) crisis would bring about a localisation of food production and distribution (a kind of modern incarnation of the market-garden system which provided London prior to the technological revolution which allowed globalised food transportation). Once a year I get a bag of allotment tomatoes from a relative who grows them for pleasure and doesn't eat them - they're fantastic - I'd never normally contemplate eating a tomato on its own (such is the blandness of what you get at a supermarket) but these are so full of flavour that all they need is to be cut in half and sprinkled with a little pepper. Sure, they come in odd colours and shapes and they have 'blemishes', but they are unmistakably superior as an eating experience and, I'll wager, nutritionally superior too.

If you want to apply the analogy to healthcare - you can have a supermarket hernia repair provided you have the right size hernia in the right place, you need a more difficult job, you'll need to look elsewhere.

This is not a particularly good criticism. The market does, afterall, provide specialist shops for people who have odd tastes in vegetables. It just doesn't enforce these uncommon requirements on everyone, and nor should a good healthcare system centre all treatment on the very hardest cases (for instance by insisting on stringent educational and licensing standards that are often unnecessary, but increase the price and so reduce the supply of healthcare).

Neither does the NHS, but the NHS trains people to do both.

It should, and it does. How do you suppose that an surgeon becomes good at doing the difficult operations? By only doing difficult operations? And anyway, how are private hospitals going to be able to afford to do the longer and more complicated operations when they cost more and there's greater risk?

Indeed, but we don't need privitisation to see doctors replaced with 'health care professionals' and protocols.

You start off attacking a condemnation of "unnecessary" standards, then end by attacking the idea that people shouldnt have a "required" standard. Of course they should have a "required" standard - that is simply a tautology. The question is what is the "required" standard? Do you simply believe that no level of education is unnecessary? If so, why not agitate to have doctors study at university for twenty or thirty years rather than just six? The present cut-off point is simply arbitrary, and there are many things present GPs do not know. But we have no way of knowing whether or not the present standard is that which people in practice would find the optimal balance (if, indeed, a uniform optimal in everyones' view exists) between expense in opportunity cost (time spend learning rather than working) and scarcity cost (not as many people will undergo a long, extensive training programme than a shorter one, particularly if they accrue debts while doing so) as against quality of service and versatility (they can always refer unusual cases to specialists, afterall), because the powerful monopoly doctor's union imposes this same arbitrary standard on everyone.

You can't talk about a shortage in doctors and the expense of private healthcare if you are not willing to discuss what is keeping the cost so high.

Why does every surgeon need to be able to do the hardest operations at all? As these, like the desire for oddly shaped vegetables, will be the least common, a small number of people could simply specialise in these operations, and in doing so be better at them than a system in which a large number of surgeons do them only sporadically amidst much easier cases.

 
And anyway, how are private hospitals going to be able to afford to do the longer and more complicated operations when they cost more and there's greater risk?
 

Amazingly, it is possible for a service provider to charge different prices for different services.

Well again, I don't really like Blair's agenda and what has gone along with it, and I appreciate fully your antipathy toward it. It is not a free market system, it is a state-corporatist system. At least under socialism the intentions were often pure; this sort of thing is just snouts-in-the-trough taxpayer largesse to licenced monopolies, providing the worst of both worlds. My objective is really not to infuse hospitals with meaningless middle management jargon and regulate everything up to the hilt - quite the opposite, I want to see the system freed to try different approaches, and see what works best.

I don't think you understand what he's saying at all. He's saying that having surgeons who are able to perform all (including the hardest) cases may not be a particularly efficient way of doing things. I don't see how the specialist medical knowledge which you seem to claim helps you see this; it's really an economic question. The argument, of course, is that since some doctors are better than others, it would make sense for the best to do the hardest cases and the worst to only focus on the easier cases. At any rate, I think that under a free market, even one with state provided health care insurance vouchers, would look completely different to the way it does now. I have a sneaking suspicion that doctors would be quite a bit worse off (since Bevan 'stuffed their mouths with gold' in the creation of the NHS, their interests have been strongly aligned with it) under another system, which might go some way to explaining the level of hostility.

I know that's what he's saying and I agree that it's not efficient, however, it is the only way that would be acceptable that those surgeons who are able to perform the hardest cases achieve and maintain competency between those hardest cases. It would also be difficult to maintain on-call rotas if certain surgeons were not able to do them because they were 'too good'.

 
I don't see how the specialist medical knowledge which you seem to claim helps you see this; it's really an economic question.
 

Well, of course it is economic. But economics doesn't exist in a vacuum, the implications of whatever economic theory you believe in will have an impact on the lives and health of real people. How can you decree that there's no need for all surgeons to do all operations when this is already true and well recognised and practiced.

Seeing a GP privately gives the practice ~£65, seeing on the NHS gives the practice £8, which do you suppose doctors would prefer? In fact, since doctors are a relative scarcity there's certainly potential for doctors conditions to improve as private companies compete for them.

Don't get me wrong, I'm certainly not saying that I know enough about the organisation of medical provision that I'd be able to come up with the most efficient way myself. All I'm making is the more general claim that the best way to organise things would be to let the market decide, because this is the only structure which has incentives aligned in such a way that an efficient distribution is the most likely outcome. I don't know personally what the best way of allocating surgeons is, but given that there are very few market failures and collective action problems with healthcare (contagious diseases are the only one off the top of my head) I see no reason to suppose that the market will work significantly differently to other industries.

I don't see what medical knowledge has to do with it. As DH says, it's an economic question. At worst, the system I am describing as preferable would produce the same outcome as the present one has already (though I don't think it will). It may be possible that that doctors' training under the private system, which you admit would be more efficient, may be exactly the same, but we have no way of knowing, precisely because of the enforced homogeneity of the present system.

 
Explain how.
 

Something cannot at once be better than is required and perfectly tailored to the requirement. While it may seem that being better in this instance is no disutility, merely irrelevent, because being better is more expensive to acquire than being merely adequate it increases the price of the product/service for no increased utility.

 
Until it's priced out of the market?
 

It would only be priced out of the market if someone else was offering the same service to the same standard for less money, which seems ideal to me.

 
And I agree, but how would you avoid it while a transition to private system occured?
 

To be clear, I do not believe that Blair's agenda is a transition to a market in healthcare or actually anything to do with free markets or liberalism at all.

As I envision it, we could simply turn over each hospital to the ownership of a private trust and abolish the government subsidy to each, along with its regulations.

 
Which is all well and good, but I have serious reservations about providing a decent standard of care to the public while doing it.
 

Well, to give an example, as I'm not entirely sure you understand what I mean, it would be perfectly appropriate to go to an unknown firm of solicitors and consult someone on £20k-£30k/year in order to do something fairly simple, like draw up a will. Meanwhile it would also be appropriate to go to a top-name barrister who charges £100s/hour if you were indicted in a serious fraud case. Now while you would probably also get a better service on your will by going to the top-name barrister for that as well, the improvement would be so minor that it is not worth the enormous additional charge. Worse, there is only a limited supply of top-name barristers - if we tried to mandate a system in which every lawyer was trained to an identical standard, and then banned 'discrimination' in pay between lawyers on the basis of aptitude, we would be faced with a system where you have to pay £100s/hour for even simple legal services, and the quality of your service would be mostly random. This sounds a lot to me like a system in which a country GP is paid >£100,000.

I am not saying that I want to fill the healthcare system with cowboys and barely-trained temps - people would no more pay for that than they would for a person off the street to draw up their will for them - but I do want a system in which people can decide for themselves what they are willing to pay for in different circumstances, just as they are able to decide, for instance, what level of protection they are willing to pay for when buying a car. This is not only the most just system, but also, as DH says, the system most likely to result in the most efficient practically possible outcome. Far be it from me, or any one individual, so say exactly how the healthcare system should be organised, I would prefer an approach where such top-down planning does not happen at all - a free system.

Absolutely; you're right. The thing is that once we realise that there is the possibility of improvement in efficiency, we can balance it with the other things that are important. For instance, given that we accept a free market provides the best incentive structure for reducing waste and reaching a more or less efficient use of resources, we can think of ways to get closer too it. If you think the goal includes universal healthcare, why not a voucher system, for example: why don't we agree on a basic, minimum standard of acceptable healthcare, and give everybody a voucher for this amount which they can only spend on healthcare? The mere introduction of competition for these vouchers will mean that people get a lot better of a deal. Will there be a two tier system? Maybe, but even the worst off will have a better standard of care, so I don't see any coherent way to argue that this is bad. But just thinking of alternatives gets us out of the narrow way of thinking 'only a centralised, government run, free at the point of use system is absolutely best.'

What other goal do you have in mind, and why would it be better served by an NHS system? As the economic service provided is healthcare, and so most efficiently providing it results in the best healthcare at the lowest price as demanded by the customer, this should surely be all that does matter.

EDIT: I notice DH is talking about vouchers, &c. - I am only referring here to how the healthcare system itself would work, not how it would be paid for. Whether or not people should be given funds, in whatever form, by the government in order to pay for more than they could otherwise afford is a different issue entirely.

 
It cannot exist in a vacuum. You cannot magically train specialist surgeons who will only work as and when required for specific cases, especially if those are not common.
 

Well yes you can select and train specialist surgeons, just as specialists are generated in any other field. I realise that there may not always be demand for very specialist skills and so there may be free slots where these people may as well take cases for which they're overqualified, but in large hospitals this not likely to be common.

Anyway, I think the discussion of this topic has strayed a little too far. As you've pointed out, I cannot really argue with you about the minutae of how the NHS is arranged - my comments on this matter are only based on what you have told me, specifically that "a good healthcare system should and does centre all treatment on the very hardest cases". If this is the case, then it is clearly more wasteful than a system of specialists. If not, then the NHS and the private system are only in agreement - that isnt an argument against the private system.

 
I disagree, I think that rare, very specialised or very dangerous treatments would be very hard for a private company to offer and very hard for an insurance company (or individual) to pay for.
 

In the US, insurance is either in the millions of dollars, or totally unlimited.

 
Which regulations?
 

The NHS is centrally directed by a govt department, so most of its top level management is 'regulation' in that sense.

 
What if you didn't know that drawing up a will was a simple procedure?
 

Then you would consult another legal professional for a referral. I'm sure you can easily draw a parrallel.

It's an illustrative example. Consultants within individual specialisms are similarly trained. Clearly doctors in different specialisms are differently trained, but they also do different jobs in the sense that if you needed a heart bypass, an oncologist would not be much use. As I've said before, I am not proposing a blue-print to remould the country's healthcare system personally - I have no idea or much interest in the precise minutae of how the market system would be arranged - but there are very good reasons to believe it would be superior.

As the economic service provided is healthcare, and so most efficiently providing it results in the best healthcare at the lowest price as demanded by the customer, this should surely be all that does matter.
 

I don't believe that in a number of key ways, it's incompatible. Should patients stay in hospital for the shortest (and cheapest possible time), as long as they want, the time their insurance company wants or the time the hospital administrator what?

 
Well yes you can select and train specialist surgeons, just as specialists are generated in any other field. I realise that there may not always be demand for very specialist skills and so there may be free slots where these people may as well take cases for which they're overqualified, but in large hospitals this not likely to be common.
 

How are you going to change a hospital's caseload? Particularly if you decentralise the 'market'?

Anyway, I think the discussion of this topic has strayed a little too far. As you've pointed out, I cannot really argue with you about the minutae of how the NHS is arranged - my comments on this matter are only based on what you have told me, specifically that "a good healthcare system should and does centre all treatment on the very hardest cases". If this is the case, then it is clearly more wasteful than a system of specialists. If not, then the NHS and the private system are only in agreement - that isnt an argument against the private system.

 
In the US, insurance is either in the millions of dollars, or totally unlimited.
 

All of it? Even those that can't get insurance?   I thought we weren't duscussing the US cos it's crap  , but I'd be interested to know how France manages that.

 
The NHS is centrally directed by a govt department, so most of its top level management is 'regulation' in that sense.
 

Only complicated by payment by results, payment by improvement, payment by work or whatever system they're using this week to reward and punish the trusts. Thing is though, you wouldn't need to privitise the nash to get rid of that.

[quote]It's an illustrative example. Consultants within individual specialisms are similarly trained. Clearly doctors in different specialisms are differently trained, but they also do different jobs in the sense that if you needed a heart bypass, an oncologist would not be much use.[/qute]If you needed a heart bypass, you might have to choose between a cardiothoracic consultant or his registrar at 2/3 the price?

 
As I've said before, I am not proposing a blue-print to remould the country's healthcare system personally - I have no idea or much interest in the precise minutae of how the market system would be arranged - but there are very good reasons to believe it would be superior.
 

Absolutely, and there are equally good reasons, based on the experience of other privatisations in this country, that it wouldn't. All a bit intractable really.

That's a very good way of putting it.

 
If you think the goal includes universal healthcare, why not a voucher system, for example: why don't we agree on a basic, minimum standard of acceptable healthcare, and give everybody a voucher for this amount which they can only spend on healthcare?
 

It's a good idea, but the only problem I see is that such a voucher would be worth a really top-notch nose job or dialysis for three months. What happens in chronic conditions where the cost of that minimum-standard is limited only by the life-expectancy of the patient?

 
But just thinking of alternatives gets us out of the narrow way of thinking 'only a centralised, government run, free at the point of use system is absolutely best.'
 

I certainly wouldn't argue that, but I would urge caution and be very dubious of the interests of the private sector.
 
 
I am a cancer survivor and have yearly checkups to make sure there is no relapse. One day in the hospital with MRIs, Cat scans, all that jazz generally sets me back $7,000. I no longer have insurance and thus have been without a checkup since I got the same tests in China (and then mailed them to my doctor back home) for about 400 dollars.

If you are going to compare systems then I think you should also include affordability and accessibility because even when I had health insurance it did little good as anything cancer related was a 'pre-existing condition'.

That's a very good point about private health insurance. Imperfect as it may be, the NHS aims to provide treatment on the basis of your actual needs. Private health insurance, in order to maximise its profitability, does its best to find small-print which exempts it from paying out or paying out as little as possible and in any event assists you only as far as the level of premium you can afford.

It seems a little harsh to say it's fine that survival rates are almost half, because it is less inconvenient to policy holders.

I'm not justifying it, but it does depend very much on what you're measuring, what's killing them, whether they're reporting for treatment, millions of small variables.

Despite my previous comments I never forget that had I not been born in the US, I might not be around today to give it such a hard time. That being said, something has to be done- this massive problem has gone on far too long and I know too many people in a similar situation.

So let's see, the US spends twice as much on healthcare, and Americans have by far the highest survival rates of cancer, while Britain has one of the worst rates in Western Europe (which might have improved somewhat in the last decade, but that's because the government has shifted funding from other diseases to cancer). So even though 14% of Americans aren't covered by healthcare insurance, only 8% die from prostate cancer. All Brits are covered, and yet 49% die from it. It's amazing how brainwashed people can be about a failing system.

 

So..... because one system spends almost double the amount on healthcare and it shows improvements in two particular diseases with thousands of confounding factors involved means it's better?

Indeed, an 18-year-old figure of dubious origin just seems that it exists purely because of the wait and not a lack of drugs or surgeons or beds or screening or any of the other factors that might be important. Self-important rhetoric then.

 
It's not two particular diseases. The US has the highest survival rate in the world for most life-threatening illnesses. The UK is near the bottom of the list (from first world countries) in most of them.
 

Sauce? Or just more made-up rhetoric?

Of course it does; the beauty of opening the market up to competition is that companies that do this to a large extent will not survive. But you, of course, neglect to mention that the NHS does the same: try and tell  Linda O'Boyle  that the NHS won't try to find small print to exempt it from paying out. Oh wait, that's right, you can't - your fabulous NHS killed her.

Similarily, I believe state hospitals cannot refuse anyone treatment in the case of an emergency. This is essentially a saftey net that is intended to ensure that those who are unable to meet the cost of their care are covered, while the system also encourages those on higher incomes be more personally responsible by seeking insurance, which will also ensure they recieve high quality care.

Many of the problems with the American health care system come from the practices of the insurance companies. There is certainly a need for reform of the insurance system, although countries like Singapore show that insurance systems can work very well. In Singapore they operate compulsary medical savings schemes that provide insurance for individuals and this has helped to create one of the efficient healthcare systems in the world, which maintains a high quality of care, especially when compared to it's neighbouring countries.

 

Wow, I'm impressed. You understand the American system better than some Americans do.

The state funded insurance is actually quite good, but for some reason a third of people who qualify for the coverage never bother to enroll. We need to get people better educated on what services are available to them.

I think I could just about agree with that; and I still don't care that it was stopped.

Seriously, what the hell? My primary school had paid-for milk; it was about 20p per day, or £30 per year. I understand a lot of people hate Thatcher, but does it really make any rational sense to hate her because she cut a £30 subsidy, which wasn't even targeted at the poor? I wouldn't mind so much if this milk thing didn't come up at every mention of her name.
 
 
I just like me milk damnit!

Actually rather than me explaining it, just go watch sicko, if you want US style health care here (and it would be US style thanks to our special relationship), then thats what you will get.

Erm... this kind of thing happens in the US as well. Liver tranplants are a scarce resource regardless of where you are and they are prioritised for those with proven ability to stay sober and not **** up the new liver. As expected, the article doesn't talk about the young girl (for example) who received a liver that would have otherwise gone to this gentleman.
 
 
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that liver transplants are regulated and doled out based on percentage survivability pretty much everywhere...

Is that right? The problem with your example is that you've chosen a "bad vs good" scenario, whereas, as we know; it might easily be
Good vs Good
Bad vs Bad
Good vs Bad
Bad vs Good
(I realise that might sound patronising. It wasn't intended to be.)

Where the former receives the liver and the latter doesn't. The point is that profit is the least arbitrary method of deciding who is good and who isn't. Why do bureaucrats get to decide who is bad and who is good, i.e. who deserves a liver treatment and who doesn't? The decision has to be made in terms of allocation of scarce resources, but I don't see why the arbitrary decisions of bureaucrats ought to trump profit. The market, after all, is generally blind.

Pretty much everywhere is, well, nationalised   I mean, how many countries would you say have a free market healthcare system? Two, three, maybe? (USA, Singapore, Hong Kong, I'm only guessing your opinion though) certainly I would say none. IMO the way the rest of the world does it shouldn't come into it unless we're looking at quantifiable statistics.

That's almost certainly not the case in this instance. A, who drinks has X% chance of rejecting the liver. B, who doesn't drink has Y% chance of rejecting the liver. X>Y. The liver should therefore go to B.

Well, the point was merely to disprove the idea that there was a widely accepted alternative to the way the NHS runs organ transplants.
 
 
I'm just going to dump my opinion on the NHS here... this will probably be lengthy so I don't mind if it's ignored, but feel free to attack it.

I am almost unequivocally in favour of private provision as a more abstract theory, but looking at the NHS in particular provides some problems. When the state takes control of a sector of the economy for any long amount of time, the amount of centralisation and monopolisation that occurs tends to make efforts to privatise them, well, failures, or perhaps not failures, but it creates some certain structural problems to do with competition that don't ever seem to go away. Look at QUANGOs for instance -- they are, to the mind of many people, total waste of money. They don't really do much for the public that wouldn't have been done in a market environment anyway, but cost enormous amounts of money (£100bn +). The problem is they employ more than a million people... getting rid of them is therefore problematic.

The NHS suffers from the same problem. I haven't yet seen any publication that provides a sound plan for NHS privatisation, and I don't think a Thatcherite approach would work. On the small scale of individual doctors and dentists I don't think there's a problem, but saddling people with a healthcare system that is private at the bottom but public at the top seems to me like not particularly a great idea in terms of cost. I mean, it might work, but as I said I've not seen any detailed plans for this -- if anyone has any, let me know.

On the other hand, I don't like the idea of being stuck with a system that keeps getting more expensive, and, it seems, worse.

In my opinion, we should seek out a healthcare system that provides affordable health care to the majority of the population. If that eventually turns out to be single payer, I would, somewhat grudgingly, accept that, but single-payer systems have all the problems of any state industry: the calculation problem, for instance. I also have a suspicion that the NHS, as a bastion of the Left, is being used to further Leftist control goals. Whether you think Fascism and Socialism are the same thing or not is not for this thread, but in the area of healthcare, Health Fascism -- or, at the very least, Health Authoritarianism. For instance, the Obama Presidency has plans to force people to collect health insurance... or be fined. Heavily.

I'm sure you all know what I mean, though. Under the guise of Public Health, the NHS has gone on a campaign of changing people's behaviour, ultimately, by force and coercion and even when this doesn't work, public propaganda with the intent of ostracising the people they target and making them victims of ridicule. Heavy drinkers and fat people, for instance, must surely feel that they are being targeted. I know as a smoker that I am. A private health system wouldn't do this: it would just place higher costs upon them or end up, eventually, denying them care.

Another issue is that Healthcare scandals become more politicised than they might otherwise be. MRSA, for instance. I mean, although the Government is in charge of Healthcare, cleanliness in hospitals isn't really a Central Government issue. It's the fault of the management of that particular hospital. In a private environment, these issues are simply matters of competition -- "people have died in that hospital due to lack of hygiene" no longer becomes a reason for political discourse. I don't know of any bureaucrats who've lost their jobs over hospital failings, although there probably are in fairness. The less politicisation the better, in my opinion... politicians and bureaucrats alike have an awful, and generally intrinsic tendency to **** things up.

More generally, the ability of an industry to perform is directly related to the amount of capital in that industry. One reason why the US healthcare market began to fail is simply that conditions for capital accumulation in the United States began to decline. This is associated in this country with a generally distrust of the idea that profit should be linked to healthcare. But profit is always used to re-invest to create more profit. The "investment" that people demand in the NHS, in a purely free market scenario, (at least once we're out of this recession... if ever) would be plentiful. Investment means more beds, more doctors, more specialists, more equipment... more livers, even. There is a lack of capital in British hospitals. Why? Because states can't be trusted to properly calculate the required type and amount of capital to be invested over a period of time.

And if they can't be trusted to properly calculate that, considering what capital is, I don't think they can be properly trusted to do very much at all.

Perhaps in this particular instance there are quantifiable specifics that allow us to make a better judgement (although we may always consider the margin; X and Y may be very close and the personalities of A and B may not be close at all; for instance, a released murderer with only 1% chance more of accepting the liver compared to an absolute saint who has donated their entire life to helping charity... but yes, I see your point) but healthcare is a scarce resource. There are countless things that must be distributed and therefore are open to arbitrary judgement, which many people advocate.

I was referring to someone else getting a liver because they deserve it medically. A young, healthy non-drinker (which is what I was referring to when I referred to a young girl - I hoped the 'for example' gave that away) gains more benefit and chance of satisfactory long-term outcome.

With regards to the bit in bold, the market is blind and also uncaring. Personally I think a system whereby liver transplants went to who could pay the most is an entirely unsatisfactory way of organising liver transplants.

The latter two are largely non-private healthcare systems.

The western world historically has a trend of moving from private healthcare to more 'socialised' healthcare, largely because it works better in terms of providing healthcare to a population. If you look at most third world countries, they certainly still use private health care to varying degrees.

I certainly didn't advocate any any arbitary judgements. If I did use appeal to emotion, it was only to counter the obvious appeal to emotion by the OP with his article.
