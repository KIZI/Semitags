The FA Cup second-round draw has thrown up a potential meeting between MK Dons and AFC Wimbledon, the breakaway team formed after the original Wimbledon was allowed to relocate to Milton Keynes.

Both sides must first contest first-round replays, with AFC facing Ebbsfleet and MK Dons taking on Stevenage.

AFC Wimbledon was established in 2002 when 1988 FA Cup winner Wimbledon Football Club -- nicknamed the Dons -- was allowed to move 50 miles (80 kilometers) north from its original base and change names.

AFC would have home advantage for a meeting with MK Dons at its Kingsmeadow ground later this month.

But AFC hopes the situation doesn't transpire, saying in a statement that it would be a "very painful" match.
