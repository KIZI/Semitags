 
 
A Nobel Peace Prize for Julian Assange?
 
 
DISCLAIMER: I am not--repeat NOT--offering a personal opinion on Julian Assange here though I do have a personal opinion about all that which I will probably share later.

But I will admit that this Paul Wachter piece did make me back up and rethink some of my opinion about all that:

 
Dec. 10) -- "[T]he Nobel Committee has chosen someone who has been an eloquent and courageous spokesman for the advance of universal values through peaceful and nonviolent means, including his support for democracy, human rights and the rule of law." -- statement by President Barack Obama on the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo.

There is now another imprisoned "courageous spokesman for the advance of universal values through peaceful and nonviolent means" whom the Nobel Committee should be considering for next year's award: Julian Assange.

Through a series of leaks -- first of military documents concerning the United States' ongoing and doomed efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq; now of cables unveiling a hodgepodge of diplomatic duplicities -- Assange's organization, WikiLeaks, has offered up an unflattering portrayal of U.S. foreign policy.

It's the first real stab at a correction of the crusading, lawless Bush years that President Obama, the impulsive Nobel Committee's designee two years ago, has perpetuated.

The recent diplomatic leaks -- a mere 960 or so so far, all first published by the world's most prestigious newspapers -- have revealed, among many other outrages:
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's illegal (under the U.S.-signed 1961 Vienna Treaty) ordering of her diplomatic employees to spy on United Nations personnel.

A U.S. policy that precludes U.S. personnel in Iraq from investigating atrocities committed against civilians.

Saudi Arabia is still the major funder of al-Qaida and an advocate for an "Arab army" to confront Hezbollah in Lebanon.

But rather than calling for congressional investigations, American politicians and a largely sycophantic press have targeted the messenger.

Sarah Palin's recent tweets implicitly call for Assange's assassination. Without any evidence, Jeffrey Kuhner of the right-wing Washington Times writes that the leaks could lead to many Americans and their allies "being killed, tortured or targeted by insurgents." And that's also the White House line. (Also note that the administration is showing much more resolve going after Assange than Osama bin Laden, who killed 3,000 Americans and is probably, at this moment, happily sipping a cup of tea.)...

So what do you think? Is Assange a villain who is attempting to undermine the security and integrity of the USA? Or is he a hero and a wakeup call for indefensible corruption in government that nobody has the courage to address?

Did the quoted piece make any difference in how you look at this? Or do you see Wachter as being over the top and indefensible in his point of view?
 
 
He's some of both and more.

Compared to the government he's a virtual saint, should be canonized. His leaks regarding war may well be worthy of a peace prize Obama never earned but still received. There is clearly a danger in disclosing sensitive information, but it's pretty mild danger in context. Esp since we have maintained arsenals capable of even accidentally destroying much of the world for decades. Esp considering our nearly constant wars.

But mostly the hypocrisy and danger posed by a government that spys on absolutely everybody but demands secrecy of it's own affairs, affairs that in most cases we have a need to know more about......well that's where assange looks downright saintly in contrast.

But in real life he probably has a few screws loose and a tendency toward sensationalism and gratuitous risk. He may also have an ego disorder. So typical of public figures anymore.

Does it matter if he is a self serving idealist if he does end up promoting a good outcome? Should we blame him if the response to his leaks dampens civil liberties forever?

Both interesting questions.

Do you convict Robinhood for theft if he intends only to do good for others with the money? Does a good motive for committing a crime absolve the person of the consequences for the crime itself? How long could we maintain a law abiding and orderly society if we adopted that point of view?

But if the response to another's crime takes away my unalienable right or rights, it is difficult to blame the offender for the loss of my rights.

How many who despise the Patriot Act blame Al Qaida for its implementation?

Yet if you break the law in order to save my life, I will not want you to suffer any consequence for breaking the law.

It is a puzzlement is it not?
 
 
it's new terrain and it dredges up a lot of important issues that will have lasting ramifications.

Not the least of which is what do we do about cyber warriors who attack government and corporate sites that are attacking their associates but not attacking Der Spiegel, The Guardian or the NYT?

IMHO..it won't dampen civil liberties. The more documents I am seeing the more I am getting angry about what our government is keeping from us.

President Bush allowing the Russians a conduit to sell weapons in the Sudan is reprehensible. Even if they did nothing about it..they should have made it public that this was on-going.
 
 
The Chinese dissident, IIRC, didn't receive stolen classified information from a traitor so I'm just not seeing the comparison.

btw, have you heard what was released about Dubya today?

no, but i've heard whiny stuffs about obama's admin....

is this a bombshell ravi...i'm so excited....post it!!!!!
 
 
I'd support giving him the Peace Prize, even though it's essentially worthless.

Sometimes it's best to not open Pandora's box... But, before he is shot we should pull out fingernails until he spills all the beans. Then shoot him.
 
 
Despite the OP's description of the 'lawless Bush Administration', all I read re that from the Wikileaks is that Wikileaks backed up President Bush and WMD to the hilt including the infamous 'yellow cake' controversy. Of course we didn't see much of that in the mainstream press did we?

So is there some new revelation this week?

Nothing backs up Bush's assertions.
 
 
Considering that Yasser Arafat, Al Gore, and Obambi all won the Nobel Prize, Assange getting it twould be fittin'.

Nope. And in fact nothing released is really damning...which is why I firmly believe this guy is nothing more than a fucktard looking to make a quick buck at our expense.

How do you know? You haven't read any of the cables.
 
 
Well, they gave one to Obama even though he didn't do anything other than be a black guy who replaced Bush. And they gave one to Gore because the Europeans absolutely love his cause. And they gave it to that microfinance guy, who creating something - a really neat something - that I still don't understand how it relates to peace.

So why not give it to Assange? It's not like he has done anything peaceful.

I have heard that Obama was embarrassed by the prize.

But that's mushy Europeans for you.
 
 
 
 
 
I'd give him the Nobel prize just to piss off the "let's-assassinate-people-we-don't-like" fascists.
 
 
If they can give it to Obama and the rest why not....Hell you Libs can throw a party for him for all I care.
 
 
It'd certainly be no less ridiculous that them giving it to Obama...
 
 
The issue of course is knowledge, just how much and what should be disseminated.

This is a tough, tough question.

This reminds me somewhat of the Pentagon Papers mess in the 1970s, which was instrumental in driving the final nail into the coffin of "trust the guys we elect because they know more and better than us."

Nothing? Put Wikileaks George W Bush in your browser. You find lots and lots and lots of stuff like this:

 
Wired magazine's contributing editor Noah Shachtman  a nonresident fellow at the liberal Brookings Institution  researched the 400,000 WikiLeaked documents released in October. Here's what he found: "By late 2003, even the Bush White House's staunchest defenders were starting to give up on the idea that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. But WikiLeaks' newly-released Iraq war documents reveal that for years afterward, U.S. troops continued to find chemical weapons labs, encounter insurgent specialists in toxins and uncover weapons of mass destruction (emphasis added).... Chemical weapons, especially, did not vanish from the Iraqi battlefield. Remnants of Saddam's toxic arsenal, largely destroyed after the Gulf War, remained. Jihadists, insurgents and foreign (possibly Iranian) agitators turned to these stockpiles during the Iraq conflict  and may have brewed up their own deadly agents."

Why would someone who has endangered diplomats worldwide be considered a candidate. I think a lifetime jail sentence would be more in line.

I would agree that if he has compromised public servants in any inappropriate way, that should not go unpunished. But the author of the OP piece doesn't seem to think that has been the case. And I'm reading other stuff where folks haven't been endangered so much as embarrassed. If this guy ever does go on trial here, it could be the most interesting trial we have EVER had, unless the Administration forces them to have closed trial with the files sealed forever. But can they do that?

Assange is merely a tool being used to force turmoil in this country and others.

Best thing we could do is just mow these people down. George Soros....all of those protestors because the threat they represent is beyond what anyone here will believe. It's the end of everything you know of. And it's being orchestrated by billionaires.

But of course we're too damned civilized to deal with this problem the only way it can be dealt with, and they're counting on that.

Where's your Columbia Law degree, Dave?
 
 
Okay, we are now deep into Page 3 of this thread and there have been a number of reasonable comments made by many of you.

But as the OP piece suggested, almost all of the attention seems to be directed at Assange himself and nobody seems interested in any of the provocative information he has been 'leaking'. He made the note that nobody in Congress seems to be interested in investigating the leaks themselves but rather are totally focused on Assange.

Why is that do you think?
 
 
I'm TOTALLY interested more on the leaked info, but I mean, it seemed like the focus of the OP is on Assange.

The fact that the entire focus of Congress is to demonize and sabre-rattle against Assange is hilarious too. Why is that? Because it's easy! You can get votes! If you go around investigating people for the things the leaks say, you're gonna ruffle feathers and its not as visible to the moronic, blood-thirsty public as just getting this evil guy with a foreign accent executed and assassinated.

It looks like, then, you're not allowed to have opinions on the United States' affairs, since you're not a citizen.

Well the OP was about Assange, yes, but it also focused on what the leaks are revealing and nobody seems to be interested. I took the thesis of the OP piece to not necessarily canonize Assange, but to show that he could be providing an important and necessary service--however, the Congress doesn't want it.

The right seems to support it's fair share of bloodthirsty criminal types as well. The difference seems to be the left is less supportive of violence then the right.

IMHO..it won't dampen civil liberties. The more documents I am seeing the more I am getting angry about what our government is keeping from us.

 

I hope you are right but now that Assange is held in the UK our government wants to charge him while they can extradite him.

The problem is they have no case under current law so they may have to pass new law to get him in prison. But that runs afoul of the 1st amendment. That is where civil liberties are threatened.

But he wasn't secretly taken to a secret prison or "disappeared". The wheels of Justice are working here..so I would say the system is "righting" itself.

If he is a criminal why won't the DOJ charge him with anything? Truth is they don't have the grounds and are looking into every creative new way that they can charge him, so far nada.

I think they do have something..but it's not very strong. Receiving stolen property is probably just about all they can get him on. But will probably happen is some sort of deal where the US government has an opportunity to at least see what he intends to put up on his site and redact what is too sensitive.
 
 
Seems to me that the government doesn't have any trouble keeping secret stuff that they REALLY don't want us to see. The alleged alien spacecraft crash at Roswell for instance is still classified more than 60 years later and even our Congressman couldn't get access to the file. He tried.

As I read recently, all they have to do is hand over the top secret stuff to whoever has Obama's birth certificate and college transcripts under lock and key, and Assange would never have gotten hold of anything.

How many Nobel Prize winners have  allegations of rape, sexual molestation and unlawful coercion, and have been accused of pinning one woman's arms and using his body weight to hold her down during one alleged assault, and of raping a woman while she was sleeping  ?

Just saying...

It isn't conspiracy stuff. It is a fact.

You have the federal government looking for some international thug or warlord and CNN and just about everybody else on the planet are interviewing him but our 'authorities' never can seem to catch up with him to arrest him.

The story of the crash at Roswell is well documented here in New Mexico. The Congressman in my district, who might be the greatest guy anybody ever elected to high office, took it on as a pet project to find out the real skinny on that. He struck out. The files were closed and he could not get them.

And yeah, I was joking about the birth certificate and transcripts, but you'll have to admit they're having absolutely no trouble keeping those secret with thousands itching to get their hands on them. Yet Julian Assange seems to be able to access all the classified stuff he wants. But instead of demanding investigation of some of the really provocative stuff he is publishing, there is an amazing lack of curiosity or concern about it. Instead they want his head on a platter.

Doesn't it make you wonder just a little bit?
 
 
I agree, of course, Foxfyre, with the solid thinking. Yes, the government is exceptionally good at hiding stuff. I wonder if Assange's group will release the stuff on Roswell. Whatever they would release would be blockbuster, would it not? However, I doubt they can get that.
 
 
The government won't come clean on basic things like the cause of 9/11 and the actual findings of the Warren commission. Not to even venture into terrain like intel on Iraq's WMD, the real deal behind the kidnapping of Manuel Noriega, assassinations of JFK and Malcom X and COINTELPRO, as well as numerous black flag operations already regarded as confirmed history.

The bottom line behind this whole mess is that our government needs to preserve it's ability to scrutinize every e-mail we ever send but can't allow us to know about a million daily aspects of it's business.

Why? because they operate above the law and we operate below it. They have a license to break the law and we are held accountable for following the law even tho it is impossible to know what the law is.

The law is simply a tool to divide the powerful from the powerless. And secrecy is power. So is absolute invasion of other's secrecy.

 
The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.

 

Until our government honors this amendment they can go fuck themselves.
 
 
 
Yet Julian Assange seems to be able to access all the classified stuff he wants. But instead of demanding investigation of some of the really provocative stuff he is publishing, there is an amazing lack of curiosity or concern about it. Instead they want his head on a platter.

Doesn't it make you wonder just a little bit?

 

The reason why Julian Assange has access to all this classified stuff is because he is a focal point for informants who have information they want out. The wikileaks cables came from one man.

 
 How 250,000 US embassy cables were leaked | World news | guardian.co.uk 

 
An innocuous-looking memory stick, no longer than a couple of fingernails, came into the hands of a Guardian reporter earlier this year. The device is so small it will hang easily on a keyring. But its contents will send shockwaves through the world's chancelleries and deliver what one official described as "an epic blow" to US diplomacy.

The 1.6 gigabytes of text files on the memory stick ran to millions of words: the contents of more than 250,000 leaked state department cables, sent from, or to, US embassies around the world.

 

 
Intended to be read by officials in Washington up to the level of the secretary of state, the cables are generally drafted by the ambassador or subordinates. Although their contents are often startling and troubling, the cables are unlikely to gratify conspiracy theorists. They do not contain evidence of assassination plots, CIA bribery or such criminal enterprises as the Iran-Contra scandal in the Reagan years, when anti-Nicaraguan guerrillas were covertly financed.

One reason may be that America's most sensitive "top secret" and above foreign intelligence files cannot be accessed from Siprnet, the defence department network involved.

 

 
The US military believes it knows where the leak originated. A soldier, Bradley Manning, 22, has been held in solitary confinement for the last seven months and is facing a court martial in the new year. The former intelligence analyst is charged with unauthorised downloads of classified material while serving on an army base outside Baghdad. He is suspected of taking copies not only of the state department archive, but also of video of an Apache helicopter crew gunning down civilians in Baghdad, and hundreds of thousands of daily war logs from military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.

It was childishly easy, according to the published chatlog of a conversation Manning had with a fellow-hacker. "I would come in with music on a CD-RW labelled with something like 'Lady Gaga' … erase the music … then write a compressed split file. No one suspected a thing... [I] listened and lip-synched to Lady Gaga's Telephone while exfiltrating possibly the largest data spillage in American history." He said that he "had unprecedented access to classified networks 14 hours a day 7 days a week for 8+ months".

 

 
 
 
 
 
IMHO..it won't dampen civil liberties. The more documents I am seeing the more I am getting angry about what our government is keeping from us.

 

I hope you are right but now that Assange is held in the UK our government wants to charge him while they can extradite him.

The problem is they have no case under current law so they may have to pass new law to get him in prison. But that runs afoul of the 1st amendment. That is where civil liberties are threatened.

 

They tried a lot of stuff with Daniel Ellsberg, back in the day, too.
 
 
 
Can someone explain to me the Left's support for and idolization of criminals? I don't get it.

 

Encouragement of anarchy.

Best way to bring a society down is from within. Communists and progressives understand what makes a society vital so they work on a target country by infiltration using the youth of that country to destroy it from within.

It began when we started doubting our leaders. Eventually we'll doubt everything.

They divide us to the point where we now have a President that would sooner negotiate with Communists then Republicans.

All they need to do is ruin the economy and within months American society will be destroyed to the cheers of millions of these young Americans this agenda has created.
 
 
I suppose that in order to come down on one side or the other of the debate about the WIKILEAKS, one would have to be in a position to KNOW whether or not the information leaked was truly something that needed to be kept secret from the public.

As none of us here have read all the data, and I doubt any of us are in positions to truly understand how releasing that data effects this nation's national security or relations with other countries, we cannot really KNOW who has the higher moral ground regarding this affair.

What we do know is that our government does have secrets it ought to keep secret and we ALSO KNOW that our government has a habit of keeping things secret that are not national secrets, but merely embarrassing facts that the government would prefer not to announce to its citizens.

I strongly suspect that in this case BOTH KINDS OF DATA were released,

And if that is the case, then really this leak is really a blessing AND a curse.

Most of the really bad stuff happened in the last two years but Obama acts like none of it has anything to do with him. He's going off to be with Michelle...as he claimed...and letting Prez. Clinton do his job during a matter of national security.

He doesn't give a fly-f about the shit-storm he's got going on around him.

Let's face it....things happen that you don't want folks to know about. However; should you do the things you want to keep secret? I'd rather we didn't.....but then again it doesn't help when you spread it all over the place. Let me assure you....we're choirboys compared to Russia, China, or anyone else that might be critical of us.

Btw....wasn't it revealed about two months ago the White House openly asked for access to Pentagon records to investigate possible GOP contenders? Who's to say they didn't release all of this other stuff while they were at it.

The right seems to support it's fair share of bloodthirsty criminal types as well. The difference seems to be the left is less supportive of violence then the right.

You have pretty well described the opinion I am gradually forming about this I think. First, I do not want ANYBODY compromising national security or the lives of our allies and public servants anywhere.

But I am absolutely appalled at some of the stuff coming out and nobody seems to care about that. I think the author of the OP nailed it. Kill the messenger. Ignore the message of a government that has become so corrupt it barely represents us at all any more.
 
 
 
 
 
Since you are left, and I am right, and we agree that Assange should be charged for his part in disseminating stolen information, I would venture that this is an issue that has no partisan 'side'. Only the moronic libertarians are high fiving the bastard.... but libertarians are, generally, very naive.

 

sigh...damn, I hate it when we agree.

 

I hate it more than you do.

 

I personally love it.

It's like when a cat fight leads to hot girl-on-girl action.
 
 
 
Ignore the message of a government that has become so corrupt it barely represents us at all any more.

 

I'm willing to bet that any of the stuff that Wikileaks is getting is new.

This has been going on FOREVER. I guarantee.

It's not pure stupidity. A great deal of it has to do with gullibility. All a despot has to do is wrap his arms around one of these progressives causes and they have a friend for life. The progressives will look the other way and claim it never happened when the shit blows up in their faces. They'll fight tooth and nail anyone who dares to stop their favorite benefactor even though their agendas are in complete opposition. It's how they can support Conservative Islamic-fundamentalists and hate Conservative Christians at the same time. At least the suicide bomber wants to save the planet. Those Rat-bastard Republicans are just evil racists who want to poison babies.....or at least the ones the progressives will let live long enough to be born into this world.

Sounds a lot like what the statists are doing for the government in this situation. Simply ignoring the crimes of the state to focus on Assange and WikiLeaks.

Mud, I taught you last year how you projected your insecurities and fears on others. The 'hostage takers' are the far right is this case. The far right GOP leadership does need to be punished. That you equate that, dear mudimbecile, with violence is the epitome of stupidity.

There is no Hostage Takers here. The left wants to frame this like the right is to blame for allowing this issue to fester for ten fucken years......when in fact they are the ones responsible. They are the ones that put the 10 yr time frame on this legislation. They've been talking about this for years and now it's about to expire and they don't want to be blamed for raising all of our taxes.

This is their baby now. After all...they are in the majority. They hold the keys to the car and they are the ones responsible for getting it out of the ditch.....and they are the ones trying to use class-warfare instead of doing what everyone admits is the best thing to get this economy going again.

Uh huh.    You did see me explain his position , though, and you failed to criticize it.

 
As for always siding with the left, I suggest you look at this thread where Sallow and I disagree with one another quite a bit.

 The Accumlation of Wealth is not protected by the Constitution. 

 

I've only been over the first page of that thread. The lefty sense of entitlement to that which they didn't earn is disgusting.

 

I wouldn't criticize somebody over somebody else's characterization of what they said.

Then you see that I don't always side with the "left."
 
 
 
 
 
Dance robodavetard.  

 

Here's how this part of the thread has worked:

Jake arrogantly dismisses anyone who doesn't toe the lefty line.

Conservatives make fun of him for being an arrogant leftist.

Jake says, "Ummm...yeah, I meant to do that!" and pretends he's calling the tune.  

 

Jake dismisses one side hypocrisy.

 

And you participate in the other side's.  

 
Only a few wingnut reactionaries trying to pretend they are responsible conservatives are unhappy with me. Their reaction merely proves I am on the right track.

Yes, you are a robotard and a hypocrite believing America is served by your unAmerican values.

Don't like it? Change for the better, man.

 

  Kid, you're a far-left liberal. You're not fooling anyone.

But you didn't go back to see what he said? If what you think I was doing was so awful...

And the reason for that will be left for the readers to decide.

And yet another Grand Pronouncement from LeftyJake.  
 
 
A flat statement of fact, daveman. What topic have you ever demonstrated that you were correct?
