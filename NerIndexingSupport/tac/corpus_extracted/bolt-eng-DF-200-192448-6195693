For those of you who don't know what the Imperial Federation is, read this.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Federation 

The Imperial Federation was a proposal to turn the British Empire into a federated superstate, which would combine the benefits of a large power with that of small, efficient governing. Member of this Federation would likely have been the largely British-descended dominions of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, as well as Ireland and South Africa.

"Supporters of Imperial Federation regarded the United Kingdom as having two possible futures; imperial union and continued long-term importance or imperial dissolution and the reduction of the status of the UK to a second-class nation."

Looking back now, we know that the British Government chose the latter choice. But, should the first choice have been taken? With an Imperial Federation, Britain might have maintained its status as a big international power, instead of the decline we witnessed in the 20th century.

FACTS:

Using contemporary statistics, the Imperial Federation consisting of the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Ireland would have had:

A population of roughly 125 million

An economy with a nominal value of 5.381 trillion dollars, which would have made it the second largest in the World

Would have spanned three continents
 
 
Would have been brilliant.
 
 
The Canadians, Australians, Irish, New Zealanders and South Africans wanted to be independent for a reason.

It was more like they were given home-rule. In a federation, they would have had home-rule, with Imperial issues like foreign policy and military being decided in the Imperial parliament.

Precisely.

Ask a Canadian, Australian, Irishman, New Zealander or a South African if he'd like to rejoin the good old jolly good empire, and form a federation.

As I said, they're independent for a reason, take the hint.

I hardly think that the Irish, who were persecuted by the English for 800 years would find it particularly brilliant.

Depends how you ask it.

If you say would you like to rejoin the good old jolly empire of course they would say no. However, this is not an empire, it is a federation.

Give each country equal standing, and it would be great.

The possibility of an Imperial Federation today is dead and buried since long. This is if it would have been a desirable choice a hundred or more years ago, before home-rule.

But doesn't that kind of go the against Britain being an important international power? In that kind of federation it would just be one part of a larger whole. Britain itself would probably be no more significant than any other part of this federation, except historically speaking.

It would've collapsed anyway, in the same fashion that the empire did.

It'd essentially be a 'Greater Britain', due to the fact that the population of these dominions were largely (and still constitute a decent majority today) British-descended.

There's a difference between the empire and the USA.

People in the US are American, they're not Californian or Mississippian, they're American. Moreover, these states aren't countries.

Had the Canadians, Australians etc wanted to remain part of the empire, they'd have clearly said something about forming a federation.

There is a clear distinction between Empire and Federation.
The Empire is for the benefit of the United Kingdom.
Federation is for the benefit of all involved.

Very different.

Had the other nations wanted it, wouldn't they have said something?

Moreover, what's stopping it from happening? Oh wait, the fact that none of the nations mentioned other than the UK actually want it.

The countries involved were given home-rule by Britain in the 19th century, and didn't quite demand to be separate from Britain (except Ireland). And even though they had home-rule, they were Dominions of the British Empire, nominally part of it (and thus also allied with Britain during the World Wars).

Today the Federation is a near-impossibility, but it was not in the 19th century. If the British Governments had chosen to do so, they could have implemented home-rule as part of a federation instead of making the Dominions de-facto independent. The possibility of this is really what is being discussed, not the CURRENT political situation.

I'm well aware of what we're discussing, however had this been a great system, the question: why are all of these countries now independent springs to mind immediately. Wouldn't someone have mentioned the idea and put it before the King or Queen? It would have helped the UK enormously, because let's face it the glory days are over and in today's world everything's uphill, especially for the UK, however isn't a federation meant to consist of states near each other, I couldn't have seen it actually working to be honest.

The only thing I can see stopping it from happening in today's world, is the fact that no one, and I mean not one country, other than perhaps the UK actually want it.

The glory days are over, time to move on.
 
 
We may not get a full blown federation, but we can definitely increase the strength and power of the Commonwealth of Nations.

EDIT:

Also, if we had this Federation, it is possible that France would have joined. Remember that France had applied to join the Commonwealth, and also asked the British Government to join France in a Union of countries.

It would have resulted in a two-tier Commonwealth amongst other things.

Americans weren't always American. California was an independent country at one point. The American identity formed over quite a short amount of time, and it consisted of people who came from many different backgrounds. Who's to say that if the idea of the Imperial Federation went ahead, the same wouldn't have happened? I suppose it is possible that a "Greater Britain" identity would have formed.

Does anyone else think the Imperial Federation sounds like it's from Star Wars?
 
 
I think we can safely say the UK didn't want it at the time, as it didn't happen.
There were a minority of politicians that wanted it. Namely from the Conservative Party which is somewhat interesting.

At that point, I doubt any of them did. Decolonialisation was right expressly because of the imperial relationship. Change that to a federal one, and there's no real constitutional problem with a wide-spanning empire.

Britain is, and always has been, enormously conservative. Proposals like this would never be considered on their merits quite simply because they were too grand. A bit like Sir Christopher Wren's plans to rebuild London - that would have been great.

No, that's just something you've invented.

Scotland and Wales, enormously conservative, you're joking right? England has always been enormously conservative, perhaps you're a conservative but to label the UK as a conservative country simply isn't true.

I'll agree with you on that point though, a federation would've been a little too big in those days.

 
No, that's just something you've invented.
 

Today's federations all share borders with one another other, perhaps it's just a coincidence then.

 
Oh shut up. What narrow-minded, bigoted, Irish Nationalist nonsense.
 

Take a wild guess at why the Irish hate the English, call it nonsense if you want to but when something's staring you in the face you can't walk your way round it.

Fair enough, however the US states, for the most part, all border one another. Could this federation really have worked when Australia and Canada are at opposite ends of the world?

It does a bit...

 
 
 
I do wonder how an elected official from Australia would be able to meaningfully represent Australians in Westminster.

I mean, what was the London-Sidney journey time around the turn of the century? The better part of a month, I'd warrant. There can't be any reasonable response to 'local concerns' given that time delay. There can't be any reasonable relationship between a representative and their constituents given that they barely interact. Indeed, there can be hardly any relationship between what an Australian representative does and what the Australian people want done.

This doesn't seem like a tenable federation.

Apparently, 1880 or so it took the same amount of time for a representative from Australia to get to Britain as it took a Californian to get to D.C
 
 
Nope, it seems a bit Orwellian to me - big federations become super states, other countries for alliances to combat other federations economic power, suddenly you have Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia and permanent war.

Well I don't know the precise definition of a federation from some political philosopher but the EU seems to fit the general description: "the act of constituting a political unity out of a number of separate states or colonies or provinces so that each member retains the management of its internal affairs".
 
 
For all intensive purposes, I must say without doubt that it would fail. Fail to reach its objective and become both a physical and a moral hindrance to all states involved. For one thing, as was previously stated, doesn't this seem a bit like the EU? and isn't there a lot of hubbub about England (Conservatives rightly enough) that want out of the EU, considering it a financial drain on the UK.
Secondly, in this supposed imperial federation, would it operate in a similar manner to Westminster and the devolved governments of the UK? A continuous friction between imperial, central and local government would exist in such a system. Party politics would take president over the will of the people, an entirely left-middle SNP/Labour Scotland being opposed by the collective will of England to suffer sovereignty of a far-middle right wing party (foreboding the pathetic return of a Conservative government at Westminster).
Now think of this repeating in Australia, isolated and stigmatized by an imperial power centralized within the reach of the most influential states (Europe or US if it were to span the globe).

Really? I know by 1869 the Transcontinental rail line had been built; it took about seven days to get from California to the Great Lakes. I don't know how long the rest of the journey would take, but it was in the North East. That means lots of modern rail roads. I.e not that long. This does leave me rather sceptical, unfortunately.

Maybe I'm wrong to be. But even so we're ignoring the vital importance of telegrams. By 1880 it was rather easy to get a telegram across America. It's quite another task to get a telegram from London across the world. Basically, a Californian representative in Washington knows what's going on in California. An Australian representative in Westminster would not know what's going on in Australia.

It's also worth pointing out that the United States is largely contiguous. There's two effects to interest us here. Firstly; regionalism. States in certain regions share much the same interests. When you take these regions as a whole, you really reduce the average distance from Washington. Concurrently, but more importantly, the contiguity means that there is not a sharp divide between representatives from X area and representatives from Y area. That is, if we take distance from Washington as the relevant metric and analyse the values for each district, the 'gradient' is relatively small. No 'group' of representatives are completely isolated from the rest of the legislature (in this manner). In contrast, British representatives operate under manifestly different pressures than Canadian or Australian representatives would. There would be a clear and deleterious divide in Parliament.

I think using the US to support this idea is fraught with difficulty. Last but not least we should remember that the US doesn't allow their capital to have a part in federal government. Would we really want to disenfranchise London in such a way?

Scotland is a far more conservative place than England, particularly historically, but even today. Then again, I think you've simply failed to understand the meaning of the word 'conservative'.

 
Today's federations all share borders with one another other, perhaps it's just a coincidence then.
 

No they don't. To think of just one example off the top of my head: Alaska. Equally, countries like France and the Netherlands have their existing colonies as an integral part of the mother country's constitutional framework, even today.

 
Take a wild guess at why the Irish hate the English, call it nonsense if you want to but when something's staring you in the face you can't walk your way round it.
 

There is a lot of anti-English racism in Ireland. I will not dignify such vile, backward and revolting views by pretending there can be any justification for them. If you want to sit isolated and try to defend racists and bigots, feel free - but I don't think you'll find much support.

In that case you should start by expressing yourself more cleary. I assumed you were talking about politics which is why I laughed when I read your post.

 
No they don't. To think of just one example off the top of my head: Alaska. Equally, countries like France and the Netherlands have their existing colonies as an integral part of the mother country's constitutional framework, even today.
 

Alaska and Hawaii are hardly integral US states, and as you may have noticed they're still quite close to the other US states, nothing quite like what this federation would like look, with Australia and Canada at opposite ends of the world.

As for French Guiana, it too is hardly an integral part of France, if anything it costs more to keep it than it's actually worth.

Most of the US states border each other, most of the Russian states border each other, all of the Mexican states border each other, all of the Brazilian states border each other, do you see the pattern evolving here?

I'm not defending them, but to say that Ireland would have happily joined up in this federation is ludicrous considering that a huge percentage of the population hated the English, the hate may have simmered down today however in this scenario we're not talking about today.

Not at all.

There are very big differences between a European Union and a Federation based on the British Empire. I am surprised you cannot work it out

I didn't say it wasn't political - what I rejected was the idea that conservatism belongs to one political party. If it was referring to that party then I would have been using a proper noun and the initial 'c' would have been capitalised.

Yes they are; and no, they're not.

I think you need to invest in a globe rather than looking at a two-dimensional map with Britain at the centre.

It is, entirely.

Both the (integrated) EU and a British Federation would be based on a federation of states. The only difference I can notice is the elevated role of the UK in the latter, which I suspect is your only reason for supporting it.

It is not my only reason, but it is a big reason.

This is where I would like to clarify my European position. I do not support the European Union, but I do support a European Union.

I suspect this is the position of every eurosceptic in the country. Nobody wants Britain to sit on its cold little island with her fingers in her ears. But neither do we want to be the 27th State of Europe. It's totally unreasonable to suggest that people against the latter are in favour of the former.

Ultimately, the very idea of federations crossing great boundaries was problematic. Think, for example, of the logistical problems for a representative of California reaching the United States Capitol before the great mountains were tamed and railway lines laid.

If you're asking me if those problems were insurmountable, then I'd definitely say no - there are very few great efforts which cannot be made with the proper will.

Plus, of course, there isn't really any criteria for a state 'working'. I mean, all countries inevitably fall - it's just a matter of how long they last.
 
 
What's stopping Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and the UK from forming their own federation?

Canada may reject as it has plans on forming a North American Union alongside Mexico and the US, South Africa may also reject as plans for a United States of Africa grow seemingly stronger day by day. However Australia, New Zealand and the British overseas territories could easily form one, could this work in this day and age and would it be possible?
 
 
It was and still is a good idea. However it is killed by defence considerations. Canada has no nearby enemies. Britain has Russia/Europe (depending on time period), and Australia has China/Japan (depending on time period). It would turn into Canada subsidising two military establishments at opposite ends of Eurasia. It might still be workable if the people involved genuinely felt themselves to be countrymen, but it seems that they did and do not. Rather, it was a combination of self-interest and inertia that held the Empire together so long as the UK was a useful benefactor, and as soon as this ceased to be the case Aus/NZ and Canada immediately abandoned Britain and supplanted her with America.

Plus, the present push seems to be toward plutocratic continent-states. I don't understand why people think this a good idea, but they seem to.

So.... essentially they want to Britain to hold a special elevated position above the other states? Sounds like nationalism to me.

Erm... Canada didn't really have rosy relations with the US by any means (1812 and all) when the idea of a imperial federation was bandied about.

But when the Empire split up, which is what Collingwood was talking about, Canadian-American relations were strong.

Anyway, in regards to your point about nationalism, I think that just depends on your opinion. If you think that Britain is the same as Slovakia (and this is true in the European balance, with the exception of votes in QMV) you are a mentalist. Britain cannot negotiate her own trade treaties with India, or the United States, or China, all of whom are going to be more relevant and powerful in the world than Europe.

It's true Britain can never be a superpower. But she can be the sort of great power that Britain looked to for assistance a hundred years ago. One of the few powers who weighs the sides of the superpowers. We can be far more relevant, more prosperous, and more influential if we were detached from the European polity than we are now.

Canada didn't exist in 1812. Imperial Federation is a turn of the 20th century idea. Canadian defence is hardly worth bothering with: it is indefensible against US attack (which is ridiculous anyway), and the US would never allow anyone else to attack it. The most sensible outcome is to become part of the US.
