Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez arrived in the isolated ex-Soviet republic of
Belarus on Tuesday, officials here said, after he made a splashy visit to the
Venice film festival.

"Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has arrived for a two-day working visit to
Belarus," the Belarussian foreign ministry said.

Chavez was due to meet Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko later on
Tuesday for talks that would resume on Wednesday, according to the Belarussian
president's press service.

Chevaz, a firebrand leftist known for his anti-US tirades, was making his fourth
visit to Belarus since 2005. He has friendly relations with Lukashenko, a
strongman who was once dubbed "Europe's last dictator" by Washington.

Minsk and Caracas have previously held talks on Belarussian assistance in
strengthening the Venezuelan military, as well as on energy deals.

On Monday, Chavez visited the Venice film festival to attend a screening of a
documentary about himself by US filmmaker Oliver Stone.
