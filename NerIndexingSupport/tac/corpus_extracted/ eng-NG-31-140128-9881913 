I can only hope but think? Squeelers are the talk of the town kicking
ass and taking names, lose in the POs. Next year Colts are the Â talk
of the league and the Squeelers don't look so good, but the Squeelers
peek at just the right time and manage a SB win. The San Diego is
dominating and going places while the Colts look beatable. San Diego
loses and Colts peak going to the PO and win the big one. Maybe this
year the trend continues?
