Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., a pivotal lawmaker in the health-care debate,
wants to deliver coverage to the uninsured by starting up new cooperatives
modeled on rural electric cooperatives that were founded during the Great
Depression.

But rural electric cooperatives have a mixed track record, experts say.
They brought electricity to millions of rural Americans who lacked it in the
1930s and today serve about 14 percent of Americans. But after 75 years, the
rural electric cooperatives still rely heavily on federal credit subsidies,
have weak balance sheets and, some studies suggest, operate less efficiently
than privately-owned utilities.

Over the past three years, some rural electric cooperatives have also
come under criticism for excessive payments to executives and for pushing
forward with new coal-fired power plants at a time when many people
concerned with climate change want to slow down or halt such plants. Yet
they remain politically powerful through the National Rural Electric
Cooperative Association.

Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tenn., a critic of rural electric cooperatives,
agrees with Conrad that health-care cooperatives could help provide coverage
for the roughly 47 million uninsured Americans. "I want everybody covered
and I want it to be affordable," Cooper said. "Co-ops could do that. They
are a time-honored mechanism for almost all of rural America. ... They're
kind of an interesting third way, halfway between the public and private
sector."

But he warns that the new cooperatives would require close regulation to
avoid many of the problems he says afflict rural electric co-ops. "You still
have to watch co-ops like a hawk," he said. He said that rural electric
cooperatives "became too big for their britches" and "indistinguishable from
for-profit firms except that they love government subsidies." In an article
in the Harvard Journal on Regulation last year, Cooper argued that rural
electric co-ops "turned away from their historic role" and had taken on
"deeply troubling anti-consumer behaviors."

Rural electric cooperatives -- nonprofit organizations owned by their
customers -- date back to 1935, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt created
the Rural Electrification Administration to bring power to poor and remote
farm areas. Rural poverty at the time was captured in the 1939 book of
photos by Walker Evans and text by James Agee titled "Let Us Now Praise
Famous Men," which Agee opens by describing writing by the light of a
coal-oil lamp.

Today, electric lines reach into virtually every household in America,
and many of the once-rural areas served by cooperatives have become part of
sprawling urban areas, such as Dallas-Fort Worth or Northern
Virginia.

Yet they still rely on cheap, subsidized financing from the Rural
Utilities Service, part of the Agriculture Department, which provides direct
loans and loan guarantees. Co-ops also get financing from the National Rural
Utilities Cooperative Finance Corp., a cooperative bank that in turn relies
on billions of dollars of low-cost financing from the federal government and
the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corp., a government-sponsored enterprise
commonly known as Farmer Mac.

On June 11, Farmer Mac chief executive Michael Gerber said in
congressional testimony that Farmer Mac had lent the CFC $1.8 billion and
that it planned to boost that figure by another $1 billion. He said Farmer
Mac planned to pool the loans, turn them into securities, provide guarantees
of timely payment and sell them to investors.

"A co-op by definition has several major advantages over private
tax-paying corporations," said Ken Glozer, a former Office of Management and
Budget official and president of a consulting firm called OMB Professionals.
"They don't pay taxes, they borrow all their money from the U.S. government
because they because can't raise capital, and they are political as hell
because they depend on the government. Over time they will seek and get
untold favors that a private company won't be able to get."

Glozer added that cooperatives are "quasi-federal agencies."

Conrad argues that co-ops can be effective, citing the success of the
model at Land O'Lakes, Ace Hardware and Group Health, a health care co-op
with 600,000 members in Washington state, as well as the at the rural
electric co-ops. In a recent opinion piece published in USA Today, he said
that co-ops would be "a public-interest alternative, but consumer-controlled
and not government-run."

But others have reached different conclusions. In his article on rural
co-ops last year, Cooper said: "Co-ops in some regions of the country have
been doing a particularly poor job of protecting member interests."

Robert Reischauer, president of the Urban Institute and former director
of the Congressional Budget Office, said rural electric cooperatives aren't
a good model for health insurance regardless of their track record.

"Those were providing a service where no private enterprise wanted to
operate because the population density was too low and the capital costs
were too high," he said. "And what we're talking about is trying to create a
viable insurer that would operate in metropolitan areas and rural areas and
suburban areas."

Reischauer added that a firm capable of providing effective health
insurance needs to be big, because that would bring economies of scale in
administration and market power necessary to bargain with health-care
providers. Rural electric cooperatives, by contrast, tend to be local. There
are around 800 rural electric cooperatives nationwide, including 16 in
Conrad's home state of North Dakota.

"What you want is something that is big and nimble at the same time,"
Reischauer said.
