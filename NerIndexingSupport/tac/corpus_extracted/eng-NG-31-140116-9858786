Do you call the Islanders the NY Islanders or the Uniondale Islanders?

The Auburn Hills Pistons?

I think any reasonably intelligent person knows that east Rutherford
is a suburb of nyc.....so by extension, they can be called a NY
team....I mean, everything north of the end of the collector lanes on
the turnpike is a nyc suburb

But with your argument in mind.....were the Washington capitals/
bullets ever called the Maryland Caps/bullets, because as you likely
know, they did not play in Washington until very recently....

to keep it to football......the redskins no longer play in
washington....so do we need to call them the Maryland Redskins?

hotel......

Most people aren't very familiar with the collector lanes on the
turnpike or the various suburbs of NYC.   They simply know that the Giants
play in the swamps of Jersey.

 

But they did play in Washington at one time.   Hence, the Washington
Redskins.

Don't be so obtuse.  You know damned well there's a huge difference between
not knowing "anything" about NYC and not knowing about NJ toll roads and the
geography of the suburbs.

 

Not everyone travels to NYC.  That hardly means they're somehow deficient.
Quit being so NYC-centric.  You don't see assholes from Beijing in here
saying you need to go back to school because you don't know about the
substructure of their city.

 

Yeah, misguided idiots consider it a priority for children learn about the
roadways of NYC.  If that's the type of person you like to hang around, be
my guest.  But that goes back to my original point...   it's no wonder that
people have no sense of what education is or should be.

it would appear that not only do most people not avoid NYC, most make
it a point to go there....

dont get me wrong, I hate all their sports teams, but the city is
fabulous to visit....

when phish left mass in 95 to do their big new years show at msg, it
was a big kick  in the crotch....by the time 98 rolled around and they
were on their 3rd nye at the garden, we all loved going down there.....

Yeah, I travel the pike a few times a year, and I don't know for sure.  I
know that there are several lanes out around where 84 comes on (4 initially,
I thought?).  But I also thought there was a 3 lane stretch out by
Springfield at 91.  I suppose not.

So the fact that I don't know these inane things about the number of lanes
or the distribution of toll booths must mean I need to go back to the 5th
grade.  After all, every child should know this stuff!  [Explain to me again
why 5th graders need to know details about the roadways...?]
