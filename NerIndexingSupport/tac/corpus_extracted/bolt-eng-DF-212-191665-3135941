Where is Brigadier Ray? Why has the WABs most prolific Poster gone quiet so suddenly?   Hope it was'nt the Butter cookies  
 
 
Possibly on holiday. I do believe he said something about going to Lesotho but that was in April.

Thanks Guys! He has'nt been "on air" for quite a time, and as the Meeting is not for almost another week it seems strange for him not to Post...Hope all is well
 
 
40th Anniversary of his Commissioning. Won't be back until late June.

Now that's what I call Party!!!  
 
 
Dave,

Thanks for worrying about me. I am still alive and kicking!  

My wife has an aversion to all things electronic except for the mobile/ cellphone, while I hate the mobile/ cellphone. Had enough of the radio sets while in the army. These sets never brought happy tidings!  

I tried to teach her how to communicate on the WAB when I am no more and post the news, but she refused to touch the computer. I think I will tell my children to do the needful.

I thought I had posted that I would be away for the Reunion commemorating our 40th year of commissioning. It was 46 degree Centigrade out there and we were all sweating even though it was held in the evening. It was great to meet coursemates, some for the first time after passing out of the Academy!

There are only two serving chaps from our course. One is the Southern Army Commander and the other is the Vice Chief, who is tipped to become the next Chief!
 
 
Welcome back Sir. I'm glad things went ok for you.
 
 
Brigadier Sir, 40yrs..How quickly time passes   I'm sure that you had a good time even though the weather was a little unkind...Nature has never been Human friendly..So, your Dear Wife is not Computer orientated!! Sad, as the Title of Post Mistress General will have to remain on hold   hopefully for many a year yet!!

On your 50th year Reunion, you will have to either choose a less "fierce" Month or a more temperate location  
 
 
Welcome back Ray   I am glad you had a good trip but it's a good thing you're back.Dave was totally out of control while you were gone.I think he and glyn were plotting some kind of coup.Look,they even strong-armed me into changing my name!     Good to have you back sir.  
 
 
Ray, are you sure you did'nt take Shameless, the former miscreant   known as Shamus into your 46 degree heat. The moment you departed he attempted a Coup-de-WAB calling himself Generalissimo!! Thankfully he was brought out of his delusion with the threat of never being awarded a tin of Butter Cookies...Normality was quickly resumed

I believe you meant to say"the miscreant fomerly known as Shamus".That about cover it???    
 
 
Dave must have visited a certain country to learn how to organise a bloodless coup!    

No offence meant to anyone or any country.

The Anniversaries will always be on 11 June since we were commissioned on 11 June 1967. The weather will always be unkind. Hopefully, they will decide to have it in the hills instead of Delhi.
