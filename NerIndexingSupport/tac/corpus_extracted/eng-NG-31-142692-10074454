Study: Media Narrows Field of Candidates

WASHINGTON (AP) - When it comes to presidential politics, the news
media loves front-runners. And seems to hate them, too.

Within the first five months of the presidential contest, the media
effectively had reduced the field to five candidates, even though
there were 17 mainstream Democrats and Republicans, a study of
political coverage found.

But the tone of the coverage for the top two front-runners - Democrat
Hillary Rodham Clinton  and Republican  Rudy Giuliani  - hardly was
friendly. Nearly four out of 10 stories were negative, more than three
out of 10 were neutral and only the rest were positive.

The study by the Project for Excellence in Journalism and the Joan
Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy, to be
released Monday, also portrays the political press as a hidebound
institution out of touch with the desires of citizens.

Among the findings:

Stories focused more on fundraising and polls than on where candidates
stood on the issues, despite a public demand for more attention to the
policies, views and records of the candidates.

The public's attention to campaign news is higher now than it was at
similar points in the past two elections, but that interest is only
shared by less than one in four people.

Five candidates - Democrats Clinton and Barack Obama  and Republicans
Giuliani, Mitt Romney and John McCain  - received more than half the
coverage. Elizabeth Edwards, the cancer-stricken wife of Democrat John
Edwards, received almost as much media attention as her husband.

Democrats, overall, got more coverage - and more positive ink and
airtime - than Republicans.

Obama enjoyed the friendliest coverage of the presidential field;
McCain endured the most negative. That was due in part to the media's
focus on fundraising; Obama raised more than expected and McCain
raised less.

The report is the most thorough analysis yet of media coverage of the
2008 presidential campaign and offers both a sober evaluation as well
as a dash of guidance on how to improve. But the report's authors are
not necessarily optimistic. They note that a study of the 2000
presidential election  reached similar conclusions.

They argue that this election could represent a generational struggle
in both parties, but that early media coverage failed to capture that
fundamental tension.

"If American politics is changing," the report concluded, "the style
and approach of the American press does not appear to be changing with
it."

Tom Rosenstiel, director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism,
said journalists face a conundrum: In a campaign that started as early
as this one, why spend resources in a detailed analysis of candidates
views and stances when the public is not that engaged? Or is the
public not engaged because the media is focusing on tactics and
insider stories that don't affect readers, viewers and listeners?

The report analyzed 1,742 articles about the presidential contest that
appeared from January through May in 48 news outlets including print,
online, network TV, cable and radio news and talk shows.
