The Andean Development Corporation (CAF), the Inter-American Development Bank
(IDB) and the World Bank (WB) hold 72 percent of Bolivia's external debt from
January to November 2010, according to a report published on Tuesday by the
Bolivian Central Bank (BCB).

According to the report, the external debt as of Nov. 30 reached 2.778 billion
U.S. dollars, 50 million dollars more than that in 2009, when multilateral and
bilateral debt were at 2.720 billion dollars.

Economic analyst Luis Ballivian told Xinhua that this external debt is expected
to increase in 2011, due to the expenditures that Bolivian President Evo Morales
has recently confirmed.

The BCB said the CAF is the main creditor with 1.119 billion dollars.
