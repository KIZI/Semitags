For anyone who is interested in how Gtech did at nationals, CWPA has a nice
write up on each game including a photo from the game. Click on the link
below and then click on the score of the game.

We finished a respectable 2-2 with loses to Cal Poly (1st place) and Utah
(9th place) and wins over Vtech and Minnesota.
