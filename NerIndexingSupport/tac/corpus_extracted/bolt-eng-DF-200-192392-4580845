He's Pakistani/White.. Zain Malik. He can sing, otherwise he wouldn't be there. Just needs to project his voice more...   and he's the eye candy of the group anyway.
 
 
It's the one with the lisp who can't sing. The blonde one. Eww.
 
 
No

Rebecca  
 
 
That liam guy irritates me so much tbh, I like the rest of them though.
 
 
Oh god no, D: I know the one that looks like he's miming (maths teachers were slagging him off and everything) Louis Tomlinson, and he's an arse. i'm sick of seeing his face in the local paper every day.. "louis still in xfactor!" duh, there's only been one live show?
 
 
Liam's sexy
