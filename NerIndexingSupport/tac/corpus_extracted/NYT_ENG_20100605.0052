In keeping with their position as the First Family
of Libertarianism, the Pauls of Lake Jackson, Texas, did not have
many rules around their home.

"Behave yourself and be polite" is how Rep. Ron Paul describes
his regulatory philosophy about rearing five children. Ron Paul, a
Republican, and his wife of 53 years, Carol, never believed in
assigned chores or mandates.

They did not give out allowances, which they viewed as a
parental version of a government handout. They did not believe in
strict curfews; Ron Paul says that unintended consequences -- like
speeding home to beat the clock -- can result from excessive
meddling from a central authority.

While Ron Paul's laissez-faire views produced a family of
likeminded thinkers -- "We're all on board," says the oldest son,
Ronnie Paul -- they inspired the middle child, Rand, to follow his
father's career path, first into medicine and now politics. If he
prevails in November after winning the Republican nomination for a
Senate seat in Kentucky last month, he and his father would form a
two-man libertarian dynasty.

Father and son are described as each other's political sounding
boards, confidants and support systems. "Dad and Rand spent hours
having great philosophical discussions about issues," said Joy
Paul Leblanc, the youngest sibling.

The two Pauls have similar economic ideologies, overlapping
organizations and Internet-based fundraising apparatuses. The elder
Ron Paul, 74, dispensed behind-the-scenes advice during his son's
bid for the Senate seat, in which he upset the favorite, Kentucky
Secretary of State Trey Grayson.

In a recent interview with The New York Times, Ron Paul, the
two-time libertarian presidential candidate, referred to his son's
campaign as "our race." When his son faced criticism recently
over comments that some interpreted as skeptical of federal civil
rights laws, the congressman was shaken.

Rand Paul, 47, who declined to be interviewed for this article,
has described his father as his political hero. But he is quick to
emphasize that he has never been dependent on him. "I think my dad
has helped me tremendously," he said in a joint interview with his
father for a Kentucky television station this year. "But the only
way I win is on my own two feet."

Family members say the congressman has been shaken by the recent
storm his son has faced over remarks in which he seemed to take
issue, on libertarian grounds, with the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

Ron Paul conceded that it is easier to be the candidate under
attack than to be a family member of one. "No matter how well you
arm yourself, no matter how well you know the system," he said in
the interview, "it really hurts when it's your son."
