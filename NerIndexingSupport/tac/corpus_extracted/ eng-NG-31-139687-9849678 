Marcus Roberts applies for admission to Texas Tech University

I have decided to apply for admission to Texas Tech University, as a
visiting undergraduate student. I hold a Bachelor of Science degree
from the Georgia Institute of Technology. I want to work with the
Chess program. I am also filing a civil rights complaint with the
United States Department of Justice, because Paul Troung has
threatened to kill me.
