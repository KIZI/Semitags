I know they're ranked #1.
I know the Gators just lost to an un-ranked Auburn at home.
I know they have (possibly superior) speed and talent.

The Gators are going to win.

Even though I predicted before the season that LSU would be UF's only loss
(twice).

Auburn messed that up for me, so the Gators are going to win tomorrow night
to make the world rite again.

Unless Mianderson bets money on them.

Then the Gators are absolutely snot-fucked.
