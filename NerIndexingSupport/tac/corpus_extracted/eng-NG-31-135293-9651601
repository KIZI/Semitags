Trac and mod_wsgi

Hi all

im Ruben and im trying to install Trac with Subversion in Linux
Centos. Im in the last step to finish the tutorial installation guide.
I have a doubt about mod_wsgi.

Im reading now the info about Wsgi ( http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracModWSGI
)but i dont't understand well all info.

"It is already possible to run Trac on top of mod_wsgi. This can be
done by writing the following application script.

import os

os.environ['TRAC_ENV'] = '/usr/local/trac/mysite'
os.environ['PYTHON_EGG_CACHE'] = '/usr/local/trac/mysite/eggs'

import trac.web.main
application = trac.web.main.dispatch_request"

What can i do exactly with this? If i understand well, i must put this
code in a file and then rename to .wsgi. But im not sure. Well, im not
sure of nothing.

Any help will be appreciated.

A lot of thanks.

That's right. Afterwards, use the path to that file in a
WSGIScriptAlias directive in your Apache configuration files. Be sure
to also read the instructions about using Trac on the mod_wsgi site
(should be linked from the TracModWSGI page).

Cheers,

Hi again and thank you to respond so fast.

I created a test.wsgi file with the code and saved to project trac
subfolder named apache:

/var/www/html/trac/apache/test.wsgi

Then i try to modify httpd.conf but when i restart apache returns me
an error. Perhaps i forgot something. The error:

Invalid command 'WSGIScriptAlias', perhaps mis-spelled or defined by a
module not included in the server configuration

Forgot i something?

Best Regards,

Ruben

Yep, that would be the case. For some reason, Apache doesn't yet know
about the WSGIScriptAlias, which means mod_wsgi isn't properly
installed.
