 
 
Tonight, 8 p.m.
 
 
It's the Sugar Bowl, where the University of Utah and the University of Alabama will face off, to prove once and for all which of us knows more about football.

Crimson & White, I've been waiting for this game for weeks. On the line, a new avatar of the winner's choice for a month.

I'll be watching, will you?

Yes, I think I'll cheer for Utah, just for the fact I want to see them go undefeated,,,and have a reason to want to claim the National Champ Title, but they can't because of the BCS....so maybe it will somehow get these fools to devise a playoff series in college football....

But, I think Alabama will win, they do have the rest of the union to help them along after all.......  
 
 
The game just started and Utah has already scored one touchdown and then intercepted 'Bama,,,there is still 10 minutes left in the first quarter!

Utah 14

Bama 0

8:37 left in the first quarter!
 
 
Anybody want to change their vote?

You must be giddy!

Did you graduate from Utah?
 
 
21-0 wow
 
 
This is un fucking believable.

HOLY SHIT~

You're still alive? Thought you would have jumped off a bridge or something by now!  
 
 
There is alot of football left. BAMA's defense has the ability to adjust. Utah better be able to do the same.

uh----you better get their asses pumped up --quick !

Right,,,,,,,right..................

Maybe...just maybe,,,,,they have a chance.

OR..is Utah for real? Will they be another contender to claim #1 if they win big tonight?

Don't drink TOO much tonight CW!

Why ?--Bama stops themselves with penalties--nice field goal tho !
 
 
This blows
 
 
Ugh! Missed FG. As a neutral I'd love to see Bama make a game of it, but.....it's not looking good.
 
 
 
This is un fucking believable.

 

For you, perhaps, but not for me. The Mountain West gets no respect, and the SEC is overrated.
 
 
What a return!!!!!
 
 
Oh man - I saw at least 3 missed tackles.
 
 
What is a crimson tide? Is that that horrible stuff in the ocean? And why are there elephants?

It makes your eyes burn, that's for sure.
 
 
This fuckin blows
 
 
Congrats Utah! Undefeated, you have a right to fight for #1!

Alabama, you have a wheel in the ditch, and a wheel on the track!

Sorry Crimson Tide, just go drink your sorrows away...............
 
 
Crimson, I'll be in touch with your new avatar.  

Good game.
 
 
 
Did you graduate from Utah?

 

No, but I lived there from age 22 to age 33. And, went to a shit ton of Utah games. Also, for any non-Moron, there is an intense loyalty to the U of U since they are NOT BYU.

Well, Utah and Rick Majerus won me some money back when he took them to the Final 4 in 1998,,,,  

(they lost to the hated Kentucky Wildcats   )

Man, your teams are having a great year!

Now, please tell me you're a Colts fan,   you've got some mojo going for your teams it seems............
 
 
Three things happened in football today that absolutely blew my mind: 1) Ole Miss upsets Texas Tech, I cried; 2) Alabama loses to Utah, I laughed; 3) Peyton Manning won MVP, I said, "WTF?"

Peyton Manning is overrated and does NOT deserve MVP by any stretch of the imagination this year.

Damn, why you hating jsanders?

Shall I post some stats for you?
 
 
Holy shit. What the hell was that? Was that a football game? It looked more like a slaughtering to me. Poor CW. I'm a bit of a 'Nole fan, so I know how you feel. In the words of Bubba... "I feel your pain."

His stats are outstanding, but he has a good team behind him. I just don't like the Mannings. I never liked Archie, I never liked either of his retarded looking children, and I won't like any of their kids either. Sorry. I can't stand athletes that feel the need to flaunt their abilities and show their face on every outlet of media every chance they get. Peyton is paid more than enough money by the Colts, he doesn't need to make money by endorsing every product under the sun.
 
 
 Peyton Manning Children's Hospital 
 
 
So he's charitable? Big deal. I never said he was a bad person. I still can't stand him.

And which bowl game did Arkansas play in again?
 
 
How long was the avatar bet for again? Can't remember if it was a week or a month. Good game Utah. This one is hard to swallow. Bama didn't even show up.

Don't cry to me. Arkansas wasn't 12-1 playing against an unknown team. I'm okay with the fact Arkansas finished this season 6-6, it's far better than I expected given the team Houston Nutt left us with. I'm satisfied with our season. We went out beating our biggest rival for the second year in a row, not losing to the Utah Utes.

And yet Arkansas still sucks. Always have and probably always will.

If the Hogs had faced the Utes or the Tide, all that would have been left of the Hogs would have been a greasy spot on the field, and the smell of bacon.

Always have? This is the first time in 6 years that we weren't ranked at some point in the season. We were making a national title run two years ago.

Considering we don't have the history Alabama has, I'll accept that. Alabama's always been a football power house, it's easy to root for a team like that. But every time we beat teams like you (which happens a lot), we get more enjoyment out of the humiliation it brings you than we do out of the actual win.

Also, considering Alabama had a spectacular year in a year when the SEC was a joke, I wouldn't get too cocky. In a couple of years, the SEC West is going to be a giant clusterfuck, much in the same way the Big 12 South was this year. Arkansas's rebuilding, Ole Miss is rebuilding, Auburn will rebuild, LSU will rebuild, and hell, even Mississippi St. could rebuild. Enjoy the time you have at the top, it won't last long.

No shit. We sucked this year.

You're lucky. If I won a bet like that, instead of making you carry my team's logo, I'd make you carry a logo of your team being desecrated.

I really wish I had bet on the Colts game, so I could make someone carry an avatar of Manning getting owned.

Don't hate. Appreciate.  

Seriously, you're just mad at me because I laughed at Alabama's getting owned. If you recall, I too said Utah didn't have a chance in hell. I should be just as embarrassed as you, but then again, I wasn't carrying around the Alabama emblem.

No sense rubbing his face in it. The loss was humiliating enough for Alabama after all the trash talking they'd done.

That's something you may learn as you get older...to be gracious in both victory and defeat. Crimson is there, you aren't, yet.

Utah showed showed up. They are very well coached and that QB is very talented. Their defense is quick and my boys from Tuscaloosa overlooked them. We got beat. Congrats.

As for sanders, I do have a question. How does one become proud of mediocrity?
 
 
Bless your heart CW. I never have a problem rooting for the 'Tide, unless they're playing my Sooners.

Good game, Utah. You did well. Congrats on an unblemished season.

BOOMER SOONER!
 
 
Would you like to join me in a few rounds to drown our sorrows about our teams losing this weekend?  

 
 
 
I'm guessing from your new signature, EZ, that you ALSO lost a bet this weekend?

BTW, my boyfriend told me that my bet with CW over avatars was perhaps the dorkiest thing he'd ever seen me do. He clearly fails to recognize the importance of a visual representation of yourself online.

Yes, I made a bet with Toro, not sure if I did with anyone else!

I agree these bets are dorky, but it saves me a ton of money in real life!

Serve it up. Just keep in mind, when I'm drunk, I'm easy to take advantage of.

Oh, when my team loses, I accept it. When someone else's team loses, I rub it in. That's the fun of the sport.

For instance...

Hey EZ, what do you call 50 guys sitting at home watching the Super Bo...

Nah, I won't go there.
