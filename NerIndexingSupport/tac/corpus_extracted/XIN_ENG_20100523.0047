A Philippine military official said here Sunday the government would continue
its efforts to greatly diminish the strength of leftist New People's Army to
make the NPA 's end imminent, even if the total defeat of the NPA's Army can't
be achieved by the end of June.

"The NPA of today will not be able to survive long because of the effective
military operations and the comprehensive government approach to defeating
insurgency," said Francisco Cruz, Civil Relations Service chief of the Armed
Forces of the Philippines ( AFP).

Through the government's well-crafted and well-executed counter- insurgency
campaign, Cruz said, the NPA's strength as of year-end 2009 was reduced to only
153 in northern Philippines and 126 in the country's southrern part.

In the provinces of Biliran, Siquijor, Guimaras, Romblon, Marinduque, Cavite,
Ifugao, Apayao, La Union, Pangasinan, and Ilocos Norte, the NPA presence is
virtually nil, he said.

The NPA, one of the major anti-government forces in the Philippines, has been
waging a guerrilla campaign in the countryside for four decades. Military
estimates the NPA strength at about 5,000 men scattered in more than 60
guerrilla fronts throughout the country.

The military promised to solve the leftist insurgency problem before current
Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo ends her term of officer on June 30
this year.
