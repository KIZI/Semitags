 
 
Which are your favorite teams?
 
 
Vote and discuss.
 
 
I can't quite place it, but I detect some kind of slant in that poll...
 
 
Obviously a poll set up by someone not from Pittsburgh!

 
 
 
 
This is my favorite team:

The Denver Roller Dolls!
 
 
Am I the only sports fan here?

C'MON MEN!!! LET'S VOTE!!!
 
 
Watching sports sucks, dude. I'd rather go play them. I can't stand the crazy fuckin' Broncos fans who come to work Monday or Tuesday totally depressed cause the Broncos lost. Or who are elated when the Broncos win. I mean, c'mon! The Broncos won, not you! Wake up! You're not even on the team!

C'MON MEN!!! LET'S VOTE!!!

 

You may be the only Boston/New England fan here!

What about college football and basketball? Do my beloved Ohio State University Buckeyes count?
 
 
Hmmm... any team not from Boston.

I don't think so!!!          

Based on the poll results, it looks like I am the only sports fan here!

WHERE ARE ALL THE MEN???
 
 
Houston Astros
Dallas Cowboys
San Antonio Spurs

The Patriots are from Foxboro...do you like them?
 
 
I LOVE to root against the Red Sux!  

I enjoyed watching Buffalo put the fear of God into The PATS!   (That is, I enjoyed it right up until the PATS pulled off an impressive [albeit lucky-break] come-back).

I TOTALLY enjoyed watching the JETS crush the PATS last week. The Brady Bunch just couldn't stand up to the heat.  

I'm sorry; what was the question again?

No problem...the question was "Why does Liability suck so much?"

No problem at all. I see you got distracted. I went back to find the original question. That wasn't it.

And I don't suck. You seem to be engaging in a twisted daydream. Snap out of it.

The original question evolved.
 
 
I can see that a REAL MAN has joined me in voting in the poll...
 
 
What about the NHL, Boston? The Stanley Cup sits in Pittsburgh today.

I don't know what you are talking about.
 
 
Note that the Bruins are conspicuously absent from the poll. They are dead to me.

(until they suck me back in again)
 
 
Have to be the Spurs.....Let's keep doing it guys!!!
 
 
What?

No Boston Bruins?
 
 
I really dislike the cheating Patriots so I'll vote for whoever is playing against them!

For the longest time after the Cards left St. Louis I was a big Dolphis fan. Stable ownership and coaching, that type of thing. Also like the Chiefs and the Packers.

Baseball is a weird sport, no salary cap. I find myself rooting against the Yankees.

Hockey, Detroit has my admiration but I really root for the hometown Blues.
 
 
Baseball: the Brooklyn Dodgers, New York Giants, Boston Braves, and Philadelphia Athletics.

Football: Cleveland Rams, Chicago Cardinals, Baltimore Colts.
 
 
Cool poll - no football teams, and no teams from outside the US!
 
 
Lets rename the poll...Who is your favorite Boston team?

There are the Steelers, and there are the wannabes.

I was thinking the same thing.  
 
 
is this a poll for liking teams that get knocked out of the playoffs early?

BEST POST EVER!

 
 
 
I like the Washington Redskins, the Philadelphia Phillies, NASCAR and NHRA Drag Racing. All of the other sports teams are just "players"...
