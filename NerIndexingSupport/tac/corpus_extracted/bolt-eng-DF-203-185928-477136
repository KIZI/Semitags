Did anyone else hear this?? If its true it just proves my theory that the wrong people seem to get pregnant.... No offence if anyone loves her.

Good Lord I hope this is not true! I saw her in front of the fire house where they are filming at the moment and her skirt didn't even cover her a$$!
 
 
Noooooo...
surely this is just a rumor. Because that would ruin the "image" she has created for herself.
I mean, she wants to be trashy, party animal, ass baring, fist fighting reality tv star. Being a loving, responsible mother would ruin that for her.
 
 
This rumor was going around a few weeks back, maybe January and I saw where she denied it and then got mad bc she thought people were calling her fat. So hopefully that is the case. Because god help that poor child.
 
 
This rumor floats around every few months. I would be extremely surprised if it were true.
 
 
I doubt she is. She wants kids when she's married she has said before. But, her and JWoww just started a reality show and she didn't appear pregnant. A few months ago she was accused of pregnancy and she said again that when she's married she'd like to have children.
 
 
People is reporting it also.

this makes it seem more legit.

It does. What a mess.
 
 
Yeah, People only reports after rep confirmation, usually. That's why they are never sued.

Ick.
 
 
It'd be crazy if she is. I'd think she'd be the type to stop partying and become a typical person and be focused on being a mom. Hopefully at least. :) Sort of like Nicole Richie.
 
 
It's on people but I'm still hoping it's not true. I hope it's a rumour for publicity.
That poor, poor child.
 
 
Looks like her rep said "no comment". If she weren't I'm thinking it would have been a denial....unless he hasn't talked to her yet? I'm grasping at straws here, for the child's sake....
 
 
I'm not going to lie, I would totally tune into a reality show with Snooki and a baby. Hopefully she can afford a nanny to raise the kid.
 
 
DISGUSTED
and agreeing with PP that said the wrong people get pregnant.
Her and Gianni (sp) are TOXIC. THere is nothing funny about bringing a child into that relationship. Honestly she is not remotely capable of being a mother -a nd someone else is going to wind up raising that kid.
Not to mention I am selfishly upset that I think she just sealed the deal on the fate of Jersey Shore.
 
 
I read an article about it that began: "The collective IQ of the Universe is about to drop....."

LOL-Fox's headline said something like "every bartender in the JS are going out of business".

Can you say fetal alcohol syndrome?
 
 
When it is on TMZ, I believe it.

I agree with you on your point about being selfishly annoyed that her pregnancy probably ends Jersey Shore. Although, she can probably afford to hire a nanny while her and Jionni party at the shore... I kid, I kid.
I think your comment about how "the wrong people get pregnant" and how terrible of a mom she's going to be are silly. Maybe she'll grow up now and be a great mom. She gets paid to party with her friends. I think most 20somethings would jump at that opportunity.
 
 
Meh. There are far worse people who procreate.

I agree....she gets paid to party and drink and the more you watch, the more she gets paid.....who's to say she won't turn her life around and be a great mom. Am I a fan, no, but come on, cut the girl some slack.
 
 
I heard that she confirmed it and that said that she denied the original rumors because she didn't want to jinx the pregnancy. The new show is suppose to be about them transitioning to the real world after JS, the boyfriends live in the house with them
 
 
Jersey Shore was ending anyway. This isn't going to end it. Several of them are already working on spin-offs.
This could be pure gold for MTV though. Combining their two biggest money-making shows: Guidos + people having kids that probably shouldn't.
