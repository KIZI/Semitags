Lebanese President Michel Suleiman praised on Wednesday the achievements of the
Internal Security Forces (ISF) about uncovering Israeli-linked spy networks,
local Naharnet website reported.

The president visited the headquarters of the ISF in Beirut Wednesday and
congratulated the security forces on the achievement of arresting spies working
for the Israeli intelligence service Mossad.

However, police chief Gen. Asraf Rifi said Tuesday that more arrests will take
place, stressing that "there are files under preparations for more arrests to
complete the mission."

The series of arrests started last April when the Lebanese intelligence detected
a suspected communication route which led to the arrest of a former ISF high
ranking officer Gen. Adib al- Alam along with his wife and nephew who were
working with him.

Over 35 suspects are under arrest, many have confessed to be spying for Israel
and among those arrested last week are two senior Lebanese army officers, while
at least five ISF members are arrested as well.

The spies are accused of collecting information on Hezbollah locations and
monitoring of their leaders' moves, as well as the involvement in the
assassinations of Hezbollah commander Ghaleb Awali in 2004 who was killed by a
bomb in the southern suburbs of Beirut.
