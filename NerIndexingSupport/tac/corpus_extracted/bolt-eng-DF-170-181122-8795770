So about an hour ago, I heard on CNBC that a large plane was circling Manhattan escorted by Fighter jets. Of course any normal reaction was that scared the shit out of me.

Apparently I wasn't the only one.

WTF is wrong with these people? You DO NOT have fucking fighter jets trailing a large commercial jet that's like a 747 with quad engines over Manhattan without giving us massive warning notices. The unjust panic this caused today in lower Manhattan should really be investigated.

A fucking photo-op???

A plane circling Lower Manhattan escorted by two fighter jets is part of a photo op, said Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Jim Peters. The event caused some evacuations of office buildings in Lower Manhattan and Jersey City, N.J., on Monday morning.

Mr. Peters said the Defense Department is conducting a photo op that involves deploying two F-16s and escorting a Boeing 747 in the vicinity of Lower Manhattan and the Statue of Liberty. He said the maneuver is not an emergency and was coordinated in advance with the FAA and state and local officials.

Theyll do two or three spins and be done by 10:30, Mr. Peters said.

Kevin Chin, a 25-year-old IT analyst with UBS working in Jersey City, N.J. was in the building when his coworker Yumi Nishiyama snapped this picture (above) around 9:40 a.m. on her iPhone. We didnt know what was going on until later on, said Chin, who did not evacuate the building.

Fucking idiots. WHO THE HELL DOES THIS??

That's messed up. They should have made sure every media outlet anywhere near NYC started distributing this info DAYS in advance.

I'd have headed for the ground, that's for damned sure.

That's a 747 at least. I can't believe how stupid these people are.
 
 
There's a rumor flying around that it was a Photo-op of Air Force 1 flying by the Statue of Liberty to celebrate 100 days.  
 
 
Dumb.

I think even a few in the Obama-media would shake their heads over this...
 
 
wait a minute, i thought all liberals didnt believe there was an actual terrorist threat?
why would you panic about this is you dont believe its possible?
 
 
 
There's a rumor flying around that it was a Photo-op of Air Force 1 flying by the Statue of Liberty to celebrate 100 days.  

 

I was just about to say this was probably some Obama/Hillary Clinton photo-op crap. I can't believe they would be that stupid. On second thought, yes they would.

If this was a photo-op, not only is it a huge waste of resources during an economic recession, but a logistic cluster fu-k as well to have a low flying plain over Manhattan with fighter jets trailing it...

Good lord what a PR mess that would be.

Even liberal New Yorkers would be giving Obama the finger over this if in fact it is true his administration was behind it.
 
 
A photo op?

What a grand idea, the city that was hit by terrorist flown jetliners has a jetliner trailed by interceptors so someone can take pictures.

Do any of these people have IQs higher then an endtable?

Obama was out for a joyride; it was Air Force One.
 
 
It will be interesting to see what the decaying MSM does with this vis a vis our newly minted homeland security rocket scientist. Not much would be my guess. But if that guess is wrong The Prophet takes another step in the wrong direction.
 
 
Drudge has a report on it.

It was an Air Force One photo op.

And frankly - this is idiotic. If it is actually part of some 100-day advertising stint - it is deplorable.

It is quite remarkable to see the media-generated frenzy being created by Obama having reached the 100-day mark.

And yet, within this frenzy, nary a true look at just what this new president has actually accomplished?
 
 
Silence is golden innit?            
 
 
Ellen in Bayonne, N.J. described what she saw to WCBSTV.com: "I saw the jet flying very very low over the Hudson river, it looked like it was going to fly through our office window. Then it banked sharply toward New Jersey. But our building was evacuated because it did this 3 times. A photo shoot should have been communicated to the building in the area. We haven't forgotten 9/11, people were in a panic, lots of rumors, not a good situation."

Good lord this administration of amatuers is astounding in its repeated lack of tact, consideration, or even recent historical perspective.

Perhaps because they don't view the attacks on 9-11 as serious, they were so idiotic in conducting such a ridiculous publicity stunt without communicating to the very people who went through 9-11.

I have said it before, and I shall say it yet again:

Obama is stupid.
 
 
BO was behind it!

That sonofabitch, he really does have his head up his ass.

My god watching that video sent chills - I can only imagine what New Yorkers were thinking.

This idiotic stunt should be THE LEADING STORY in today's news.

This administration must be held to account for this disgusting waste of tax payer dollars, and incredibly insensitive and blatant offront to New Yorkers - and all Americans who still remember the impact of 9-11.
 
 
nice going obama....

Stocks fell in New York trading after the plane was sighted at about 10 a.m. The Standard & Poors 500 Index lost about 0.7 percent over 10 minutes, then recouped all of the loss by 10:20 a.m.

Lemmie tell ya' something here - whatever the backstory is here, I want to find out. There is something called the Freedom of Information Act and I do have the right to know why the fucking hell they decided to take a backup plane for Air Force 1 and do some kind of photo op for it. I am STILL fucking pissed off right now.

Fucking idiots. WHO THE HELL DOES THIS??

 

Obama was out for a joyride; it was Air Force One.

 

Nossir. It was a back up of Air Force One. Obama was busy giving a speech at the National Academy of Sciences at the time. We know this because Drudge posted that Obama was yelling at the teleprompter.

We have no idea if this was BO or not. I just posted a rumor. All I know is that it was some kind of photo op. For who - I have no idea. Could be for 24 - because 24 is set in NYC for Season 8 next year. If this was Obama's doing, he better have a good fucking explanation for scaring the shit out of me and tens of thousands of other people.
 
 
Maybe he ran out of gas and was going to land in the river?
 
 
the buck stops with obama...

how does that plane get out without obama's approval? that is airforce one when he is flying on it...does this mean that it is so easy to simply order that plane with a fighter jet escort over NY....to get the FAA to ok it....

if obama didn't expressly ok it, then he is a lousy CIC that has no control over his airplanes

I wouldn't care if it was a Cessna. You don't get a 2-fighter escort from the USAF for nothing.

It most certainly is a passenger airliner though.

actully they are not called airforce 1 unless the pres is on the plane....so no matter which plane he is on it is air force one.....

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force_One 

Air Force One is the air traffic control call sign of any United States Air Force aircraft carrying the President of the United States.[1] Since 1990, the presidential fleet has consisted of two specifically configured, highly customized Boeing 747-200B series aircraft – tail codes Special Air Mission (SAM) "28000" and SAM "29000" – with Air Force designation "VC-25A". While these aircraft are referred to as "Air Force One" only while the president is on board
 
 
 Plane stupid: Mayor Bloomberg outraged over military photo-op involving low-flying presidential jet 

"
The NYPD confirmed that it had been told of the Pentagon's "aerial photo mission" last Thursday but ordered to stay quiet about it.

Sen. Chuck Schumer called the whole incident "absolutely outrageous and appalling."
"To think that the FAA would plan such a photo shoot and not warn the public, knowing full well that New Yorkers still have the vivid memory of 9/11 etched in their minds," he said. [/QUOTE]

Once again - this had nothing to do with Obama. This was DoD.
 
 
Oh now--com-on guys--he was probably just waving to his loyal subjects down below. And to be certain--Obama will show up at those hospitals where the coronaries are from this incident.

BTW--I guess so much for EARTH DAY!

It was not Air Force 1. It was Air Force 1's backup.

 

yes, and it becomes air force one when the president is on board...it is one of the planes he uses, it is one of the presidential planes...how is it that a presidential plane gets out for a photo op and obama is clueless....

not necessarily you, but i find it ironic how the libs don't believe bush could not have known about 9/11 before hand....but readily accept that obama "loses" one of the presidential planes that flies in a manner just like 9/11....
 
 
 
 
 
the buck stops with obama...

how does that plane get out without obama's approval? that is airforce one when he is flying on it...does this mean that it is so easy to simply order that plane with a fighter jet escort over NY....to get the FAA to ok it....

if obama didn't expressly ok it, then he is a lousy CIC that has no control over his airplanes

 

It was not Air Force 1. It was Air Force 1's backup.

"Loses?" Someone has already taken responsibility...put down the crack pipe.

Next you'll be telling us Obama was dropping pictures of torture victims over Manhattan in a plot to discredit the Bush administration.

 Plane stupid: Mayor Bloomberg outraged over military photo-op involving low-flying presidential jet 

"
The NYPD confirmed that it had been told of the Pentagon's "aerial photo mission" last Thursday but ordered to stay quiet about it.

Sen. Chuck Schumer called the whole incident "absolutely outrageous and appalling."
"To think that the FAA would plan such a photo shoot and not warn the public, knowing full well that New Yorkers still have the vivid memory of 9/11 etched in their minds," he said.

 

Once again - this had nothing to do with Obama. This was DoD.[/QUOTE]

DITTO--With the Obama administration--EVERYTHING is always someone else's fault.

If the defense department WAS NOT NOTIFIED--what were those 3 F-16's fighter jets doing there "escorting" Air Force One?

1. Were they planning on shooting Air Force One down? OR
2. Were they notified of the low fly over?

According to the Obama administrations statement--if it to be believed--we would have to assume they were there to shoot it down? he.he.he.

Everyday--it just gets better!  
 
 
At least they issued an apology:

 
The White House later issued a profuse apology over the incident.

I think that plane burns at least 5 gallons of gas to a mile, you think it would be a little smarter to send up a helicopter that would not have scared the Be-Jesus out of everyone and it certainly would have used less gas. Go Green!!!! Geeee, I wonder whose decision that was????
 
 
obama is the CIC....and he said the buck stops with him...i am amazed that such a stunt could happen and obama is totally clueless...or is he...

So this "PHOTO-OP MISSION" came directly from the White House.

Anyone care to persist in stating this is not Obama's fault?

And just what was the purpose of this photo-op mission?

How much of our tax dollars were spent for this? To say nothing of the poor environment!

I'm with those who are absolutely pissed off over this. What an incredibly insensitive gesture from the White House...
 
 
O.K., so now the FAA was supposed to notify Mayor Bloomberg about the low flying--Air Force 1 with 3-F-16's in tow. So then, how was Mayor Bloomberg going to notify everyone in lower Manhattan?

Was Bloomberg to Install radio speakers on cars--running around Manhattan --STATING: Important notice--today at 2:15 P.M you will hear a large plan flying low & out of the regular designated FAA path with 3-jet fighters in tow--not to worry it is your President on the campaign trail again--looking for a new photo opportunity----he.he.he.

BTW--So much for EARTH DAY!

Every day with Obama in office is another day of sheer entertainment.

White House Apologizes for Not Warning of 'Aerial Photo Mission'

NEW YORK, April 27 -- A plane used as a backup for Air Force One and a fighter jet escort swooped low in the sky over New York Monday morning as part of a government photo-op, panicking workers, forcing evacuations and prompting an outcry from lawmakers.

The White House later issued a profuse apology over the incident.

The flyover -- involving a 747 that is one of two used by the president and an Air Force F-16 fighter jet -- took place in Lower Manhattan's financial district and caused traders, construction workers and others to flee for safety. An Air Force spokeswoman said the "aerial photo mission" was authorized to take place in Lower Manhattan and New Jersey and was to last 30 minutes.

The New York Police Department said in a statement that the flight was authorized by the Federal Aviation Administration "for the vicinity of the Statue of Liberty." It added that "local authorities" had been told not to disclose information about it and to direct inquiries to the FAA.

The FAA did not return calls for comment, but a spokesman there was quoted earlier today by news agencies as saying local authorities were made aware of the flight before it took place.

The flyover infuriated New York lawmakers, who said they were not notified in advance and lashed out at federal authorities. The Air Force referred calls to the White House, but White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, when questioned about the matter at his daily briefing, said he was unaware of the photo mission.

Louis Caldera, director of the White House Military Office, subsequently said in a statement that he approved the mission last week....

Exactly.

What a terrible blunder this is - a testament to a White House still way over their heads.

It would appear 9-11 means so little to them that they would not carefully consider timely, full and open disclosure to the very residents of New York who suffered through that most terrible of days.

Idiots.
 
 
I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH OBAMA'S DENIAL THAT HE KNEW ANYTHING: Maybe some of you can help.

A couple of months ago I watched a special on Air Force One. It was mostly about how things were organized when President Bush made his surprise visit to Iraq--on Thankgiving day.

I seem to remember a statement made then--that THE PILOTS OF AIR FORCE ONE--& there are two AIR FORCE ONE'S can only take their ORDERS directly from the President of the United States.

Directly after 9/11 -- The FAA flight plans were changed to keep away from sky-scrapers. This low fly-over VIOLATED those FAA flight regulations.

"What an Obamanation"!
 
 
now that we know it was the whitehouse....liberals and the dem senators who earlier expressed outrage will be absolutely mum....

i think davids' rumor that this is a photo op celebrating obama's first 100 days is accurate...the timing is to coincidental...

another obama god complex...or is it as someone suggested him giving the silent finger again like he did during the campaigns....

nice going obama....

Stocks fell in New York trading after the plane was sighted at about 10 a.m. The Standard & Poors 500 Index lost about 0.7 percent over 10 minutes, then recouped all of the loss by 10:20 a.m.

How can this ever have an excuse? Obamaphiles -- How does this pass muster with you? Had it happened under Boooosh, we would never have heard the end of it. Where's the outrage?

WASHINGTON – An administration official says a presidential Boeing 747 and a fighter jet flew low near ground zero in New York City Monday because the White House Military Office wanted to update its file photo of the president's plane near the Statue of Liberty.

This official said the White House Military Office told the Federal Aviation Administration that it periodically updates file photos of Air Force One near national landmarks, like the statute in New York harbor and the Grand Canyon.

The official requested anonymity to give more details than the official White House announcement that took the blame.

The incident on Monday caused a brief panic among workers, who weren't warned. They recalled the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.

 

Again - not Obama's fault - but whoever planned this and said NOT to alert NYC residents or decided NOT to do this with fucking Photoshop or over the Grand Canyon is absolutely the biggest fucking moron I have ever heard of in my lifetime. This guy's head BETTER be on a fucking silver platter by the end of the week.

You're not using your melon, and just buying their BULLSHIT line. THINK -- This NEVER HAPPENED under Bush! Where were the "periodic" AF1 updates the last eight fucking years?

Fucking apologist idiot!

I want to know who knew what and when, and where the buck stops. What IDIOT originally came up with the moronic idea of, "Hey dudes, this will be really cool Man, like, let's buzz the WTC with a 747 and a coupla fighter jets dude, and let's not tell the Mayor or anyone else dude..."

At what point does Obama have to take responsibility for some of this shit, from you apologists?

I like how Jillian suddenly disappeared when it was proven to be a photo op.

But more importantly, what in the hell were they thinking? I boggles my mind that a group of people, from the MILITARY Laison office thought this would be a good idea.

And not to be a blamer but...who does the head of that office answer to? Who does he clear his ideas with? Rahm? BO? Someone higher up than him knew what they were planning.

Someone should have said...."this isn't a good idea."

Not even. Bush was given a couple of years of slack...until most of us saw footage in Iraq with no WMD in sight. You asses have been melting down since 1/20. And over the most idiotic things. Keep up the good work...

 

again, you moron, no one is melting down but YOU
you really need to learn what sarcasm is
 
 
its always easier for the conservative to pretend to be a lib
but libs can NEVER get away with pretending to be conservatives

you calling me a wingnut shows how fucking clueless you are
 
 
 
 
 
Please go back through my entire posting history you fucking moron and show me where I have blamed Bush for everything.

Someone in The PENTAGON made a decision to update their file photo of Air Force 1 near the statue of Liberty. NOT OBAMA. Now, I'm sure Gates had to have knowledge of this since they were using F-16s. So GATES should have to answer for this. Obama kept Gates on to help us with the strategy in Iraq and Afghanistan - not for this bullshit.

 

you blame bush all the time for stuff...get real...

 

Can you show me an instance in where I blamed Bush for something that he had no control over? Come on, show me, fucker. I know my posts and my political opinions a LOT better than you do. And you're going to come on here and try to tell me that YOUR PATHETIC LITTLE ASS does? Just do us all a favor and STFU.

 

Who asked that. Why are you avoiding #85? Ah yeah, bad deal for you on this post. Thought you could blame DOD, when in fact, it was President Obama's staff. Not the fucking military.
 
 
 
This is just like the pirate thing...you all expect Obama to micromanage things...if he doesn't you pee your pants. If he does, you pee your pants. Hence...stock up on depends.

And when you aren't peeing your pants you are busy advocating sadism as an American value.

It's really fucking funny.

 

i supported obama dealing with the pirates....and ravi, this is america, it happened under his watch and it was his airplane...stop beign such a partisan hack

you call this idiotic???? the mayor, who supported obama is ticked, the democratic senators from ny are ticked and fuming, davids was livid....

but lo and behold it now is obama's fault and people are no longer angry

obama's followers are laughing stock

ravi shows over and over how much of a moron she is
 
 
just imagine the headlines and the rage right now if this had been under bush's administration
 
 
 
now that we know it was the whitehouse....liberals and the dem senators who earlier expressed outrage will be absolutely mum....

i think davids' rumor that this is a photo op celebrating obama's first 100 days is accurate...the timing is to coincidental...

another obama god complex...or is it as someone suggested him giving the silent finger again like he did during the campaigns....

 

This administration is so obsessed with marketing The Prophet,...well, fill in the blanks
 
 
and ravi thinks this is no big deal....

 
When President Obama learned of the episode on Monday afternoon, aides said, he, too, was furious. Senior administration officials conveyed the presidents anger in a meeting with Mr. Caldera on Monday afternoon.

 

her messiah is furious

1. i can't believe he didn't know about this
2. inept CIC leadership
3. he lied when he said the buck stops with him
4. when anyone in bush's admin was responsible, dems of course blamed bush as president, but obama, nah, he gets to blame others

Bush wasn't responsible for Katrina - Bush was partially responsible for not acting soon enough and organized enough in a response to Katrina. FEMA is the most inept government organization that there has ever been. Parts of NO have STILL not been re-built. God forbid we have a major earthquake in SF or LA - those cities will NEVER recover until we replace FEMA.

Abu Ghraib - the soldiers there were acting on orders handed down from the SecDef, Rumsfeld himself. Instead of Rumsfeld acting like a conservative would act, taking responsibility for his own actions and turning himself in, he let low ranking soldiers who were just following orders take the fall.

If Obama himself ordered the FAA to do the flyover today, I would ask for Obama's resignation. But Obama had nothing to do with this. You just think you're playing the same game the lefties played in the past 8 years when everything that went wrong was Bush's fault. So because they were really annoying and idiots for 8 years, you can be one too? Is that your strategy? Good luck with that...

do you have any proof obama had nothing to do with this? see, obama said the buck stops with him...now, you are making him a liar. he can't even control his own airplanes....what an inept CIC...it happened under his watch...you blame bush for 9/11...but obama gets a pass when his own planes do the fly over of new york...unbelievable

and look at you generalizing cons in your post....lool, hack
 
 
People, people...please! Have you ever heard of a fire drill or a tornado drill? When they pulled the lever, the little kids were not notified in advance. This is the same thing...a terrorist drill. Geez!
 
 
President Obama has given the Saturday Night live comedy show enough material to keep them busy for the next 3 1/2 years if he were to stop with everything today, they would still have us laughing in 3 1/2 years. They can't keep up with him and his administration. They need to do the show on a daily basis just to stay on top of him, thing is that might not be enough.

810 billion dollar stimulus bill that no one read before they signed. Boy, that's real transperancy there. Full of pork, will do little to create jobs. Fish barrier removal projects and 30 million to study a mouse out in San Francisco. bonuses that Chris Dodd wrote in it for failed AIG execs.

410 billion dollar omnibus bill that had 9,000 earmarks, one of which studies why pigs stink. Keep in mind that Bush refused to sign it because of these earmarks so the democratic congress held it over for Obama. Didn't he say that he would not sign anything with earmarks????

3.7 Trillion dollar budget that his own congressional budget office has stated is unsustainable.

100 million that he is ordering congress to cut from this budget which amounts to a 1/2 drip of water in a 5 gallon bucket.

Releasing classified documents of interogation techniques against the advise of 4 former CIA directors including his current one. Caving to the ACLU and Move on Dot. org. This is the transperancy that our country needs, giving classified information to our enemies. Can anybody say Jimmy Carter 2 ?????

Now his administration buzzing the city of Manhattan in Air Force one to take a picture of the Statue of Liberty at tax payer's expense and scaring the be-jesus out of everyone.

I hope that you all got to see that bull running loose in the grocery store, I am sure it's on the web, but that's my opinion of his first 100 days.

Oh, the OUTRAGE by the RWN Obama haters was set to "High and WILD" by this event.
A few more OUTRAGE episodes like this and you RWers will be
worn out. Spent.
Exhausted.

Better get you some OUTRAGE Viagra from one of your RWN websites,
to keep your wild excited Obama hating far fetched assumptions and crazy ravings
up to Peak Performance.
Remember, consult with your doctor if your OUTRAGE lasts more than 4 hours
or if you pass out from too much loonytoons OUTRAGING.

Don't you see -
It is a plot to wear you guys down, to check your responses, and to tire you out.
FOX News was right.
You react to the stimulai as predictably as Pavlov's dogs,
everytime.
 
 
Obama should fire the idiot that ordered this.

Not because it scared people in New York, but because it was an incredible waste of the taxpayer's money.

I saw Air Force One on the tarmac in New York.

Beautiful plane, magnificient!
 
 
 
 
 
 Source: White House was updating AF One file photo 

Again - not Obama's fault - but whoever planned this and said NOT to alert NYC residents or decided NOT to do this with fucking Photoshop or over the Grand Canyon is absolutely the biggest fucking moron I have ever heard of in my lifetime. This guy's head BETTER be on a fucking silver platter by the end of the week.

 

how is this not obama's fault? he is the CIC...the buck stops with him...amazing, you blame bush for every little concievable thing, but obama gets a pass that HIS presidential plane scares the crap out of manhattan, causes stocks to fall and massive panic....

you're an obama bot

 

Please go back through my entire posting history you fucking moron and show me where I have blamed Bush for everything.

Lovely fallacious absurdity... truly, you're gifted....

OK, so at some pendatic point, perhaps its true that you've not blamed BUSH FOR EVERYTHING... but ya do tend to excuse The Lord of the Idiots and as evidence of that I submit this immutable, incontestable PROOF:

 http://www.usmessageboard.com/curren...ml#post1183437 
 
 
 
 
 
If this was a photo-op, not only is it a huge waste of resources during an economic recession, but a logistic cluster fu-k as well to have a low flying plain over Manhattan with fighter jets trailing it...

Good lord what a PR mess that would be.

Even liberal New Yorkers would be giving Obama the finger over this if in fact it is true his administration was behind it.

 

why do you assume it's a "photo op"? just because someone spread a rumor?

oh righyt... cause you're a wingnut.

 

Uh....Jillian... the FAA said it was a Photo-op.

 

 

they hadn't said that at the time... and I was talking to the wingnut... who didn't need an ounce of proof before he started whining.

that said, it was pretty goofy.
 
 
Uhhhh... Jill.. it came out pretty quick (unconfirmed) and not too long after that (confirmed) that this indeed was a PR stunt..

But back on subject...

This is just another piece of evidence of how truly clueless Obama and his administration are... anyone with any lick of common sense should have realized that this was indeed a BAD idea... on SO many levels

are you claiming all those people running of their buildings did so because it was lunch time? what about the people they interviewed....

how is it bush gets blamed for 9/11...but obama's own presidential airplane does a flyover of new york, scares the crap of people, causes the market to dip....and he is not responsible...

thats rich
 
 
The swine flu caused the market to dip. Have we become so weak as a country that a plane flying by downtown NYC causes everyone to grab their binky?

I guess the terrorists have won.

Liebermann is a liberal who happens to care more about what Isreal wants than what America wants. Spector is a conservative who is anti Iraq, right?

Conservatives have a lot of good ideas. We could use some conservatives in the Democratic party. Who knew the Republicans had a conservative in their party. I didn't.

You are wrong Ravi, this caused a major panic in lower Manhatten and on the Jersey Shore.

NY mayor Bloomberg said 'furious' was too soft a word for how he felt about it.

This was a major mistake by the DoD.

First problem is you have a civilian appointee as director of the White House Military Office. I know, I know..he used to be secretary of the Army...but he is a civilian. Every other director has been an active duty military member.

Second problem is the FAA knew it would cause panic but decided to do it anyway. Then they threaten the NYPD, the Secret Service, the FBI and the mayor's office with federal sanctions if any of them lets the word out.

Caldera can pick up the phone and direct not just Air Force One's back up plane and the USAF to deploy jets for a photo op just like that? He didn't have to clear that with anyone?

Plush job.
 
 
The level of stupidity of this is amazing. I laughed out loud at the idiocy of this when I first read it.
 
 
Boys and girls, from right and left, seems all of us are bright enough to get the point of photo op. This wasn't DOD, this was the party in power, read: Obama folk. They are making a video, might have been for 100 days, might have been for 2010, who knows? Was a screw up.
 
 
Apparently most of you don't watch the news very much.

Obama didn't find out about it until it was done.

It was one of his secretaries that did it, and thought it would be a good photo op. Obama said it would never happen again.

I'd personally like to see that hispanic motherfuckers nuts placed on a chopping block and pounded to dust. The douchebag's name is Louis E. Caldera.

If Obama keeps this idiot on in his cabinet, he's a fucking moron. I hope Caldera is fired by Friday.

He won't be. Rahm chewed his ass out. He is a political appointee by Obama. He's not going to fire him.

Besides, Obama apologized and said it would never happen again.

The masses are appeased.
 
 
I wasn't happy until Alberto Gonzalez left, and I won't be happy until Caldera is gone.

Maybe he will get hit by a bus.......there's always hope........would be nice for his family and friends to experience terror like what he put on NYC.

Personally? I'd like to see him in full traction in the hospital, with a 6 month coma. Hopefully it happens this week.
 
 
President Obama has asked for an internal investigation of a photo-op featuring the presidential jet that sent thousands of New Yorkers running for their lives -- and sent officials in Washington, D.C., running for political cover.

White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Tuesday Obama was "furious" when he heard about the incident and has ordered a deputy chief of staff of find out "why that decision was made and to ensure that it never happens again."

If he is so furious about this, why isn't he asking the questions.

Barack...please...listen to me. You don't need an internal investigation. You don't need a deputy chief of staff to ask questions.

This is what you do. You call Caldera to your office. Just you and him. Then you look at him - directly into his eyes and you say, "What the fuck were you thinking?" Then when he starts to answer you tell him, "No..be quiet. There is no correct answer to that question. Look, I like you. That is why I appointed you to this position. I broke all kind of protocol with you. First one who wasn't an active duty military member. But I promise you, you do something like this again, and you will never serve in the government again. Do you get it?"

Problem solved. No investigation. No drama. Just you and him.

You give him that kind of chewing out and he will be afraid to even pass gas.

Get some cojones Mr. President. You can do this. You don't have to everybody love you.
 
 
 
 
The swine flu caused the market to dip. Have we become so weak as a country that a plane flying by downtown NYC causes everyone to grab their binky?

I guess the terrorists have won.

 

You are wrong Ravi, this caused a major panic in lower Manhatten and on the Jersey Shore.

NY mayor Bloomberg said 'furious' was too soft a word for how he felt about it.

This was a major mistake by the DoD.

 

I think it was stupid but at the same time I don't think Obama had anything to do with it. I also have to wonder why after all this time we should treat New Yorkers like the mentally unstable.

And before you get on your high horse...even DavidS wasn't that upset when he started this thread. He originally titled the thread "Nevermind" and edited his post to say it was just a photo op...not exactly the reaction of someone that was panicked.

the problem wasnt the fly by so much as not informing the people well enough
 
 
Actually, it wasn't really a problem of informing the people either. The police, NYC FAA, as well as the mayor's office asked questions when they were told about it.

They were also told to keep it under their hats and not tell ANYONE about it.

So much for "clear and transparent government" eh?

bush is responsible for 9/11...but when obama's own airplanes do a flyover of new york and cause widespread panie obama is not at fault....

how can you possibly reconcile your partisan views? '

and ravi, face it, people were panicked, that is a fact, stopy denying it

Still wanna see Calderon in the hospital.........
 
 
How do we know Obammy wasn't on that plane taking a 306,000 dollar joy ride? Where was he when this was going on? Who was on that plane? Why take a picture of a wanna be Air Force 1 over a French piece of sculpture? Why not over the Capital, the White House or even more like Obammy...... the Lincoln Memorial? This made for TV movie of the week is pathetic, the idea that these clowns are in charge is scarier than a terrorist threat.

For a guy that is suppose to be the smartest President ever, he certainly doesn't know a lot. He didn't know about that imbecile Wright. He didn't know about Billy Ayres. He didn't know his wife has a huge ass. He didn't know Ted Kennedy is a drunk. He never suspected that the reason he got through Harvard was because he was a light skinned black guy and would look good to the alumni. He didn't know about Father Pfleger. And he didn't know that someone lifted the keys to his 400,000,000 dollar plane and took it for a joy ride. He didn't know George Soros was the bank behind his 715 million dollar campaign.

Sounds like a know nothing jerk, kinda like Hillary.

Hey! don't look at me I never accused him of being smart. never!  
 
 
With his utterly insensitive Air Force One photo op over NYC, it is worth taking stock of what our sophmoric narcissist POTUS has done, so far, to show he less concerned over maintaining the security of the homeland as he is over appealing to the far left of his party.

I am afraid his indifference will come back to haunt us all.

1.First day in office, outrages 9/11 victim families by suspending war crime trials against Guantanamo prisoners
Issues order to close Guantanamo, raising the possibility of their walking free

2.Newly minted Attorney General for US, Eric Holder, goes to European countries and tries to off load Guantanamo prisoners, further embarassing the US and raising concerns over its judgement and maturity

3.Orders release of CIA memos demonstrating tough interrogation tactics

4.His leader of homeland security, Napalitano, a former governor, identifies returning vets as potential terror threats while the Soros-backed far left demonstrations which he funds here and worldwide go without mention

5.Opens the door to prosecutions of Bush administration officials who fought the 9/11 terrorists as if it were a matter of law and order[/list]
I doubt this will be the last we hear from junior on this front. As they say in the Army, there is nothing more dangerous than a 2nd Lieutenant with a screwdriver.
 
 
Obama has done more for the terrorist than the terrorist could have hoped for from any member of their own team. LOL

Just out of curiosity, what color is the sky in your world?

The AF1 jet WAS being escorted by the F-16, because the F-16 was taking some of the pictures idiot.

You're probably also one of those conspiracy theorists who say that 9/11 was actually engineered by the White House as well, hunh?

Had no idea this thread was still going!

Here ya go:

Air force One buzzes New York, this cries out for a parody song. I chose "Jet Airliner" by the Steve Miller band:

Click to listen:  http://eipnetworks.com/jetairliner.mp3 

Flyin' low, over WTC
No damn idea what I'm doin
Ridin along in this big ol jet plane I been
thinkin bout whats wrong
These idiots think it's a good idea
to buzz the folks with air force one
I coulda tole 'em it's a bad idea
But ya know they'd fire me if I did

big ol jet airliner
Ya know they're getting carried away-ay
Woa-oh big ol jet airliner
Got no words for what to say

Photo op for the folks at home
Cuz Obama is trusted
But I'm tellin ya this just ain't the way
I hope to hell its not me that gets busted
Cuz my son could do this on photoshop
Instead of usin a real seven-four-seven
Ridin high I got tears in my eyes
You know the folks goin thru hell
as I fly thru the heavens

big ol jet airliner
Ya know they're getting carried away-ay
Woa-oh big ol jet airliner
Got no words for what to say

Panic scramble in New York Town
They think this plane's comin down
nine-eleven's still fresh in their minds
Ya know their heads just keep on spinnin around
And I did this with some trepidation
Cuz any idiot should surely see
That you don't just fly around New York with that
Superliner buzzin the city

big ol jet airliner
Ya know they're getting carried away-ay
Woa-oh big ol jet airliner
Got no words for what to say

Watchin this later on CNN
They're tryin not to look disappointed
They do their best to cheer for Obama
But crap like this just makes it tougher
If they'd just be honest with themselves
They'd say what's really on their minds
In-stead-they-try-to-blow-it-off-andmakefunof
People askin 'what the hell were you thinking?'

Oh, oh big ol jet airliner
Carry Obama back home
Oh, oh big ol jet airliner
Cause the white house ain't where he belongs

he's a member of the racist piece of garbage contingent on the board.

 

You are easier to bait than a large mouth bass.      

I'm curious Jilly, do you even know a black person? My black friends would have been the first to say what I just wrote. Of course, they have an actual sense of humor, part of the reason I'm friends with them. We actually enjoy life, we just don't take it so seriously, what's the point? Oh and half of them are embarrassed by Obammy, the other half voted for his coffee colored ass.  

 

Yo, Shit Arrow.........even though you "know a few black people", that still doesn't change the fact that on these boards you're a racist prick.

You didn't hide your racist qualities asshole.

 

What the fuck do you know skootersquib? I work with thousands of black people every day ace, different people most days. I have to trust them with my life and some I have become friends with. So you and that little California guilt ridden white girl can fuck off. You, as always, don't have a clue.

Obama has done more for the terrorist than the terrorist could have hoped for from any member of their own team. LOL

 

Bush got him beat there, too. Whenever a rightie bitches and moans about Obama, your boy has him beat every which way....

Doesn't make my observation any less true. Bush has created more terrorists than Obama ever will (if Obama will create any at all)....

So about an hour ago, I heard on CNBC that a large plane was circling Manhattan escorted by Fighter jets. Of course any normal reaction was that scared the shit out of me.

Apparently I wasn't the only one.

WTF is wrong with these people? You DO NOT have fucking fighter jets trailing a large commercial jet that's like a 747 with quad engines over Manhattan without giving us massive warning notices. The unjust panic this caused today in lower Manhattan should really be investigated.

A fucking photo-op???

A plane circling Lower Manhattan escorted by two fighter jets is part of a photo op, said Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Jim Peters. The event caused some evacuations of office buildings in Lower Manhattan and Jersey City, N.J., on Monday morning.

Mr. Peters said the Defense Department is conducting a photo op that involves deploying two F-16s and escorting a Boeing 747 in the vicinity of Lower Manhattan and the Statue of Liberty. He said the maneuver is not an emergency and was coordinated in advance with the FAA and state and local officials.

Theyll do two or three spins and be done by 10:30, Mr. Peters said.

Kevin Chin, a 25-year-old IT analyst with UBS working in Jersey City, N.J. was in the building when his coworker Yumi Nishiyama snapped this picture (above) around 9:40 a.m. on her iPhone. We didnt know what was going on until later on, said Chin, who did not evacuate the building.

Fucking idiots. WHO THE HELL DOES THIS??
