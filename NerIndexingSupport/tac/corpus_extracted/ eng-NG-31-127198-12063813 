When the Hokies play Boise State at FedEx field to kick off next
season, will the whole stadium just implode into a vortex of agony
when you put the two ugliest uniforms in Division I-A on the field at
the same time?

(I say this knowing that Va. Tech will probably wear the orange
jerseys with the maroon panels that they wore last year against
Georgia Tech. http://tinyurl.com/nbcyzc )
