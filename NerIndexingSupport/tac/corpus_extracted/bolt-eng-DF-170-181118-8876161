SEAL falls on grenade to save comrades

CORONADO, Calif. - A Navy SEAL sacrificed his life to save his comrades by throwing himself on top of a grenade Iraqi insurgents tossed into their sniper hideout, fellow members of the elite force said.

Petty Officer 2nd Class Michael A. Monsoor had been near the only door to the rooftop structure Sept. 29 when the grenade hit him in the chest and bounced to the floor, said four SEALs who spoke to The Associated Press this week on condition of anonymity because their work requires their identities to remain secret.

"He never took his eye off the grenade, his only movement was down toward it," said a 28-year-old lieutenant who sustained shrapnel wounds to both legs that day. "He undoubtedly saved mine and the other SEALs' lives, and we owe him."

Monsoor, a 25-year-old gunner, was killed in the explosion in Ramadi, west of Baghdad. He was only the second SEAL to die in Iraq since the war began.

Two SEALs next to Monsoor were injured; another who was 10 to 15 feet from the blast was unhurt. The four had been working with Iraqi soldiers providing sniper security while U.S. and Iraqi forces conducted missions in the area.

In an interview at the SEALs' West Coast headquarters in Coronado, four members of the special force remembered "Mikey" as a loyal friend and a quiet, dedicated professional.

"He was just a fun-loving guy," said a 26-year-old petty officer 2nd class who went through the grueling 29-week SEAL training with Monsoor. "Always got something funny to say, always got a little mischievous look on his face."

Other SEALS described the Garden Grove, Calif., native as a modest and humble man who drew strength from his family and his faith. His father and brother are former Marines, said a 31-year-old petty officer 2nd class.

Prior to his death, Monsoor had already demonstrated courage under fire. He has been posthumously awarded the Silver Star for his actions May 9 in Ramadi, when he and another SEAL pulled a team member shot in the leg to safety while bullets pinged off the ground around them.

Monsoor's funeral was held Thursday at Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery in San Diego. He has also been submitted for an award for his actions the day he died.

The first Navy SEAL to die in Iraq was Petty Officer 2nd Class Marc A. Lee, 28, who was killed Aug. 2 in a firefight while on patrol against insurgents in Ramadi. Navy spokesman Lt. Taylor Clark said the low number of deaths among SEALs in Iraq is a testament to their training.

That is heroism! Thanks for posting that!
 
 
  RIP  
 
 
Rest in peace, Michael Monsoor. You did far more than your part. Thank you for your sacrifice while protecting us. We can never be grateful enough. America will deliver justice to the bastard who killed you, and all the other terrorist monsters in Iraq, if the cut and run crowd does not win out.

We all know that I do not support the war, but damn! That is a brave and selfless thing to do. Petty Officer 2nd Class Michael A. Monsoor, I salute you.
 
 
My salute to you P.O. 2 Monsoor.
 
 
This man is a hero.

He is the kinda of person the vast a majority of our troops are.

We owe him and them a great debt.

We especially owe them the good sense to never send them into theater unless it is absolutly in the defense of our country.

Our foolishiness to send them into Iraq in no way deminishes his scarafice.

This only makes our debt to him larger.

That is my sentiment, exactly.

If we were to leave, we would not be cutting and running. We would be leaving. How do you know that cutting and running (as you put it) would be denigrating their service? Did he leave a letter giving his perspective on when he, and the other soldiers, should return home? I consider the job to be done. It is time to gradually bring our soldiers home and force the Iraqi people to take care of their own nation.
 
 
what part of the fact that Bush said we already won dont they understand.

We are now in an occupation and there is no "winning" in an occupation.

You just leave and let the people have their country back.

They have even asked to leave.

It would be interesting to know your “sentiments” towards a member of a foreign invading force occupying America and killed by american resistance movements, Skramer.

He's not a hero for invading iraq dumbass...he's a hero for laying his life down for his fellow soldiers, friends, comrades, etc...

It has nothing to do with agreeing or disagreeing with the war. He had no say where he is sent or when he is sent. So get off of your anti-war high horse and stop being jealous of someone who is more of a man than you will ever amount to.

My sentiments are real simple. If that so-called "resistance fighter" was a murdering scumbag waging war against noncombatants then I'd STILL call him a murdering scumbag, hero or no.

Then there's that other kind of scumbag. The kind that disagrees with something but cannot appreciate a selflish, heroic act for what it is without spewing his warped, backwards-assed views.

If you truly believe the views you expressed are correct, get out. You obviously belong someplace better.

Matter of fact, I think Iraq, or Palestine or Iran would be great places. Hell, you can even become a "resistance fighter."

I don't share all of Jose's opinions but you, sir, are as frightening in a debate as a sesame street puppet taking turns on a see-saw in the park on a sunny summer afternoon.

I favor a “fast track” approach to the democratization of Palestine, that is, the immediate beginning of the dismantling process of Israel following the south african transition model but with limited federal sovereignty under the supervision of the international community.

You support the gradual evolution of Israel from a racial dictatorship to a democratic state following the same historical pattern of the US.

This is a fundamental, not a cosmetic difference between us.

The independent nature of your thought regarding Israel is out there for everyone to see.

The thread I created for you to clarify your position dispersed any doubt that could still exist.

But I have seen many ventriloquist puppets in my life with more autonomous thought than this talking mule.
 
 
Thank you for putting into words what many others seem to think is expressed with a Scarlet A. It's good to know that a least a few USMB users can comprehend the nuances of our different opinions.

However, we both agree that Dr. Gump is less than impressive and it's a total fucking joke for him to assume that his points are profound without a shade tree to hide under. I can tell you the exact moment that I saw gump for the ignorant bastard that he is. He lost all respect the day he jumped in behind Jillians wake in a thread illustrating how actual western nations don't require an ethnic litmus test. I posed a list of prominent jews in America and he assumed that such a list was from stormfront despite my habit of citing my source (wiki, you KNOW what kind of jew hating antisemites THEY are.) When the facts didn't fit his assumptions he fell back on the knee jerk antisemite reflex anyway. That day he conveyed his ability to swim in deep water.

fuck gump. he is the weakest link.

My five year old could tear holes in your arguments without missing a beat. Your arguments are as vacuous as that alleged grey matter between your ears. As stated, I no longer need to debate you on the subject. You have nothing to offer but hatred and bigotry on the subject...

yea.. like a wikipedia list of prominent american jews, eh?

Indeed, you haven't torn your first hole yet but do pretend otherwise. You dont WANT to debate me because im already up to my knees stomping a mudhole in your ass already. Like I said, if it weren't for Jillian treading a path to follow you would have lost your way threads ago.

Seriously dude... set the bong down, keep your hands in plain sight and back slowly away....

Did I ever start or jump into a firearm/military strategy debate with you or CSM, Gunny?

Am I crazy enough to engage you in a serious discussion about pistols, automatic rifles, machine guns, rounds per second etc etc?

Do you remember the last time I presented an opposing view on military tactics, logistics or divisions, battalions and platoons?

Do I really look like someone who enjoys being chewed up and spit out?

The day I do any of these things feel free to post a message similar to the one I wrote to Grump:

Chill out, Paco.

For once we agree. Jose does that.

It's been "undegenerated."

One who sacrifices his/her own life to save others is the epitome of the word "hero."

Absolutely. I totally disagree with the US incursion into Iraq, but no matter how you cut it, no matter what any peacenik loon says, this man's act was heroic. And I'd think the world is a lesser place without him in it. Just my opinion of course. Obviously Jose will be doing his happy dance, but more fool him...
 
 
He's going to receive the Medal of Honor. Well deserved IMO.

I don't know about that RGS. Stubbornly staying to prove a point is egotistical, and the cost is too great. When will enough be enough? When will there be too many deaths for this war?

And in your own words, please explain what our objective is so we actually have a goal.
 
 
 
Hero my ass.

The only hero here is the iraqi fighter who blew up the invader of his homeland.

 

May the fleas of a thousand camels infest your armpits.

Considering there have been less deaths here then in any other war, by your reasoning we should have stopped in World War II right after Pearl Harbor. We should have stopped in World War I right after the Marne. We should have never even had the Civil War and the Revolutionary War should have stopped after Lexington and Concord.

We are there to help the Iraqis establish a democratic government, something that took from 1776 to 1789 in our country. And in our country all of the colonies were working towards a similar goal and didn't have years of distrust and hatred towards each other. Maybe we should give the Iraqis a break and give them at least the amount of time it took our country to do it.
 
 
He is a hero. He died for what he believed in.

 
We need people like you to stop denegrating their sacrifice by demanding we cut and run before the job is done.

 

Saying we need to get out of a war that should never have been started is not denigrating his sacrifice any more than you saying we should stay until the job is done. Hell, they can't even define what has to happen for the job to be done. "Cut and run." Nice frigging sound bite that doesn't mean crap.

Getting out of a war and cutting and running are not necessarily the same things.

Yours is a soundbyte as well. Try addressing the issue from an honest, nonpartisan and realistic viewpoint. You know... like a Marine?

We are where we are at this stage in time. What is your idea for disengaging in Iraq?

He has already stated his position in other threads, he supports us ABANDONING Iraq, you know "cutting and running".

And no matter how many times we repeat the goal some loser wants to know what it is.

We stay until Iraq is able to provide security inside the Country and along it's borders.
 
 
Retired, you as usual are full of shit.

Gunny, we give them a deadline and hold them accountable. It's like anything else in life, if you don't hold a person/people accountable, they don't have the incentive to act. We work with them as much as possible to help them, but when the deadline comes, we go fucking home. Not exactly rocket science.

Saying that setting a timeline is aiding the insurgents is bullcrap.

But to some it's not about the Iraqis being able to defend themself, it is about staying in Iraq forever. It is about the American Empire to some folks in power.
 
 
I forgot to answer this snide piece of crap:

 
like a Marine?

 

War Is A Racket General Smedley Butler. Another Marine who believed that wars should only be fought as the last resort.
