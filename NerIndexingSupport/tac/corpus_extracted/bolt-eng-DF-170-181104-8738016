"For we have a choice in this country. We can accept a politics that breeds division, and conflict, and cynicism. We can tackle race only as spectacle  as we did in the OJ trial  or in the wake of tragedy, as we did in the aftermath of Katrina - or as fodder for the nightly news. We can play Reverend Wrights sermons on every channel, every day and talk about them from now until the election, and make the only question in this campaign whether or not the American people think that I somehow believe or sympathize with his most offensive words. We can pounce on some gaffe by a Hillary supporter as evidence that shes playing the race card, or we can speculate on whether white men will all flock to John McCain in the general election regardless of his policies.

We can do that.

But if we do, I can tell you that in the next election, well be talking about some other distraction. And then another one. And then another one. And nothing will change. " Barack Obama

 Barack Obama | Meet Barack Obama 

 Deconstructing Barry 
 
 
Information from Publius Pundit:

(1) Obama said during the primary season that he would vote to block blanket immunity for telecommunications companies in connection with post-Sept. 11 eavesdropping. Now that he got the nomination, he's announced he'll vote in favor of immunity.

(2) During the primaries, Obama said he would insist on renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement to stop Mexico and Canada from abusing the system to harm the American economy. Now victorious, he supports the existing agreement.

(3) While seeking left-wing votes for the nomination, he said he would meet with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad without preconditions. The nomination sewn up, he no longer has any such intention.

(4) Filled with primary fervor, he said he could "no more disown Jeremiah Wright than his own grandmother." A few months later, he disowned him.

(5) Obama pledged unconditionally that he would accept public financing during the general election while he was talking to left-wing voters who despise the "fat cats." Now that he's been anointed, he's rejected public funding.

(6) An editorial in the Post adds yet another: Obama promised during the primary season to participate in a series of inclusive town-hall meetings with his opponent John McCain. McCain is still ready to do it, but now as the front runner Obama is backing out like a cowardly and very common politician. Change you can believe in?

As Krauthammer puts it: "By the time he's finished, Obama will have made the Clintons look scrupulous."

Why didn't you post anything concerning Obama's mentors and role models?
Why would you hide those factual details and only offer campaign rhetoric?
Shouldn't Americans be knowledgeable about their candidates?
 
 
The telecom immunity isn't the half of it. He voted to make it easier for the government to spy on Americans. Much easier. He's acted like a Progressive for the longest time but he certainly isn't acting like one now. Not that I'm a big fan of Progressives, but still.

What really makes me laugh, and cry, is watching the lefties excuse him at every turn.

The Democrat Congress has been doing the same thing for over 1 1/2 years now.
 
 
That's sad, too.

The admin. is pretty bad. Maybe one of the worst.

In just 8 years.
We got attacked on our own soil. We destroyed Iraq for nothing. Watched the economy go to trash. Ruined our budget and debt. Outsources tons of jobs. Let illegal immigration become a problem. Have not funded stem-cell research. Began an energy crisis. Began a food cost crisis. Never caught OBL. Proved that black people are less important than rich whites (katrina).

But hey, at least some of us (not me) got stimulus checks a few weeks ago!!!

That pretty much covers it. And the rise in oil prices is draining $600 billion dollars a year from the American economy while Alfred E. Newman sits in the White House and does nothing. God help us.

Bush this, bush that.... you can spew your bush hatred from here to eternity, but you're still behind the eight ball when it comes to what the country thinks of you demtards... who are primarily responsible for our gas crisis. They've been cow towing to the enviro-whackos for decades, and have OUTLAWED new oil exploration, new drilling, new refineries, clean coal and nuclear. The dems have had the majority in congress and had a sitting President for 38 of the last 45 years, and what do they have to show for it? An approval rating that's the LOWEST IN HISTORY! Yeah.... you fucking liberal, dem fucktards have SOOOOO much to be proud of... problem is, nobody fucking thinks so....

Cause they are easily manipulated into thinking that if we drill more oil then it will somehow not make it to the world market, and it will somehow knock off more than a few cents on the gallon in 7-10 years at the soonest.
 
 
 
Hence while drilling and development of oil shale is so important....

 

Your article said it wasn't cost effective. I bet their are planets out there that are swimming in oil, too. But if it isn't cost effective there is no point.
 
 
Um we been outsourcing jobs for far more than 8 years bud.
 
 
I agree that we need to develop alternative forms of energy,but what the dems need to understand is that we are not gonna wake up tomorrow and have a stable form of alt. energy. in the meantime we need to secure our needs for oil by drilling here at home both off the coast and in ANWR. Yeah I said it. this will secure our dependence on oil and allow us to drive down the cost per barell simply due to the speculation that we are drilling at home now, OPEC will drop the price giving us the much need drop in cost.

look at this way as well. China is about to start drilling about 70 miles off the coast of floridia, they dont give a damn about what our congress says WE can and cant do. and even worse, they REALLY dont give a damn about the enviromental standards that our oil companies are held to, SOMEONE is gonna drill there, wouldnt you RATHER have it be us so it is safer for the Enviroment?

If the oil companies are sitting on land contracts that are too difficult to tap, give them back.

LOL! That will never happen!!

We, the people are going to have to take this issue into our own hands by buying fuel efficient cars and electing public officials who will move us into alternative energy. The technology is there now. All we need is the political will.
 
 
This is quite a clever thread.

Its tantamount to someone posting videos of the My Lai massacre and titling the thread "Bush's Vision for the World."
