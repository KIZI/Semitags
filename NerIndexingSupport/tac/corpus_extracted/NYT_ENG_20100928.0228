Republican auditor candidate Mary Z. Connaughton, in a televised
debate
last night, appeared to back off her earlier opposition to a
controversial
ballot initiative that would slash the state's sales tax, saying
she was
undecided about the measure.

In an exchange with Democratic nominee Suzanne Bump on NECN,
Connaughton
was asked about her stance on Question 3 and said, "I'll make that
decision as it comes."

As recently as two weeks ago, Connaughton said, "I won't be
voting in
favor of Question 3," citing its impact on state finances.

Question 3 would cut the state sales tax rate from 6.25 percent
to 3
percent, which would open a $2.5 billion hole in the state budget
and lead
to layoffs and deep cuts to state and local services. A Globe poll
released
this week found that voters are split on the issue, with 46 percent
in
favor of cutting the tax and 43 percent opposed, with the remainder
undecided.

In a television appearance Sept. 16, Connaughton had aligned
herself with
the no camp. "My concern is that it's not going to foster spending
cuts,"
she said. "Question 3 has an enormous effect on the budget."

Asked to clarify her position after Tuesday's debate, spokesman
Mike Flynn
said that Connaughton remained opposed to Question 3 and favored
cutting
the sales tax rate to 5 percent.

"She's not reversing her position at all," Flynn said. "What
she really
wants is a 5 percent sales tax, but that's not on the ballot. This
is not,
for Mary, a black-and-white issue."

The debate, moderated by NECN's Jim Braude, was a rare showcase
for the
candidates for auditor, the state official in charge of
investigating
waste, fraud, and abuse in state government. Connaughton and Bump
are vying
to replace Democrat A. Joseph DeNucci, who is retiring after 24
years in
office.

DeNucci drew criticism this summer when he approved 5 percent
raises for
his staff, even as the state suffers from high unemployment and as
many
state employees face stagnant wages and layoffs. Both candidates
criticized
the raises Tuesday, but neither promised to rescind them if elected
on Nov.
2. Connaughton said she wanted to evaluate employee qualifications
if
elected, and Bump said she wanted to keep a free hand in staffing
the
agency.

"I'm looking at this not as a politician," Bump said.
"Looking at this
situation as a prospective manager ... you need to have all the
management
flexibility that you can have."

The Globe poll found the auditor's race was close, with 33
percent of
likely voters backing Bump and 29 percent supporting Connaughton,
within
the poll's margin of error of 4.5 percentage points. Thirty-six
percent of
likely voters said they were undecided, outpacing either of the
candidates.

In last night's debate, Connaughton, a former member of the
Massachusetts
Turnpike Authority board and former chief financial officer of the
Massachusetts State Lottery, sought to highlight her background as
an
accountant.

"You need to be an attorney to be the attorney general," she
said.
"Shouldn't you be an auditor to be the state auditor?"

But Connaughton sidestepped several questions, including on gay
marriage
and state pensions.

Bump, a former state legislator and lobbyist, resigned last year
as
Governor Deval Patrick's secretary of labor to enter the auditor's
race.

Pressed by Braude, she defended her past work as a lobbyist for
Citigroup
and an insurance industry trade group, where she advocated for
changes to
workers' compensation laws.

"We did good public policy work," she said. "I'm proud of the
work I did
for the American Insurance Association."

Nathanael Fortune, a Smith College associate professor of
physics, is also
in the race as a Green-Rainbow Party candidate.
