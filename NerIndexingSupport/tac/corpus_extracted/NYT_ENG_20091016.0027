The most dangerous young man on campus
stands about 5 and a half feet tall, covers his fiery red hair with
a modest ball cap, drawls sir and ma'am at his elders, and seems
well on his way to establishing a fine medical practice someday.
First, he has the weekend to get through.

The young man, Justin Pulliam, 19, the chairman of the Texas A&M
University chapter of the Young Conservatives of Texas, has been
asked to attend a forum featuring two presidents of the United
States, one of them the current officeholder.

"I actually did get an invitation," Pulliam said, "but I had
to decline due to our protest."

All across campus, from the large-animal veterinary clinics to
the storied Military Walk, students, professors and administrators
have been bracing for the arrival on Friday of President Barack
Obama, a suspected socialist and admitted Democrat. For an
institution often cast as country cousin to the University of Texas
at Austin, a turn in the national spotlight will present the chance
to put on a display of diversity, hospitality and achievement. Or
not.

Founded during Reconstruction as a men's technical college, A&M
(which stood for Agricultural and Mechanical) has nurtured a stoic
brand of conservatism steeped in the tradition of its Aggie farmer
nickname and the Corps of Cadets.

Public service is a serious proposition typified by the annual
Big Event, a sort of latter-day barn-raising that deploys thousands
of students in College Station and across the nearby city of Bryan
to mow lawns, pick up litter, paint and perform odd jobs. In recent
years, the university has established an international presence
with a robust student exchange program and centers in Mexico, Italy
and Qatar.

Still, this is no Berkeley. The university last made national
news in 1999 for the collapse of a pep rally bonfire tower that
killed 12 people. A walk across campus remains a quiet, almost
solemn idyll, where cadets march in formation, the most provocative
T-shirts feature slogans in favor of Jesus and the destination
signs on shuttles flash "Bush School."

The first President Bush ("41" to his admirers), for whom the
school of government is named, bears responsibility for inviting
his less-conservative successor to the campus. On Friday afternoon,
Obama is to join Bush before an invitation-only audience of 2,500
at Rudder Auditorium to commemorate the 20th anniversary of
"Points of Light," the presidential call to volunteer service.

"Surely everyone, almost everyone, anyhow, will take pride in a
visit by a sitting president," said George C. Edwards III, a
distinguished professor of political science at the university.

For his part, Bush has been taking no chances. After a summer of
contentious nationwide protests culminating in an outburst during a
congressional address, Bush issued a call for decorum on the front
page of the student newspaper this week.

"Howdy," his letter began, going on to renounce politics for
the occasion and conclude: "I cannot wait for Obama to experience
the open, decent and welcoming Aggie spirit for himself. This will
be an important national moment, and a moment for Texas A&M to
shine in the national spotlight as it always does. I hope and
believe it will serve as a point of Aggie pride for many years to
come."

But among the great Aggie traditions, few outshine the spirit of
the Twelfth Man, a reference to the stadium crowds at Kyle Field
taking an active role, by force of volume and sheer will, in the
outcome of events.

Unchecked fervor, of course, can be a raw and fearsome thing.
Last year, the Young Conservatives embarrassed the university by
throwing eggs at a picture of Obama ("He'll throw away your nest
egg," was the topical message lost to history) on national
television. T-shirts bearing the legend "Beat the Hell Outta
Obama," an ad hominem twist on a football slogan, did little to
improve matters.

"He's the president, and I respect him and I respect the
office, but I'm afraid students may not get that," said Hayden
Paul, 19, a sophomore student government official. "We've got
student groups on campus that may do something stupid, and that
scares me to death."

Pulliam, the leader of the Young Conservatives, was raised on a
100-acre cattle spread near the North Texas city of Sherman. He
counts 90 followers paying $20 for an annual membership, which
includes a maroon T-shirt depicting the school mascot, a purebred
collie, Reveille, and the slogan "Don't Tread on Me."

Believing his fellow students have lost their conservatism to a
mix of apathy and professorial indoctrination, he has planned a
rally for Friday afternoon involving costumes like Dr. Obama (a jab
at the president's stance on health care), the Grim Reaper (a less
subtle jab on the same topic), and Uncle Sam (?).

Since the egg-throwing episode, Pulliam has grown determined to
keep protest signs focused on policy messages. But he has little
control over the nonstudent groups, the likes of the Tea Party
chapters of Dallas and Houston, that have announced plans to join
his protest. Though he submitted a request for space across from
the auditorium, Pulliam anticipates being pushed across campus.

"It seems that maybe the university administration," he said,
"has been letting the White House be their main client."
