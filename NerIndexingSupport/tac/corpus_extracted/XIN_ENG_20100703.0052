At least 200 people were killed and hundreds more seriously injured on Friday
night in an oil tanker explosion at Sange locality in the east of the Democratic
Republic of Congo in an oil tanker explosion, local sources told Xinhua on
Saturday.

A source from the National Congolese Police (PNC) in Uvira said the explosion
happened at about 6:00 p.m local time (4:00 p.m. GMT) .

The police source noted that more bodies were still burning at the scene of the
accident.

"We are completely overwhelmed, the hospitals do not have necessary logistical
materials to treat those who are seriously injured," a medical source in Uvira
told Xinhua through the phone.

At least 200 people were killed when a fuel tanker overturned and exploded. Some
of the men were trying to steal the spilled oil. The Red Cross has also put the
death toll at more than 200.

UN said on Saturday that five peace keepers are among the dead but later revised
the statement, saying none of its peacekeepers was killed.

The oil tanker from Tanzania flipped over in the village of Sange, which is
located about 70 km south of the Sud-Kivu county town of Bukavu.
