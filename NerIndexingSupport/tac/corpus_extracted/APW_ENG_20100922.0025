Notre Dame and Navy will contest their annual American football clash in Dublin, Ireland, in 2012.

Navy athletic director Chet Gladchuk says the 50,000-seat Aviva Stadium will be the site for the 86th meeting between the Fighting Irish and Midshipmen.

"Obviously as an Irish-Catholic from Boston, I'm going to have a lot of requests for tickets," Notre Dame coach Brian Kelly said. "I'm excited about it."

Navy and Notre Dame have met every season since 1927. This season they will play at the New Meadowlands Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, on Oct. 23.
