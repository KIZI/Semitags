A spokesman for Dave Brubeck says the jazz pianist is doing well after surgery at a Connecticut hospital to install a pacemaker.

Patrick Giblin, spokesman at Brubeck's alma mater, University of the Pacific in California, says Brubeck's doctors expect him to be ready to resume concert touring in November.

Giblin said Brubeck is eager to return to the piano. The jazz legend had the surgery at Bridgeport Hospital on Monday after experiencing fatigue and dizziness at his home in Wilton, Conn.

Brubeck, who turns 90 in December, got an early birthday celebration in August when performing with the Wynton Marsalis Quintet at the Newport Jazz Festival in Rhode Island.
