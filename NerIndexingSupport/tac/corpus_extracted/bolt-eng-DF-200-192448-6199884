Ok regarding a recent event that happened lately and watching the news from both ends I thought Id wanna share this information with you folks.

As you all may have seen on the news lately the alquaeda leader in Iraq, Abu musaab al zarqawi released a video in which he said some really disturbing stuff.

Now I dont exactly know what news channel you guys watch but I am assuming its BBC and im also assuming BBC broadcasts nearly the same stuff that the CNN does.

Arabic being my mother tongue I was able to watch and understand the whole video that al zarqawi released recently because the Al Jazeera network aired the whole thing.

Unlike CNN where only a small clip of the video was shown and the whole message distorted from what the guy really said on Al Jazeera everything was shown and if you knew arabic you would have been exposed to some bitter truth on what has been really happening in Iraq.

So heres the story from al zarqawi himself this was the original broadcast on Al Jazeera.

-The americans are really incurring huge losses both arms and soldiers
around 20 + die per day
-The American soldiers have lost their fighting spirit, many are commiting suicide...apparantly its that bad
-When it comes to fight they need drugs to encourage them, the government is supplying this to them
-When its rest they pop pills till they are out
-The american control over the areas they claim as secure are far from the truth
-He even mentions that Bush has never spoken a word of truth to his ppl, lies on lies and the news broadcasts all of it as cover up and Bush himself is beginning to percieve his lies as the truth
-loads more regarding how the insurgents are getting more powerful and influential on the region

To be blunt the coalition forces arent doing too good out there

Now the CNN only showed part of the clip and they translated all the above into a single line Donald Rumsfeld said:

"This video is an act of desperation Al zarqawi is begging for help"

Thats it   + they do mention they are securing town by town and only report 8 dead per day.

Now my question is is the media controlled or is controlling what we see?

Also heres something to also keep in mind Al arabiya another arabic news network which is Al jazeeras rival. Now what i want to highlight here is that alarabiya is saudi owned and saudi arabia has very good relations with the US. Now alaribya also showed only parts of the video and they didnt really cover the whole story properly.

i hope you enjoyed this  
 
 
An important part of the War on Terror is the propaganda war. For the US to keep what little public support still exists for it, it has to do things like this.
 
 
Plus do you not consider that what Zarquawi (sp) is doing is not equally propaganda? While there may be elements of truth there it is equally designed to rally Muslims against American forces in the region. Since we in the West already know that Zarquawi is the bad guy, we don't particularly need telling that he is trying to rally the Middle East against us.

Well it can be seen as an act of desperation and as a by product he is begging for help.

Of course it is. But I thought that bit was too obvious to bother mentioning.   In response to your second point, though, it's not a case of our needing to be told anything, it's more the fact that we're not hearing "the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth".
 
 
It was aimed more at the OP but thanks for clarifying AS.
 
 
*grins inanely*
 
 
I'm glad you think Zarqawi keeps a better body count of American dead than the US military.   And I'm sure if an additional 3,000 American soldiers died (that the Pentagon didn't admit to), the families of those soldiers would never speak to the media and reveal the "conspiracy".   Or you know, perhaps Zarqawi is just a liar? And the things you mentioned were translated in one of the BBC articles.
 
 
He may be a liar, but you're living in a dream world if you think all the liars are in the enemy's camp.
 
 
I have 3 friends in the US military in Iraq (1 air force, one usmc's, one rangers/spec ops) and the USMC had this to say (amongst other things which i'll cut out for their irrelevancy):

 
Well I'll leave you with this bit of advice. Dont believe the news, we ARE doing good things over here, training up the Iraqis, and preping them to take over. Hope everyone is doing good, best wishes to you all!
 

He has a wife and young child at home, and while it pains him to be away, he said that if they asked him to do a second tour, he wouldn't hesitate (though he's still out there atm).

Make of that what you will.
 
 
No disrespect, but noble as it may be that's hardly conclusive.

You're living in a dream world if you think a democratic country like the US would ever manage to pull off a lie on such a scale. We get leaks about the lack of enough body armor. I'm sure if a few thousand extra men died, no one would ever leak such a story.

About two thirds of the US troops reenlist at least once.
 
 
What, the "lying about 3,000 soldiers" thing? Of course. I just meant generally.

There are very few lies coming from the Coalition. Most of the time, the military relies on giving ambigious information. The few lies that are given are about the time and place of specific operations (for obvious reasons).
 
 
I wasn't referring to just the military. Politics - US and otherwise - have come a long way since George Washington.
 
 
The main problem with the media is that it is commercial. They collect information, but are very selective in choosing what to broadcast to make sure they broadcast exactly what the people want to hear. If only it wasn't privatised. If only the lack of information could be stopped, it could prevent and solve alot of problems. Too bad everyone has a little interest in this, because it's so attractive to use it for your own purposes. Politicians know this like no other.

Because clearly public television is unbiased and agenda-free.   And clearly a media that would be government-owned would be more free from the influence of politicians than a private media.  
 
 
Who would you rather have supplying your information? Politicians or businessmen?

EDIT: Hmm. Thereby hangs a poll.
 
 
Oh good lord... the OP is either joking or blind...

You trust an Al Qaeda operative in hiding to tell you about the inner happenings of the US military and to do so in an imparital manner??

Who is likely to provide more accurate information, someone who's trying to make funny or someone who's trying to further their political career?
 
 
Well, both are trying to extend their influence.

If the businessmen lie, other businessmen and the politicians can expose them. Who'll expose the politicians when they control the media? No wonder you like communism so much.
 
 
Who'll expose them? Other politicians, of course.

How will they manage that when the government (i.e. one party) will control the media? But given your ideological preferences, most of the people who'd want to expose the ruling party would probably be in gulags by then...
 
 
If it's total control, they can't. Obviously. But how is that different from total control by business?

Because "business" doesn't have one interest. Or do you think the owners of the Guardian and the Telegraph will conspire to promote the same false news stories?
 
 
Well, nor do politicians. Even within a party there are people pulling in several directions.

Why exactly does someone as illiberal as you support the Lib Dems? I mean, I know they're the most socialist party of the bunch, but they do still claim to support civil and political liberties.
 
 
What's that got to do with it? It's true. In any case, much of the "authoritarian Soviet" stuff I post is either (a) playing Devil's Advocate, (b) in order to have it countered or (c) in order to annoy the Right.  

EDIT: There's a couple of reasons I support the Lib Dems. They're more successful than the Greens; they opposed the war; but mostly it's just the raw POWER.   And the sexual deviancy.
 
 
Zarqawi. That's who I go to for my news.
 
 
I find Al-Jazeera has a very good Sports section, but for Lifestyle and Fashion it's Pravda all the way.
 
 
Every one of Murdoch's 137 (I think thats the number) 'independent' news editors supported the Iraq war.

And we have a free press.
 
 
The aljazeera news is probably the best you can get, its the exact reason they were beanned from Iraq They are broadcasting what the American Big shots dont want you to know. Thats the exact same reason they never broadcasted the full video and revealed exactly what he said. Instead they censored the whole thing. This speaks for itself something al zarqawi confessed in the video he released made the american politicians uneasy They just couldnt play it on tv. If what he said is all Bull then WHY didnt they show the video to the public and mention that THIS GUY is a LOSER and he CANT prove WHAT he said.

Clearly the Guardian and the Independent supported the war as well.

OK, I was being sarcastic. I don't actually read Al-Jazeera's sport pages, and while they're far and away the freest press in the Arab world I still wouldn't trust them to be low in bias.

In the depths of the backwards Muslim world, maybe.
 
 
Murdoch definitely has a hand in. It was supected that the recent SkyNews love in with the BNP was a Murdoch attempt to split the Labour vote, as happened with the SDP.

I didn't say public television was unbiased.   And yes, that's the problem I was pointing out.

" Too bad everyone has a little interest in this, because it's so attractive to use it for your own purposes. Politicians know this like no other."

I was trying to say the media should be in the hands of others, but realistically it has nowhere to go. Sorry, I wasn't clear about that.
