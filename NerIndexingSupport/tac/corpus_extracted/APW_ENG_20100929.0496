Blending youth with experience, Canada is confident it can finish among the top three countries at the Commonwealth Games.

Canada, which was third in the medals table four years ago in Melbourne, Australia, is bringing more than 250 athletes to compete in all sports except netball and tennis at the Oct. 3-14 games.

"We're sending a strong team to Delhi," Canada chef de mission Martha Deacon said. "Among our athletes in Delhi are Olympic and Paralympic medalists, Commonwealth Games medalists, and world champions. Our goal is a top three finish overall."

Canada will send 40 athletes to compete in the track and field events in the Indian capital. Head coach Alex Gardiner said athletes can improve their chances for the 2012 London Olympics with strong performances in New Delhi.

"We are using the Commonwealth Games as an important benchmark for those athletes pursuing selection for the London Olympic Games," Gardiner said. "Results in Delhi will have a direct bearing on who we provide additional support for in the next two years leading to 2012."

Commonwealth Games veteran Angela Whyte and Dylan Armstrong will lead the track team in Delhi. Whyte won a silver medal in the 100 meters four years ago. Armstrong, who holds the Canadian record of 20.14 meters in the shot put, is a strong medal contender after a fourth-place finish in Beijing.

Other Canadian medal favorites are Jessica Zelinka in heptathlon and sprinter Jared Connaughton. Zelinka finished fifth in Beijing with a personal best 6,490 points, and Connaughton has a personal best time of 10.15 seconds in the 100.

Canada is looking to rebuild its swimming program and is sending 27 competitors to New Delhi, with former world champion Brent Hayden leading the men's team. Hayden clocked 48.19 seconds at the Pan Pacific championships in August for the second fastest time in the world in the men's 100 freestyle.

Annamay Pierse, who holds the world record in the 200 breaststroke, will be among the medal favorites for the Canadian women.

Canada is a powerhouse in synchronized swimming, winning all 14 golds since the event became a Commonwealth Games sport in 1986.

Marie-Pier Boudreau-Gagnon returns to defend the gold medals she won in solo and duet four years ago in Melbourne. Chloe Isaac and Elise Marcotte will be making their Commonwealth Games debut as the other members of Canada's synchronized team.

Six-time Olympian Susan Nattrass, who won three medals at the Melbourne Games, will lead a Canadian shooting team looking to continue a successful run of Commonwealth Games medals at the range that started in Manchester in 2002.

The Canadian men's rugby sevens team will get a chance to go up against powers like New Zealand, Australia, England and South Africa.
