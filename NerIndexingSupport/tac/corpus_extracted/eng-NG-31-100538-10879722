Hi folks,

I've just ordered a part at German, Swedish & French, paid the bill (part
£9*, shipping £5, doh), now it's a bit too late for the silly question, but
: has anyone ever ordered (or bought in-shop) at GSF, were you happy with
that ?

* The part I need is a winscreen washer pump, mine's packed in... The only
price I found in France was over 30EUR (£20). Not feeling like going to Pug
or a scrapyard, and the stores are all closed when I'm back from work.

Cheers,

Hi GT,

Yes, I have both ordered from them and bought in-shop from them, and
they are usually quite friendly and helpful.  They have shipped parts
between stores across the country so that I can collect with no extra
charge to me, and at relatively short notice.  I don't have any qualms
about going back to them.

Good luck!

Hi,

 

For the feedback : I went to the post office today to pick the parcel, fit
the pump... still no joy.
At this moment I have a call of my usual (not local anymore as I moved over
180 miles away) mechanic which had a problem with his PC's screen - won't
explain further here - I tell him about my problem, he tells me "come on, it
won't be the pump on these ones, usually the commodo, give it a squirt of
contact cleaner, may work, else go for a new commodo".
That was the commodo. A few squirts of WD40 did the trick. I fitted the new
pump anyway. Now it works. I feel a bit angry because of my wrong diagnostic
(which I checked and saw wrong today when using a probe bulb instead of the
voltmeter).

For archives : on automotive electrics, for such jobs, prefer the "test
lamp" you can build with a 12V/21W and a couple of wires.

Regards,

Hi,

 

Yes, and one of the (if not the) most cheap & reliable tools ever I already
knew... But with my industrial electrics / electronics engineering
background, I "naturally" took my voltmeter, and although not totally
trusting it, it was far good enough to tell me 0 or 12V. As the symptoms
were close to a worn pump, considering it was 14 years old (like the car
indeed)... It doesn't matter, it's gone now. Now I'll see if the GSF pump is
as reliable as the Seim Pug fit at they factory, long long years ago.

Hi,

 

I had to drive during a couple of weeks without, and that's not the good
season for... I have to say it's somewhat comfort :-) I omit the fact you
can fail your MOT for that, mine is due within 18 months ;-)
