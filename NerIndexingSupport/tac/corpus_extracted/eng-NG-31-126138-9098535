Yup. I'm a gamecock.

That was a crazy, crazy game.
That really surprised me too. LSU has always been a well-conditioned,
second-half team and just looked tired out there in that game.
Personally, I think Les Miles coached them out of that win. With the
game on the line they ran all 4 downs straight up the middle. WTF!
That's just poor coaching. If he had that little confidence in his QB
to actually make a single pass - a slant, a screen, ANYthing - then
maybe they don't need to be in the NC game.

What a game indeed! I really didn't see it turning out as it did.

Me neither. I would have been happy with a respectable game. I was
there in the middle of UK madness and it was pretty great after years
of abject humility. We get fined now 50K for rushing the field. That's
just wrong. How can you deny a serious celebration?

Hey Tube! Holding LSU was pure magic. This weekend UK faces the
Gators. That's going to be another tough uphill game. As for the
Vols..I think it's high time for a victory against Big Orange. ;-)
cheers,

Florida--45
KY--37.

FL had lost the previous 2 games and they had two weeks to prepare a win
against the Cats. The Gators were a well oiled machine. Their defense was
all over us. Still it was a pretty darn good fun game. UK football has come
a long way. What more can ya ask for? Oh sure, a win against TN this year
would be pretty sweet after all these years! C~

Rather our defense could not hold FL...for anyone who saw the game, a
recap is unnecessary. And if you didn't see the game, you probably
don't care!

37 points. Are you sure they were all over you?

It is nice to see Kentucky doing well in football. Kansas and Indiana are
having pretty good seasons so far as well. The only team missing is North
Carolina.

It was a good game, no doubt. It seemed they were able to keep
blitzing our quarterback Andre Woodson. With that said the team has
come a long way. I'm proud of how well they've done..I hope it keeps
on since we have season tickets.

 

We always pull for OSU (Big Red) given our OH connections. I was in
Columbus the year (2002) when they won the championship, that was fun.
