I've always wondered why this is. Anyone care to tell me?
 
 
Because flufy bunny rabbits have purple tails.
 
 
Isnt that a pretty generalised view. Personally I dont think your accusation will be true in very many cases.
 
 
Not all muslims hate jews... but I'd say that it has a lot to do with poverty, lack of education, and lack of freedom. Prosperous democracies don't tend to breed terrorists.

Muslims aren't the only group with a general dislike for Jews, though they may be the most virulent.
 
 
Palestine
 
 
A lot of people seem to dislike Jews. The reason is that they are, simply, better than us. Israel-Palestine might also have something to do with it.
 
 
I'm a Muslim and I wouldn't say I dislike Jews as a whole because I did have a few Jewish Friends. However, I can see Muslims who are 'ghettoed' into their own little communities and don't mix with a diverse body of people can have a certain animosity towards Jewish people due to the on-going conflict in the Middle East. But more open-minded Muslims know that some Jews are good and some are bad, and you would get that in all religions, including Islam.
 
 
But you must also realise that orthodox Jewish people believe they are the 'chosen people' by God and therefore 'superior' everyone else. This would naturally arouse discontent among non-Jewish.

Muslims and Christians do believe that they are right but they don't believe they are chosen by God. Jewish do believe they are 'chosen' hence it is so difficult to convert to Judaism because you have got to be born into the religion.
As it says on the BBC site:

"Jews believe that God appointed the Jews to be his chosen people in order to set an example of holiness and ethical behaviour to the world." (  http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religi...fs/index.shtml  )

In the Quran it states that Jews are the sworn enemies of Islam. Case closed.

I agree but you still assume that your actions are morally superior to those you are setting an example to.
 
 
They don't. I was conversing with one on Thursday, i told him i was jewish. He was fine, we talked - he even invited me to his house, gave me some food and we just chatted about religion and it was fine. He didn't go and get a butcher's knife and try and kill me or anything like that. As for those staing what the Quran apparently says - do you have a knowledge of arabic and actually read the Quran to make that statement or just going by hearsay?

Isnt it commonly percieved, muslim = anti semetic??? or am i just being silly....
 
 
Ask yourself this question Mr Thread starter, if that is your real name:

Why does everyone hate everyone these days?

Money, greed, power, OIL, resources, fit women (have you guys noticed that you don't really tend to get fit women at the North/South Pole.. maybe that's why it's so cold down there... just a thought.

EDIT: Maybe its becasue Santa is fat?

EDIT EDIT: Fat is the new slim.. north poles the place to be guys...harbouring all the chicks   !

Christians would actually argue Jews were God's chosen people once upon a time but then ****ed it up. They can make up for it by becomming a Jewish-Christian though. In fact one of the gospels (I think Matthew) is from a very pro-Jewish point of veiw, indeed in early Christianity there was a big split between those who saw Christianity as a Jewish sect (i.e. no Gentiles) and those who saw it as a general religion.

Evangelical Christian will present you their version of the religion as incredibly simple, yet they seem to skirt around the issue of why exactly God had a chosen people etc. The Old Testament is important to the older churches but seems ignored by the more evangelical ones except as to provides motivational stories and iron cast descriptions of creation.

Muslims believe the Torah and Gospels to be corrupted so don't accept the Jews as God's chosen people. Indeed the Islamic story of Abraham differs in that in the Judeo-Christian description it is said to be Isaac who was going to be sacrificed and in the Islamic version it is Ismael. (Traditionally Isaac is seen as being the father of the Jews and Ismael of the Arabs)

But this suggets that others are not at your level of morals and you are morally superior unless they are brought up to your level. The goal might not be superiority but the fact that you feel others are morally "low" compared to you does suggest you are somehow superior (morally )

I don't know why some Muslims (I only know that pirate Abu Hamza) hate Jews so viciously. I mean they People of the Book who share our Scripture.
Also, Muhammed would get on well with the Jews at his time and I've heard of many who have talked to him (and Aisha) and inspired him. I have heard of some who came to him complaining about the behaviour of some Muslims.

Not outside Arabia though, the Christian world saw Islam as its greatest threat for a whole millenia!
 
 
I remember hearing a lecture once, saying that the reason Muslims felt angry with Jews was that they should be Muslims. The idea behind this was that Muslims felt that the Christianity had got it so laughably wrong (no offence to christians!), they weren't bothered about them not being part of Islam. But Jews and Muslims share reverence for the Torah/O.T and Muslims feel like the Jews are like a brother that betrayed them.

Comments?

You, my friend, talk utter codswallop. "Chosen people" doesn't mean "superior," but means picked for a particular mission - spreading the belief of monotheism and maintaining righteousness and justice. Abraham and his descendents were chosen for this mission because he was the first to recognise G-d amongst corruption in the world. We don't think we are better than anyone else at all. Common misconception.

Are we also forgetting that Muslims and Christians think they're also chosen too? I don't have any problem with that. Everyone to their own beliefs. Koran: "..Muslims as his truely chosen people.."

No they don't. Sure both groups think they're right ideologially, but they still don't think they're the 'very special people that god picked to lord over all other races'.

Of course it existed, maybe people didn't realize why but they can look about and quite clearly see when they travel. Only back then, people weren't being forced to live together under the ludicrous idea of 'multiculturalism'.

I never said I'm BNP.

That's only one theory. There are also others which say we're not all descended from Africans.
 
 
some thoughts
1. jews are easy scape goats... did anyone notice how when demark starts on islam, the response is to attack the jews? Was the cartoonist jewish?
2. there is discontent/jealousy of arab countries due to the fact that israel, with western money has modernised incredibly in 50years, and is no longer the swampland that it was
3.jews have always found themselves forced either by profession as money lenders, or just by climate, (and indeed the value placed on learning in the torah) to not become blue collar workers, but instead have gone onto universities and such like. Subsequently, there is a perception of jews as rich and clever...surely even in the playground, it is clear that the swots are picked on, as are the rich kids who stick out like a sore thumb.

Is that what I said? Are we all the same? Is that what the world's peoples feel and see?

Or are you a racial straw-man? Why?
 
 
Well said. Multiculturalism is causing many woes in Britain. I am all for people moving to Britain but one should try to integrate in some way. What about British culture?
When I moved to Japan, I was under no illusions I was different. The government ID card states 'Certificate of Alien Registration'. There is no way I could ever be Japanese but I will at least try to learn the language, stick to their laws and respect their culture, I don't expect changes which impact apon the majority being forced through for a minority.
Maybe people should show more respect for the culture of the country they move to.
Respect goes both ways.

In many parts of the world this is correct. Is it true in Europe? Is it really easier or more accepted to attack Jews as a group over Muslims as a group? It simply isn't. Any daily paper proves it.

You may feel that Jews are easy targets, but if you had the sensitivity of an average Jew and were in a gentile White body you would see things very differently. I can recall Jewish Jack Straw saying that the English were peculiarly racist and violent, nothing similar would EVER pass the lips of a gentile Minister regarding the Jews. And rightly.
 
 
Im a Muslim, I dont hate Jews. Ali G is a joker!
Anyways, it has alot to do with them and palestine and taking their land. Also, no Western country will say anything against them due to the fact that most of the big businesses are partly/fully funded by jews.
 
 
Jack Straw is a jew?

"I don't expect changes which impact apon the majority being forced through for a minority"

Like the failed religious hatred bill - brought in solely for one certain group.

I do. If Blacks, Jews, Arabs etc. can be races, why do people think that the idea of a white race is somehow 'racist'?! Ridiculous. Why can't whites be a proud race with a proud culture and heritage too?
 
 
doesn't it basically go back to palestine? rightly or wrongly palestinians and muslims in general still hold a grudge for the land was stolen from them and which is still being occupied by israel. stuff like that happens and perhaps they should get over it(im greek cypriot, we did), but i think what really gets them is that nothing has been done to punish the israeli's, quite the opposite, they have been aided and supported by the most powerful country in the world.

True, though from about 700AD to 1700AD a various times it threatened to make Christianity extinct in the long term, a threat which seems to have passed.
 
 
I would raise the point that there may be an even greater level of racism in perceived minorities groups than one would think, since the liberal elite feel they cannot do any wrongs and any attept to say otherwise is suppressed by the agents of the state, i.e the police!
I have heard of racism within families who's child decides to date/marry a white man or woman. I have encountered this exact situation, but you don't hear me or others shouting racist and calling the police.

Should a British minister of any ethnic group be allowed to criticise the English in a way he wouldn't get away with for Jews (as well as others)? Should minorities have acquired such status? Should such priveleged status continue?

That's a particularly poor example. 1) he isn't a minister, 2) he insulted no people, 3) he was criticised where Straw wasn't.

Livingstone insulted no-one but Daily Mail staff, the furore indicates Jewish hyper-ethnic sensitivity. It does them few favours because it turns out to mean double standards, the sensitivity is not as often returned as it should be.
 
 
I am a muslim I dont hate jews but I hate Zionists, it could be christian Zionists and also could be secular Zionists. It is definitely linked to Palestine, most muslims feel that jews all over the world, support directly or indirectly the state of Israel. The state of Israel reminds all Muslims of their weakness. Palestine surrounded by millions of muslims and they are still unable to retrieve it.

But again I myself have no problem with jews and have many friends that are jews. Historically, Arab jews and Arab Muslims fought together against Christian crusaders. But it went all wrong with the birth of Zionism, which developed to oppressing ideology.

1.if by insult, you mean he "spoke" to a daily mail member of staff then fine, you are correct. If he insulted as in was "offensive to", then im afraid you are incorrect. If i say i was offended, that automatically makes you incorrect. so yeah, i was offended, and you are incorrect.
2.ok so he isnt a minister. but he is still is postition of authority, and in the melting pot of muliticulturalism that is london, it would do to have a mayor who was prepared to accept people for what they are, and not bring race into it, as he did. even when he knew the reporter was jewish, he continued to compare him to the ss guard. now, if that doesnt smack of intolerance, i dont know what will.
3. if jack straw isnt jewish, and he said those things, are jews still to blame? in the muslim worlds eyes yes (as seen by the jews being blamed for the cartoons) and seemingly in yours too.

just a question.... the cartoons showed the prophet mohammed acting/dressed as a suicide bomber? surely those muslims who dressed up as suicide bombers are guilty of idolatry? there is a reason why gods aren't drawn- so people cannot worship copy them? so dressing up surely copies them? just goes to show how islam has been hyjacked by militant, ill educated nutters.
 
 
"How dare those evil Jews actually want some self-determination and a right to live in their own State?!
I mean, Arabs only have 23 States covering 11MILLIONsqkm, those pesky Jews with their single 20,000sqkm State RUINED IT ALL. So we have to hate them and attack them because of that, it's an invasion of our land! Forget that their country is roughly 0.002% of the size of the Arab World, Zionism is evil and expansionist!"

What a load of moronic tripe.
 
 
A stupid question perhaps, but why would anyone not want jews to have their own state?

for the anti-semites it gets jews away from them and out of their countries.
for the other people it won't affect them at all so why should they care.

yea but the anti semites would prefer it if every jew was washed into the ocean and killed. plus also cos israel is in the middle of arab lands, and yet even though it is the only part of the desert without oil, it is more modernised than other places due to foreign investments.
 
 
Bismarck, what you are saying does not explain why jews chose to resist christian crusaders. If you are trying to justify the betrayal of jews to the Arabs by saying they were second class citizens, I will tell you, you are talking nonsense, Jewish immigrations even started under Ottoman rule to the opposition of Arabs. On society level, all minorities were respected. Ask any Arab Christian and he will gladly tell you. This explains why Christians have and always considered themseleves Palestinian Arabs and not Israelies.

And Jo...H with all due respect but your logic escapes me, to me you are speaking total nonsense. You are saying take away Arab land, kick people out, wipe out villages and cities, install jews there and establish a state of Israel on occupied in the middle of 11 million muslims justifiying it as being okay because there are lots of land Palestinians can just go live there. It is total nonsense. I have a better idea how about taking the 5 m jews from the middle of the 11 million muslims and Arabs, take them to Europe, establish a jewish state there, they can live in harmoney and happiness. Problem solved, I am sure you will agree

No, I don't think so. I think most would be just happy to have them out the country. But that still doesn't answer the question.

Now that is your problem with the proposition? which country? Dont worry that would be solved, the important thing is that all Jewish immigrants agree to this proposition. There are lots of useless Islands, we can put them in the states, lots of land there. It can be the 51st state, if its already not.

So you intend on kicking out people who live on these islands just to give the jews somewhere nice to live?

But that's Israelis. So why label them Jews? I thought we don't get Jews and Israelis mixed up. I thought anti-Israel had nothing to do with anti-semitism. Or so it seemed on this board a few months ago. At least you've all admitted it now anyway. And according to that logic, anyone who hates Israel, hates the Jews.

And why is it people seem to think that big businesses are run by Jews, or are shocked at such a thing? Jews are humans, and just because of their religion it doesn't mean they can not be professionals. What difference does it make? There are Muslim and Christian professionals too.

What a load of garbage.

You are just being difficult, embrace the concept first.

We were not the ones who immigrated from Europe to Palestine during the 19th century. Why the hypocracy, isnt it clear, you immigrate there, most ancestors of Israeli citizens are traced to Europe, is that a coincidence?

How did they get to Europe?

They emigrated there in c.16th century.

So no, they have no claim over the land at all.
 
 
which European country are you talking about?
 
 
Didn't realize it was that early.

They didn't start gaining any kind of population in Eastern Europe until around the 16century so I assumed it was the same all over Europe. My mistake.
 
 
Do you think Jews would be happy to have an island to themselves or do they prefer to be closer to the Holy Land?
 
 
here we go again, Israelies construct a whole story to fit themselves. It is disgusting, in 1888 Jews only made up 4% of the population in Palestine. Immigration is not when 2 or 3 families move, I am talking about a high scale immigration and it was not present until the END of 19th century. Do you think the Ottomans would allow immigration on high scale? You do not make sense, it was not until the end of 19th century when Ottomans, under pressure as they grew weaker, allowed the immigration to start.

What you are talking about is a myth, as a Palestinian I find it strange how you are even confident aswell and went to check out a source, it is really shocking. But I guess it is a way to prove your side of the story.

Anyways I am off.
 
 
And Jews were kicked outta Spain in the 1400s, so there'd been there well before that...
 
 
Witout any religion the world would be a better place.

I take offense at that - are you legitimising hate of orthodox Jews? Its very rich coming from a Moslem, seeing as the Qu'ran states that Jews and Christians should be killed - so its OK to disciminate against Moslems then is it?
 
 
As far as I'm aware Moslems also believe that the Jews WERE the chosen people until they spurned Jesus, making God switch to the line of Ishmael - and the arabs, making them chosen. Does that mean I have a right to hate arabs?

Morally Repugnant Christian Quotes Advocating Killing and Rape

"[The Israelites] warred against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded Moses; and they slew all the males. [...] And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods. And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all their goodly castles, with fire. And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men and of beasts. [...] And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive? [...] Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves."
(Numbers 31:7-18, KJV)

That's just beautiful, isn't it? Imagine telling that to your kids as a bedtime story: "And then the Lord commanded Moses to murder all the male babies and the women who have had sex. But they kept alive all the young nubile virgin girls so that they could have fun raping them, and so everyone lived happily ever after."

"O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us. Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones."
(Psalms 137:8-9, KJV)

O daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction, happy is he who repays you for what you have done to us -- he who seizes your infants and dashes their brains against the rocks.

"And [Joshua's army] utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword. [...] [Joshua] left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of Israel commanded."
(Joshua 6:21 and 10:40)

Ahhh, another beautiful bedtime story. God commanded Joshua to murder a whole city, so he took his army into the city and they stabbed everyone in the belly with their swords, including the children and animals!

"I will sing praise to your name, O Most High.... The enemies have vanished in everlasting ruins; their cities you have rooted out; the very memory of them has perished.... The LORD will swallow [up his enemies] in his wrath, and fire will consume them. [He] will destroy their offspring from the earth... their children from... humankind."
(Psalms 9:2, 6, and 21:9-10)

Such a benevolent god.

"[Thousands of angels] proclaimed with loud voices: 'Worthy is the Lamb who was slain, to receive power and wealth, wisdom and might, honor and glory and praise!'... I saw heaven wide open, and a white horse appeared; its rider's name was Faithful and True, for he is just in judgment and just in war.... [H]e was robed in a garment dyed in blood, and he was called the Word of God. The armies of heaven followed him.... Out of his mouth came a sharp sword to smite the nations; for it is he who will rule them with a rod of iron, and tread the winepress of the fierce wrath of God the sovereign Lord."
(Revelation 5:11-12 and 19:11, 13-15)

Worthy is the person who has killed people in order to get power and wealth? What sort of morals are these to teach to your children?? If god were a person, we would have put him in jail with a life sentence by now.

"Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace but a sword."
(Jesus according to Matthew 10:34, KJV)

"Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip; and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one."
(Jesus according to Luke 22:36, KJV)

Great, Jesus, that is just what we need -- more violence, more wars, no peace. I think Jesus (if he really existed at all) was a fugging *******. The world needs PEACE, not violence, and yet here we have Jesus saying that he sends violence (a sword) not peace.

"But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me."
(Jesus according to Luke 19:27, KJV)

Here we have another example of Jesus being a homicidal megalomaniac. Bring all the people that he does not reign over, and murder them in front of him? In the parable of the talents, Jesus says that God takes what is not rightly his, and reaps what he didn't sow. The parable ends with the words of Jesus as quoted above.

"And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid, betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; she shall be scourged; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free. And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, even a ram for a trespass offering. And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering before the LORD for his sin which he hath done: and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven him."
(Leviticus 19:20 - 19:22)

If you read this carefully, you will see that it is saying that if a man has sex with a slave woman, then she must be scourged/punished, but the man's sins "shall be forgiven him". A man can rape a slave women and be forgiven!

"And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the whore, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire."
(Leviticus 21:9)

In other words, if the daughter of a priest has sex, she must be burnt to death. Good ol' Christian morals.

"Every one that is found shall be thrust through; and every one that is joined unto them shall fall by the sword. Their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses shall be spoiled, and their wives ravished. [...] Their bows also shall dash the young men to pieces; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eyes shall not spare children."
(Isaiah 13:15-18)

Kill the children in front of their parents, and rape the wives! _HOLY ****_! How much of a perverted psychopath do you have to be to write something like that?? I think the christian bible must have been written by serial killers!

"And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt: And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill; and all the firstborn of beasts."
(Exodus 11:4-5)

As you can see above, christianity promotes killing people who believe differently, and it promotes children being "dashed to pieces" before the eyes of their parents, and young virgin girls being raped after their parents are killed. Even Jesus himself speaks of "slaying" people. Anyone who promotes the christian bible, knowing that it contains these things, is a SICK and TWISTED person. And note that the above is only a PARTIAL list of the sections of the bible promoting killing, rape and other sick activities!

Furthermore, it is a fact that Catholic priests regularly sexually abuse children (Click for examples from the media). I think that every priest should be given a free surgical castration when he is ordained.

Above, I have only been dealing with violence, killing, and rape, but the christian bible is also packed full of other immoral and unethical orders. For example, women should be horrified when they read that the christian bible orders women to relinquish their rights and subject themselves to their husbands authority in every way:

"Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be [subject] to their own husbands in every thing."
(Ephesians 5:22-24, KJV)

And parents should be horrified when they read that jesus says you must hate your family if you want to be his disciple:

"If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple."
(Jesus according to Luke, 14:26, KJV)

For more information about the hundreds of immoral and unethical passages in the christian bible, I recommend that you visit the Skeptics Annotated Bible website.

The best proof that god does not exist is that if he did exist, he would have smote you damn christians by now. I mean, seriously, what god would endure the way these christians behave? Even if a christian god did exist, he would have died of embarrassment by now.

In all seriousness, it is less of an insult to be called a Devil-Worshiper than a Christian. Have Christian's conducted violent Crusades of mass-murder? Yes, read the history books. Have Devil-Worshipers? Not that I am aware of. Or even if they have, the number of murders conducted in the name of the Devil is surely 1% of the number of murders conducted in the name of Christianity. When one considers the violent and murderous history of Christianity, one has to conclude that Christianity's depiction of the Devil is -- at the very least -- a case of the pot calling the kettle black.
 

This.

2.ok so he isnt a minister. but he is still is postition of authority, and in the melting pot of muliticulturalism that is london, it would do to have a mayor who was prepared to accept people for what they are, and not bring race into it, as he did. even when he knew the reporter was jewish, he continued to compare him to the ss guard. now, if that doesnt smack of intolerance, i dont know what will.
3. if jack straw isnt jewish, and he said those things, are jews still to blame? in the muslim worlds eyes yes (as seen by the jews being blamed for the cartoons) and seemingly in yours too.

just a question.... the cartoons showed the prophet mohammed acting/dressed as a suicide bomber? surely those muslims who dressed up as suicide bombers are guilty of idolatry? there is a reason why gods aren't drawn- so people cannot worship copy them? so dressing up surely copies them? just goes to show how islam has been hyjacked by militant, ill educated nutters.

 

1) Your "sensitivity" is not the societal measure of "offensive". Quote Livingstone and say what offended you -- you will seem over sensitive, unless you are a Daily Mail reporter in which case you will seem dishonestly over-sensitive.

2) He didn't say anything much. Certainly nothing offensive to normal Jews. He routinely adopts positions antithetical to the ethnic interests of White londoners and never faces criticism from Whites --except the "racists" who are roundly condemned.

3) If Jack Straw isn't Jewish then he has been misrepresented across the web and in the msm. I don't care and I guess he doesn't if he has never corrected the misapprehension. What did I blame Jews for?

Not good enough, frankly ********! Though I can't offer anything more persuasive to say he is Jewish.

I assumed that Dalyell who presumably knows the guy, was saying something ethnically if not politically accurate.

Your assumption about my sources is unworthy of you Bizzy. I don't know where to look to find the false facts you claim - where did you find them? Share them.

I find it offensive that mr ken can equate anybody with a member of the nazi killing machine, who was part of an attempt to wipe out a whole human race. Especially when the man in question is merely asking a few questions. It is hardly " we have vays of making you talk". It does smack of the whole "oh, the holocaust wasn't such a big deal" The fact that even after ken finds out the bloke is jewish makes it even worse because he is being personally offensive to someone who is only trying to do his job. Is that simple enough for you to understand why i am offended? Over sensitive? well you know what, lets take all your immediate relatives, stick them in an oven, bake em, shake em, p*ss on the ashes, and then sh*t on them. Over sensitive? sonny, you think this is over sensitive, im barely getting started.

2) He didn't say anything much. nice contradiction there...anything much. my old mans a mushroom by the way if we are going to talk nonsense. Certainly nothing offensive to normal Jews. so some jews aren't "normal"? rabid jews perhaps? jews with three heads? the ones with big hats and silly hair?what exactly is a normal jew, i would love to know? are there non normal jews in the same sense that there are non normal muslims who go around blowing things up? He routinely adopts positions antithetical to the ethnic interests of White londoners "routinely"? when? not just one example, but several, seeing as he does this so "rountinely" and never faces criticism from Whites --except the "racists" who are roundly condemned. i do beleive ken is routinely criticised by most people for allowing radical muslim extreemists into london.

3) If Jack Straw isn't Jewish then he has been misrepresented across the web and in the msm. I don't care and I guess he doesn't if he has never corrected the misapprehension. What did I blame Jews for?

 

i was suggesting that were a white non jewish man such as jack straw to make a comment that you viewed as rascist towards other white non jewish people, would you view that as rascist seeing that he is from the same racial group??

Quickly, the religious NEED has the same source as the need for knowledge (so science and development) and the same source as the need for company and security (so friendship and organisation). Without religion we'd be without all the things which make life worth living. Religion is simply a part of what Humans are, and the drives which create religion, we see with a moments reflection is also what creates every human pleasure.

Toscar, my monitor doesn't pick up much colour, I was lucky to find the unusually placed words. Likewise your meaning...

This is what you said: "you mean like how ken livingstone was made to quit his job and forced to live in pig sh*t? yup, see what you are talking about"

Forgive me for not understanding that you meant to ask: if "a white non jewish man such as jack straw to make a comment that you viewed as rascist towards other white non jewish people, would you view that as rascist seeing that he is from the same racial group?" Aren't I stupid to miss your real meaning..!

Your other "points",

I think racists are sometimes racist toward groups they ought to consider themselves menbers of and defend. Why do you ask anyway> it's irrelevant.  

>No contradiction there.

>>Never by people arguing for the rights of majority and indigeneous to continued such status -- without blanket condemnation. So again irrelevant.

The land of your forefathers? wtf are you talking about? People have papers that constitues the ownership of their land. You are building fascist state on the basis that once an imaginary father of yours existed there and wants you to exist their on principles that the present state upholds?. Arabs were the inhabitants of this region for the past 3000 years. What I was trying to say in my proposition is if jews want to escape rascism from europe and the US then go somewhere else, if you want to stay for religious reasons, then feel free to stay, there is no reason to set up an Aparthied government and force people out of their homes.

I dont quite understand what point you are trying to make, but if you are trying to say that Palestinians forced out the jews, with all due respect Bismarck but thats nonsense. Palestinians were under Ottoman occupation, everyone was a second class citizens, please remember that.

The fact of the matter is the first immigration started in 1882 when a russian priest was assassinated and fingers were pointed towards jews and that is why it started.

Before that there was jewish visits to the holy land for religious purposes and they were with small numbers. Even in 1947 the number of jews were 20%.

Please dont tell me you are suggesting that Jews as a nation existed and ruled the region and then were replaced by greeks/romans and natives and we replaced them.

First of all this is not true, jews were part of many nations that inhabited the region, there was Phonecians, Kanaan and Aramians (dont know the term in english).

Second, I think you are not trying to justify the existance of Israel on that basis, then I would say thats nonsense, even if we are talking facts the whole jewish nation started in Iraq if it is started anywhere not Palestine.

I hope that you understand that this is irrelevant to the conflict, most Israeli thinkers and politicians consider Israel a fruition of jewish movement started in the 19th century.

Yes, they came with the Norman conqueror's as moneylenders, but (with a couple of massacres in between) were expelled in 1290 by Edward I after he got into major debt and kicking them out was considered preferable to defaulting. They came back under Cromwell.

Was it still Israelities who lived in the Levant during the Byzantine reign of the area?

Yeh, you'll find alot of things are biblically based or copied from.
 
 
Well I will not engage in a low level discussion with you. But you talk complete nonsense again, you have no clue what you are talking about. The only time when jews had ruled anything(in the region) was under Dawood's kingdom and for only 70 years. Even under that rule, there were other nation that lived there. They ruled like any other nation, how christians ruled, how muslims ruled. That doesnt mean the land belongs only to Jews? it is a ridiculous claim. They weren't the first or the last nation that ruled for a considerable amount of time.

Should I go read history? the mythology that jews created to justify the state of Israel? Logically what you say does not make sense, even Israelies no longer try to justify the state of Israel according to some made up history. There argument is about how they won the war in 1948, they worked hard to earn their state therefore they have the right to exist.

But the points you are making are ridiculous and out of touch. It is strange how confident you are....
 
 
It's strange how confident you are to come on this board and just assert that people who have gained a reputation for vast knowledge and understanding 'know nothing'. And then you refuse to engage in a 'low level' discussion and ask people to not check your 'facts'? Yeah, I could see why someone in your position would be inconvenienced by in-depth discussion and fact-checking...

Any argument as to whether Israel should(or shouldn't exist for that matter) is futile as the geography of the world is largely shaped by the injustices of the past, whats important is that the present is as fair as possible and such injustices never happen again, however palestineans in my opinion are still being treated very badly, this is the real problem here.

Zionism was originally secular, and most Jews are secular and do not actually believe literally that they deserve the land because God promised it, but Jews have been the most persecuted people of the last two millenia and desired a nation of their very own. is that so bad?

Doesn't it also say that secular people should be killed/will go to hell
Doesn't sound very peaceful to me. perhaps its Jews that should be hating Muslims?
 
 
my origional point was not supposed to be historical or scientific it was an example as to how no one race can not claim land as theres for any other reason than the fact that they are currently living on it. I find it hard to believe there isn't at least one palestinean(remember palestineans are'nt technically arabs but a mix of all kinds of people that lived in that area) that doesn't have a drop of that blood by some means or another. If that is the case, i put it to you that palestineans have more claim to land than jews.
remember, im not pro palestinean, or pro israeli, im pro justice. you seem to be getting into petty semantics and spouting historical facts that frankly prove nothing other than that you seem to be able to justify any act no matter horrid to yourself.

At the end of the day your point is correct, I KNOW NOTHING, and yet ive raised points which although vague and require little knowledge to make have put everything you have quoted on this thread into irrelevance.
 
 
WHAT THE ****, ive not actually stated that any one group has claim to that land, my whole point is that the historical facts uve raised(and anyone else for that matter, both pro jew or pro palestinean) mean very little when you consider the primitive peoples that lived there before jews and arabs, primitive peoples who almost certainly have decendants living all over the world. When you consider that point, The more obvious it seems that any claim jews have to the holy land is purely religious and seeing as im not a jew...i can't say i agree with it

You are right, Palestinians and Palestine is not the homeland of muslims only but the homland of all religions. There are Jewish,Chrisitian and Muslim Palestinians. Our existence is not tied to Islam or any other religion. On the contrary, Israel is the homeland of jews, the flag has the star of David, the legal symbol etc....
 
 
I think it is not worth replying to you, you are too close minded. You refuse to see the picture. There are jewish Palestinians but small numbers. Muslims make up 95% of the Palestinian population but we still don't proclaim ourselves as a muslim nation. Our institutions represent all Palestinians without the involvement or reference to the majority's religion. You just said 20% of the Israeli population are muslims and still all governmental institutions have references to the jewish religion.

Just pure hypocracy.

Believe it or not, theologians are not the only ones who study Middle Eastern history. Shouldn't be hard to track down a credible source explaining the region's history.

 

yes but once again you are spouting historical babble that has no standing with me, my point from the start has been that the jews of three thousand years were NOT the first people to walk the earth or tht region of the world and thus any connection between them and israelis is irrelevant when it comes to justifying jewish claim to palestine. At the end of the day there is no right or wrong on this is issue as its already happened and hopefully no one sees the destruction of israel or mass deportation of palestineans as a credible solution to the problem. I'm simply questioning references to history as a justification for stealing peoples land in the present.
 
 
"nation" well the nation only exists because it was made on the assumption that jews had a right to the holyland. Isn't it more important to you who is living there NOW? native americans might claim america as theirs, but im sure americans don't see the expulsion of white americans so that native americans can have a state/nation as a realistic to soltution to that hypothetical problem?

Now you're claiming a nation exists because it exists, surely if this is your view all the historical **** you've been posting has been pointless and for absolutely no reason at all.
 
 
We don't and we aren't permitted to. I personally dont hold anything against anyone for such petty reasons such as religious faith, skin colour, gender or sexual orientation. The Islamic view is that they as well as us, are the creations of Allah (swt) and everyone/ everything should be treated with common respect and dignity.
 
 
There's an aura of parsimony and stinginess surrounding the Jewish people. Why is this the case?
 
 
id assume it goes back to the jews being traditionally into the money lending business, as christians weren't allowed to do the job.

From personal experience and from what I've heard, Jewish people are less likely to lend you money than people from other religions. Or could this perhaps be a Jewish-culture thing, whereby (some) Jew's are inherently tight-fisted?

Back in my high school days, I remember this Jewish kid who always used to purchase 10p packet of crisps, I mean always. He also used to pick up coppers from the ground. Mind you, this kid was stinking rich.

Back in the summer, I remember these 4 Muslim guys who blew-up the London transport system, I mean killing and maiming dozens. Mind you, they were apparently following their duty.

Wow, amazing what you can get away with if you're not right-wing.  

so what if the kid bought 10p packs of crisps - those pickled onion Space Raiders ones are really nice, I generally buy them. Not because of the price, but because they're nice.

And coppers off the ground? so what? I think it's called being 'humble' and not a total snob, mate. Money is money - I sure as hell would prefer to pick up 500 pennies over a couple of months than work for an hour to earn it. And I sure as hell am not a jew.
 
 
There is evidence for this sort of assertion, it's the same throughout history.

The Merchant of Venice shows just how far back it goes.

That statement is completely understandable given the sudden proliferation of Islamic terrorists.

Likewise with the aura of parsimony surrounding Jewish people.

Search "Jews" + "Stingy" on google and you'd be surprised at the results it shows.

Com'on man, stop acting like it's your first time you've come across the association between Jews and money.
 
 
Sikhs do tend to have an aura of wearing turbans about them...
 
 
Ferrus has an aura of inanity about him.
 
 
Are you seriously trying to establish that there is some sort of basis to the 'Jews are stingy' idea simply because it has been around a long time and lots of people say it? Backed up by a single example you can produce of one Jew who liked a certain type of crisps?
Pathetic.

Ever heard of the concept of 'stereotype?'
As with the 'stingy' issue - let me sort a couple of things out lest some people get confused.

Firstly:-

 
Sterotype: to categorize individuals or groups according to an oversimplified standardized image or idea
 

Hence - a generalisation and thus, inaccurate.

Secondly: -
Common Sterotypes surrounding the Jews (and are therefore untrue)
1) Stingy/Miserly
2) Hunchback
3) Hooked nose
4) Devils horns on head/devils tail
5) Rich
6) Sacrifice Christian babies around Passover time

There we go! All crystally clear  
 
 
You've just proved Dimez right. There IS a conception as the Jews being stingy.
 
 
theres a lot to be said for stereotypes......i.e they usually exist for reasons other than the small mindedness.

Yes they exist for other reasons.
Misinformation.
Stupidity.
History.
Media.
Social fashion.
- doesn't mean they're correct though.

I could give you many stereotypes of other races/religions/ethnicities that do not hold water. It tends to be the ill-educated and unintelligent that believe them though.

hmmmm, i believe that was my point, stereotypes are generalisations largely based on facts otherwise they simply wouldn't exist. I might suggest that all citizens of mexico have apples for heads, this stereotype will clearly not catch on....as mexicans clearly do NOT have apples for heads.

I think that shows that he does believe it to be true.
 
 
i.e that at some point in history a large proportion of said demograph did in fact conform to the stereotype. In this particular case of jews and stinginess, i was not particularly aware of the link and had never really heard of jews having a reputation for being tight fisted, however i believe its foolish to dismiss such stereotypes as they inevitably will have their origins in some kind of truth
 
 
Scienceboi - according to what you said I can therefore conclude (from looking at your A-level subjects) that you are wild-haired, mad, wears a stained dirty labcoat, smells of chemicals, friendless, a loser, a geek without a life, a nerd, stinky breath and yellow teeth, and mutters incoherently to yourself?

I refuse to dismiss such sterotypes as listed above because they 'inevitably' MUST have some origins in truth - so how much of that describes you?  
 
 
I studied the history of Islam last term, and the lecturer mentioned something about a jewish widow poisoning Mohammed for beheading her husband, as he would not convert.

However, she also said this is a traditional belief only based on stories passed down in a certain group of Muslims (can't remember which, sorry).

Although it's been said before.
 
 
Jews may be tight fisted, but they're usually the most successful people in society (Demographically). That's true in America, not sure about here. The Chinese are another group.
 
 
all imigrant groups tend to be stingy and frugle, because of the way their parents live/d, and they appreciate money more. But I am fifth generation and not stingy at all, I think you'll find that 2nd generation muslims from India in this country are pretty stingy
 
 
5th gen Jewish that is
 
 
yeh thats what I meant, thought it would be obvious...

oh come on... YOUR holy text contains references to how Jews will hide behind stones and trees and the trees will tell the Muslims 'come kill me' - that is why its hard to convince non-muslims who have read the Quran that Islam is peace-loving and tolerant

No, the Qur'an does not contain the references to which you refer; it's the Hadiths (Sayings of the Prophet (PBUH), albeit some are fabricated) that do.

The Qur'an is tolerant, go read it for yourself.

The reason behind her endeavour was definitely not because the Prophet (PBUH) killed the widow's husband because the Prophet did no such thing. The Qur'an explicitly states that religion should not be inculcated by compulsion and the Prophet (PBUH) would never contravene that law.

Jews and Christians have the flexibility to do that, they can dismiss and disbelieve the elements of the Torah and Talmud which are just as foul, if not more so than the quotes from the Hadiths that Bizzy posted, BUT Muslims don't have the flexibility.

Why go all         ? And look at the SOURCE for the hadith..."The Times"...tehy are anti-Islamic...so it could be fabricated. Also...who is Mr. Fitzgerald? And the fighting is "predicted"? They are fighting in Palestine...so the prediction must be true.
 
 
thats just ridiculous... are you questioning the credibility of the Times newspaper? You shouldnt assume this is the case because your local Imam/youth leader told you so. Anyway, the only point being made is that the Hadith says this... something you accepted already

I don't claim to know my religion inside-out, after all, I'm no Scholar on the matter.

(particuarly belief system wise)
 
 
Because that's what religion does. When you create something more valuable than people as the primary point of life of course it's going to negatively affect people.

Not necessarily.
I'd say that most religions, if practiced properly actually bring positive effects - look at Buddism and the Dalai Lama - no-one can say that he has negatively affected people - he's absolutely incredible!

Furthermore, many actually bring benefits - for example, one of the fundamental aspects of Judaism preaches 'Do unto others what you would want done to yourself' and we are encouraged to do acts of kindness and give charity etc.
Its only the extremists that manage to negatively affect others lives and unfortunately they give all followers of whatever religion a bad name.

Of course it can be aruged - everything can br argued one way or the other.   Excuse me being pedantic.

On a serious note now.
I cannot speak for other religions, but within Judaism the extremists quite often are not honest to the original text as is shown through their actions, i.e. harming other people - they in fact go against everything we stand for.

If you give me specific examples and show how they are being 'honest to the original texts' I'll tell you how they're wrong - unless your comment was merely out to provoke an angry rebuttal and wasn't a real question?

And extremists are the natural outcome of religion. Has happened with every mainstream religion.

True.

However I would argue that the extremists tend to be a very small minority and the good done by the rest of the 'normal' followers of the religion more than outweigh the idiocy of the extremists.
 
 
Use of the word "Good" is misleading. I believe that religion promotes a "second-best" alternative to actually believing in yourself.
 
 
Charity?

Giving the mentally disabled jobs of their own and providing them with an income and protection from the outside world where they'd sink?

Funds to pay and subsidise people to go to school/get married where they cannot afford to do it themselves?

Emphasising the importance of the family unit and ensuring that a support network exists to help as many as possible?

Communities that willingly house strangers and provide meals and an atmosphere for travellers who would otherwise be left on their own?

- That is 'good' and is not provided for by merely 'believing in yourself'. Self-confidence and self-belief is all very well and indeed, is extremely important, but others need to be cared for as well as just yourself. What happens to those that do not have belief in theirself? Do we leave them to sink or help them to swim?
If we did not have religion we'd all be so wrapped up in ourselves that the plight of those less able would be forgotten.

It was actually directed at no texts in particular, but rather, as has been argued by both Christian and Muslim fundamentalists, that those who are seen as "moderate" are actually watering down the religion with Western style liberalism. In some ways they may have a point - the Bible condemns many things that liberal christians see fit to accept, such as homosexuality, and of course even the fundamentalists seem to ignore the laws regarding usury.

Firstly - None of those I would consider necessarily good, because all of those things have other consequenes, the effects of which can't be measured.

Also, you presume that without religion no one would care about each other. You honestly believe in an entirely secularist society people would be left out to die on the streets?

Giving charity and helping those unable to help themselves isn't good?  

Honestly - yes I believe that. Human nature is essentially selfish and would quite merrily leave others out in the cold (both literally and metaphorically speaking). Look at the undeveloped countries - struggling to survive - and indeed, in many cases only cling on by their fingertips due to help given by the West and donations made by varying organisations. A completely secularist society would see the vast gulf between the rich and poor/able and disabled/etc. increase even more.
 
 
I Am Not A Little Fool.
 
 
from my experience of living in the middle east, most muslims dislike Jews, and they're not quite sure why. they know it has something vaguely to do with palestine...but then they all go off to watch seinfeld or eat a bagel  
 
 
i think i should also add that it's primarily arab muslims that have problems with Jews. the large muslim communities in india, malaysia, phillipines etc. really couldn't care less.

I would say its the religious fanaticism, social disorder, oil dependency and unaccountable governance. I don't see generalisations as a particular big problem.
 
 
Because of Israel, before that they got on fairly well for 1000 years or so.
