 
 
The Fantasy Fantasy A2K NFL Pick-Um Thread for 2011-2012
 
 
For the past half dozen or more years, we have had a game on A2K where we pick the winners in each week's NFL games. Kickycan started it and then I ran it except for the year JPB in Chicago took over. We had a mere 6 players or so the 1st year but got to something like 24 last year.
Most of us know nothing about football, but that was no obstacle. We had a player named Coin Toss/Coin Toss who flipped,unsurprisingly, coins.
We are ready to go for another season, set to begin in a few months. We have players from Mexico through the U.S. and Canada, and over to Europe. And we welcome new participants.
All we are missing is the NFL and the players. I don't follow it closely, but there is a labor dispute that has caused the players to go on strike or maybe the owners locked out the players.
In any event the season appears to be in doubt, although I think that both sides will come to the realization that no NFL will be bad for both sides.
Watch this space.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I am betting that this season will be a major loss. There are many money disputes that, at present, seem irreconcilable, alas.
 
 
@farmerman,

I'm slightly following the madness that is the conflict between the Owners and the Players. They have recently been close to agreement but then some owners balked. I get this all confused with what is happening with the Dodger ownership.
Kidding, I don't really confuse them, but the situations sort of blend together if I don't blink my eyelids for a bit.
 
 
@farmerman,

For a couple of minutes, I thought you meant money disputes between a2kers who played last year Fantasy Fantasy A2K NFL Pick-Um.

Nevermind.  
 
 
@farmerman,

The negotiation talks are closer now then they had been, but it was at a stand-still before. I had heard that the discussions (besides issues like whether or not they'll have an 18-game season and less pre-season games) revolves around the splitting of the revenue-sharing of $9b USD.

Allegedly the owners are offering 44.5% to the players and the players want 48%). I can't imagine theyd let this Ã¡ll drag on beyond the end of the month. Do they really want to kill the goose that laid the golden egg? How greedy can these millionaires players and billionaire owners be?

Osso: I know what you mean about confusion with McCourts case. It's all about poor judgement and greed.
 
 
@Ragman,

Plus the divorce agreement seems wacky given the situation. Well, we'll see what Selig does.

hopefully cooler heads will prevail.
both sides stand to lo$e a great deal if they don't play this year...
 
 
@jespah,

 
If so, who's the guy puking at the bottom?
 

Nominations?
 
 
@George,

I would vote for Spendius. As I recall the Brit won the thing the year before last despite loathing the game. He didn't want to play last year but I goaded him into trying to defend his title. He came close but someone else won.
Spendi is certainly welcome to play again, of course, but I would see him as the puker.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Tuesday night, Hines Ward later added another title upon Super Bowl, he defeated the actor Christie Ellis and Chelsea Kane, a "Dancing with the Stars" TV show 12 season championship.
Program judges Kelly Ann said afte Ward and partner Kim Johnson end the show,: "You are the 12 championship season, you not only dance well, and well versed in how to bring dance to your heart Dance. "Ward said after the game, their victory thanks to partners, efforts and fans, he said: " The competition is very intense from the start, we know the final result is on the ballot, so we have to to thank the fans. "

Watch this space.

 

So, we are a month and a half on and the owner's and player's seem to have come to an agreement on how to divide the zillion dollars of
revenue. All of the fans who declared that never, never again would they watch the NFL will hear the siren song. Big guys slamming into each other once a week. Folks with Pabst Blue Ribbons sitting on couches, including me. I'll be cheering for Pittsburgh, even though I have never been there. Steelers.
Our game here on A2K consists of picking the winners in the NFL games each of the 17 or so weeks. This will be our 6th or 7th season. Sports is not at all big on A2K, so I have structured this as a very simple game where knowledge of the NFL is not at all necessary to be successful.
There is no registration required. There are some rules, but I forget what they are (which tells you something about how seriously we take this). If you might be interested, please let me know so I can assign you a column on my decidedly low-tech score card.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I'm interested.
And will watch the 49'ers with a jaundiced eye.
 
 
just got a note from JetBlue that the season is on

It's on!

(and I still have less than one clue about the NFL - I'm a CFL gal)
 
 
let's do this...
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I'll be there!
 
 
@CowDoc,

 

almost ready

 

ahhhhhhhh

 
 
 
@ehBeth,

 
 
 
are those beef jerky goalposts?
i like to think they are...

and a twinkie faceade -- smart idea, due to their incredibly long shelf life...
 
 
@Region Philbis,

yes and yes

(I posted the link at FB in case you need one for later - build it now - it'll still be fine for the SB)
 
 
The NFL season begins in just a month (Thursday, September 8th). All the animosity between owners, players and fans seems to be behind us.
So to review the game here on A2K. Each week we post the games that often start on a Thursday and end on the following Monday. I used to do that on Tuesday, but in recent years I do it on Sundays for the benefit of folks who actually work and often travel between Tuesday and Thursday - as opposed to those of us who lull about building mock stadiums out of twinkies and beef jerky.
All you have to do is pick the winner in the games posted. You can change your picks in any game up until the start of the 1st game of each week. You also have to predict the final score in the last game of the week. I use that as the tiebreaker in determining the winner for the week.
We keep track of folks' cumulative scores for the season and eventually get to a winner for the season.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Here is the schedule for Week #1 to show you the format:
Thursday, September 8th:
New Orleans @ Green Bay
Sunday, September 11th:
Atlanta @ Chicago
Philadelphia @ St Louis
Detroit @ Tampa Bay
Tennessee @ Jacksonville
Indianapolis @ Houston
Cincinnati @ Cleveland
Buffalo @ Kansas City
Pittsburgh @ Baltimore
NY Giants @ Washington
Minnesota @ San Diego
Carolina @ Arizona
Seattle @ San Francisco
Dallas @ NY Jets
Monday, September 12th:
New England @ Miami
Oakland @ Denver (+ final score)

You can post your picks in any format, such as NO, Atl, Phil...or you can take the time to explain your choices. Or trash talk.
Remember that you can change your picks, so there is no penalty for picking early.
There are some other rules, but I will get into them once I remember what they are.
 
 
@ehBeth,

What's your FB site, ehBeth? I'd like to see what that thing's made of!
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 

I'll give the rest of my Week #1 picks later.
 
 
@CowDoc,

CowDoc -  click here for instructions on making the GREATEST SNACK FOOD STADIUM EVER by the lads at holytaco 

the ingredients

@realjohnboy,

I'll be starting off with the Green Bay Bugswatters
 
 
@ehBeth,

I'll probably start off with the San Francisco Hapless Wonders plus fifteen other teams to be named before September 8th.
 
 
@ehBeth,

Eek I am gaining just looking at that.
 
 
@ehBeth,

Brrrpo!
 
 
@panzade,

Maybe you could be on paper towel detail?

 
 
 
I already have my first three picks.
Any guesses?
 
 
@ehBeth,

 
 
 
@George,

I'm not paying attention yet, sucked as I am into a golf vortex, which I admit is a funny idea.
 
 
@George,

 
I already have my first three picks.
Any guesses?
 

BenJarvus Green-Ellis... followed by Gostkowski and then Gronkowski.

Or maybe you reverse the order of picks #2 and #3.
 
 
@Ticomaya,

Good guess, but wrong thread.
This is for picking the games.
 
 
@George,

I say you're going for Washington, Dallas and New England as your starter pack.
 
 
@ehBeth,

Yep.
I'm sooooo predictable.
 
 
@George,

Oh...

Nevermind.

 
 
 
@Ticomaya,

If I post here at all you already know what I'm gonna say, right?

Well, just to make it official:

 
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Thursday, September 8th:
Green Bay
Sunday, September 11th:
Chicago
Philadelphia
Detroit
Tennessee
Indianapolis
Cleveland
Kansas City
Pittsburgh
NY Giants
San Diego
Arizona
Seattle
Dallas
Monday, September 12th:
New England
Denver (17-28)

May change, I haven't even begun looking at who is where yet...
 
 
@sozobe,

 
If I post here at all you already know what I'm gonna say, right?

Well, just to make it official:

 

 

ARRGGGHHH!!! Back! Back, you fiend!

 
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I am here?
 
 
@Miz Cowdoc,

You are here. Not in that other thread, but here.
 
 
@Ticomaya,

Are you sure??? Things are so foggy here...Oh it is just old age...never mind
 
 
@Miz Cowdoc,

She thought she'd try to be Lamont Cranston, with the power to cloud men's minds. Sadly, she only figured out how to cloud her own.

Setting the stage:

@realjohnboy,

I have to figure out a new system.
I will cogitate for a bit and be back.
 
 
@George,

I'm still cogitating.
What I remember is - the first bunch of weeks are a crapshoot. Which means to me that I should find myself some dice. Or a quarter to toss.

Meantime, I may be forced to choose against the San Francisco Turnstiles. On the other hand, the Seahawks aren't impressing me.
 
 
@ossobuco,

 
... Which means to me that I should find myself some dice.
Or a quarter to toss...
 

Those are as good as any system I'm likely to come with.

Oops I haven't picked yet.

New Orleans @ Green Bay GB
Atlanta @ Chicago ATL

@ossobuco,

 
I should find myself some dice. Or a quarter to toss.

 

I got a rather blistering message today from CoinToss/CoinToss regarding your post, Osso. CT/CT (I never caught the need for the redundancy) flips coins to pick winners and resents your usurping the strategy. CT/CT joined mid-year last season and will play all of this year.
The reference to dice was particularly offensive. You may as well use Tarot cards or cow pooping bingo.
CT/CT tells me that the coin today was a quarter issued honoring the
Palmetto state of South Carolina. The picks are:
GB, Atl, Phil, Det, TN, Hou, Cle, Buff, Pitt. Wash, Minn, AZ, SF, Dal, Mia, Den.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

maybe its redundancy is related to the titling of this thread?
 
 
@Rockhead,

Could be. Could be. Even someone like CT/CT, who I thought was my friend, mocks me. Mocks me.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Sure. I'll have to rethink. I fear I didn't think of CT/CT's feelings.
Well, you could understand that, couldn't you?

I suppose now that I'll have to look for omens.

I've never liked omens.

I guess I'll have to buy some white bread and make toast..
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Since I don't know a damned thing about how rosters have changed since last year:

Green Bay
Chicago
Philadelphia

New Orleans
Chicago
Philadelphia

Pittsburgh
NY Giants
San Diego
Arizona
Seattle
NY Jets
New England
Denver 24-14
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Happy New Season all.

I had decided not to play this year because it is too easy leaving a bunch of Yanks toiling in the rear but Johnnie has invited me and I'm a very polite sort of person who never refuses an invitation without a good reason and it being a piece of cake is not all that embarrassing when I come to think it through.

So here goes

Green Bay
Atlanta
Philadelphia
Tampa Bay
Jacksonville
Houston
Clevland
Kansas City
Baltimore
NY Giants
San Diego
Arizona
San Francisco
NY Jets
New England
Denver. 28--17.
 
 
@spendius,

I can't see how Coin Toss can avoid coming to 50/50, give or take a small statistical error, over 270 or so games and thus is a complete waste of time. The more seasons CT is operated over the stupider it gets because the more games there are the closer to 50/50 it gets. And 50/50 won't win this game.
 
 
@spendius,

blah... blah... blah

Looking forward to kicking your ass this year!

That's the spirit Tico.
 
 
@spendius,

 
I can't see how Coin Toss can avoid coming to 50/50, and thus is a complete waste of time.

 

I wont speak to how Coin Toss/Coin Toss might respond to the "complete waste of time" charge. CT/CT fantasizes about beating the odds someday in the same way that buyers of lottery tickets get to dream about someday beating odds that are a lot worse than 50/50.
Perhaps you are referring to my wasting time on CT/CT. Could be, but you should realize that I have to fill a couple hours of airtime a week for the next 4 or 5 months. I encourage trash talking, which you are pretty adept at.
Thanks for playing along.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

My picks for week #1:
Green Bay
Chicago
St Louis (gasp)
Detroit
Tenn
Houston
Cleveland
Buffalo (gasp)
Baltimore
Washington
San Diego
Arizona
Seattle
NY Jets
New England
Denver (30-20)
 
 
@realjohnboy,

A week away almost to the hour from the 1st game...which should be a good one - New Orleans @ Green Bay.
8 players in so far. I looked back to see how they had done in {Year 6} and [Year 7]. I think I got my years straight; this is #8.
Spendius {1} and [1] is clearly the player to beat.
After that, in no particular order, is JohnBoy {4} [11]; Osso {12} [7]; Jespah {24} [21]; Mysteryman {21} [15]; Tico {12} [15]; McGentrix {2} [10], Cowdoc {11} [11].
I have 12 other players committed to play, I think, and I am chasing a few others.
We have, alas, no new players. That surprises and disappoints me.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Errrrr, what does 4, 11 mean, or 12, 7, or 24, 21?
 
 
@ossobuco,

In {2009-2010} you finished in {12th}. In [2010-2011] you improved to [7th] amongst the players.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
AND WE ARE OFF! Remember that picks for all games - plus the final score in the Oakland @ Denver game are due by kickoff of the Thursday, September 8th game.

Football seasonal greetings to all! Sure am glad all over that the NFL season started on time.

Mulling things over.
 
 
Excellent, Ragman. I had you on my nag list for tomorrow.
Ragman is good at this, finishing in 7th place in 2009-2010 and in 3rd in 2010-2011.
Edgar, who posted his picks earlier did not finish close to the top, but maybe this will be his year to shine.
If anyone has seen Liontamerx and Lmur, please let them know I am looking for them.
 
 
Your title for this thread fooled me. I thought it was one of those fantasy football things. That's why it took your invitation to get me here.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

(the use of both {curvy} and [straight] brackets is duly noted and appreciated...)
 
 
Green Bay

San Francisco

@realjohnboy,

I don't want to be thought picky Johnnie or getting up anybody's nose, apart from Tico's, but why don't you use the same thread every season. As soon as you activate the new season it would appear on all our My Posts and you wouldn't need to go to all the trouble of looking for us. And we could use it to report on close season shenanigans.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Thanks, RJB. I think I've been doing this for about 5 years. FWIW, not that it means a thing, I also had a first place and/or a second place finish a few yrs back when we're 18 players.
 
 
@spendius,

Thanks, Spendius, for the suggestion. The idea never occurred to me!
 
 
You may want to assess your status at any given time by checking
The George Line
If you are at or below the George Line, you are in deep doo-doo.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I like the way it is. A little more welcoming to new faces (should they decide to play).
 
 
@ossobuco,

 
I like the way it is.
 

You old stick-in-the-mud conservative you!

Have you a reason apart from wanting to disagree with me osso?
 
 
@spendius,

Snort! Yes, the reason I stated, which you didn't quote.

Y'know, Spendi, I remember agreeing with you from time to time.
 
 
@ossobuco,

 
Y'know, Spendi, I remember agreeing with you from time to time.

 

Osso and Spendius disagree on 5 out of 16 games in Week #1.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I meant about other stuff.

I've already changed two games on my "football thoughts" notes. Just waiting to see how I settle.
 
 
@ossobuco,

 
Y'know, Spendi, I remember agreeing with you from time to time.
 

Yeah--through gritted teeth.

Y'know, 0sso, I did think of not playing this year and pming you my selections so you could win.
 
 
@spendius,

No, sweets, when I agree, I just say so. I remember agreeing with you on one of the brit riots (whatever you call them) threads. You didn't notice.

On your selections, thanks anyway. I figure we have different bases for our choices, yours related to bookmaking knowledge and natural smarts, mine to a mix of analysis about teams and hunch at the moment I type, with bias for some teams on the side. So, no, you have to stay and see if I beat you this year..
 
 
@ossobuco,

I would have noticed osso.

I hope you do beat me.
 
 
@spendius,

RJB, time for me to switch from Washington Redskins to New York Giants.
 
 
No Manning in week one.

 
Before Sunday night, we had assumed that Colts quarterback Peyton Manning would have been listed on the league-mandated Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday injury report as being a limited participant in practice. Then, he would have been listed as questionable for Sunday. Then, we all would have learned at some point on Sunday morning whether Manning or Kerry Collins would get the start.

The Colts have taken a dramatically different course, announcing on Monday that Manning wonât practice this week, and that he likely will be listed as doubtful for Sundayâs game.  More

These are my changes based on further review.
 
 
Ah yes, another year. Another chance to prove how little I know about the NFL. If nothing else, I have learned that I should stay far, far away from picking Carolina more than a couple times. And SF does not impress me either. Oh well, here's to finishing higher than I did last year. Good luck everyone.

Thanks. Welcome back for a new year, CoastalRat.
I am up to date on additions and changes.
 
 
@JPB,

 
No Manning in week one.
 

Bah.
 
 
@Ticomaya,

...or week #2...etc.
 
 
@Ragman,

I believe that Region is missing a pick in one game and Ragman is short a couple. And, with 24 hours until the Saints @ Packers kickoff, I am hopeful we can have a few other players join us here.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

(psst -- check out the 6th post on this page...)
 
 
@Region Philbis,

Thanks. I missed that.
 
 
@Ragman,

Rather than confuse myself, I'll just repost the whole sheet with my current picks. ( I'll kick around the Ravens-Steelers pick a bit more, but for now I'll leave it this way ):

More picks to follow RBJ
 
 
@realjohnboy,

There are 20 players in so far, with Ragman owing me a couple of games. JPB said she might play and Sozobe picked Green Bay. I am not sure she intends to go beyond that.
15 of us have Green Bay tomorrow night while 5 have New Orleans.
We would be happy to welcome new players. All you have to do is predict the winners in the 16 games spanning tomorrow night through Monday night.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

done
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
AND WE ARE OFF! Remember that picks for all games - plus the final score in the Oakland @ Denver game are due by kickoff of the Thursday, September 8th game.

@realjohnboy,

This timeframe for submission (as you have worded it) seems to be a new change. Prior to this season it was only the Thursday nightgame pick is 'due' before game-time... not ALL the picks. Is this just my misintrepetation or is it a mistake or neither?
 
 
@Ragman,

Thank you for asking about that, Ragman.
I recall that in the "old days" when we had only a handful of players, I would post the schedule on the Tuesday after the Monday night game and players had to pick ALL of the games for the week, even if it started with a Thursday night game. That was a very short window for folks who travel mid-week.
I tried two alternatives as we got more and more players.
1) I would post the next week's schedule on Sunday of the previous week, with ALL picks due by the kick-off of the Thursday game.
2) I would post the next week's schedule on Sunday or Tuesday with the requirement that players had to pick in the Thursday game before kick-off but could come back to pick the rest of the games before the start of Sunday's games.
I prefer option #1 for several reasons, but I can certainly live with #2.
But the season starts tomorrow night. There has been plenty of time to mull. All picks for week #1 are due by kick-off tomorrow night.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I have no problem with either option. I just wanted to clarify it myself because I'd seen no prior discussion of that. Perhaps I missed that thread. However, whatever makes it easier for you I'm all for.
 
 
@Ragman,

 
...or week #2...etc.
 

Double "bah"... etc.
 
 
@Ticomaya,

his 227 consecutive start streak is second to brent's 297, among QB 's...

 
Colts left tackle Anthony Castonzo was 10 years old when Manning's streak began. Veteran center Jeff Saturday
has never snapped the ball to another quarterback to start a game during his pro career. In fact, no player on
Indy's roster has participated in a regular-season or playoff game for the Colts without No. 18 at the controls.
 
 (espn) 
 
 
@Region Philbis,

I hear that Obama consults him directly on every move he makes.
 
 
@Region Philbis,

Brent Musberger has that kind of streak going? who-da-thunk it?
 
 
I am changing my pick from Seattle to San Francisco
 
 
@Ticomaya,

Peyton Manning had his more invasive neck surgery today to free up his nerve problem. It sounds like it'll be 2-3 months minimum before he can pick up a football again. Looks to many that this looks he's done playing this season.

It's a bummer cause I really like watching him play. And NFL likes him playing too.

2 and a half hours until the kickoff of the NFL season!
In the New Orleans @ Green Bay game we break 15-6 in picking the Packers.
As I look through the games for Week #1, we are evenly split on the Detroit @ Tampa Bay game.
There are 3 games where we are at 19-2. Edgar and AndyClubber pick Miami over NE and Carolina on top of Arizona. Jespah and Ms Cowdoc think Minnesota will beat San Diego.
Osso (choosing Oakland) and McGentrix (Jax) agree with the majority on all but one game. Tico, Ragman and Fbaezer are out of step on 2 games.
At the other end is Edgar who thinks differently from the majority on 9 of 16 games and Wandeljw at 7 of 16.
There is still time for new players to join in for the full week experience. Hurry, hurry, hurry.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Thanks, RJB! Your assessments of our picks keeps things interesting.
 
 
@wandeljw,

Killing A Bit Of Time
You may recall that AndyClubber is an employee of mine who is the singer in a goth-type band. They are on their annual month long national tour.
He writes well and has been blogging periodically. They dodged hurricane Irene in the NE, losing 1 show in Cambridge. They made it to Atlanta where they performed and Andy was on a few panel discussions at some event. Then they drove through the brunt of the remnants of hurricane Lee.
They spent last night in Beaumont, TX and headed today to a show in Austin. He describes the fog of smoke as absolutely surreal.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Thanks for the clue - I forgot there was a game tonight. Was keyed in to the US tennis open today instead. (go.... Rafa)

Interesting re Andy's experience. Yeah, the smoke. Very weird and scary. The old Bel Air fire came six block from our house. Ours and many others. Ai yi yi.
 
 
@ossobuco,

GB gets a quick TD.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Umm... this game is shaping up to be ugly for the Saints. They're marching through them like crap goes through the Xmas Goose.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

And another.
 
 
RANDALL COBB!! WOO! Loved the Lambeau Leap and the TD Leap that preceded it.
 
 
Great game.
For the life of me...why send in a rookie running back on the last play when you have Sproles?
 
 
@panzade,

I've always liked Sproles (picked him one year in Ffootball) and he was fantastic last night in a variety of roles. The choice of Mark Ingram seems, at least in retrospect, so obvious to Green Bay, re his publicity.
 
 
@ossobuco,

There might have been an attempt at double-fakeout -- the Saints are known for their inventive play-calling, so they figured the Packers would assume that, and the straightforward play would be the surprise.

Dunno.

I like the result though.  
 
 
@sozobe,

True, and me too.
 
 
@ossobuco,

I didn't stay up to watch the game's end. A lot of points scored.
I made a big thing about the need for players to get their picks for all of the games in by the kick-off of the 1st game (NO @ GB).
That is sort of not true. Players can still pick the remaining games by the start of Sunday's games. Regardless of how well a new player does, however, he/she will not be eligible to win the prize for the week.
So if you meant to pick but never got around to it, you are still welcome to join us and compete for the trophy awarded at the end of the regular season.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

What trophy? I never saw any trophy.
 
 
@spendius,

I (sputter) mailed them to you. I never have trusted British Post agents.

@edgarblythe,

It depends....how many tickets will be available by the time they are eliminated?
 
 
Coin Toss/Coin Toss is so flipping excited! After picking Green Bay, CT/CT agrees with the majority of the folks here on 7 of the 8 early games this afternoon.
Take that, Spendius.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

That make no difference Johnnie. CT will end up where I said after nearly 300 games.

I'm all excited. Our first game in about 90 minutes is the Steelers/Ravens and at 9.00 the Giants/Redskins. Break open the Jumbo popcorn and the 6-pack.
 
 
@spendius,

Spendius: You should try to explain that to CT, who believes you are wrong, rather than to me. NFL games, evolution vs creationism, global warming or not, CT has an opinion.
I mess with CT's head though with something like "boxers, briefs or nothing?"
I did get the views here on this thread from 1859 to 1878 with one mindless post. That is my job.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

them buffalo boys are putting an oldtime ass whoopin' on the chefs.

I hadda turn the radio to something else in the shop.

their sadness was overwhelming me...
 
 
Osso (sand dogs) not doing well so far. So many bad guesses..
 
 
By my count, Region is 7 of 9. George and Johnboy are 6 of 9.
Liontamerx, 2 of 9, is, um, 2 of 9.
 
 
So..... the Packers beat the Saints and the Bears beat the Falcons. Gonna be an interesting year in the NFC Central.
 
 
The Steelers made me glad I have a second favorite team today. Texans did real good.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
NFL games, evolution vs creationism?
 

I would say there is a compromise. The male courtship display of evolution in terms of force and cunning is evident but so also are the rules which tone down the expression of them.

The female response is symbolised by the cheerleaders and that is also toned down.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

May be I should start watching some football....I think I am only 3 to the good.
 
 
As near as I can tell, George, Region and Johnboy are left in contention for the Week 1 prize, with a win by Dallas giving the week to George.
Very unofficial, though.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
...I did get the views here on this thread from 1859 to 1878 with one mindless post. That is my job.
 

I had no idea the Internet had been around so long.
{runs}
 
 
@jespah,

Issues of Harper's Weekly between 1859 to 1878 have been archived. RJB has found a unique resource for football predictions.
 
 
Two games left in week #1. I have the contest coming down to a race between Region and Johnboy who are tied at 11-3. Both have New England over Miami and Denver against Oakland. George is at 10-4 but also has NE and Denver. He can gain no ground. Six players are 9-5 but none of them has both Miami AND Oakland.
In the tiebreaker game (Denver vs Oakland) Johnboy sees the final score as 30-20 while Region predicts 31-21. I will have to find the rules on how the tiebreaker works.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

so when the fish win, nobody gets hurt.

that's good...
 
 
@Rockhead,

 
so when the fish win, nobody gets hurt...
 

Yeah, whenever that is.
 
 
@Rockhead,

Only Edgar and Andy swim with the fishes tonight.
 
 
The rules regarding the tiebreaker:
1) The player closest to the winning team's score in the last game
2) The player closest to the losing team's score
3) The player closest to the home team's score
4) The player closest to the losing team's score
5) The player closest to the total points scored
6) The player who is lowest ranked in the standings

Region sees a final score of 31-21 Denver while Johnboy is at 30-20 Denver.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
Region sees a final score of 31-21 Denver while Johnboy is at 30-20 Denver.

Weak #1:
We fared pretty badly as a group. Bad. We finished with a 56.5% winning record (190-146). Last season we came in at 61% or so.
Here are the standings after our 1st attempt at this:
(1) Region (12-4)
(1) Johnboy (12-4)
(3) George (11-5)
(3) Fbaezer (11-5)
(3) Best ESPN guy (11-5)
(5) Cowdoc (10-6)
(5) Ragman (10-6)
(5) McGentrix (10-6)
(5) Wandeljw (10-6)
(5) Spendius (10-6)
(5) Osso (10-6)

(11) Mysteryman (9-7)
(11) JPB (9-7)
(11) Rhys (9-7)
(14) Edgar (8-8)
(14) Ms Cowdoc (8-8)
(14) Worst ESPN guy (8-8)
(14) CoinToss/CoinToss (8-8)

(16) AndyClubber (7-9)
(16) CoastalRat (7-9)
(16) Liontamerx (7-9)
(16) Jespah (7-9)
(16) Tico (7-9)
(21) Edgar (6-10)

Using the 1st tiebreaker (player closest to the winning team's score), Region gets to paste a gold star to his forehead for winning Week #1 over Johnboy.
A bit of clarification on the tiebreaker that I used. Oakland beat Denver 23-20. Region predicted that Oakland would lose (21-31) while Johnboy said Oakland would fall (20-30). We both had Denver, but that doesn't matter. Region with a guess of 21 was closer to the winning team's score.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

(21) Edgar (6-10)
 

Do we really have 2 players named Edgar?
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I include a deliberate mistake periodically to see if anyone is watching.
(14) EhBeth (8-8). Not Edgar.
Thanks for the correction. I suspect there will be many others needed.

@Region Philbis,

I'm not convinced there should be a tie-breaker. A tie is okay. It gives two the thrill of winning. The Irish St Leger last Saturday was a dead heat and the connections of both horses were as over the moon as if they had won outright.

I notice that Coin Toss was 8-8 as is to be expected. And that Tico flunked again.
 
 
@spendius,

What will it cost to get the Seahawks outfit to Pittsburg?
 
 
@spendius,

 
I notice that Coin Toss was 8-8 as is to be expected. And that Tico flunked again.
 

But I shall persevere and overcome.... and still kick your ass!
 
 
@Ticomaya,

Well Tico--the ball's in the back of the net for 1-0.

For those readers who don't know Tico actually plays football our way. And he's a stalwart of the defence. Alas, I can no longer play myself, it being the limits of my stamina to get to the pub and back, but when I did I was in what opposing teams need to be defended from.

Hence we are psychologically opposite. But all in the friendly spirit of sporting gentlemen of course.

In American football I would be a wide receiver and Tico would be among the grunts.

Did you make picks in Week 1, Pan? I might have missed them. Please let me know. Thanks.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

@panzade,

Damn. I am really sorry. I never saw that. You went 10-6 which wasn't too bad and leaves you in a 6 way tie for 5th with everyone below that dropping one notch.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Geez - If I drop any more notches I will disappear.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

No worries mate. This thing is a bundle of yarn to run. You do it well.
 
 
CoinToss/CoinToss is eager to participate and to aggravate Spendius - who claims that CT/CT will always end up at about 50-50. Something about statistics. My problem is that I am not as good at flipping coins as I used to be. Actually, they flip decently but I am not very good at catching them anymore. The coins disappear to be found only when I run over them with the vacuum cleaner.
So, as a new feature here at no additional cost, you - yes you - can be CoinToss/CoinToss for the week! How cool is that?
Rules (yes, there are rules. I love rules):
1) You must be the 1st to declare that you will be making CT/CT's picks.
2) You must describe in detail the coin you are using.
3) You must post CT/CT's picks with any narrative - which is expected - being gender neutral. That is tougher then it seems, I assure you.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
I have emails out to Rhys and to Andy, who performs tonight in Scottsdale, AZ, before hitting CA this weekend. Half way through their tour.
 

Where tonight in Scottsdale, may I ask?
 
 
@Ticomaya,

His website says:
Wednesday. September 14th
Chasers Nightclub
8005 East Roosevelt St
Scottsville AZ 85257

If that is in your area, I think you would enjoy the show. It is not outrageously loud. I have never been to any live Bella Morte show, but Andy is a good singer (trained in, believe it, opera). The music, somewhat goth, is a bit dark. He has an incredible stage presence, I hear.
It is too late for me to get you in for free, but if you go mention that you are in our football pick-um game and he will likely give you some free merch.
Tell him that you are both 7-9 in Week #1 and that you have Pitt in Week #2.

I think that might be the same place he played last year (maybe the year before)... which is like on the complete other side of town from me.
 
 
@Ticomaya,

So you live in Snobsdale eh? That explains a lot.
 
 
@George,

 
After a quick trip through the wormhole and back,
I find that you were right the first time.

Are you sure of your coordinates?
 

I thought I was sure. Hopefully I didn't jump ahead several weeks. Dang, now I'm gonna have to go forward again. And you know what I pain that can be.

"Welcome to Texas"
The band had 2 days off and stayed at the home of friends in San Antonio. They slept, Andy (a fitness freak) ran a lot, they ate well for a change, and slept some more.
Jordan, the drummer, took a shower and went outside to call his mom. He sat on the curb in front of the house. Two police cars pulled up with lights flashing. The police didn't buy his explanation of why he was there and he admits that after he got a bit snippy about having to spread eagle against a car, he got cuffed. His ID was in the house, but the police were not particularly interested in pursuing that. They wanted to know why his hair was wet (shower?) and why he wasn't wearing shoes. Why wasn't he wearing shoes, they asked repeatedly.
Finally Jordon and the police came to the door and asked for the other folks to find Jordon's ID. They couldn't find it so eventually one of the policemen came in and Jordon was able to produce it and he was set free. The policeman snarled "Welcome to Texas" on the way out the door.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Y'all come back now, y'hear?
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Oy vey. Wet hair and no shoes, that is always a sign of a trouble causer...

One of the things I've gotten rid of in life is a hair dryer. It'll dry on its own.

I may face up to the responsibility of choosing my teams for the week today.
Or, tomorrow.

@spendius,

 
So you live in Snobsdale eh? That explains a lot.
 

What does it explain?
 
 
@Ticomaya,

Why you're so snooty with anybody you can't patronise. It's obvious you are one well-heeled dude who believes it's due to your own superior talents.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

It's a long way, artistically, from that rather odd story to the Sex Pistols John.
 
 
@spendius,

 
Why you're so snooty with anybody you can't patronise. It's obvious you are one well-heeled dude who believes it's due to your own superior talents.
 

I take exception to that.

I can patronize anybody I want.
 
 
@Ticomaya,

... and in any case, I was snooty WELL before I moved to Arizona a few years ago.

But it's an interesting observation from you, and it's given me pause... is it your upbringing that shapes you, or is your make-up more a function of the municipality where you live?

I don't know what town you live in, Spendi, otherwise I could search to see if it has a reputation for rearing drunken misogynists.
 
 
@Ticomaya,

It has in the sense you mean misogynist. But it's a strange term Tico and you should beware of using it. It can be turned round on you. It simply makes a claim to know the best way to handle women and usually turns out to be the way that best suits men.

Uxoriousness is invariably just a method. A manipulation.

But Auberon Waugh, of blessed memory, did say that the more a dinner guest spoke of his honesty the faster they counted the spoons.

The question of what causes one to be as one is is not one that is easily answered. I'm not sure if it ever can be. A lot of people make a nice living out of trying to answer it. I wonder what caused them to get like that.
 
 
@spendius,

I have no idea to what dictionary you are referring, but just to be clear, this is the meaning I ascribe to the term:  MISOGYNIST .

I was once accused by a member of this forum of being a misogynist, merely because of the avatar I have chosen. I think it's far better to be accused because of the city you live in.

@Ragman,

I've made 2 revisions. Please change the following picks:

Chicago over NO Saints
Urlacher is playing and the team will rally big-time

Phildelphia Eagles over Atlanta Falcons
Falcons have not shown the have a solid D
 
 
@Ticomaya,

Well Tico--I am quite confident that the women I have known would never have guessed that I hate women. I have no need to even order my beer when I walk in the pub. All the barmaids start pumping it as soon as they see me. Last night in fact my pint was ready on the bar as Stephanie had seen me approaching through the window.

Dictionaries are a bit crude by necessity. They haven't the space for nuance and there's enough of that in this subject to fill millions of books.
 
 
@spendius,

Barmaids are not dumb. They must figure you're one of their regular customers and you're more manageable when drunk. They are also being paid to show you proper service. I bet they even laugh at your jokes.
 
 
what the hell happened to the football?

if I wanted a bizarre infomercial, I'd go here...
 http://able2know.org/topic/176268-1 
 
 
@Ticomaya,

QB Kolb was good in his opening win, but they're pretty shakey in the Red Zone (last wk's performance in 2nd qtr on 6 yd line). Skins QB Grossman seems to be clicking. Should be an interesting game, nonetheless.
 
 
Still 48 hours until Sunday's games and we have 16 players in. I am missing Osso, Spendius, Rhys, JPB, Liontamerx and MsCowdoc a long with a few games that EhBeth needs to pick in.
 
 
@Rockhead,

 
what the hell happened to the football?
 

Johnnie encourages "trash talk" in between the games.
 
 
@Ticomaya,

I've been to Scottsdale, back when a friend got married in that area. Went through Wright's Biltmore Hotel, liked it.

Don't know where in the Phoenix area the Cardinals have their stadium, to get back to football.
 
 
@ossobuco,

i believe they play in glendale, AZ...
 
 
@spendius,

That's because you pay them money... and quite a bit of it from the sound of it.

 
 
 
@Region Philbis,

That's right... over on the west side... where all the little people live.

Welcome to a2k, Coin.

I live on the west side. Bad decision, as it happens. Not to get serious.

Don't despair, I will post my picks, once I figure them out, and then you can worry.

I will post the schedule for this week in a bit. The deadline for picking all of the games is tomorrow at 1 pm ET.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

@ossobuco,

Uh oh. Am I too late?
EDIT - suddenly I got spooked and thought there was a Sat night game.
No, so, whew!
Will study a bit more, so don't write these with a diamond engraving tool yet, RJ.

Week #2:
Kansas City @ Detroit
Oakland @ Buffalo

Chicago @ New Orleans

Jacksonville @ NY Jets
Seattle @ Pittsburgh
Arizona @ Washington
Green Bay @ Carolina
Dallas @ San Francisco

@ossobuco,

Ok, the only one I'll change is that I'll pick the NYJets over Jacksonville.
 
 
Plenty of time left to mull over your picks, Osso. I had intended to write about our picks for the week tonight but my back is hurting. I will be horizontal soon.
Meanwhile, in college football, schools are jumping from conferences to conferences (ACC, SEC, Big Ten etc) in a quest for bigger payoffs from television revenues. The colleges call the players "student-athletes."
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I could change from New Orleans to Chicago, but I won't. Sometimes my biases win out over what I read.

Bad back? Dagnabbit, I hate that. (I wrench mine a few times a year, always the same place. Less bad than it used to be.) Be well, kid.
 
 
22 players x 16 games = 352 picks.
In our Week #1 debut we, as a group, agreed with the majority 57% of the time. This week we are up to 80%.
There are no games in Week #2 in which we are unanimous. Spendius has KC while the rest of us are partial to Detroit and Jespah is the only player picking Tennessee. Jespah and Tico have Carolina over Green Bay; Edgar and Coastal see a win by San Diego over NE and George and Rhys think/hope that St Louis will be the NY Giants.
The Cleveland @ Indianapolis game is a toss up with the Colts getting the nod 12-10.
Cowdoc agrees with the majority on every game. Mysteryman (who chooses Oakland), McGentrix (Tampa Bay), Liontamerx and AndyClubber (Cleveland) are out of step on just 1 game.
Rhys, meanwhile, is at the other end, differing the majority on 8, I say 8, games. Jespah follows at 7.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Thanks for the analysis. As an admitted propeller-head, I am fascinated by it.
 
 
@Ragman,

Some of the first ten games were a little hair raising..
 
 
I have Osso and Pansade at 9-1.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

maybe that's why you couldn't find Panzade before, jb...
 
 
@ossobuco,

Congrats on the Tampa Bay pick osso. Good call.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Jespah's Tennessee pick was awesome.
 
 
@ossobuco,

Unreal! I actually had to watch the Buffalo-Oakland and skins-cards game to the end.
 
 
@ossobuco,

Wow! You're 9-1, Osso? Not that I should be surprised.
 
 
@Ragman,

I'll make up for it with the next six..
 
 
@ossobuco,

Arrrgh..Cowboys are killing me. I'll never pick them to win again this year. They suck..and badly..at that!
 
 
@Ragman,

Same here, and I have been untrue to my preferred team, the 49ers. Oh, the woe.
 
 
@ossobuco,

Well, I won't bet against my Pats...that's fo sho!
 
 
@Ragman,

Your Pats have a better record lately than my 49'ers.. I'm waiting patiently for Colin Kaepernick to mature as the QB.
 
 
Big Vince Wilfork intercepts Rivers.
Freakin hilarious!
 
 
@George,

Betch'ya Rivers didn't think so!

'Niners are a young team with a bright future, I think.
 
 
@Ragman,

Good turn for SF. Interception and a quick TD.
 
 
If they take a break when a player is "slow to get up" and they get paid from the ads in the break is there a possibility that some players are "slow to get up" on purpose?

I'm fed up with our footballers getting accused of faking injury.
 
 
@spendius,

 
I'm fed up with our footballers getting accused of faking injury.
 

Then perhaps you should get them to stop faking injury.
 
 
@Ticomaya,

hahaah!

Dive, dive, dive!
 
 
@Ragman,

Meanwhile, Eagles with an improved lead.. but still 3rd quarter.

Urgggh - I spoke too soon.
 
 
Panzade, at 13-2 and with a pick of the NYG over St Louis, will win Week #2. Five players are 12-3 and all have the Giants.

WEEK #2-
Panzade had an excellent week, going 14-2 and winning the coveted forehead gold star thing. A bunch of players finished at 13-3: Osso, JPB, McGentrix, Liontamerx and AndyClubber. Ragman and Cowdoc came in at 12-4 while Tico, Mysteryman, George and Johnboy were at 11-5. Spendius, Region, Edgar, Ehbeth, Fbaezer and Coastalrat ended the week at 10-6. Rhys, Wandeljw and Ms Cowdoc broke even at 8-8 while Jespah stumbled again this week at 7-9.
The ESPN experts had a good week with the best of the bunch at 14-2 while the worst managed a 12-4. CoinToss/CoinToss finished in last place at 6-10.
As a group we were 238-114 (.676) which was better than the.568 we recorded in Week #1.
 
 
@fbaezer,

Romo suffered a broken rib and a collapsed lung in a gutsy victory over the 49ers.
More worrisome is the injury to Miles Austin, though he may play on Monday night.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Thanks for the gold star thing jb, though I've already misplaced it.
It was a big payday at work where the u-pickem game had 29 contestants at 5 bucks a pop.
You guessed it. I collected the filthy lucre.
 
 
STANDINGS AFTER WEEK #2:
1) Panzade (.750) climbs from 5th in Week #1
2) Johnboy (.719) slips from a tie for 1st
2) Osso jumps from 5th
2) McGentrix does the same
5) JPB (.687) gets a big bounce from 12th
5) Region slumps from 1st
5) George drops from 3rd
5) Ragman holds onto a share of 5th
5) Cowdoc matches that
10) Fbaezer (.656) loses 7 spots from 3rd
11) Spendius (.625) slides from 5th
11) AndyClubber pops up from 17th
11) Liontamerx does that also
11) Mysterman inches down from 12th
15) Wandeljw (.562) stumbles from 5th
15) Tico moves up from 17th
15) Ehbeth remains where she was
18) Rhys (.531) declines from 12th
18) Coastalrat loses a step from 17th
20) Ms Cowdoc (.500) suffers another 8-8 week and drops from 15tt
20) Edgar moves out of the cellar
22) Jespah (.437) moves into the cellar from 17th
The best ESPN guy is.750, good for a share of 1st while the worst expert (.625) lands in a tie for 11th. CoinToss/CoinToss also is at the bottom, keeping Jespah company.
As a group through 2 weeks we have a.622 winning record.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Congratulations to Panzade - great score.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
11) Spendius (.625) slides from 5th....
15) Wandeljw (.562) stumbles from 5th

@realjohnboy,

John-Boy is known as "Roget" in some circles.
 
 
@George,

crop circles?
 
 
@George,

Is that in a letter to the Thessaronians?

(groan)

So, I have a starter list, which might as the week goes by change a smidge.

I wrote this up yesterday, early for me:

Lions at Vikings LIONS
Broncos at Titans TITANS
49s at Bengals 49ERS
Texans at Saints SAINTS
Giants at Eagles EAGLES
Dolphins at Browns BROWNS
Jaguars at Panthers PANTHERS
Patriots at Bills PATRIOTS
Ravens at Rams RAVENS
Chiefs at Chargers CHARGERS
Jets at Raiders JETS
Falcons at Bucs FALCONS
Packers at Bears PACKERS
Cardinals at Seahawks CARDINALS
Steelers at Colts STEELERS
Redskins at Cowboys REDSKINS

Today I'll give points to the Redskins/Cowboys - 27 to 24.
I like, as it seems many do, Kafka, but not sure how much practice he's gotten, and am glad Romo did his thing, but figure he'll still hurt some; don't particularly believe in Grossman. So, it's Washington by a hair.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Well, I appreciated the nuance. Spendius only "slid" from 5th to 11th. My drop from 5th to 18th was a "stumble." This is definitely the work of an expert wordsmith!  
 
 
@wandeljw,

5th to 15th was a "stumble." 5th to 18th would have been a "plummet."

Thanks for the correction. I actually dropped to 15th, not 18th. RJB used precise terminology, as always.

I'm a-thinkin, john boy.
Jeez, will Romo and Vick play?
 
 
@panzade,

I think Romo will, but the 'Skins defense has been trash talking about hitting him hard. Not sure about Vick. Concussions are being taken much more seriously then in the past.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Correct me if I'm wrong, but last year I remember the Packers' Rogers having to sit out a game after a concussion; like it was mandatory.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I think Vick will play.

Perhaps not wise to do it.
 
 
@ossobuco,

I have exhausted my knowledge about football.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I probably have too.
 
 
@ossobuco,

All you need to know osso is that it is a bunch of blokes trying to impress women with their toughness, stamina and cunning.
 
 
@spendius,

Well, that's the way of sports, eh? Remember, I'm interested in piazzas, where bull baiting and bareback horseracing got a footing long ago.
 
 
@ossobuco,

I did see today, though, that the NFL is intending to impose rather severe penalties on teams who have their players take lessons from soccer players who fake injuries to stop the clock.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

free corner kick...?

Sounds good to me..

Sofitel cleaning maids might be better.

Our footballers, when they do fake being injured, which is rare, do it to run the clock out, to get the player who tackled them in the ref's bad books and to give the other 21 players on the field a rest, which they often need.

Policemen are notorious for it in order to get 6 weeks paid sick leave. Six months for some.

@realjohnboy,

CoinToss/CoinToss got assistance in Week #2 from another player here. It did not turn out well. Would anyone like to take a turn at it this week?

 
CoinToss/CoinToss is eager to participate and to aggravate Spendius - who claims that CT/CT will always end up at about 50-50. Something about statistics. My problem is that I am not as good at flipping coins as I used to be. Actually, they flip decently but I am not very good at catching them anymore. The coins disappear to be found only when I run over them with the vacuum cleaner.
So, as a new feature here at no additional cost, you - yes you - can be CoinToss/CoinToss for the week! How cool is that?
Rules (yes, there are rules. I love rules):
1) You must be the 1st to declare that you will be making CT/CT's picks.
2) You must describe in detail the coin you are using.
3) You must post CT/CT's picks with any narrative - which is expected - being gender neutral. That is tougher then it seems, I assure you.

 
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I have some free time on my hands this weekend, jb.

is cointoss allowed to talk smack...?
 
 
@realjohnboy,

It's a waste of time John. CT will finish last on here. It's a sure thing. Do you know any bookies who will offer evens it doesn't.

CT/CT would love to talk trash. You can use your own name or Ehbeth, who created CT's identity here, can provide us with a password to talk in CT's own voice.
 
 
I see, Ms Cowdoc, that there are some pretty big swings in the temps in Salmon (altitude 4300 ft). Mild days and chilly nights.

@George,

I have a slight california bias, plus I like the coach, Hue Jackson.
Obviously this doesn't always win out in my pick-um considerations, as I chose again not to pick the 49ers in a similar choice. If I rue that, that might be good news for the team. (hang in there, Kaepernick (sp)
 
 
@realjohnboy,

howdy footballers.

checking the stash here in my locker.

trying to find a quarter. a real one, not one of those canadian ones...

I think I smell back bacon.

anyways, on to the flipping.

first up:
Houston. even flipped it again to make sure. yep...
Phlly. (it was a george face coin)
Carolina (even coin-toss know Jax sux)
Buffalo (whoa Nellie)
Miami (honest injun)
Niners (any arrests in cincinatti yet)
Donkeys (nuff said)
Detroit (I feel alexish)

Bollymore (quoth the raven, nevermore)
Raidahs (lingering foot fetish?)
Bolts (chef's special)
Birds (the red ones)
Tamper Bay (wild card fever)
Been Gray (no bears)

Steelers (RIP colts)

cowgirls 23-21

now I gotta hunt for all the quarters that hit the floor and rolled under stuff.

this is trickier than it looks...
 
 
@Coin-Toss,

Good work, Coin.
 
 
@ossobuco,

But how does CT determine the tie-breaker score?
 
 
@CowDoc,

if he gets to the tie-breaker phase, as a group y'all might be better suited to another game...
 
 
@Rockhead,

 
if he gets to the tie-breaker phase...

 

You violated the gender-neutral rule, Rockhead, re CoinToss/CoinToss.
Choose your words carefully, please.
And CT doesn't attempt to guess the final score but anyone around the 50-50 mark shouldn't really care. Right?
 
 
@realjohnboy,

we're sorry...

I have to admit. I helped with the final score bit...
 
 
mebbe we should refer to CT as Pat.

as in point after attempt, not patsy or patriot...
 
 
@Rockhead,

Speaking of PAT, did anyone see how badly Toledo got screwed at Syracuse?
 
 
We are right around where we were last week, with around 80% of us agreeing with each other overall.
We have several tossups, though. We are 12-10 in favor of SF vs Cincy as well as Atlanta over TB and Washington against Dallas.
We are unanimous in selecting San Diego facing KC. Jespah is alone in choosing Seattle and Indy to triumph over Arizona and Pittsburgh, respectively. Jespah and Ms Cowdoc have Minnesota over Detroit and Ms C and McGentrix like St Louis against Baltimore.
Cowdoc agrees with the majority on 15 of 16 games (he has Denver) followed by five of us with 14 of 16.
Jespah disagrees with the majority on 7 - gasp, 7 - games, followed by Tico at 6.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Go... Jespah!
 
 
Ready for some football? There isn't much else to do in central Virginia today as we have yet another in a series of days of drizzle with more to come. In our family, this is called Hungry Mother weather. We have had 6.5" of rain in September so far vs a 4.5" September average.
I see that the Yankees and the Red Sox are supposed to play a double header in NY today as the Bo-boys work on blowing their lead in baseball.
We have 8 early games here - starting right about now!

Coin Toss has a funny first name for a boy. Must be a Brit.
 
 
@Coin-Toss,

hahahahaha

ask the fella who did the first round here - I owed him change by the end
 
 
@ehBeth,

CT is a female.
 
 
@spendius,

am not...

I am genderless.
 
 
@spendius,

are you watching the games at your pub?

if so, toss one back for me, eh...
 
 
@Coin-Toss,

I'm watching the Eagles game.
 
 
@spendius,

I'm watching the red sox and yankees.

and the rays and jays.

I think by the end of the day, they may need my services to decide a wild card representative...
 
 
Things are not going well for the Sand Dogs here - I'm winning only one out of eight, and that one not by much. Maybe I'll shoot for a perfect blank score.
 
 
@ossobuco,

iteresting...unusual even.

all of the early games are deep in the 4th quarter, and could still go either way.
 
 
@Coin-Toss,

Buffalonians must be going out of their minds by now..
 
 
Check the highlights on that Houston TD.
 
 
@edgarblythe,

Find myself rooting for McNabb..
 
 
@ossobuco,

 
Find myself rooting for McNabb..

 

He's still in football?
 
 
@edgarblythe,

he's the new Bert Farve.
 
 
@ossobuco,

I know two people from the Buffalo area - one, my friend Sharon who I claimed on the Can We Talk, Boss thread was from the Bronx and I had misremembered - no, it was Buffalo - - - and Kicky. That game with NE is hard to describe.
 
 
@ossobuco,

Why isn't Buffalo going for a field goal at this point? Well, I suppose NE can still get a td in a short time, but hey..
 
 
@ossobuco,

Kicky's from Rochester.
 
 
@ossobuco,

OK, then! Oops, I picked NE.
 
 
@ossobuco,

they are inflicting maximum pain to the Belichick...
 
 
@ehBeth,

Oh, well, I seem to batting poorly on places people are from..
 
 
and...

it's buffalo by a nose.
 
 
<scream of anguish>
 
 
@George,

you watching the sox game, too...?

I am a model of consistency.

straight up 50% through the early round...
 
 
@edgarblythe,

Yes. Had a tough time with the coaches in Washington.. now w/the Vikings, as Coin Toss said.

Sigh, I jumped to 4 out of 8. Just like games of chance.
 
 
@Coin-Toss,

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh

 
 
 
@ehBeth,

I'll have to check with rjb...

I don't think I am allowed to drink while in character.
 
 
@ehBeth,

Well, SF 9'rs won despite my doubts - let me tip a glass of irish coffee from the BV (Buena Vista) in their honor.

 http://www.thebuenavista.com/irishcoffee.html 
 
 
The eight early games are over and we have several players - including CT/CT - at 4-4. Jespah is at 3-5.
Congrats to Wandlejw for threading the wicket* at 8-0. Johnboy is bucketing the drainspout* at 7-1.

* In week #6 we have our "talk like a Brit" contest.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
Congrats to Wandlejw for threading the wicket* at 8-0. Johnboy is bucketing the drainspout* at 7-1.
 

Keep an eye on the Bears-Packers game, RJB. I picked the Bears and you picked the mighty Packers.
 
 
@ossobuco,

I have you at 5-3, Osso. Please check on that.
 
 
The Texans had plenty of chances -
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I will. I posted a selection on the early end of this week, and then some changes.
Have to go back and look at the list with the changes. I fear I'm correct.
 
 
@ossobuco,

Ok, you're right, nice! - when I posted, Detroit hadn't won yet.
 
 
@edgarblythe,

That would have been fun for me as a neutral fan to be at that kind of game. A bit rough on the Saints fans, even though they won.
 
 
@Ragman,

The Texans have more improving to do, but it is obvious they are much better than other seasons - Hope they don't fall apart after I write this.
 
 
Blimey--that Bears TD eh. The tight end evaded three tackles all of which he wouldn't have done in our rugby and then the tackle that got him down was in the EZ and too late. But it looked good I must admit.

Are we having our legs pulled or what? Some of the tacking in the Eagles game was woeful.
 
 
@ossobuco,

 
Well, SF 9'rs won despite my doubts - let me tip a glass of irish coffee from the BV (Buena Vista) in their honor.

Hey I actually had Irish coffee there!
 
 
@George,

Me too, once. Something of a tourist spot but loved past that. Hans took me there in.. (shock) 1971.

There's a whole thing about the glasses, recently resolved, re getting the manufacturer to gear up again and make more. Big hubbaballoo in the SF Chronicle pages. Apparently the glasses' shape matters to the extreme re the perfection of the drink.
 
 
Tough week to be favored. I'm lucky to be at 9-5
 
 
@JPB,

I have you at 8-6, JPB. Did I err?
 
 
By my accounting, Week #3 will come down to Wandeljw vs RealJohnBoy. Each is at 11-3 and have Pittsburgh tonight. Johnboy has the Skins tomorrow night while Wandeljw has the Cowboys. George is 10-4 and has the Steelers. He can not win the week.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I think I'm 8-6 as well, but it's better than the Miz!
 
 
@CowDoc,

Wahhh...I'm 9-5, according to my records!

I had been really eying the Raiders - NYJets game as THE one I really wanted to switch. Had I done so, it still wouldn't have helped me. My Pats let me down.

Pats...please stay away from the Red Sox and Fenway.  
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Nope, you're right. I credited Arizona with a win that they didn't get.
 
 
@ossobuco,

 
... Apparently the glasses' shape matters to the extreme re the perfection
of the drink.
 
Dontcha love it? I've got beer glasses in four different shapes. Each one
for a different kind of beer. I can mix and match to a fare-thee-well and
never taste the difference.
 
 
Hmm. I doubt the Steelers can count on going to the Superbowl, this year.
 
 
@George,

I read all the reasons the glasses were so good, convincing while I read it.
That all did make some sense. Based on what I read, I could see their point.

Alas, I forget. You know me, flittering a2ker.
 
 
It's scandalous that the cheer leaders are not given the sort of coverage that they very obviously deserve. In one shot at the Eagles game a player with a sore hand was shown walking past the cheer leaders who were shaking their tassles, kicking their legs and wiggling their jahangas and he never even glanced at them. The camera was trained on his ugly mug and these fine ladies were going past as if they were on a platform at a railway station.

Talk about misogyny.
 
 
@spendius,

There were four blokes in the studio during the game last night whose job it is the rabbit expertly about football and e-mails idiots have sent in whilst you are been shown adverts that go on longer than our TV companies are allowed to do.

Three of them were very wide black guys. One was a soft-looking Limey.

One of them was introduced as "Junior Head Coach" which is an odd title.

The main man took about three hours to say "Aaaaaaaaand weeeeeeeeeaal neoooow haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand baaaack toooooo the cooooooommmeeeeeeenntaaaaaaaaaaairy teeeeeam iiiiin Pliiiiiiiiiiiiiiiilaaaaaaadeeeelphiiiiiiiiiaaayye. You could have took a nap.

And a player was discussed, Mr Vick I think, who had had four separate bureaucracies check him out and pass him fit to play. No doubt all the individuals involved had long and imposing titles. We just had to show the coach that we could touch the end of our nose with the forefinger.

What the legal profession has achieved is mind boggling.
 
 
@spendius,

 
... What the legal profession has achieved is mind boggling.
 
That may turn out to be quite literally true in this case.
 
 
@George,

I noticed when the in running scores were going up that one team had scored 2. How does that happen?
 
 
@spendius,

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_  (American_and_Canadian_football_score)

"While safeties are generally worth two points, they are worth one point when they occur during a point-after attempt."
 
 
@Ragman,

Ahem! Would you mind being a bit more specific?
 
 
@spendius,

Ahem: read the link I put from Wikipedia.

"A safety or safety touch is a type of score in American football and Canadian football and is worth two points (with one very rare exception). In American football, it is the only means by which a team not in possession of the football can score points. Analogous to an own goal in other team sports, a safety may occur in a variety of ways, most commonly when an opponent in possession of the football is tackled in his own end zone. "

Safety is how the score of 2 points is/was granted.
 
 
@Ragman,

I read the link and I saw no mention of football. Do you really think I would be so ignorant as to say what I did without reading the link. You have a very low opinion of the two times champion in this Pick-Um game. From two attempts I might add.

I presume the "tackle" to which you refer is more effective than a lot I saw in the Eagles game.

But thanks anyway.
 
 
@spendius,

Beyond my control, the link to the explanation of Safety - American football term topic may have be broken. Nevertheless, I provided an excerpt explaining it. You're quite welcome

By any chance is your name Joey Nickels?

Wandeljw is 12-3 and has Dallas tonight, while Johnboy is also 12-3 and is picking Washington. One of them will win the week outright.
As a group we have the Redskins by a 12-10 margin.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Please switch my pick in tonight's game to Redskins over Dallas.

Gawd help me as I hate switching 'cause I often lose ground...but... so be it.
I just don't buy into Dallas with their key injuries in addition to Romo's. Romo probably won't make it past the first quarter with his injuries. Kitna can't win either. Skins-Cowboys rivalry is big and the division's top spot is at stake.

That makes the vote here 13-9 in favor of the Skins.
 
 
@Ragman,

The rules here require picks for all games in a given week must be submitted before the kickoff of the 1st game (usually 1 pm ET Sunday).
I can explain the logic if asked.
So you are stuck with Dallas. Sorry.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I wasn't aware that you couldn't make a change to the MNF before the game time. No problem, really...OK. You probably did me a favor! LOL.

It makes the job simpler still as the administrator.
 
 
@Ragman,

It also keeps people from being namby pamby with their picks...

I flip my coin with the utmost in confidence that 50 % of the time, I'm going to win. unless I lose...
 
 
@Coin-Toss,

wow, that was kinda harsh, coin toss...
 
 
@Coin-Toss,

That's 'cause you're an edgy sort.
 
 
@Ragman,

That's not as bad as drawing circles up and down the block.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I think I have ten too..
I'll go back and check.
 
 
@Ragman,

Is that the nickle defense?
 
 
@ossobuco,

I have my record at 10 wins, too Hopefully, Mr. Romo can show the world what sort of winning stuff he's been alleged to be made of.
 
 
@ossobuco,

Hats off to you for that one.  
 
 
@Ragman,

a blonde bimbo and a bad tv commercial?
 
 
@ossobuco,

Nope, RJ, I'm wrong, I only have 9.
 
 
@ossobuco,

You both, Osso and Ragman, along with a bunch of other folks, are 10-5. That is not good enough to catch either Wandeljw or Johnboy.
The main reason for the rule mentioned above is that there are (believe it or not) people who make picks and then move on to other things. They don't follow breaking injury reports, for example.
The comment about namby-pamby changing of picks in order to affect the outcomes of a week is also a factor in creating the rule.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Thanks. I managed to confuse myself just now when I counted five negs.
Gotta go back to elementary school.
 
 
I am going to do the schedule for Week #4 tonight as I will have to run the Week #3 tabulating tomorrow. Sometimes if I am confident about the outcome of the Monday night games I will start the exercise on Monday. Not this week!

Redskins up by a TD (16 to 9 if the EP is good) with 4 minutes left in the 3rd Q.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

holy cow.

the redskin defense parted like the red sea, and a fifteen yard penalty hands Romo something other than a goat suit.

6 field goals.

for shame...
 
 
@Rockhead,

ahahahah! Man what a fiasco! If I were Romo I'd sue his receivers and the clown that was SUPPOSED to snap him the football. I'd punch his lights out!
They won it without the benefit of a single TD! I think they said that has never happened on MNF.

Romo may have finally gotten the jones off him. You can't say he's not tough enough nor that hye can't put it ALL on the line without carrying his team to a win in a big game.
 
 
Before anyone congratulates me, I just want to admit that my picks were extremely lucky guesses.  

Thanks for an exciting week, RJB!
 
 
@wandeljw,

Congrats. It's all luck, really. No one has a crystal ball.
 
 
@Ragman,

not true.
i pay this guy to do my picks every week...

 
 
 
Week #3 Results-
We finished the week at 218-134 (.619) which is mid-way from our performance in Week #1 (.578) and #2 (.676). As a group we got hurt by New England losing to Buffalo and Arizona stumbling against Seattle.

Wandeljw (13-3) wins the week with a fine outing, narrowly topping George and Johnboy (12-4). Four players ended at 11-5: CoastalRat, Ragman (whose attempt to switch from Dallas to Washington was denied), Spendious and Osso.
10-6 was a popular finish for 7 players: Rhys, JPB, Mysterman, Tico, EhBeth, Fbaezer and Panzade.
Jespah, Region, Edgar, McGentrix and Cowdoc came in on the plus side at 9-7. Liontamerx and Andy could only manage to break even at 8-8. Ms Cowdoc is not doing very well thus far. She was last at 6-10.
CoinToss/CoinToss is so flippin' excited, going 11-5. The best ESPN guy came in at 11-5 while the worst was just 8-8.
 
 
STANDINGS AFTER 3 WEEKS-
1) Johnboy (.729) claims sole possession of 1st after 3 strong weeks
2) Panzade (.708) falls into a 2nd place tie, a mere one game back
2) Osso holds unto a share of 2nd
2) George climbs from 5th
5) Ragman (.688) holds 5th just one more game back
6) JPB (.667) slips from 5th
6) McGentrix drops from 2nd after a less then stellar week
8) Wandeljw (.646) bounds from 15th
8) Fbaezer creeps up from 1oth
8) Spendius gains three spots from 11th
8) Cowdoc loses three from 5th
8) Region matches that move

13) Mysteryman (.625) leads the middle of the pack, but is down by 2
14) CoastalRat (.583) pops up from 18th
14) Tico advances from 15th
14) EhBeth does the same
14) Andy, after a breakeven week, slumps from 11th
14) Liontamerx has the same result

19) Rhys (.563) gains from 18th
20) Edgar (.521) hangs onto 20th
21) Jespah (.479) gets out of the cellar
22) Ms Cowdoc (.458) moves into the cellar.

CoinToss/CoinToss (.521) is in a tie for 20th. The Best ESPN guy is at.729 which ties him for 1st while the worst expert (.583) is in the group tied for 14th.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

If Ragman takes my title by one you will have to remind him that your strict rules were his guide.
 
 
@wandeljw,

I'll congratulate you anyway - truly great job of guessing.
 
 
@ossobuco,

thanks, osso!
 
 
@spendius,

I'll just provide a 'safety' margin and beat you by 2 points!  
 
 
@Ragman,

I've made my guesses, several of which I don't trust further than I could throw them, which is only about 12" to my Mac monitor. Will let them simmer a bit before posting.

@realjohnboy,

CoinToss/CoinToss had a good week in Week #3, but is still at about 50-50. I am looking for someone here to volunteer to help with the flipping in Week #4.

 
As a new feature here at no additional cost, you - yes you - can be CoinToss/CoinToss for the week! How cool is that?
Rules (yes, there are rules. I love rules):
1) You must be the 1st to declare that you will be making CT/CT's picks.
2) You must describe in detail the coin you are using.
3) You must post CT/CT's picks with any narrative - which is expected - being gender neutral. That is tougher then it seems, I assure you.
Let me know if you are interested.

 
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I agree with on a lot (for now).

I wanna be Coin Toss/ Coin Toss

I'll be using a 10 peso coin:

SUN on one side:

 

EAGLE on the other side:

 

"Ãguila o Sol?", that's the title of one of Nobel Prize winner Octavio Paz's books.

SOL will be visitors; ÃGUILA will be locals.
 
 
@wandeljw,

way to go wand-man... very tough week to win.
 
 
@fbaezer,

I suppose I'll have to drag out some of my ital coins in the future (though you, fb, have more justice in that). I would need quite a bit of practice, and possibly a padded room..
 
 
@fbaezer,

CoinToss/CoinToss starts flippin' the coin for the early Sunday games:

Detroit has the sun on its side.
The coin says "Eagle", Chicago it is.
Pittsburgh and a sunny day.
Jacksonville flies against the bookies' odds.
Cleveland gets the nod of the Eagle coin
Guess what? The Eagles were betrayed by their coin. Sun it was: San Francisco
Kansas City, sayeth the toss.
The Sun has always been friends with the Redskins: Washington
Cincinnati, as the eagle soars on top of the coin.

Here come the late Sunday games:
Atlanta has the sun on its side, no wonder they call the city Hotlanta.
The Eagle has flown: Arizona
Smart coin: Green Bay
As the toss goes, it says New England
Two sunny cities, but it was "Ãguila": San Diego

Sunday night:
No sun on nights: Baltimore

Monday, night:
No sun on nights, i said: Tampa Bay

Does CoinToss/CoinToss have to submit a final score?
 
 
@Coin-Toss,

Oh, great, the coin I'm looking at is L.500, and is inscribed Polizia di Stato --- this is so not me. Nice looking coin though.

Put me in line.

Maybe I can figure out which side is tails.
Well, yeah, repubblica Italia would be heads.

In the coming week, I'll practice flipping.
 
 
I am sorry I wasn't able to access the coin-toss account.
Hope the picks are valid anyway.
 
 
@ossobuco,

 
In the coming weeks, I'll practice flipping.
 

Start slowly osso and gradually build it up.

No, CT doesn't know how to do the final score thing. But CT will most always end up around 50-50 and is unlikely to end up in a tie-breaking situation.
 
 
@fbaezer,

There was a choice, you didn't have to.

Ok, this is nice and odd. Lots of similar lire have no mention of the state police.

Snort.. I'd better not lose this in the dust bunnies.
 
 
@fbaezer,

Sharp compilation, Baez.
 
 
Thanks, Fbaezer, for speaking for CT/CT this week.

@Ragman,

do you have trouble at the check-out lines too?

paper. no wait, umm plastic.
 
 
@Coin-Toss,

hahaha...no...but injury reports are flowing now..so that influences my changes.
 
 
Jespah...you seem to have Buffalo winning twice and Tennessee and Cleveland both winning in the game between them. You left out picks in Carolina @ Chicago and Pitt @ Houston.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

she is still in Bill's shock, jb.

she'll get better as time goes by...
 
 
@realjohnboy,

well, Buffalo DID win twice

I think Jespah should get bonus points for recognizing that in her selections!
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
Jespah...you seem to have Buffalo winning twice and Tennessee and Cleveland both winning in the game between them. You left out picks in Carolina @ Chicago and Pitt @ Houston.
 

Eek, sorry, doing this on the fly. Go Buffalo!  

Tenn for the Tenn-Cle game. Carolina and Houston, too. Does that fix it?

Thanks.
 
 
@jespah,

There is plenty of time yet, and we are just missing picks from Spendius, Rhys, JPB, Cowdoc and AndyClubber.
Andy winds up his band's tour with a show tonight in Ithaca and one tomorrow night in Amityville, NY. The latter was the scene, I am told, of a classic 2005 horror film. Andy, whose music and novels tend to the dark side, should be happy to be there.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I'll remind Rhys this evening.
 
 
@George,

Do that if you want to, George. I emailed him this afternoon with a reminder. I am sure he will respond in due course without nagging from dad.
Andy is in:
Detroit
Chicago
Pittsburgh
New Orleans
Tennessee
Philadelphia
Minnesota
Washington
Buffalo
Atlanta
NY Giants
Green Bay
New England
San Diego
Baltimore
Indianapolis (27-17)
