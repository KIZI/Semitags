Idealistic young president wins Nobel Peace Prize, expands scope of
government.

Monied interests and the lawmakers in their hip pocket fight
back.

Unprecedented national disaster helps to redefine America.

These headlines, though they certainly sound familiar, refer to
events
in the United States soon after the turn of the 20th century.

The national disaster in question is the Big Burn of 1910, the
largest
wildfire in American history, which destroyed trees and whole
cities in
Montana, Idaho and Washington.

When told badly, history can be the driest of reads. When told
well, it
can be compelling.

Fortunately, "The Big Burn: Teddy Roosevelt and the Fire that
Saved
America" falls into the latter category. Timothy Egan, who won a
National Book Award for his account of the Dust Bowl, has done it
again,
with a book that examines the famous fire, the events leading up to
it,
and its legacy.

What jumps out immediately is Egan's mastery of the subject.
Events are
recounted in amazing detail. And the portraits of people, from
Teddy
Roosevelt on down to a salty mountain woman, are multidimensional,
with
the exception of some corrupt Congressmen and robber barons.

The book begins in medias res, with the firestorm descending on
Wallace,
Idaho. Ranger Ed Pulaski of the newly formed U.S. Forest Service
tries
to arrange for the safety of his family. The mayor tries to
organize an
orderly evacuation of women and children that is thwarted when
cowardly
men force their way onto the escape train.

Then the scene shifts to New York, where then-Gov. Roosevelt
meets young
Gifford Pinchot, product of a wealthy Republican family and a
recent
graduate of Yale University's school of forestry. The two share a
love
of the outdoors and forge a common philosophy of conservation that
is
put into practice when Roosevelt is elected president.

Roosevelt creates the Forest Service and puts Pinchot in charge.
In
turn, Pinchot fills the ranks of the fledgling agency with recent
graduates of Yale's forestry program. Among Pinchot's beliefs,
which he
inculcates into his charges, is that forest fires can be
controlled.

Meanwhile, influential congressmen in the pocket of robber
barons who
seek to exploit, rather than preserve, starve the Forest Service by
denying funding for additional rangers and supplies. Nevertheless,
the
army of little g.p.s (nicknamed for their boss' initials) is
deployed
out west.

Then comes the summer of 1910, which sees the elements of the
perfect
firestorm fall into place. There is an unprecedented drought in the
Northwest. It's only a matter of time before sparks from a new
train
line and dry lightning storms touch off an unimaginable inferno
that was
fueled by high winds.

This is where the book really takes off. The heroic battle
Pulaski and
other rangers mount with a relatively few volunteers and Buffalo
Soldiers is in vain. Pulaski and his party are cut off by the fire
and
have to flee to a mining tunnel. Most of his party is saved, but
Pulaski
suffers burns and permanent injuries. Others who fanned out across
the
mountains suffer similar fates. Many die.

Afterwards, questions are raised about whether the rangers
should have
battled such a large blaze. Shamefully, the government pretty much
turns
its back on Pulaski and other rangers and volunteers who need
medical
help after the fire.

But out of the ashes of the Big Burn comes a more pragmatic
policy, a
compromise that allows companies to harvest trees in the national
forests in return for increased funding for the Forest Service.
This is
anathema to Pinchot. But for others, the issue of fire isn't so
clear-cut. And as recent events in California have shown, it's an
issue
that hasn't gone away.
