Ospreys lock Ian Gough received a chance to add to his 63 Wales caps when he was summoned on Monday to replaced injured Cardiff flanker Sam Warburton for the two-test rugby tour of New Zealand.

Warburton broke his jaw during the first half of the 34-31 loss to South Africa on Saturday at Millennium Stadium, though he wasn't replaced until the second half and didn't mention the jaw until after the game. He will be out for four weeks, said Wales physio Mark Davies.

Gough made two appearances from the reserves during the Six Nations. His last start was a year ago against the U.S. in Chicago.

Wales leave on Wednesday for tests against the All Blacks on June 19 and 26.
