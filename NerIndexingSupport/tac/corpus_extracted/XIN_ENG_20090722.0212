Houston Rockets center Yao Ming has underwent successful surgery to repair the
broken bone in his left foot, National Basketball Association website reported
on Wednesday.

The surgery involved a bone graft in the tarsal navicular bone as well as
additional procedures to change the alignment of his foot in order to reduce
stress on the repaired bone.

The surgery was performed by Rockets Team Physician Dr. Tom Clanton with
assistance by Dr. Bill McGarvey at the Memorial Hermann Sports Medicine
Institute located in Houston, TX.

"Everything went according to plan and we were able achieve not only fixation of
the broken bone but also realignment of the bones to improve the stress pattern
on his foot," said Dr. Clanton. "Yao is doing well and resting comfortably after
these procedures. We expect him to be immobilized in a cast and using crutches
for at least 6-8 weeks."

Yao is expected to remain hospitalized for several days. While no timetable has
been set for his return to action, Yao is expected to be available for the
team's training camp in 2010.
