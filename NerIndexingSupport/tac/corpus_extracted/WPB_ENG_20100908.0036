Just before lunch time at Deerfield Correctional Center, 60 men in wheelchairs
stream across the prison courtyard and into the mess hall, followed closely by a
group of inmates hobbling on canes, leaving the blind and the senile to shuffle
inside last.

Not far from this daily migration _ dubbed the "wheelchair brigade" by prison
employees _ are two rooms full of elderly inmates too weak to make it outside.

Deerfield, Virginia's only geriatric prison, is where the state's inmates are
sent to grow old. They're transferred to this facility in Capron, near the North
Carolina border, when they're too weak to stand or feed themselves, when they
don't have much time left.

Since the General Assembly abolished parole for the newly convicted in 1995, the
number of elderly inmates in custody has soared. In 1990, there were 900 inmates
over the age of 50. Now there are more than 5,000. Deerfield Correctional, which
once housed 400 inmates, has become a 1,000-bed facility with a long waiting
list.

"We're left trying to be both a nursing home and a prison," said Keith Davis,
the warden.

Scrambling to handle the surge, the state has built a 57-bed assisted living
facility at Deerfield, with rows of hospital beds filling a room the size of a
high school gymnasium. They've added a special meal for the facility's legion of
diabetics, and they've hired nurses to keep round-the-clock watch on the
infirmary's 16 inmates.

It's an expensive endeavor: It costs $28,800 annually to house an inmate at
Deerfield, compared with the $19,000 it costs at most of the state's medium-
security prisons.

Buddy Francis, 77, sits along the wall of the assisted living unit, in a row
reserved for bedridden inmates. He was sentenced to 52 years for attempted
capital murder. So far, he's served 28.

Francis tries his best to gesticulate as he talks, raising weak arms inches
above his chest. "It don't make sense that they're still keeping me here," he
said. "I'm not going to hurt nobody." He points to his thin legs, barely able to
carry his weight. "I can't hurt nobody."

Under the 1995 Truth in Sentencing law, two types of inmates can still be
paroled: prisoners over 60 and those convicted before the law took effect. That
makes Francis eligible for parole. But since George Allen (R) was elected
governor in 1993 with a promise to abolish parole, offenders have spent
significantly more time behind bars. Fewer than 5 percent of inmates charged
before 1995 have won reprieves since Allen's initiative passed, compared with 42
percent of eligible inmates who were granted parole in the years preceding the
change in law.

Those over 60 face even slimmer odds. Only 15 of 1,000 eligible elderly inmates
have won release.

That record has led to a class-action lawsuit against the state. "The law says
these inmates are eligible for parole, but the Parole Board is acting as if
they're not," said Bill Richardson, an attorney representing 11 inmates.

State officials say the low parole rate reflects the fact that most nonviolent
criminals have been released over the past 14 years, leaving mainly harder-core
criminals behind bars. "These inmates might be old, and they might no longer
pose a threat, but this is the price of committing a heinous crime," said Rick
Kern, director of the Virginia Sentencing Commission, which oversees state
sentencing guidelines.

The trend in Virginia foreshadowed a national trend. Between 1999 and 2007, the
number of inmates 55 or older in state and federal prisons grew 76.9 percent,
from 43,300 to 76,600, according to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics.

Ray Tatum, 73, bedridden and hard of hearing, is one of the few lucid residents
of Deerfield's infirmary. Sentenced to 35 years for murder, Tatum lies
surrounded by buzzing oxygen pumps and cawing inmates, several of whom suffer
from dementia.

"I run this show," Tatum said, smiling.

"Mr. Tatum, remember that you are in prison," replied Dawn Mosena, the infirmary
nurse manager.

To Tatum's right, 86-year-old Aloysius Beyrer rambles incoherently. Pale and
unable to use the bathroom without assistance, he relies on nurses and other
inmates to roll him over so he doesn't get bedsores.

Beyrer, serving a 100-year sentence for rape and aggravated battery, will likely
die in this room.

Those elderly inmates who do win release after decades behind bars find life
outside Deerfield lonely and stressful. "They've outlived their families," said
Mosena, the nurse manager. "They've burned bridges. It's something they ruminate
on for years before they leave."

Some parolees are sent to local nursing homes. Others find long-lost relatives
willing to care for them. And about twice a month, inmates die here _ days,
months or years away from their scheduled release dates.

"We let the families come in, we let them sit on the bed with their loved ones,"
Davis said. "We try to be as respectful as we can."

At moments like that, even the warden doubts the logic of geriatric
incarceration: "You see that kind of human frailty, and it's hard not to
question what we're doing here."

Last month, Tatum got the best news of his life. After three decades, the parole
board made him one of only about 200 prisoners to win a reprieve this year. In
two weeks, he plans to move into his sister's trailer in Baltimore. "The first
thing I'm going to do is eat a huge McDonald's cheeseburger," Tatum said.

For the past year, Daryl Elliott has been Tatum's caregiver. To cut costs,
Deerfield assigns younger inmates to be wheelchair pushers, paying them between
23 and 45 cents an hour to take care of elderly prisoners.

Elliott scrubs Tatum at night and takes him to the recreation yard each day.
There, barbed wire and watchtowers remind them that Deerfield is hardly a
nursing home. "But it sure feels like an old folks' home sometimes," Elliott
said. "At first, it was hard to be surrounded by all this aging and dying."

Even harder for many younger caretakers with long sentences is knowing that
someday they will be the ones bathed and fed and wheeled outside for a few
moments in the sun.

"There was somebody in that bed before, and there's going to be somebody in that
bed after," Elliott said.
