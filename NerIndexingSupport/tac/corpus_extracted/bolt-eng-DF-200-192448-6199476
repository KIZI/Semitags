from wikipedia:

"he King David Hotel bombing (July 22, 1946) was a bombing attack against the British government of Palestine by members of Irgun — a militant Zionist organization, classified as a terrorist organization both by the British authorities and several Jewish organizations, such as the Jewish Agency, Haganah and Histadrut.

The Irgun, dressed as Arabs, exploded a bomb at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, which had been the base for the British Secretariat, the military command and a branch of the Criminal Investigation Division (police). 91 people were killed, most of them staff of the secretariat and the hotel[1]: 28 British, 41 Arab, 17 Jewish, and 5 other. Around 45 people were injured.

The attack was initially ordered by Menachem Begin, the head of the Irgun, who would later become Israeli Prime Minister. The attack was commanded by Yosef Avni and Yisrael Levi."

------------------------------------------------------------

The terrorist attack killed 91 civilians, more than any attack by an arab organization against jews. The leader of that group which carried out the attack became prime minister of israel TWICE not once...

In the meantime, nesrallah, the leader of hezbullah, whos main targets are israeli soldiers, is classified as a terrorist.

Talk about double standards..
 
 
And did anyone claim that Begin wasn't a terrorist? Didn't think so.

Well yes... the Zionists. And WHY was he allowed to become Israeli PM?

I didn't realize being a terrorist excludes one from office. And last time I checked, Begin became PM three decades after stopping using terrorist tactics. Arafat became President almost immediately after ending (public) support for terrorist attacks.

And you're not going to find many people who'll deny that Begin was a terrorist seeing that he called himself such. Then again, "terrorist" wasn't a dirty word until the '80s.

No-one is buying your bull. 3,700+ rockets were fired at Israel by Hezbollah, only a handful struck military targets. Most were aimed at populated civilian centers - Haifa, Kiryat Shemona, etc. aiming to kill as many civilians as possible. This lie that Hezbollah in any way tried to limit it's targeting to Israeli soldiers is completely insupportable and not fooling anyone.
 
 
"Aimed" is a rather strong word to use. From what the news reported, most of the missiles were fired randomly into Haifa, in the certain knowledge that they'd be bound to hit SOMETHING.
 
 
Bump!

There's a huge difference between SA and Israel. On one hand you have a country in deep poverty, with 'massacres' going on every day (similar to the Gaza strip I guess) and on the other you have a semi-superpower.

And Nelson Mandela is greatly respected as the epitome of diplomacy and enabler/facilitator of a peaceful South Africa.

No comparison possible with any former or current Israeli leaders - as far as is observable - since they are still in a constant state of conflict.

And? Would you like to explain how the nature of the countries is relevant? Because it seems awfully like you're trying to draw a false distinction based on something that is not really relevant, nevermind crucial.

Menachem Begin made peace with Egypt, a country with which Israel had been in an essentially continuous state of hostilities for 3 decades - including 4 large-scale wars (1948, 56, 67, 73). The Israel-Egypt peace was one of the biggest, and perhaps the biggest, step fortward in the Israeli-Arab conflict that has ever taken place. Surely that ranks him as both good on diplomacy and facilitating peace with a major former enemy? True, he didn't manage to secure total peace for Israel - but that hardly means that his considerable achievements should be discarded.

"Well, he cured lung cancer, but there are still other types, so I'm not impressed."

That really seems like you're trying to get your rebuttal (a very poor rebuttal) in first. You know as well as I do that Israel has been in conflict on all fronts since the day it was created. 2 of those fronts - Egypt and Jordan, are now essentially peaceful, if not always friendly. Those peaces are major steps forward, so to say that you cannot call some Israeli leaders peace-makers because there is still war elsewhere, is a ridiculous claim.
 
 
Jewish terrorists?

Well I never
 
 
First of all, there is a difference between "Jewish terrorism" and "zionist terrorism". I dont think there has ever been Jewish terrorism in the world(?). In the 1940s, it was the extremist zionists who carried out terrible terrorist attacks, and many Jews all over the world looked on in sadness and horror, just as today many Muslims are saddened by the terrorist acts of some extremists. I think that terrorism of any kind is terrible and uncalled for - whether it be zionist, Muslim or any other. Terrorism of today needs to be dealt with. As far as I am aware, the zionist terrorism which existed in the 1940s does no longer exist, and so is not a problem today.
 
 
My point is.. the world is happy to allow someone who killed so many civilians in cold blooded terrorist attacks, without being provoked, to become a prime minister of a country twice.

However, the world looks at someone else who emerged to resist israeli occupation of south lebanon as a terrorist.

Why? Because the world liked the zionist guy.. because of all the sympathy towards the jews after hitler... but the world doesnt like nesrallah so they label him as a terrorist.

What has nesrallah done more than that israeli PM in terms of terrorist acts? in this whole war.. only around 20-30 israeli civilians died.. in ONE day the jewish terrorist killed 91 people.

Now tell me how is that fair?

Firstly, hardly "without being provoked" - the Arab violence against Jews in the Mandate was fierce and much of the activities of the Irgun, Lehi etc. were geared at providing a Jewish response to such attacks. They did also take anti-British actions, but that was actually secondary as Israel was likely to emerge whatever they did.
Secondly, "the world" does not really have a say in the matter. If Israel wants to elect a Prime Minister who 30 years earlier carried out such actions, they can.

Am I the only one who doesn't see any connection or tangible point in what is being said here? Because there seems to be no rhyme or reason to the mindless drivel that the person above is spouting. He seems to be complaining that Begin became the Israeli PM (30 years after his actions in the Mandate) but that Nasrallah is called a terrorist - and there just doesn't seem to be any connection between the two things that would make one "unfair". There just doesn't seem to be any point to the statements he is making, what the hell is he arguing? That Nasrallah shouldn't be called a terrorist? That the world is unfair because Israel "is allowed" to elect a PM in the late-1970s who took such actions in the 1940's?

The world labelled Begin as a terrorist too, back in the 1940's... You seem to be trying to prove some sort of bias or unfairness where none exists by trying to claim that it's unfair that someone labelled a terrorist could be in power 30 years later whilst another person is being labelled a terrorist - two things that don't seem to be related.

"It's unfair that you call that apple green, because that olive was green and is now black!"
 
 
Ok so would you and your zionist trash friends accept nesrallah as the prime minister of lebanon in 10 or 20 years? Or, would you have accepted Ahmad yaseen, the spiritual leader of jihad whom you murdered in cold blood, to become prime minister of palestine? Umm.. I dont think so.
 
 
The analogy with Nelson Mandela is perfectly valid: both were perceived as terrorists, who were furthering what they perceived to be a worthwhile cause, using occasionally violent means. Nothing wrong with the analogy. George Washington led the United States in treasonous rebellion against George III and they elected him president. The point Jonathan makes is that whatever the state of the said nations, the fact that somebody uses violent means to achieve political objectives does not preclude them from serving their people in political office.

We are not comparing their characters or rectitude. That is irrelevant. In any case, your implicit assumption that Israeli leaders are the sole cause for the perpetuation of the conflict, is debatable.

Well...as zionist trash...in 10-20 years time, let's see what Nasrallah wants to do? if he suddenly declared that he will disband his militia and make peace with israel (obv. a 2-sided peace deal) then i'm sure israel wouldn't have a huge problem with him being PM!

Secondly, who murdered yaseen? me? jonathanH? nop. try again....

Firstly, it's not for me to "accept" him or not - I have no say in the matter. Secondly, would he have stopped the terrorism decades previously and since moved in to mainstream Lebanese politics? If so, he would be more palatable than if not.

Hehe. For those amongst you not familiar with the conflict - Ahmed Yassin was the co-founder and spiritual leader of the terrorist group Hamas and had the blood of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Israelis on his hands. He was to Israel what bin Laden is to the United States. He was assassinated by Israel in 2004.
As for the question - same applies as above. If he stopped the terrorism and became reasonable, ready for proper peace etc.

Yea but the point is... he got what he wanted.. ie THE STATE OF ISRAEL.

and it was never a 2sided deal with the arabs. Infact it was a one sided agression pact sponsored by the brits and americans.

If nesrallah got wut he wanted.. which is nothign in the scale of the creation of a new state and stealing land.. all he wants is withdrawal of israeli forces from shebaa/release of kidnapped prisoners/mine maps.. he would disarm his resistence organization.

Better luck next time.

What are you talking about? Israel was not sponsored by the Americans. America didn't start supporting Israel until the late '60s. Does it really hurt to read some history before making such outrageous claims?

I think you kinda misunderstood wat i said wen i put in parenthesis (obv. a 2-sided peace deal). What i meant was if there were negitiations between nasrallah and israel and there was comrpomise!

In 1948, the zionists compromised massively and ended up with the 'crap' bits of israel (i.e. about 60% desert, lots of swamp-land etc.) and a tiny state which was SO open to attack, 7 nations managed it within a day....

Can someone please explain to me how the heck Shebaa farms are in any way considered lebanese?! at all?! i dont get it!

We have to compare their characters - Nelson Mandela, albeit allegedly involved in minor acts of terrorism, evoked world-wide respect that was never proferred to Begin.

Point out whereabouts in my post there is an 'implicit assumption' that Israeli leaders are the sole cause for the perpetuation of the conflict.

You won't be able to since I neither said nor inferred that they were, simply because there has to be at least two sides for conflict to arise.  

Dont be defensive when there is no reason for it.

"...Nelson Mandela is greatly respected as the epitome of diplomacy and enabler/facilitator of a peaceful South Africa. No comparison possible with any former or current Israeli leaders - as far as is observable - since they are still in a constant state of conflict."

That looks a lot to me like "Considering that Israel's leaders have done nothing to abate the conflict, we cannot compare them to so saintly a figure as Mandela". Perhaps I misread it but I think you can see why one would draw that conclusion.

No we don't. That is irrelevant to the questions posed by the threadstarter - how Israel can morally justify having "terrorist" for their head of state.

If you were expecting some sort of idealistic defence of one and an attack of another then you could construe an 'implicit assumption that Israeli leaders have sole responsibility for the conflict-' - however, that was not my stance, so you are actually projecting your own impressions onto me and giving me ownership for them! Strange...  

 
No we don't. That is irrelevant to the questions posed by the threadstarter - how Israel can morally justify having "terrorist" for their head of state.
 

Yes we do! The thread starter's question was intercepted by another poster who stated that South Africa had a terrorist for their head of state. In other words, since South Africa did, there is no justification for condemnation of Israel doing the same thing - thus leading to my observation.

Threads evolve and take on wider, but related discussions over and above the OP.
 
 
Banning people who were terrorists from being heads of state is ridiclous as the Mandala example shows. To achive peace you have to invovle as many sides as possible including terrorists and ex-terrorists. For Israel to take such an aggressive stanch against terrorists is understandable but wrong. As the wars of 1948, 56, 67, 73 showed Arab governments are unable to fight a succesful war with Israel so terrorism is the only way the Israeli state can be fought just as the only way the Israeli's could get a state was by using terrorist methods against the British and Palistians. I not saying the acts of terrorism are right just that these are the only outlet for both groups to achive what they want
 
 
I'm writing my coursework for french on the lebenon/israel conflict, but there are a few areas I'm uncertain about, and was wondering if you guys could help!

1) Why were the two soldiers kidnapped
2) The history between lebenon and Israel

Any answers would be a huge help!  

Thanks

Yes. We've discussed this previously on the "Was Isreal founded on terrorism" thread.
 
 
1) In order to get back some of thier own prisoners illegaly held in israeli prisons.
2) Just like the history between israel and any other arab country...bloody.
 
 
hehe.. such unflinching, historically accurate neutrality is commendable.

HAHA, i would pos-rep you if i could for this post. I absolutely love the "A few areas i'm uncertain about.......the catalyst, and everything else".
 
 
1) There are only 3 or 4 Lebanese prisoners held in Israeli prisoners since a major prisoners swap in 2004 resulted in Israel releasing hundreds. Of those that remian, one is a convicted terrorist and murderer, one a convicted spy, one a convicted Hezbollah fighter. None of those are held illegally. And the fourth has been claimed to exist by Lebanon, but Israel denies this - the specifics on him, if he exists, are unclear. So who exactly are they trying to get back? Well, I'll tell you. Hezbollah's main interest is the release of Samir Qantar, a man who is serving several life sentences for murder after attacking a civilian apartment block in northern Israel in 1979, in which he killed a policeman, another man and a four-year-old girl.

2) Lebanon-Israel history is bloody and complicated. For years Southern Lebanon played host to the PLO - who launched attacks on Israel. That was the reason Isarel initially got involved in Lebanon - which has also been wracked by civil war for years. Israel's complete pullout from Lebanon was confirmed by the UN in 2000. Since then there have been intermittent border clashes, including cross-border Hezbollah attacks and shelling and Israeli reprisal raids. Nothing quite as intensive as the last couple of months however.

Ah, but the "cavalry" cam to "rectify" that little situation quickly enough.
 
 
That's why D&D is not the place to find out about the history of an ideologically charged conflict for a school exam.
 
 
Surely you appreciate that Israeli terrorism occurred in the context of comparable violence throughout the region?

YIf the people voted him in, they must have found something to like in him. Israel is not South Africa, and, peacemaker or not, those who elected or allowed him to take office clearly saw something in him that they felt was desirable in a leader. Being a peacemaker doesn't necessarily make one ineligible tfor political office. So a comparison with Mandela - "good" as he may be as a person - is irrelevant.

Disingenius they may be but they do have their merits. Is it not a topsy turvy world we live in where a state that (arguably) owes its existance to terrorism and who promotes one such terrorist to PM can criticise its neighbors for electing terrorists to public office as in the case of Hamas and Hezbollah? Surely sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.

Delay tactics leading the unwitting into a false sense of security. I predict a dawn attack probably starting with heavy artillery fire or aerial bombardment of enemy positions (all civilians are advised to leave the area immediately)

The context in which the two arguments are made is different. I would say Israel is justified in making such criticisms, because Hamas etc have shown their willingness to injure Israel and her citizens. To ensconce them as leaders and still hope to treat with Israel is unrealistic. The problem here is that having terrorists as political leaders makes a guarantee of good behaviour very difficult to extract and enforce when treating with the Palestinians. This was part of the problem in the Northern Ireland peace process as you well know. You are downgrading the wider issue by merely pointing fingers and presenting a charge of hypocrisy when realistically speaking, I think it's a very real political hurdle to peace and a Palestinian State. As long as Israel feels she can't guarantee her security, she will always have an excuse to leave the status quo unaltered. So pointing fingers won't get us anywhere. It merely obscures some more important problems. Begin may have been a terrorist before he became PM, but, unlike the leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah, he wasn't at the time he held political office. He therefore posed no constant or immediate threat.

1. Israel, contrary to popular myth, does not "owe it's existence to terrorism" when all the other factors are considered. From mass Jewish immigration to the Mandate, to the Balfour Declaration to the Holocaust demonstrating the need for a Jewish State, Israel's existence came about as a result of many factors, terrorism being only a small part. Indeed, partition plans were around in the 1930s, before any 'terrorism' got properly going. Simply put, Israel would have been created whether there was terrorism or not - it may have been a little later, or a little different, but it undoubtedly would have happened.

2. Israel only promoted a terrorist to public office if you agree with the "once a terrorist, always a terrorist" idea. The groups Begin was associated with disbanded when Israel was created, at the end of the 1940's. He was elected PM 3 decades later at a time when he was no longer engaged in terrorist activity and had not been for 30 years, but was in fact a mainstream political figure. His historic peace deal with Egypt surely shows that he was far beyond his past activities.

3. Hamas were elected to power whilst still actively engaged in terrorism and still dedicated to using terrorism against Israel. They had not changed, not joined regular politics, not moderated in anyway - they were a still active terror group. Same goes for Hezbollah's participation in the government of Lebanon - carried out whilst still actively a terrorist group.

So, on one side you have those like Mandela and Begin - once terrorists, but reformed, changed and decades past such actions, who on gaining power showed that they could make peace and be diplomatic. On the other you have Hamas and Hezbollah - happily committed to and carrying out terror attacks whilst being elected and upon gaining power showing they have changed not one iota and are still as intransigent and dedicated to violence as ever. That's a pretty substantial difference - enough to justify the choices of South Africans and Israelis and still allowing them to criticise the choices of the palestinians and others.

Actually, NO!

The tiny threat of attack (of any kind) in israel is far outweighed by the daily anti-semitism (and attacks) MANY french jews in france receive every day! atleast jewish cemetry's in israel and regularly daubed in swastikas!

How often is Israel actually bombed? There hasn't been a suicide bomb for months and unless you're counting the war with Hezbollah which is now apparently over, Israel has not been put in danger for ages.

And, it's not just minor anti-semitism like you think. Surely you heard about the French Jew that was killed not long ago just for being Jewish? There's been plenty of cases like this where Jews are seriously assaulted in France especially but all over the world too (except Israel).

Statistically speaking its hell of a lot more dangerous being Jewish in isreal than it is in France. Being assaulted is one thing, getting bombed is another.

Do you have thier phone numbers or e-mail adds so i can make contact and explain to them??

If you actually bother to read the thread, i said i dont get why they move away from danger to even more danger. I didnt express a desire to explain why they shouldnt move

Anddddddd can you tell me when the last suicide bomb was? Statistically, yes. But you must remember statistics have flaws in. If you look at them in more detail, one can observe that the amount of people killed in terror attacks in Israel has decreased and decreased and decreased due to...oh yes, the security barrier! Therefore, in the past, there was more danger. Now? No. Hence, a large amount of French Jews moving to Israel. It must be prettttty bad in France for them to move to Israel which is oh so very dangerous, as you say.

I don't think its that outrageous, but it is factually wrong.
Israel was all but sponsored by AMERICANS, but not the AMERICAN GOVERNMENT.

However, by recongizing Israel in those early days, it made it easier for those jewish americans and zionists (many of whom later moved to israel) to send funding and supplies in an israel wise direction.

America was quite narked with ISrael in the early days. Especially over the whole Suez canal debarcle. Silly really, its not like they didn't do a hundred things a hundred times worse a hundred times more often. Bananas costing 10 cents more? nonsense, lets just stage a 'bloodless coup'

And, it's not just minor anti-semitism like you think. Surely you heard about the French Jew that was killed not long ago just for being Jewish? There's been plenty of cases like this where Jews are seriously assaulted in France especially but all over the world too (except Israel).

 

Especially in France?
Sorry but this is complete bs. France is far more open in its racism than the UK. But this is a reflection of the people. In the UK people will tell you thast you suck behind your back and thus racism is latent.

It is an oft neglected fact that the EU's biggest jewish population is in France. Not bad for the anti-semitic capital of the Western world  .

Anti-semitism exists in France, as it does in the UK and Holland and Spain, but it is not ingrained in gallic thought. The little bugger who put nazi graffiti in jewish cemetries in Paris had his grandmother die in the Second World War (Edit: In the holocaust). Whilst in the UK, many shops in Golders Green have recently been the subject of many attacks with many shopowners receiving death threats.
The fact you probably didn't know this is alarming, when news stories showing a supposed anti-semitic society stream in from France all the time.

Anyway, Ive just returned from the pub so this might not make much sense, but is has stemmed from my learned fingers so there is probably much to be learnt from this gahgah.

A terrorist leader of the terrorist Zionists that carried out the King david hotel bombing became 2 time PM of Israel. This shows the Israelis prejudice towards its terrorist history and support for its terrorist leaders just for the sake of a piece of land that even their book prohibits them from. Up till now they call Nasrallah a terrorist, very amusing.

Talk about double standard.
 
 
I'm sure if you really tried you could have squeezed the word "terrorist" in to that comment just a bit more...
 
 
What a stupid thread.

You're trying to draw parallels between past and present? The siege of khartoum would be considered totally barbaric by todays standards. The very thought of a rocket which could kill 1000 people or a biological weapon would have been considered barbaric back then.

You're also screwing up your facts, but theres no point debunking you point by point. The fact you're using an irrelevant item of the past to justify an argument now is indicative of your ignorance.

If this is so, when Nasrallah stated..

It is an open war until the elimination of Israel and until the death of the last Jew on earth.

It was dated - 1992! and it is still mentioned and widespread today!

If you dont want mentions of the irrelevant items of the past, stop mentioning that Nasrallah stated Zionists should be eliminated, as it according to you is an irrelevant item of the past.

This is very weak proof, but surprisingly this little comment was more popular in the Lebanon-Israel showdown than it ever was.
 
 
Well the Lebanese left-wing newspaper The Daily Star reported the word "Jew", not zionist.

اليهودي

Was the exact word used in print.

I wouldn't call somebody a terrorist for saying something.

If Nasrallah is not acting on his words, or enticing others too; then yes of course it's in the past.

Edit: Sorry, that was directed at me. I havn't stated that and don't intend to. I know he hates Israel and he's entitled to his opinion.

I think its fair to say he wouldnt be bothered if every jew on earth suddenly dropped dead.
He's a bit of a lunatic to be fair, and probably has justifiable reasons personally for acting that way. (maybe he lost a daughter or wife? I don't know) Perhaps hes just a little insane and can't forgive. But that doesn't make him a terrorist if he stops acting on what he says. He should concentrate on building hospitals etc instead.

I don't think most muslims would truthfully agree with his philosophies though. Thank god.

According to the Arabic - English online translation, it means 'hair plait' or 'hair braid'.  

btw - the Daily Star is owned by that famous 'soft-porn' king, Richard Desmond who also owns the Daily Express...and I believe he is Jewish (although is someone disagrees I can always find out for sure whether he is or not)

Edit: Ah, yes - here we have it: "Desmond, who is Jewish, says he won't be satisfied until "the Rothermeres have gone".

What has the fact that Britain's Daily Star is owned by a Jew got to do with a Lebanese newspaper which happens to share the same name using the word 'Jew' in a translation of Nasrallah's comments? That's a pretty tenuous and fatuous link.

Not a lot, maybe - except coincidence.

I looked at numerous translation websites and they all said 'hair braid' or 'hair plaits'.

It could be that the curly side locks that orthodox Jews wear have resulted in the arabic word for hair plaits to be colloquially applied to Jews. That is the only explanation I can think of for your's and FIMN's claim.

I'll check English to Arabic translation and see what comes up.

Yet I did already know all this - last week there was an anti-Semitic attack in a cafe in Golders Green. But I'll let you off with your hasty assumption because you have been under the influence of alcohol. Anyway back to the point, yes I am aware that it's not just France that has anti-Semitism as I've already pointed out but I said "especially France" because that was the topic at hand - I wasn't trying to insinuate it happens more there, although I would like an explanation why there has been a rapid increase in the number of French Jews moving to Israel lately unlike in other countries where it has remained pretty steady.
 
 
Here we go:

اليهودي = Jew (English to Arabic translation)

اليهودي = hair-braid (Arabic to English translation)

Must be as I suggested - it's the culy side-locks that do it.
 
 
But what's this got to do with your comedy attempt to imply bias by a newspaper simply because it happens to have the same name as a newspaper in another country which is owned by a Jew?

You've got you knickers in a twist again over something that you have deliberately decided to misinterpret. That's a warning offence on D&D!

FIMN mentioned the Daily Star - I assumed he was referring to the English newspaper since although he mentioned Lebanese left-wing I thought he meant a view that was pro-Lebanese rather than pro-Zionist (and to be perfectly honest I was unaware that there was such a newspaper in Lebanon.)

When I found that Britain's Daily Star was owned by Richard Desmond, who is Jewish I wondered how he could be considered supportive of Lebanon rather than Israel.

So you see, once again you have undermined another member because of your tendency to see bias when there is none intended. I am already suffered the slander of being called a liar by you - even though you found out I was not lying and never retracted your slur on my character.

This is the last time I shall ask you - Do not enter into any communication with me or about me - if it were possible to add a mod to my ignore list you would be on it - since I cannot, do not engage me in conversation, please.

I don't fully understand - is danielf90 trying to say it's more safer to live in israel than in France?  
 
 
"especially France" seems to imply, to my mind at least, that France is more culpable of anti-semitism than other nations.

As for emigration from France: the reason is simple...jews just don't appreciate good cheese and wine.

Okay, as funny as your last statement might be, you still have not come up with a plausible reason why and therefore the "especially France" is quite justified.
 
 
Because Mr Sharon called for all jews living in France to return to Israel? And has denounced France more than any other Western nation...?!

And why did he do that? Why did he just tell the French Jews that?

Plus, do you actually think him telling them to move would make them? I think it'd take a lot more than that. If Bush told all Jews to move to America, I really don't think many would listen.

Because he's an idiot. The most hilarious thing your sister told me is that "All French people are anti-semitic" (even if she took it back). And now you're repeating similar sentiments. I dont have a clue what it is based on that doesn't exist in other countries.

Bush is not the head of a state established to give the jews a homeland. Sharon was. Sharon did not command a position like that of the pope to Catholics but it was still very influential. Your analogy is a false one.
Things aren't pretty in France but they aren't pretty anywhere in Western Europe. I dont like crass generalisations, but jewish people I have met (a fair few now) are strong people who I have a lot of time for (at least 13 nanoseconds). Whether this is in spite of much derision and hatred or because of it, I don't know. But I do know things are getting better. Thank God (or the spaghetti monster - I'll accept thanks on his behalf!).
Anyway. Before I started a tired sidespeech I was trying to reconcile the idea that France is not more anti-semitic than other Western countries and yet it has a higher rate of emigration among the jewish population than other Western countries (something which I take your word for).
Man Im too tired for this. 12 hour working day having been to the pub last night. Oh my.
Aside from a respected jewish figure encouraging it, France's sympathetic policy towards Arab nations (more so than most other Western nations) would leave a lot of jews feeling in the cold.
But still France has the largest jewish population and do you like brie?
 
 
In Arabic, that word has both a noun form and adjective form. It's translating it wrongly.

Hezbollah's main interest is the release of Samir Qantar, a man who is serving several life sentences for murder after attacking a civilian apartment block in northern Israel in 1979, in which he killed a policeman, another man and a four-year-old girl.

2) Lebanon-Israel history is bloody and complicated. For years Southern Lebanon played host to the PLO - who launched attacks on Israel. That was the reason Isarel initially got involved in Lebanon - which has also been wracked by civil war for years. Israel's complete pullout from Lebanon was confirmed by the UN in 2000. Since then there have been intermittent border clashes, including cross-border Hezbollah attacks and shelling and Israeli reprisal raids. Nothing quite as intensive as the last couple of months however.

I just came back from a holiday having stayed in Israel for a couple of nights and i was so impressed with all the security and how cautious the people were. Such a beautiful country as well..and i felt quite safe, which was totally unexpected... you get the feeling that every single citizen in Israel is working hard for a safer place..

The word you provided is the noun form and that is the variance between the two, ie hair-braid and Jew.

The IDF continues its terrorist campaign while the world watches. Shame on you.

Had hezbullah kidnapped 6 israeli civilians, all hell wouldve been broken lose from tel aviv to london to washington but since its lebanese civilians, its all okay. Theres nothing wrong with kidnapping arabs because we are worth 'less' than the jews. Sham on the world !!!!

Or should i remind you that lebanon was virtually destroyed because 2 israeli soldiers were kidnapped? While israel kidnapped 6 CIVILIANS and i couldnt even find an article about it on CNN. I dont blame those news sources because after all, the zionists control them and thye cant do anything about it.

Down with IDF terrorism.
 
 
Typical zionist response:
 
We have secret intelligence that these people are potential terrorists, intelligence is not intelligence if everyone knows, so we'll use this excuse to get away with having to explain everything!

Had Hezbollah captured 6 Israeli civilians, you could guarantee they wouldn't be alive right now. That's why all the fuss isnb't present.

"Lebanon" was virtually destroyed because of 10 months of Hezbollah rocket attacks, which the Lebanese government failed to address, refusing to enforce it's monopoly on the use of force, therefore failing one of the criteria for being a sovereign state. Lebanon cannot complain about territories that it has no control over, and if it does have control over it, it constitutes an act of war.
 
 
I think it's based on the fact that you can walk proudly down the street as a Jew in Israel and will not be the subject of anti-semitism or an assault for your religion. Try the same in other countries, especially in certain parts of them, you feel more self-conscious and often threatened. Would you go parading around certain areas of the Paris banlieues late at night proudly declaring yourself a Jew?
 
 
If you did, you'd just be a ****** Same for anywhere.

"On May 28, 2006, rockets were fired from Lebanon into Israel. Hours later, Israel responded by bombing suspected militant sites and exchanging fire across the border. The UN negotiated a ceasefire the same day."

"Katyushas have also been used outside Russia and the former Soviet republics, in particular by the Hezbollah Lebanese militia in the bombardment of Israeli towns, before and especially during the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict. The Hezbollah rocket arsenal included BM-21-derived launchers and, notably, longer-ranged Fajr-3 rockets."

My point is that until the Lebanese Govt. has control of Lebanon (ALL OF IT!) then Lebanon cannot complain about attacks.

You've explained since that you were mistaken and thought that the paper being referred to was the British version. However my post came before that explanation, and all we had was your apparent non sequitur linking the two papers and the fact that one had a Jewish owner. Given the circumstances it wasn't an unjustifiable assumption.

No, it requires a monopoly on the use of force. Any geogrpahic area in which Lebanon does not have a monopoly is not a sovereign state. If it'd been one missile, after which the Lebanese government chased after the pepetrators, it'd be a different matter.

Also, the destruction of civlian infrastructure shows more about the true israeli intentions.

You are just tryign to be ignorant. Rocket attacks have stopped. What are you talking about?
 
 
 http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/760517.html 

Heres an israeli source. It says 6 people including a policeman.

Four of the villagers, were taken in Aita al-Shaab, a village that saw heavy fighting between Hezbollah militants and the IDF during their 34-day war, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media.

A fifth man, from the Lebanese police security service, was also seized at Aita al-Shaab when he arrived at the scene, villagers said.

The state-run National News Agency said IDF troops also seized another villager at Marwaheen in the same region and drove him across the border into Israel in a convoy of two vehicles.

Villagers in Aita al-Shaab said four of the young men seized were working at the local school when an IDF raiding party crossed over the border about one kilometer away and detained them Friday afternoon.

"There has been no shooting here and there is no Hezbollah. I have no idea why the Israelis captured my son," said Abu Hassan Dakdouk, the father of the captured police officer, Hassan Dakdouk.

The villagers said that the IDF troops carried out a search in the small border village four days ago, but they did not know what they were looking for.

The IDF is in the process of withdrawing from areas they seized in the south during their Lebanon offensive, and Lebanese soldiers and United Nations peacekeepers are taking their place under the terms of a UN-brokered cease-fire that began August 14.

Since the truce began, Israeli troops have seized Lebanese in areas they control on three other occasions, the officials said. In each case, the detained Lebanese were handed over to UN peacekeepers at the Lebanese border village of Naqoura, apparently after being taken into Israel for questioning.
 
 
Also, it says there were 3 occasions of kidnappings and guess what.. 4 of them were working in a bloody school and a fifth is a policeman who arrived at the scenec. Clearly, israel is trying to opress the lebanese in southern lebanon to provoke a response from hezbullah and then start crying to bush and blair.

Moreover, it also talks about a number of civlians still dying from the israeli terrorist bombing campaign (unexploded cluster bombs). Clearly, israel had vioalted international law by using cluster bombs in civilian areas. But that is another issue.

The military benefit of killing civilians is clearly too much for them to ignore.
 
 
Erm, am I the only one who sees that the Haaretz article opens with the line:
"The Israel Defense Forces released five prisoners in southern Lebanon on Saturday after being questioned, an army spokeswoman said."

Nicely left out by viva italia 2, wasn't it? The fact that THESE PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY BEEN RELEASED. They were picked up on Friday, questioned, and released less than a day later! And yet he claims this is "srael trying to opress the lebanese in southern lebanon to provoke a response from hezbullah" - what by detaining some suspicious people, questioning them and releasing them soon after? That's deliberate provocation of Hezbollah? What the hell are you on.

Christ, talk about a storm in a f**king teacup.
 
 
5 of them have been release. Read the article please.

Plus, the kidnapping of anyone inside another country's land is an act of war. Whether you return them or not !!!
 
 
1. They were detained during Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon. What was Israel supposed to do - jut allow people behaving suspiciously to carry on doing so near their forces? Or is it actually entirely reasonable for them to detain the men, find out what's going on, and then release them again shortly after, which is what they did.
2. It's not a "kidnapping" - these people were detained by authorities, questioned and released in a matter of hours. That doesn't meet ANY reasonable definition of "kidnapping" under any law.
3. 5 have been released. The only evidence that a sixth person even exists are unconfirmed Lebanese claims. And given their piss-poor record on accurate information, that's not really good enough.

This whole stupid topic is an incredibly poor and utterly transparent attempt to portray a pathetically minor event as some sort of major crisis.
 
 
1. Act suspiciously? what are you talking about? they were in a freakin school and the fifth was a policeman coming to check whats going on. The article says that the israeli force CROSSED THE BORDER to detain the people which means a premeditated act to kidnap people.

2. It is kidnapping. The land is not part of israel and the army has no right to detain unarmed people within a lebanese town.

3. No, the haaretz article says there were 6. And the past war has shown who has a 'piss-poor' record on accurate information: the almighty IDF.

Surely, the intention of kidnapping those unarmed civilians was to terrorize the town and terrorize southern lebanon. It has happened 3 times after the 1701 resolution which means 3 breaches. Added to all the breaches of lebanese air space, we can see how yet another resolution is ignored by the terrorist state.

This IS state sponsored terrorism, whether you like it or not.

No, the article says: "The five prisoners were detained by soldiers patrolling Aita al-Shaab, a village which came under Israel's control during the war against Hizbollah."

They were detained by forces patrolling a Lebanese village - not by forces who crossed the border. In fact, the whole "school" and "Israeli cross-border" idea is only supported by some completely unnamed and unidentified "Lebanese villagers" - there is nothing to suggest that it is true in any way.

Actually, it does have a right to carry out defensive operations under Resolution 1701. Anyway, it's not kidnapping - "kidnapping" inherently means that either some sort of price, act or ransom is demanded for their release or there is some sort of desire to use them for some purpose - nothing of that sort was demanded or carried out by Israel - the men were released once it was verified they were not a threat. These men were not kidnapped, simple as that - any attempt to say they were is a lie.

That's what Israel does to terrorise? Detain some men, question them and release them unharmed mere hours later? FFS, is anything Israel does not interpreted as evil terrorising in your eyes? Seriously, get a grip on reality - all you're doing is displaying to everyone your complete lack of reason or rationality on issues which involve Israel.

The resolution gives Israel the right to carry on defensive operations. Detaining people for questioning and then releasing them is clearly not any sort of aggressive military action, it is a precautionary measure.

This is you making a mountain out of a grain of sand. I would say 'molehill' but it really doesn't warrant such a high categorisation. This is not even close to any sort of terrorism - they non-violently detained several people, questioned them and released them completely unharmed within hours. How does that possibly fit any definition of terrorism? Oh wait, I forgot, the definition of terrorism you apply is "any action of the State of Israel that I don't approve of".

If Hezbollah kidnapped Israeli civilians in the Israeli border, we would almost certainly see another Israeli terror campaign for another 30 days, before another cease fire (when the IDF feel they have done enough damage and destruction)...

In neither city will a reasonable jew fear attack walking down a high street. In neither city is the risk of attack great. In neither city do the majority of jews and muslims have a problem with each other.
 
 
I can say you paid no attention to the thread because if you had then you would know that what happened could in no way constitute "kidnapping" and that the whole issue was resolved in a matter of hours.
 
 
Ok so if hezbullah CROSSED the israeli border and kidnapped israeli civilians and realesed them the next day.. you wudnt mind?
 
 
Are you trying to annoy me? How is

If Hezbollah kidnapped Israeli civilians in the Israeli border, we would almost certainly see another Israeli terror campaign for another 30 days, before another cease fire (when the IDF feel they have done enough damage and destruction)...

...not relevant in this debate? just read it more carefully, it is very relevant to this thread thus my opinion is not utterly irrelevant.
 
 
While the Israelis may well have captured some more Lebanese civilians, it's true to say that Hezbollah haven't exactly be brilliant on the kidnapping front themselves, have they? Casting our minds back just a few months, we might notice that it was the Hezbollah terrorist organisation that began with the most recent conflict when they captured an Israeli soldier.
 
 
They captured an israeli soldiers true. However, the IDF has kidnapped a huge number of lebanese/palestenian civilians and in the palestenian case: politicans and kept them in their dungeons. The hezbullah operation is nothing more than an attempt to return some of the innocent civlians kidnapped by israel.

HOWEVER THIS IS IRRELEVANT TO THIS TOPIC BECAUSE:

My point is that when an israeli soldier is kidnapped, a whole country is virtually destroyed by planes with cluster bombs and smart bombs while its ok to kidnap lebanese civilians on a regular basis (3 times since the resolution) and the fact that they were later released and then more kidnapped only comes to prove that the whole point of the kidnappings is to terrorize the public in southern lebanon.

Nothign new for the israeli terror machine.
 
 
Unfortunately you know that not to be quite true, as do I. Before this most recent conflict began, Hezbollah, a notable terrorist organisation engaged in a widescale mass rocketing campaign of Israeli territories. In this latest case, Hezbollah were the aggressors.

The 'Israeli Terror Machine' as you so put it, is in fact a soverign nation rather than a Terrorist organisation. Hezbollah, as is HAMAS, are built around violence and blood-shed. One look at Hezbollah's symbolic flag tells much. A picture tells a thousand words.

Further, it's probably not worth arguing with you since you seem too entrenched in your position to bother with. Notable also is your high warning level. A tell-tale sign I feel...
 
 
I read as far 'http://www.aljazeera' and then stopped. That not very biased news station!!
 
 
Is isreal losing the plot??

 
Between then and the end of August, Israeli security forces killed 226 Palestinians, 54 of them minors, in the Gaza Strip, the Israeli Human rights group, B'Tselem has reported.

The group says 114 of these were not taking part in any hostilities when killed, and 46 of them were minors.

In August alone 76 Palestinians were killed by the Israeli military, 19 of them minors, in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. More than half of those killed were not participating in hostilities at the time, B'Tselem says.

Hezbullah is a terrorist organization only in your eyes and in the eyes of other zionist sympathizers, however, in most people's eyes they are not terrorists. For example, the only coutnries that designated it as a terrorist organization are britain and US. Enuff said.

And can you please show me ONE.. just ONE source which says that hezbullah engaged in widescalle mass rocketing campaign of israel territories? There were isolated instances of cross border fire but they were all aimed at military installations of the occupation forces ie the IDF.

Furthermore, prior to this conflict israel killed lebanese farmers, kidnapped civlians, etc etc etc. It also still holds part of lebanese territory.

Clearly here israel is the agressor, unless zionist propaganda has taken over your mind.

My first post just stated that Al-Jazeera are biased (and in my opinion scummy) organisation.

The only country i'm bothered about is Britain. Please explain why i am pro-israeli you mug.
 
 
Hezbollah are a terrorist organisation in most sensible people's minds. They are a terrorist organisation, just like HAMAS or the IRA since they are using uneccessary violence when diplomatic options are avaliable - it's just that they haven't been judged so by the EU yet, but they will be soon enough once the French stop messing around.

Funny, I thought it was common knowledge that Hezbollah had engaged in a mass rocket campaign. If their rockets were only 'isolated instances' then that would surely mean that Israeli capturing of so called innocent Lebanese civilians was isolated too?

And Hezbollah killed many innocent bystanders too. Yeah, I know. Same for same isn't it. Until one side stops, the fighting will go on endlessly. But of course it won't stop, because religion is involved and both sides are at complete odds - one believing in a free state of Israel and the other side completely opposed to it.
 
 
common knowledge?

Ok back up the common knowledge with some evidence.. otherwise ur gonna look like a complete idiot.

And explain to me how they are a terrorist organization when they are a resistence group resisting illegal israeli occupation of their land? Only time they will be called a terrorist organization is when israel withdraws from their land and they still have weapons.

If you asked the entire British public now whether or not they think Hezbullah are terrorists, then i think you would find 98% would say- yes.
 
 
WHo are you to speak of the british public huh?

Infact, blair has lost lots of popularity because of his support of israel. I think that if 98% thought they were terrorists, blair would gain popularity not lose it.
 
 
Yes, common knowlege. I had read about it in a number of newspapers including the Times.

How polite of you to start throwing around insults. Explains perhaps why your warning level is so high.

Hezbollah are not a resistence group. They have diplomatic means open to them yet instead they chose violence.

As I said before, you are too blinded by dogmatic beliefs to see both sides. All you see is your side. So, on that note, goodnight.

This makes me chuckle. Are you forgetting that hezbollah kidnapped 2 Israeli soldiers to negotiate with the IDF In prisoner exchanges?

Especially quoting unnecessary violence - was it not the IDF who were indiscriminately targeting Lebanon? shelling all the roads, shelling Hezbollah houses? shelling all the infrastructure (including - causing unnecessary Oil spillages) and applying Air and Sea blockades?

You cannot possibly still be pushing this line, can you?

Everybody on this board with a mind, and even most without, knows what you are saying is completely false. Hezbollah fired 3,700+ rockets at Israel, the VAST MAJORITY aimed at exclusively civiliand towns and cities, such as Haifa and Kiryat Shemona. You are lying, as usual, through your teeth.
 
 
Here's a picture of palestinian gunmen firing on Israeli troops:

 http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/ap/2...ans_jrl132.jpg 
 http://littlegreenfootballs.com/webl...nShields02.jpg 

And people act surprised when civilians die in the crossfire? It's absolutely inevitable when the palestinians show such a monumental lack of care and place children directly in the firing line.

Lost popularity from some muslims yes- from most of the ordinary British public, no. If there was a general election tomorrow he'd still get voted back in.

Your theory that the only people who think hezbullah are terrorists are pro israeli makes you look quite the idiot. tbh.

No. I was talking to Gems originally and she would have known. Cos somewhere inside her head neurons are firing and stuff. Admittedly it happens as rarely as Israel does wrong in JonH's eyes, but it does happen. Bless her.

Im not going to justify racism. They are fools.
But MOST jews will never have encountered verbal abuse walking down the street.

Given the animosity between Palestine and Israel and between jews and muslims (particularly towards the jews) it is little surprise that a jew leaves himself MORE open to abuse walking through a muslim area than through a jewish area.
I am not justifying this. It is wrong. But if I walked through some parts of Brixton (an area of London known for a high percentage of black people and street crime) at night then I would be leaving myself MORE open, as a white male, to abuse. This isn't right, but it is true.

 
YET, soo many jews are moving out of paris, hardly any are mvoing from london! why is that?
 

There's only so far I can take this without having heard the story. If you show me an article with some figures in I'll take this further. If not I'll honorably plead ignorance.
As I have previously suggested, it could well be to do with the fact that Sharon called for all jews living in France to escape this anti-semitic cauldron (   ) and move to Israel.
He was a fool for saying this.
 
 
Im still waiting for someone to get me a source which says that hezbullah engaged in mass rocketing of northern israel prior to the war, as someone has claimed on the board.

And concerning the british public - yes, blair lost popularity from all sides, it takes only a small ammount of brains to figure that out unless u wanna be just completely ignorant.
 
 
and heres an article, again from an israeli source, saying how blair, amongst other pro-zionists, lost lots of popularity:

Any source on the early days of the war will tell you that the Hezbollah kidnapping was carried out under cover of a Hezbollah barrage.
 
 
first of all, can you show me the source

secondly, how does that constitute hezbullah engaging in 'mass rocketing of civilian areas' ?
 
 
^Thirdly Israel was mass rocketing at civilian areas in Lebanon.
 
 
I think everyone needs to stop saying "what most sensible people think" because (and here I am, being a hypocrit) I think most 'sensibile people' couldn't give two ****s.

There are no diplomatic options available for Hezbollah that address the causes of the conflict and until there are, it is unlikely the conflict will cease.

The IRA had to wage a military campaign to bring our government to the negotiating table and once that was achieved the military campaign ceased.

It is better that the option for diplomacy commences immediately to save further bloodshed.

Nope, because my interpretation of it was a completely justifiable one based on the evidence at the time. When all we had to go on was your post which contained what could only be described as an entirely irrational non sequitur (Daily Star used word Jew, other newspaper of same name owned by Jew which was what you technically implied by your language), how is that an unjustifable interpretation?

Now your current argument on the other hand...

I think it would be somewhat naive to think that when it comes to subjects that are inherently important to the owner of a newspaper, bias comes to the forefront 'big time', regardless of the name of the publication.

Murdoch has a reputation for imposing his own dictatorial opinions on the editors on his newspapers.

Here's a link to the university of Lancaster with just a few examples of his shenanigans:  http://www.lancs.ac.uk/staff/trowler...ut.htm#murdoch 

The man is a media despot!  
 
 
lool u just have to hear the skynews interview with george galloway to see how biased murdoch and his clan are..

the girl interviewing galloway was actually arguing with him not asking him questions, which completely defeats the purpose of an interview and turns it into a 'debate' with skynews

The Irgun, dressed as Arabs, exploded a bomb at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, which had been the base for the British Secretariat, the military command and a branch of the Criminal Investigation Division (police). 91 people were killed, most of them staff of the secretariat and the hotel[1]: 28 British, 41 Arab, 17 Jewish, and 5 other. Around 45 people were injured.

The attack was initially ordered by Menachem Begin, the head of the Irgun, who would later become Israeli Prime Minister. The attack was commanded by Yosef Avni and Yisrael Levi."

------------------------------------------------------------

The terrorist attack killed 91 civilians, more than any attack by an arab organization against jews. The leader of that group which carried out the attack became prime minister of israel TWICE not once...

In the meantime, nesrallah, the leader of hezbullah, whos main targets are israeli soldiers, is classified as a terrorist.

Talk about double standards..

 

 

And I was told that zionists have zero influence in the Israeli government.  

And the Irgun dressing as Arabs drives me mad too.

George Galloway was not lying when he said that Israel is a terrorist state.

Galloway started the mud-slinging, not the interviewer if I remember rightly. And we still haven't seen any evidence that says Murdoch is "openly Zionist" in his views.

Bush is not the head of a state established to give the jews a homeland. Sharon was. Sharon did not command a position like that of the pope to Catholics but it was still very influential. Your analogy is a false one.
Things aren't pretty in France but they aren't pretty anywhere in Western Europe. I dont like crass generalisations, but jewish people I have met (a fair few now) are strong people who I have a lot of time for (at least 13 nanoseconds). Whether this is in spite of much derision and hatred or because of it, I don't know. But I do know things are getting better. Thank God (or the spaghetti monster - I'll accept thanks on his behalf!).
Anyway. Before I started a tired sidespeech I was trying to reconcile the idea that France is not more anti-semitic than other Western countries and yet it has a higher rate of emigration among the jewish population than other Western countries (something which I take your word for).
Man Im too tired for this. 12 hour working day having been to the pub last night. Oh my.
Aside from a respected jewish figure encouraging it, France's sympathetic policy towards Arab nations (more so than most other Western nations) would leave a lot of jews feeling in the cold.
But still France has the largest jewish population and do you like brie?

 

I have not even insinuated that the French are anti-Semitic. (The French teacher at my school is so nice. )   What I was getting at is that anti-Semitism seems to be higher there (obviously, I wouldn't know but you still haven't come up with a reason why more people move to Israel from France than anywhere else...why didn't Sharon tell the Jews in England to do the same?), though I am aware that it is bad everywhere.

Nope.   Not that I've ever tried it but it doesn't sound so nice. I like crepes though!!!!!!

Yeah, it really is superb there. One would assume that there's bombs going off everywhere but it's just like any other country - and it feels so peaceful when you're there, you would never think in a million years that it has just been at war.

Well so have Israel, but even worse. Israel has been stockpiling even nuclear weapons from the U.S, which don't only threat every city in lebanon, but all of the middle east. Surely they're not storing nuclear weapons for no reason.

Israel has started an invasion at south lebanon before, what would make us think that it won't do the same with other countries?

and by the way, why are you escaping from the fact that there is major zionist influence in the israeli government? EDIT: which previously you claimed it to be zero.

Right, so absolutely everything that is in the Times is influenced by 'Murdoch bias'. There is no completely unbiased media. Every news media organisation has some sort of slant on any given topic. Anyone who can write can have an opinion.

However, looking at a number of your postings, your views and thoughts don't seem particularly worthy of debate or perhaps even acknowledgement.

No, actually you said, 'The Times is owned by Rupert Murdoch, so it's hardly presenting a balanced view,' which suggested that you meant the whole document. Since you seemed to have slightly clarified your position.

All media organisations are biased, the BBC, ITV, Sky, the Telegraph, the Guardian - so I don't quite see your point.

Also, if by established member of the community you mean frequent spammer (as 'Howard' seems to be, though perhaps worse so) then yes, I would agree. However, I don't believe it is a personal insult to disregard your (certain) arguments (or lack of them persay) but an attack on the ideas themselves. Apologies if it came off as anything other than that.

That is totally irrelevant and you're shifting the point I'm getting at. Hezbollah are a group who want to eliminate Israel, yeah? So any weapons they illegally obtain in their possession, despite a unanimous vote by the UNSC to dismantle Hezbollah and prevent them getting any weapons, are seen as a threat - Israel has not threatened Lebanon or the Middle East with their "nuclear weapons." Moreover, Hezbollah instigated the war by kidnapping and killing 2 and 4 soldiers, respectively. That was seen as an act of war against Israel and immediate violation of peaceful relations. Next you're going to start telling me "well Israel have thousands of prisoners," so before you do I'll answer, Israel have four prisoners, and rightfully held in their prisons.

Are you trying to justify that Hezbollah have a right to illegally obtain weapons to launch against Israel? They have been doing this for 6 years ever since Israel's withdrawal. Why? Israel withdrew and this is what they get in return? Hardly seems fair to me.

When have I once denied there's a "major Zionist influence" in the government? I don't doubt there is an influence but I fail to see how this is even the slightest bit relevant to the debate. Are you trying to insinuate that Israel want to gain control over Southern Lebanon which is why they are invading it? That would be illogical, since they wouldn't have given up the land in the first place. And I'm sure you're aware that the majority Zionist belief is happy for the Jewish homeland as it is now, and not a wider or "greater Israel" which, might I add, is rejected by most Zionists.

You managed to completely dodge my point. I'll write it again

If lebanon is so bothered about a barren rock which was NEVER in their sovereignty, why is LEBANON doing something about it? Why is it hizbollah's job to get it back?

If Nasrallah cared for lebanon at all, he would disband his militia and push them into the lebanese army. AND if lebanon want to do something about shebaa farms then they should do it themselves! Hizbollah have wrecked their country, it's time for the lebanon try try something else!

It is as prevalent among muslim communities as it is here and France has 5 times more muslims.
But it is not the case that a jew can't walk down a main road free from the threat of any type of abuse. A Parisian jew is just as safe as a jew in London.
Also, Sharon was misguided. He was talking as much guff as Chirac when he said all Finnish food was rubbish and Blair when he said, "Cherie! You are beeyootiful".

Also, you really should try brie. It's my favourite cheese. Although crepes are very mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. Ever tried frogs legs or snails?

Why try something else? Hezbullah brought about two victories. Once in 2000 when the south was liberated from the terrorist IDF and now. I dont see how hezbullah are losing.
 
 
 
Originally Posted by viva italia2

Oh, please. Can't you make the effort to at least flirt with the truth? The IDF are not "terrorist" by any reasonable definition of the word, and there was no "liberation". Israel simply withdrew its forces, as opposed to being crushingly defeated in some massive battle and hastily pulling out what little remained of its tattered regiments. Opposing Israel is one thing, but you're verging on trolling when you choose to put it in such terms.
 
 
Yes the ID ARE terrorists by any reasonable definition of the word:

-They have engaged in mass bombings of civilian infrastructure
-They have engaged in deliberate killing of lebanese civilians (according to the latest UN report)
-Their chief threated to bring lebanon back '20 years' which is clearly an attempt to terrorize lebanon

Surely, if those terms dont make the IDF a terrorist organization then there is no other organization in the world which can be branded as a terrorist.

Also, Israel WAS kicked out of southern lebanon because of hezbullah's continuous attacks on its military installations in the south. If hezbullah hadnt put up a brave resistence against the terrorists then the south would have never been liberated.
 
 
Firstly, my working definition of terrorist is one that I stubbornly refuse to change post-11/9, regardless of what everyone else uses the term to mean. To me, a terrorist is someone who uses the creation of fear and terror as a primary tactic and a means towards their end. Therefore, I don't class either Hizbullah or the IDF as terrorists, because while both have caused an awful lot of fear one way and another, neither is doing so as a main aim. It's merely a byproduct of war, and if that makes a group "terrorists" then one might as well go the whole hog and put every army in the world on the list of state-sponsored terrorist organisations.

Secondly, Israel's withdrawal was in response to international pressure, not simply to attacks occurring in Southern Lebanon.

And thirdly, it wasn't Hizbullah, at least not for the most part; it was the PLO. What they were doing in the Lebanon I don't know, but that's where they were.

Have a read of this:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litani_Operation

So has virtually every State to have ever gone to war. It's absolutely inevitable due to the fact that in modern warfare armies inevitably use the same infrastructure as civilians. Thus if you want to go for enemy communications, power, supply routes or any other of the usual things attacked in warfare - you will inevitably have to strike infrastructure also used by civilians. It's not terrorism - it's war.

 
Originally Posted by viva italia2

Rubbish. There was no deliberate killing of Lebanese civilians. There's absolutely no motive for Israel to do that, and what about the fact that the number killed was nothing like what they could potentially have killed.

 
Originally Posted by viva italia2

Since when has war rhetoric been "terrorism"? Damn, if we were to call people terrorists for saying things, half of TSR would be imprisoned on terrorism charges - and you'd be the first.
 
 
1. Not every country has engaged in the destruction of civilian infrastructure to the scale that israel has engaged in. Infact, hardly anyone except in major world wars.

2. Yes there was deliberate killing of civilians and israel does have a motive: terrorizing the lebanese public. The latest UN report accused israel of the deliberate targeting of civilians.

3. Please, quit using silly comparisons. The IDF chief, the leader of a war machine, threatening to bring back a country 20 years in history is nothing like anyone on TSR saying anything. The guy has power to destroy lebanon and he did.

On the contrary what you`re saying is a load of bull, you get me? Israel has threatened Lebanon and actually the entire Middle East with their nuclear weapons. Just to note - Hezbollah did not start this war. When will you get this???   The IDF decided to bombard Lebanon every day/night before they felt they had done enough damage to an already volatile state. This itself is an act of war and the fact you cut down this crisis with Hezbollah kidnapping 2 Israeli Soldiers only goes to show your ignorance of this topic.

Learn some history. Even recet history - what do you think "shock and awe" did in Afghanistan and Iraq? What do you think happened in the Gulf War? What do you think happened with NATO bombing in the Balkans?
And that's just the last few years.
And before that - Vietnam, Korea. Damn, the Lebanese civil war did FAR more damage than Israel has. Yoiu're, once again, talking out your ass.

No-one is buying it. Because that's not a motive in itself - why would Israel want to terrorise the Lebanese public? What would that achieve? Come on, give me a proper motive here, one that doesn't base itself on the contention that Israel is evil and everything it does is because it's evil.

Rubbish. Lebanon is not destroyed - once again a gross over-exaggeration. Indeed, if you read the news articles - you'd know that aside from the South where Hezbollah is centered - and the Southern suburbs of Beirut, much of Lebanon is not seriously damaged. Even in Beirut, the only areas which are destroyed are the Hezbollah controlled areas of the South.

But keep pedalling the lies, it's all you idiots can do.

Wrong. The various African wars of the past twenty years have caused huge damage to infrastructure, as has to a lesser extent the Sri Lankan conflict.

 
2. Yes there was deliberate killing of civilians and israel does have a motive: terrorizing the lebanese public. The latest UN report accused israel of the deliberate targeting of civilians.
 

If I accuse you of murder, that doesn't in itself make you a murderer. Even if, as is regrettably probable, the IDF contains its fair share of b*****ds like any other army, that's a far cry from accusing the entire country of deliberately targetting civilians. Quite apart from that, simply saying "yes there was deliberate killing of civilians" does not in itself consitute proof. And terrorising people, thereby increasing the already considerable animosity towards Israel that exists in the region, is hardly a motive.

 
3. Please, quit using silly comparisons. The IDF chief, the leader of a war machine, threatening to bring back a country 20 years in history is nothing like anyone on TSR saying anything. The guy has power to destroy lebanon and he did.
 

Wrong. Simply hugely factually wrong. The Lebanon still exists and still functions as a country, proving the initial fears of many people, including myself, to be largely groundless.

Lie. Israel has never even admitted that it HAS nuclear weapons. How do you threaten someone with something whilst simultaneously refusing to say if you have it or not? Israel has never ever issued an explicit nuclear threat against anywhere in the Middle East, especially not Lebanon. Indeed, if you used the mind I presume you have, then you would know that Israel couldn't nuke Lebanon without getting a crapload of radiation blown straight back across Israel. Not to mention that unless Israel struck further North than the South of Lebanon, Israel itself would probably be in the blast radius.

Yes they did. It is acknowledged by pretty much everyone that Hezbollah's kidnapping and killing of Israeli soldiers was an act of war - it's impossible to say otherwise. Thus, Israel was justified in fighting back as it saw fit. When will you get this?

What warped braindead analysis is that? That's like saying after Germany invaded Poland that Poland attacking Germany back was "an act of war" - it's patently clear that a war has ALREADY been STARTED. Once a war has begun, the other side can fight that war - only the original act is classified as "an act of war" and that was Hezbollah's action. To argue otherwise is absolutely disingenuous and counter-factual.

Would you like to explain why Hezbollah smuggles it's weapons if they're legal?

Aww.   Well, nice to see we're saying pretty much exactly the same things.

Israel is believed to possess the largest and most sophisticated arsenal outside of the five declared nuclear powers. Israel has never admitted possessing nuclear weapons, but abundant information is available showing that the capability exists.

Hezbollah did not start the war. Hezbollah did not start rocketing into Israel, Firstly Israel started shelling Lebanon. Hezbollah doesnt occupy Israeli territory, but Israel constantly occupies Lebanese areas and has been illegally using up the Lebanons ports.

Why would Israel want to terrorize the Lebanese public? You tell us since your are closer to the Zionists. If its not Israels motive to terrorize the Lebanese public then why have they terrorized them and Lebanon as a country? and dont reply with -well Israel hasnt terrorised Lebanon- or any crap similar to that because they have been terrorizing Lebanon for DECADES.

No he isn't claiming that they don't have nuclear weapons, he is pointing out that they aren't using them as a means of cowering the other nations in the area, they don't even admit they have them.

So, Israel has proved itself responsible enough to be allowed nuclear weapons. After all it has been involved in several wars in recent years and at no point has it resorted to using them.

 
Hezbollah did not start the war. Hezbollah did not start rocketing into Israel, Firstly Israel started shelling Lebanon. Hezbollah doesnt occupy Israeli territory, but Israel constantly occupies Lebanese areas and has been illegally using up the Lebanons ports.
 

Wrong just wrong. Actually read up on the conflict before shooting your mouth off. Provide evidence for any of this.

I agree with your points but this is somewhat faulty reasoning. Could Israel use nuclear weapons on the Palestinians and the Lebanese without causing its own citizens muchos grief?
 
 
What annoys me is that after all these years of clearly having nuclear weapons and not going crazy with them, Israel STILL refuses, when officially questioned, to say anything other than "maybe   ".

Of course Hizbullah doesn't occupy anything. There's not enough of them, which is the whole reason they resort to, haha, "unconventional warfare" in the first place.

From Wikipedia: "The conflict began when Hezbollah initiated a diversionary Katyusha rocket and mortar attack on Israeli military positions and border villages, while another Hezbollah unit conducted a cross-border raid and captured two Israeli soldiers. Israel responded with massive airstrikes and artillery fire on the Lebanese civilian infrastructure, which it was claimed members of the Hezbollah militia were using, an air and naval blockade and a ground invasion of southern Lebanon."

Prove it.

Keep your hair on. I'm not going to use the word "terrorise", because it's too close to "terrorist". But in any war people are terr ified by what goes on, and this one was certainly no exception. What I don't think happened, which you seem to, is that the Israelis sat down and deliberately planned to scare people as an end in itself, not as a byproduct of the fighting. There is no sensible reason why Israel would want to do so.

Not at all. But Israel maintains ambiguity on the issue - if it was intent on THREATENING, it would just say, "we have nuclear weapons", not refuse to confirm it. My point is not that Israel does not have nuclear weapons, I believe it does. My point is that it does not threaten to use them.

Wrong again. The Hezbollah attack which resulted in the killing and kidnapping of the Israeli soldiers was carried out under cover of a Hezbollah barrage on Israel. Anyway, that is irrelevant, because the act of war was constituted by the kidnap. Once that took place - there was a war begun, and any Israeli action was part of that war.

It's laughable the way you cling to this pathetic "Israel fired the first rocket" line, which besides from being untrue, wouldn't actually alter the fact that Hezbollah began the war through its kidnapping, even if it was true.

What are you on about. Israel withdrew from Lebanon in 2000 - from that moment on it occupied no Lebanese territory, so where do you get this "constantly occupies Lebanese areas" crap from? And what the hell does "illegally using up the Lebanese ports" mean? How do you "use up" a port?

There you are ladies and gentlemen. He cannot provide a motive. His only tactic is to assert that it happened and that Israel does it because it's simply evil.

It doesn't have much of a choice. If it admits to having them then idiots, like those above, will go "OMG ISRAEL THREATENING US".

Actually, what I find amusing is that, whilst the whole world knows Israel have nukes, the Arab world doesn't actually seem frightened enough to start building their own in any concerted effort. You'd think if Israel was as bad as they make out, then they'd be freaking out and scrabbling for nukes - but they aren't. However, when I read up on Iran, it seems to be quite a common view amongst the experts that if Iran goes nuclear then countries such as Egypt (who used to have a nuclear program) and Saudi will be worried enough to start going after nukes full-scale too. Which basically means, the Arab world is more scared of Iranian nukes than of Israeli ones - probably because they know that in reality, Israel is a sensible, modern, stable country whereas Iran is in the hands of a bunch of apocalyptic, religious-nutcase theocrats.

True but they also showed the same restraint against Egypt in the six day war.
 
 
So the Arab world is worried enough about Iran to consider Iranian nukes to be a threat to themselves? Good. International-community-wise, that's just what we want.

However, that's not the topic.

If Israel comes out and admits it has nukes, there will of course be no end of fuss. However, de facto everyone knows it does, so said fuss will be purely superficial. Hopefully. Additionally, on the honesty side of things it would give Israel's international image a bit of a polish. Because it could say "Look, we had nukes for x years and did no harm to anyone with them". Which is pretty strong evidence for the credentials you mention, when you consider the reasons given against Iran and North Korea mainly consist of pointing out that they are NOT, as nations, wonderfully stable, sane or whatever.

This comment is only valid really if you ignore the fact Israel kidnapped and killed Hezb soldiers before the Hezb operation to negotiate with the IDF in prisoner exchanges took place. And the kidnapping of reservist soldiers did in no way justify Israels response to Lebanon since you obviously wouldnt accept if Hezb had Israels rocketing ability and carried out airstrikes all over Israel because of the mere point that 2 of their soldiers where kidnapped by Israeli rebels for negotiations and prisoner exchange purposes.

When will you stop lying? proved itself responsible ?. Israel believes that the Holocaust justified any measures it took to ensure its survival. They are not responsible enough and certainly have not proved themselves responsible for having nuclear weapons.

What are you talking about? You seem to be on the same list of the many idiots who deny that this conflict started when Israel first occupied Lebanon. Are you challenging the fact Hezbollah was a regime (back then) born to defend Lebanon/the Lebanese people from the Israelis who invaded their land?
 
 
And while we are on the Nuclear issue I would like to know why Vanunu was Jailed for 18 YEARS for revealing Israels nuclear secrets? It was that bad that Vanunu converted himself to Christianity and im sure this all means something. (specifically why Vanunu was Jailed for 18 years)

Unless anyone here would like to confirm to me that Israels nuclear development doesn’t include the agenda to threaten/wipe out any Arab state that gets in her way?

It appears you are illiterate. Either that or you can't understand basic English.
He says: "he isnt claiming that they dont have nuclear weapons"
You respond with: "how can he claim they don't"

Let me re-iterate what Nefarious said, he said (accurately): "HE ISN'T CLAIMING THEY DON'T"

Responding with "how can he claim they don't", doesn't make any sense.

How dumb can you be?

1. What does "get in her way" mean? Get in her way of living in secure borders?
2. The fact that they won't even admit they have nuclear weapons puts a damper on the whole "threatening" idea. Look at Israel comparatively with North Korea - N. Korea yells from the rooftops that it has nukes. That's threatening. Israel goes "we're not saying if we do or don't". That's not threatening anyone.
 
 
Wow. What is the above person going on about? I said how could he claim that Israel didnt have NWs [as in anyway] when its sooo obvious that they have. What I find extremely annoying is that you quote that part of my post which had the least relevance in this thread and then try to diss my English, i mean get a life, ****ing moron.
 
 
Oh lord. You still don't understand. How is that possible? I explained it in terms a chimp would understand. Let's try again:

I and Nefarious have now BOTH told you that I was not claiming Israel doesn't have nuclear weapons, but was commenting on their not "threatening" with them.

But you keep saying "how can he claim Israel doesn't have nukes" - a claim that I and Nefarious have both told you I didn't make.

Is this penetrating? I mean, is English actually a language you speak?

I love how you claim to know what Israel "believes". You can't even provide a motive for actions you falsely claim it takes and now we're meant to believe you know what is thought? Hah.

Surely having them for decades and not even threatening to use them shows some degree of responsibility...
 
 
What sense does but was commenting on their not threatening with them make? no sense actually. This is terrible English coming from someone who is trying to correct my English!  

I posted how can he claim (puts anyway here) when its so obvious Israel has them. I honestly dont see what part of this you are finding so hard to understand. Are you that stupid?

LMAO. And then he asks is English a language I speak.
 
 
How is it possible that you still don't understand?

Nefarious and I have said: JonathanH did not claim Israel does not have nuclear weapons and if you read his posts, that is clear.

And in response to that,

789 has said: How can he [meaning JonathanH] claim that Israel didnt have NWs when its sooo obvious that they have.

Let's open this up to the floor. For all you non-chimps out there, is there something particularly difficult to understand in what I'm saying? Read my last few posts - is there something incredibly challenging to understand in the point I'm making?
 
 
This is getting old now. Seriously - stop being a clown. I explained that I posted how can he claim (puts anyway here) when its so obvious Israel has them (meaning the nuc,bombs). There is nothing to debate about this so maybe take a hint (move on?). Are you that stupid?

What I find extremely funny is that you are trying to correct my English when your English seems to be infant level compared to mine.  

Back to my question. What sense did but was commenting on their not threatening with them make? This is terrible English coming from someone who is trying to correct my English right?

What is wrong with you? He is not claiming Israel doesn't have them, he is saying that Israel has never disclosed that they do:

Now, if Israel wont even admit to having nukes, how exactly are they able to threaten using them?
 
 
Thank you! I knew what I was saying wasn't difficult to grasp!

How great, another noob (^above^) who forgets to read before posting a random comment.

For your information there is nothing wrong with me. Israel wont admit (though its not denying) having nukes but in the most sensible peoples minds Israel does have nuclear weapons and for your information nobody here is denying this.

Would anyone here confirm to me that Israels nuclear development doesn’t include the agenda to threaten/wipe out any Arab state that are in its way?
 
 
Yes, I am a n00b. That's why I have damn' near 7k posts (almost exclusively racked up in D&D, I might add   ) and the power to BAN YOU!!!111111one

 

I think this has gone on long enough. 789, take a good look at whatever post this first came up in, and think about it slowly. You've been missing the point for a good two or three pages now.

Yes, Israel have never once threatened anyone with their non-existent, from what we know, nuclear weapons.

Im gonna stop posting on this thread because im getting warnigns here and there, in my opinion, for no reason (or maybe for my views?) and i dont wanna get banned soo..

Cya guys later.
 
 
I seem to remember dismembering your whole "kidnapping" argument and ridiculing the whole basis of this topic as being baselessly hysterical and absurdly unimportant, all without reply. I also seem to remember numerous people mocking your absence of reason or rationality and your absurd and palpably false claims.
 
 
Umm.. i still firmly believe those civilians were kidnapped by israeli terrorists and yes, it falls under the definition of kidnapping because..

let me remind you that kidnapping can include kidnapping to 'terrorize' people.. not only for 'ransom' like you stated, and thats precisely the objective which the terrorists are after - therefor, it is infact kidnapping.

Hehe. Like all your pronouncements, you have to absolutely distort every facet of the issue then expand definitions out of all plausible recognition in order to make your point. I love this "kidnapping to terrorise" idea and how you just invent entirely new concepts in order to justify your absurd statements.
Firstly, let's deal with what happened. Israeli forces detained several men, questioned them and then released them again, unharmed, in a matter of hours without demanding a single thing in return. That is not kidnapping - that is something that sounds like an entirely reasonable precautionary measure to me when dealing with something suspicious. Kidnapping is taking the person away and either demanding something in return or for some nefarious purpose such as rape. Clearly nothing was demanded and nothing done to the men and there was no intention to demand or do anything bad to them. Thus, calling it "kidnapping" is simpyl baseless.
Secondly, this idea that that somehow constitutes "terrorism". Well, even if we expand the definition of terrorism outwards to "something that terrorises" people - that was clearly neither what happened nor the Israeli intention. If Israel wanted, as you so often bizarrely claim, to "terrorise" Lebanon (for some reason that you've never provided) - surely they must have better ways of doing it then detaining and then releasing unharmed, several men. That doesn't sound like "terrorising" to me - there was no violence, no threats of violence, no injuries, no damage, nothing. In fact, it's hard to see any element of "terrorising" at all, within any definition. And indeed, the whole episode was peacefully resolved before you even began the topic.
Everyone who's not a raving Israel-hater can see what you have done is to pile lie on lie and exaggerate and distort events to try and launch an unjustified attack on Israel. This seems to be your primary activity on this board, and people are getting very tired of it. When I see previously neutral people start dismissing what you say and complaining about your distortion and lies, it becomes clear to me that, simply put, no-one is buying it. You have no credibility because your irrational hatred is so palpable - even to those who have no attachment to Israel.

And if you want to believe you won, go ahead, you're only fooling urself  .. and believe it or not, most people in the world do believe that your country is a terrorist state. You posting on TSR wont change a thing.. even bush and blair's blind support for you wont change a thing. The bottom line is that one day, when all the money your zionist lobbies have in america evaporates, you're gonna end up with no1 in the world supporting you. So fix your country's terrorist policies now and persue just peace before its too late.

I dream of the day where israel and its neighbours can live side by side, in peace, with everyone's rights respected but make no mistake, i wouldnt want peaceful coexistence if everyone's rights werent given to them (including israel's rights) and i wudnt want a shameful solution for the arabs. The struggle for a just and lasting peace will continue.. and like Mr. Galloway said: No justice, no peace. Its that simple.

 

First of all, I don't own the country so stop with the "your country." It really doesn't do your "argument" justice. Most people in the world believe Israel is a terrorist state? Yeah, and I'm the pope. Do you have any sort of evidence for this absolute fallacy or is this just in your own "ideal" world. And because most people apparently think it's a terrorist state it means it's true? Most people think suicide bombers are terrorists - I bet you're not going to agree with that one.  

Again- "my Zionist lobbies in America"? Huh. Sorry but I wasn't aware I owned any Zionist lobbies. Anyone who starts off with these lobbies in America, quite frankly, isn't worth speaking to.
 
 
Yes, those were released unharmed, but how do u know they werent threatened or verbally abused by the IDF terrorists?

Furthermore, those 6 were unharmed, however, there are thousands of others who are still in israel dungeons. Those weren't lucky enuff to 'leave quickly unharmed'

oh and btw.. they were kidnapped for a whole day. And Israel does employ a variety of different terrorizing techniques such as.. :

1- Bombings civilian infrastructure
2- Kidnapping civilians
3- Threatening to bomb out entire towns through leaflets
4- Have its terror chief verbally terrorize the lebanese public by threatening to 'bring back the country 20 years' which surely means attacking more than military targets.
5- Using cluster bombs in civilian areas
6- Delibrately target civilians (as was shown in the latest UN report which i have made a seperate thread for earlier)

All of those tactics are used by Israel to change the public's perception of hezbullah and make it seem like hezbullah are the cause behind all the attacks against them.

Surely, that shows how Israel employs military operations against civilians to change their political views, which is, under any definition, terrorism. In other words, israel tries to change the public's view to make the resistence look 'too costly'.. which is quite reminscent of bin laden's tactics of attacking civilians in madrid and london to make the war in iraq look 'too costly' and therefor make them change their opinion about it.

First of all, you know what i mean by saying you and your but you are delibrately misunderstanding it for the sake of arguing.

Secondly, I believe that suicide bombers within israel's 1948 borders are actually terrorists but those outisde the borders are infact freedom fighters because under international legitimacy israel should have the 1948 borders and until there is a resolution annexing the new land grabs by israel, those people will contionue to be freedom fighters.

Great, so stop talking to me. Theres an easy function on TSR which you can use.. and you wouldnt see any of my rubbish at all.

And yes, I do believe that zionist lobby groups control american politics because without their dollars and support, hardly anyone can become president. Clearly, there has to be a reason behind america's blind support for israel (which is evident where they veto every resolution against israel most of them where the SC would be unanimously for the resolution without the US veto). I see that reason being the lobby groups as there are no clear cultural or political links or any rational links between the US and Israel which we can attribute the blind support to.

Because I have no need to deal with your completely absurd rants, because the conclusion I've come to, is that... no-one's buying it except those who held your absurd ideas before. No-one impartial is being convinced by you. So, this'll be my last response. You can respond if you want (not that your responses are ever more than blind repetition of things you've said before), but it might be a waste of time.

1. This use of "dungeons" - quite amusing, but Israeli prisons are not "dungeons". In fact, prisoners are given meals, healthcare and even religious freedoms in Israeli prisons. I know you love to use the word "dungeons" to paint a false picture, but it's not true.
2. This whole discussion has been based on Lebanon, no? And Israel, even according to Lebanese sources, holds only 3/4 Lebanese. So these thousands are who exactly?

Note the incredible inversion here. Israel drops leaflets warning people that, for their own safety, they should try and leave so that they aren't harmed by Israeli strikes. That is something that, looked at objectively, is a humanitarian gesture. But to the mind of this fool, that becomes a "threatening" piece of "terrorism".

Anyway, once again, an allegation is not proof, especially one that comes from the UN and is regarding Israel. Looking objectively at the conflict, it is apparent to most that Israel did not deliberately target civilians and that there would be absolutely no military or other benefit for them to do so.

Wow. That takes "tenuous" to a whole new plane. And the whole purpose of such a statement is, as usual, to try and establish a link between Israel and terrorism, and frankly you attempts are getting more and more tenuous, exaggerated, and laughable each time you try. The way you have to expand definitions, twist events and generally deceive on a grand scale to try and make reality fit your preconceived conclusion is quite clear.

Once again, utterly twisting the reality and drawing absurd parallels between two hugely different situations in order to fit a conclusion that he has already decided upon and now is scrabbling to support anyway he can. Desperate and pathetic. Apparently, Israel bombing a terrorist group, Hezbollah, in Lebanon and trying to end their support is equivalent to the terrorist attacks in Madrid and London? Am I the only one who just isn't buying it. Because I do get the feeling I'm in the solid majority on this one - no-one is going for the crap you're selling.

My proof:

Also worth mentioning are the inhumane conditions by which those people are held under.

Ok well,, jonathan made a huge reply to my posts.. and anyone who reads it clearly sees how he has hardly made ANY replies to my arguments. Instead, he has insulted me and attempted to mock the arguments in a very silly fashion.

However, he made a few, limited poitns which i will respond to:

Firstly, concerning the israeli prisons - he has stated that the prisoners are treated well. Heres a small part of an article on BBC, written in 2003, supporting my claims:

 http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3130623.stm 

There are also at least 530 "administrative detainees" in IDF custody, who are held without charge or trial for renewable six-month terms.

Prison conditions

Living conditions for prisoners are generally described by observers as extremely harsh and difficult.

Human Rights Watch says the 4,500 Palestinians arrested in the massive military sweep through the West Bank in March-April 2002 were subjected to widespread ill-treatment such as kicking, beatings, squalid conditions and deprivation of food and drink.

Visits by families are hampered by travel restrictions imposed on all Palestinians, the prisoners' support group Addameer says, with inhabitants of the West Bank towns of Nablus and Jenin denied access to jailed relatives since May 2000 - that is four months before the intifada even started.

But the most controversial issue remains Israel's reported use of physical and psychological pressure during interrogations of prisoners, a practice internationally condemned as torture by the United Nations and human rights groups.

Israel's High Court outlawed the use of what was termed "moderate physical pressure" of prisoners in September 1999, but the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel says interrogators have gradually reverted to techniques that amount to torture.

According to human rights groups, these include beating, leaving prisoners in uncomfortable postures, interrogation sessions which last 24 or 48 hours, depriving prisoners of sleep, depriving them of human dignity and making threats against the lives and property of their relatives.

But Israel defends its interrogation techniques - as it defends the whole edifice of legal and penal mechanisms it uses in relation to the Palestinians - as a legitimate way of combating terrorism faced by its citizens.

-------------------------------------------------

Im glad that you brought up the topic to make me do some research which has infact added a new thing to my list:

-Israel tortures palestenian prisoners on a regular basis, according to human rights watch.

Ok sorry i was rudely interrupted by someoen trying to make me look like an idiot.

Anyways back to Jonathan's post:

"It's not terrorism for a State to use legal munitions during a war."

Legal? Cluster bombs are illegal in civilian areas. Period. Do some research.

" Could you put the link here"

No, you can look it up in my other thread. Its on the first page. Also, i have shown more instances of human rights abuses by the terrorists in israel.

"Scraping the barrel are we? OMG, an Israeli military leader made a military threat during a time of war! The whole idea of war rhetoric is absolutely lost on you, isn't it? "

Military threats to military installations is one thing and threatening to 'bring back the country 20 years' is another. Surely, when you say you want to bring the country back 20 years it means you are going to attack more than military targets and the statement was clearly made in the hope of terrorizing the lebanese public to submission.

Indeed. And given the amount of palestinian terrorism that Israel has faced, that hardly seems like an unreasonable amount to have been involved in terrorism.

Israel withdrew from Lebanon in 2000 - effectively ending that period of warfare. Hezbollah started a new war in 2006 - this is the one we are talking about. Trying to blame this war on Israel would be like trying to say that in 1951 it would have been legitimate for the US to just bomb Japan out of the blue, because they had been at war before.

 
Originally Posted by 789654123

And we are back to a point that you never seem to understand. She never challenged the idea that Israel has nuclear weapons - she thinks they do. She challenges the idea that Israel uses such weapons to threaten Arab States - and as her evidence she uses the fact that Israel, far from threatening to use nuclear weapons, will not even admit to owning them.

 
Originally Posted by 789654123

Comparatively to what? They came out of the war faring a lot better than Hezbollah in terms of losses.

Many people thinking something doesn't make it so. Many people think Israel is not a terrorist state and would reject such a contention utterly. Many people also think Elvis lives. Many people believing something - especially when many of those doing believing have an ingrained hatred of the target of their beliefs - proves nothing.

The King David Hotel bombing was carried out in 1946. Israel was founded in 1948. By definition, Israel could not have been responsible for the bombing, because of the fantastic alibi of IT NOT EXISTING yet. Not to mention that the action was condemned by Jewish groups and the mainstream Zionist leadership.
 
 
oh and guess what!! i got you a source from your own ally.. the almighty US of A:

 http://www.thejerusalemfund.org/imag...ief.php?ID=132 

Read the article, however, i find somethign very interesting, worth highligting:

Torture, Inhumane or Degrading Treatment

The U.S. government report states that "some" members of Israel's security forces abuse Palestinian detainees. However, according to the Israeli Human Rights group B'Tselem, in Israel, "for years, torture was commonly used by Israel's General Security Service (GSS) interrogators. Since 1987, the GSS interrogated at least 850 Palestinians a year by means of torture. The methods included violent shaking, binding the detainees in painful positions, and covering their head with a foul-smelling sack. All governmental authorities—from the Israeli army to the Supreme Court—took part in approving torture, in developing new methods, and in supervising them."

Oh and guess what as well.. read my previous post about the big number of palestenian prisoners held under 'administrative' detentions? well read this from the source ive shown:

Administrative detentions and imprisonment of Palestinians from the Occupied Territories inside Israel are both illegal under the Fourth Geneva Convention.

According to Article 76: "Protected persons accused of offences shall be detained in the occupied country, and if convicted they shall serve their sentences therein. They shall, if possible, be separated from other detainees and shall enjoy conditions of food and hygiene which will be sufficient to keep them in good health, and which will be at least equal to those obtaining in prisons in the occupied country."

Furthermore, Palestinian prisoners are routinely tortured by Israel and held in detention centers and prisons that do not meet the minimum international standards and are routinely denied visitation rights. Article 1 of the Convention defines torture as "any act by which sever pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or confession...."

So you are automatically assuming that my attempt will be debunked by someone else? I feel sorry for you that you cant think for yourself and instead you use other people's arguments.

It doesnt matter how rational my arguments are, you are automatically goign to assume they are wrong because of your evident bias against my issue. Obviously, you are hiding under a veil which won't let you go to the outside world and think for yourself.

This is the best they can do? Simply using what prisoners claim happened? And once again - we are given no context at all - did these prisoners resist? Did they try and escape? Did they deserve punishment? All we have here is an utterly unverifiable assertion - this is not evidence.

And of course, you left out the ISraeli response in the article:

"A senior Israeli military source admitted to BBC News Online that overcrowding was a problem, but categorically denied any maltreatment.

Prisoners received exactly the same medical attention as Israeli soldiers, and Ketziot prison - for example - has just had $5m spent on it to deal with some of the accommodation problems, the source said. "

Notice the huge leap made here. We have what is described as "physical and psychological pressure" and then we have such things denounced as "torture". Now, not all physical and psychological pressure is torture - especially when you are dealing with terrorists who may have information vital to national security. Under such circumstances, using "pressure" is commonplace around the world - it is simply something required when information is needed and a prisoner refuses to give it. It surprises me not one jot that Human Rights groups object - they object to anything and everything without the barest recognition of reality.

See, Israeli courts have even outlawed such practices, showing that the Israeli justice system actually acts for the prisoners.

Hehe. According to HRW. Here, I can go one better "Israel is the root of all evil and has no right to defend itself according to human rights watch" - because that's what most of their opinions amount to.

Bias  

When I was fairly new to D&D I actually had an argument with JonathanH about the basis of Israel’s existence, I still have some disagreements with him on that issue. I regularly state that I am unhappy with the amount of collateral damage Israeli forces have caused. On the other hand my lack of bias allows me to identify quite easily who the real terrorists are in this particular situation.

Hehe. Wow, that was pretty dumb. In case people don't notice - this is not a source from any ally of Israel. This is actually a source from a group called the "The Jerusalem Fund". A quick perusal of their site, reveals that their objectives include:
"The Palestine Center’s purpose is to bring together people and resources within the American and Palestinian communities to educate about Palestine and the Palestinian people’s ongoing quest for sovereignty on their land, civil and political rights and an end to Israeli occupation."

Also, you will note their site contains only Arabic and English writing. Also, their board is entirely comprised, from what I can ascertain, of Arabs/Muslims.

So, what do we really have? Simply put, they're a pro-palestinian advocacy group.

And yet the poster claims it's a source from "your own ally... the USA". This site has no more relevance to the US than, say Michael Moore's does - it doesn't represent the US government, US institutions or anything other than private individuals who happen to reside in the US.

Need I point to any more evidence of the brazen and all-consuming deception that this person uses when dealing with Israel?

What a weak response. Ive pointed out sources and sources and more sources of prisoners, observers, human rights activists and even american government reports which highlight the torture used against prisoners.

And lets make one thing clear. Under the geneva convention, you're not allowed to torture anyone, regardless of what crime they have commited. I know the geneva convention is distorted in israel but this is reality.

Before you start ranting on about what pressure means, read how israel is accused of actual torture by the US government and by Human rights watch and many other human rights organizations.

Ok first you ask me for sources, so i bring an internationally known, well respect human rights organization and you automatically discredit its views. Im sorry but theres not much mroe I can do to show you that you are wrong. Ive brought you sources from unbiased organizations and people but you still discredit them.

Whats more worrying is your complete ignorance of the issue of 'administrative detention', banned by the geneva convention and used by israel continously.

Oh and btw.. nice use of the ignore button

I know that it quoted the US government at some points, I can read, but it uses the US government report in a limited fashion and most of the article is either its own views or quotes from other parties.

For example, the first point that you cited runs thus:
"The U.S. government report states that "some" members of Israel's security forces abuse Palestinian detainees. However, according to the Israeli Human Rights group B'Tselem, in Israel, "for years etc."

So, the vast majority of what is said in your first accusation is not citing the US government report AT ALL - it is citing a completely different source.

The second point does not cite the US government report at all - it is simply the views of the group whose site it is.

Thus "the source" that you cited was not the US government report, the "source" was the website that you cited - and you portrayed that as being associated with the US, when all it had done was use the report in an immensely limtied fashion.
 
 
From human rights watch:  http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/08/02/lebano13902.htm 

"(Beirut, August 3, 2006) – Israeli forces have systematically failed to distinguish between combatants and civilians in their military campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon, Human Rights Watch said in report released today. The pattern of attacks in more than 20 cases investigated by Human Rights Watch researchers in Lebanon indicates that the failures cannot be dismissed as mere accidents and cannot be blamed on wrongful Hezbollah practices. In some cases, these attacks constitute war crimes."

"“The pattern of attacks shows the Israeli military’s disturbing disregard for the lives of Lebanese civilians,” said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. “Our research shows that Israel’s claim that Hezbollah fighters are hiding among civilians does not explain, let alone justify, Israel’s indiscriminate warfare.”

The report is based on extensive interviews with victims and witnesses of attacks, visits to some blast sites, and information obtained from hospitals, humanitarian groups, security forces and government agencies. Human Rights Watch also conducted research in Israel, assessing the weapons used by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). "

-----

Beforee you start saying that hezbullah are hiding in those 'homes', I find this particularly disturbing:

The Israeli government has blamed Hezbollah for the high civilian casualty toll in Lebanon, insisting that Hezbollah fighters have hidden themselves and their weapons among the civilian population. However, in none of the cases of civilian deaths documented in the report is there evidence to suggest that Hezbollah was operating in or around the area during or prior to the attack.

“Hezbollah fighters must not hide behind civilians – that’s an absolute – but the image that Israel has promoted of such shielding as the cause of so high a civilian death toll is wrong,” Roth said. “In the many cases of civilian deaths examined by Human Rights Watch, the location of Hezbollah troops and arms had nothing to do with the deaths because there was no Hezbollah around.”

"Many civilians are afraid to leave the south because the roads are under Israeli attack. Hundreds of thousands of Lebanese have fled their homes, but Israeli forces have fired with warplanes and artillery on dozens of civilian vehicles, many flying white flags. Israel has justified its attacks on roads by citing the need to target Hezbollah fighters moving arms and block their transport routes.

However, none of the evidence gathered by Human Rights Watch or reported to date by independent media sources indicate that any of the attacks on vehicles documented in the report resulted in Hezbollah casualties or the destruction of weapons. Rather, the attacks have killed and wounded civilians who were fleeing their homes after the IDF issued instructions to evacuate.
"

-----------------------

And even mroe disturbing, some examples of israel's war crimes:

In one case, an Israeli air strike on July 13 destroyed the home of a cleric known to have sympathy for Hezbollah but who was not known to have taken any active part in the hostilities. Even if the IDF considered him a legitimate target (and Human Rights Watch has no evidence that he was), the strike killed him, his wife, their 10 children and the family’s Sri Lankan maid.

On July 16, an Israeli aircraft fired on a civilian home in the village of Aitaroun, killing 11 members of the al-Akhrass family, among them seven Canadian-Lebanese dual nationals who were vacationing in the village when the war began. Human Rights Watch independently interviewed three villagers who vigorously denied that the family had any connection to Hezbollah. Among the victims were children aged one, three, five and seven.

------------------------

There we go, I have presented you with arguments from a human rights organization, who has studied, in depth, the conditions around the perceived 'military' targets in lebanon but has not foudn the slightest evidence of hezbullah's presence anywhere in the proximitry of the bombed houses.

Furthermore, the report accuses israel of delibrately targeting civilians and it clearly shows how, in most cases, israel's bombs fell on civilians and caused civilian casualties and the same time, very few, actually hit hezbullah targets.

Im off to sleep now. Enuff ownage  
 
 
Finally, beofre i go to bed.. id like to point out how ive clearly shown, according to observer sources which is not a side in the conflict (HRW), israel engaged in deliberate targetting of civilians. It has also engaged in collective punishment of families of clerics who have sympathy for hezbullah. This is clearly terrorism as israel is attempting to terrorize lebanese people by killing the civilians and by killing clerics and their families who have sympathy for the resistence group.

JonH responded to my posts after claiming he blocked me: clearly contradictig himself.

And yes, you are right. I shouldn't flame them but because of all the insults i received from them, I have, unfortunately scooped down to their level of insulting people. I will quit flaming them from now onwards. Thank you for highliting this to me.

I doubt it. The article/report was written for the general public, most of whom will have no experience at all of the conditions inside prisons. Thus using the words "harsh" and "difficult" in a comparative sense to other prisons would be worthless, as the vast majority of people could not relate - rendering the words meaningless. So what makes the most sense is using those words in relation to everyday life - which people can relate to.
See, that's what logic is ^

No. You have pointed out prisoners, human rights groups and a pro-palestinian group. I have shown above how you were NOT quoting the US government report at all, but a completely different source.

I don't think the things described amount to torture. Anyway, the Geneva Conventions date from over half a century ago - they have hardly any relevance to modern warfare and cannot even begin to relate to terrorism and other such issues. They are badly outmoded - the world needs an update. Trying to insist people stick, in this time of international terrorism, to rules constructed 50+ years ago to govern State-on-State conflict is quite absurd.

HRW?! Respected?! HRW, like Amnesty, has no credibility left with much of the world, having sacrificed it's Human Rights credentials on the alter of an anti-US, anti-Israel leftist political agenda. It has been hijacked, like many rights groups, by those who wish to use it to push their views and agenda - which is why they spend a disproportionate amount of time and venom on things done by the US and Israel. I have no respect for such groups, and nor does virtually anyone who understands their politicised agenda.

All that is according to the pro-palestinian group you cited before. Israel has long argued that the territories do not match the criteria for the GC's to apply.

Oh and btw.. nice use of the ignore button   [/QUOTE]
 
 
One last thing, Im bringing an article from amnesty international concerning israel's human rights violations as well:

 http://www.amnestyusa.org/countries/...ies/summary.do 
Over 8000 Palestinians, most of whom are nonviolent prisoners of conscience and few if any of whom have received trials that meet international standards, are being held as political prisoners. Over the past five years, close to 20,000 Palestinians have been made homeless and thousands of others have lost their livelihood as the Israeli army has destroyed over 4,000 homes, vast areas of agricultural land and hundreds of other properties.

The construction of the fence/wall inside the Occupied Territories violates international law, is based on land confiscation and is causing grave human rights violations. In addition, military checkpoints, blockades and a barrage of other restrictions confine Palestinians to their homes or immediate surroundings. As a result, the Palestinian economy has virtually collapsed.

-----------

In short, israel is violation international law by having a large number of prisoners of conscience, most of whom have received no trials. It is also violating international law by building the fence.

Another two blatant violations of international law by Israel. Truely Shameful.

Goodnight.
 
 
Torture should never become legal JonH. Torture is a backward way of reasoning and should be avioded at all costs. It's just unhumanitarian, and unethical to say the least. :wtf?:
 
 
Quickly reading jonathan's post, now that there is no way for him to counter the notion that israel is commiting war crimes, he wants to change the laws governing 'war crimes' and change what 'human rights' are and change the geneva convention, accepted by most countries around the world as a legal basis to the basic rights of human beings during the times of conflict.

Great. I rest my case.
 
 
Thank you for showing everyone how pathetically biased and agenda-pushing HRW are. Their report is palpable nonsense - self-confessedly based almost solely on what the Lebanese told them. Not to mention the investigations being conducted after the conflict was over. Which means such idiotic statements as "in none of the cases of civilian deaths documented in the report is there evidence to suggest that Hezbollah was operating in or around the area during or prior to the attack." are possible. Come on, is anyone buying that in NONE of the cases were Hezbollah operating in the area? What about in Bint Jbail? What about in the Southern suburbs of Beirut? Those areas are almost exclusively Hezbollah - and they're telling me that they couldn't find any evidence of Hezbollah operating amongst the people there? Pull the other one. Anyway, how is it possible to know where Hezbollah was operating during the conflict when you are investigating once its over? It's not like Hezbollah conducted all attacks from fixed locations - the whole basis of their strategy was moving equipment about and firing from different places. So once the conflict's over, it's nice and easy to just shift the weaponry out of civilian areas - and presto - "in none of the cases of civilian deaths documented in the report is there evidence to suggest that Hezbollah was operating in or around the area during or prior to the attack". Of course there isn't - they've got rid of the evidence and none of the Lebanese are going to claim that they were operating in civilian areas - that'd look bad.

I have two explanations - 1. The report is just fantasy - as I said before, a product of the HRW's ingrained anti-Israel agenda. or 2. Hezbollah has simply cleaned up any remnants of itself. Wouldn't be too hard, considering that the investigations were conducted only after the conflict ended - Hezbollah had adequate time to simply remove or hide any remnants of its weaponry. Not to mention the fact that Hezbollah still runs many areas that were targeted - meaning the investigators were unlikely to have had any significant freedom of movement.

In conclusion - that report is a joke, that just demonstrates my point - "Human Rights" groups just haven't got a clue anymore.

There we go, much better.

Citation to back up your claim of this bias would do your argument the world of good. It would certainly shut up anyone with even the slightest ability to comprehend a rational argument.

Now that is ownage.
 
 
What are you talking about? Ownage? how is it ownage??

the NGO monitor's declared aim is to contradict anti-israeli reports and its staff is all jewish. I dont know how that can be taken as a source.. Jonathan automatically discredits any source which has arab/muslim staff.

frontpagemag: "Steven Plaut is a professor at the Graduate School of the Business Administration at the University of Haifa and is a columnist for the Jewish Press. A collection of his commentaries on the current events in Israel can be found on his "blog" at".

Clearly, again, the writer is a jew therefor it is not a reliable source, taking jonathan's definition of 'reliability' (where he discredited my arab/muslim sources)

ADL: "The immediate object of the League is to stop, by appeals to reason and conscience and, if necessary, by appeals to law, the defamation of the Jewish people."

Clearly, again, its staff are jews trying to stop any accusations against jews.

and finally, the last article posted is by Alan Dershowitz..:

"Alan Dershowitz recently edited What Israel Means to Me, a collection of short pieces about Israel written by 80 prominent writers, performers, scholars, politicians, and journalists. "

----

What next? I showed you how each source you provided to counter HRW is actually a very biased source. If i wanted to bring arab/muslim sources, I can bring hundreds but i choose not to, because they are a side of the conflict and therefor they would be biased. However, you bringing israeli/jewish sources is just as bad as me bringing arab/muslim sources.

And just to keep you busy, I got you an article on haaretz that talks about an IDF commander admitting to war crimes. It is posted on a new thread.

What more do you want?
 
 
 http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/761781.html 

Thats the haaretz article, read it if you want.

And if you are a sensible person, you would recognize HRW and Amnesty as unbiased observers who have posted reports on palestenian as well as israelis. I dont understand how such an organization would be biased. Anyways, to save argument, i got you an IDF source. How are you going to counter that?

After you attempt to counter the IDF's claims of war crimes, I would like you to make your stance clear on the Geneva convention.

In effect, you are saying in what you posted, that it is ok to violate the geneva convention because it is 'outdated'. Correct? Is that how you justify israel's violations of human rights?

You challenged NONE of the information provided in a VARIETY of articles.

Can't you see that it is a fact that any criticism of HRW/Amnesty in relation to Israel will inevitably come from sources who care about Israel's reputation etc.? Someone who doesn't care wouldn't write such an article. Or will you just discredit the sources because those who don't care about Israel don't make the same points.

Come on, the list of the biases of Amnesty and HRW is tremendously long - you've dealt with not a single one of the points raised.

I want you to deal with the information, not a smear job on every possible source, just because it might be written by a Jew.

I don't believe the Geneva Conventions apply to the territories. They don't fit the description. Basically, the Geneva Conventions make clear that in the case of "occupied territories" they must have been captured from the legitimate control of one of the High Contracting Parties of the GCs. The West Bank and Gaza do not match that definition unless you recognise the Jordanian/Egyptian control was legitimate - which almost nobody did. And before you ask, the PA aren't a High Contracting Party.

Anyway, if you actually knew anything about the GC's, you'd know they are mainly focused on the laws of war - the legal status of enemy prisoners, those in captured territory etc. - not on Human Rights per se.

What exactly did you disagree with? I made two points on this thread, one telling Viva that petty insults add nothing to the debate; and the other was in regards of:

 
the Geneva Conventions date from over half a century ago - they have hardly any relevance to modern warfare and cannot even begin to relate to terrorism and other such issues. They are badly outmoded - the world needs an update.
 

.

which clearly shows you trying to legitmise torture. Then o said that torture should not be allowed; something you obviously disagreed with. Unless you disagree that torture should be legitimised then why get so pissed? And having to resort to childish neg-repping ?

And at least have the balls to leave your name when you neg-rep, coward.

No. I said that the GCs were out of date and SEPARATELY I argued that the treatment of terror-suspects does not constitute torture. Try to understand what you read, just sometimes. I don't believe "torture" takes place - so why would I "legitimise" it?

Once again, proof positive you have NO IDEA how the GC's operate and what they govern. I explained to you before how they are inapplicable to the territories.

The fact that I don't mention "torture" at all in the sentence you quote doesn't damage your claims of what it says, at all? In fact, I don't use either "torture", "legal" or "legitimise" - so for you to declare that sentence "clearly shows.. trying to legitimise torture" when I don't actually say anything about torture or legitimisation, is quite a stretch.

This clearly shows that you think GC should be "updated" for modern warfare, after viva talked about torture the Israelis had commited. And what are these "other issues"

 
Once again, proof positive you have NO IDEA how the GC's operate and what they govern. I explained to you before how they are inapplicable to the territories.
 

And it's not OK for Israelis to torture in their territories that fall under the GC but is it Ok to torture in occupied land? :wtf?:

You speak of " updating " the GC so torture can be OK to use against suspects etc etc. You never said those exact words but your intentions are clear.

 
Er, you KNEW it was me. And I knew you'd know it was me - so what would have been the point of signing it?
 

I only knew it was you after investigating and how did you know i would know it was you ? It could have come from any right-winger.

Have some self-respect and stop shrewdly trying to leave those neg-repped in the dark about who it was and why it happned. Othrwise there is no point.

If everyone agreed with your point there would be no debate, so stop (anon) neg-repping anyone who disgrees with you, coward.

They are out of date in that they don't contain provisions about how to deal with those who fight outside of uniform, for no State, have no part of the GCs and don't abide by the rules, i.e. terrorists. The GCs have plenty of stuff about captured soldiers, about civilians, but they simply DO NOT deal with terrorists. Which means no-one really knows what their status is and thus what can be done. That is why an update is needed - because things are not so clear-cut anymore, you no longer just get States fighting States.

Yes, I do, as I explain above.

1. I argued that what Israel does does not constitute torture SEPARATELY from my argument about the inapplicability of the GCs.
2. The GCs do not apply to the territories, therefore Israel can do things differently in terms of administration and the duty to the populace. It still cannot torture etc. as that would violate other treaties, but it does change the legal framework for other matters.

Ah, and here we have the truth - I never said those words, and your whole argument is predicated on what you THINK the intentions behind what I said is. Well, you've got it wrong.

I've always wondered what this problem people have with anonymous repping is - that's the way the system is set up, there is no obligation to sign rep and there is a way for a repped person to find out if they really want to know. I pay £35 a year in order, amongst other things, to see who it is that reps me. And you think that you have some right to have that information for free and that people are "cowards" for not giving it to you? It's not cowardly - you could find out exactly who has repped you, at any time, retrospectively, if you were that keen to know. It'll cost you £3.50. Cowardly would be to not neg rep at all for fear of reprisals.

By the way, I've had 101 neg reps, wanna know how many have been signed? 5. Not signing rep is hardly a practice limited to me.

Also worth mentioning are the inhumane conditions by which those people are held under.

 

Erm, this thread title (yes, the one that you created   ) is about LEBANESE civilians that have "been kidnapped." Not Palestinian. Therefore, it's a lie.

 
That is a matter of opinion. It cant be a 'lie' as it is purely opinion - please show some rationality.
 

No, it really isn't a matter of opinion. Hezbollah started the war, they kidnapped and killed soldiers FIRST. How many more times does this need to be repeated?

 
I never said that they threatened arab countries but they do have the weapons and you would only be fooling yourself if you think they dont.
 

You might not have, but your companion certainly did, hence the long tedious argument trying to get through to what seems like a brick wall.

 
Again, a matter of opinion which is also agreed on by many israelis. The evidence of this fact is the war probe that is going to start very soon in israel because of the IDF's 'failures'
 

Yes, it's an opinion which is why you have no right in preaching it around the forum as if it's fact when it clearly isn't.

 
Opinion. Cant be a lie.

Oh please have a longer memory than 2 months. The conflict with hezbullah started 20 yeasr ago when israel started attacking lebanon and then occupied the south and took thousands of prisoners as political hostages.

Its my opinion therefor i have the right to preach it. You cant preach facts, you preach opinions. From dictionary.com:

3. to advocate or inculcate (religious or moral truth, right conduct, etc.) in speech or writing.

Clearly, you dont understand the meaning of preach. If you did, you wouldnt ask me to preach facts not opinions.

Please learn to train your memory into things that it doesn't want to hear. One of those things being that Israel withdrew from Lebanon 6 years ago. Hezbollah's attack came out of the blue - there hasn't been much since Israel's withdrawal. Therefore, they started it.

What ARE you talking about? Clearly you can't read English because nowhere in that translation does the word "opinion" exist, but to the contrary, "truth."

No. That is israeli propaganda.

Israel still occupies the shebaa farms, which is lebanese according to 1923 maps which even the anti-syrian groups in lebanon accept. Syria also made it clear that they are lebanese.

Also, Israel still holds lebanese prisoners in its dungeons and it hasnt handed over the mine maps which costed lebanon lots of farmer lives in the past couple of years. Moreover, Israel still violated lebanese airspace on a regular basis after its 2000 humiliating retreat from the south. FURTHERMORE, Israel, on a number of occasions prior to the kidnapping of the soldiers, attacked lebanese farmers and on one occasion which is only a couple of months ago, killed a lebanese farmer on the lebanese side of the border.

Clearly, Israel is the one that started the war. Hezbullah's kidnapping of the soldiers was a mere response. ALSO, It is clear that israel's objective from the war wasn't to free the soldiers, because if it was, it wouldnt have stopped the war until they were freed. Now, a couple of weeks after the ceasefire, the soldiers are still held by hezbullah and israel doesnt seem to care less. THEREFORE, It is clear that the sparking of the conflict wasnt caused by hezbullah's kidnappings. Please look into things in a deeper manner.

You were the one telling me WHAT rights i had and didnt have and I was simply making clear the meaning of a word which you seemed to not know. Im sure if you knew the meaning of preach you wouldnt have used it. Preach means convincing people about a certain opinion you hold. You cant preach people facts. Think.

If you have seen my response as offensive or an attempt to insult you, I apologize sincerely.
 
 
1923!?

According to 1923 maps, Israel shouldn't exist at all, and Russia should be Communist.

Nothign to do with Israel.

The issue at hand is whether Shebaa farms are lebanese or syrian. No one claims they are israeli.
 
 
Not to mention the fact that the UN (hardly a bastion of "Israeli propaganda") designated the Shebaa Farms as Syrian. And the fact that Syrian refuses to legally hand them over to Lebanon. In fact, the only people who seem to think the Shebaa Farms are Lebanese are those looking for an excuse to be pissed with Israel. The status of the Shebaa Farms is pursuant to negotiations and a final treaty between Israel and Syria.

The Shebaa farms region has nothing to do with Lebanon. It is an occupied Syrian territory.
 
 
According the 1923 maps, it is lebanese. Syria says its lebanese and lebanese say its lebanese. I dont understand how you claim it to be syrian.

My point is that 1923 data is so out-of-date as to be useless. But I'll await the League of Nations' opinion on the matter.

Whilst the village of Shebaa is Lebanese the Shebaa farms region has been Syrian ever since there has been any kind of fixed boundary between Lebanon and Syria. Even now the exact location of the border is disputed. This has nothing to do with Israel, I’m sure that were the land released by Syria to Lebanon and were it taken control of by the Lebanese government rather than Hezbollah then Israel would withdraw.
 
 
My bad, actually, 1923 maps say they are syrian, according to the french mandate..

However, a syrian/lebanese commitee in 1960's agreed that they were lebanese.
 
 
HOWEVER, all this history doesnt matter.

The facts are:

Syria says theyre lebanese
Lebanon says they're lebanese

I therefor wouldnt understand why anyone would claim theyre not.

*******s, the first time Lebanon stated its claim to the Shebaa farms region was 2000
 
 
You always have to make me own you dont you??

From  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebaa_Farms 

"Border disputes arose at times, however. Shebaa Farms was not unique; several other border villages had similar discrepancies of borders versus land ownership. Syria and Lebanon formed a joint Syrian-Lebanese border committee in the late 1950s to determine a proper border between the two nations.

That's odd I was looking at that exact same page and this particular paragraph caught my eye.

"In 2000, in what appears to be the Lebanese government's first claim to the territory, Lebanon disputed Israel's compliance with UN Resolution 425 (1978). Lebanon claimed that the Shebaa Farms area was actually Lebanese, and demanded that the Israelis should therefore withdraw from there as well. Lebanon asserted that the UN certification of the Israeli withdrawal was "invalid," because of Lebanon's claim to the Farms.[15]"
 
 
Yes, the first time the lebanese GOVERNMENT.

However, its not the first time lebanon claims they were lebanese.. the lebanese/syrian commitee concluded that they were lebanese a long time ago.
 
 
I dont see the point of this argument about when or where it was decided it was lebanese

What matters as i said is that both sides have recently accepted that they are lebanese and therefor it is reasonable to assume they are.

You know that post has just given me an Idea. I'm going to get in contact with a couple of Canadian friends and form a committee to decide that Wales is actually a province of Canada.  
 
 
Dont be silly..

It was comitee established by both sides' governments

Why are you arguing for no reason? who gives a rats a$$ when lebanon said they were lebanese?

1. Territory cannot legally change hands just by one State going "it's yours" and another going "thanks".
2. Syria, despite supporting the Lebanese claim, has never signed anything official giving Lebanon the land, and indeed has refused to officialise any Lebanese claim over the land.
3. The UN certified in 2000 that Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon was complete. That was after a committee decided that based on the evidence available, the Shebaa Farms were Syrian.

Actually the 1923 agreement definitively puts it in Syria. As do the various maps of the area created by the Mandate authorities throughout the 20s, 30s and 40s. So does the armistice between Syria and Israel from 1949.

And Syria technically doesn't recognise Lebanon so how they can actually claim it to be Lebanese territory, I don't know.

Edit: and I ought to read ahead on a thread more often.

Yes, you are right and I have corrected my statement previously in the thread..
 
 
If Shebaa famrs are Syrian, then it concerns Lebanon that it becomes Syrian again... because Syrians are not cold-blooded murderers like Israeli Zionists, and Syria is at alliance with Lebanon. If you want "Lebanon to mind their own business" then let "U.S. mind their own business" first.

U.N. Force Is Treading Lightly on Lebanese Soil
By MICHAEL SLACKMAN

TIBNIN, Lebanon, Sept. 24 — One month after a United Nations Security Council resolution ended a 34-day war between Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah militia, members of the international force sent to help keep the peace say their mission is defined more by what they cannot do than by what they can.

They say they cannot set up checkpoints, search cars, homes or businesses or detain suspects. If they see a truck transporting missiles, for example, they say they can not stop it. They cannot do any of this, they say, because under their interpretation of the Security Council resolution that deployed them, they must first be authorized to take such action by the Lebanese Army.

The job of the United Nations force, and commanders in the field repeat this like a mantra, is to respect Lebanese sovereignty by supporting the Lebanese Army. They will only do what the Lebanese authorities ask.

The Security Council resolution, known as 1701, was seen at the time as the best way to halt the war, partly by giving Israel assurances that Lebanon’s southern border would be policed by a robust international force to prevent Hezbollah militants from attacking. When the resolution was approved, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, one of its principal architects, said the force’s deployment would help “protect the Lebanese people and prevent armed groups such as Hezbollah from destabilizing the area.”

But the resolution’s diplomatic language skirted a fundamental question: what kind of policing power would be given to the international force? The resolution leaves open the possibility that the Lebanese Army would grant such policing power, but the force’s commanders say that so far, at least, that has not happened.

“There’s a lot of misunderstanding what we are doing here,” said Lt. Col. Stefano Cappellaro, an Italian commander with the San Marco Regiment.

The force, known as the United Nation’s Interim Force in Lebanon, or Unifil, now has 5,000 troops on the ground, including 1,000 from Italy, and is stepping gently as it tries to carve out a role in a country that is feeling its way through the postwar period. It is early in the United Nations mission, but officials say that their most difficult task, and one they are adamant about achieving, is not being drawn into any power struggles between the religious and political factions in Lebanon. “We will not get involved in any domestic or regional politics,’’ said Milos Strugar, senior adviser to the force.

The force is larger, stronger and better equipped than an earlier Unifil contingent, which has been positioned on the border with Israel for years. But at the moment, the Lebanese government and the United Nations have a similar agenda in trying to win the trust of the Lebanese people and not have the force become a tool of political factions looking to incite domestic conflict. The goal is to be viewed as a peacekeeping force, not an occupying force.

So while there may have been some expectation that the international force would disarm or restrain Hezbollah, or search for hidden weapons caches, the commanders on the ground say very clearly that those tasks are not their job for now. “We will advise, help and assist the Lebanese forces,” said Col. Rosario Walter Guerrisi, commander of the San Marco Regiment, referring to the Lebanese Army.

But the challenges facing their determined neutrality are significant and often beyond their control. In Syria, for example, President Bashar al-Assad was reported in the Lebanese news media to have told a visiting Lebanese delegation that the strengthened United Nations force, with its heavy European contingent, resembled a force from NATO. In Lebanon, the United Nations force found its credibility questioned when German officials said, for example, that their country would contribute to the naval patrols off the coast of Lebanon as a means to protect Israel.

Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, has also questioned the purpose of the expanded force.

“Thus far, I have not heard any country participating in the Unifil say that it sent its sons and soldiers to defend Lebanon and the Lebanese,” he said in a speech Friday before hundreds of thousands of his supporters. “They are ashamed of us, brothers and sisters. They are ashamed of saying they came to defend us, but they talk about defending Israel.”

Hezbollah has so far acted in accordance with the cease-fire terms of 1701, which prohibits the deployment of weapons south of the Litani River, close to the Israeli border.

When the United Nations Security Council passed 1701, which set up the cease-fire, it outlined basic principles with few specifics. One of those principles was that militias were to be disarmed in compliance with earlier agreements and resolutions. It did not say, though, that the United Nations force would carry that out.

Hezbollah, the only militia that did not lay down its weapons after the Lebanese civil war ended, has made it clear that it is not going to surrender those weapons now. And Sheik Nasrallah made it clear that the international forces had better not even think about trying.

In Israel, skepticism about the effectiveness of the enlarged United Nations force has always been high, particularly in enforcing an arms embargo on Hezbollah. Israeli military officials have said that if they find evidence that trucks from Syria are resupplying rockets and launchers to Hezbollah, Israel will be justified in bombing those trucks.

The United Nations officials here say their primary duty, and the one that carries the most long-term benefits for both sides, is to help strengthen the Lebanese Army. At the moment, officials say the first priority is to make sure that all of the Israeli Defense Forces withdraw from land occupied during the war. United Nations officials said the process should be completed by the end of the month. The process involves weekly meetings along the border to set up a schedule that allows Israel to withdraw and the United Nations forces to move in, followed by the Lebanese forces. So far 85 percent of Israel’s forces have withdrawn, the United Nations said.

The formula for ending the war was also contingent on the state’s asserting its authority in the south, primarily by dispatching 15,000 Lebanese troops to the area. The resolution called for the Lebanese Army to be supplemented by a maximum of 15,000 foreign troops. Officials say that the ultimate size of the foreign force will be determined based on need — and one United Nations adviser said that meant it was unlikely the number of troops would ever exceed 10,000.

But however large the force, its officers said it would never be large enough if the population began to view it as an occupying force. The United Nations first set up an international force here in 1976, and so the people of the region are accustomed to seeing foreign troops in the blue berets of the United Nations.

But the new troops have stepped into Lebanon at a particularly tense time, as Hezbollah and the American-supported government are jockeying for position and power. If the Lebanese government did decide to expand the responsibilities of the troops now, they would risk turning them into targets of attack. These forces are much better equipped than past forces, and that has people a bit nervous about their mission.

“If these troops are going to clash with the resistance, they are going to clash with the people,” said Abu Rowda Noureddin, 64, as he collected free blankets and food supplies from the Red Crescent Society. He lives in the village of Burj Qalawiyah, a community of just 1,000 year-round residents in southern Lebanon that took heavy fire from Israeli jets.

The village is about 70 miles from Beirut and a short drive from a base staffed by Italian forces. Like most residents of neighboring villages, the people were essentially ignored by their government for many years. There is one school, no high school and few jobs. Villagers said that five times since 1972 the Israeli military had invaded their village, and so even those who said they did not count themselves as Hezbollah members said they counted themselves as Hezbollah supporters.

“The people here will fight against anybody who tries with force to take Hezbollah’s weapons away,’’ said Ibrahim Noureddin, another villager.

Up the hill, past houses pocked by shrapnel, the mukhtar, a kind of village administrator, was busy taking an inventory of the damage to crops and olive and fruit trees. He said that the Italian forces recently gave his community $3,000 to buy aluminum and glass to repair the school, which was damaged in an Israeli raid. “It was a very nice gesture on the part of the Italians,” he said.

But like everyone else, he said that for the forces to remain welcome they must demonstrate they are there to protect the Lebanese from Israel — not to police the Lebanese on behalf of Israel.

Not far away, on a busy road heading toward Beirut, Colonel Cappellaro stood beside two armored personnel carriers and 11 of his soldiers as cars sped by. He said that they were conducting a “static point,” as opposed to a checkpoint. If they saw anything suspicious they would notify the Lebanese Army. But the Lebanese Army was a good way up the road. At this point, he said, it would be impossible for the two forces to actually staff a check point together.

“When you don’t know each other’s procedures, you can not overlap,” he said before climbing into his jeep and driving off.

UN: causing wars by its sheer incompetence for 61 years and running.
 
 
Yes, that's right. The UN causes wars.  

" The Human Security Report 2005, produced by the Human Security Centre at the University of British Columbia with support from several governments and foundations, documented a dramatic, but largely unknown, decline in the number of wars, genocides and human rights abuses over the past decade. Such statistics cite:

•a 40% drop in violent conflict
•an 80% drop in the most deadly conflicts
•an 80% drop in genocide and politicide

The Report, published by Oxford University Press, argued that the single most compelling explanation for these changes is found in the unprecedented upsurge of international activism, spearheaded by the UN, which took place in the wake of the Cold War. "

Hmm.

Further:

" The Report singles out several specific investments that have paid off:

A six-fold increase in the number of UN missions mounted to prevent wars, from 1990 to 2002
A four-fold increase in efforts to stop existing conflicts, from 1990 to 2002
A seven-fold increase in the number of ‘Friends of the Secretary-General’, ‘Contact Groups’ and other government-initiated mechanisms to support peacemaking and peacebuilding missions, from 1990 to 2003
An eleven-fold increase in the number of economic sanctions against regimes around the world, from 1989 to 2001
A four-fold increase in the number of UN peacekeeping operations, from 1987, to 1999 "

Hmm.

And finally:

" A 2005 RAND Corp study found the U.N. to be successful in two out of three peackeeping efforts. It also compared U.N. nation-building efforts to those of the U.S., and found that of eight U.N. cases, seven are at peace, wherease of eight U.S. cases, four are at peace, and four are not or not-yet-at peace. "

"Not-yet-at-peace". That's got to be a candidate for "Best Euphemism Ever".

(All extracts are from Wikipedia's entry on "United Nations")

"So far 85 percent of Israel’s forces have withdrawn, the United Nations said." That's totally unconnected to any UN activity, is it?

The ceasefire had nothing to do with the UN either?

Anyway. The article makes a great song and dance about the fact that the UNFIL has to get Lebanese Army approval for certain actions, doesn't it? And: "The resolution leaves open the possibility that the Lebanese Army would grant such policing power, but the force’s commanders say that so far, at least, that has not happened." Well, the Lebanese government knows that having this force in the country is in its interest, because so long as the UN is there Israel is unlikely to do anything. It is also in their interest for another reason - they (largely) want Hizbullah out just as much as everyone else does, because it is as a direct consequence of not being able to get rid of Hizbullah on their own that their country was attacked.

So all in all, I expect the approvals that have so far been lacking will soon start coming. Remember, it's early days. The force has only just arrived (the troops are probably still arriving in dribs and drabs), and one honestly doesn't go from landing on the beach in a dinghy to fully operational peacekeeping force mode overnight. We've got two military bureaucracies to reckon with here - and this will remain the case even when initial hiccups are sorted out, so the gaining of the magic "green light" from the Lebanese Army may not be the smoothest process in the world.

You could say exactly the same of virtually every peace settlement ever. The resentment between the warring parties still remains.

The most obvious example is the Treaty of Versailles, but the same could probably be applied to the establishment of the DMZ in Korea and many other situations besides.

Who says the war is over? The fighting may have stopped but heck, ask any Israeli or Lebanese citizen - the war is still going on in their minds.

In retrospect, Israel wants to destroy Hezbollah. Hezbollah want to destroy Israel. Until one side has succeeded the war is never going to be over unless one side is miracuously appeased (most likely to be the Israeli side). Israel won't tolerate what they see as terrorism and Hezbollah are quite pervicacious, to say the least.

Additionally, back to the UN; they've been based in Southern Lebanon for quite a while now, if I'm not mistaken, before the recent Israel-Lebanon war. Why, then, have they allowed Hezbollah to transfer weapons from their Arab allies for 6 years right under their damn noses? To me, that exemplifies why the UN have proved totally and utterly useless. I wouldn't go as far as to say they've started any wars but they've definitely not prevented or stopped any wars, completely.
 
 
"In their minds"? That's not the same thing. The Cold War went on in the minds of billions.

Have Israel's own efforts "completely" stopped any wars?
 
 
Israel recently "confiscated" $1m from Palestian banks because it was "apparently funding terrorism". In 2004 Israel "confiscated" $9m from Palestinian banks for the same reason.

That's small potatoes compared to the funding the EU cut off from the PA when Hamas were elected.

Crikey. I don't see the point in getting started on semantics now but what my point was suggesting is that there's great tension between the two nations and only one side has to act out of place and the whole thing will start again.

Is it Israel's job to act as a peacekeeping force? I think not.

No, I know. I'm just saying that there's nothing unusual about that state of affairs - it's what one would expect after a war, and the more so in a region with a history of conflict.

Of course it's causing wars. The only reason the current Lebanon conflict ended was because the UN promised to help disarm Hezbollah. Now the UN is saying that it has no intention of doing so. It's a near certainty that this will lead to another war in the next few years.

Pure nonsense. The international activism wasn't spearheaded by the UN. It was spearheaded by the US and to a lesser extent UK. The UN didn't want to liberate Kuwait, until the US sent hundreds of thousands of troops there. The UN did nothing about Bosnia or Kosovo until NATO bombed the places. The UN did nothing about Haiti until the US promised to use force against the military junta there. The UN did nothing about Rwanda. It's doing nothing about Darfur. The international activism was caused by the end of the Cold War and the willingness of the US to fight wars for humanitarian reasons; it had absolutely nothing to do with the UN. The UN didn't even authorize any of the humanitarian interventions.
 
 
first of all id like to congratulate all the free people for hezbullah's remarkable victory over the IDF terrorist forces, after the recent victory rally which nearly one million lebanese - 25% of the population - attended. Well, i guess that all of the western 'wet' dreams that the lebanese people are against hezulla are alll..just dreams with no connection to reality. The lebanese are united now with hezbullah whether you like it or not. The pro-western government is led by a fake majority and it has to resign sooner or later. If america wants democracy in the middle east, first thing they have to do is give hezbullah power in lebanon.

Now onto israel, i found an interesting article that israel TORTURED the civilians it kidnapped after the end of the conflict. Remember how all the zionists on the baord were downplaying the issue of kidnapping of civilians? and how they were just given a ride to israel, questioned and released? well tis all false:

 http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article....ticle_id=75706 

BEIRUT: The Khiam Rehabilitation Center for the Victims of Torture said Monday that Israel continues to abduct Lebanese citizens from Lebanese territories in a "clear violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention and UN Security Council Resolution 1701."

The center said in a statement that "the convention prohibits the taking of hostages who have no active role in the hostilities, including members of armed forces who have laid down their arms and those put out of action by sickness, wounds, detention or any other cause."

The statement said that 13 people have been detained, tortured and then released by Israeli soldiers since the cease-fire was put into effect on August 14.

It added the Israelis "used the strongest forms of psychological and physical torture against the detainees."

$10m is pretty useful to the poor Palestinians. It's irrelevent whether they stole 4pence or £400000m; it's still theft.

Irrelevent: that's a different issue (but Israel, Britain and the US spend far more on arms each year).

You missed my point, my point was that the amount of money is so insignificant in real terms that trying to apply nefarious Israeli motives to its seizing doesn't make sense. If they seized $1m on the grounds it was part of assets linked to terror, the probability is that they believe the assets are linked to terror. It wouldn't be worth their while to take such action over such a small amount of money for any other reason, such as, as you imply, simply to harm the palestinians. And freezing, or seizing, assests used for terrorism isn't theft.

That's hardly relevant to the plight of the Palestinians, now is it? So why do you condemn Israel stealing $1 million from the Palestinians, but don't condemn Hamas and the PA stealing a hundred times that? And that's not even mentioning the tens of millions that PA officials put into their own pockets every year.

according to Israel it was going to be used for terrorism.

Er, that was a smaller point, using parenthesis, that was directly related to the point you raised, not really her original point about Palestinians.

... And as I have now said TWICE, it doesn't make sense for Israel to lie about that. $1m makes little difference in reality and if Israel wanted to seize assets simply for the hell of it, it could seize far more than that. It makes no sense for Israel to seize such a small amount unless they have evidence it's linked to terrorism. Also, I love your reflexive response of it being a ridiculous notion that the money could be terror-linked. Considering how rife terror organisations are in the territories and how pervasive the influence of terror, the money to support it has to be SOMEWHERE. So it's hardly unthinkable for there to be millions of dollars of terror-linked money in banks etc. in the PA-areas, is it now?
