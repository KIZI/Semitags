Panic on the streets of London, panic on the streets of Birmingham.

Shoplifters of the World unite and take over.

The rain falls hard on a humdrum town.

This pretty much perfectly sums up the English summer of 2011.
It is clear that we are in the presence of Jesus himself.
 
 
Did I say I'd always liked Morrisey?
 
 
Shame he's also a dick.
 
 
 
Shame he's also a dick.

 

But did I ever tell you, by the way, I never did like your face!
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...
 
 
First of the gang to die...
 
 
Morrisey is a prophet?... That joke isn't funny anymore  
Morrisey can predict the future? What a miserable lie!

So stop me if you think you've heard this one before but I'm going to go sit by the cemetry gates because heaven knows I'm misrable now after reading your post. You seem to paint a vulgar picture of society.

I think I'm going nowhere fast with this and it's clear I started something I couldn't finish   But alas this night has opened my eyes  

Time to toddle off and listen to the Smiths me thinks because I know it's over and I have no idea what I'm jabbering on about now  
 
 
Those people would rather not go back to the old house, as I imagine it will have been looted, the people who have done it will be thinking Strangeways Here We Come.

These Sweet and Tender Hooligans should get what they really deserve, then again, You've Got Everything Now. Unfortunately with regard to the world these people think that I Don't Owe you Anything.

We all know why this has happened, Barbarianism begins at home and in terms of relative deprevation they want the one they can't have.

In any case i'm going as That Joke isn't Funny Anymore.
