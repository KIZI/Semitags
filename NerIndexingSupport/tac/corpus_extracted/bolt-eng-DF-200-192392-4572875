 
 
White party VS black party...
 
 
Been to four parties this year so far, two where mostly black people and the other two were white. And **** me the white people one was just a gathering ! The girls get dressed up in these skirts how an earth do they expect to whine/be daggered ??
 
 
Why the hell would I want to whine or be daggered? Just want to talk to some friends and drink a beer, jeesh.
 
 
whine?

Have you ever been daggered?

Whine/whining is basically horny dudes humping girls from behind to music. No idea what being daggered is, but it sounds scary. "Black" parties suck. I'd rather just drink and socialise with friends if I'm at a party.
 
 
In my experiences
Black people at a white party drink supermalt and jam in the corner. They never dance and just go around sayin "yeah I'd beat that still" and not manke any moves on the girls
At a black party they're all daggering etc
 
 
You're a misogynistic crude homogenous caveman so I wouldn't expect you to understand the enjoyment one gets from talking.

Last year's prom, most of the black people were doing that in the middle of the hall, in front of the teachers...

I found it very awkward.

I wouldn't want to?  

I guess it's a culture thing, if someone did that on a dancefloor in my city they'd be laughed at.
 
 
im black........but I still prefer gatherings and talking to groups of people with a beer in hand

but daggering a girl would be quite good

Nah. I think it's ridiculous.

But apparently it's happened in the city I live in! (I can't find the video right now   )
 
 
That's daggering?

  White boys aint got no rythm...Although white parties do have white girls so i have a bit of a dilemma.
 
 
Ahh those carribs  

All the west african black parties I've been to involve this kind of music

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Lk8pUeLCwQ 

and a bucket of jollof rice with crates of supermalt.

Good times

Hahaha

Not sure if any resident african or nigerians can help me with this but there is this song where the guy says something like "Umaji" and then this beat plays and then the beat stops and the guys says "Umaji" again and then the beat starts again. Goes on for about five minutes but the song is ******* epic.

Anyways I've bin to a few white parties in my time, can either be great, or just completely crazy and absurd. For example - jam on the walls and biscuit in hairs, white people go iinnnnnn. They make sure they enjoy themselves even if they aren't doing much.

Compared to black parties where everyone will stunt and look good. But then again, nothing beats good whine.
 
 
Just different cultures isn't it. One of the last 'mixed' parties I went to ended up with nearly all the black people in one room, standing around the walls frowning trying to look hard, with their chains outside their tops and making gun gestures to crap music and not much drinking, while most of the white people were out in the garden drinking and chatting to people.

Then again, I've been to parties with what I'd regard as "proper" black people, not the scum you get in London, and had loads of fun with great reggae/African music and fantastic food.

That's the difference. If you go out with black chavs you're going to get the run of the mill male genitalia heads trying to act hard wearing bandannas and ed hardy jeans down to their ankles.

To be fair a lot of them are hench as and could probably knock my head off from hear to Accra in one shoryuken.

Not at all, just that a LOT of black people in London do the stereotypes no favours. The older generation are really nice usually, but among younger ones it sadly seems that nice, friendly people are in the minority.

I spent 17 years in south London and a majority of the black kids fell into that description. In fact, any of the black kids in my school who didn't get into fights, didn't get suspended, didn't act threatening etc were ridiculed by the other black kids for "trying to be white"

I feel for you brother. This 'trying to be white' bull **** makes me want to pimp slap a mongoose.
 
 
Africans always seemed a lot friendlier than West Indians, a lot less aggressive and violent etc. Just a shame that they always got abused by other blacks for being "fresh off the boat" (which funnily enough is ****ing BNP talk) and the West Indian culture took over to the extend even white kids these days think they're Jamaican.

OK just checking. But South London is a lot worse than everywhere else. As far as I'm concerned, it's not even part of London. But yeah, it is quite depressing at time.
 
 
I tend to find black + white parties are the best a lil bit of everything best of both
 
 
Party???? as in a house party????

thats just epic lame.....if you can't find a way to drink outside underage then you don't deserve to be drinking at all

and if you arent underage, and can therefore drink in clubs/pubs, then you are epic, epic fail for having house parties....i mean really..

Can't see the point of daggering, rather just ****.

I think you mean alhaji. Is the song in the background of the youtube video the one you're talking about? (You have to go about minute for the beat i think you're talking about to kick in)

Ur doing it wrong son. I'm 21 and house parties are by far the best fun. Going to some bar full of nobs, paying rip off prices, dealing with dickhead bouncers, closing times, hit n miss music vs House party with good friends, all ur own tunes, cheap drink of ur choice, do whatever drugs you want, act how you want etc

Then again, our house parties generally involved 2 amps, strobe lights, several crates of beer and went from about 8pm to 9am.

Pub/Club:
Full of ***** and ***** girls
Expensive drinks
Terrible music
Doormen/security
Last call/place closes

House party:
Full of friends/decent people
Cheap booze
Whatever music you want
No one in charge
Can party until sun-up

Dancing is for women anyway.

Mind you I'm just jealous I can't dry hump a woman while making gun gestures
 
 
Well I must admit that I enjoy a good white party but I love black parties.
They both have there ups and downs.
I hate it when a white party is about drinking and nothing else and when a black party is all about the daggerin'.
Black parties have great music variety and great food.
white parties give you the chance to socialise more.

Not too sure about that. You could say 'great music', if you like the genres, but definitely not better variety.

Far more likely to get a white person putting on some decent hiphop, or even reggae (even if its common stuff like Marley or UB40 or summat) or whatever than you are to get a black person putting on some rock or indie.

I know a lot of black people who love their music, but it tends to be only a select few genres (reggae, soul, what would be fair to call 'black music'), whereas the more varied listeners tend to be white.

I don't know what type of people you've been hanging around. The Africans I know are way more aggressive than Caribbean people.
You must have come across quite a few Jamaicans (who are usually more aggressive than other islanders.
Oh and the "freshy" thing s just black people banter. For some reason black Africans and Caribbean people love to banter about origin. It's not right, but that's the way it is.

Also, I hate daggerin'. I find it disgusting and it's a Yardie Jamaican thing.

Which part of London have you encountered these black people you speak of?

I find most of that culture disgusting tbh. Which is why it's a shame that it seems to be seen as the 'cool' one, or at least the one so many kids try and emulate.

 
Which part of London have you encountered these black people you speak of?
 

South West, usually through other people. I know a few black people, one is a good friend, but he speaks normally and is really intelligent (surprise surprise, one of the people who got accused of 'acting white', even though he probably knows more about his culture than most).
 
 
That's because we're not chavs.

Well i go to plenty of black parties where there has been, reggae, afro-beats, house, funky house, 'pop', bashment, soca, hip-hop, r'n'b, indie etc... all at the same party. Even if at some the music is 'black' music there is still variety.

Not in Ireland they're not. But besides, can't be cheaper than buying from a supermarket. Even in England I miss the house parties we'd have when we were 17. There is nothing a bar offers that house party doesn't (maybe a good DJ but that'd be your fault for listening to crap music), but there's far more freedom and fun to be had at a house party.

You do realise that a lot of people would group most of those into maybe 3 main genres right? I can break down 'dance' into several sub genres, doesn't make it varied.

Besides, anyone who listens to RnB (unless it's the old, proper RnB) and isn't a 14 year old girl should be shot.

Nah, sorry...not with you on this. I started pubbing/clubbing as soon as I could get served and have never looked back. I do not frown upon pre-drinking of course....

get some perspective jheez
 
 
I've been drinking in pubs since I was about 15. Most proper pubs are gone these days, mainly replaced with yuppie wine bars full of skinny jeans funboys. I still love going to the pub, but for a party you can't beat your own gaff (well, a friends preferably...)
 
 
London is a hole in general though. Great to visit, so long as you don't have to talk to any of the natives (which is easy enough since they either can't speak English or won't talk to you anyway!).
 
 
White people aren't pumped on fried chicken so they're too tired to dance

You should go to Jamaica and meet some real Jamaicans and I'm sure you'd like the culture very much. Not every Jamaican is a Yardie.

South West, usually through other people. I know a few black people, one is a good friend, but he speaks normally and is really intelligent (surprise surprise, one of the people who got accused of 'acting white', even though he probably knows more about his culture than most).

 

I think you should spend sometime in London and make up your mind for yourself about the black people there. Go to the different areas of London too. You'll find that the people in south are a lot different from the people in East/North/West London. Don't paint everyone with the same brush.

Are your black friends African by any chance?

I know that there are different types of black people and I'm not one of those ignorant people who accuse people of 'acting white'.

Yes I do realise, i listen to house. Not every black person listens to hip-hop and bashment all day.

You should explore all genres with and open mind. I love most genres barr heavy metal. I can't stand that crap....

Well I wouldn't be making such statement if I'd never been to South London. Oh wow, it's got Greenwich Park. It's one big ********.

OK I'm exaggerating a little. There are are quite few lovely places in South London, especially along the Thames. But I think South London on a whole isn't a pleasant place compared to the rest of the city. I'm not saying the rest is perfect. It's far from that.

Good job on having your insurance choice the same grades as your firm choice. That's genius.

The idea is to have the insurance at lower requirement than your firm so that if you fail to meet the requirements, you're covered by the insurance. Did you know that?

Yes... I did know that.

 

But it turns out that I don't have a lower offer elsewhere and the place I had an AAB offer for isn't exactly great in my course so I went for uni's which were and I liked Manchester and I was never going to get AAB anyway.

 

Maybe you need to get some sleep. It's quite early.

You're right. It's early and I should sleep. Or maybe I just woke up.

I like how we share our wisdom. It's a shame you didn't come to me when you were applying to university. I could have taught you what the word insurance meant, and you could have made sure I got a good night's rest during the hectic Christmas period.

You're not applying your logic in the right manner. Many factors were involved in me making my choices. What would have been the point in firming an AAB offer, if as you suggest I'd never get BBB?

Don't get so upset. I'm just pointing out where you went wrong. A wise person learns from their mistakes.
 
 
These YouTube clips are scaring me...
 
 
I've grown up in the Caribbean so I wine. I also like to chat, chill and drink... Over here no matter what race predominates the party (white, black, indian etc) there's bound to be wining... I like it, but I don't obsess over it... Don't know how to dance without doing it now..

As for tap, did you do ISTD examinations?

Far more likely to get a white person putting on some decent hiphop, or even reggae (even if its common stuff like Marley or UB40 or summat) or whatever than you are to get a black person putting on some rock or indie.

I know a lot of black people who love their music, but it tends to be only a select few genres (reggae, soul, what would be fair to call 'black music'), whereas the more varied listeners tend to be white.

 

You have a good point but you might be interested to hear that my mates and I appreciate a wide array of music including indie, punk,, metal, rock, death metal, gothic metal, dance and others... We're not all the same you know.

Goes on for about five minutes but the song is ******* epic.

 

haha i know that song...its called ALHAJI by DJ Ramatoulaye

No, just no. In general most white people dance awfully. Yes there are a few black people who cannot dance but white people and asians totally outdo us in the bad dancing numbers game. Sometimes it just completely puts me off, its like they're dancing to the words and not the beat.
 
 
Lmao @ the two extremes....

I like a bit of both tbh.

I pray for the person who dares try to dagger me.
 
 
Haha a lot of white kid parties i've seen the girls get dressed up like they are goin out. It's just a house party ladies calm down!

It's probably down to a lack of interest really. Nearly all (white) people I know think dancing is a bit gay, definitely a female pursuit anyway, and whenever I see black people dancing I tend to split my hole laughing. Like whenever I get the bus there seems to be black girls standing there practising some sort of routine and I'm just like.... lol

I agree, love just bein able to kick about in trackies and **** at a house party, but it's not as if that's a white thing, not when so many black people are so intensely materialistic they feel the need to dress in clothes more expensive than they can afford, wear big gaudy chains outside their clothes etc
 
 
Why were you invited to the white party?

Why would Asians bother going to a chicken shop, for?  

Indians do it because they think they're Black, Whites do it because they think they're both Black AND Indian, whereas Asians and Hispanics and Blacks themselves just get on with it...

...and so goes the schoolhouse argument, errggh...

I had to put a stop to that idea before it got OUTTA HAND!  

She probably meant `roasted`.  

(Oddly enough, I'd be surprised if she hadn't roasted in a whole other way, considering her attitude to the Black way of doing things...   )

i thought you grew up in south london? Your comments have gone from slightly inaccurate to just ignorant and offensive

Oh and I grew up in south london too, was into my books and rather articulate, its nothing to do with "acting white", you and your friends were probably pussies

Did you go to my school? That was my experience  . But not all black people (or even most) are like this. There are some idiots that act like this and unfortunately the reputation sticks. It was a lot to do with image and fitting in when I was at school. Hasn't been as much of an issue at uni because I left London.

As an aside, I want some jollof rice now. And some fritters. Why not mix it up a bit? All this caribbean/african hate is boring.

Lastly, I love south london. Don't jealous me.

Ofcourse.. That's because if they're FAT they'd look bad doing it.

LMAO @ This thread though. I needed a laugh this afternoon  

I've been to both parties including Black/white clubs. I really do not have a preference. I have to admit I have some plus sides n negative sides to both.
it's a shame so many people on here have a sterotypical view of what black parties n white parties include without going out n experiencing it yourself.

Like all parties some will be cr*p and some will be sick.

Positive
Black Parties - Music is usually all to do with getting on the floor n dancing.
Most of the girls know how to dance and I dont just mean "whine"
White Parties - They arent afraid to have a drink n a talk etc.
Most of them dress smartly/casually with a shirt n skinny ties etc.
No afraid to let loose and be silly if need be.

Negatives
Black Parties - They're self concious, in a sense they dont wanna make a fool of themselves. Specially the guys. They stand in the corner n watch.
White Parties - They drink waaaay too much in ma opinion. and find that if they dont drink you are an outcast. They seem to need it to bosst confidence  

But hey, there are bad and good things in all. Oh and yes being black and me liking white parties has seen black people say "why you tryna be white for" etc. It goes with the territory. But with my mouth and my focus on what I want, when I want... No one can tell me sh*t and I don't care either way.

from the girls I've seen (nigerian/ghanian/other black girls)... they tend to have larger arses, not in proportion to their body and when they do this "bashment" type dance (or whatever you call it) it doesn't appeal to me (seeing all that jelly shake around)... however my black brothas are loving it!

So there's nothing sexual about rubbing your cock over a girl's arse?
 
 
Also what's up with white girls that SWAY, making you look like you can't dance kmt ! not saying no white girls can dance though

For someone proclaiming themselves to be "rather articulate" and into books, you'd do well to improve your comprehension and understanding. I never said these people were "acting white", in fact I've been openly scornful to that attitude in this thread. It was other black people who said it to the ones who chose to behave like normal, civil people.

Yeah man, that sounds about right... Maybe not on the meth front like, that **** is nasty.

Like this man, a good nighout for white people (for the record, I'm white) is gettin off their face on anything consumable and making a fool of themselves. Then take pictures of the events and post them on facebook, it's how it is!

Wouldn't know how "black" parties go down, never been to one!

By 'proper' black people I meant decent people who love their rich culture and history, lots of nice traditional food, proper caribbean or african music etc. Rather than the newer generation of tossers in inner-cities who have created a whole new violent, embarrassing culture.
 
 
I actually don't like white parties much, people just get really drunk and act stupid. At black parties you can socialise and talk, or you can dance. But I dont get daggered because thats just a bit too much for me.

Agree with you there.
I heard there is, because canada has not really been affected by the recession, and a lot of companies considering to relocate there so loads of opportunities.
 
 
The problem for me is the dancing. I am absolutely **** at it. Since I don't know them. I can't even practice.

TBH you just sound like the typical ignorant jackass who expects all blacks to conform to his jaded opinion of the race unless proven otherwise. The nonsensical youth subculture is popularized by many different races, one only needs to walk down the streets of east and north london to see that. I cant stand closet pricks like you, especially when you ***** make statements like "you're well behaved for a black person" lol. Go **** yourself, probably got chased out of london for being a total weasel.

hahaha, no tescos. I suppose they have alternatives, and there is always youtube. CBC tends to show UK shows anyway, so you won't miss out on Coronation Street.

No sir, you fail to understand what I've said. I condemned anyone who feels the need to segregate someone because they don't conform to a stereotype, as I said, it was the other black people in my school who used to do this.
 
 
I went to a black party last year, it was amazing. MJ tunes all night.  

WHINE IT, WHINE IT.
 
 
Black parties are more fun in terms of dancing whereas white parties are more about talking and drinking.

My best friend is Jamaican/Grenadian and the parties are always so damn good. What I like about black parties is that you get awesome food and good rum. White parties serve you *****/nothing at all but you get less attention from the back which is good! Sometimes I want to go out and not have a guy wrapped around me. I do love to whine though!

Nothing wrong with either tbh, depends what you are in to.

true, but they said their not gonna spend massive amounts like city, gonna clear the debt, start the new stadium and and initially strengthen the squad which we only need a few players, then the long term is to be self-sufficient, not in the mould of city or real throwin' silly money about. Real are all about galacticos anyway, city are just pretenders, no way they can keep everyone happy, we just need a few, the spine is there.
 
 
There are good white parties and good black parties. There are also good mixed race parties. Lastly, there are also bad parties of all these catagories. In a debate in white parties vs black parties, there are too many intangibles to properly calculate which is the best, and anyway, race seriously doesnt correlate to the quality of a party.

Lol wtf. You get parties which are majority white or black. But a majority mixed race party? Or do you mean a party with a mix of difference races?

im real optimistic especially without rafa's negative tactics, hopefully we can let the shakles off and play, but we'll just have to wait and see.
 
 
what's whining and daggering?
 
 
As a Black British guy with Jamaican grandparents. I have to hold my head in embarrassment and sigh while reading this thread. As if all people of black skin have one type of party and those of white skin do as well. Getting really sick and tired of black/white or black v white or any other combination threads. I can't be bothered to even go into detail and explain why any more. Another one will pop up in three days loaded with another set of stereotypical assumptions. People will just continue to make wild and on the boarder edge racist remarks and assertions. Nothing will change.

**** sake.

Roy Hodgson has big boots to fill since Rafa has left to be honest. Let's Hope he is half decent as Rafa.
 
 
Tbh both are really, really ****.

WHITE PARTY
-Over-made up girls rarely seen WITHOUT a bottle of wine in their hands
-Guys with 0 game trying to score, but proving themselves as socially awkward penguins
-Usually really bad music. It verges from new-age rock music or RnB which I expect to hear in shopping malls.
-They have this really wierd thing where they are compelled to mosh, even at a song that dosent require it.
-Lame dancing, forcing yourself into either conversing with a drunk person, or praying that Iran drops a nuke soon.

CONVERSELY

BLACK PARTY

-If you cant grind, dagger, bootyshake etc, you will hate it.
-No worthy conversation at all, usually just shouting all the time whenever the track switches to lil wayne or Kanye West
-Black girls will tend to only jam with black guys, or asians who beg to be black and look like pricks in the process.
-For some reason, every time i go to a black party, there is TONS of jaloff and supermalt o_0

anyway even at a black party, after a few hours you wish iran dropped a nuke.

true say, but im hopin he can the best out of some players which rafa couldnt cause roys more of a man manager, but if he gets serious money to spend, his job gonna be a lot harder with all eyes on him.

You guys are the second hottest topic of this forum, barring muslims.

that said

So...

1. Black people don't like drinking compare to white people
2. Black people prefer not to talk as much compare to white people
3. Black people always can hold a great party compare to white people
4. Black people are irrational sexual predators
5. Black people are programmed to whine and dance

Amazing. Well thank you for telling me what my entire family, who happen to be Black British/Jamaican act like. Yes this indeed so true.

Talking? no no my family would rather not talk and get up to dance in a party. Of course all my male family and friends are molestering after the women too. Definitely...

For crying out loud. I give up.

Hmmm, most of the 'black' parties I have been to haven't involved much drinking, but a lot of dancing to African music and British music (NO DAGGERING WHATSOEVER, that stuff's nasty   ) and delicious traditional food piled high. Om nom nom nom.
Of the 'white' parties I have been to though, half of the people are so drunk/stoned/on other drugs that they barely know which way is up, throwing up all over the place, talking *****, having sex with random people in garden bushes/parent's rooms/railings etc, whereas the other half are relatively normal, chatting, dancing, eating nibbles such as crisps an chipolatas and mini eclaires.....

For the food reason alone, black parties win. Give me some muy muy with a side of jollof rice and puff puff, above Walker's salt and vinegar with mild salsa dip any day of the week

Hmm prefer the music @ "White" parties (i love all kinds of music but when it comes 2 a partaay i LOVE Dance Music plus i feel that GENERALLY at White parties you get more of a variety of music whereas at "Black" parties it tends to be just Urban.) I also prefer that @ White parties people tend to let their hair down more. On the other hand i always seem to do something i regret @ White parties (alcohol etc.) Partys a party though at the end of the day...

770 million in debt..

Glazers have US ventures which are in debt.

So altogether £1.5 billion

There are people willing to pay that much to be honest.

Oh wow, struck a chord. Sorry.

You take what you want from what I wrote. I didn't mean to offend but I admit I did generalise heavily.

'Black parties' = great food/drinking/dancing/smoking/whining & grinding/parties start later

'White parties' = drinking/dancing/smoking/parties start early Also taking drugs & monging out on Ket/Pills etc

I can only form an opinion from what I have experienced tbh but obviously all parties are different. The main difference in my eyes is the food and the general vibe of the party. I've always found white parties quieter and more boring or with trance music and people coked/pilled/ket up....people sitting around or dancing to ABBA etc. Black parties usually have older people eating/talking in one room and then later dancing in another. The young people stick to the dancing/grinding. Just the way I've seen it.

So i guess i've got that to "look forward" to when i start Uni then lol  . Or is it only Art Students who are crazy ?
 
 
White parties can be good. Except the music and food is usually dry. Black parties vastly outrank them in this respect. Except sometimes when the party is dominated by Jamos with their bashment and hardcore daggering and all the Africans (like myself   ) stand around the corners wondering what to do and waiting for the DJ to play Hip Hop again.

Oh and the "freshy" thing s just black people banter. For some reason black Africans and Caribbean people love to banter about origin. It's not right, but that's the way it is.

Also, I hate daggerin'. I find it disgusting and it's a Yardie Jamaican thing.

Which part of London have you encountered these black people you speak of?
 

 

No, just to correct you there. Caribbean NOT African people are the ones who go on about origin and its not what I call banter.

Only last week I had a chap on TSR called S.R or something along those lines tell me that just from looking at my facial features on my profile; he can tell I'm african and fresh off the boat and he was being serious lol. I think that type of talk is common amongst Caribbean people.

South West, usually through other people. I know a few black people, one is a good friend, but he speaks normally and is really intelligent (surprise surprise, one of the people who got accused of 'acting white', even though he probably knows more about his culture than most).

 

Yes, I agree with a lot of your observations but South West London but i wouldn't have imagined encountering such in south west london. It's more common in south east and east london.

Black people can throw a great party or 'Shoobz' as they call it round 'ere   with good music, good vibes, great food. But you get some White parties that involve a lot of dancing, drinking, drugs (if that's what you do) and getting off with girls either way.. both sound like great nights.

On the other hand (it's a very big hand)

You have black parties where there is a lot of unwanted arguments, fights, stabbings as i've experienced and a whole load of other stuff. And then you have some white parties (like one I went too on saturday night) where half the party is inside playing gay drinking games and listening to gay dubstep not even good dubstep and the other half are outside bunning and drinking.. Both sound pretty bad to me.
 
 
Never been to a "black party".

I dislike parties.
I hate the general majority of people.
At parties, there are people I don't know.
Alcohol is usually present at parties. This provides everyone I don't know with the means I act like idiots.

I would and do prefer drinking heavily with a couple of good mates for a weekend than being in a room with a load of people I don't know.
Oh, and the alcohol always runs out too early at parties as well. Usually just after the shops shut.
And you can't bring your own because someone will nick it if it's not superglued to your genitals.

Edit: The first statement and everything else beneath that are unrelated.

Lol dude. You're acting like alcohol is the only way !
 
 
Okay guys so there seems to be a lot of white chicks getting uptight in here. Firstly everyone in here has expressed an opinion, not one person has said that " Black parties rule "...which they do  . Kiddin :P

So chill out

Upbringing within that culture though, hence the trend.

I'm confused. I know slightly what you're talking about, however I'm talking about generally. And it could just be the black girls you met in ireland, although there's probably not that many.

Seriously though, you should try it some time.

   

Maybe tomorrow.

Hmm. It seems to me that people are only offended by generalisations if they're negative.

 

 

Maybe but not in my case. I just hate the idea of generalising an entire group of people based on a couple of experiences. What people tend to also do is allow those experiences to act as guidance on their opinions on everyone!. If I had got a penny for every time people commented on me not being 'black'. I would now be rich. Ignoring the fact that my grandparents are Caribbean immigrants and both my parents are Black British.

Black people can dance is a positive stereotype and I still hate it.

Only last week I had a chap on TSR called S.R or something along those lines tell me that just from looking at my facial features on my profile; he can tell I'm african and fresh off the boat and he was being serious lol. I think that type of talk is common amongst Caribbean people.

 

No need to correct me, I do actually know what I'm talking about...

It must obviously vary depending on who it is.
Where I'm from, amongst a group of close African and Caribbean friends there is harmless banter about origin; and it was the Africans who brought about the term 'freshy' when speaking about their family.

There are however, some times when it is not banter. I went to a school/college where the majority of the black people were African; and they would constantly say negative things about Caribbean people. I can even recall one person (who didn't realise I was in the room) call Caribbean people 'slaves'.
Alongside the banter, there were many occasions when the Africans would put down the Caribbean and all the people from it. I even know one person who said that his mum said he was not allowed to marry a person from the Caribbean because they're of "low class". This was something that was shared by a number of people from the Caribbean.
I didn't and don't understand why this is and I've even had White and Asian people say, "why are they acting like this? You're all black. What's the difference?".
It even got to the point where one day I had enough and schooled everybody about that same point that all the non-African/Caribbean people had made. We're all black! If someone who is not from Africa or the Caribbean sees us, they see a black face and not our heritage.
In the Caribbean people embrace their African roots! People go around in traditional African clothes (mainly on special occasions) and even children are taught of their African heritage.
Last week in the Caribbean (I'm not sure if it was all Islands but it was in Grenada) was the celebration of emancipation from slavery. Everywhere, people were wearing traditional African clothes. I went to the bank and there was a huge display about Africa and what goes on in Africa. Even today in Carnival, there was a whole mass dedicated to Africa.
This is why i don't get why some Africans feel so negatively towards people from the Caribbean. I've even said this to some of my African friends and they've even agreed that their parents/aunties/uncles etc... have passed down negative attitudes towards the Caribbean and people from there and they have no idea why.
Also, you can sometimes tell the difference between African and Caribbean people by looking at them but not always. (not justifying what that guy said btw)

I do admit that there are some ignorant Caribbean people out there (usually the ones who have no knowledge of black history). There are times when I've heard negative comments about Africans from Caribbean people. However, I'd say this is at the minority of times whereas i've heard anti-Caribbean comments by Africans, way more frequently.
I hope that clears everything up.
Sorry about the Essay. My bad. lol

LOL, to be honest I agree but Carribeans laugh at african names, even though someone along their trees has an african name.
To be honest i don't care about that stuff. We're all black and that's all that matters.
We need to stop killing each other, we are our own enemies.

That you! i agree with that!
Where's the unity man!

I will admit that some Caribbean people do laugh at African names but I will say that it's mostly done light-heartedly and not to look down on someone.

Like you said, there needs to be more unity! If a non-black sees a black person the see black and not African or Caribbean.
It's stupid really.

I must admit I'm awfully bad at generalising, but the group of friends I hung out with were split down the middle. Half the arty people were relaxed and went with the flow, but the other half were nuts about being wasted and annoying.

The art students at UCL I know take pride in their work, work hard but play very hard. The science students I knew were partied too but were more sensible.

Dunno everyone is different tbh but I found art students were very good at throwing parties...very imaginative!

Lol although you covered both sides, your essay on the whole is biased against African people. In my experience, I find that a lot of Caribbean people I have met do not really like Africans. I can honestly say I have never ever had an experience of an African person express negativity towards Caribbean people. The only thing I have heard African people say is that Caribbean people don't like us which is consistent with my experience.

So lets just agree to disagree because none of what you say rings true with my experience of black people (as in both African and Caribbean). Maybe I haven't hung around enough both African and Caribbean people to know the true picture but as it stands, I base my opinions on personal experience which are consistent with what that guy had originally posted as well.
 
 
Difference between black girls and white girls (this is a generalisation, so obviously doesn't apply to everyone)

Is that white girls have no self respect and black girls do!

(I'm white BTW)
 
 
is this daggering or whining?

Both whining and daggering, but the daggering is not as extreme like the video that was posted earlier on in the thread.

My account if not bias against Africans but it's what i've observed having grown up around many African and Caribbean people.

Caribbean people do like Africans and African culture it's just that you many come across some who are hostile towards Africans due to having bad experiences with Africans.

It's obvious that being around different people will bring about different situations. As we're both on different sides of the debate we're likely to have had different experiences.

What we should take away from this is that we're all black and both Africans and Caribbean people need to work together to resolve the problems in the black community.

eerrrmmmmm yea tad stereotypical

from personal xp parties with mainly (for me) blacks/indian(asians etc) have tended to be messier... having said this those parties with mainly whites can be messy too.

comes more down to who's hosting/where it's at/what time of year etc...

very little diff imo

There's always a difference. White people tend to not dance, usually jump around and call it dancing whilst drunk. Black people actually dance and have rhythm... !

What you said is true though, except for the time of year lol ( wtf ) ?

Fair enough, I can respect your decision. But please never go on the dance floor if you're going to tell guys you're not going to dance. It's not the fact you won't dance with the boy that annoys them, it's the principle of being boring and refusing lol

i get ur point but if someone just bends you over it's kind of hard to tell them to stop, it's not really disrespecting urself cos it's just dancing.

You tryna tell me that a girl has never let you whine on her but walked off when you try and dagga her?

 

A girl has never walked off or refused to let me dagga. They only refuse to let me whine, coz **** gets sexual and some girls just freak out....

Maybe its how I was brought up IDK.

 

Your right,sometimes they can force you which is surpising, which does prove that they have no respect

black parties are more fun. white parties tend to either just be a group of friends who allready all know eachother. or just a bunch of people taking loads of drugs and drink flailing their arms around to pendulum.
