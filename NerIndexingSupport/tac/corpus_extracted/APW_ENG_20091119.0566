Spain's conservative opposition has asked the country's intelligence chief to testify over whether ransom was paid for the release of a Spanish trawler hijacked by Somali pirates.

Popular Party spokeswoman Soraya Saenz de Santamaria says the director of the National Intelligence Center should testify behind closed doors at parliament.

The trawler Alakrana was released Tuesday after an alleged ransom payment of $3.3 million. Somali pirates held the ship and its 36-member crew for 47 days.

The Spanish government refuses to say if a ransom was paid.

Saenz de Santamaria spoke in a television interview Thursday. She was answering a question as to whether she thought the government or the ship's owner had made the alleged payment.
