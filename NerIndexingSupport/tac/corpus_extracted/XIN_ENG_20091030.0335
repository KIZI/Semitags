The Immigration Department of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)
government Friday announced that HKSAR passport holders may visit Guam visa-free
for a stay of up to 45 days with effect from Nov. 28.

HKSAR passport holders are required to present their valid Hong Kong Permanent
Identity Cards upon arriving in Guam, the department said.

The Consulate General of the United States in Hong Kong recently informed the
Immigration Department of the decision and arrangement.

"We welcome the decision of the U.S. Government," a Hong Kong government
spokesman said. "The arrangement offers greater convenience for HKSAR passport
holders and helps promote trade, business and tourism links between Hong Kong
and Guam."

Including Guam, 140 countries and territories have granted visa- free access or
visa-on-arrival to HKSAR passport holders.
