uh oh...better turn it back over to the illegals! who's gonna cut the grass?

 

Americans cut the grass before the illegals came here and do it for 10 cents to the dollar the American's use to get paid. They say Americans won't do this work. This is Bullshit Americans will do this work for a good wage not the Illegal wage that the job is paying now!!! Once you give these people Amnesty they will be no use to the illegal employer who they are working for now. These illegals will want benefits and more money and will be let go for the new crop of illegals that will come here and replay the old illegals who will then be unemployed.

wow...jillian's so smart!!!

here's another headline....

"AZ Governor Doesn't Care About Convention Cancellations"

I think she's more concerned about upholding the laws of this land, put in place to protect it's citizens.
 
 
There are two states that actually have budget surpluses. Montana and I imagine Alaska. Arizona needs to hang tough. The small whiny/petty leftist boycott isn't a reason to abandon their sovereignty. Just layoff the illegals. What problem?

Well, it is going to be interesting to see how this plays out. You Arizona Conservatives stick to your guns, by all means.
 
 
I just am perplexed by so called Americans who want to punish Arizona for upholding the "rule of law" Is it just me  
 
 
 
..the all star game that wont happen,

 

thats because its not in Arizona this year.....but nice try throwing that in there....somewhat dishonest....but nice try....

Is the law making a difference? Are officers really stopping people and finding illegals? Haven't see much about this, just a lot demonstrations and boycotts,
 
 
Yes the law is working great. Just not in the way most of us thought it would. What will happen when the businesses in Phoenix fall on hard times? They will cut employees. Where are the illegals going to go to find work? Can you say Los Angeles? This law was brilliant.

yea more shit from Rdeans Left Nut.....i just saw on NBC news Brewers Approval ratings have gone from 40% last month to 56% now.....gee imagine Political Junkies surprise....a Gov. with enough guts to tell the Feds to either do your jobs or get the fuck out of the way....they sure as hell did not have that when the big cheese at HS was the Gov......this womans got more balls than any Legislature in my State....thats for dam sure....

"AZ Governor Doesn't Care About Convention Cancellations"

She will care pretty soon, they did back in the 80s.
 
 
 
Maybe, I missing it, but I haven't see any article about arrests as result of the new law.

 

Laws don't go in to effect immediately following a signature.
Without looking, it probably goes into effect July1 or Jan 1
 
 
 
Yes, Willow, it is just you. The rest of us realize that the idea of a officer being able to stop you for no reason, demand papers, and take you to jail if you do not have proof of citizenship on your person is antithetical to our legal traditions.

 

That is completely false. There has to be a "reasonable suspicion" that a law is being broken, ie speeding and etc. Federal law already requires resident aliens to carry registration documents. SB 1070 makes it a state crime to violate the federal law. This has been a law since the 40's but keep up the lies.
With all the gnashing of teeth by the left, I have seen 2 questions unanswered:

1.What can any Arizona law enforcement official do under the Arizona immigration law that a federal law enforcement official cannot already do?
 
2. What requirement does the Arizona law place on any non-citizen living in Arizona that federal law does already not place on any non-citizen living elsewhere in the United States?

The FACTS are that this bill mirrors federal law that was not being enforced.

Your spin is as bad as Obama's ice cream shop analogy. With the lies stated regarding this bill, USMB should change the name to the internet Enquirer.
 
 
 
 
Maybe, I missing it, but I haven't see any article about arrests as result of the new law.

 

Laws don't go in to effect immediately following a signature.
Without looking, it probably goes into effect July1 or Jan 1

 

I think it goes into effect 90 days after Brewer signed it, but I could be wrong.
 
 
 
 
uh oh...better turn it back over to the illegals! who's gonna cut the grass?

 

Americans cut the grass before the illegals came here and do it for 10 cents to the dollar the American's use to get paid. They say Americans won't do this work. This is Bullshit Americans will do this work for a good wage not the Illegal wage that the job is paying now!!! Once you give these people Amnesty they will be no use to the illegal employer who they are working for now. These illegals will want benefits and more money and will be let go for the new crop of illegals that will come here and replay the old illegals who will then be unemployed.

 

I cut grass as a way to make extra money and I could charge more if I didn't have to compete with companies that employ illegals.

Keep in mind that a large portion of the money illegals earn is sent home to Mexico. That takes it out of our economy with no taxes being paid on those wages either.

NICE TRY --BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT THE ARTICLE STATES---    

 
In the wake of the bill's passage last month, immigration rights leaders, including Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-AZ), have called for a nationwide boycott of the state. This week, at the request of Mayor Phil Gordon, a study was presented to the city council on the potential economic impact of canceled trips.

 

In Other Words--this was a study-- as yet NO ONE has cancelled a convention.

If you're NEW on this board--you must actually READ the links that liberals post--because they have a habit of trying to make a statement about a linked article that is simply not TRUE. This one is a good example.
 
 
I wonder if a representative who calls for a boycott of his own state could be subject to recall?

Phil is trying to sue the state to get the law overturned. He's a leftist moron. His own city council told him to FO. Who cares what he thinks?

Gordon, however, vowed to bring a privately funded suit on behalf of the city seeking an injunction against the law. Those words triggered cheers from opponents of the legislation that evolved into a small but boisterous rally outside the City Council Chambers.

Yeah--that's fairly below the belt--and you can bet he's certainly not well thought of by the business community or other political figures in Arizona.

In fact, I bet this backfires big time. California calling for a boycott just may be surprised to learn that many conventions that were planned in CA are cancelling to go to AZ--    

The arrogance of another state to put out a boycott against another is repulsing.

That's just it---this guy is STUPID enough to put out a boycott in his own state. It's recall time--this guy is basically a traitor to the financial well being of his own constituents. Unblievable IGNORANCE.

Yeah, I was just looking for it. I saw it earlier today, can't find it now. They did say the decision ultimately was based on Florida's importance as a swing state and the ability to raise money there. But someone did make those comments.

Edit:

Found it. Politico:

 Republican operatives say a camp within the party favored Salt Lake City because of the uncertainty in the Sunshine State's Senate and gubernatorial races. But others argue that if anything, the convention would boost the party's Senate candidate, Marco Rubio.
The operatives said Phoenix was eliminated, largely because Arizona in late August reminds Republicans of their sweltering 1992 convention in Houston. And the Grand Canyon State is facing boycotts because of its new immigration law, which would not present an inviting face for the party.
Choosing Utah would be taken as a sign of retreat — hunkering down in one of the nation's whitest states, the operatives said.

Thanks. Just goes to show that when it comes to immigration--both parties won't touch it with a ten foot pole--scared to death they will lose the Latino vote--in this country. So instead of actually doing something about it--which we have been promised by both sides of the isle for decades--they simply avoid it--and let someone else (like Arizona) deal with it--

You're right:

 
The passage of the law, which is slated to take effect 90 days after the current legislative session adjourns, prompted immediate and strong reactions.

What about this one?

The city risks losing as much as $90 million in hotel and convention business over the next five years because of the controversy, according to city estimates released Wednesday. The state's hotel and lodging association has counted 23 canceled meetings for a loss of between $6 and $10 million. On Wednesday, Los Angeles became the largest city to join the boycott.

Yes, Willow, it is just you. The rest of us realize that the idea of a officer being able to stop you for no reason, demand papers, and take you to jail if you do not have proof of citizenship on your person is antithetical to our legal traditions.

 

show us where in this Bill a cop can pull you over....for the hell of it....

 

What planet do you live on???????

The pigs have ALWAYS been able to pull you over.... "for the hell of it"....!!!!!!!

They just make up an excuse, no judge would ever question it, and the pigs know it.

I'm sure you've heard the expression "DWB" Driving While Black. Well if white person wants to know what that means just grow a beard and ride a motorcycle and the pigs will educate you.

For example, I was going south on my bike and a Pig passes me going north. In my rear view mirror I see him turn around in the middle of the empty wooded homeless road, so I knew he was going to pull me over. I made sure I came to a full stop at the corner before I made my right turn. Immediately after the turn the Pig pulled me over so quickly I didn't turn off the turn signal, (which do not turn off automatically on bikes for the information of those who don't ride motorcycles).

As he was checking my papers I asked him why he stopped me, and with the light still blinking, he said I didn't signal my turn. Obviously the pig was trying to provoke me!!!! I could give you a million other examples from the almost 50 years I've been riding a motorcycle.
 
 
 
 
 
most of us said that would happen the day the law was signed into law.

*shrug(

 

wow...jillian's so smart!!!

here's another headline....

"AZ Governor Doesn't Care About Convention Cancellations"

I think she's more concerned about upholding the laws of this land, put in place to protect it's citizens.

 

She will care pretty soon, they did back in the 80s.

 

Then why is it there are over 50% of all businesses here that HIRE illegals and there is a law on the books that makes it ILLEGAL to hire them?

This will turn out just like the MLK birthday celebration.....wait for it and literally mark my words here.  
 
 
 
 
The RNC chose Tampa over Phoenix. I wonder if it was coincidence.

 

Better strip joints in Tampa.

 

Thats how they roll baby!
 
 
 
 Phoenix Says Immigration Law Boycott Is Causing 'Near Economic Crisis' | TPMMuckraker 

Zachary Roth | May 13, 2010, 3:02PM

The City of Phoenix -- a convention hot-spot -- is facing a "near economic crisis" caused by lost revenue stemming from organizations canceling events in response to Arizona's controversial immigration law, according to its mayor. <more>

 

  Democrat Mayor Phil Gordon needs to earn a few political points by making stuff up. This should go in the humor section.

I was heavily attacked yesterday in another thread for stating that this law will stay or fail due to it's economic impact. This thread and the original post I believe prove my point. SC conceded within a few weeks after a few events were canceled due to their intent to keep the Confederate flag flying on the state house grounds. It's just a matter of time follks......
 
 
 
What planet do you live on???????

The pigs have ALWAYS been able to pull you over.... "for the hell of it"....!!!!!!!

They just make up an excuse, no judge would ever question it, and the pigs know it.

I'm sure you've heard the expression "DWB" Driving While Black. Well if white person wants to know what that means just grow a beard and ride a motorcycle and the pigs will educate you.

For example, I was going south on my bike and a Pig passes me going north. In my rear view mirror I see him turn around in the middle of the empty wooded homeless road, so I knew he was going to pull me over. I made sure I came to a full stop at the corner before I made my right turn. Immediately after the turn the Pig pulled me over so quickly I didn't turn off the turn signal, (which do not turn off automatically on bikes for the information of those who don't ride motorcycles).

what no quotes from Rush?.....not every "PIG" is like that dipshit....maybe if you would clean yourself up and look half-ass human you would not get pulled over all the time.....your one of those assholes who undoubtedly has an attitude toward cops....just calling them "pigs" tells me volumes about you and how you view them....

What does this thread have to do with pigs?
 
 
 
I just am perplexed by so called Americans who want to punish Arizona for upholding the "rule of law" Is it just me  

 

it is amazing...the economy is not doing so well, so lets hurt people's livelihoods because of a law that seeks to only enforce federal law and specifically makes it illegal to profile based on race...

I agree...Arizona should spend more resources prosecuting employers. It is the employer who is making money off illegals and giving them a reason to come here
 
 
 
 
The RNC chose Tampa over Phoenix. I wonder if it was coincidence.

 

Better strip joints in Tampa.

 

But the strip joints hire illegals as dancers....Republicans just can't win
 
 
Is the Mayor of Phoenix a Democrat or Republican? Knowing this will clear up any disingenuous B.S. There is a solution to this despicable Socialist/Progressive Boycott of Arizona...Boycott the Boycott. Stand tall America. Don't give in to the usual suspect "Community Organizer" cretins.
 
 
The Mayor of Phoenix is a Democrat. No surprise there. Just more disingenuous race-baiting coming from another Socialist/Progressive Democrat. Stay strong Arizona.
 
 
 
I agree...Arizona should spend more resources prosecuting employers. It is the employer who is making money off illegals and giving them a reason to come here

 

the Employer is making money off the Illegals....and thats the reason they want to come here?.....is that what they tell you in Jersey Rw?....
 
 
 
 
 
OMG!!!!.... 3 canceled.....i wonder how many are going to take their place.....if this place booms with Conventions and Tourism this summer Junky....will you report on that?....or just do what you usually do....go on to another thread?....

 

The rnc convention..the all star game that wont happen, the dnc convention WILL NOT COME HERE...oh yeah, no biggie.

 

and if 50 take their place....then what are you going to say?...........and Zona why dont you wait for these things to happen before you start the moaning and the lamentations....you sound like all these idiots crying about police civil rights violations that havent happened yet....i just saw few different polls on this....both said around 60-70% of the country kinda agrees with this....and one taken in my LIBERAL valhala of a State said that 47% of Democrats polled here.... said they agree with it......if that many Democrats in this State actually like your new law.....your State just might be the trend setter in dealing with Illegal Immigrants....here is a few......

The reason why they come here is because WE HIRE THEM! If there were no jobs here, they wouldnt come. Period.

Its the LEGAL MERICAN BUSINESSES WHO HIRE THEM.....did you know that over 50% of businesses here hire them? There is a law on the books that says its illegal to hire them, yet you over look that.
 
 
 
I agree...Arizona should spend more resources prosecuting employers. It is the employer who is making money off illegals and giving them a reason to come here

 

wouldnt that be a federal crime? it should be obama prosecuting the employers not the state. the federal government determines who can legally work in america, not the states.
 
 
Did anyone notice the mayor said near economic crisis. My guess is they were already at that level before the "boycott". Also, why did it take this immigration deal to cancel an out-of-state trip during California's budget crisis? Apparently in Claifornaia it is okay to waste money on trips, unless yo can make a political statement with it instead.

States and even local governments can enforce the law. Usually they create a parallel law on the state and local level to do that. Happens all the time. Case in point. Interstate highways have state police and county sheriffs pull people over all the time for speeding. The federal government sets the limits.

Every "Pig" IS like thart, that's how they earned the name Pig. Not every Cop is a Pig but there are Pigs on every police force.

My cousin is a Cop and he is not a Pig. Several of my friends I grew up with are Cops who also ride bikes and are not Pigs and they will all admit there are many Pigs in the police force. They too have been stopped for no reason when they are on their bikes and out of uniform.

And just because I don't look like a sissy like you, doesn't mean I don't look "human" simply because I have a beard. If you ever reach puberty you too might be able to grow a manly looking beard.  
 
 
 
 
 
Yes, Willow, it is just you. The rest of us realize that the idea of a officer being able to stop you for no reason, demand papers, and take you to jail if you do not have proof of citizenship on your person is antithetical to our legal traditions.

 

show us where in this Bill a cop can pull you over....for the hell of it....

All of which has absolutely nothing to do with the bill. There is nothing in the bill giving the police rights to do what you stated happened to you. More to the point, some questionable language was changed in the legislation to make the law clearer.

That is completely false. There has to be a "reasonable suspicion" that a law is being broken, ie speeding and etc. Federal law already requires resident aliens to carry registration documents. SB 1070 makes it a state crime to violate the federal law. This has been a law since the 40's but keep up the lies.
With all the gnashing of teeth by the left, I have seen 2 questions unanswered:

1.What can any Arizona law enforcement official do under the Arizona immigration law that a federal law enforcement official cannot already do?
 
2. What requirement does the Arizona law place on any non-citizen living in Arizona that federal law does already not place on any non-citizen living elsewhere in the United States?

The FACTS are that this bill mirrors federal law that was not being enforced.

Your spin is as bad as Obama's ice cream shop analogy. With the lies stated regarding this bill, USMB should change the name to the internet Enquirer.

It has everything to do with the bill. "Reasonable suspicion" is nothing more than the cop's WORD that the car didn't come to a full stop or was weaving back and forth whether it was or not.

And if the original bill, that you never read, "mirrored" the fed bill, why did language have to be changed?????????

So you understand that others can prosecute in addition to 0bama's adminstration. That is good. The problem is bigger than what the federal government can handle or is willing to handle. They have more help now. Fixing a problem, so just relax.
 
 
Yea the "Boycott" has been going on all of one week yet Phoenix is crumbling. This Mayor should be recalled immediately or at the very least voted out of office. I think most rational Americans are pretty sick of the Socialists/Progressives and their love affairs with manufactured "Crisis." Everything's a "Crisis" with these nutters. Time to give em the boot. Make 2010 count people.

i dont overlook shit dumbass....i am a 100% for getting these people out of here....whatever it takes...even though i realize the long timers are going to be a different story.........try reading where others stand before you open your yap...

RW....you know...your leftist buddy....SAID...."It is the employer who is making money off illegals and giving them a reason to come here".....thats telling me...because the employer is making money by giving these guys next to nothing for working for them.....thats the reason they are coming here...to let those guys exploit them and make a bunch of money while giving them shit poor wages and shitty working conditions....if thats why the Illegals in your state are coming there Zona....then your getting all the truly dumbass ones....the ones in my state would say RW and you, for agreeing with him, are "Mas Putos"....those people have more pride than that Zona....

And if the original bill, that you never read, "mirrored" the fed bill, why did language have to be changed?????????

 

Unlike you and our Attorney General, I did read the bill when I downloaded it. It had to be changed to appease the liberals. That language is in the fed bill and if they ever enforced it, it will probably be amended. It did mirror the fed bill, the one which was not being enforced.
Why is so hard to understand that enforcing the fed bill hurts in the voting booth so most politicians stay away from it. If you have done nothing wrong, a stop by the police or "Pigs" as you so eloquently put it, is no big deal; However the illegals have done something wrong.
I notice no one, including yourself, has answered the 2 questions I posed:

1.What can any Arizona law enforcement official do under the Arizona immigration law that a federal law enforcement official cannot already do?
 
2. What requirement does the Arizona law place on any non-citizen living in Arizona that federal law does already not place on any non-citizen living elsewhere in the United States?
