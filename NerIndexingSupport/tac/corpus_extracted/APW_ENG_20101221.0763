London's Heathrow Airport is run by BAA Ltd., an airport operator formed in 1986 that now owns five other British airports.

-- Ownership: BAA was bought by ADI Ltd., a consortium led by Spanish construction company Grupo Ferrovial SA in 2006, when it delisted from the London Stock Exchange.

-- Operation: The company owns and operates six airports in the U.K.: Heathrow and Stansted in London; Southampton; and Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen airports in Scotland.

-- The company was ordered to sell Gatwick, Britain's second busiest airport, in 2009 to break up its virtual monopoly.

-- This year it also sold its U.S. retail management contracts and its stake in the Naples airport in Italy.

-- Staff: BAA employs around 10,000 staff, most of them in the U.K.

-- Regulation: BAA is regulated by Britain's Department for Transport, and the prices it charges airlines are set by industry regulators the Competition Commission and the Civil Aviation Authority.
