Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik has claimed that Taliban have killed
Baitullah Mehsood's father-in-law and several other people on suspicion that
they were involved in his killing.

Malik told the BBC Urdu language service that he has received credible
information from the same source who had provided intelligence about Mehsood's
death in a U.S. drone attack.

However there is no independent confirmation about the killing of Mehsood's
father-in-law Malik Ikramuddin.

Taliban have also not shown any reaction to the interior minister's claim.

Tribal, official and Taliban sources said Saturday that Taliban detained
Mehsood's father-in-law, his son Ziauddin, his brother Saeedullah and nephew
Iqbal Mehsood a few days ago.

They were suspected of spying on Mehsood, who was reportedly killed in a U.S.
drone attack in the house of his father-in-law in South Waziristan on Aug. 5.
Mehsood's wife was also killed in the strike.

A tribal elder stated that Taliban had also killed Mehsood's driver several days
after the reported killing of the Taliban chief.

Maulana Ikramuddin was considered as Mehsood's right hand and he had been trying
to broker a peace deal between his son-in-law and the top security officials,
according to sources.

The interior minister rejected ceasefire from a Taliban faction in the North
Waziristan tribal region and said that operation against the militants would
continue in the month of Ramazan.
