When advocates for judicial reform point to
examples of how money can influence courtroom decisions, they often
cite as exhibit A the case of Hugh M. Caperton.

It's not hard to see why. In 2002, a West Virginia jury awarded
$50 million to Caperton after finding that the powerful chairman of
Massey Energy, Don L. Blankenship, had set out to financially
destroy him and his small coal company. Even as this state's
highest court repeatedly threw out that award, though,
controversies emerged over ties between Blankenship and court
judges.

One judge stepped aside in 2008 from the case after photographs
showing him vacationing alongside Blankenship in Monte Carlo popped
up. Another judge recused himself after the U.S. Supreme Court
ruled last year that he should not have ruled on Massey's appeals
because Blankenship had spent $3 million supporting his election.

The machinations in Caperton's case served as a plot line in
John Grisham's courtroom drama, "The Appeal." In March, the West
Virginia court voted again to overturn Caperton's award, holding
for the third time that he should have sued Massey in Virginia, not
West Virginia.

On Tuesday, Caperton followed that suggestion and sued Massey in
Virginia. He and his lawyers also made West Virginia's justice
system a part of that filing, charging, among other things, that
the ties between Blankenship and the court justice who had
vacationed alongside him, Elliott E. Maynard, had made a mockery of
justice.

In a statement, Massey Energy, the country's sixth-biggest coal
producer, said it had not seen the new lawsuit. But the company
said, "Mr. Caperton's claims have been rejected by the West
Virginia court system multiple times, and we hope that his
attorneys have not decided to waste more resources by seeking to
bring a meritless case back to the Virginia court system."

Caperton's decision to forge ahead with his long-running battle
against Blankenship comes as Massey confronts other issues. For
one, federal officials are continuing to investigate the cause of
an April explosion at a Massey mine in West Virginia that killed 29
miners, the coal industry's worst disaster in 40 years.

The legal fight has left Caperton, a tall, soft-spoken man of
55, badly battered. Twelve years after the first lawsuit was filed,
he remains unemployed, in debt and barred by the federal government
from owning a coal company. When Blankenship backed out at the last
minute from talks to buy Harman Mining, Caperton's company quickly
plunged into bankruptcy, and he defaulted on a bond that the
government requires coal companies to post to pay for the cleanup
of old mines.

Recently, Caperton has started traveling around the country to
speak about his case and judicial election reform.

He recently said that he had no expectation that his case would
end soon, but one day, he hopes, it will.

"I would love one day to wake up and not think about Don
Blankenship and what I've been through," he said.
