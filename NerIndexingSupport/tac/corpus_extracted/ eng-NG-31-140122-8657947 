Yet Another Spy Comes to Town
Yesterday, the Patriots released WR Reche Caldwell, their leading pass
catcher last season -- a surprising move.

Today, guess where he turned up for a free-agent visit?

Yep, Weeb Ewbank Hall.

Even though they have six wide receivers on the roster, the Jets brought in
Caldwell for a chat -- a move that reeks of gamesmanship. It was first
reported on the Boston Globe Web site.

The Jets play the Patriots Sunday in the season opener, and there's probably
a good chance they tried to pick Caldwell's brain on the upcoming game,
hoping he'd spill a nugget or two from the Patriots' playbook.

This is not an unusual tactic for the Jets. A week ago, they brought in S
Artrell Hawkins, who had been released recently by the Patriots.
