Here in the SF Bay Area, we've had almost every Packer game
broadcast on the regular channels. We've only missed the Giants
game and the KC game (and that was re-broadcast on NFL network.)

Not  a bad following for the Packers out here, apparently.

Perhaps that's why Grinder's so annoyed.

It's been a pretty good year for watching the Packers here in Indiana
as well.  The 11-2 record doesn't hurt, we've got them on TV again
this Sunday.  Last year wasn't so good because the Bears were having
an up season, so they showed the Bears a lot.  In Indiana, if the
Bears are good, they tend to show the Bears, and if the Packers are
good, they show the Packers.  Fortunately, the Bears haven't been good
very often in the last 15 years or so.

My Bay Area friend from India claims that the majority of people he knows
(mostly Indian software engineers) all love the Packers.

Haven't noticed them wearing Green&Gold, but I'll keep my eyes open :-)

Kinda reminds me; a couple years ago, the week after Thanksgiving,
we went to Disneyworld for a week. I decided to keep track of all
the various pro football-related shirts, jackets, hats, bumper stickers,
etc., that we saw.

Packers had the most, barely beating out Pittsburgh and (surprisingly)
Cleveland. Dallas, NE, Chicago, and Indy  had relatively little representation
but what really surprised me was how little Tampa or Miami gear I saw (even
on the road to the Everglades through Miami and back through Tampa/St
Pete) and I don't recall seeing ANY JAX gear.

Kinda reminds me of the story you told 5 years ago, but with the facts
changed.
