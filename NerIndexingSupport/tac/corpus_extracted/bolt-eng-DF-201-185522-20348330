I found this interesting.

Bloody shame all round, hope resolves well

That name, Josh Timonen, rings familiar. He's the same guy who was behind the clamping down of the Richard Dawkins forum. I wonder if Dawkins now looks in a different light to that episode...
 
 
So he is. Well, that'll resonate with all the forum refugees.
 
 
It is sad, even more so because Timonen and Dawkins had been close friends (see the dedication page for The Greatest Show on Earth ).

 Here's  a blog post with some behind-the-scenes perspective on the closing of the forum.
 
 
That's what you get for trusting an atheist (nobody ever embezzles money from churches).
 
 
Wow. He didn't just skim off the top, he took everything and left the skim. From a charity. And he was on $100,000 a year too. Greedy little bugger.

Eh anecdotaly it been something I've seen a fair bit with small charities of late. Perhaps I just know about the wrong charities.
 
 
Tinomen is certainly in the wrong, but I found this a bit nauseating (from the article):

 
In his 18-page complaint, Dawkins describes himself as "the world's best known and most respected atheist."

 
Seriously? He has the nerve to call himself the 'most respected atheist'? Best known I understand, but it takes cajones to call oneself the 'most respected' anything. My Dawkins love is falling a few major pegs.

Well, I am sure he didn't write that document himself, but I see where you're coming from.

Yes, it doesn't sound like something Dawkins would say about himself.

I hope that SOB Timonen gets his luxury homes, allegedly improved by the foundations money, seized by the courts.

In any case the likes of stalin and the chinese leadership are probably the best known athiests.
 
 
Hey, crap happens, humans being human, ragrdless of religious belief or lack thereof. I critisiced Timonen on my blog over the forum closure fiasco - yes the ex-members in exile are celebrating (how I heard -  http://www.rationalskepticism.org/ne...en-t14455.html  ) but it's just one of those things. Felt sorry for Dawkins though - but I will wait for the court judgment before I take it all too seriously. There might still be some misunderstanding or something

KateHL says Tinomen is certainly in the wrong, but I found this a bit nauseating (from the article):

 
I guess guilty until proven innocent is the theory here.
I wonder if he also looking for criminal charges or just money.
 
 
Yes, let's please remember the adverb "allegedly" here, okay?
 
 
 
Timonen and Dawkins had been close friends (see the dedication page for The Greatest Show on Earth ).

 
When some people at the forum were pissed off about things being changed or the forum closing, Dawkins apparently always defended Timonen and all that he did, essentially saying if you have a problem with JT, you have a problem with RD.

14 pages in 9 hours!

I didn't really follow the details of that mess when it was happening. Did people who didn't like it or some aspect of it tend to blame JT and not RD?
 
 
Yeah, he was responsible for the decision to close the forum -- from my blog

but rather shorter and better (as they were all written as events transpired), and from a former mod (Peter Harrison)  http://realityismyreligion.wordpress...ill-open-soon/ 

Even shorter, JT closed the forum, the mods and admin staff were sidelined, RD came to JT's defence when he was criticised, and now many of the ex-forumites are rather amused at the turn of events.

Unless there was a written work-for-hire contract, it's going to come down to the exact nature of the relationship between Dawkin's foundation and Timonen. There is some mention of Timonen working through his own company, in which case he was not legally an employee of the foundation. If the works in question were produced under that arrangement, then without a written work-for-hire agreement the works belong to Timonen.

I myself have run into work-for-hire disputes before. Unless you're an employee or you otherwise agree in writing to relinquish ownership of works you produce, they're yours.

While I still absolutely love Richard Dawkins, perhaps he has learned a lesson from this about being too proud to admit he hired the wrong guy

Life is a learning experience

Excellent point daSkeptic!

That was my undertanding as to how the law applies here in the UK as well. As the company was independent fo the charity, the creator of the goods well may be legally the owner. Best wait and see. I still think this may resolve amicably, but I have no vested interest either way.

According their 2008 and 2009 Form 990 filings, Timonen was not an employee at all. He was a contractor. He claimed rights to the DVDs, but contributions to audio-visual productions are specifically exempted as being considered work-for-hire, so his claim there is wrong. As for the website and the logo, if there's no work-for-hire contract, there can still be the issue of joint copyright if they worked cooperatively. If the foundation wrote the blurbs for the DVDs (like if they were taken directly from the DVD cover or included quotes from the DVD itself), the copyright will most likely belong to them, and that will be resolved with the effort put into making it into a web page.
 
 
 Timonen's response .
 
 
 
... but I will wait for the court judgment before I take it all too seriously. There might still be some misunderstanding or something...

 
My crystal ball says this never sees the inside of a courtroom. There will be a negotiated settlement which will include the proviso that the parties button their lips. In this case, you'll never get the full story.
 
 
Its all falling apart  
 
 
 
Timonen's response.

 
After composing an eloquent, thoughtful, nuanced, and reasoned post on his blog, Timonen worked out the remainder of his teen angst by slamming his bedroom door shut, heaving himself onto his bed, and screaming along with the All-American Rejects.
 
 
Why did Dawkins put so much faith in this man?
 
 
 
Yes, let's please remember the adverb "allegedly" here, okay?

 
Also, that JT is apparently a member here, too.

I seriously doubt he wrote that himself. He's always rather humble in his books, at least. Maybe he's getting senile.
 
 
Complicated. Doing business with a friend is ever fraught with danger, even if both parties see themselves as honest. One man's idea of reasonable reward can be another's idea of embezzlement.

I can't, personally, see what the age of Timonen's girlfriend has to do with anything.

I also have problems understanding what the RDF auditors were doing throughout all this.
Are such trusts subject to audit, as a PLC would be? I have no idea. I do know JREF, as a 401 charity, IS required to produce annual financial statements.

As for JT's response, his memory of his own conduct during the RDF forum shutdown seems to have been airbrushed a tad.

Dawkins is old school. If he thinks he / RDF has been the victim of a crime, I suspect he will pursue it to a possibly excessive extent. Whether that would be in the interest of RDF is open to doubt. The legal niceties of intellectual property ownership must be sorted first though. Maybe JT had a legal right to what he took. If the numbers are remotely correct, I cannot see how he could claim a moral right.

My psychic powers predict some lawyers are about to get richer.

Just as an aside, I do business with friends/family one of two ways. Either I charge my "best customer" rate and treat them like a customer or I substantially discount it (or do it for free) with the understanding that regular customers come first. I give them the choice up front, and it really does help reduce bad feelings.

I'm not an expert on the law, but I don't think audits would have been required for RDFRS. Their yearly revenue was under $400K, and I don't think audits became required until you're in the $2M range (not 100% sure).

I'd say that's a fair assessment. It will be interesting to see how this plays out.

Well, I'm not celebrating. But I don't feel particularly sorry for either Josh or Richard either.

Nothing. Actually, as far as I know, his girlfriend doesn't have anything to do with the matter at all. I'm having trouble understanding why she's even being discussed.

 
As for JT's response, his memory of his own conduct during the RDF forum shutdown seems to have been airbrushed a tad.

 
Just a wee bit. I wonder if he remembers who deleted a number of members' entire posting history.

Ha! Well, I don't believe he's really sorry anyway.

So Josh isn't here yet? I, for one, hope he doesn't join up.  
 
 
 
 Timonen's response .

 
Interesting... it seems to be mostly about the forum closing, instead of being about the lawsuit.

 
Why did Dawkins put so much faith in this man?

 
When it seems to be earned by experience, reputation, or evidence, it's not faith. The word then is "trust".

 
I'm not an expert on the law, but I don't think audits would have been required for RDFRS. Their yearly revenue was under $400K, and I don't think audits became required until you're in the $2M range (not 100% sure).

 
Remember to do the conversions; they use metric money over there.

 
I wrote a quatrain when I was 17 that predicted this lawsuit.

 
I'll admit that the bit about the two owls seems to fit, but which one is the one that ate the snake, and who's the snake? And seriously, that part about the river of orchids was just weird.

Well, allegedly she received some of the money under discussion, but her age seems to be irrelevant to that.

I was referring specifically to the RDFRS in the USA. I don't know where to find the numbers for the UK entity or their laws.

Ah, I must've missed that. But yes, her age is irrelevant. As are her looks.
 
 
From Josh's  blog  :

 
PPS: I should note that RDF have apparently removed my name off of articles that I wrote on RichardDawkins.net. Both ‘Surviving Jesus Camp’ and ‘Expelled Overview’ say they were written by “The Richard Dawkins Foundation” and not me personally. And they’ve also taken the line off of the website which stated “Designed by Josh Timonen”. Lovely.

Thanks, PY. What occurs to me is that what's more relevant is the audit requirements of Josh's company and where it was based since that's where the alleged malfeasance occurred.
 
 
I don't understand what caused the decision to offshore the store in the first place. The news report said it Charity Commission rues prohibited the store being in the UK, but that's definitely not true - plenty of charities use merchandise sales as a revenue stream!
 
 
Considering Dawkins considered this guy a friend, and even dedicated a book to him, I suspect this was not done lightly. It isn't done just at random.
 
 
 
It is sad, even more so because Timonen and Dawkins had been close friends (see the dedication page for The Greatest Show on Earth ).

 
"Close friends" or "Josh was playing Richard to get at about $650,000"?

I'm not familiar with UK law, so this post is based on information on the web. Apparently,  there are conditions  under which a charity must set up a subsidiary in order to trade in goods. There are also reasons to do it even if it's not required.
 
 
Looks like he had a very expensive girlfriend to entertain.

ETA: I'm talking about Timenon's girlfriend, in the article, I just realized my post could be misinterpreted as meaning Timenon's was Dawkins' girlfriend...

Yeah, one could hope Dawkins didn't need to be told there were instructions on the sole explaining how to dispose of liquid in the boot.

But so far it looks that way.
 
 
 
"Close friends" or "Josh was playing Richard to get at about $650,000"?

 

Perhaps I should have worded that "Dawkins considered Timonen a close friend."
 
 
 
I seriously doubt he wrote that himself. He's always rather humble in his books, at least. Maybe he's getting senile.

 
He is directly and personally responsible for the contents of any writ he issues. Every word of it is there at his behest and agreement.

As for humility, I've rarely seen it used as a concept alongside Dawkins. The RDF is a vanity project, pure and simple. His ego shines with every word he utters on the subject of atheism and religion. Please separate his elegant and graceful writings on biology from his strident error-strewn and sometimes intensely personal attacks on religions and on religious representatives.

As an atheist I've long been of the view that he pollutes the debate.

It upsets me because he was a stunning advocate of evolutionary teaching and his books really are superb pieces of work. The best contribution that he could make to naturalism and reason would have been to continue chipping away at that coalface where he was steadily chipping away at the front of creationism, ID and other such manifestations of fundamentalism.

Once he abandoned that valuable work and tried to attack the bigger issues he became an embarrassment.

This court case punctures his credibility in a big way. It exposes his serious lack of judgement and also exposes a problem with his charitable foundation, which was seemingly paying $90k a year for an entry-level and unproven webmaster.
 
 
I want one of these gigs. Does it matter that I can't code for **** or that I make "controversial" comments? I will change for 90K a year and working from home. Doesn't Randi clear over 200K a year?

I need a cushy job at a non-profit. Preferably one that I agree with it, but I will totally sell-out if the money's right.
 
 
 
I do, it must be hard for both, but I am laughing heartily after how they treated us in the past.

My apologies, yes not us at all! I don't think the JREF has ever had any relationship with them - I meant member of the Richard Dawkins.net forum cmmunity, of whom I was one. Now a lot of the old members lurk around rationalia.com (currently giving a malware warning), rantsnraves, ThinkingAloud and possibly the largest group are at rationalskepticism. I post heremainly these days as it happens, but I am Jerome on most atheist forums -- and oddly not an atheist, but very much part of the community, and very saddened by the whole mess. Just goes to show that ultimately ideology counts for less than community I guess - i'm pretty sure Doc, plumjam and I would be equally horrified if this forum was to be closed or the JREF ripped off -- but I can't see that ever happening.

From the link in the OP:

 
Timonen handed over financial books that detailed his embezzlement, Dawkins says, including $500 meals, trips to Timberline Lodge in Oregon and the Malibu Beach Inn, and $314,000 in "salaries" paid to Timonen and his girlfriend -though Timonen and the Foundation agreed that the $278,000 it was aware of paying him would be his combined salary for running the store and performing his other duties.
Timonen's "significantly older" girlfriend, defendant Maureen Norton, allegedly used at least $100,000 of the charity's money to upgrade her Sherman Oaks home before she put it on the market.

And when asked for comment, simply say "That would be an atheimenical matter"
 
 
While I can understand and sympathise with the mix of schadenfreude, unholy glee and (slightly smug) rectitude being displayed by the "RDF Survivors", I think they should remember that none of them (afaik) ever suggested JT was a common thief. He was criticised as uncaring for the RDF community, as uncommunicative, as a poor manager and as a less than first rate programmer- but nobody suggested he was on the take - so it looks like rather sour grapes to say "We told you so", when nobody actually did.
Also, it's possible all the "guilty till proven guilty" posts on the net could lead to defense claims that JT cannot expect a fair hearing- which is not what anyone involved wants.

Get real. First of all, you don't get excused from a civil lawsuit because some people on the internet have been talking about the case. Otherwise, every case involving a celebrity would have to be dismissed, among others. Second, let's get some perspective: outside of the online atheist community, this is a non-event. 99.9999% of the jury pool where this case was filed still has no idea who Josh Timmonen is.

We knew he was an *******. We just didn't know how big an ******* he was. The fact that he's a thief doesn't diminish his nastiness. I helped hundreds of people reposition themselves after the collapse, which he caused.

Gee, OK.

It was just a casual jab at anyone who would be amused that something terrible happened to Richard Dawkins for such a silly reason, but thanks for pointing out the obvious.
 
 
Nothing terrible happened to RD per se. It's the people who were trying to donate to charity that were allegedly ripped off.

You would be surprised at what some people feel should be an appropriate punishment for closing down certain forums.

not quite. Since the charity was in Dawkin's name, this, if what is alleged is true, would seriously damage his reputation.

Tinomen is certainly in the wrong, but I found this a bit nauseating (from the article):

Seriously? He has the nerve to call himself the 'most respected atheist'? Best known I understand, but it takes cajones to call oneself the 'most respected' anything. My Dawkins love is falling a few major pegs.

 
Richard Dawkins had no hand in writing it. It was written and submitted entirely by his California lawyer.

Of course, I don't know how this stuff works, so if RD signed off on it, then... well... it still shows (something I've always suspected) that he severely needs a dose of humility.

But anyways...

It is but it is also a civil matter if you want to sue to get your money back and claim damages. Total suit is for about 890K.

The bit where it gets messy is that it is for breach of oral contract and for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. It looks like the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science were dealing with rather large amounts of money in a not very proffesional manner.

Ignoring Timonens dirrect pay they made a further two payments totaling $25K to the US operation. They aparently got a total of $30K out. So even on the information they had availible it didn't look like they were getting a very good deal.

As geni said, plenty of wrongs can be the subject of both criminal and civil suits. Generally speaking, if you've been harmed by the wrongful act of another, you have the right to bring a civil suit independent of whether the district attorney chooses to bring criminal charges. (Or even if the defendant is acquitted of the criminal charges, as O.J. Simpson can tell you.)

I suspect this lawsuit will be removed from state to federal court. In the U.S., the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over copyright cases. While Dawkins isn't alleging copyright infringement, he is seeking declaratory relief regarding the ownership of the copyrights.

Of course not. It isn't even certain yet that he actually IS a common thief. Innocent until proven guilty and all.

However the court decides, though, this is going to be a major blow for Dawkins and for the RDFRS.

While I can understand and sympathise with the mix of schadenfreude, unholy glee and (slightly smug) rectitude being displayed by the "RDF Survivors", I think they should remember that none of them (afaik) ever suggested JT was a common thief. He was criticised as uncaring for the RDF community, as uncommunicative, as a poor manager and as a less than first rate programmer- but nobody suggested he was on the take - so it looks like rather sour grapes to say "We told you so", when nobody actually did.

 
No-one accused him of being a thief, but he was certainly accused of being extremely dishonest and trying to cover his own tracks, while Dawkins was accused of not caring and paying any attention to things. This new mess has been caused by Josh being extremely dishonest and covering his own tracks, while Dawkins apparently didn't pay any attention to things. The details may be different in the two cases, but I think there's reasonable scope for "we told you so" there.

 
As an atheist I've long been of the view that he pollutes the debate.

It upsets me because he was a stunning advocate of evolutionary teaching and his books really are superb pieces of work. The best contribution that he could make to naturalism and reason would have been to continue chipping away at that coalface where he was steadily chipping away at the front of creationism, ID and other such manifestations of fundamentalism.

Once he abandoned that valuable work and tried to attack the bigger issues he became an embarrassment.

 
My feelings almost exactly. I've always loved his biology books, but the more I've seen of his anti-religious side, the less respect I've had for him. The evangelical, fundamentalist atheism of Dawkins achieves nothing other than to make the creationists' straw man a reality.

I pretty much agree with this. Though I sometimes wonder if maybe it's useful to have someone shrilly advocating an "extreme" anti-religious viewpoint as it stretches the bounds of what might be considered acceptable discourse and makes the rest of us athiests moderately spoken views seem sweetly reasonable in comparison.
 
 
I cannot fathom why people react so negatively to Dawkins.

Are Atheists supposed to politely "get along" and hope that nobody notices them?

Or is the objection that he is publicly an Anti-theist? Is that not an issue one is supposed to moot?

You cannot destroy religion (or begin that process) without pissing off religionists.

People are not annoyed at Dawkins in this instance. In fact, the religious response has been one of "hey, happens to us all" largely - good thread here on Ship of Fools a British Christian website -  http://forum.ship-of-fools.com/cgi-b...c;f=2;t=015146 

I may get round one day to blogging about where my disagreement with Dawkins lies, but largely its in the fact I think that his extremely lucid and intelligent science writing has been devalued in the eyes of those who could learn the most by his strident anti-religious claims, many of which are based in the conflict myth of religion and science. I have problems with Dawkisn weakness in Philosophy, but more especially in his failings in grasping historical facts, and I particularly object to his conflation of science and scepticism with atheism.

Meh. While The God Delusion was certainly not on the level of Selfish Gene or The Extended Phenotype, it was still a great book. I don't know how effective Dawkins' approach is, and I do think he exaggerates the issue at certain times. It seems that he gets very, very emotional when it comes to certain topics (amazingly, you can almost see his anger through the pages - computer virus footnote in second edition of Selfish Gene comes to mind) which makes his writings a bit less appealing. The subtle humor and light tone that runs through his other works (which is less prominent in TGD) is part of what makes them so great, along with his occasional toss-ins about politics, fads and trends he finds repulsive.

There's certainly nothing wrong with his logic or reasoning, however.

The same as yours:

collective work, as a part of a motion picture or other audiovisual work..." Based on what we know, I can't see how Timonen could claim intellectual property ownership of the DVDs.
 
 
 
In any case the likes of stalin and the chinese leadership are probably the best known athiests.

 
Historically perhaps. John Lennon might best them if he really was an athiest.

Dawkins is very likely the best (living) person in the world known primarily for his atheism. But I'd say there are dozens or hundreds of better known athiests than Dawkins. Like Keanu Reeves, Billy Joel, Ian McKellan, Lance Armstrong, Bruce Willis, Angelina Jolie, Pat Tillman, Roger Waters...surely many more who have simply never made public their athiesm.

As for the topic, I can't help but being amused. What a train-wreck and plenty of blame to go around to all involved. Way to run a charity!
 
 
Though I bought a few books, and support him as a writer, I never felt obligated to contribute to Dawkins. It is of course a mission for many, even the foundation here, to spread understanding of these...to some mysterious...things. I think these types of organizations are needed, but are still quite new. The internet really changed the face of atheism.

No opinion on Dawkins & Timonen at this point.

The entire quote is as follows (emphasis mine):

 
... a work specially ordered or commissioned for use as a contribution to a collective work, as a part of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, as a translation, as a supplementary work, as a compilation, as an instructional text, as a test, as answer material for a test, or as an atlas, if the parties expressly agree in a written instrument signed by them that the work shall be considered a work made for hire.

The entire quote is as follows (emphasis mine):

 
I feel pretty confident that Timonen is not going to claim it's not a work for hire when he signed an agreement saying it was work for hire. Therefore, we're looking at what would happen absent such an agreement. And absent such an agreement, working on an audiovisual production is a work for hire unless the parties stipulate otherwise, which is the opposite of most other works.
 
 
 
Are those actually atheists or did you just list famous people?

I searched the internets and those more-well-known-than-Dawkins names came back (among others but I didn't want to list everyone) as athiests from several websites, and some of them had quotes from them to that effect. Not 100% positive though.

I think this is exactly what the issue is. Very few religious people are out to destroy atheism, they will advertise their believes, but their message is for those that are receptive, not for those that aren't and the majority aren't interested in forcing it on everyone else, it's a personal choice. Those that get pushy about it generally get a negitive result.

Dawkins and his ilk of militant atheists are out to destroy theism. They don't care about other people's choices, their goal is to get rid of religion regardless of what others want. Running roughshod over people's feelings will always result in a backlash.

In the end, yes atheists should politely "get along" just as they expect theists to do.

They shouldn't. However, the case against theism has to be robust and demonstrably true or very well evidenced for you to make the claim they are a) wrong and b) supersitious. If you want to discuss the rationality of theism, then I will happily do so in a new thread, so as to not derail here. I'm away till next monday with very limited posting access, but I will happily discuss the point next week?

 http://richarddawkins.net/discussion...-greenberg-esq  In the linked statement, the RDF's US lawyer states the wording of the 18 page claim was his, not Dawkins'.
 
I am plaintiffs' litigation counsel. I drafted all the material contained in its 18 pages. The Complaint's language and allegations are written and made by me on behalf of my clients. The Complaint does not contain any quotes from Professor Dawkins or anyone at RDFRS and should not be attributed to anyone else but me.

 
ETA- From Josh Timonen's website:-
 
He has created websites, ad campaigns, artwork, music and videos for various companies and individuals including the SyFy Channel, New Line, Channel 4 (UK), Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, Michael Shermer, Brian Greene, Ideologie, Genius Products, Peace Arch, The British Humanist Association, The Days The Nights and many others.

 
That's a respectable (in these parts) crop of names. The sceptical establishment is really quite small and close knit. It seems probable that JT received word-of-mouth recommendations from well known sceptics, to have worked for such a selection. This seems (to me) somewhat at odds with the view of the RDF "survivors" that his work was slack. Were all these sceptical luminaries taken in so easily? Or is there more to this sad tale than we have yet learned?

The complaint says "....and perhaps the worlds best known and most respected atheist." I think it makes a difference having those few words there.

As for me, I'll be watching this with interest to see how it pans out. Seems from the complaint there was a serious lack of oversight there which would have given plenty of opportunity for fraud to happen if someone so desired to do so.

It doesn't really matter anyhow as it was Dawkins' lawyer who made the statement and not Dawkins (as everyone quite rightly pointed out to me). But had it been Dawkins' own statement, the 'perhaps' would only seem to indicate a false sense of modesty on top of the hubris.
 
 
Isn't asserting that one has/had a certain reputation necessary in order to make a legal claim that someone else has damaged it?

Because its the right of every human being to believe whatever they want to believe, whether you personally disagree with them or not.

This isn't really the thread to for it, so I won't go into things here. Suffice to say that my problem with Dawkins is not with his attacks on religion, it's the obsession with focussing on religion above all else, and particularly the expectation that everyone else should do the same. Throw in a fair bit of ego, hypocrisy and unskeptical behaviour and I see little reason to respect Dawkins as a person, no matter how solid the arguments he makes on some subjects might be.

First you started by saying militant Atheists (whatever that means) are out to destroy Theism. Nonsense. That's a complete strawman argument. People like Dawkins have no problem with people having their beliefs. What they reject is when those beliefs cause harm to others and that's what they voice their opinions on.

If you want to get into an issue of respect, then why not the issue of how most theists don't have this respect you speak of for others? No one has a right to respect. If someone comes along saying they believe Leprechauns are real, no one is obligated to respect that. This notion of one having a right to demand respect is absolutely absurd. And it's never expected outside of religion.

No one cares if you go around believing in Leprechauns. If you start taking away people's rights based on it, or start encouraging people to harm themselves based on this belief, then it's not something that should be respected. But more importantly,. simply speaking out against such things is not an issue of respect to begin with. Simply dismissing the arguments as disrespectful is simply a copout.

Interesting. It is hard to imagine how Josh Timonen is completely innocent in all this. This doesn't, in the main, sound like a fight over intellectual property to me. It sounds like Timonen was hired to run a web site and was paid for that function. I doubt that authorized him to take what he felt like from the proceeds.

And he could be in real big trouble if he made written misrepresentations about the operation of the website to the owners of the website. That sounds like straightforward embezzlement to me and people go to jail for that.

Anyone know the US legal system well enough to give us a rough time to completetion? Next november say?
 
 
It looks like there are motions scheduled to be heard on May 6. Depending on the outcome of those, presumably the defendants will then file their answer to the complaint and the matter will proceed from there.

It appears that the matter was commenced in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, was later transferred to the U.S. District Court of California, then eventually transferred back to the lower court again, where the plaintiffs have filed a second amended complaint, to which the defendants have responded with a motion to strike certain parts of the second amended complaint and a motion for sanctions. Those appear to be the motions scheduled for May 6.

So, the short answer to the question is: probably not any time soon.

It's really hard to say.

It looks like they're still hashing out the pleadings, with the hearing on the latest demurrer (objection to the legal sufficiency of the complaint) and case management conference to be held on May 6, 2011.

At that point the court might or might not set a trial date. Some judges like to wait until the pleadings are all set before setting a trial date, others don't. If there is a trial set, I can't imagine it would be any earlier than late 2011, and more likely some time in 2012 -- it depends on the state of the court's docket, how much discovery the parties say they'll need, whether any of the discovery is going to have to take place overseas, etc. And of course trial dates get continued sometimes.

On top of that, there's nothing magical about the trial date as the end point. Most cases settle. (I expect the parties will agree to go to mediation, and the judge will set a deadline to complete the mediation process. Nobody should read anything into that if it happens, because that's pretty standard practice in California -- it's not a signal that settlement is any more or less likely in a particular case.) Sometimes cases get decided before trial on motions for summary judgment. And judgments (whether after trial or otherwise) get appealed.

So basically: any time between a couple of months from now and a couple of years from now. Your guess of next November is as good as any.
 
 
Dawkins drops case:

 
Wed been litigating for nine months and estimated that it probably would cost at least another $100,000, Dawkinss lawyer, Blaine Greenberg, tells Mandrake. I recommended not to continue, entirely on a cost-benefit analysis.
Timonen, a web designer, claims that Dawkins dropped the case because of a lack of evidence.
