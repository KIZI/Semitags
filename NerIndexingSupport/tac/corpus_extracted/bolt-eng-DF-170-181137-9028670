Two inches of rain due by game time. Niners have a fast, vicious defense that stunts alot. Squishy field works against that. Eli gets time to throw.
Giants by 10.
 
 
niners niners niners... oh please niners. I want a 'Brothers" superbowl.

Mushy field destroys the passing game too slows the run game. Expect a low scoring affair.
 
 
Giants and Pats.

Pats.
 
 
If teams try and run more because of the weather it works in the 49ers favor with their tenacious run defense.

^^^^^^
This.

Though I'm usually wrong in sports.

Cheering for the Niners, betting on the Giants.
 
 
These teams should be merged, then moved to Virginia.

The 49ers have a grinding, torturous, pounding, running game that the 27th ranked NY defense simply cannot stop. Gore and Hunter will combine for over 200 yards running and 3 TD''s, Smith will toss at least two more in what will be a lopsided destruction of Manning and company. The 49 D will shut down the Giants. Sorry G-men, you shot your wad beating the Packers....

If those two teams played each other 6 times, they wouldn't score 52 points between them.

The Giants will be not only be defeated, they will be humiliated and shamed. It's gonna be an epic beat down like the 1993 NFC Divisional Playoffs....Some Giant players will retire after this one.....

 

 
1993 NFC Divisional playoff: 49ers 44, Giants 3
Dan Reeves had the Giants back in the playoffs after taking over for Ray Handley but this one was never close. It was the worst playoff defeat in Giants history. Ricky Waters set a single-game playoff record with five rushing touchdowns and Steve Young, still a year away from getting that monkey off his back in the Super Bowl, threw for 226 yards.

Phil Simms was sacked four times and intercepted twice in what would be his final game. It would be the end of an era. L.T. announced his retirement immediately afterwards.

"I've had 13 years of enjoyable times - I think it's time to call it quits," he said.

"I remember our playoff victories in our stadium, and of course I remember the playoff losses out there too, which were pretty rough," Simms said this week. "When we lost out there, we took beatings, and we knew when the game was over, they were the better team."

So Zander, ever been to the San Francisco Saloon in West LA? A couple of years ago my wife and I met went with my sister's family (two little kids, included) to Disneyland. The Niners played that W/E so we looked for a sports bar to see the Niner game. Found the SF Saloon in West LA; good food and good company on game day.

Sky's are gray and no wind at the 0925 30 miles due east of the 'stick'.

Oddly enough, I've been there a few times - they have awesome burgers and a nice laid back vibe. Cold beer helps too...!

There is a place right down the street on Pico (just east of the 405) called the "Apple Pan" that is a must visit next time you are in the area. Take the wife and kids, it's legendary....Huell Howser even did a show on them!

Frank's been saving it for today!! He will rush for over 100 yards and at least one TD today, guaranteed!!
 
 
Just in case...who is the Niners backup QB?
 
 
Giants 21
San Fran 16

Take it to the bank.....

Just in case...who is the Niners backup QB?

 

The 230 pound monster.....Colin Kaepernick. He's an animal.

 
Kaepernick is the only quarterback in the history of Division I FBS college football to have passed for over 10,000 yards and rushed for over 4,000 yards in a collegiate career. Kaepernick is also the only Division 1 FBS QB to have passed for over 2,000 yards and rushed for over 1,000 yards in a single season three times in a career (consecutively)

 

.
 
 
My gut says the Giants but if the Patriots beat Baltimore I will be the biggest 49er fan in the country for about three and a half hours.
 
 
My crystal ball says Giants.

niner's roll today.....

 

Thanks for the tip, we'll check it out. Yes, the burgers and the fries were great.

I went to the Niner game last week; it was the most entertaining game I've ever watched. I expect both teams are still high on last weel's wins - should be a great game and I hope your correct and the Niners roll.

  It was "old school" football - black and blue style! Loved it. The Giant "D" really stepped up and Eli forever dismissed any doubts about his "toughness". He took a beating!

It should be a very competitive Super Bowl.
