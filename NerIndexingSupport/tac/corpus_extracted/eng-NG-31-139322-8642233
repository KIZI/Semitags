Dear WILPF Members,

With the excitement of the WILPF Congress held in San Francisco still
in our memories, it's time to make plans for an equally exciting
Congress upcoming from June 25-29, 2008.

The National Congress Committee (NCC) is seeking nominations for a
2008 Congress Program Chair or Co-chairs.  The Program Chair has the
opportunity to assure that Congress is both substantive and fun.  She
and her committee will work closely with the Congress Coordinator and
the Site Committee.
All nominees must be WILPF members in good
standing.

If you or anyone in your branch is interested in this position, or
wish to nominate someone, or would like a copy of the Congress Program
Chair Job Description, please contact:

Sandy Silver, NCC Chair silver@cruzio.com

Jane Doyle, 2005 Congress
Coordinator jpdoyle@cruzio.com
