Robben and Heinze to Real Madrid, for 36 and 12 million euros,
respectively. Cicinho to Roma for 8 million, Belletti to Chelsea for
5.5 million.

Roma was smart, Chelsea perhaps less so, though the price is
reasonable. Robben is injury prone, and the price seems very high.
Heinze might be worth his price if he finds a place in the team. I am
not sure that this experienced thug is a proper replacement for
Roberto Carlos, but time will tell. Didn't Calderón and Schuster say
that they wanted "jogo bonito", unlike Capello? Mmmmm... I am still
wondering who will be a creative midfielder for RM. Guti? Mmmm.

Best,

Snejider. Actually Real Madrid is looking pretty good now. Plenty of
young players all over the place. I think a front line of Van
Nistelrooy, Baptista, Robben, Robinho and Snejider is very well
balanced with danger coming from both wings (Robben,Robinho), a good
distributor behind the forwards (Sneijder) and heavy fire power in the
middle (Van The Man, Baptista).Of course it is up to Schuster to leave
Raul on the bench and apparently this is not the case. Also 50% of the
players in the starting line up are new and I predict that Real will
struggle in the first half of the season until they adapt. But there
is no doubt that Real has improved a lot in quality in all the lines
from last year with the latest signings.

So let me get this right:
Incoming
Pepe 30 -
Heinze 12 -
Drehthe 30 -
Sneider 25 -
Robben 36 -

133MM spent

How many of these are starters?

I have not idea, but it's a lot of money. Actually, Pepe is a sure
starter, and I imagine Heinze will be number one in his position. The
others I don't know, it depends on the tactical scheme that Schuster
has in mind. He took a team that played with two tractors and is
trying to make something different, but I don't know what it is. It
hasn't showed yet in the field. Time will tell. Anyway, he can't
complain that he doesn't have enough players...

Also Metzelder, no ?

 

Good question. I am guessing Pepe, Sneijder and Robben were bought in
the hope they will be starters.

Other good question is who has been sold/ let go and for how much.

Helguera, Cicinho, Emerson, Beckham, Roberto Carlos are gone for sure,
though I can't imagine they brought in much money.  Reyes also gone, but
I assume his rights still belonged to Arsenal.

I can't imagine them hanging on to Baptista and Salgado (if he is still
there), so they could recoup some losses by selling them. Guti and Raul
should probably be sold, if any buyers could be found.

They also got rid of Cassano, but he may be on loan at Sampdoria, I
don't remember the details. And they did get 8 million for Cicinho, a
good deal for Roma, not so good for RM, and 5 for Emerson. But the
point is that they didn't sell any players for good money. There are
no offers for even the best players, like Ramos, Casillas, or for
players who have some credit still, like Robinho. People aren't
knocking at the door. And the RM youngsters don't have enough exposure
to be considered valuable by other clubs.

If RM wins titles, though, everything will be forgiven (not the debt,
of course). That's how it goes.

I think so. Sevilla said officially that they "rejected the offer" for
Alves. My conjecture, based on nothing, is that Chelsea wanted to
place some of its players as part of the deal, and Sevilla just wanted
money, not high-salary rejects. Now Sevilla has to deal with an angry
Alves, not an easy situation.

I dont know if I agree with that. Unlce Roman has the money, we all

asking price is too high IMO.

Yes. It appears the novelty of spending huge sums of money on players
has worn off.

Yes but he can't run the midfield. Guti and Diarra in the middle with
Drenthe, Sneijder and that pussy Robben on the flank is hardly going to
put the fear of God into teams. A strong side will take care of Diarra
and their entire midfield will fall apart. Real Madrid have adopted
Inter's fabulously successful 90's policy of pressing the rest button
every season and blowing insane amounts of money on players. Calderon is
full of shit, wasn't he supposed to be end the galactico era? So what
does he tell everyone, he's going to sign Kaka', Ronaldinho and Robben,
two of the biggest stars in the World and bona fide galacticos. Shuster
may well be a great coach but more importantly is he a great politician?
If he doesn't work out they'll go after Mourinho and for all his talk
he's a yes man at Chelsea. Only Capello, Lippi and Scolari could fix
Real Madrid's problems. The fans only have themselves to blame, they
voted Calderon in and voted Capello out.

For years Guti has had some great games and some terrible ones. Very
inconsistent.  I don't think a team with Real's pretensions can afford
to make a player like that an integral part of their future planning.
Having bought Diarra, Gago, Robben, Sneijder etc. for the midfield, it
would seem that he is not a big part of their plans.

Apart from the Robben signing which makes no sense, I think RM has
done just fine. Especially I like the age of the side they are
trying to build. The galactico era was a geriatric era, now they
are building a very youthful side. It will take time, but the
idea is good. I can see Barca fading within 2 years at the most
with their current crop, when RM should be coming into their own.
Of course this assumes they dont rush out and spend money on
the Kakas and Gerrards of the world.

We're talking about Chelsea's spending not Real Madrid.

Real Madrid's average age is below 24. Not only that but I believe
this is the strongest Real Madrid in 20 years. Just take a look at the
central defenders: Ramos, Pepe, Cannavaro, Metzelder. Four World class
players in that position. Never before Real had so many quality
defenders in the same team. Quaresma might be next.

Van Nistelrooy     Robinho
(Baptista)             (Raul)

Sneijder
(Guti)

Robben                                                        Quaresma

(Higuain)

Diarra
(Gago)

Heinze             Pepe                   Cannavaro         Ramos
(Marcelo)                    (Metzelder)                     (Salgado)

Casillas
(Dudek)

Best center forward in the World: Van Nistelrooy
Best left winger in the World: Robben
Best holding midfielder in the World: Diarra
Best central defender in the World: Ramos
Best goalkeeper in the World: Casillas

All this names are arguable but all the players I mentioned have a
possible claim to the title. I think it is a spectacular team with a
great future that still has a low profile. Pretty soon people will
take notice.

Your point is well taken: RM has lots of good players right now.
Schuster cannot reasonably complain that they don't give him players.
But because that excuse is out, the pressure on him (and colaterally
on the players) is going to be tremendous. If RM were a normal club,
he would probably build a fine team, sorting through the players,
finding the best position for each, discarding _a few_ at the end of
the season, bringing in one or two next year, etc. But RM is not a
normal club: they want immediate results. Thus, I fear for Schuster.

About Casillas: not nearly as great as the "bombo" press makes him out
to be. Right now I prefer our own Victor Valdés. Two years ago the guy
gave me nightmares, but he has evolved into a tremendously secure and
alert goalkeeper.

The real jewel of RM is Sergio Ramos, one of those players that only
appears once every several years. Diarra is a disciplined, hard-
working player, who has the qualities to lead the team in midfield.
Buying him was a smart move by Capello. I am not so sure about Robben,
though he is still young and may blossom in Madrid. Ruud has been a
known quantity for a long time; the main danger is that he get
injured. Age and injuries tend to go together, and he plays where it's
hot.

Best,

Calling all four of them World Class is stretching it.

No chance. Injury prone inconsistent wimp. In danger of becoming the new
Harry Kewell.

No, that's Gattuso.

World Class but not the best.

World Class but not the best.

It's a good side but too lightweight in midfield.

For all his complaining about the board not backing him last season,
Shevchenko's arrival, against his wishes, his issues with Arnesen and
the speculation over his future HE was desperate to stay. This season
Avram Grant arrives, further undermining his authority, but Mourinho
knows who signs the checks so shuts up and takes it. I don't think it
will be any different at Real Madrid. Mourinho needs to show he's got a
set of a balls and tell Abramovich to shove his job. Until then he's a
yes man.
