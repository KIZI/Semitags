Saw an excellent game this afternoon in the Unibond Division One
North as Lancaster City defeated FC United of Manchester 2-1.

The attendance was a whopping 2,257.

I really must get back to reality and stand in a crowd of less than
200 again! What with 3,600 last week - feeling quite claustrophobic.

Droylsden v City next Saturday.

How about 54 at Haringey Borough v Wembley in the FA Cup Extra Preliminary
Round?

Excellent afternoon after a poor start, Wembley looking the far better team
and at half time game was over with Wembley being 2 - 0 up and having missed
a penalty.

However the old adage of kill the game off couldn't have been truer as
Wembley stopped playing and Haringey got their reward with a contested
offside goal with 25 minutes gone and then an equaliser with two minutes to
go.

They held on and the replay is Tuesday and I might just go!

Very friendly club and was given a free can of Guinness after the game for
being their 'best spender of the day' :>)

£4 entry and a free programme plus Sky Camera (singular and hand held) in
attendance made it a very interesting afternoon all round.

Funniest thing was coming out of White Hart Lane station and going against
the tide of fans going the other way and then bumping into an ex-work
colleague with his wife and son on their way to the Spurs game who commented
I was a long way from Exeter and going the wrong way. Most bemused look when
I said I was off to Haringey Borough!

54 - that's more like it.

Got speaking to a family of FC United fans this afternoon - husband,
wife and two kids - they have given up going to Old Trafford, as on a
matchday it was costing them getting on for £90, with admission,
programme, food etc.

They never went to away games as they couldn't afford to. Now they
are following FC United home and away and enjoying themselves with a
lot less hassle and a lot easier on the wallet.

This afternoon adults paid £6, and the kids £3 each. programmes
£1.50p. I dare say the food was a lot less expensive than at OT as well.

One FC United banner summed it up perfectly - 'FC United - Football
For The Working Class.'

I was rather lucky, as I was able to sample a wee dram of whisky in
the boardroom prior to kick off. I also have a complimentary season
ticket.

I turned down the chance to sit in the grandstand, preferring instead
to take up my usual place on the open station terrace, stood near to
the halfway line, where I have got to know a couple of Lancaster City
fans.

Nice to see my article in the programme, which, like last season,  is
a regular feature.

Likewise Neil, a hugely enjoyable and entertaining afternoon. Look
forward to hearing about the replay if you do get along to it.

"How about 54 at Haringey Borough v Wembley in the FA Cup Extra Preliminary
Round where the score was 2 - 2?"

Just to finish off this story I decided I had to go along to the replay at
Sudbury Town where Wembley play last Tuesday evening - one stop past that
new building.

You could immediately tell they were in a league above Haringey with better
facilities and a properly enclosed pitch with cover on three out of four
sides.

I was made very welcome again and there was draft beer this time - Guinness
at £2.50 was very acceptable. The Hot food was also excellent and very
reasonably priced at £1.50 for a cheeseburger for instance.

Entrance was £4 and the programme was £1 and good value. You could walk all
round the ground and they had a nice little practice/training area within
their fences but behind a stand.

Wembley again were plainly the better team and bizarrely were again awarded
a penalty early in the first half and this time converted it.

They continued to dominate and again got a second before half time when we
were all allowed back into the bar of course :>)

Unlike the first game Wembley kept attacking in the second half and got a
third goal following which the Haringey heads dropped a little and they also
got a little physical.

As the drizzle fell the game played out and the better team got their reward
of a home tie in the next round against Ware at home.

The funniest part of the match was in the first half when I happened to have
gone past the rather 'large' Wembley keeper [should add he was quite
excellent and had a kick like a mule!] and noticed him calling to his bench.

They weren't noticing him and as I was approaching them I pointed him out to
them and a sub ran round to him. I couldn't hear the conversation but as the
sub ran back towards the building the keeper reinforced his message saying
"A mars bar or a Twix, anything like that".

The sub proceeded to run into the club house and then return carrying a Mars
bar which the keeper snacked on in goal whilst the game continued!

Oh and I should mention that it being a small world as always I bumped into
a Burnley Supporter who also attends APFSCIL meetings with me which was
quite a coincidence given the 'crowd' only totalled 57!

Oh the joys of non-league football. You always seem to come across
something that makes a great story, and was the reason why I wrote a
book about my travels around the Nort h West. Lots of nice people,
dedicated people, quirky stories and a cracking, inexpensive day out.
Thanks for sharing this with us Neil.

Sadly, due to personal circumstances (and not for the first time)  I
was unable to get to Droylsden today as planned, and had to opt for
somewhere much nearer to home.

I went along to the Unibond league First Division North fixture
between Chorley and Rossendale United,  The game ended 1-1, the
visitors equalising with almost the last kick of the game fro mthe
penalty spot - but they deserved to - and was watched by 285 spectators.

It proved to be a really good match, leaving both these teams
unbeaten so far this season. Gppd value and good entertainment.

I was kept in touch by mobile as to the City game at Droylsden, so
that made the afternoon go even better!
