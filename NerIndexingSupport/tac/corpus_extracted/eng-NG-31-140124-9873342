Big crowd in Beantown to watch hoops today.    Oddly enough, not too many
*'s jerseys are evident in the crowd like there used to be whenever the C's
have been televised.   Hmmm... gee I wonder why?  HAHAHAHHAHAHAA!!! Chokers!

Good to see you're a Celtics fan, as well as a three-time Superbowl champ
Pats fan!

Have you ever watched a Celtics game? Ever? If so, have you ever seen anyone
in the stands wearing a Pats jersey? Here's a link to a pic I took at a
Celts game this season against the Timberolves. Count the Pats jerseys, then
count the Celtics jerseys:

Note, from the EXIF info that this shot was taken on January 25th, the week
before the SB. I left the pic nice and big so you can count the fans in Pats
jerseys to your little heart's content, and report back on how many Celtics
fans wear Pats jerseys to the Garden, even the week before the SB! Have at
it...

BTW, the Celts beat San Antonio, despite missing Garnett and Perkins, two
starters. Just in case you missed the end of the game.

Sorry, this one is really, really pathetic...

I will admit, I appreciate the Celtics. If it weren't for them the Lakers
dominance of the 80's would have been boring. Watching McHale and Ainge
having tantrums every time Showtime kicked their butts was hilarious.

Pretty funny; I grew up watching the Celts, and watched them go 6-0 against
the lakers in the finals during the 60s. In the 80s, they were what, 1-1?
Showtime was a treat, for sure, though. I've never seen anyone run a fast
break like Magic Johnson.

Magic was a 6'9" Steve Nash. For me it was the team.  They had class on
and off the court and always played their asses off. Kareem, Worthy,
Michael Cooper, Rambus...those were the days.

Every time people mention Jordan's Bulls teams, I can only answer that if
they were around in the 80s, they would have been squashed by either the
Lakers or the Celts of that era. Magic and Bird in the league was unreal.

Was Worth that good, or was he "made good" my being Magic's wing man? Only
time I only got to see him a few times a year, and he was usually running
the floor and catching passes from Magic.

That squad was a GD track team, weren't they?

That's why I thought they were such a good *team.* Everyone was made
better by Magic and could play to their strengths. Worthy was a very good
player, and Magic had him bordering on great. If the team needed someone
to wear down the opponents defensively and physically, in went Michael
Cooper and Rambus. Jerry West deserved every bit as much credit for
putting them together as any player.

Just seeing those two teams on the floor together was sports at it's
purest and finest. They played hard clean and fair. If you wanna join me
in bagging on anything basketball, I'll assume we both hated Lambeer and
the Pistons.

Laimbeer was the biggest asshole to ever set foot on the floor. Total GD
animal, premier cheap shot artist of all time. And I'm including ML Carr,
one of the worst. ML would trip you, poke you in the eye, and the offer to
help you off the floor. He was the single person responsible for the total
collapse of the Celtics organization during the 90s. Somehow, he became
general manager and coach. He must've had pics. Anyway, Pistons sucked, and
won nothing until Bird and Magic were physically used up from beating on
each other. Man, I miss those Celts/Laker games. All the Celts fans, real
Celts fans hate the Lakers, but really, really loved Magic. If you ever saw
Bird's retirement ceremony, you'd be amazed at the reception that Magic got
by the Boston crowd. It was incredible. LA fans usually liked Bird, as well.
His first visit to the forum he lit up the Lakers, dominated the game, and
got a HUGE ovation from the Laker fans. Sports at it's best, no question.

And Laimbeer was their nicest guy....

Did you ever watch the TV show "Cheers?" Kevin McHale did a guest spot one
show, and, at some point, was looking at an x-ray of a broken leg (can't
remember how the plot allowed for that...) and read the label at the bottom:
'adult male gorilla.' He then remarked "must be Laimbeer's leg."
