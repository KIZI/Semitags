I would love to!

How many do you think we could get to play?
 
 
I already have a group set up at CBS Sports, so I guess now we just need people!

What's the group and how do we join?
 
 
Let me save you all some time: HEELS WIN !
 
 
OK, Everyone~

 - CBSSports.com News, Fantasy, Video 

I THINK I did this right, pm if I didn't.

~EZ

( I guess just put an email in there so I can invite you to join the group)
 
 
I registered as "peeejay" but it says you have to invite me to join before I can log in.
 
 
OK, as far as I know I have to invite you through email.

Whoever wants to play, just PM me your email.

If you don't want me to know your "real" email you can sign up for any account on a hot mail or yahoo.

I really do think it would be fun if we can get this going!
 
 
I'm not much of a sports fan, but I usually root for my alma mater: LSU.

They are playing my BUTLER BULLDOGS in the first round! (Butler is just 15 minutes from where I live)

You and I should have a side bet!  

You should sign up for the bracket challenge. After you pick your teams, you don't have to do anything else, but gloat or cry!

Let's see... Okay. If I lose, I'll part my hair on the right.
 
 
I'm in. All signed up and ready to go. But I haven't made my picks yet. I assume I probably have up until about a half hour before the first tip-off. Please let me know if that's not the case.

I didn't really try very hard, but I also didn't see a link to show who is in the group. How many are in so far?
 
 
I'm in.

I didn't take much time with my picks either. I went with Marquette to make the round of eight along with WV. It's time for Bob Huggins to make a move again.

Other than that, no surprises. Connecticut and the Heels in the big game, Heels win, of course.
 
 
OK, we have 5 signed up now. I'm home so I can get you signed up if you want! Feel free to play!

{I really do think I'm going to win this thing, but it will be fun for others just to see what happens. }

And it's NOT going to be North Carolina taking it all!

Yes it is ! Wanna start a bracket pool ?.....oh wait....you did.

Lawson will play and we will win. Same starting five that went to San Antonio last year. And Roy on the bench.....pffft....it's a no brainer.

Wake Forest, UConn, Duke and UNC. Then UNC over Wake Forest!

I do one at work, one with my college buddies and one with a few buddies in Chictown! Hell, what is another pool! Where do I go to fill it out.

Just so happens I had really good seats for the thrashing we gave Louisville in the regionals last year.

I made this to wear at the game.

Nobody matches up. We can only beat ourselves and after last year's loss in the Final Four, that won't happen again.

We're gonna make it Wayne !
 
 
Is anyone interested in doing a group on yahoo for brackets?
 
 
I have to agree with Peej.

UNC over Louisville in the final.
 
 
I say Pittsburgh.

Although Memphis and BYU are already fucking up my bracket. MFers.

Yeah, BYU screwed up. Those 8/9 games are tough. A&M has played well all year though and that game really was a toss up. Butler let me down too.

But Memphis ? You picked Memphis to exit in the first round ? You realize they played for the championship last year ?

I'm sad about Butler too, though they would have had to meet your dreaded Tar Heels in the next round. Memphis was almost upset. Can you believe Texas A&M has beat BYU 4 times in A ROW in the tourney! Crazy!

Oh, btw, Louisville is going to win it all.............................

BYU / A&M has been a toss up and I figured it was time for BYU to man up. They are a really good team.

You can't mess with the Heels. You guys won't even get the Chance.

We won a real nail biter today eh ?
 
 
For the record, and I see that the tie breaker could come into play, I screwed up my tie breaker score, entering what our score would be in the game. The total should be 174. EZ has a pre - deadline record of this.

They play North Carolina in Memphis next, I don't know if I am going to be able to watch. I think playing in Memphis will help them because Memphis fans would probably want them to play the Zags over NC.

Go Zags!

The last minute of tonights game was very hard for me. I was watching it with my dad and we scared my son when Gonzaga made the last shot to win it. Just say there was some jumping involved!
I will have to make a bet with Peejay about who is going to win.  
 
 
My only real upset pick (you have to make an upset pick, for fun) was WV. Bob Huggins is a really good coach, good looking young guys and he's back in WV. But they lost. Screwed my whole bracket. Doing OK around the rest of the regions. But me and Mani are the only ones with the right final pick and I don't think I can top him now. I think he's already got it in the bag.

The Zags are gonna get ripped. Duke goes down to Villanova, which will help my brackets and hurt the rest of you guys. But it won't be enough.

No matter though, Roy and the boys will be bringing the title home.

you want to bet on this? Not money of course, I will have to think of something????????????????????

 

Absolutely. The winner has to streak through here naked.[/QUOTE]sounds good to me!  
 
 
Probably as close as I'll get to the top......might as well enjoy !

1 Mani 65 43 169 53 North Carolina (160)
2 Peejay 58 38 158 47 North Carolina (92)

The rest...

3 Echo Zulu 57 39 161 49 Louisville (145)
4 Red dawn 56 37 112 45 Memphis (145)
5 Meister 52 35 140 44 Pittsburgh (8)
6 Article 15 50 34 146
 
 
Ouch.....the Zags got an absolute thrashing from the Heels.

Oklahoma is going to be a tough cookie.

I had to take my son the doctor at 8pm last night, same time as the game here. I am glad I didn't watch. here is me running naked!
Well NC better win it all now!
 
 
 
Oklahoma is all that stands between UNC and the title IMO. UNC will crush anyone else left, but OK scares me. It's all about matchups.

Yep. They match up better than anyone we've palyed this year. They have everything we have: Speed, size, talent and an NCAA player of the year. But Lawson is on fire. He has what he didn't bring to the tournament last year. I just think the boys in blue are on a mission.

It should be a good one.
 
 
No doubt.

If Lawson delivers, I think UNC will triumph. If he doesn't, they're in trouble.
 
 
Hi, I'm Article 15, and my brackets are fucked.
 
 
Yeah, Mani pretty much has this thing won.  

GO LOUSIVILLE!

I hate to cheer against a Big 10 Team (Michigan State) but I picked the Cardinals to win it all!

They are playing right here in Indy, wish I could afford to buy a few tickets to go watch them play!
 
 
I thought Mani had it won too, but he doesn't yet. He doesn't have Conecticut in the championship with the Heels. And I'm only 3 points out of first.

And that means this is a one posession game.

I have Louisville and North Carolina in the Final Game. If Louisville wins it all, I wonder if that's enough points for me to win..........

Yeah....depending on your points for today's games, you could still win the pool. The Chamionship is a lot of points and no one else picked Louisville.

But you won't win. It's time for Louisville to lay an egg.

The games are getting ready to start, we shall see. I'll be back later to either gloat or pout, depending on the outcome!  
 
 
I'm screwed.          
 
 
Yep. You don't get to play the community colleges all the way to the Final Four. Although Louisville tried. But alas, they had to play a real team.

Now for a real game, with two real teams. GO HEELS !!

Well, now I'm going to root for Michigan State to win it all. Big 10 needs to REPRESENT!

Plus, I love Tom Izzo!

That kid named Goran is pretty impressive. But I don't think there is a big man in the country that can match up with Thabeet....Dabeet...bigfeet......that cat in the middle for Uconn, except my boy Hansbrough. We're gonne see what the Okie from Muskogee is made of right here in a few minutes. I'm sure he'll get his points but we shoot inside, outside, left hand, right hand.......absolutely amphibious !!  
 
 
It's pretty simple now. Connecticut wins the next game and I take this pool.

GO HEELS.

No one's beating Villanova, baby!

Yep, you were spot on. A one man team can't beat the Heels.

And Villanova ? Congrats on over achieving but you gotta play the real deal now.

I'm a philly sports guy, so I'm riding the 'nova bandwagon right now. I actually don't care much for basketball, but it's always good to see philly teams on top. With baseball opening day less than a week away, I hardly have any attention left to focus on anything else.

I wasn't going to bring it up. But since you guys did.......yeah, you guys suck. And your teams suck even worse.  
 
 
 
 
damn, I totally suck  

 

No, I totally suck  

 

We all do! I thought FOR SURE I was going to win! That's what I get picking a team from KENTUCKY of all places!

Yep, and that means you especially suck. Dead birds.
 
 
I detect a little Heel envy here.

You all know the deal......get on board with the Heels !!

It's hard to understand him with that tarred heel in his mouth!  
 
 
Every spring, about this time, if you listen closely, you can hear the calls of the loser birds migrating home.

loooooouuu----sir.......looooooou----sir...we lost, we lost........loooooou---sir..........looooou---sir....we lost, we lost..............

It's one of nature's most distinct calls.
 
 
You will need a LOT of this after your heels lose on Saturday:

 
 
 
I was just considering that statistically speaking, there is 75% chance I will be eating humble pie by next Tuesday.

But, according to the experts, you guys will still be losers.

Your right there...but after your comments, maybe I can slice up that humble pie for you.  
 
 
If UNC beats MSU in the title game, I make some serious coin.

Slight problem......MSU won't be there.
 
 
Sadly, the only team I have that hasn't lost yet is the tar heels and since they beat oklahoma like they did, I'm glad I still have them. They have yet to let me down and CERTAINLY won't. GO HEELS!!! In case you can't really see that (or are ignorant MSU fans   ) it says GO HEELS!!!
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You barely squeaked by.

But you win. Congrats.
 
 
 
 

 

WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

It's Fate! It's Destiny! It's the SPARTANS!

Doesn't matter who wins the NC/Villanova game, Michigan State will win the National Championship on Monday! Heck, they even have HOME COURT!

Now you're just being delusional. Uconn was the only competetion for the Heels. You're gonna see one of the biggest blow outs in Championship history on Monday.

(Shit.....we gotta win this one first, don't we ?)

Is it too late to call my bookie?  
 
 
Uh, I'm picking North Carolina to beat Villanova

'Nova made a decent rally towards the end of the half. But, obviously, you can see THE POWER that is the Heels.

My daughter and I got bored with the game, she's watching "Scary Movie" on Comedy Central instead!  

We keep turning it back to the game every 10 minutes or so, maybe the second half will get more exciting!

Yeah, they had it easy with Villanova.

Monday night they play a REAL team from the BIG 10, where basketball rules!

You have to have a DUKE avatar if UNC loses Monday, how is that for a bet?

(And keep it up for one week)

Feeling almost certain about something still isn't good enough reason to wager something you're not willing to lose. PJ isn't willing to sport a Duke avatar under any circumstances. I think that's a bit silly but it's not my call. Why don't you simply suggest something else EZ?
