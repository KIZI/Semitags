The two football clubs from the city of Valencia have finally become good
neighbors again for the first time in 15 years.

Despite the two clubs sharing the same city, relations between Valencia and
Levante have been cool for the past decade and a half. Valencia has spent all of
that time in the BBVA Primera Liga, while Levante has lived through a series of
promotions and relegations.

Last season saw Levante return to the Primera Liga and the club is looking to
add to its squad for the forthcoming season.

This weekend has seen Valencia loan two players to Levante: Asier del Horno and
Nacho Gonzalez will play in the City of Valencia stadium for the entire season.

They are the first players that Valencia has loaned to its neighbor in the last
15 years. The last player loaned to Levante by its more powerful neighbor was
Miguel Angel Soria in the 1995-6 season and since then no other players have
been loaned across the city.

There is another reason for Valencia's generosity to Levante. The newly promoted
side will now pay the wages of both Del Horno and Gonzalez, giving some much
needed relief to Valencia' s fragile club economy.
