Texas Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, is trying to lower
expectations. Amid alarming declarations from the national
political punditocracy that the GOP is within striking distance of
picking of the ten seats needed to win control of the Senate, the
chairman of the Senate Republicans' campaign committee isn't going
along.

Cornyn says he's "praying for a tsunami," but still
anticipates falling a bit short of a majority. He forecasts a
"two-cycle effort" for Republicans to take back the Senate.

That may be so. But these ten highly competitive races will tell
us whether Cornyn or the Pundit Elite knows best.

NEVADA

This race is very, very important and very, very close.
Republicans would love to knock out the Senate's top Democrat,
Majority Leader Harry Reid. But the former pugilist is fighting
back. Despite poor job-approval ratings, Reid is in a dead heat
with Republican Sharron Angle, whose Tea Party ties and far-right
viewpoints have alienated many moderates and independents. An
indication of the dilemma facing Nevada voters: just 25 percent
think very highly of Reid and 18 percent are big fans of Angle,
according to a recent Rasmussen Reports poll.

FLORIDA

This three-way contest between conservative Republican Marco
Rubio, centrist Independent Charlie Crist and liberal Democrat
Kendrick Meek is a good test of the political tides in the nation's
most important swing state. Recent polls show Rubio and Crist
locked in a tight race. If Republicans manage to hold the Senate
seat being given up by interim Sen. George LeMieux, it is possible
that they will not surrender a single Senate slot currently under
GOP control.

WASHINGTON

Harry Reid isn't the only top Senate Democrat in danger. Patty
Murray, the fourth-ranking Democratic leader, has a serious
challenge from Dino Rossi, a center-right Republican who defeated a
Tea Party opponent in the primary. If Rossi can unify the
Republican Party, this state could swing Republican.

CALIFORNIA

A combative liberal, Barbara Boxer, and a combative
conservative, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, give
California voters a clear ideological choice. Working in Boxer's
favor: California hasn't elected an anti-abortion Republican to the
Senate in decades. Working in Fiorina's favor: Voters are very
unhappy with the status quo in Washington.

COLORADO

The appointed Democratic incumbent, Michael Bennet, turned back
a primary challenge and got the general foe he wanted: Ken Buck, a
Tea Party conservative who upset the establishment favorite in the
GOP primary. Bennet has staked out the political center, but
Colorado has elected doctrinaire conservatives in the past, and a
national GOP tide could sweep Bennet away. The best thing going for
Bennet: A huge Democratic advantage in the state's race for
governor.

ILLINOIS

It's a sign of how much trouble Democrats face in 2010 that the
race for President Obama's old Illinois Senate seat is up for
grabs. Two flawed candidates are trading nasty charges and harsh TV
commercials. Everyone in the Land of Lincoln knows that Republican
Mark Kirk has goosed his resume and that Democrat Alexi
Giannoulias' family bank had some customers who happened to be
mobsters. The Democrat has a narrow lead in recent polls, but it's
too close for comfort in this volatile election year.

PENNSYLVANIA

In a normal year, Republican Pat Toomey would have little chance
of winning statewide office in Pennsylvania. He's a hard-right
conservative in a centrist-leaning state. But it's not a normal
year, and Republicans seem poised to make major gains in the
Keystone State. Six years ago, Toomey lost the GOP primary to Sen.
Arlen Specter. This year, he may replace the party-switching
senator.

KENTUCKY

Rand Paul, a Tea Party loyalist and a strong libertarian,
shocked the GOP establishment in the primary by beating the
hand-picked choice of Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell -- in
McConnell's home state. The Democrats have an attractive, centrist
candidate in Attorney General Jack Conway. Recent polls are all
over the place: two show a close race, others give Paul, the son of
Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, a big lead. Conway's only hope is to paint
Paul as an extremist who cares more about ideology than Kentucky
voters.

WISCONSIN

Ron Johnson runs a plastics business in Oshkosh, Wis. He says he
knows how to create jobs -- something that's important to voters in
this economically depressed heartland state. But there's one man
he'd like to see out of a job: Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold. The
Republican nominee portrays Feingold -- a Democratic maverick who
often teamed up with Republican John McCain in the past -- as a
traditional big-spending, job-killing liberal. Feingold's heard it
all before ... and survived. But with some polls showing him behind
his challenger, he's running scared in 2010.

CONNECTICUT

If Connecticut's Senate contest is still up for grabs on
Election Day, then Republicans may be on their way to a Senate
majority. Republican Linda McMahon, a longtime professional
wrestling executive, spent more than $20 million of her own money
to win her party's nomination, but she still trails her Democratic
opponent, state Attorney General Dick Blumenthal. McMahon is hoping
to close the gap by attacking the Democrat's credibility, including
misstatements about his military service and campaign
contributions.
