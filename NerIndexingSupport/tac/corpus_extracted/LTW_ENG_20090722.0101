The nonprofit dispensary, Roscoe Compassionate Collective, advertised
the offer last week in Kush L.A., a monthly cannabis magazine, with a
pull-out coupon for patients with medical-marijuana cards and updated
prescriptions. Since then, the collective has fielded hundreds of calls from
people essentially asking the same question: Is this for real?

JT Wiegman, 37, the owner's son, said it was indeed, and as of 11 a.m.,
they began giving 3.5 grams of marijuana, worth $55, to each recipient. The
shop has been open only three months, and though Wiegman admitted the
giveaway was in part a promotion, he said that wasn't the main
point.

Through the pot promotion, the dispensary hoped to draw attention to
collectives that overcharge and lack compassion, Wiegman said. He said there
are too many people in the industry looking to make a fast buck.

"I'm showing what true compassion is for this industry, for all the
patients that really need the medicine," he said. "I think collectives in
general have not done a good job of taking this professional; we are a
pharmacy, and we have medicines that are legal."
