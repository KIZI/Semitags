WASHINGTON Â— A Canadian company said Monday it will build an oil pipeline from Oklahoma to Texas after President Barack Obama blocked the larger Keystone XL pipeline from Canada.

Calgary-based TransCanada says the new project does not require presidential approval, since it does not cross a U.S. border. The shorter pipeline is expected to cost about $2.3 billion and be completed next year, the company said.

The Obama administration had suggested development of an Oklahoma-to-Texas line to alleviate an oil glut at a Cushing, Okla., storage hub.

Press secretary Jay Carney said Obama welcomed the announcement.

3. Ask Big Oil.

As for the US Gov't... I'd say because it lowers the trade deficit.
 
 
4. President Obama did not block Keystone XL pipeline...

... the citizens and state legislature of Nebraska did, forcing TransCanada to go around the Sandhills region to avoid poisoning the Ogallala aquifer. President Obama has declined to jump the gun and approve of Keystone XL as no valid plan that reflects the rerouting of the pipeline has been offered yet, let alone have they completed all the planning issues that go with it. So how can something be approved of if no plan has been submitted as of yet?
 
 
5. There are already eight pipelines out of Cushing, OK

So far no problems.
