Anti-war protesters have heckled former White House political adviser Karl Rove off the stage at his book signing in Beverly Hills.

About 100 Rove supporters watched Monday as Code Pink co-founder Jodie Evans walked toward him with handcuffs, calling him a war criminal and saying she was making a citizen's arrest.

Ten protesters in all repeatedly interrupted Rove's talk at the Saban Theatre as he promoted his memoir, "Courage and Consequence: My Life As a Conservative in the Fight."

Rove says the allegation that the Bush administration lied about weapons of mass destruction "is a pernicious political attack launched by cynical and hypocritical individuals."

There were no arrests.
