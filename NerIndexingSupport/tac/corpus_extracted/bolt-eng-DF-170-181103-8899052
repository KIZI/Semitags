Obama: I have it tougher than Abe Lincoln
Published: 4:07 PM 08/16/2011 | Updated: 12:41 AM 08/17/2011

President Barack Obama said yesterday in Decorah, Iowa, that he absorbs more political criticism than Abraham Lincoln, the assassinated 16th U.S. president, attracted from his Civil War critics.

The comment came during a question-and-answer session where one invited audience member asked Obama how he deals with his congressional critics in the GOP. The Congress doesnt seem to be a good partner. You said so yourself, theyre more interested in seeing you lose than [seeing] the country win, the questioner lamented.

Democracy is always a messy business in a big country like this, Obama responded. When you listen to what the federalists said about the anti-federalists  those guys were tough. Lincoln, they used to talk about him almost as bad as they talk about me.

The comparison is hysterical  that is really laughable in many respects, said Alvin Felzenberg, the author of a book on American presidents. You couldnt print things today they said about Lincoln. Felzenberg teaches at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, and was the chief spokesman for the 9/11 Commission...

You just can't look or sound more weak and pathetic then Barrack Obama. He has shown himself to be the most ego centric president ever~
 
 
 
I've been to the Lincoln Museum in Springfield. The cartoons drawn and articles written were unbelievable: Like nothing you'd see today.

 

yep. Could spend a good 4 hours there. Then go to the 'village,' another hour or so. The cemetery, really it could easily be an over night.

Yeah. I stopped there on my home from St. Louis. I think we were there about four hours. I definitely want to go back for the rest. I learned so much.
 
 
The man has hubris to the highest degree. Is it an wonder why he is an absolute failure as a leader?

Mr. Obama, I got some news for you, you have 90% of the press on your side. Go walk a mile in G.W. Bush's shoes, and you might just have something to whine about.

He claimed Words, pictures and comments were worse for him then Lincoln, what part of " you can not say the things they said back then" escapes you?

Further Lincoln eventually was KILLED by a Confederate sympathizer. Go ahead now and claim anyone will kill Obama.

Not knowing which side of the Fence you are on? Yes. have you read what our elected Officials have said about the Tea Party? They have called them murderers, terrorists, suicide Bombers, Nazis. SO yes I would expect such pap from a left winger, maybe next time but a smiley there if you mean it in jest.

Once again if you were a left winger you could easily have MEANT it. Or do I need to repeat they claim the Tea party are suicide bombers and terrorists? Claiming they were as much a threat as the Confederacy is no stretch from there. In fact I am surprised they haven't done so. I guess in a way they have as they also call them treasonous.

obama was serious. Now may his handlers get in there and say, 'For the love of god, don't be a doofus!'? Who knows.
 
 
The Left has compared Obama to Lincoln, FDR, JFK, and who knows what else.
The truth is he is comparable to Barack Obama. He is singular in his many failings of both character and policy. Jimmy Carter never whined like Obama, never blamed Nixon for all the problems he had.

The TEA Party isn't an actual party. It is a movement of ordinary citizens fed up with intrusive government and want it bound back to the Constitution. It's an ideal...same as the Sons Of Liberty in the 1700's, and the Founders.

So VP bite me and the rest of the Statists please go ahead and continue to call us terrorists and the like. It just furthers our resolve.

Obama needs to stop whining and grow up. He is no Lincoln, FDR, Reagan, JFK... he is simply Obama... The Statist.

Humans have a fundamental right of self protection. That s my view, in a thousand years the weapons we use today will be museum pieces at best.

What the issue is do you or dont you have the right to protect yourself.

After that is answerd i could say the right to bear arms wont mean much when technology advances beyond the firearm.

What good is a right to bear arms when nukes can be the size of a grapefruit.

To be honest i put more faith in my Point
Blank vest than any weapon i have.

My chances of shooting someone before they shoot me out in the streets isnt that good.

 

 

That didn't take long.
 
 
Lincoln was ridiculed by both the North and the South. He was looked at as a buffoon, ape, country bumpkin. Most thought he had no right to run the country. Obama faces strong political opposition and a 24/7 news network that opposes everything he does, but he is nowhere close to Lincolns abuse

Re the OP.

After civil war soldiers casualties rose to huge levels, Lincoln was widely denounced in the north as a butcher and murderer. Beyond the denunciations, Lincoln had a terrible time in office. His wife was borderline insane. His son died from typhus. Confederate armies came close to overruning washington twice while he was there - once from the north. He had to deal with some of the most incompetent military leadership the US ever had. He got to point where he couldn't stand living in the whitehouse, and moved to a nearby cottage on the grounds of a veterans home, using the whitehouse as just an office. At least three times during the war, he was threatened with anti-war insurrections in the north. There was an assasination attempt against him one time when he was riding to the veterans home, in which his famous stovepipe hat was shot off. Photographs over the course of the war show him ageing as if 20 years passed.

Obama trying to compare himself to Lincoln is disgusting on many levels.

President Obama's got it pretty tough. We aren't privvy to all the death threats he recieves but from what I understand, some kind of record has been broken.

Hes got it from Conservatives here and in Al Qaeda.

They would like nothing better then to see him dead.

What the issue is do you or dont you have the right to protect yourself.

After that is answerd i could say the right to bear arms wont mean much when technology advances beyond the firearm.

What good is a right to bear arms when nukes can be the size of a grapefruit.

To be honest i put more faith in my Point

My chances of shooting someone before they shoot me out in the streets isnt that good.

 

 

That didn't take long.

 

So. One persons viewpoint on a subject is everybody's viewpoint??

Don't think so.

From what I've read the shooter in the Giffords case is crazy. Hell. They can't even try him for his crimes because he's mentally incompetant.

The day you can figure out what goes on in the mind of a nutjob let me know. I'm sure phyciatrists across the world would love to get your insight.

Lincoln was ridiculed by both the North and the South. He was looked at as a buffoon, ape, country bumpkin. Most thought he had no right to run the country. Obama faces strong political opposition and a 24/7 news network that opposes everything he does, but he is nowhere close to Lincolns abuse

 

All President's face strong opposition - and rightly so. What they don't all do is whine like fucking 2 year olds about it. That seems to be a trait with this one particular President. More's the pity.

Rick Perry, just yesterday said that Bernake would be committing treason if he did his job and that President Obama doesn't love his country (shades of birthism).

Not only that..he basically threatened violence against Bernake...who isn't even a Democratic appointment. Rove spoke out against it..but only because Bernake was part of the Bushes.

And this? This is a serious Presidential candidate?

It's only an individual, if the individual is a liberal these days. It's the new standard - double standard.

"Don't do as we do, do as we say." is the new liberal mantra. They can accuse everyone of being terrorists, racists, Nazi's etc etc etc, but if anyone criticizes Obama.... well, we just 'hate' the 'black' guy and clearly want to kill him. See how that works? No? Nor do I but who the hell can follow the "intellect" of the new-left? It's fucking mindless drivel to anyone with an IQ over 10.

Obama: I have it tougher than Abe Lincoln
Published: 4:07 PM 08/16/2011 | Updated: 12:41 AM 08/17/2011

President Barack Obama said yesterday in Decorah, Iowa, that he absorbs more political criticism than Abraham Lincoln, the assassinated 16th U.S. president, attracted from his Civil War critics.

The comment came during a question-and-answer session where one invited audience member asked Obama how he deals with his congressional critics in the GOP. The Congress doesnt seem to be a good partner. You said so yourself, theyre more interested in seeing you lose than [seeing] the country win, the questioner lamented.

Democracy is always a messy business in a big country like this, Obama responded. When you listen to what the federalists said about the anti-federalists  those guys were tough. Lincoln, they used to talk about him almost as bad as they talk about me.

The comparison is hysterical  that is really laughable in many respects, said Alvin Felzenberg, the author of a book on American presidents. You couldnt print things today they said about Lincoln. Felzenberg teaches at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, and was the chief spokesman for the 9/11 Commission...

 

 

I hate to come to this douche bags defense.
but

Nothing has come out of HI for him to make any comparrison to, and since he learned polotics in The Land of Lincoln, that was probably the first person to come to mind.

Sadly though, even liberals think pols were nicer to each other back in the day but reality is far far different.

Lincoln got the most greif in history, imo. Obama doesn't crack the top 10, but he has no other person to make a comparrison too, except Jefferson or Carter.

Further Lincoln eventually was KILLED by a Confederate sympathizer. Go ahead now and claim anyone will kill Obama.

Conservatives here would relish taking out Obama. They tried to take out Giffords..with a surrogate prompted by Palin.

All Conservatives know is anger and violence.

They love killing people.

No. Your not crazy at all and most of the time I enjoy your posts even if I don't agree with em.

Politicians stick their foot in their mouths all the time. Look at Biden. Jesus that guys is sticking his foot in his mouth every time he opens it for Christs sakes and he's the VP. Perry stuck his in big time and he'll have to answer the LSM questions on it I'm sure.

Thats Perry's fight and I'm sure he'll come up with some spiffy answer. He's a politician after all and a darned good one at that.

Anyone who takes anything a politician says seriously 100% of the time is the crazy one in my book.

It's desperation time in the O camp.
 
 
Once again Obama does what he came to power to do... divide the country as much as fucking possible... Not to mention Obama tries to draw dramatic similarities between himself and all the "great" or popular presidents, it's fucking weird.

Who here says "I'm like so n so" when confronted with proof that you suck? I mean really, wtf is wrong with this man? Oh I know, he has never worked an honest day in his life, so any real work is exhausting.

It's like Bush building himself that library, only more awkward. If you're a great person you don't have to run around telling people to think you are, people should just pick up on it.
 
 
 
It's desperation time in the O camp.

 

No it's not, he/they are just trying to find something solid to stand on for 2012, having troubles yes but that's all they are doing... "Winning the future" didn't go over well. Desperation will come in the last few months before the GE, unless we get someone like Mitt, then it will be all "lolz" and "this is dumb" from the voters just like it was with McCain and Obama.

Voter responce: "No really, I said I'd vote for anyone over Obama... so why would I be happy my options are Mittbama or Obama?"

forget about what the press did with Lincoln, he got an amazing amount of abuse from his own generals. General Sherman routinely referred to him in conversation as the baboon.
 
 
There are lubricants that you can use during obama activity that will make you more slippery. These include K-Y Jelly and Astroglide.
There are also products you can use on a regular basis to eliminate vaginal dryness, such as Replens.
You can open vitamin E capsules and apply the oil inside your vagina daily for a week or two and then once or twice a week after that. If Obama still blames the Bush then see your doctor soon.

Thats all I have to say about that

 Obama Relieves McChrystal Over Critical Remarks, Names Petraeus as Replacement - FoxNews.com 
 
 
 
Mr. Obama, I got some news for you, you have 90% of the press on your side. Go walk a mile in G.W. Bush's shoes, and you might just have something to whine about.

 

Excellent point!  
 
 
 
 
 
Obama faces off with the Tea Party. Lincoln faced off with the Confederacy.

Which adversary is the greater dynamo?

 

He claimed Words, pictures and comments were worse for him then Lincoln, what part of " you can not say the things they said back then" escapes you?

Further Lincoln eventually was KILLED by a Confederate sympathizer. Go ahead now and claim anyone will kill Obama.

 

Are you kidding?

Conservatives here would relish taking out Obama. They tried to take out Giffords..with a surrogate prompted by Palin.

All Conservatives know is anger and violence.

They love killing people.

 

yOU ARE A lying PIECE OF shit. yOU HAVE MADE SPECIFIC CHARGES, provide EVIDENCE YOU FUCKING TURD.
 
 
 
 
 
  Hyperbolic lies. That's all "you people" have left, huh?  

 

it's like his own acid is eating him up..

 

It is rare that I actually laugh out loud when reading stuff on this forum, but I sure do at some of the complete hyperbole from Swallow. That is some funny shit. He definitely has a career in comedy. Scary thing is that I think he actually believes the garbage he writes.    

 

I reported his ass. Doubt anything is done but he made specific charges that are complete lies. If I have to link to every story I talk about then he needs to link to some evidence his lies are not lies.

Projection at its worst, for you libs look more like the

the Khmer Rouge every day and in every way.

 

 

What projection?

You fuckers were happy as clams to invade a country over nothing. You know how many people died as a result of Iraq? It's over 200,000. I've been on conservative blogs that show machine guns taking out Iraqis to the music of heavy metal.

You guys think it's a football game.

It's not. Real people died.

 

i haven't

you should seek help

Hate to break it to you you lying piece of scum, the Liberals voted for Iraq AND continue to this day supporting it. Including Barrack Obama.

What I find offensive is people like Jillian will defend your sorry ass and then claim the Republicans are bitter and angry.
 
 
 
Lincoln was ridiculed by both the North and the South. He was looked at as a buffoon, ape, country bumpkin. Most thought he had no right to run the country. Obama faces strong political opposition and a 24/7 news network that opposes everything he does, but he is nowhere close to Lincolns abuse

 

Gonna IGNORE Swallow and say nothing? Typical Liberal.

Humans have a fundamental right of self protection. That s my view, in a thousand years the weapons we use today will be museum pieces at best.

What the issue is do you or dont you have the right to protect yourself.

After that is answerd i could say the right to bear arms wont mean much when technology advances beyond the firearm.

What good is a right to bear arms when nukes can be the size of a grapefruit.

To be honest i put more faith in my Point
Blank vest than any weapon i have.

My chances of shooting someone before they shoot me out in the streets isnt that good.

 

 

That didn't take long.

 

So. One persons viewpoint on a subject is everybody's viewpoint??

Don't think so.

From what I've read the shooter in the Giffords case is crazy. Hell. They can't even try him for his crimes because he's mentally incompetant.

The day you can figure out what goes on in the mind of a nutjob let me know. I'm sure phyciatrists across the world would love to get your insight.

Just a dumb bunch of statements S.

 

The quote has no point, the guy was saying he WON"T be shooting anyone. I take it as he is to slow or a poor shot to have a chance with someone shooting at him. NOT him wanting to shoot anyone.

One persons?

Rick Perry, just yesterday said that Bernake would be committing treason if he did his job and that President Obama doesn't love his country (shades of birthism).

Not only that..he basically threatened violence against Bernake...who isn't even a Democratic appointment. Rove spoke out against it..but only because Bernake was part of the Bushes.

And this? This is a serious Presidential candidate?

And you call me crazy for pointing out the violent intent of Conservatives?

Oh gosh.

 

The only person being violent is you. Making ignorant lies about everyone, probably cause you were disappointed in Wisconsin and see the handwriting on the wall.

Obama AS PRESIDENT declared that returning veterans were a serious threat for terrorism and his Justice Department agreed.

The Justice Department ORDERED gun store owners to break the law and sell thousands of weapons to Mexican drug gangs. Obama's Justice Department. And what happened to the men responsible on the Ground? They were all promoted and sent to DC so the White House can keep an eye on them before they spill their guts.

The same Justice Department that KNEW they had ordered the sale of weapons to Mexican Drug gangs released reports on serial numbers claiming we had a problem in the SW with gun stores and gun shows illegally selling weapons to the Mexican drug gangs. Weapons they KNEW they had ordered sold.

And you don't care.

Giffords was shot by a whacko with no ties to any political movement, which you know full well since that claim was destroyed within days of it being made.

Your Liberal Senators and Congressman all voted FOR Iraq war. AND voted every year since to support it. Including Barrack Obama.

Not one single credible attempt has been made on Obama. NOT ONE. In fact as far as I know no one has been arrested except one nut job in the Midwest that opened his fat mouth just before an Obama visit. He had no means or ability to do anything as the Secret service discovered.

For 8 YEARS bush was threatened with death, being tried for war crimes, you name it he went through it. And you want to compare Obama to Lincoln? You are a LIAR and a fucking joke.

Giffords was spotlighted by Palin..and said so. Do you even bother to watch the clip? Same with Tiller being spotlighted by O'Reilly. You guys like to find proxies to do your dirty work. But sometimes you do it on your own, like with Tim McVeigh, Scott Rudolph, James Brunn and a whole host of others.

Bush went to war based on lies. And he fed those lies to congress. Be that as it may, no congress has ever denied a President a war..if they wanted one.

But Bush was under no danger of being tried for "War Crimes" ever. They can STILL try him. See any traction there? Bush had a pretty easy ride of it..until the last couple of years..when all the shit he pulled caught up with him.

Since day one, Obama's been under assault. He's gotten absolutely no slack and this thread even proves it. Every utterance, every move, everything this guy does and DOESN'T do is harshly attacked. Even casual associations are subject to massive conflations.

You piece of violent shit.

Clinton was impeached and disbarred because he lied under oath. Obama is inefectual and behaving ever more like a buffoon. Why bother with him. If he is reelected he will just spend more time on the golf course.

But not quite as difficult. Yes, really.

Yes, he said this.

Obama: I have it tougher than Abe Lincoln
Published: 4:07 PM 08/16/2011 | Updated: 12:41 AM 08/17/2011

President Barack Obama said yesterday in Decorah, Iowa, that he absorbs more political criticism than Abraham Lincoln, the assassinated 16th U.S. president, attracted from his Civil War critics.

The comment came during a question-and-answer session where one invited audience member asked Obama how he deals with his congressional critics in the GOP. The Congress doesnt seem to be a good partner. You said so yourself, theyre more interested in seeing you lose than [seeing] the country win, the questioner lamented.

Democracy is always a messy business in a big country like this, Obama responded. When you listen to what the federalists said about the anti-federalists  those guys were tough. Lincoln, they used to talk about him almost as bad as they talk about me.

The comparison is hysterical  that is really laughable in many respects, said Alvin Felzenberg, the author of a book on American presidents. You couldnt print things today they said about Lincoln. Felzenberg teaches at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, and was the chief spokesman for the 9/11 Commission...

Calm down what?

Yesterday Rick Perry had a field day. He called Bernake traitor. And threatened violence on him if he showed up in Texas. That's fucking amazing. This is after the guy flirted with Secession as an option for his state. You know what happened the last time some states tried to Secede? 600,000 Americans perished in one of the most bloody wars this country has ever seen.

Conservatives are constantly using violent imagery for things..and instead of being cowed when something goes terribly wrong..they come back with something worse.

And that..is ridiculous.

This very thread is making "fun" of a President who get 30 death threats a day. For an offhand comment. He's not spotlighting anyone. He's not calling people traitors or treasonous. He's reflecting how difficult it is to get anything done. It's true. This congress has put up under 50 bills. It's set to be the least productive in the history of the United States. This while we are facing what might be the worst financial crisis.

"I" look bad?

And let the insults fly.

 

You haven't posted any facts. In truth, I doubt you know what a fact looks like anymore, honey. You're just silly.... not funny, not clever.... actually, you're pretty much at the level of rdean and truthmatters. Harsh, but true.
 
 
 
 
 
Well feel free, lassie.

Crush me with facts.

Or go with your old stand by.

And let the insults fly.

 

You calling CG out on insults?
Do you see any irony in what you just posted?  

 

What irony?

I seldom start with insults..however..I don't back away once the shit starts a flying.

 

You've called me a racist, a terrorist, and a Nazi in recent days. You have no evidence, and you actually know that none of these are true. I've called you a fucking idiot.... for which I have a plethora of evidence.

Seems you have brought ALL of this on yourself with your posts.
Do you use a broad brush often? just sayin...

 

What?

Going after Obama for a comment while completely ignoring what Perry said..which given that there are NUTS out there more then willing to take pot shots at elected officials..was assinine to say the least, constitutes what?

Good stuff?

At what point do you fellows go..well..we better tamp this down a bit.

I don't mind holding up a mirror and pointing out violent ideology.

Better that then seeing Bernake's brains on the street because of some nut.
 
 
I think the stress of trying to defend the indefensible has got to sallow.

obama the destroyer now feeds on his own kind, political cannibalism

What the heck are you talking about?

You've talked about shooting people and made personal threats to me in this very thread.

You illustrate exactly what I am talking about.

None of your compatriots have chided you over either at all.

In fact one defended the shooting thing.

What? You mean someone behaved like you? Yea, I can see how that would be stupid. It's never wise to emulate stupid.

You've also accused me of wanting to put a bullet in your brain too.... a thought that had not entered my head - and still holds no appeal. So, basically, you make shit up and then get all outraged about it.

Reality - find it.

If thats true i should be banned poste haste

Butt, you slander once again, so lets see what the admin does.

what has been posted is public record.

And i will be copying everything fyi.
 
 
 
 
I know you guys have and will read into it what you want, and perhaps I'm doing the same, but I have a feeling that if we had a video of this it'd be plain to see the comment was meant as a joke.

could be wrong, doubt i am.

 

No, he was serious- It was his response to a question asked him from the crowd. The guy is the most ego centric; self absorbed; and arrogant president ever.

 

you're absolutely right. nobody has ever made a joke in response to a question from the crowd.

seriously - i'd be willing to bet the farm it was an attempt at humor, and unless someone has the video evidence to show otherwise, that's what i'm choosing to believe.
 
 
 
 
 
Obama faces off with the Tea Party. Lincoln faced off with the Confederacy.

Which adversary is the greater dynamo?

 

He claimed Words, pictures and comments were worse for him then Lincoln, what part of " you can not say the things they said back then" escapes you?

Further Lincoln eventually was KILLED by a Confederate sympathizer. Go ahead now and claim anyone will kill Obama.

 

Are you kidding?

Conservatives here would relish taking out Obama. They tried to take out Giffords..with a surrogate prompted by Palin.

All Conservatives know is anger and violence.

They love killing people.

 

You're out of your fucking mind

Obama: I have it tougher than Abe Lincoln
Published: 4:07 PM 08/16/2011 | Updated: 12:41 AM 08/17/2011

President Barack Obama said yesterday in Decorah, Iowa, that he absorbs more political criticism than Abraham Lincoln, the assassinated 16th U.S. president, attracted from his Civil War critics.

The comment came during a question-and-answer session where one invited audience member asked Obama how he deals with his congressional critics in the GOP. “The Congress doesn’t seem to be a good partner. You said so yourself, they’re more interested in seeing you lose than [seeing] the country win,” the questioner lamented.

“Democracy is always a messy business in a big country like this,” Obama responded. “When you listen to what the federalists said about the anti-federalists … those guys were tough. Lincoln, they used to talk about him almost as bad as they talk about me.”

The comparison “is hysterical … that is really laughable in many respects,” said Alvin Felzenberg, the author of a book on American presidents. “You couldn’t print things today they said about Lincoln.” Felzenberg teaches at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, and was the chief spokesman for the 9/11 Commission...

 

 

    So our cry-baby President THINKS he is receiving more criticism than Abe Lincoln--when the south was fighting the north.

You know this President must think ALL Americans are ignorant--   This guy can't get to Martha's Vineyard soon enough--that's how sorry I feel for him--while most Americans haven't been able to afford a vacation for years--because they haven't found a JOB.

Of course that's what you will choose to believe...like any well trained kool-aid drinker.

I saw the video clip on FOX in it's context- of course the Obama state run media won't play it because then they'd have to make public excuses for him... this way like you they are free to just pretend it was a joke or maybe it never even happened...yeah~

You have got to be kidding me. I knew Obama had an Ego but Jesus lol. This has to be a joke right. He thinks he has it as bad as a president who's election was the Spark that caused half the Union to leave it, and a war that killed over half a million Americans to happen?

OMG dude, Obama needs medication. This is Delusional. Other than FOX the other networks have given Obama a Pass time and time again. Hell if they had even done their jobs and reported everything about Obama, He probably would not have been elected. Talk about a persecution Complex. We have a very sick individual Running this country.

Obama also issued new guidelines to ensure humane and lawful treatment of suspects deemed too dangerous to release, but officials insisted he was still determined to shutter the controversial "war on terror" facility in Cuba.They said the president still maintained that some suspects could be tried in federal courts, despite fierce opposition and blocking tactics from a bi-partisan front in Congress.
