The New York Times reported Monday night that Connecticut Attorney General
Richard Blumenthal has claimed numerous times that he served in Vietnam, even
though he obtained at least five military deferments and avoided ever going to
war.

Blumenthal (D) is a candidate for the U.S. Senate seat now held by Christopher
Dodd (D), and he has held a commanding lead in the race since he entered it. But
the Times report has the potential to fundamentally reshape the contest in the
Nutmeg State.

His campaign manager, Mindy Myers, called the article "an outrageous distortion
of Dick Blumenthal's record of service." She noted his six years of service in
the Marine Corps Reserve and said he "received no special treatment from
anyone."

The Times reported that Blumenthal obtained deferments from 1965 to 1970, then
joined the Marine Reserve in 1970 and was based in Washington through the end of
the war. The newspaper said that the deferments allowed him to finish a degree
at Harvard and serve as an assistant to The Washington Post's publisher,
Katharine Graham.

Blumenthal told the Times on Monday that he misspoke about his service at a 2008
event and might have misspoken at other times. "My intention has always been to
be completely clear and accurate and straightforward, out of respect to the
veterans who served in Vietnam," he said.

Eric Schultz, communications director for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee, blamed Republicans for the report. In particular, he pointed at
former World Wrestling Entertainment executive Linda McMahon, one of several
Republicans running for the seat.

"It's no surprise Republicans would want to smear Dick Blumenthal," Schultz
said.

Ed Patru, a spokesman for McMahon, responded, "It's become increasingly clear to
us over the past weeks and months, as we've researched Mr. Blumenthal, that
there are some very troubling discrepancies between what he's been saying and
the truth."

Blumenthal has served as the state's top cop since 1988, and national Democrats
spent months ensuring that he was ready to run if and when Dodd decided not to
seek re-election.

When Blumenthal entered the race, his poll numbers were stratospheric: He held
massive leads over McMahon and Rob Simmons, a former congressman. Even as
Democrats celebrated, however, some warned that Blumenthal had not been tested
in a serious campaign in more than two decades and that once punched _ as he
inevitably would be in a high-profile race like this one _ he would collapse.

"He's popular, but for no particular reason," said one senior Democratic
strategist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid. "No one really
knows him, and this fills in the blanks in a pretty devastating way."

The strategist added that Connecticut remains strongly Democratic, but he
acknowledged, "It's a race now."

Blumenthal faces only nominal primary opposition, although the state's filing
deadline isn't for another week.
