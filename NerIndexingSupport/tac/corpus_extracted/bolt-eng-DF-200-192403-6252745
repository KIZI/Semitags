so ive been talking to this guy for a while and we've been flirting back and forth and he recently asked me out on a date and pretty much everything went perfectly and he even asked for a second date which was supposed to happen on friday.

Hes going away tomorrow to thailand for a month (alone) and when i texted him on thursday to confirm our plans he said that he couldnt make it cause he hasnt packed and he hasnt got everything together for his holiday, he also added that he feels really bad about it but that he'd send me a postcard when hes there.

everything has been pretty good up until that last converstion, we havent spoken since and hes leaving tomorrow. i have NO clue whatsoever if he even remotely likes me back and i was thinking if it was wise if i sent him a text with something along the lines of 'hope u have a good time blah blah'? what does everyone think?

Need some TSR advice! please xx
 
 
Show him your chest.

lol yeah that would probably be an extremely effective way of getting his attention but hes going away tomorrow! there isnt even time to do that!
 
 
call him once or twice on his trip. if you do like him then the cost shouldn't matter

yeah was thinking maybe keep in touch with him once or twice but would that make me look needy (i have deep seeded insecurities)? also i wouldnt be able to call him as hes only taking his mobile and the charges wouldnt be on him (roaming). i was thinking either fb message or email?

give him a text before he goes. if he's kind of a player then he might think you're needy but otherwise he would definitely like it. try and call him at the place(/s) he's staying instead. If that wouldn't work then give him an email or whatever.

i'm a guy and would like a call/email from anyone (even if i didn't like them) so go for it. If he replies then don't give a long reply back but perhaps just some natural questions (maybe keep the conversation to a couple of messages). hope you get him. good luck

either that was the best advice ever or you just told me exactly what i want to hear. either way THANKS MAYN! ill drop him a simple text tonight and and email in about two weeks-ish. and im not the kind to write long messages never know what to say! HA xx

hope you get him   ( you probably will because you seem nice). most guys don't really focus on looks much (obviously you can't be super duper unattractive for MOST guys to like you)and personality is a huge thing.  
 
 
It depends how you want to play it.. but personally i don't think its the right time to question whether he likes you or not because relationships are all about timing. He goes away for a month which isn't really that long, and you made the effort by asking to confirm if you were still going on a second date. So now i think that really its his turn to make the effort with you if he likes you.. particularly as as your a girl you don't want to appear too available. I think the best thing for you to do is just keep yourself busy and get on with your life for the next month and when he gets back he will contact you if he wants to see you or if hes worth it. And if he doesn't, you'll have been so busy the past month that you won't care as much if he doesn't! So make sure you dont obsess about it all month because he's going to be busy in thailand and won't think about it as much as you.. not because he doesn't like you, but if you were in thailand you definitly would be busy making the most out of it rather than thinking about a guy.. Just go with the flow   thats my advice! If a guy likes you, he'll make it happen

yup i think i agree with this too. sort of decided to do it this way late last night. i did however send him the text wishing him well on his trip and got no reply. obvs it isnt worth it if he comes back and doesnt give two ****s to drop me a text. got lots to be busy with over the next few weeks anyways. frehsers week (my last one-final year student) and other miscellaneuos things! thanks for the advice xx
 
 
Yeah, I think you did the right thing by wishing him a nice time because if you didn't you would of wondered what would of happened if you did.. he might of been busy packing and sorting things out for his trip, but don't obsess about it or analyse it.. Don't EXPECT to hear from him because that way you won't be dissapointed   so nows the time to get on with your life and keep yourself busy.. You've shown that your interested without being too keen, so now's his turn to make an effort. If he doesn't its totally his loss! No worries   hope its helped xx
