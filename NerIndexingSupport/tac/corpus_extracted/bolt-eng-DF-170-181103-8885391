RNC-still member,attended the 2004 convention in NYC as a delegate for the state of delaware.
if anyones read my posts,im a breakaway,and dont toe the partyline. I belive in true leadership,representing government of the people,by the people,for the peopke,as anyone whos gotten to read my proposals can see maybe im extreme but the proposals i make are needed to bring us back to the glory of BEING THE BEST nation in the world.

i know my proposals work,i need the backing and people support to make it happen. Unlike alot of people from either parties,im very transparant,and stick to my core values,and constantly grow and evolve as the individual i am. An ordinary amerucan,but,passionate,and proud.
 
 
Im also an integral part of that pajamahedeen that discovered the bush docs were faked,plus being a certified IT specialist,i also can certify that the birth doc obama offered was a FRAUD.
 
 
I also started and founded the FOUNDATION NATIONAL REFORM PARTY(symbol-lion)in 2003,reviving that too,while,still being a conservative grassroots activist,not toeing ANYLINE at all.
 
 
Im also a musician,and can play 19 different instruments,and a graphic designer too.
 
 
Most important of all,im not an armchair.
i am making a difference.
i have proposals to eliminate government imposed redistributive taxation.
Reverse and eliminate wilsonian and FDR progessive programs like SSA and eliminate the general fund and evolve the system to citizen future investment accounts handled electively by each citizen held by the US treasury.
eliminate all foreign aid and spending.
eliminate all entitlements and invoke a cando profitable capitalist evironment for all us citizens.
eliminate illegal immigration,as well as the excuse and dependence for such by businessess.
rollback professional redistributive programs like affirmative action,where only MERIT and QUALIFICATIONS count in getting ajob.
 
 
Responsibility and control of all levels of government jurisdiction will be back in the hands of the majority vote of the people,and elected officials will only be able to act,transparantly,in a manner as to perform in such manner only,and not unto themselves. Budgetary profitability is returned directly back to the citizen government investor at each and every level of government jurisdiction.
 
 
Make it so that all socialistic communist divisioning is totalky eliminated,and that,native born,or legally naturalized,we represent ourselves,individually,equal,as AMERICAN CITIZENS.
 
 
Citizen government investor=formerly known as slave taxpayer.
 
 
Turns out the majority is for Obama- despite a tidal wave of Pub propaganda, but good luck. Sorry about the Pub cutbacks on do nothing government workers like cops...
 
 
Check again. Other polls show potentially crushing defeat,but i think as an ordinary american i can do better than all.
 
 
Complete elimination of the entitlement society,restore the responsible society.
 
 
Ill probably support the Republican incumbant in 2016, unless this nation is in serious danger by whomever that is. Which i doubt.
 
 
Read what im all about. Responsible immigration,checking background,affiliations,disease check,and make sure all citizen applicants have at least a high school education,and can read,write,and speak functional english.RESTORE AND ESTABLISH ENGLISH AS THE NATIONAL LANGUAGE.

Ill be doing that this turnaround,but i feel i can do better.
 
 
Im a conservative constitutional evolutionist.
 
 
We need strong threat deterrance,internally,and externally.
 
 
It's not an entitlement society, it's the SECOND Pub Great Depression....
 
 
It is entitlement society,thats why druggies and drunks and obese,all self inflicted prpblems,line up by the droves,trying to get SSI clsiming inability to work. Thats an entitlement society. A handout supportvstolen from someone and redistributed to those who dont earn it
 
 
See sig. Cheers
 
 
Havent refuted anything i proposed.oh well.
 
 
 
Im a conservative constitutional evolutionist.

 

How the heck are you that?
 
 
Conservative values,believe in governing via the constitution,and evolving out of the situation we are in now.
 
 
Bump for me. Read my bio and qualifications. This is the greatest country in the world,and we can make a change.
 
 
Time to make things right and change.
 
 
As an ordinary american,if i had the support and backing,i could easily outdebate and outaccomplish with my plans and proposals,the ones picked to run.
 
 
Bump for me.
 
 
Bump. I can still make a difference.
 
 
Anyone can make a difference, but I know I wont support you for President. I doubt many people around here would.

If you really want to be President, Id advice you to start locally. Reform your own life. Help your family and neighbors. Work hard in your business and in serving the community. Work on your writing and speaking skills. Learn how to persuade people.

And let me ask you one thing, Why do you want to be President?
 
 
I have reformed my own life,ages ago,my systems will work and can work at any level of government. Theyre designed that way.
 
 
Economically,i employ the same prioritization as i do in our household.no frills.
 
 
I think you'd make a great president. You seem sane, reasonable, intelligent, and very articulate...
 
 
And your grasp of the English language is mesmerizing...

You were raised in Bucks County, PA and you ended up in GEORGIA?!  

My sincerest sympathies, dude.
 
 
Georgia is great. I ended up here from holyoke,ma,which was a horrible gang infested ghetto.had enough of the liberal high expense of the north.and support for horrible programs,values,etc...
 
 
I love GEORGIA!!!!!
 
 
Run for school board; join the farm team, work your way up. that's how it's done.
Good luck!
 
 
Thank you!!!!i am working my way up,problem is,the leadership here is GOOD in GA and if its not broken,dont fix it...
 
 
They reflect the same values i have.
 
 
Work your way up.

Run for office at the local level, state level then maybe just maybe 20 years from now you could run for president. Build a real record for making jobs and a belief system that people can look at and agree with.

I'd run for a office that has to do with the job as president. May I suggest Mayor to start out with??? Senators or Congressmen don't make very good presidents. Once you have a record then run for Governor...
 
 
Wow, crazy old Ed Spacer. I haven't seen you in years. I figured you were locked up in the loony bin somewhere. You seem to like posting in your own threads about as much as Mal does. Well, maybe not AS much, but close.

Read my posts,though. Im not an armchair.now,i am making a difference.
