Crowds in a busy market fled in terror as a woman walked among them holding aloft the severed head of a man who had attacked her.

Covered in blood, she held the head high like a trophy, said police - her way of showing that she had delivered her own kind of justice to her attacker.

The gruesome scene was played out in Makkapurva village, 170 miles south east of the Indian city of Lucknow, where, last night, the woman was being held behind bars.

According to police officer Ram Bharose, the unnamed 35-year-old woman had sliced off the man's head with a sickle she had been using to cut grass near her village.

'She was getting grass for her cattle when the man came up from behind her and tried to sexually assault her,' said Mr Bharose.

'In a bid to save her dignity, she turned on him and during a struggle managed to chop off his head with the sickle.

'We have no doubts about her story because she had bite marks on her neck and cheek when the man tried to take advantage of her sexually.'

So determined was the woman to show that she had beaten off her attacker, who she claimed had been stalking her for three months, that she decided to take his head immediately to the local market.

'She put the head on parade,' said Mr Bharose. 'She walked right through all the crowds who were buying their vegetables, holding the head up high.

'All her clothes were covered in blood, but as far as she was concerned that didn't matter. She just wanted to make a point and she definitely succeeded in doing that.

'Everybody scattered. It was a very terrifying sight.' Mr Bharose said the woman had no regrets about her actions.

'We have to follow the letter of the law and although she says she acted in self defence she will probably be charged with culpable homicide,' said the police officer.

Yikes
 
 
Oh my good Lord!
 
 
I guess he ended up giving head to her instead of the other way around
 
 
south Asia is mad :O
I remember a couple weeks back a lady cut a rapists penis off lol.

Don't mess with these women! :O

Btw what kind of guy attacks a lady with a sickle!?
Surely you'd get rid of that first...

Ahh well sucks to be him and her  
 
 
Puts into perspective the grumbles we have in this country about having a lack of faith in our justice system.
 
 
Do you reckon he got his?
 
 
Shes heading to jail now

Yeah, but apparently that lady already reported him months before, dunno about this one   Creepy though.
 
 
I'll probably get lots of negative ratings for saying this, but I think this is brilliant.

I can tell you didn't read the story  

She was cutting grass with the sickle when he tried to rape her.
 
 
She 'managed to chop his head off with a sicle'. WTF. You know how hard it is to chop someones head off. He wouldve had to be still and she would have had to swung it really hard. She's a lying bitch crying rape, thats what she is.
 
 
Damn. Shame she'll spend her life in prison, though.
 
 
There was once this little boy init. And he was berr bored, so he told everybody he was raped by a wolf and everyone came runnin and chopped the wolfs head off with a sickle. The next day the boy was bored again so he told the same story and another wolf got merked. So now the wolves are pissed off right. So one day the boy was walking home from school. And a wolf raped him. The boy cried for help, but nobody came (except the wolf   )
 
 
 
I can tell you didn't read the story

you misinterpreted him, he meant the lady had a sickle, not the man in possession of it
 
 
I like a challenge.
 
 
 
I can tell you didn't read the story  

She was cutting grass with the sickle when he tried to rape her.

 

I did read it lol. I'm saying he must have known she was cutting grass with a sickle being a stalker and all lol
Why would he not get rid of it when he attacked rather then let her keep it lol

 
Yeah, but apparently that lady already reported him months before, dunno about this one   Creepy though.

 

Oh yeah. Tbf fair play to the Bengali woman. At least she didn't kill the guy and he was doing wrong anyway so deserved it.
However there were stories that they were both supposed to run away together but he didn't wana lol. Scary stuff :O

And this was just weird. Why take it to a market?

LOL classic
 
 
gruesome yet one off. real issue here is rape.
 
 
Yikes. WTF lol
 
 
Tbh it takes a certain amount of force and intent to chop someone's head off. Id understand if the body was found with a deep gash wound in the neck, but the fact that she cut off his head makes it fishy imo.

I wouldn't pass judgment too quickly..

Depends on the sickle really. If its sharp enough it could go through fairly easily.
 
 
Cool.
 
 
LOL LOL LOL. What kinda fool tries to bite and rape someone with a ****ing SCYTHE
 
 
BOOM

how amusing
 
 
I'd imagine she subdued him (maybe caught him in the neck with it?) with the sickle before beheading him as opposed to chopping it clean off with one swing in the height of a struggle  
 
 
Seems fishy to me. Cutting someone's head of is not easy. I find it hard to believe that a woman in such a state if agitation would have cleanly decapitated a man with a piece of farm equiptment.
 
 
 
 
 
I wonder how many of us, given the opportunity, would kill a rapist or wannabe rapist. And if we didn't kill them, if it was because we didn't want to serve time or because we actually thought it was the wrong thing to do/whether it really was that difficult to kill another human being no matter how much we hated them and thought they did deserve to die.
 
 
wanna see pics
 
 
I rate her.
 
 
Congrats to her
 
 
This isn't a current affair, that piece of news is over 2 years old.

Still, describing her as a bit loopy would be an understatement.
 
 
lol sickle knife. 1st thought was CoD zombies.
 
 
Nice job  

She should not be punished. It is a sad testament to the warped sense of modern justice, that we penalise people for killing thugs.
 
 
 
I rate her.

 

You rate her?. What excellent terminology. I don't think she needs your magic ratings.
 
 
good on her.... seriously, he deserved that!!
 
 
No picture ?  
 
 
its better to cut his head of then leave him walking around malesting others

Them sickles are extremely sharp, made for cutting through crops quickly. Seeing as she worked on the farm I'm assuming she wasn't a weakling, and a strong swing may have possibly cut his head clean off.

Surely it's better to incarcerate him than to murder him, if that's the case?
 
 
Well done to her. Sends out a clear message to any potential rapists that some women will fight back and it's not worth losing your life over.
 
 
He didn't use his head so that's why he lost it!  
 
 
 
I don't think anyone deserves to have their life taken from them... Their balls maybe, but not their life.

 

People who have been raped could argue that their life has been taken away from them as an experience like that can ruin you emotionally.

Edit: I was going to continue but then it could get into a whole other arguement, which I don't want

Edit #2: thanks for the neg

Maybe. But equally, how likely is it she got a clean chop to the neck of an assailant who attacked her from behind? Even had she managed to get away from him and swing, in that state of mind, a clean cut to the neck? Seems a little fishy, it could be true, but ehh...

Yes, but you still have a life which you build back together. With your head gone? Nothing to build on there.

Thanks, you too! I did explain why I gave you the neg rep though. I don't think murder is right.
 
 
 
'We have to follow the letter of the law and although she says she acted in self defence she will probably be charged with culpable homicide,' said the police officer.
 

Is this some sort of joke?

What they're basically saying is that she should have allowed him to rape her and then went through the correct means and reported him to the police after being unwillingly raped. Well done to you, inept police force, what a lovely message you're sending out there. 'Dont defend yourself whilst being raped, just take it and deal with it after'. Honestly, I hate all this judicial nonsense. She was defending herself from a vicious and callous person.

Its this sort of idiocy that leads to rapists like that evil, sick and twisted man thinking they can keep doing it and getting away with it.

Not this time mate, you've been well and truly served and this woman was rightfully defending herself. Had he not tried to rape her, she wouldn't have had to cut his head off would she. He deserved it.

To be honest, if this was in the UK and this woman was being prosecuted, I wouldn't hesitate in starting a petition demanding her release.
 
 
 
You rate her?. What excellent terminology. I don't think she needs your magic ratings.

 

LOOOOL calm down dude, i think it was good she did that, better than the rapist actually raping her and her allowing him to, plus he'd go around and rape even more people.
 
 
Sickles used by asian farmers are generally very sharp and bear in mind that she uses it regulary so would have a decent technique and strength would have built up over decades of usage. I don't think it's that unlikely she would have been able to chop his head off.
 
 
 
Yes, but you still have a life which you build back together. With your head gone? Nothing to build on there.

why should he live? live to rape another woman??! To be honest I wouldn't even think twice about killing someone if I could if they had raped me/were in the process of raping me.

I don't think rape is right and I think his punishment is quite fitting, even better that it came from his victim.

To be fair, I think the problem lies in the fact that she severed his head and then went around displaying it for the public to see rather than going straight to the police. She seems pretty unstable herself and potentially dangerous as well.
 
 
I don't think it says anywhere what a lot of people are assuming, that she just chopped his head off in one swing during a fight. It's entirely possible he passed out/died from wounds first and was then decapitated. Which would make it indefensible use of force, tbh, but at the same time it's really hard to care.
 
 
shes a legend. fair play to her  
 
 
 
I don't think anyone deserves to have their life taken from them... Their balls maybe, but not their life.

 

I wouldn't wish that on anybody.
 
 
 
I wouldn't wish that on anybody.

 

Please tell me where I said I would wish that on someone? I meant if someone rapes a woman and they got their balls chopped off then it wouldn't exactly be undeserved.

well yes but if it was like an adrenaline rush you wouldnt think twice!
 
 
Any pictures or what?

What have you been up to, to know that?
 
 
Either she has mental health issues or she was in some serious shock. Who would walk through a market swinging a head? (And doesn't this remind you of that bloke a couple of weeks back?)

If she was suffering from either of these conditions then she shouldn't be punished. If somebody was going to force themselves upon you, it's inevitable that you react. She had a weapon in her grasp and it's inevitable that she used it. It's amazing what a person can do when provoked.
 
 
Whilst I don't agree that killing the attacker was the right way to go about it, I hope this sends a clear message to would be rapists that not all women will accept being abused and some may fight back. Hard.

Not really to be honest.

I suspect she was just wanted to show the rest of the town what a sick bastard this man was and rightfully so. She had full right to show him up for the sick and twisted man he was. Now everyone at his funeral will know he was a rapist.

The only reason she comes across as dangerous is because she was forced to defend herself by this man. Had he not interfered in her life and attacked her then she wouldn't have been made to defend herself. Its human nature to defend yourself when being attacked. Its his own fault.

You may not agree with me, but as I know a friend who's been through a rape ordeal, I regard it as bad as murder. Basically, it can take years and years to get your life back together. The person in question tried to kill herself as well because of it and is still not back to how she was now.

After seeing such a close friends life completely crushed by such a thing, I have no sympathy whatsoever for sick and vile rapists. There is no place for them on Earth in a civilised world.

To me, if she is prosecuted, then that is pathetic. He's a sick man and he had it coming.
 
 
To actually sever someones head with a sickle would be very difficult, I imagine that there is more to the story than is said.

Yeah, but by carrying some guy's severed head around, isn't that traumatizing others as well? I feel it is VERY unfair on the general public too. For example, if I a little kid saw that... That pretty much ruins a childhood. Obviously he is a twisted f*ck but what she did is definitely worrying about her mental state as well.

I'm not defending the rapist btw, I just don't think she could have handled the situation any worse after having killed the guy.

Okay, maybe she should be charged with public indecency or inflicting trauma on others or a charge along those lines but homicide? thats ridiculous. She killed him in self defence.

To be honest, after almost being bitten, attacked and almost raped, I'd say its fair to assume for a period after that whilst no one would be in the right frame of mind. Crimes like rape whether they're carried out or not can screw up your mental state completely.

I think she should be assessed, maybe held in a hospital for a whilst while doctors monitor her state and wellbeing and if she's is judged to be fine then she should be let go. I don't think she should be charged for homicide. If this guy never tried to rape her she would still be fine and probably continuing on with her day to day life. His sick and vile actions drove her to it.
 
 
 
This isn't a current affair, that piece of news is over 2 years old.

Still, describing her as a bit loopy would be an understatement.

 

Hmm.. loopy for defending herself against a rapist. Sure.

 
Surely it's better to incarcerate him than to murder him, if that's the case?

 

Yeah. Of course. She should have let him rape her, and then gone to the police, reported it, and hoped than an inept police force in a country where women's rights don't really matter would have caught him, and locked him up for long enough to prevent any further attacks and for him to be fully rehabilitated. /sarcasm

If I had a sickle in my hands and someone tried to rape me, I think i'd do exactly the same, or try to.

Killing the guy in SELF-DEFENSE in fine, that part is not.
 
 
Why is it only guys who are disagreeing with the womans actions?
 
 
rather his head than mine!
 
 
 
rather his head than mine!

 

well don't rape anyone, and your head is safe  
 
 
 
you've changed your tune.

 

A *little* bit, having thought about it since it was self-defense.
 
 
 
Depends on the sickle really. If its sharp enough it could go through fairly easily.

 

Makes more sense to first kill him and then cut the head off.  
 
 
 
A *little* bit, having thought about it since I suppose it was self-defense.

 

 
 
 
 
She 'managed to chop his head off with a sicle'. WTF. You know how hard it is to chop someones head off. He wouldve had to be still and she would have had to swung it really hard. She's a lying bitch crying rape, thats what she is.

 

didn't you know? if a woman calls rape you are not allowed to question it especially if you are a man, didn't you know this?
 
 
This was in 2008, what the hell were you Googlin' to find this? That is a whole new level of niche porn!
 
 
There's also that story of the women in Bangledesh ( I think) who cut off a guy's penis because he tried to rape her, but he claimed that she was the one who constantly came on to him and she became angry because he always rejected her. Hmmm....

This story sounds fishy too.
 
 
 
well don't rape anyone, and your head is safe  

 

Thanks. i don't ever intend to rape /sexually assault anyone anyways
 
 
 
there was once this little boy init. And he was berr bored, so he told everybody he was raped by a wolf and everyone came runnin and chopped the wolfs head off with a sickle. The next day the boy was bored again so he told the same story and another wolf got merked. So now the wolves are pissed off right. So one day the boy was walking home from school. And a wolf raped him. The boy cried for help, but nobody came (except the wolf   )

 

pahahahahaha  
 
 
The way Britain is headed, it wont be long before we see this behaviour in Slough or Luton.
 
 
 
Puts into perspective the grumbles we have in this country about having a lack of faith in our justice system.

 

But no justice system can be expected to stop a woman alone in the middle of a field from being raped. If that happened in the UK, the police wouldn't be able to stop it. They may well be able to apprehend him afterwards, but the Indian police might have been able to do that too.

hahaha.... if the blokes story is true, it begs the question of how the woman managed to get his willy out, presumably the male would be stronger than the female and in a position to get her off him

Ah. Well knowing your morality this must be the perfect moral action yo

I was referring more to the fact that the woman in question, fearing rape, had so little faith in the justice system that she took matters into her own hands (i.e. she didn't believe he would be caught and punished for the attempt).

She could have prevented him from raping her without murdering him. She had a sickle, that wouldn't have been too hard. After he has been incapacitated, she can alert the police and he will be arrested and charged with attempted rape. Murder is not necessary, nor would she need to be raped for him to be imprisoned.
 
 
Serves him right I suppose, she shouldn't have chopped his head off but it wouldn't've happened if he hadn't attacked her.
 
 
he got what he deserved.. she shouldn't be punished harshly for this.
 
 
 
Because you can throw children down mine shafts for the lulz?

 

Well that is against the law, but if it wasn't maybe I would!

Only if it gave me pleasure of course, I have better use for children, like creating a mini ninja army.

Okay, I will admit, it must have been scary to see her. But it does send a clear and valuable message to potential rapists. Moreover, after just having a man attempt to rape her and cutting his head off, she was most likely in a great deal of shock.

In India, on average rapists - people who actually commit rape - usually serve three to four years imprisonment for it. I couldn't find any stats on attempted rape, but it's likely to be a lot less.
That's if they catch him, which they probably won't.
And if the police take it seriously, which they probably won't.
And if he isn't convincing enough to lie and make it look like her fault.
And if he doesn't have a good enough lawyer to get him off.

So, he spends what, a year in jail, if the woman is really lucky.
After a year, he seeks revenge, goes and kills her?
Or he rapes another woman who isn't armed with a sickle?
Or he rapes a hundred women, who knows.
What we do know is that such little jail time is extremely unlikely to rehabilitate anyone, and that is if he does go to jail, which is very far from certain.

The man tried to rape a woman. Rape isn't just sex that you don't like, it's one of the most violent and intrusive crimes known to humanity. He deserves what he gets, and society is much, much better off with him dead.
 
 
 
I was referring more to the fact that the woman in question, once raped, had so little faith in the justice system that she took matters into her own hands.

 

But she chopped the guy's head off before he had chance to rape her.  
 
 
Something similar happened in Bangladesh recently (the one where the woman chopped the rapist's penis off)
 
 
No one will try sexually assaulting her again
 
 
and the moral is:

don't mess with asian women! (especially ones who are cutting grass with sickles...)
 
 
 
But she chopped the guy's head off before he had chance to rape her.  

 

Verbal diarrhoea.  

Substitute "fearing rape" for "once raped".
 
 
Bit concerned at the number of people who claim to know how hard it is to chop someone's head off...  
 
 
Is it wrong that I want pics.... ?

Hey I've had my share of experience and I can tell you that it's extremely hard and requires years of experience depending on the weapon of use a sickle especially is a complicated device.
 
 
Disproportionate much?
 
 
Interesting with quite a few comments that aprove of vigilantism. Tbh I'd give her a civilian honour. That said, is this because it's rape, or would those approving of this behaviour would also advocate burglars being shot etc.? I'm not belittling the heinous nature of rape here but I'm interested in how far people advocate vigilantism.

If the police are able to look at her after she has killed him and say "Yes, it's clear he has tried to rape her, look at the marks on her neck and body" then they are just as able to do that with him alive.

The man tried to rape a woman. Rape isn't just sex that you don't like, it's one of the most violent and intrusive crimes known to humanity. He deserves what he gets, and society is much, much better off with him dead.
 

Okay, there is clearly a problem with rape in this society. However, I don't believe that murdering the rapists is the way to deal with this. It ignores the root of the problem; that they are able to do this in the first place. If there is a problem with short prison sentences, and reoffending, then these are what need to be tackled. Longer sentences could be implemented, and if this doesn't work, castration. Killing the offenders can only ever be a last resort, if all other attempts to improve the justice system fail.

Admittedly this is all of very little help to the woman as it is actually happening; I think very few people would argue that she was absolutely wrong to kill that man, if, in the heat of the moment, it was all she could think of to stop him raping her.
 
 
How the feck is that culpable homicide? It's manslaughter at worst? Just because she paraded the head around, it was still self defense? It's not like he changed his mind, ran away and she hunted him down. He maintained his advance despite her fighting back.
 
 
I think you can say that he

*Puts on sunglasses*

Head it coming

YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH

I don't think manslaughter exists in India; Culpable Homicide not Amounting to Murder would appear to be roughly the equivalent

That makes sense. Even still, I doubt you'd be charged with as much as that in the UK, she did what was necessary, he may have been planning to kill her. Her bizarre reaction could be put down to the stress of the attack itself.
 
 
it's an article from the daily mail? I mean really, do you believe half the stuff in it? :/ x
 
 
 
If the police are able to look at her after she has killed him and say &quot;Yes, it's clear he has tried to rape her, look at the marks on her neck and body&quot; then they are just as able to do that with him alive.

 

You ignored most of the points in that paragraph.

They probably won't catch him.
He's likely to say "We were lovers, she enjoyed rough sex, i tried to call it off, she's tried to accuse me of rape" or something like that. Due to the bias being much towards men's rights in Indian society, this gives him very little chance of being prosecuted.
If he can afford a good lawyer, which she may not - being a farmer - then it's likely that the lawyer will manage to turn the jury/judge against the victim by whatever means necessary. Lack of funds would lead to a lack of justice.

Like you said, the second paragraph is normative and applicable to wider society - not the woman's actions. I am in no way condoning the routine killing of all rapists, but I defend her right to kill him in order to defend herself wholeheartedly.

Actually I was assuming the situation was as I had left it in my previous post; she is able to get the police to the field where she is, immediately after the rape has taken place, with him lying unconscious on the floor.
 
 
 
She 'managed to chop his head off with a sicle'. WTF. You know how hard it is to chop someones head off. He wouldve had to be still and she would have had to swung it really hard. She's a lying bitch crying rape, thats what she is.

 

Brah do one your raps innit fam.
 
 
wow
 
 
 
Okay, I will admit, it must have been scary to see her. But it does send a clear and valuable message to potential rapists. Moreover, after just having a man attempt to rape her and cutting his head off, she was most likely in a great deal of shock.

In India, on average rapists - people who actually commit rape - usually serve three to four years imprisonment for it. I couldn't find any stats on attempted rape, but it's likely to be a lot less.
That's if they catch him, which they probably won't.
And if the police take it seriously, which they probably won't.
And if he isn't convincing enough to lie and make it look like her fault.
And if he doesn't have a good enough lawyer to get him off.

So, he spends what, a year in jail, if the woman is really lucky.
After a year, he seeks revenge, goes and kills her?
Or he rapes another woman who isn't armed with a sickle?
Or he rapes a hundred women, who knows.
What we do know is that such little jail time is extremely unlikely to rehabilitate anyone, and that is if he does go to jail, which is very far from certain.

probly knocked him out with a sickle and finished the job while he was lying on the floor...Painful

You do realize that in that country, had he been caught incapacitated, it is still likely that he gets maximum 3-4 years jail or he might not be found guilty (cause could go on for years) or he might buy them out?

And do you also realize, had she been "successfully" raped, no one would have sympathized with her? The shame would have been on her, and she would have been considered "dirty".

Because she managed to "prevent" the rape and "kill" the rapist - 1. People cannot treat her like rag. 2. Rapists know they have a severed head/penis waiting for them.

What I say might sound ridiculous, but stuff works differently here.  
 
 
Fair enough she defended herself, but she must have killed him, then cut his head off his dead body and then paraded around her town? Wow. I mean I understood that woman who cut off the guys penis, but killing a man then sawing through his neck for attempted rape??!
Baso there's self defense, and then there's self defense that turns just slightly psychopathic.
 
 
That woman is an effing legend.

In quoting that one individual post you appear to have missed the rest of what I was saying. I did say that the problem lies in the fact that the things you describe are allowed to take place, and are viewed as acceptable; the system need to be changed in order to prevent this. While killing a few of the rapists may help in the short term, it's unlikely to have a big effect on the number of rapes taking place. An overhaul of the justice system and the stigma surrounding rape would be much better for the women who are affected, in my opinion.
 
 
 
Nice job  

She should not be punished. It is a sad testament to the warped sense of modern justice, that we penalise people for killing thugs.

 

What imbeciles would give this comment a negative rating?! WHAAAAT!?!
 
 
he was just trying to f*** her.if she wanted to be fair she should cut only his d*ck.
 
 
not to rip his f****king head off!!
 
 
If he really did try to rape her, which I personally think he didn't, he should have tied her up first before raping her so she couldn't move or anything.
 
 
I think she went for the wrong head there...

The first strike could have killed him and then she could of cut of his head after he was dead or seriously wounded.
 
 
wow it's India she has some balls. Wow wow wow.
 
 
 
Maybe. But equally, how likely is it she got a clean chop to the neck of an assailant who attacked her from behind? Even had she managed to get away from him and swing, in that state of mind, a clean cut to the neck? Seems a little fishy, it could be true, but ehh...

 

Maybe she just swung with it as she turned around? I don't think he would have expected her to do something like that.
 
 
Daily mail?

Shes heading to jail now

 

getting a neg for that was a little harsh... it wasn't that bad...
 
 
2011 - The year when beheading people made a comeback.
 
 
It said in the article she had "bite marks on her face and neck" since when does rape consist of the man trying to cannibalize her.

Some people have very specialised "interests", maybe?

So determined was the woman to show that she had beaten off her attacker, who she claimed had been stalking her for three months, that she decided to take his head immediately to the local market.
 

Good decision.
