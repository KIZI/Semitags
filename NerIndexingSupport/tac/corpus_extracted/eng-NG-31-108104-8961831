I know some of you are J.B. fans.  Seems he lost a pet this week also.

on Friday night, Oct. 12 - John Barrowman and his partner, Scott
Gill, were forced to give permission to have their dog - Tiger - put
to sleep. The dog - their Dog Trust rescue dog (originally named
Tegan) - had suddenly fallen ill in the late afternoon and
unfortunately three tumors were found during exploratory surgery. Sad
to say the kindest thing to do was to make that hard decision.

They had only had Tiger 10 months but from all accounts the dog was
happy and healthy during his time in the Barrowman-Gill household.

John and Scott have asked anyone thinking of sending cards or flowers
to please instead make a donation to Dogs Trust on behalf of Tiger
Barrowman Gill. You can a donation via PayPal to
char ... @johnbarrowman.net (before 2 November) and the website will
make a bulk donation to Dogs Trust in Tiger's name

Oh man my heart goes out to them.

That has become two of my favorite shows.

I have not caught Torchwood (don't have the channel) but I have really
enjoyed the new Who series'.  I have watched it almost since it came on
(1969 +-) and have really missed it all those years it was off.  Despite
what some say I think the new shows are even better than the old ones.  I
do miss Billie Piper, however.

Guess I will need to get the DVDs to see Torchwood which may be a
blessing since I only have Sci-Fi in SD which is not so great for the
newer wide-screen shows.  Oh well, enough OT.
