What are you talking about?

Are you talking about how California, New Mexico, Arizona, Texas all WERE Mexico before we took it away?

Or are you talking about how Americans go to Mexico for medical tourism, because they can get medical and dental care there for an affordable price?

Or are you talking about how much Americans love tacos and burritos and nachos?

LOL!

Your thread is a funny mystery.

Mexico has been "Los Estados Unidos Mejicanos" (United States of Mexico) since 1810. I don't see that changing any time soon. They even print it on their money.

Now if you are referring to our growing population of Hispanics and illegals, well if they are legal they are as American as the rest of us. If they are illegal we need people in Washington to enforce the law.

And who said we took Texas away from them? The Republic of Texas willingly asked for Statehood. As they were their own separate country. Just like Hawaii.

Correct, and California was the Bear Flag Republic, an independent nation, when it asked for statehood and was admitted with the Compromise of 1850.

True, but you know I meant citizens of Hispanic decent. Such as my wife, whose family were citizens of the Republic of Texas.
