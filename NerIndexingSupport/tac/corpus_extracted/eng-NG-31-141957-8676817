So her dad is basically saying his daughter is a vicious animal and a
bully who needs to be heavily medicated so she doesn't act out her
violent urges on others.

Papa Williams: 'Serena is a pit bull, Venus is a gazelle' -- both are
in Open quarters

By HOWARD FENDRICH, AP Tennis Writer

AP - Sep 2, 10:18 pm EDT

NEW YORK (AP) -- When you hear about Serena and Venus Williams
overpowering opponents, as happened Sunday at the U.S. Open to two
recent Grand Slam finalists, it's easy to forget that the sisters are,
indeed, individuals.

And as similar as their on-court styles might seem, all stinging
serves and gargantuan groundstrokes, they are not quite carbon copies.

That point was driven home by their father and coach, Richard, who sat
courtside for the final game of Serena's 6-3, 6-4 victory over
Wimbledon runner-up Marion Bartoli, then watched Venus' 6-4, 6-2 win
against French Open runner-up Ana Ivanovic.

"Serena reminds me of a pit bull dog and a young Mike Tyson, all in
one," Dad said Sunday. "Venus reminds me of a gazelle that's able to
move, prance and jump. Venus looks as if she is really enjoying
herself out there more than Serena is right now. If they get by
everyone and meet each other, it will be an interesting match."

Another all-Williams showdown is indeed nearing at Flushing Meadows,
although unlike six previous meetings for major titles -- Serena leads
5-1 in those finals, Venus leads 7-6 overall -- this one would be a
semifinal.

"That would be awesome because it would mean that there is a Williams
in the final," Venus said. She also noted: "We have one more step."

For Serena, it's a familiar one. She will face No. 1 Justine Henin in
the quarterfinals at a third consecutive major, having lost to her at
the French Open and Wimbledon.

"Yeah, we know each other pretty well," Henin said after beating No.
15 Dinara Safina 6-0, 6-2 at night. "I know everyone was waiting for
that match, and here we are."

So you think Serena's father meant just that, the words you chose?

Its a pretty stupid thing for her father to say (out of hundreds of
things over the years).    He picked two of the most negative images
imaginable.    If a white commentator chose that description of
Serena, they would get fired by the end of the day.

There several possibilities:

Richard Williams mis-speaks; he's misquoted; he knows little else; he
attempted to draw a parallel to show Serenade's tenacity . . . and the
list goes on. Having watched her and her older sister grow up in the
area near our home and reading the numerous articles about the
sisters, she is one really tough, strong, overpowering player. If any
opponent plays to her strength, they get beaten up; if they finesse
the game, they stand a better chance of surviving a bit longer.

It's awfully presumptious of the author to gush about an all-
Williams
showdown in the SF when both are facing their recent nemeses in
the QFs. Venus is 0-3 in her last 3 matches vs Jankovic and Serena
has lost both her QFs at FO & W to Henin.
Having said that, it does appear that the hunger has returned to
the
sistahs after both wasted a couple of years losing focus on tennis.

But it's also worthwhile to note that Henin has never beaten SW (or
VW, for that matter) on a hard court and that SW did, in fact, beat
Henin in the Key Biscayne final this year after saving a couple of
matchpoints in the second set. As for VW, she does seem to be playing
a lot better now than she was at the French, so she'd generally be my
pick in a match against Jankovic on cement.

I still think SW is going to save her best tennis for the last few
matches to win the whole thing, especially now that her opponent in
the final will probably be someone like Kuznetsova, Peer, or
Chakvetadze.

++ Well, Richard Williams is considered the master of parental mis-
speak in professional tennis, a title he's held without blemish for
almost a decade... it was an odd comparison, one he's made before bye
the way, so at least he seems to mean it... I think he's is indeed
comparing her fighting spirit to Tyson, a VERY young Tyson I would
hope, since we know the guy from 23 and on wasn't 'all that' was he
Donn... :)

Why did I think you lived in Florida? Not sure myself...

Hope you are being good!

And if they somehow manage to play her close, she'll start going into
fist-pump convulsions and shrieking "COME ONNNNNNNNN!!!!!" as she
glares insanely at her opponent -- even when her opponent creates an
unforced error.  As the spittle runs down her chin.

Just, you know, to make absolutely sure her opponent's concentration
and focus is broken.

I don't see Serena beating Henin.  She has looked very sluggish for
the most part.  She's going to need to turn it on to AO final level to
beat Henin right now.
