President Barack Obama's bruising former chief of staff sat patiently for hours
Tuesday as lawyers and citizen objectors picked apart his personal life and
skills to try to invalidate Rahm Emanuel's bid to become Chicago's next mayor.

The heart of the legal challenge by some 30 objectors is whether Rahm Emanuel
should be disqualified for failing to meet residency requirements.

Mayoral candidates are required to be legal residents of the city for a year
before the February 22 primary.

The municipal code does not define residency, but state laws protect the
residency of anyone who temporarily leaves "on business of the United States."

Emanuel -- who was born in Chicago, raised in the suburbs and served a slice of
the city for years in the US House of Representatives -- contends that his
family's 2009 move to Washington was temporary and that Chicago remained his
"home."

Emanuel's opponents argue that the multimillionaire lost his residency status
when he rented out his Chicago home rather than leave it empty while he worked
in the White House.

"With all that money why would you need to rent out your house?" asked Paul
McKinley, a 'citizen objector' to Emanuel's candidacy.

"It was for the safety and security of the house, which was recommended by the
real estate people," Emanuel replied calmly.

The tough-talking politico, whose uncompromising style earned him the nickname
of "Rahmbo," remained placid through the seemingly endless and often repetitive
and belligerent questions.

He did laugh though, when McKinley wrapped up his questions with a nod to the
show trials of McCarthyism by asking: "Mr. Emanuel are you now or have you ever
been a member of the Communist Party?"

Emanuel resigned as Obama's top enforcer in October after powerful Mayor Richard
M. Daley shocked Chicago by announcing he would not be seeking a seventh term.

While Emanuel is considered the front-runner in the crowded race to run the
nation's third largest city, his success is far from assured.

The residency issue is also expected to drag on for months as a decision by the
city's board of elections will most certainly be appealed by either Emanuel or
his opponents.

Tuesday's circus-like proceedings in a cramped county hearing room with faulty
microphones felt a world away from the formality of the White House but were a
prime example of the rough and tumble politics that characterize the Windy City.

One lawyer accused him of running a "flop house" because Emanuel maintained that
the house he was renting out was his legal residence.

A citizen objector drew the ire of the hearing officer by asking Emanuel if he
was involved in bribery or blackmail and asking rambling questions trying to tie
him to a host of conspiracy theories, but was allowed to hold the floor for more
than half an hour.

Another woman embarked upon a sermon-like line of questioning in which she
insisted that "home is where you lay your head" and wondered at why Emanuel
hadn't done more to "secure his dream."

"Why is it that you, being a player in this political arena, how did you not
secure a place to call home or a residence when leasing your home and moving off
to Washington," Queen Sister Georzetta Deloney asked.

"We knew Daley wasn't going to last forever."

Hearing officer Joseph Morris explained to her that is "precisely" what Emanuel
thought he had done and "the purpose of this hearing is to give you a chance to
show that what he thinks is wrong."

Deloney's next question -- "how could you consider the Hermitage residence your
home if you don't have the keys" provided Emanuel the perfect opportunity to
state his case in a made-for-television stump speech.

"Less than two years ago I was a congressman representing the city of Chicago.
I'd been born here. I raised my kids here. Paid property taxes here," he began
before speaking of his family's strong ties to the city.

"The only reason I did not put my head down there was because the president of
the United States asked me to be his chief of staff."

Testimony is expected to continue for several days.
