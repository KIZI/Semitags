 
 
Sakujo's Security Thread: Pakistan
 
 
I'e been wanting to make this thread for a while now. Basically this is a thread dedicated to the security situation in Pakistan whether it be about a recent attack by the TTP or long term secruity with regards to policy in relation to India and Afghanistan. I might even turn this thread into a blog depending on how much time I have.

A little discalimer to non-Pakistanis that may read this, this thread is, by its nature, going to be grim. Every developing country has secruity issues and Pakistan is no exception. I hope that you don't judge Pakistan simply on its security situation, it is a vibrant country with a rich culture and huge potential.
 
 
To kick start this thread I wanted to know what TSR's opinion is on the reason why Pakistan has moved to arrest some key Taliban leaders (both Afghan and Pakistani) over the past month or two.

There are many different theories out there, some say it is a change in Pakistan's policy others say it is to destroy any peace talks and some even go to say some of the arrests are accidental.

My own take on it is taht two key developments have led to the arrests. Firstly, Washington and other powers have acknowledged Pakistani concerns in Afghanistan such as any withdrawal and the right of Pakistan to lead any peace talks. Secondly (and this is more discrete), the Jordanian bomber that killed the CIA operatives in Afghanistan appeared on a video with the now deceased leader of the TTP, Hakimullah Meshud. I have a hunch that some elements of the Afghani Taliban and the TTP had begun to move closer and to give each other assistance. As a result Pakistani intelligence have begun to pick off these members knowing that it won't hurt Pakistan's long term aims thanks to the new agreement with Western powers which makes the Taliban very much less valuable to Pakistan.

Thoughts?

I am not aware of the arrests, but Pakistan as have always been arresting somebody over the years, I think these arrests you have mentioned is due to the diabolical state Pakistan is right now.

Then you have all these bombs going off all around the country offcourse Pakistan needs to do something and arrest somebody plus they have to show to their west counterparts that they are doing something. I personally doubt it that they are doing something constructive as bombs are going off virtually every day in that country and hardly any sign of change is being seen and also their is also no evidence to suggest that the government is doing anything either.

I think its become more of a revolution to some extent, the Pakistani government its soldiers started a war with the Aghans/Pushtoons for no reason and massacarred so many of them without any constructive reason, just from the face of it we know they are combatting terrorism. But the question is were they really such a big threat and was it necessarry to go in there guns blazing ?

Personally I think the people at the top of Pakistans corrupt government are to blame for this whole mess, nearly all are crooks from bottom to top unfortunately, when you have rulers/politicians that are crooks what success do you think the country will achieve under such people ? If there is success its probably for the rich, as the rich get richer and the poor become even poorer.

These arrests are much more significant. They include the 2nd in command of the Afghan Taliban and are having an effect, there was a lull for about a month due to these arrests.

Pakistan is acting, it has carried out major operations in just about every tribal province to combat terrorism.

Yes, the TTP were bombing nearly every Pakistani city something needed to be done. I don't understand what you mean when you say that the governemtn started this war.

Corruption can hardly be blamed for the security situation.
 
 
Methinks this thread isn't going to get as much attention as the Israel one, but I hope it does. It's an interesting conflict and one, I'm sorry to say, I know absolutely nothing about.
 
 
A blast occured in  lahore  killing dozens of people. This is the first big attack on a Pakistani since the recent army offenses and arrests of top Taliban leaders. The Taliban still big as ever? I doubt it. Intelligence reports that around 600kg of explosives was used in the attack, compare with about 1000kg used in the attack on the Marriot which killed far more people. It takes quite a bit of time to gather that much explosives which suggest that this attack was planned long before the recent arrests. I think the militants were planning something a lot bigger than attacking a small intelligence building however the recent arrests disrupted the command chain meaning that a smaller target had to do. Explosives of course degrade with time so they didn't want 600kg to go to waste. Just a theory.
 
 
It seems the long awaited orkzai offensive has begun.

I might do a post outlining which tribal areas offensises have occured later on.  
 
 
Excellent article from the guardian, couldn't agree more:

 http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisf...errorism-trade 

 
Pakistan is making significant sacrifices, diverting resources from much-needed investment in infrastructure (transport, communications, education, energy, etc) to the war on terror. This, in turn, discourages foreign participation in the Pakistani economy, so we are losing out to competitors in key sectors. As if this was not enough, our largest trading partner, the European Union, many of whose members are major contributors to Nato forces, does not provide us a level playing field in terms of access to its markets.

There has been a rising trade deficit with the EU since 2005. Many of Pakistan's natural competitors already have, or are negotiating, preferential access to the EU market beyond that enjoyed by Pakistan – a list that includes Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and India.
.....

No other developing country in the world has undertaken so much as an ally in the war on terror. Failure to support Pakistan now will only extend the war and the looming global consequences. None of us wants to contemplate going down that route. The better way is clear – but it's in the EU's hands to grant.

 

If Pakistan wants to keep up the moementum against terrorism as the West wants, the West needs to help shore up its economy. Also, to the douchey comments about Pakistan having a nuclear programme, it needs one as it's main adversary is 8 times it's size.
 
 
I've decided to make this into a blog. I've also decided I'm gonna punctuate this thread with some positive stories now and again.

Pakistan's salt mines are a m a z i n g and I'm so glad I got to visit them.

 

These are the rooms any visitors stay in.

 

 

They put a light source behind the salt to make it glow like that. The different types of salts give the different colours.

 

 

Without the glow.

 

That's a mosque made out of salt.

Why was Pakistan Created?

Reasons for Partition

By the end of the 19th century several nationalistic movements had started in India. Indian nationalism had grown largely since British policies of education and the advances made by the British in India in the fields of transportation and communication. However, their complete insensitivity to and distance from the peoples of India and their customs created such disillusionment with them in their subjects that the end of British rule became necessary and inevitable.

However, while the Indian National Congress was calling for Britain to Quit India, the Muslim League, in 1943, passed a resolution for them to Divide and Quit. There were several reasons for the birth of a separate Muslim homeland in the subcontinent, and all three parties-the British, the Congress and the Muslim League-were responsible.

The British had followed a divide-and-rule policy in India. Even in the census they categorised people according to religion and viewed and treated them as separate from each other. They had based their knowledge of the peoples of India on the basic religious texts and the intrinsic differences they found in them instead of on the way they coexisted in the present. The British were also still fearful of the potential threat from the Muslims, who were the former rulers of the subcontinent, ruling India for over 300 years under the Mughal Empire. In order to win them over to their side, the British helped establish the M.A.O. College at Aligarh and supported the All-India Muslim Conference, both of which were institutions from which leaders of the Muslim League and the ideology of Pakistan emerged. As soon as the League was formed, they were placed on a separate electorate. Thus the idea of the separateness of Muslims in India was built into the electoral process of India.

There was also an ideological divide between the Muslims and the Hindus of India. While there were strong feelings of nationalism in India, by the late 19th century there were also communal conflicts and movements in the country that were based on religious communities rather than class or regional ones. Some people felt that the very nature of Islam called for a communal Muslim society. Added to this were the memories of power over the Indian subcontinent that the Muslims held on to, especially those in the old centers of Mughal rule. These memories might have made it exceptionally diffficult for Muslims to accept the imposition of colonial power and culture. They refused to learn English and to associate with the British. This was a severe drawback for them as they found that the Hindus were now in better positions in government than they were and thus felt that the British favored Hindus. The social reformer and educator, Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, who founded M.A.O. College, taught the Muslims that education and cooperation with the British was vital for their survival in the society. Tied to all the movements of Muslim revival was the opposition to assimilation and submergence in Hindu society. Sir Syed Ahmed Khan was also the first to conceive of a separate Muslim homeland.

Hindu revivalists also deepened the chasm betweent he two nations. They resented the Muslims for their former rule over India. Hindu revivalists rallied for a ban on the slaughter of cows, a cheap source of meat for the Muslims. They also wanted to change the official script form the Persian to the Hindu Devanagri script, effectively making Hindi rather than Urdu the main candidate for the national language.

Congress made several mistakes in their policies which further convinced the League that it was impossible to live in a undivided India after freedom from colonial rule because their interests would be completely suppressed. One such policy was the institution of the "Bande Matram," a national anthem which expressed anti-Muslim sentiments, in the schools of India where Muslim children were forced to sing it.

The Muslim League gained power also due to the Congress. The Congress banned any support for the British during the Second World War. However the Muslim League pledged its full support, which found favour form them from the British, who also needed the help of the largely Muslim army. The Civil Disobedience Movement and the consequent withdrawal of the Congress party from politics also helped the league gain power, as they formed strong ministries in the provinces that had large Muslim populations. At the same time, the League actively campaigned to gain more support from the Muslims in India, especially under the guidance of dynamic leaders like Jinnah.

There had been some hope of an undivided India, with a government consisting of three tiers along basically the same lines as the borders of India and Pakistan at the time of Partition. However, Congress' rejection of the interim government set up under this Cabinet Mission Plan in 1942 convinced the leaders of the Muslim League that compromise was impossible and partition was the only course to take.

 

I didn't write the above but it explains why Pakistan was created.

tl;dr

Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs largely got along until the British came and implemented a divide and rule policy. This pitted different sections of soceity against each other in order to gain full control of the country but also lead to seperatism between each religion. A number of events then led Muslims in India to belive that a seperate homeland would ensure their survival. A united India was proposed but was rejected by Congress so full independence became the only solution.
 
 
Found  this  which satires what is wrong with the mentality of some Pakistanis. The references might be lost on non-Pakistanis though, here are my favourites.

 
10. Democracy is a deeply flawed system that has destroyed the world. Totalitarian monarchies with entrenched security and bureaucracies are much better and in line with our Arab origins. Please do not compare us to India. We have nothing in common with them except our DNA, culture, cuisine, language, music, and geography.
 

 
12. Lately, we have been reading some Chomsky, Klein and Zinn (all five articles) and appreciate how these believing Muslims provide us with the intellectual ammo on exposing how the perfidious Jews conspire to rule the world.
 

 
18. We, the members of civil society, are essentially a liberal lot who are imbued with socialist values. Our ability to engage in massive socialising (through Facebook) makes us socialist in the true sense of the word. Lately, we have also dabbled in Marxism at cafes where we blow off half a month’s average national salary on lattes and cappuccinos whilst we construct our neo- Marxism around the tacit acceptance of the Taliban’s superior Arab cultural identity. We salute Abul Ala Marx, Lenin Bin Laden, and Mulla Mao!

Why would a pakistani start a thread which would set his country open for critism...

you must be one of those liberal self hating pakistanis....

Pakistan problems stem from failure to develop Government institution in the 50s this was a result of the death of key Independence leaders and a Indian Economic and water blockade which mean devastation to agricultural base and to small Industry which had historically export stuff to Central India for finishing. Pakistan also had to deal with 10% of its population being refugees huge Water Problem and building a government from scratch surrounded by Hostile Nations. Pakistan was also at a disadvantage that most of the Civil Servants in British Raj were Hindu so Pakistan inherited a Civil Service with little experience or expertise.

in the 60s- Pakistan fought a successful but costly war with India, got caught by the Soviet Union for allowing US spy Planes, but overall a economically successful time for Pakistan with High GDP growth and real terms increase in spending power.
but Politically Military rule was bad for the country many people dissatisfied with current political set up become radicals which would effect Pakistan later.Although initially Military was right in its plan to hold new election it was wrong to govern under Martial Law

70s- Started of Bad with loss to India and US economic Sanction began to slow down the Economy. But the election of Zulifcar Ali Bhutto boosted the Economy and a new constitution was written,Industries were built and Alliances were strengthen with China,America and the Muslim World political Stability ensured. Bhutto sets up the first meeting between America and China. He also starts the Pakistan Nuclear Programme in response to Indian nuclear threat. The decade ended with a Military coup brought on the back of CIA funded riots to remove the Socialist, Zulficar Ali Bhutto, who is eventually executed by Zia-ul-Haq with American Blessing

80s-Lost Decade I- Zia-ul-Haq rules under Draconian military rule with US support, Politically the former party of Zulficar is forced into exile other moderate parties are squashed and Islamist parties are encouraged to grow for the Soviet- Afgan War. Mass US funding keep Zia - Ul-Haq and his alliance of convenience with Islamic parties in Power.Economically & Military the country grows in Strength, but although the economy grows as a result of US aid there is 0 Economic Development and much of 70s gain in social reform and poverty reduction is lost. Pakistan Civil Service becomes Politicised. Reports of Security agencies arresting political Prisoners are wide spread. Corruption Increases. Saudi Influence in Country grows. Relations with nearby countries are strained

90s-Lost Decade II -. End of Soviet Afgan war, US reinstalls sanctions and freezes 5Billion Dollars of Pakistan assets.
General Zia Dies but his old friends take over military but do hold elections. The party of former Zulficar Ali Bhutto is the dominant party of the 90s.
Democratic governments are undermined by the Military and do not complete 5 year terms, many of the Democratic Governments are corrupt but so are the Military Governments
Military coups and ISI using public money to destabilize civilian government through out decade.
Fundamental Islamic Parties with ex Zia officials support become very vocal in this time. Harsh US sanction hurt Pakistan and Moderate parties, whilst Indias blow of sanctions is soften thanks to to its historic links with Russia/Soviet Union. Pakistan becomes first Muslim Nuclear Power. Pakistan external Debt rises hugely and Zias legacy haunts the country.

2000s - Mushraff rules country for most of this decade overthrowing the Corrupt and Brain child of Zia-ul-haq,Nawaz Shariff but goes beyond his mandate to remove the government by trying to rule the country. After 9/11 Mushraff gets huge America support, and stays in power as a result although Pakistan enjoys economic and political stability most of this is built on US Aid and Suspension of Political Parties and other Judiciary. Government invests in infrastructure and very effective in economic development and running country.But fails to get EU and USA market Access which would have secured long term Growth and BOP crises looms. Post 2005 Security Situation is very poor Mushraff fails to tackle domestic and Saudi funded Terrorist, but allegations he sold country cheap to America and violated constitution force him eventually to resign. Mushraff signs a deal with America & Britain in Dubai to allow the Corrupt Political Parties banned earlier to participate in Elections in exchange for Mushraff safe exit from power. Nawaz Shariff and Benazir Bhutto,who is later killed return to Pakistan. Military of Pakistan develops own Fighter jets and Long range Missiles in this Time Period.Pakistan has Free Media but Accusation the free Media is irresponsible in opposition to government persist.

2010 - Democratic Start to decade with Weak Unpopular President with Equally Unpopular opposition.Economy weak and in recession. Success of Pakistan lies in American Withdrawal from Afghanistan and benefiting from being free of US sanction and being in a position where its politically stable to attract investment. Pakistan start decade with Independent Judiciary.Military seems committed to remain impartial but who knows

Through out the past 60 years, India threatens to swallow the country and refuses to treat it equally forcing Pakistan to spend huge money on Defence. India frequently makes provocative statement and the Indian Media is very anti Pakistan and very active in promoting Pakistan negatively on the world Stage.

India has its problem with Maoist and many domestic terrorist e.g ULFA and huge Concentration of Wealth in small Elite Caste Families. India also had the advantage of inheriting British Assets,Soviet Alliance and Long Period of 1 Family(gandi-nehru) rule. but I have not Mentioned Indian Problems as this is a Pakistan related Forum

Pakistan was created because the Hindus rejected Mohammed Ali Jinnah 14 points which would have secured the rights of Muslims of India. As gandi become increasingly Hindu in his outlook and turned from Secular movement to hindu movement it became clear to Jinnah a separate Dominion was needed,

Whilst some Indian want peace if you read the Indian media the vast majority see Pakistan as sub human, and want see partition as mistake which is code for it was wrong and we should undo it.

The British and Indians try too fool the muslim of India by granting them Pakistan immediately with no intermim period with the hope it would collapse soon. Even today many Indains see Pakistan the way china sees Taiwan

Less popular, less involvment of foreign powers (although still substantial), less crucial to world security.  
 
 
 

A quick summary of Pakistani offenses against the Taliban.

Massive operations in Swat and South Waziristan. Two operations to clear Bajur of the Taliban. Shelling and airstrikes in Orakzai developing into another ground offensive. Limited operations in Dir and Khyber. In addition numerous raids by Pakistani intelligence in the southern city of Karachi and in Peshawar. Plus you have the US drone attacks all throughout the tribal reigons.

Rumours that low level operations have started in North Waziristan are circulating on the net.
 
 
 http://www.ndtv.com/news/world/india...tate-18796.php 

 
Arguing that Islamabad is using terrorism as a tool for its foreign policy, especially against India, an Indian-American group asked Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Wednesday to declare Pakistan as a terrorist State and seize all its nuclear weapons.
 

Pakistan gets a lot of flack in the media for supposedly threatning India all the time. Little attention is paid to the fact that the "Crush India" Brigade died out decades ago in Pakistan, Pakistan doesn't wish to destroy India. However, the "Crush Pakistan" Brigade in India is still alive. Often the thinking is that Pakistan supports "terror" in India (ignoring the fact these groups operate due to the occupation of Kashmir) and by extension the whole Pakistan is a threat, therefore the whole of Pakistan must be destroyed in order to destroy terrorism.

The popular view in Pakistan that India is a threat is for the following reasons:

1) Occupation of Kashmir

2) Agressive nuclear policy, it was India that first began testing nukes causing a nuclear arms race between the two countries.

3) India is many times Pakistan's size in many different respects, population, economy, land mass and military (India has a military twice that of Pakistans). Coupled with calls by Indians to "reunite" India, many Pakistanis feel that India is trying to swallow them up.

An example of what I'm talking about :

 http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-ne...-Bal-Thackeray 

 
Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray on Friday flayed tennis star Sania Mirza for her decision to marry Pakistani cricketer Shoaib Malik, saying "had Sania's heart been Indian, it wouldn't have beaten for a Pakistani."
" Henceforth, Sania will not remain an Indian. Had her heart been Indian, it wouldn't have beaten for a Pakistani. If she wished to play for India, she should have chosen an Indian life partner," 84-year-old Thackeray said in an editorial in party mouthpiece Saamana.

I personally feel that this is a great opportunity for Pakistan to exploit the India-China hostility. Sadly due to the utter incompetence of our so-called leaders who are corrupt to the core, all we have accomplished thus far is the antagonising of China. Upon the transfer of presidency from Musharraf to Zardari, Beijing lacked an ambassador for a long period of time as Mr. Zardari debated which one of his close confidants to install in China. As I understand, the delay is thought to be due to pressure from Mr. Haqqani (Pakistan's Ambassador to the US) who was pushing for a more "anti-China" ambassador (a bizarre move considering the traditionally friendly ties between Pakistan and China).

This had the effect of annoying China, with some lessening of tension coming in the form of visits to Beijing by General Kayani and Shahbaz Sharif.

On another note, what do you make of the 18th amendment? Do you think that the Sharif brothers will get the limit on the number of terms in office for a PM removed?

I part of me doesn't want to believe this but sadly I'm sure you're correct.

Pakistan shouldn't "exploit" tensions but rather Pakistan should learn to the play the game. We shouldn't let our relationship with the Chinese become India-centric merely using them to get at India, our relationship should be Pakistan-centric. The Chinese are one the few nations that have invested in the long term in Pakistan and their is mutual respect between the two countries. Pakistan should build upon this, I would like to see a delegation to China in a similar way to the delegation to the US.

The US might give Pakistan money and weapons but China will give us a bridge and a dam.

Firstly I think its pathetic that there is an 18th amendment. The constitution should govern the country and politics, politics shouldn't govern the constitution. Can you imagine the reaction in America if a politician proposed an amendment to the constitution? Decide on a constitution and stick with it.  

But the proposed reforms are largely positive and should go a long way to restoring civilian democratic rule. I'm hoping they'll manage to reform unjust laws such as the Hadood ordinace and the blasmephy laws which although good on paper just caused a huge amount of trouble for Pakistanis.

I really hope that the limit will stay though but not so much that I'd like to see these reforms drowned. By removing the limit you open up the opportunity for someone to rule indefinately. But sadly I think it will probably be included to pacify the opposition.

30 militants, 6 soldiers dead in Orakzai.

I really think this reigon is the last refuge for militants in Pakistan hence why the fighting is so intense.
 
 
As I said earlier the  offensive in the North Waziristan has begun . The telegraph is quoting the same source as before so we won't know fro sure until another source reports it. For those of you who don't know, North Waziristan is the place where the West has urged an offensive from Pakistan as it is belived that the Taliban that attack troops in Afghanistan live in North Waziristan.
 
 
So I found a really good summary of Pakistan's political parties albeit written by a secular marxist:

The Media Revolution In Pakistan

 http://aawsat.com/english/news.asp?section=5&id=20460 

 
Officials from the credible and private opinion poll agency, Gallup International, told Asharq Al-Awsat that the viewership of anchorpersons like Dr Shahid Masood and Kamran Khan reaches millions. Both of them and many other anchors of popular talk shows are the product of Pakistan’s media revolution, which has broken all social and political taboos and was the main force behind the ousting of former President Pervez Musharraf’s government and is advocating a new form of political morality. This media revolution has recently been described as a main force behind the formation of consensus in Pakistani society to oppose religious extremism and militancy.

Many television presenters have become popular figures in Pakistani society. "I have been so concerned about the safety of journalists in times of political crisis that I always call offices of TV channels and ask them about the wellbeing of the well-known journalists and anchor persons," said Shahnaz Khan, a young teacher in a high school.

But not everyone is so sympathetic towards the private news channels. "The role of private news channels is not at all positive, and especially in times of political crisis they become more aggressive in their presentation of the news and talks shows," said Azeem Ahmed, a journalist-turned-politician who was close to the Musharraf government.

Ten years ago Pakistan had only one news channel and that was owned and run by the government. Now the number of news channels exceeds one hundred operated by a combination of professional journalists and business entrepreneurs. “Together they are keeping the Pakistani masses glued to their television screens,” said one media expert. It could be about any aspect of Pakistani life; politics, religion, the fashion industry, terrorism or maybe family disputes. “You will find it on Pakistani channels” said the expert.
 

A hundred news channels.  

I don't think many countries in the world can compete with that.
 
 
Maoist attacks in India

 10 Indian policemen killed and 10 injured in a landmine attack 
 Maoists kill at least 72 soldiers in central India attack 
 Maoists have destroyed over 25 school buildings in the last year 
 Maoists torch road construction machines
 
This post is going to be dedicated to attacks in India by Maoists. Interestingly none of this makes international headlines despite the use of terrorism and the high death count.
 
 
The TTP has finally after a whole month managed to attack again with a bomb blast in Dir  killing at least 43  and  4 bomb blasts killing 7 near the US consulate in Peshawar. 

Am I worried? Not really. The attack in Dir was a cheap shot at a civilian parade, probably one bomber with reports suggesting 10kg of explosives, not much can be done about this type of attack. Dir hasn't actually been cleared of the Taliban so its interesting that they couldn't carry out such an attack in Swat where there's an army presence.

The attack on the consulate was a complete failure. 4 car bombs managed left 7 dead including 4 of the attackers. It seems the TTP is getting increasingly desperate for a show of strength and as a result becoming more amateurish. Most of the experienced militants are bogged down in Orakzai fighting the army, that or they're dead.

Anyway, it seems the TTP has pretty much signed its death warrant with these attacks. Eroding what little support they had in Dir and confirming to everyone that they must be eliminated. Nice one.  

EDIT:  At least 16 militants killed today  and  6 suspects arrested  in connection to the Dir blast.

EDIT 2: More info on the Peshwar blast

 
At least 12 people were killed in a series of bomb and suicide explosions Monday afternoon on the US consulate in the high-security zone of Peshawar, the capital of the restive NWFP.

Among the dead were six attackers, two security personnel, a civilian and three foreigners, whose identities were, however, not immediately known. At least 18 people were injured.

To be honest, I reckon they'll always have some support in terms of people who take up radical steps to escape the injustices that are endemic in Pakistani society, whether they be social, cultural, educational or financial.

I agree unfortunately when the cat is out of the bag it's much harder to get it back in. I estimate it'll take at least another year to destroy the back bone of the TTP and regain reigons held by them and it'll take a few more to mop up remaining cells. There's signs of hope though, Swat has been relatively peaceful since the offensive there and massive amounts of investment is going in.

Actually if Pakistan really wants to end this insurgency it has to capture top leaders:

 
So yet again, some questions have to be asked. First, where are the Qari Hussains and Hakeemullah Mehsuds (he has risen from the ‘dead’) hiding? The intelligence and security agencies have made some decent progress in the war against militancy but they have still, by and large, failed to capture or kill most of the top militant commanders. For example in Swat, of the 50 most-wanted militants about 80 per cent have been accounted for by the security forces, but the ones who are missing are part of the top leadership. In other militancy-hit areas, too, a similar pattern has been established. Where is Tariq Afridi? Where is Faqir Mohammed? The reason it is important to get these top leaders is becoming increasingly apparent. Sophisticated and devastating attacks like those launched on Monday would be infinitely more difficult for middle-ranking or lower-tier militants to pull off on their own. Moreover, the top commanders have repeatedly pledged to keep on attacking targets, indicating that they have no intention of melting away and giving up the fight.
 
 
 
It's stories like this that put a smile on my face:

 http://www.businessweek.com/news/201...-year-end.html 

 
April 9 (Bloomberg) -- Pakistan’s stocks, the cheapest in Asia, may advance by 23 percent in the next eight months, buoyed by overseas funds and improved company earnings, according to National Investment Trust Ltd.

“All the fundamentals indicate that the market will pare most of its losses of the past two years” and reach 13,000 by end-December, Manzoor Ahmed, who manages the equivalent of $857 million as head of asset management at state-owned National Investment, Pakistan’s largest equity fund, said in an interview yesterday. “The economy is in a good recovery phase.”
 

It shows one of the key attributes that makes me follow Pakistan so closely, potential. Despite taking in millions of refugees and fighting numerous battles with Taliban and despite the civilian government being weak, Pakistan's economy is grrowing. Imagine if Pakistan could sort out its problems.  
 
 
You forgot to add this:

 'Scores dead' in Pakistan air raids 

 Pakistan admits civilian deaths in air strike.

I haven't "forgotten" anything. I haven't posted since 5 days ago since I've been busy with work but thank you for posting this anyways.

As I suspected not all those killed in the recent air strikes were from the TTP but some were civilians. The Pakistan army had become reckless recently by overrelying on the air force and not on ground troops, this might be because its becoming stretched by the recent operations elsewhere. At least a considerable amount of compensation has been payed out to each family something in the reigon of 10s if not 100s of thousands of dollars.
 
 
Pakistanis are a bunch of coward losers, maybe that's why it surrendered its sovereignity to UK and USA multiple times in the past and continues to do so in the present.

As far as I know, Pakistan was one of only 3 countries in the world to recognize the Taliban government in Afghanistan. Pakistan also nurtured the Taliban of Pakistan-Afghanistan, trained them, provided weapons imported from elsewhere to them.

I also never heard/read/saw any attacks on Pakistan by these Taliban until Pakistan (because it is a country of cowards) attacked the Taliban at the order of its anglo-amerikan masters.

Pakistan has no potential.

A country that can squander its chances so many times has no potential to grab any chance offered to it. A country which has the largest coal reserves in the world should not be energy-starved and havng frequent power outages.

Stock markets rise and fall everywhere, it's a bit of a gamble. Pakistan's economy has been tanking, that's mostly because investors fled, and no sector is experiencing a boom. Pakistan has nothing to offer to investors. It's a failed state relying on donation from western countries and Muslim countries.

However, as it was a servant of UK for centuries and continue to toe its anglo-amerikan masters' line for fear of reprisal, even if it means doing anti-Islamic activities like killing more Muslims in its own territory, Pakistan government won't hesitate to do so.

Pakistanis are a nation of cowards to be sure.

German Ambassador Dr Michael Koch told a news conference in Islamabad that Pakistan has immense potential of harnessing renewable sources of energy to bridge gap between supply and demand of energy.

The German envoy estimated that Pakistan has the potential of harnessing 41,722MW of hydro power, 346,000MW of wind energy and 2.9 million MW of solar energy...Pakistan is so far exploiting about 6,600MW in the form of hydro-power schemes of the renewable energy resources

Dr Koch said that Pakistan has tremendous potential for foreign investments ; however hindrance in the way of investment is only the security situation, a fact that could not be denied.

Pakistan isn't relying on aid and donations as you make out. Most of the aid is in the form of military aid, the civilian sector isn't receiving much and most of the funds approved for release haven't been released by the US.

The average growth rate for Pakistan has been 7% per year, even when the whole world was in recession and Pakistan was facing its toughest year in decades the economy still grew by 2%.

Pakistan has a whole lot to offer investors, it has the 3rd largest wheat output in Asia, a massive cotton/textiles industry and produces a quater of the world's medical instruments for example.

You can't be serious? If you really cared about killing Muslims and anti-Islamic activities you would condemn the Taliban for strapping bombs to children and making them explode in civlian markets, schools and hospitals not the Pakistani army for trying to prevent such things.

I'm kinda sick of people saying that Pakistan tows the US line on everything. If that's so why hasn't the Pakistani army attacked North Waziristan, you know the place that NATO has been begging Pakistan to act upon for the last 9 years?

Maybe you missed the beheadings of anti-Taliban tribal leaders, policemen and politicians and the burning of government buildings and schools in Swat then?
 
 
Sorry guys will post something soon
 
 
So the militants have begun to regroup and are once again attacking civilian areas hospitals, school, bazars etc. But their choice of targets betrays their own weaknesses simply because they were once attacking embassies and luxury hotels in Islamabad but are now reduced to attacking political parades (of a party that is against the offensives in the tribal reigon) and hospitals. This just reinforces the need to capture the top commanders who are the main perpetrators of the violence.

Maybe you don't know about Pakistan. A country as violence-prone, towing the western line to please her western masters (even its constitution is British in origin, not Islamic), having political instability and lack of any attractive "features" really doesn't attract investors.

Having wheat output (even if it's true) won't change anything, Pakistan also has the 5th largest population in Asia, isn't it? Can Pakistan feed herself? What % are malnourished? Regarding the medical instruments part, you must be joking.

There is no medical device (of note) built in Pakistan. Can you show me a simple X-Ray machine built in Pakistan?

Nobody begs Pakistan, nor can they. You should learn to come out of it. Pakistan is the beggar, not vice versa.

Here, just one Pakistani newspaper itself admitting Pakistan is the beggar. It sounds really odd if a Pakistani thinks others beg Pakistan to do a thing.

Pakistan received $18 bn US aid since 9/11
 

 
 
 

Ok. Good point. The best that you can do.

1) Many countries received loans from the IMF, Iceland, Greece, Britain etc and its not uncommon for a developing country to owe loans and debts.

2) Most aid to Pakistan is miliatary aid, the civilians sector doesn't receive much at all.

Asian Development Outlook (ADO) 2009 has projected Pakistan's economic growth at 2.8 percent for current fiscal year 2008-09 due to the impact of the global slowdown, tight demand management policies and the power deficit.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interna...ion_statistics 

Pakistan is 5th in the world. And wheat is a hugely important assest to a country as it brings in foreign exchange and declining wheat output was one of the many reasons the USSR couldn't compete with the US during the Cold War. Wheat like many things in developing isn't equally distributed and is often exported rather than used for internal consumption.

I read this in NewScientist and its well known that the medical industry in Sialkot is massive.

1) Musharraf has never been my leader.

2) I never wanted Pakistan to join the War on Terror but neitheir do I want Pakistan to stand around whilst innocent people are being killed.

3) I couldn't care less who "started" it while hospitals and schools are being bombed.

You dodged the question:

Military aid by the US is offered to Pakistan in order to enhance its capabilities, the US is trying to appease Pakistan by offering this aid.

8 troops killed in North Waziristan. The rumours regarding the TTP setting up base in the North after losing in the South are porbably true, I wonder if this would spur Pakistan into another offensive.

The military campaigns are useless unless the central government builds up infrastucture in areas its cleared. So far that hasn't happened at all.

You're correct I would like to see more mobilisation on this fron however significant steps are being taken in Swat at least.

 http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn...040103365.html 

 
The military is rebuilding roads, schools and libraries. It is buying computers for women's vocational institutes and solar-powered streetlights for villages. It is planting a million trees.

In the long term they'll need to do a lot more than that. The insurgents are from the Pashtun region and are not indigenous to Swat. If the area is to fall under Pakistani soveringty they'll need to build up police forces, courts, and most importantly a system of government not at odds with the local culture. Also, the Pakistani government is quite trigger happy and have little training in counter-insurgency. They'll need to overhaul the entire military culture to that which was designed to counter India, to fighting insurgents. They're locally very heavy handed and have engaged in extrajudicial killings and harsh interrogation tehcniques. I don't know if you've seen this, but a video was released last October showing how the army deal with suspects in Swat- they would beat the **** out of them to create an atmosphere of fear. And that's just in public; who knows what they do in secret. All of this contributes to failing at the basic provision of killing more insurgents than are being recruited.

They'll need to overhaul the entire military culture to that which was designed to counter India, to fighting insurgents. They're locally very heavy handed and have engaged in extrajudicial killings and harsh interrogation tehcniques. I don't know if you've seen this, but a video was released last October showing how the army deal with suspects in Swat- they would beat the **** out of them to create an atmosphere of fear. And that's just in public; who knows what they do in secret. All of this contributes to failing at the basic provision of killing more insurgents than are being recruited.

 

I agree with you 100% but any change in use of force against suspects would require a change in the whole policing structure which isn't likely to happen.

The Pentagon says that Pakistan has moved 100000 toops from the India to border to the Afghanistan border.

The situation is escalating in all the tribal areas, it seems that the TTP has regrouped in the last major stronghold of militants in North Warizistan and is attacking Swat and South Warizistan. However, any offensive would be complicated to carry out.

The is coupled with rumours that the TTP leader is still alive which just emphasises the point that the top leaders must be taken out if you really want to dent the TTP.

You do realise that the army of Pakistan does not fight for the word of God or rule by the word of God. That it fights those who aim to rule by the word of God, that it allows Non Muslim forces onto its lands, that it is allied with the enemies of this religion, that it does not carry out the responsibilities in the Shariah, that it fights to protect its rule by its laws.???

I don't think that's much of an issue. The Americans took out Baitullah Mehsud and the TTP just replaced him with Hakimullah, who is even more brutal an ruthless. Even if they kill him they'll replace him and it wouldn't make a difference. The insurgency isn't based around a charasmatic leader, rather ideology.

Is the TTP fighting for the word of God? No, a group that gains funds through kidnap, extortion and heroin smuggling to arm conscripted children to blow up bazaars, hospitals and even masjids killing thousands of innocent people can never be considered to fight for the word of God. The TTP only fight for themselves, the majority of fighters are seeking emplyoment and some revenge and they assassinate any learned person that disgrees with them.

Same old lies. Stories made up by you and the kuffar news.

The TTP is much more centralised organisation than say Al Qaeda. Specific people carry out specific tasks, one is tasked with recruitment for example. By taking out such people you drain the TTP of the technical know how needed to strike. Of course the TTP leader is largely a figure head and easily replaced but the one skilled in explosives isn't.

Why? You haven't said why they're wrong.

Also, you do realise that half the time the TTP claim that they carried out these attacks?

And before you start throwing around accusations, learn a little about me.

Lets ignore the TTP for a moment. Lets say they don't exist.

Moving on, Islamically you are not allowed to support the Pakistani government or its army. Do you understand this?

I know enough about where your allegiance lies from this one thread.

Why should I refute something when you bring no proof?

And don't bother bringing 'claims of responsibility' from kuffar news sources, because time and again the enemies of Allah send in these fake claim to the kuffar news. The only claim I will accept is from the news sources of the mujihideen or a video from their leaders.

Again you have nothing to show in this regard, how are these stories fake. The TTP openly admits they use suicide bombings so when a suicide bombing occurs who do you think did it? And you do realise that these "kuffar" news are sometimes pro-TTP?

The only source you will accept regarding the TTP is the TTP themselves? Well they're not going to be biased in the least are they?

I would rather accept the words of sincere muslims over sell outs, apostates and kuffar.

What stories? You have not linked us to anything. Furthermore, if you give me a news article which says that the TTP did this or that, I will reject it totally unless I see an official claim from them. Until then, I will follow Islaam and distrust the media of the enemies of Islaa.

O you who believe! If a rebellious evil person comes to you with a news, verify it, lest you harm people in ignorance, and afterwards you become regretful to what you have done.

If I do link to anything you will reject as you state in your second sentence. The TTP do not claim every incident precisely because they know that people will realise the frauds they are.

 Just today.

Not all the media is against Islam, most is impartial or even pro-TTP but you can't hide from the fact that hundreds of innocent people have died and the only group which is active enough to do this is the TTP.

A hundred news channels.  

I don't think many countries in the world can compete with that.

 

On the contrary, many countries have multiple times the number of channels which is nothing unusual.

Most Pakistani channels are not even watched by non Pakistanis, there is not much to compete over.

This post is going to be dedicated to attacks in India by Maoists. Interestingly none of this makes international headlines despite the use of terrorism and the high death count.

 

If by "international" you mean "western" news, then it's only natural that western world finds in India a country that was historically its loyal, obedient servant and shows no sign of deviating from that path.

Nor is India a capable enough power to challenge the individual middle powers in the Western world let alone the entire world. Also it serves as a useful tool to weaken and divert China's massive and growing military-industrial-scientific complex and other powers.

As the Western world is exclusively Christian (though Jews have snuck into the West as well), and the only nonwestern groups to have ruled and also coincidentally excelled over the Western world for many centuries is the nonwestern Muslims from the neighbouring region of Europe, you can understand why there has been an intense western campaign against Muslim world by the West.

Pakistan, being the second most populous Muslim country, and unlike Indonesia (which claims to be secular, hence remains utterly backward compared to the likes of Iran, Saudi Arabia, Oman, or Malaysia) Pakistan is an avowedly "Islamic" state (though in practise it has never been an Islamic state. Even its constitution, its legal code is mostly British.   ) makes it a prominent target for the West.

Remember that Pakistan has also developed nuclear weapons thanks to foreign expertise which the West never liked, and unlike most countries in the middle east which were prevented from doing so by the West at the zionists' behest, Pakistan was overlooked and ignored as it appeared Pakistan aims nuclear weapons at India.

While Kazakhstan and Turkey did/do have caches of nuclear weapons, they are/were not indigenously developed.

Pakistan is therefore part of the wider "target" that is the Muslim world. The Western world is looking to "perpetuate" its rule, its "dominance" (or so it thinks) over the world, and its harrowing experiences at hands of Muslim (mostly nonwestern) for centuries need to "rectified" if you believe those westerners.

It's indeed a war against Muslim world. Full fledged war involving theatrics, propaganda, religious insults, religious violations, murder, terrorism, war, and many other crimes. Western world has conveniently found many traitors within the Muslim world as well.

It'll be interesting to see how China's growth affects this political power play and where Muslim world stands. China's strength vis-a-vis the Muslim world is its far sighted, unified, determined political leadership while the Muslim world has no unity whatsoever (57 countries which mostly have no links with one another, and where most neighbouring Muslim countries have disputes with one another. So the idea of a common leadership is far-fetched at this time. And that is what the Western world likes.

That is why western world is categorically against the establishment of a Khilafat/Caliphate and uses its "puppets" to arrest/intimidate/ban/murder/prohibit all sorts of calls for Islamic movements or Khilafat.

Pakistanis, being a mostly cowardly nation that served their British masters for two centuries, bent over willingly and is following her masters' orders without a thought.

1) Many countries received loans from the IMF, Iceland, Greece, Britain etc and its not uncommon for a developing country to owe loans and debts.
 

I don't keep track of them all, but you can't seriously compare Paki and British economy, can you?

If you want to humiliate Pakistan, be my guest. I can bring out the figures for UK and Pakistani economies.

 
2) Most aid to Pakistan is miliatary aid, the civilians sector doesn't receive much at all.
 

Pakistan receives aid in the billions, in direct and indirect ways. I don't care much more than that. Such a country should be officially called a beggar, though diplomacy demands otherwise.

Oh well, you would probably claim Pakistan is not a beggar, and westerners are not being diplomatic.

Is this "extraordinary"? Did you know Sudan's growth rate in the last 5 years? It was higher than China's (for comparison). This is while Sudan is under intense western media propaganda, embargo, its leader has even been convicted by the immoral hypocritical western criminal courts (who never bothered to try Tony Blair, George Bush and UK/US leaders, thus showing their blatant hypocrisy ).

Sudan also happened to turn to Islamic laws much more so than most countries.

 
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interna...ion_statistics 

Pakistan is 5th in the world. And wheat is a hugely important assest to a country as it brings in foreign exchange and declining wheat output was one of the many reasons the USSR couldn't compete with the US during the Cold War. Wheat like many things in developing isn't equally distributed and is often exported rather than used for internal consumption.
 

Wrong. Wrong.Wrong. And wrong again.

Wikipedia is not reliable. Wrong there.

In that article, Pakistan is placed at 6th (not 5th), so wrong again.

Wheat is not a hugely important asset unless you are totally embargoed and dying, and have no means of growing own wheat or staple food. Various parts of the world grow their own wheat, and nobody has a lion's share of global production. Hence nobody dominates wheat production. Hence its importance in global markets is not so high. Wrong again.

USSR never collapsed because of wheat production (or lack thereof). This is the first time some one has even proposed such a ludicrous idea. Wrong again.

 
I read this in NewScientist and its well known that the medical industry in Sialkot is massive.
 

Apparently, that's all that you got. "I read that somewhere, and it's all well known." Sorry mate, show me a simple X-ray machine built in Pakistan (like I had earlier asked you to do).

 
1) Musharraf has never been my leader.
 

Pakistan's leader.

 
2) I never wanted Pakistan to join the War on Terror but neitheir do I want Pakistan to stand around whilst innocent people are being killed.
 

Pakistan betrayed the "Taliban", Taliban never started war on Pakistan.

 
3) I couldn't care less who "started" it while hospitals and schools are being bombed.
 

That's admission of "defeat" because you cared enough to blame them, to start a thread on them, Pakistan decided to involve in a bloody conflict with them that is bleeding Pakistan, that is stagnating your economy.

You couldn't care less because you have no other option.

Pakistan is a nation of cowards, so they followed their western masters' diktats.

 Bomb Pakistan back to stone age! 

Again.
 Bomb Pakistan back to stone age. 

 
You dodged the question:
 

What question was it?

There was none.

I didn't start this thread. You did. I posted some facts. You countered with your imagination and pseudo-facts gleaned from Paki newspapers which had some German "expert" diplomatically say Pakistan has potential.

 
I'm kinda sick of people saying that Pakistan tows the US line on everything. If that's so why hasn't the Pakistani army attacked North Waziristan, you know the place that NATO has been begging Pakistan to act upon for the last 9 years?
 

Nobody from outside the region cares about North Waziristan or whatever. Pakistan is a mess, that hits the headlines, nobody wants to visit Pakistan, its economy is going down the ****.

 Western biased source on GDP growth 

Not that I trust them a whole lot, as you can see, though they reduced Sudan's figures intentionally, Sudan outpaced China in the last 5 years (in reality, Sudan's figures are higher). I was of the impression taht Pakistan's GDP contracted though they showed something else here.

 
Military aid by the US is offered to Pakistan in order to enhance its capabilities, the US is trying to appease Pakistan by offering this aid.
 

Why would USA need to "appease" Pakistan? Why should USA be afraid of Pakistan?

It's the other way around. Pakistan is afraid and begs USA for its "services".

 Bomb Pakistan back to stone age!

2) You have no idea about foreign exchange.

As do you have no idea that they are insincere. You take from their enemies rather than listening to what they have to say about themselves and their mission.

Of course I will reject it, as per the verse in the Qur'aan, or is that verse 'not relevant in this day and age'?

Impartial media....I doubt that even most of the kuffar would ever call the media impartial in these issues. Everybody has their agenda to push.

Verify from the mouth of a muslim, not from a kaafir lest you cause harm to others and regret your actions.

No not everyone has a agenda and some media is impartial. I'll leave you with the same verse you posted:

O ye who believe! If a wicked person comes to you with any news, ascertain the truth, lest ye harm people unwittingly, and afterwards become full of repentance for what ye have done.

Verify the claims of the TTP using all sources and don't take things at face value.

I guess you have plenty of sources proving the Taliban were the angels as you describe them? Oh no it's because you're an extremist who doesn't mind a suicide bomber blowing himself in the middle of innocent people to kill ONE women whose crimes you can't prove.

Suck my balls, you're the one who said all British Muslims who don't leave should be liquidated so forgive me if I don't take your BS seriously.

If anyone sucks on the testicles of the Americans and needs their money to stay afloat, it's the whole of bloody Europe- if the Americans became isolationist and decided to only do minimal trade then its the European economy that will collapse- the Pakistanis would be kept going by the Chinese as they were before when sanctions were imposed.

Pakistan betrayed the Taliban? American military aid to the Mujahideen formed the basis of the Taliban regime- it's them who provided them with the means to take Kabul. It's the West which didn't condemn the regime and supported Saudi Arabia and Pakistan in trying to keep it going even when it was committing horrible atrocities and it was the West which then "betrayed" the people who initially it had sucked the balls of to drive the Soviets out of Afghanistan in the 1980's. NOT PAKISTAN.

Yes and well done you found the "Bomb back to the Stone Age" article, doesn't mean we have a crap military- it's actually very decent- just means the Americans were looking for our support and were so desperate they "threatened" us. And they have enough firepower to say that and then carry it out to almost any nation in the world including major powers like France and India so why should be embarrased they said it to us?

And lack of wheat imports actually WAS a big factor in causing the Soviet Union's collapse. When Reagan came into power he stopped almost all trade with the USSR, most of which consisted of wheat imports. The result was a hugely negative effect on the Soviet economy especially as Reagan encouraged all European and pro-Western nations as well not to purchase Soviet goods.

Mashallah, when Allah tells us to kill as little civilians as possible, you instead of suggesting maybe a sniper should have been used or something instead support the massacre of 120 people a lot of them children.

AND DON'T AVOID THE QUESTION: BRING ME PROOF THE TALIBAN WERE PEACEFUL ANGELS LIKE YOU DESCRIBE THEM BECAUSE THERE'S PLENTY OF PROOF FROM MUSLIM ORGANISATIONS THAT THEY WERE GENOICDAL MONSTERS.

More talk and no proof. Typical of a person afflicted by nationalism.

 

Funny how you refuse to answer all the questions I asked you. And having a bad mouth when arguing against kuffar who say the murder of children is permitted isn't as bad as the latter which you support in the context of Benazir's attempted assassination.

What stories? You have not linked us to anything. Furthermore, if you give me a news article which says that the TTP did this or that, I will reject it totally unless I see an official claim from them. Until then, I will follow Islaam and distrust the media of the enemies of Islaa.

O you who believe! If a rebellious evil person comes to you with a news, verify it, lest you harm people in ignorance, and afterwards you become regretful to what you have done.

 

HAHAHA and what media or other sources do you use when assessing the TTP?

She was an apostate.

Have you ever read the verses of the Qur'aan stating that WHOMSOEVER rules by other than what Allah revealed, they are THE Kaafirun.

And the verse stating that those who ally with the kuffar are disbelievers.

???

Same old story from you....disagreeing with somebody makes it permissable for you to speak filth.

Me? What has it got to do with me? If a sniper was possible then of course it is better, but I was not there surverying everything and planning things.

Genocidal monsters...lots of proof that the apostate pakistani army come under that title.

I posted you something weeks ago from journalists who decided to seek the turth about the Taliban...seems like you decided to ignore what it said. I'm not surprised....

Who said the murder of children is permitted? Another one of your lies.

Having a bad mouth is not permitted? Is that the law of shaytaan you are following there?

Ahh.. two more lies. Show me ANY proof AT ALL that the Pakistani army has committed genocide after joining the War on Terror.

And show me your (most likely) false journalist source as well because I definitely haven't seen it before.

You have supported a suicide bombing in which over 20 children were killed and thus you support the murder of children.

Funny, even when kuffar journalists go to Afghanistan to interview people who lived under the Taliban....it becomes most likely false because it contradicts your raging hatred for muslims.

I quoted you, and you failed to give a response.

Read it and stick your head in the sand again...

Typical sell out lapping up the stories of the kuffar even when muslims try to tell you what is really going on.

Go back on this thread, I posted the last mass bombing of civilians by your apostate army which was conveniently ignored here.

Keep supporting your apostate idol Bhutto and the apostate army.

Not only a filthy mouth but the worst logic I have ever come across.

Supporting the assassination of the apostate, does not mean I or anybody else supports the killing of children. For somebody to support that, they would have to make that their intention.

Oh I seeee so now when they serve YOUR purpose, it's fine to read the "biased kuffar" media outlets- I'am pretty sure you said they were unreliable haha   More lies I suppose.

And there are no interviews of ordinary Afghans in that article so more lies.

The bombing was an accident and as you convienently said accidents resulting in the death of innocents have happened even when great Muslim armies have been fighting (like at Qom).

Apostate: person who forsakes his religion, cause, party etc. Most soldiers in the Pakistani Army are religious Muslims and NOT fighting in the Northwest- the vast majority are still on the Indian border to protect the Muslims in Pakistan from the majority hindu Indian army.

Sooo MORE lies saying that the whole army consists of apostates. I really wish you'd join your murderous brothers and get killed before you can take part in the burning of schools, killing of female teachers etc. etc. like they do because its ***** like you who make sure people have a negative outlook of our great religion.

And I believe you just said: "Typical sell out lapping up the stories of the kuffar even when muslims try to tell you what is really going on."

THE NEWSPAPER YOU JUST QUOTED IS RUN BY AMERICAN CHRISTIANS SO IF I'AM DOING IT I'AM NOT THE BLOODY ONLY ONE LAPPING UP THE STORIES OF THE KUFFAR. I ACTUALLY GET MY STUFF FROM MUSLIM AID ORGANISATIONS WHILE YOU GET YOURS FROM SOURCES WHICH YOU YOURSELF SAY ARE UNRELIABLE.

Do......you......under...............staaaaaaand???????????????? ???????

Pakistan's security is threatened. It has huge potential but faces a tricky time now. Balochi separatists refuse to die down, the Pakistan Taleban has carried out many atrocities, including many daring attacks on Rawalpinidi, aka Garrison city, normally a safe city.

At least things with India are "ok" now.
 
 
So the TTP has claimed responsibility for the failed car bomb attack in New York which tells us two things:

1) The TTP target civilians and are not afraid to admit it unless of course there were army convoys in Times Square.  

2) The TTP has almost certainly made a false claim as it simply doesn't have the capability to strike New York.

 http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/8657606.stm 
 
 
Well it seems that Meshud is still alive as predicted last week. The US is saying that his authority has diminshed but they might just be saving face.

 
But last week Pakistani intelligence officials said they believed Mr Mehsud was only wounded - although his authority within the Taliban had diminished.

Claims by US and Pakistani officials that Hakimullah Mehsud had been killed always lacked credibility, the BBC's M Ilyas Khan says.

The Taliban has always denied his death but our correspondent says it is not known why it took them so long to issue such a video.
 

Indeed, why did take two months to issue a video. Anyways Meshud promises some attacks in the coming weeks in the US, we'll see if he's truthful.

O you who believe! If a rebellious evil person comes to you with a news, verify it, lest you harm people in ignorance, and afterwards you become regretful to what you have done.

Once again you expose where your allegiance lies. Even though everybody doubts these claims, you act as if they are a fact.

Futhermore, the Taliban denied this act, and said that they have no idea whos voice was in the video. So before you jump on the news from the kuffar, do a bit of research and take heed of the words of Allah.

 Pakistan Taliban deny New York car bomb claim. 

 "US authorities investigating the failed car bombing of New York's Times Square have dismissed the earlier claim of responsibility made over the internet by a group led by Qari Hussein Mehsud.

Pakistani Taliban sources also told Al Jazeera on Sunday that they were not involved."

The BBC article I linked to was last updated at 4 in the morning, all the articles you've linked to were last updated at noon today. There was a 6 hour intelligence gap. Also, what is the point of releasing a video then denying what was said in it? Two videos were released both caliming that the TTP were going to strike the US but the TTP (supposedly) denied one of them after claiming what was said in that very video a day earlier.

 
Intelcenter, a US-based group that monitors extremist websites, said its analysis indicated that the video was “credible” and that it had been issued by the TTP's media arm Umar Studio.

Another video allegedly issued by the TTP on Sunday claimed it was behind an attempted car bombing in New York's Times Square at the weekend, but US officials have dismissed the claims.

“There is no evidence that this is tied in with Al-Qaeda or any other big terrorist organisation,” New York mayor Michael Bloomberg said.

I know it is diffucult for you to understand, but try your hardest.

They did not create the video...that is why they denied it.

Secondly, I am linking you to news from the kuffar to point out that you are a hypocrite who exposes his agenda constantly.

You are happy to link peoploe to the most speculative news about this event, and then act as if it is fact, even drawing conclusions based upon these fairytales.

However, when the Taliban denies these acts, you fail to report it.

You prefer to choose the speculation if it makes them look bad; but when they speak for themselves, you stick your head in the sand.

Hell, even the US government said it has nothing to do with the TTP, but in your hatred for muslims you will find any way possible to pin it on them.

Maybe I didn't make myself clear. I didn't know that they had retracted their previous claim that they had made. Why? Because they retracted it after I had posted what I had. I made my conclusions based on what I had seen at that time from a credible source. I hadn't "failed" to report it as 1) I didn't know 2) I'm not a news source.

Nex point, there were two videos released, one claiming responsibility for teh failed attack and calling for further attacks on American soil and another one calling for attacks on American soil. The TTP denied the first but said nothing about the second, in other words they accept that they will attack the US on its soil.

And my last point, stop with these silly and hurtful accusations that you put in every post towards me. I mean "in your hatred for muslims you will find any way possible to pin it on them", you can't really be serious, I stated earlier that they couldn't carry out such attacks and I'm not even going to bother with "hatred for Muslims" bit.

You made conclusions based upon a speculative report that even the avowed enemies of Islaam said was highly unlikely.

Again, you ignore the verse of the Qur'aan and take the news of the kuffar as the haqq, and do not even have the brains to shut your mouth until something more concrete surfaces.

The first video was a random audio that has nothing to do with them. Later they released two videos, both proving Hakimullah Mehsud(ha) is alive, and threatening to attack America in the future. nowhere did they claim responsibility for the Times Square event.

Yes, you might have stated that they couldn't have carried them out, but you were happy to jump upon a speculative report and then conclude that the TTP had claimed responsibility for it.

EDIT: Get it clear in your head. They never RETRACTED any claims, because the initial claim of responsilibty was not even from them.

I wrote what I did based on what I knew which was based on a video released in the style of a TTP video at the same time other TTP videos where being released. It was hardly speculative because at the time, that particular video was taken to be authentic and wrote based on that. The US has said that they didn't carry out attack, they have yet to mention whether or not the TTP actaully made that claim.

The TTP never fail at such attacks; it couldn't have been them. The person who brought it up must have done it for political purposes. It happens.

I think the TTP might have done that, to show that they are still kicking but later retracted that claim due to a possible backlash from the US. Or maybe it was someone else trying to get a backlash.

More hypocrisy from you.

You wrote your lies based on a speculative news report which even the US governement was not willing to accept.

You need to learn the definition of what speculative.

Who cares what the USA said? The TTP themselves have denied that the earlier claim of responsilibty came from them. Funny how you are happy to believe the kuffar when they blame things on muslims; but when those very muslims themselves deny what is being said about them, you ignore it completely.

And finally, we do know that. They said themselves that the video was not from them. Why are you so willing to accept the reports accusing them, but not the reports where they are said to have denied the first claim...

O you who believe! If a rebellious evil person comes to you with a news, verify it, lest you harm people in ignorance, and afterwards you become regretful to what you have done.

And no one else has said that the video is not from them. They may have released it in error, it's not about for and against but about strength of evidence, against being a video for all to see and for being a statement denying what was in the video (although not totally).

What has this got to do with the times square incident?

Stay on-topic.

Also, whatever attack you are talking about on a hotel, show me a relevant article. Then show me an official claim from TTP regarding the alleged attacking, then I might have some idea of what you are raging on about.

There is ample proof in this thread that you clearly have no interest in being impartial or finding the truth of the matter, because you jump on anything attacking the TTP or the Taliban, but when the very same sources have something neutral or decent to say about them, suddenly they are unacceptable.

Furthermore...mistakes (that kill dozens of civilians) by the apostate army of pakistan are fine, but mistakes from the Taliban are purposeful murder of innocents....more hypocrisy.

Classic.

 http://english.aljazeera.net/news/as...598966998.html  No Americans hurt (they weren't involved in Iraq/Afghanistan anyways, just foreign workers) but 44 Muslims dead.

These, they have also admitted responsiblity for, you can find them admitting their role on any website you want:

The Tehreek-e-Nafaz-e-Shariate-Mohammadi (TNSM) claimed responsibility for a December 23, 2007 suicide bombing targeting a military convoy on behalf of the TTP. The blast in the Mingora area of the Swat Valley killed five soldiers and six civilians.

TTP claimed responsibility for the 23 July 2008 Swat Valley bombing.

TTP spokesman Maulvi Umar claimed that the group was responsible for August 21, 2008 suicide bomb attack on a military complex.

Abdur Rehman said TTP was behind a November 6, 2008 suicide bombing that targeted tribal elders, who had gathered in the Bajaur tribal area to discuss efforts to coordinate with the government against the Pakistani Taliban. The blast took the lives of 16 and injured 31.

In telephone interviews with news media Mehsud claimed responsibility for the March 30, 2009 attack on the police training academy in Lahore. He told the BBC that the attack was in retaliation for continued missile strikes from American drones for which the Pakistani government shared responsibility. In the same interview Mehsud claimed two other attacks: a March 25 attack on an Islamabad police station.

Azam Tariq, spokesman of the TTP, claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing at a security checkpoint along the Pakistan-Afghan border near Torkham on August 27, 2009. Tariq said by telephone that the attack was the first in retaliation for the death of Baitullah Mehsud. Although the exact number of casualties was unknown, a doctor at a nearby hospital told Dawn News that they had received 22 bodies and local people working at the blast site said they had retrieved 13 bodies.

Azam Tariq claimed responsibility for a suicide attack that killed five at the U.N.'s World Food Programme Islamabad offices on October 5, 2009.

The TTP, through Azam Tariq, claimed responsibility for the October 2009 attack on the army's headquarters at Rawalpindi. Tariq told the Associated Press that the attack was carried out by its "Punjabi faction" although the military insisted the attack originated in South Waziristan.

The militant group claimed responsibility for three separate coordinated attacks in Lahore. 10 militants targeted buildings used by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), the Manawan Police Training School and the Elite Police Academy.

MOST OF THESE ARE HARAM EVEN THOSE ON THE POLICE TRAINING CENTRES- THE POLICE KILLED WERE GOING TO BE DEPLOYED IN LAHORE, ISLAMABAD ETC. ANYWAYS AND NOT EVEN AGAINST THE TALIBAN. Even the attacks against the army were not in battle, the soldiers were not firing at them when they were blown up etc. etc.

Did I also mention: On January 21, 2009 the Taliban enforced a complete ban on female education in the Swat district. Some 400 private schools enrolling 40,000 girls were forced to close. At least 10 girls schools that tried to open after the January 15, 2009 deadline by the Fazlullah-led Taliban were destroyed by the militants in the town of Mingora. More than 170 were torched in the next 14 months.

There's proof on these on websites run by MUSLIMS, those run by NEUTRAL AID ORGANISATIONS, everywhere really but I suppose there's nothing that'll convince a kaafir like you intent on seeing people being blown up.

Out of interest did you support the 9/11 attacks?

Also, whatever attack you are talking about on a hotel, show me a relevant article. Then show me an official claim from TTP regarding the alleged attacking, then I might have some idea of what you are raging on about.

There is ample proof in this thread that you clearly have no interest in being impartial or finding the truth of the matter, because you jump on anything attacking the TTP or the Taliban, but when the very same sources have something neutral or decent to say about them, suddenly they are unacceptable.

Furthermore...mistakes (that kill dozens of civilians) by the apostate army of pakistan are fine, but mistakes from the Taliban are purposeful murder of innocents....more hypocrisy.

 

NO, THEY'RE NOT FINE. Again you lie because I never said that. They're tragic and whoever's actions resulted in them deserves to be punished. But the army isn't going after civilians, it's going after militant scum with the support of the public- even Al Jazeera says it has a huge amount of support in SWAT where people generally hate the Taliban.

I think you also believe Shias and Atheists deserve to die and its the duty of Muslims to ensure this? In that you live in a Western country so why just curious as to why you don't practise what you preach really....

Al Jazeera says....

Where? Source?

Do you even remember the reason why the Taliban entered Swat? Or have you wiped out of your mind the rally of thousands of muslims calling for the Shariah???
 
 
The taliban are nothing, muslims think that the taliban are some how going to over throw the world as we know it destroy capitalism and ensure islam is the worls religion

when in fact where ever there is a heavy influence of islam generally the country is as backward as ever

pakistan being a great example compared to say India

the quicker pakistanis stop hiding behind islam/prayers and start investing there resources into logic and reason and science the better off they will be

You'll find that Pakistan was well ahead of India for about 20-30 years after independence despite India inheriting the large majority of wealth. Most of India's boom has been in the last decade which is largely due to their PM and still isn't that far ahead.

Get a grip, its one of the largest armies in the world and one of the few that have develoed nuclear weapons. I don't know too much about this but even I'm well aware of joint and indigenously produced weapons.

It's not about equipment, I'll just let Inzy answer this but I'll like to point out that 9 years after invading Afghanistan the Wests best forces haven't finished off the Taliban.

 Secret Erik Prince (owner of Blackwater) Tape Exposed 

This might open the eyes of those who jump to blame everything on muslims.

" Prince spoke of Blackwater working in Pakistan, which appears to contradict the official, public Blackwater and US government line that Blackwater is not in Pakistan. "

Yet when the muslims deny certain attacks, and blame Blackwater, nobody has the time of day for them...

 Blackwater behind Pakistan bombings: Ex-intel chief.

I said before to those who support Pakistan that if you want to speak of Islam then by supporting the Pakistan government and army you lose absolutely all credibility by doing so. Ignoring Taliban for a moment and concentrating on your own position, it is unislamic, that is very clear. It is like a scholar eating a ham sandwich while sitting in front of another scholar and telling him he is wrong. Would you take him seriously?

So Blackwater is one sending suicide bombers into hospitals?

You do realise that the official line is not always reality? Officially Pakistan disproved the drone programme in the FATA but in reality it most probably supplied the intel. There are many in Pakistan who foolishly like to blame everything on the US including people in high office quoting one ex-intelligence officer doesn't change anything.

I don't blame everything on the USA.

But Prince himself admits he is in Pakistan, and that his group does covert operations for the USA in situations where using direct employees of the USA such as the military would be too dangerous.

Furthermore, the TTP have officially denied any involvement in some bombings and officially condemned them.

If we followed your logic that the TTP is a crazy bloodthirsty organization that will do anything including killing anybody and everybody in order to achieve their aims.....then they should be proud of such terrible actions. But quite the opposite, they are not, and in fact, the TTP and Al-Qa'eda made a joint video statement directly to the Pakistani people that they intended them no harm.

They stated that they fought the apostate army because it allied itself with the American kuffar and started operations against muslims. However, they said that their goal is not to harm any muslims.

The condemnation is nothing more than PR, how can you condem civilian deaths when you detonate a tonne of explosives in bazaars?

No I would not but as I said its the individual soldiers (MUSLIMS) in the Pakistani army who I support and I certainly don't support the organisation when it does wrong (like in 1971). Having read a lot about this from a lot of sources I just personally see the army as being better than the Taliban which is why they have the support of the ordinary people of Swat and Pakistan.

And to Sakujo and everyone else sorry if I don't reply I'm really busy with work at the moment.

This doesn't make sense. It is like someone saying they support the Nazi soldiers but not the Nazi army and state. The soldiers make up that army and state.

From the Islamic viewpoint the organisation is always enaged in wrong, its description is that it is wrong.

It baffles me how you and other Pakistanis offer your assumption of trust to a state that rules by Kufr, allows Kufr, allows the aggression of non Muslims into its borders, is highly cooperative with the enemies of this religion, seeks their aid and answers their orders, fights the mujahideen and on. It baffles me how you apply your trust in their favour and take their news, information, reports, propoganda when you are aware of the above.

It would be like me staying with the hypocrites/Jews of Madinah after the emigration of the Prophet. Supporting the Quraysh/Jews/hypocrites against the Prophet by believing in their news and information against the Prophet and approving of their actions against the Prophet and his companions and approving of their disobedience of the Prophet and his companions. In such a case what use is my declaration of Islam? When my actions are breaking, cutting, opposed to that declaration. When i am in an alliance with hypocrites and disbelievers of my own choice?

mate your chatting rubbish theres no war on muslims, its the fact that muslimc countries are so backward they dont know how to defend themselves and dont have the proper science base to create weapons

Every country gets picked on but if you cant defend yourself then what do you have,

the quicker muslim countries stop following islam and start using logic and reason the btter off they will be !!!

the better off the people will be and the better off the world will be

although its not our place to tell them what or how to live i f they want to invest all there resources into religion then they should be allowed to do so

but they cant turn around and complain when they are backward poor and havent got any famous scitentists engineers etc !!

No im not chatting rubbish.

I agree with you many Muslim majority lands are lacking. A good part of which is due to decades of Western meddling and interference.

 
the quicker muslim countries stop following islam and start using logic and reason the btter off they will be !!!
 

What and be more like U.S and U.K? Highest crime rates, self destructive and self obsessed, materialistic, over consuming, disrespectful, wasteful, irresponsible. With all of its endless problems and ills.

The quicker they actually start following Islam they quicker they will return to being the torchbearers and leaders of humanity as they once were.

 
the better off the people will be and the better off the world will be
 

The people will be better off when they stand up to the oppressive, tyrannical, useless, idiotic rulers who rule over them. When they stop aping your culture. When they rediscover their religion and throw off their tribalism and nationalism. When they stop bending as far as possible to foreign interests. When they take control of the natural resources within their borders.
When they show a will to excel, rather than live to trade, eat, consume, sleep and talk vanities etc.

 
although its not our place to tell them what or how to live i f they want to invest all there resources into religion then they should be allowed to do so

but they cant turn around anc omplain w when they are backward and pooor !!
 

Who is investing resources into religion?

Your comparison of the current Pakistani Army with the Nazis is actually beyond belief and our viewpoints are subjective. And as I said before I hate the current government but support the Army's operations. AND THIS IS THE REAL WORLD. What do you think will happen if the Pakistani army refuses to cooperate with the Americans, well last time they were hesitant the Americans threatened to bomb the country back to the Stone Age- something that would have killed millions of MUSLIMS.

You keep ranting on about how I have been taken in Western propaganda and how this has caused me to hate the Taliban (the nati-Islamic retards you call Mujahideen) and yet you refuse to listen again and again when I stress that my viewpoint comes from not only looking at the news but also reading the reports of human rights and aid organisations many of them Muslims. If you actually do research this and don't just listen like a sheep to what your Taliban buddies tell you, you'll find they have committed genocide while in power, committed suicide bombings which haven't targeted those specifically engaged against them (suicide is haram anyways) and much, much more.

Many armies threatened to wipe out the muslims when the religion was new, and the number of believers was low.

But, they were muslim so they believed in Allah and placed their trust upon Him and fought no matter what the numbers. They never made excuses even though they were likely to be wiped out.

Making alliances with the kuffar is kufr that expels one from the fold of Islaam. So there is no excuse for it, especially when you are fighting muslims:

Spoiler:

Allah (SWT) says:

“O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as Awliyaa’ (friends, protectors, helpers) they are but awliyaa’ of each other. And if any amongst you takes them (as awliyaa) then surely, he is one of them. Verily, Allah guides not those people who are the Zaalimoun (i.e. Kuffaar).” (EMQ al-Maa’idah, 5:51)

“O you who believe! Take not as (your) Bitaanah (advisors, consultants, protectors, helpers, friends, etc.) those outside your religion (pagans, Jews, Christians, and hypocrites) since they will not fail to do their best to corrupt you. They desire to harm you severely. Hatred has already appeared from their mouths, but what their breasts conceal is far worse. Indeed We have made plain to you the Aayaat (proofs, evidences, verses) if you understand.” (EMQ Aali-‘Imraan, 3:118)

Shaykh Sulayman ibn ‘Abdillah al-ash-Shaykh said commenting on this Ayah: “Hence, the Glorified and Exalted forbade the believers from taking the Jews and Christians as allies and He has informed (them) that whoever from the believers allies himself with them then he is from them. Similar to this is the ruling for the one who allies himself with the Kuffar from the Majus and idol worshippers, they are from them.” (ad-Durrar as-Sanniyyah 8/127)

“O you who believe! Take not for allies those who take your religion for a mockery and fun from among those who received the Scripture before you, nor from among the disbelievers; and fear Allah if you indeed are believers. (al-Ma’idah 5/57)

Shaykh ‘Abdul-Latif ibn ‘Abdir-Rahman al-ash-Shaykh (rahimahullah) said: “So contemplate the words of the Most High: And fear Allah if you are indeed believers. This particle, which is the conditional.. that necessitates negating its condition if the response is removed. What this means is: Whoever took them as allies is not a believer.” (ad-Durrar as-Sanniyah 8/288)

Soldiers who fight in the armies of the idolic goverenments (Taghut) these days, whether it be the Yemeni army or others, have fallen into disbelief, and there is no difference of opinion amongst the scholars in this matter, and here I mean those scholars who follow the Salaf, for two main reasons:

1 – By his actions he is defending and protecting unislamic constitutions, and by this he is endorsing kufr.

2 – He has allied with the idolic governments (taghut) who are the enemies of Allah. Allah has said:

« الذين ءامنوا يقاتلون في سبيل الله والذين كفروا يقاتلون في سبيل الطاغوت »

“Those who believe fight in the way of Allah; and those who disbelieve fight in the way of Taghut…” (Al-Nisaa:76)

The Qur'aan is not a book which you can pick and choose from, and then ignore the practical reality of what a verse implies.

In October 2009, the U.S. Congress approved $7.5 billion of non-military aid to Pakistan over the next five years. In February 2010, U.S. President Barack Obama sought to increase funds to Pakistan to "promote economic and political stability in strategically important regions where the United States has special security interests".

Slaves much?

You need to be taught what Islaam is and what a muslim is defined as, then you will actually be able to understand this one verse (which is blindingly obvious anyway):

O you who believe! if an evil-doer comes to you with a report, look carefully into it, lest you harm a people in ignorance, then be sorry for what you have done.[49;6]

Once you can understand it, you might begin to take your information from somewhere decent, and then possibly open your eyes to the truth. The real sheep (and fool) is the one who swallows the words of the kuffar and believes their word against a muslim's word.

The subject is a theology subject but its also an international affairs subject. We're discussing theology and international affairs just like there are other threads discussing two seperate things. E.g. a thread in Social and Cultural related to that and Theology. Secondly this seems to be a good place to discuss the Pakistan army.

Making alliances with the kuffar is kufr that expels one from the fold of Islaam. So there is no excuse for it, especially when you are fighting muslims:

Spoiler:

Allah (SWT) says:

“O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as Awliyaa’ (friends, protectors, helpers) they are but awliyaa’ of each other. And if any amongst you takes them (as awliyaa) then surely, he is one of them. Verily, Allah guides not those people who are the Zaalimoun (i.e. Kuffaar).” (EMQ al-Maa’idah, 5:51)

“O you who believe! Take not as (your) Bitaanah (advisors, consultants, protectors, helpers, friends, etc.) those outside your religion (pagans, Jews, Christians, and hypocrites) since they will not fail to do their best to corrupt you. They desire to harm you severely. Hatred has already appeared from their mouths, but what their breasts conceal is far worse. Indeed We have made plain to you the Aayaat (proofs, evidences, verses) if you understand.” (EMQ Aali-‘Imraan, 3:118)

Shaykh Sulayman ibn ‘Abdillah al-ash-Shaykh said commenting on this Ayah: “Hence, the Glorified and Exalted forbade the believers from taking the Jews and Christians as allies and He has informed (them) that whoever from the believers allies himself with them then he is from them. Similar to this is the ruling for the one who allies himself with the Kuffar from the Majus and idol worshippers, they are from them.” (ad-Durrar as-Sanniyyah 8/127)

“O you who believe! Take not for allies those who take your religion for a mockery and fun from among those who received the Scripture before you, nor from among the disbelievers; and fear Allah if you indeed are believers. (al-Ma’idah 5/57)

Shaykh ‘Abdul-Latif ibn ‘Abdir-Rahman al-ash-Shaykh (rahimahullah) said: “So contemplate the words of the Most High: And fear Allah if you are indeed believers. This particle, which is the conditional.. that necessitates negating its condition if the response is removed. What this means is: Whoever took them as allies is not a believer.” (ad-Durrar as-Sanniyah 8/288)

Soldiers who fight in the armies of the idolic goverenments (Taghut) these days, whether it be the Yemeni army or others, have fallen into disbelief, and there is no difference of opinion amongst the scholars in this matter, and here I mean those scholars who follow the Salaf, for two main reasons:

1 – By his actions he is defending and protecting unislamic constitutions, and by this he is endorsing kufr.

2 – He has allied with the idolic governments (taghut) who are the enemies of Allah. Allah has said:

« الذين ءامنوا يقاتلون في سبيل الله والذين كفروا يقاتلون في سبيل الطاغوت »

“Those who believe fight in the way of Allah; and those who disbelieve fight in the way of Taghut…” (Al-Nisaa:76)

The Qur'aan is not a book which you can pick and choose from, and then ignore the practical reality of what a verse implies.

In October 2009, the U.S. Congress approved $7.5 billion of non-military aid to Pakistan over the next five years. In February 2010, U.S. President Barack Obama sought to increase funds to Pakistan to "promote economic and political stability in strategically important regions where the United States has special security interests".

Slaves much?

You need to be taught what Islaam is and what a muslim is defined as, then you will actually be able to understand this one verse (which is blindingly obvious anyway):

O you who believe! if an evil-doer comes to you with a report, look carefully into it, lest you harm a people in ignorance, then be sorry for what you have done.[49;6]

Once you can understand it, you might begin to take your information from somewhere decent, and then possibly open your eyes to the truth. The real sheep (and fool) is the one who swallows the words of the kuffar and believes their word against a muslim's word.

 

This isn't 600 AD- we're not fighting with swords. An American nuclear attack would have wiped out 170m Muslims (I know you support bombers blowing themselves in crowds of Muslims but thats a bit far...) Without the alliance millions more WOULD have died.

And I have said it before you're the one who supports the Kufr Taliban (as proven by Muslim and neutral aid and human right organisations) and the Pakistani Army is much, much better than those scum which is why most people in Swat hated the Taliban and support the army.

It's time to open YOUR eyes and realise that there will not be an Islamic Caliphate and that the armies and the governments of separate countries have a duty to protect their civilians- Sharia simply can't be implemented in most Muslim countries because too many people oppose the forms of Sharia that its supporters wish to enforce.

And let me ask you this NOW: Do you believe that Shias deserve death? AND Do you believe atheists deserve death?

No its because the Taliban epitomise Kufr and the Pakistan Army has now defeated them. I wonder why Allah decided to help the army and not your kaafir suicide bomber scum??

See above, also be wary of making takfir on anyone.
 
 
you still keep sticking and thinking that allah, mohammed, muslim,islam,. reliogion will help you solve your probolems

and if we are going to go down this route, western armies are better equiped far more advanced and DOMINATE the miltary world

not because they follow islam,mohammed,allah,religion etc but because the follow logic and reason

i said this before if you want to be a world player like the UK, USA, Germany etc you will have to stop investing time and resources into religion/mohammed/islam etc

its getting the muslimw orld absolutely no where

israel vs the middle east being a prime example of where islam has failed
 
 
just to add comment sharia law is backward and designed for years and years ago

most muslims wouldnt want sharia law, and how would sharia law deal with complex tax cases, it simply cant

this idea of a muslim caliphate is backward wrong, the west will never let it happen ( eg when saddam invade kuwait etc) the muslim world will never be powerful enough to impliment any kind of army force as they get all there weapons from america etc

as above the quicker muslims forget islam and start using logic and reason the better off they will be

because so far islam is getting them nowhere

To prevent you going wildly off course, just answer the simple questions, because some of the things you say are bordering on being moronic.

How do they epitomise kufr?

What did they do, and what ruling does it fall under?

This is how you see things working? You actually believe that Allah is helping the army? Were you informed of that?

If we follow your false logic then tell me, is Allah helping the Shias in Iran, and Iraaq? Is Allah also helping the apostate governments stay in power?

Do you assume Allah is helping these people because their cause is being successful in the short-term?

In any case, your belief that the apostate army is successful is funny, there are even reports that the TTP is beginning to move back into Swat...

And now we know, let alone NOT killing Hakimullah Mehsud, you didn't even put a scratch upon him!

Some successes!

lol, OK wake me up when your Taliban buddies take over and start blowing Pakistan up. Muslim aid organisaton reports have proved the Taliban to be un-Islamic so have those of neutral organisations like Amnesty etc. The only proof you could find of their goodness was an article written by the Americans in the LA times hahahah.

And do you think that Shias and atheists deserve death or not? Funny how you avoid the question.
 
 
Okay bringing this thread back on topic:

 http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/...wn+time--bi-03 

No firm word on North Warizistan as of yet.

Found this opinion quite interesting:

 
It is, however, in Pakistan that some sections of the ulema think that killing our own people is a justified way of expressing dissent against the government’s policies.

Mind you, the government’s perceived pro-American policies do not have opponents merely in the religious right. Even liberal sections of opinion — the recently formed Workers Party Pakistan, for instance — are sharply critical of a continuation of Pervez Musharraf’s war on terror by the PPP-led government. But none of these political parties and elements has justified blasts in Moon market or the blowing up of mosques or a girls’ university to register their protest against the government’s foreign policy.

The religious touch to the ulema’s anti-Americanism is laughable. Just the other day, they were head over heels in love with America, and any opposition to the CIA’s overt and covert operations in Afghanistan was considered heresy because there existed an “indissoluble unity” among the People of the Books.

The ulema know the hurmat Islam attaches to human life. In case some of them have forgotten, the blast in the Rawalpindi Askari mosque on Dec 4 last killed, among others, 16 children.
 
 
 
 Pakistan soldiers killed in Taliban clashes in Orakzai 

Few more napak army apostates dispatched!

 Pakistan faces Taliban resurgence. 

So much for the napak army offensive.

"Once again the Pakistani Taliban have begun to murder local leaders, intimidate the population, pose a risk to the security forces, prevent development projects and threaten wider violence."

And you support this?
 
 
the taliban are nothing to do with islam, they simplyu use islam to brain wash and for some reason muslims believe it is a good idea to blow themselves up... and this seems exclusvie to islam, ive yet to see christians,jews,hindus,sikhsetc !!!

i say it again the quicker pakistan gets rid of islam and uses logic and reason and the quicker they get rid of the taliban who the better off they will all be
 
 
They're going to be able to resurge as long as the Pakistani government doesn't build the necessary infrastructure and the CIA keep whipping up public outrage with drone attacks.

 
Heavily-armed militants drive through villages on motorbikes to intimidate the population, burn down girls schools and threaten anyone co-operating with the army - often in plain sight of police or army sentries.
 

The army and police can't do anything until they have the necessary resources. Plus the army themselves aren't trained in COIN and so treat this like regular warfare.

The Tamil Tigers have used suicide bombers. The fact of the matter is that the militants in the wider region don't have the resources to engage in regular fighting and so have to use terrorist tactics. Religion acts as a justification for teh act rather than a motivator in this case. That's why you don't see the Pakistani army engaging in suicide bombing despite the obvious religious overtones througout its whole establishment.

but then why is it muslims that predominantly blow themselves up

IRA didnt, ETA (Spanish organisation) dont

the fact is if they didnt blow themselevs up and invest there resources into religion then they would be alot stronger

Tamil Tigers were made up of Christians, Buddhists and Hindus. No religious element to it, tamils here who support them come from many different faiths. This land based war in S Lanka bares similarity to many past historical events.

And the Pakistani army don't need to blow themselves up because they have in the past financed militant groups, in other words, get angry young muslims to do their dirty work.

Now we are seeing the Pak Taleban fighting their former partner, the ISI. Global Jihad is more of a problem.
 
 
So getting this thread back on track:

 http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/...e-taking-qs-14 

Around 70 people taken hostage by militants dressed as police, I wonder what the motive was.

Well, it wasn't religious in the sense that they were using scriptures to justify their actions. It may have been religious in the sense they had an unhealthy devotion to their leader who was seen almost an idol.

It is similar to Muslim Suicide bombing in the sense that they had to be bombarded with propaganda over an extensive period of time to make them believe that killing themselves for a Tamil homeland was a justified cause.

Apparently just another case of Shia - Sunni violence.

I just don't get the state of denial/head in the sand response from Pakistan. Anything which asscoiates the state/Islam in a negative way is either seen as non existant, or a massive conspiracy by India/USA/Israel.

You read about the NY Bomber - apparently a US conspiracy to defelct from Oil Spill, or an excuse to attack Pakistan. The Mumbai attacks - Indian conspiracy to defame Pakistan. The Pakistani Taliban idiots being paid by Indians, or no wait, they are non-muslims, and in fact they are Indians. It's just ridiculous!
