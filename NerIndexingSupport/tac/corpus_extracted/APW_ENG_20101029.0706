Only hours after touching down in London, two Denver Broncos were already getting their first taste of British culture at one of England's most famous cricket venues.

The Broncos arrived Friday for their regular-season NFL game against the San Francisco 49ers at Wembley Stadium on Sunday. Their opening practice was at The Oval, a well-known cricket ground south of the River Thames.

But before getting down to business on the football field, offensive lineman Chris Kuper and tight end Daniel Graham each took swings with a cricket bat, hitting the ball around the gridiron-lined stadium.

Kuper, who traded gifts and stories with a pair of Surrey County cricketers, says "it was cool."
