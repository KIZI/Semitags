The United Nations' Somalia Conference opened here on Saturday.

UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Somali President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed
and delegates from 55 countries attended the conference.

The UN chief made a speech at the opening ceremony. He said, " Somali pirates
are one of the world's greatest crisis."

Speaking about the conference, he said, "This is a clear sign of our commitment
and solidarity with the people of Somalia at a time when they need our support."

"This is another sign of Turkey's willingness to take up the most serious
international problems," he added.

The UN chief noted the conference is held to help the Republic of Somalia to
develop, and there have been regional and international efforts to reverse the
situation.

However, he said the efforts made for Somalia have been inadequate by far.

Somali President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, during his address to the
conference, said "In Somalia, we have great challenge of resources. The economy
of Somalia has collapsed."

He said the continuation of war in Somalia has inflicted heavy losses on the
society and made people displaced.

"Another issue is piracy ... we need the international support, " he added.

The Somalia Conference seeks to address issues of "security, political
cooperation and rebuilding and development" as part of the Djibouti Peace
Process outlined in the 2008 Djibouti Peace Accord, according to an official
from the Turkish Foreign Ministry.

The UN aims for the conference to address the decisions taken by the Somalian
International Contact Group during their December 2009 meeting in Jeddah and
remain within the framework of the Djibouti Peace Process. It also anticipates
the acceptance of an Istanbul Declaration regarding Somalia.

Twelve international organizations, including the Organization of the Islamic
Conference, are among the attendance.
