Any pointers on how to treat the outcome of a merger?

I owned (long term) shares of GSF, which merged with Transocean (RIG),
resulting in shares of RIG plus some cash.

Can anyone offer pointers on how to treat the transaction from a tax
standpoint?  How do I determine:

1) How much of the cash is capital gain?

2) What's my basis in the new stock?

(I really ought to have stayed on top of this, selling off the stock
before the transaction took place!)

Not only pointers, but exact instructions.

You'll find them in the paperwork that you ignored during the merger
process.  In that paperwork you'll find the information about the tax
treatment of the transaction for shareholders of both corporations.

If you can't find your copy, investor relations at the surviving company
should be able to help.
