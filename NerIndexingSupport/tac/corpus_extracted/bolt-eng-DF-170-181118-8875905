It's clear from the wildly enthusiastic response from the troops this morning that President Obama is a source of inspiration and hope for members of the US military. The beloved President's remarks were repeatedly interrupted by wild cheering from the troops. Who can blame them? He's ending a bloody, needless Republican war and is saving tens of thousands of lives and billions and billions of dollars in the process. God bless him.

BAGHDAD—Members of the U.S. Armed Forces were reportedly overcome with feelings of joy, nostalgia, and optimism this week after learning they would soon be withdrawn from Iraq and allowed to finally return home to Afghanistan.

"I never thought this day would come," said Cpl. Douglas Robinson, who hasn't seen the barren hills and smoking craters of his beloved Kabul in nearly six years. "Being away from those you left behind, for this long, it definitely starts to take a toll on you."

The amber waves of blowing sand and rubble.

Added Robinson, "I can't believe I'm going home again."

In 2003, thousands of American soldiers were unexpectedly uprooted from Afghanistan and sent off to fight in a long and bloody war overseas. After serving multiple tours of duty in Iraq, the vast majority of these troops said they couldn't wait to get back and have their lives return to normal.

"It's going to be great to be surrounded by all those familiar faces again," said Pfc. Shawn Brunner, staring wistfully at an old and faded photograph of the bleak wasteland. "The tribal sheiks, the frightened villagers, all that wonderful rubble near the Id Gah Mosque. When I'm finally back on Afghan soil, I'll probably kiss the ground."

You right wing fucking hypocrite pussies. Seriously?

Afganistan is the war we should be fighting.

I wonder if we would have won already had Bush not spread us too thin by starting the Iraq war before the Afgan war was finished?

Do you still want to capture or kill Bin Ladin? Or like Bush, do you not think about him that seriously.

But I swear to god, you god damn cock sucking Republicans are going to now start playing politics with Afganistan? Stop it! For the sake of the troops. LOL.

But seriously, your fuckng party was in charge on 9-11 and you got attacked, and then 8 years later you didn't capture Bin Ladin? You should be a fucking shamed of yourselves.

And you should never have the fucking balls to bring up Afganistan. If you bring up Afganistan, you automatically lose the arguement, because if anything, Afgan is the shining example of what a failure you and your party are.

Seriously, you Republicans are treasonist. I'd fight against you all in a new Civil War. I don't want anything to do with you fucking losers anymore.

We'll take Pittsburg, Philly, NY, Chicago, California, Detroit, Boston, etc. We'll take every city/state that makes America great, and you can keep the fucking hillbilly states.

Then you can elect what ever dumb fuck you want and you can get hit on 9-11 every year. Fucking weak ass GOP.

No wonder their voters are dumb as fuck.

Wrong. Troops are forced to cheer, like him or not. I can't imagine many that would be given his world apology tour.

He's not ending shit. Open your eyes, partisan hack.

He was already what he loathes. So much so he can't deal with reality. A one way sign is more objective than sillyblahblah, or the original poster for that matter.

These are the kind of idiots the Democratic party signs up to vote.
 
 
Well now DBrod, it seems you have made your way here after all. I had my hopes up you might be on your way to free room and board in Kansas, courtesy of the feds. Regardless, you will find just as many anti everything weirdos here, as we had before. They are just as wild with their accusations without any supporting proof other than their weak personal opinion. Consequently, you should fit right in.

Aww the little leftistas are having a circle jerk because the "Onion" and CNN say so.

Funny, but when I ask the troops I know, I hear the real story, they didn't vote for him/it and are getting out as soon as their time is over.
 
 
Dbrod! Welcome! Glad you made it over here.

I can't believe you broke the rules with your very first post!  

Not!  
 
 
HAHAHA! Thanks, Cracky. Sad the AOL board shut down, but it had become like the RNC...freaks everywhere.

I seem to recall that when the troops cheered for G.W., you on the left claimed that they had been forced! That it was all a big dog and pony show.

Why would it be different now? If I was still in the service, I'd want to be photographed with the Commander in Chief no matter who it was or whether I liked him or not. I'd try to get him to sign my performance report too! You're set for life when the Prez does that.

Facts are irrelevant to these Looney Librons. When the troops cheered Bush it was all just for show but when they cheer Obama, aka POS they are sincere? What a joke. As if these loons actually expect anybody to believe this crap. This Libron has been spewing this same nonsense from the beginning without a shred of proof. The only thing that might be minutely truthful from DBrod is, she belongs in a cell in Kansas.

Don't know about where DBrod belongs, but I suspect you are correct. Here basless assertions are absurd though. I used to have to stand in those rent-a-crowd formations. They ARE bullshit dog and pony shows and the military is a captive audience. It doesn't matter WHO is President.

Forced to cheer???? How??? At gunpoint??? It appeared that was the case when Bush showed up but I watched Obama speaking in front of the troops a few minutes ago and they were whoopin and hollarin and it was clearly spontaneous. He was getting interupted constantly with the crowd noise. Sorry Gunny I know you got medals on your medals but your take on this is wrong. Better clean your sights.
 
 
I guess they (the troops) were also forced to take fotographes of him. I agree with huggy, not all troops were cheering btw (wich would have been the case if they were forced to do so).

My sights are fine. Might want to take the dustcover off yours and allow the light and world into yours.

And here we go with the twisted, dishonest arguments. People like you and huggy require more effort than you rate.

IF, the troops were forced to participate as units, they were also prompted to cheer. That's how it is, doesn't matter who YOU agree with.

IF participation was voluntary, then only the troops that support Obama are going to show up and of course those sheep are going to cheer. Everyone else is going to sleep, eat, or red and write letters home.

I was forced to participate in enough of that shit that I have a clue. I don't recall what ship it was, but when Clinton first took office they arranged a rent-a-crowd for him and two of the Sailors said fuck that and fuck him. They were give nonjudicial punishment for it. It sends a message if you give an ounce of a damn about your rank and pay.

Wake up. This is an all-volunteer force. They don't want to hear some mealy-mouthed asshole apologizing for the US.

Prove me wrong. Lay off the kool aid and go enlist. After you've walked a mile in my combat boots, you can tell me what it's all about.

Whoa there Gunny. You sayin this thread is off limits to all but retired veterans? I know what I've seen and heard and don't come here making false reports. I'll defer to you on the back story. Question? Have you seen the recent Obama meeting the Iraq troops clips or are you assuming its all bs based on past experience.

You are right that my experience with military affairs is limited. I once put on a concert at Fort Lewis for the troops featuring Earth Wind and Fire. That was about the extent of my personal involvement with the military... Well there was one "incident" when a couple of Phantoms pulled up alongside while I was flying in the Carribean.

Is that your best strawman? I said nothing of the sort, as you are well aware. I did not this thread is off limits to all but retired veterans, nor did I say anything was BS except the original post; which, is about as one-sided, kool-aid-drinking, wishful thinking, leftwingnut bullshit as it gets. Nothing but partisan sensationalism, and THAT is what I am arguing against.

Some troops showed up and cheered for Obama. Big fucking deal. Some troops showed up and cheered for Bush, Clinton, Bush I, and Reagan as well. Hell, I've seen them cheer for Darth Cheney. Need I say more than my last?

I just didn't drip enough sarcasm on my post!
 
 
You ever think that they are applauding the position and not the person. They may or may not like him - but the fact that their Commander-in-Chief was there (and their superior officers telling them to "whoop it up"), was probably enough for the display.

What did I tell you guys last year? I told you the military vote would go to Obama. You all mocked me as if the thought was absurd.

A military guy was on the Ed Schultz show and he said they make a point not to talk against the current commander & chief, but almost all of them went DEMOCRAT.

Block the Absentee vote? Maybe this should be moved to the Conspiracy Theories?  

 OpenSecrets | Troops Deployed Abroad Give 6:1 to Obama - Capital Eye 

Troops prefer Obama 6 to 1.

Thats total bullshit unless your telling me that the ratio between races is 6to 1 black the only reason Obow man was elected is because he is Black
 
 
Some military personal do like Obama, I just had the oppurtunity to sit next to a woman in the National Guard. We were traveling throught the Atlanta airport. I asked her what she thought, she said she liked Obama. She also told me Obama gave them a raise. I had to point out he is cutting military spending and that he specifically stated that Obama wants to enlarge Americorp to over 250,000 people and to make them, "as well funded, and as powerful as the military". Obama's exact words. This National Guard soldier was surprised and said she will have to look that up. She was deeply concerned that this is true.
 
 
Well you non-military people. Do you have any idea what consequences would come from even attempting to show a lack of support for the President would bring? Of course you don't because you have never been in the military. The only change we got in this election was location. Our orders are being diverted from Iraq to Afganistan. We are still deploying we will still be at war and you will still see one moe surge in Iraq. Obama talks about the removal of combat troops by 2010 when in reality none of the soldiers in Iraq are combat troops because we are on a peace keeping mission and training soldiers. So even if Obama doesn't decrease troop strength by one soldier he has kept his word. Way to vote America Way to vote.
 
 
 
 
 
Nah. They'll be "hostile" again come election time.

 

What did I tell you guys last year? I told you the military vote would go to Obama. You all mocked me as if the thought was absurd.

A military guy was on the Ed Schultz show and he said they make a point not to talk against the current commander & chief, but almost all of them went DEMOCRAT.

Block the Absentee vote? Maybe this should be moved to the Conspiracy Theories?  

 OpenSecrets | Troops Deployed Abroad Give 6:1 to Obama - Capital Eye 

Troops prefer Obama 6 to 1.

 

Thats total bullshit unless your telling me that the ratio between races is 6to 1 black the only reason Obow man was elected is because he is Black

RUSH: These people are racists. You know, the racists in our society, Ted, are these white liberals. They're the ones that notice your skin color before anything else
 
 
 
Aww the little leftistas are having a circle jerk because the "Onion" and CNN say so.

Funny, but when I ask the troops I know, I hear the real story, they didn't vote for him /it and are getting out as soon as their time is over.

Dehumanization

Dehumanization is a psychological process whereby opponents view each other as less than human and thus not deserving of moral consideration.

The Psychology of Dehumanization

Dehumanization is actually an extension of a less intense process of developing an "enemy image" of the opponent. During the course of protracted conflict, feelings of anger, fear, and distrust shape the way that the parties perceive each other. Adversarial attitudes and perceptions develop and parties begin to attribute negative traits to their opponent. They may come to view the opponent as an evil enemy, deficient in moral virtue, or as a dangerous, warlike monster.

An enemy image is a negative stereotype through which the opposing group is viewed as evil, in contrast to one's own side, which is seen as good. Such images can stem from a desire for group identity and a need to contrast the distinctive attributes and virtues of one's own group with the vices of the "outside" group.[4] In some cases, evil-ruler enemy images form. While ordinary group members are regarded as neutral, or perhaps even innocent, their leaders are viewed as hideous monsters.[5]
Enemy images are usually black and white. The negative actions of one's opponent are thought to reflect their fundamental evil nature, traits, or motives.[6] One's own faults, as well as the values and motivations behind the actions of one's opponent, are usually discounted, denied, or ignored. It becomes difficult to empathize or see where one's opponent is coming from. Meaningful communication is unlikely, and it becomes difficult to perceive any common ground.
Once formed, enemy images tend to resist change, and serve to perpetuate and intensify the conflict. Because the adversary has come to be viewed as a "diabolical enemy," the conflict is framed as a war between good and evil.[7] Once the parties have framed the conflict in this way, their positions become more rigid. In some cases, zero-sum thinking develops as parties come to believe that they must either secure their own victory, or face defeat. New goals to punish or destroy the opponent arise, and in some cases more militant leadership comes into power.
Enemy images are accentuated, according to psychologists, by the process of "projection," in which people "project" their own faults onto their opponents. This means that people or groups who tend to be aggressive or selfish are likely to attribute those traits to their opponents, but not to themselves. This improves one's own self-image and increases group cohesion, but it also escalates the conflict and makes it easier to dehumanize the other side.

Deindividuation facilitates dehumanization as well. This is the psychological process whereby a person is seen as a member of a category or group rather than as an individual. Because people who are deindividuated seem less than fully human, they are viewed as less protected by social norms against aggression than those who are individuated.[8] It then becomes easier to rationalize contentious moves or severe actions taken against one's opponents.
 
 
 
 
 
Wrong. Troops are forced to cheer, like him or not. I can't imagine many that would be given his world apology tour.

He's not ending shit. Open your eyes, partisan hack.

 

Forced to cheer???? How??? At gunpoint??? It appeared that was the case when Bush showed up but I watched Obama speaking in front of the troops a few minutes ago and they were whoopin and hollarin and it was clearly spontaneous. He was getting interupted constantly with the crowd noise. Sorry Gunny I know you got medals on your medals but your take on this is wrong. Better clean your sights.

 

The troops will show respect for the office in public. But when you talk to any Vet from Iraq or Afgan. they despise the Bow Man.
I know I've talked to some how about you ?? You know shit about the Military fuckhead

 

I've got one word that kills your whole argument that Obama is not more popular than Bush with the troops. Bush was despised by many troops.

STOPLOSS

That one word your precious Bush coined has accounted for thousands of military families breaking up, losing thier stateside jobs(in the cases of national gaurds) and therefore losing thier homes and in many cases suicides.

You can spin it any way you want but I don't have to be in the military to figure out this.
 
 
 
 
What did I tell you guys last year? I told you the military vote would go to Obama.

 

No one knows if it did or not. That's the point, the military absentee ballots were disqualified.

Didn't you know? Of course not.

 

Show me an article that the Democrats did this. First of all, who did we target? Predominently white military men? Because we know that the GOP caged black military voters. What do you say about that? You sir are probably lying.

Sometimes vote suppression is as important in this business as vote-getting.
- Carl Golden, Republican Campaign Spokesperson [1]

Caging is a direct mail technique used to clean up a mailing list. A political organization sends first class mail to a list of voters (or donors) marked do not forward. Sometimes, the mail is sent return receipt requested. Voters whose mail comes back undeliverable, or who do not return the receipt, are removed from the list  caged, in direct mail parlance.

Vote caging is when a political organization, typically a political party, compiles a caging list of voters whose mail came back undeliverable or who did not return the receipt, and uses that list to challenge those voters as not being validly registered. The challenges can occur prior to Election Day or at the polls.

The problem with using a caging list to challenge voters is simple. First, the list is most often produced using criteria aimed at a particular racial group (picking out African-American precincts, for example). Second, there are plenty of reasons why mail sent to a validly registered voter might be returned as undeliverable or without the signed return receipt requested. For instance, the voter may be serving abroad in the military or away at college.

Yes, I heard that military people were keeping hush hush until after the election, but now, they can say that they are THRILLED Obama is the new Commander & Chief.

I proved to my co-worker that McCain voted against the military 80% of the time and Obama voted with them 80% of the time, and that news got over to Afganistan.

I think it is funny that you right wing idiots are so sure that the GOP owned the militiary vote, but now you see that the military donated 6 to 1 for Obama over McCain.

If that isn't enough proof, you are idiots..

I agree. No fucking way the military voted for McCain, UNLESS they are not told the truth.

Like remember McCain voted against Webb's veteran's bill and the next day Bush praised Webb & MCCAIN   for drafting it?

Remember that military guy got up and argued with McCain at one of his town hall meetings over his record with veterans groups? McCain said he got all A's but the veteran had all the facts. McCain only got C's.

Most of the commanders are probably right wingers. And we know Bush politicized the military, so we know it is run by all right wingers.

But I don't know about the troops. Maybe before when there were more whites in the service, but what is the ratio now?

Anyways, I think you are right. Bush clearly shit on the troops for 6 years and they came home enough times to know what was really going on.

And with the internet, its a lot harder to hide the truth from the troops.

And I heard from a military wife that the troops LOVE Obama!

That was after last week when the GOP tried to suggest Obama hand picked the troops that greeded him in Iraq.

The GOP did that shit for 8 years. Not one real question from one real person. It was all staged. "Mr, President, I have a question, why are you being picked on so much by the liberal media"?

Real hard hitting questions.

You'd have to prove that to me bobo. Just because people donated more money to the Obama campaign it doesn't mean more people voted for him it means the people who voted for Obama tended to give more to the campaign. Fallacy of composition association as causation.

No!   For years I accepted that the GOP always won the military vote. YEARS!!!

For the first time I'm calling BULLSHIT!!!!

6 to 1 dude!!!! 6 to 1!!!!

And word has it, they all love Obama. They just kept quiet until after the election.

And I am hearing it from the troops on the ground buddy. They know McCain was a traitor.

I just don't get McCain. The McCain in 2000 would have won. And in 2008, he would have won the right wing because he was always the lesser of two evils. McCain needed to cater to the middle. I know people argue that, but just look at the results.

McCain voted against the troops 80/20. I know for a fact this news got to Afganistan, because I am the one who spread it. The father of the soldier didn't believe me, so I showed him, and the next week he said he emailed the story to his son in Afganistan and they were furious with McCain.

I think the GOP underestimate the power of new technology. You can't keep the truth from the soldiers anymore. Lot harder to brainwash them.

And with what Bush did??? Blackwater was the biggest slap in the face to the soldiers. They were above the law, got paid more, caused problems, made the troops look bad.

And you still want to assume the troops are voting GOP? Then you think they are stupid?

still haven't seen any proof from you bobo.
 
 
Here is the difference when you refer to troops you say They. When I refer to troops I say We. Get it? Blackwater wasn't a slap in the face having rules of engagement governed by people who are not even in the war was a slap in the face. Having liberals rant that we weren't liberating and seeing young girls raped with knives because they were the wrong religion is a slap in the face so please before you speak on my behalf or any other soldiers behalf walk in our shoes. Thank You

What proof did you ever have that the GOP won in 2004, 2000, 96, 92, etc?

I have 6 to 1 in favor of Obama.

What chu got Del?

I find phony soldiers like you on these boards all the time. When I talk to soldiers who don't have a political agenda, I get the truth.

How long has it been since you were in the service?

PS. Military gave to Obama 6 to 1. So you dumb fuck one in the 6 to 1.  

And excuse me if you are feeling guilty about crimes that may have been committed.

And excuse us for reporting the facts.

 KBR Must Be Accountable for Iraq Deaths: US Senators | CommonDreams.org 

The day we stop reporting the facts because of "PATRIOTISM" is the day, well, actually, that would be 2000-2006.

 Michelle Malkin » A closer look at those Halliburton/KBR gang-rape allegations 

And I typically don't bitch about the soldiers. Usually I'm arguing for them. Like how the military is telling the VA doctors not to diagnose vets with PTSD because it will cost the military more.

And all that shit went on under Bush, and now Obama is going to bend over backward for Vets, and assholes like you won't appreciate it because you are brainwashed. Just like McCain when he was in the Hanoi Hilton. Fucking Manchurian Candidate.

I respect you and McCain for your service, but that doesn't mean you aren't evil arrogant greedy cock suckers the both of you. How many houses do you have idiot?

Because I thought that he was better for the job but didn't want to spend my money on someone who was only going to be a little bit better than the competition? I'd rather save my money and ride the rails and keep my money in my pocket.

 
And excuse me if you are feeling guilty about crimes that may have been committed.

 

What crimes and what guilt dont twist my words. Young girls were raped and killed in Iraq because of religion and you say we aren't liberators. The politicians have their reasons for war be we have our reasons for fighting. DO NOT get the two confused.

 
The day we stop reporting the facts because of "PATRIOTISM" is the day, well, actually, that would be 2000-2006.

 

You report the facts as told to you not from experience see where yours seem to be less reliable. Hell you report hearsay which doesn't even hold up in court. Join the military then tell me your opinion based on experience.

 
And I typically don't bitch about the soldiers. Usually I'm arguing for them. Like how the military is telling the VA doctors not to diagnose vets with PTSD because it will cost the military more.

Obama is not going to bend over backwards to help us. He is going to try and bend us over but seeing as how you see things backwards I can see how you formed that opinion.

 
I respect you and McCain for your service, but that doesn't mean you aren't evil arrogant greedy cock suckers the both of you. How many houses do you have idiot?  

 

I have one house. If you knew any people in the military like you claim you would know thats what we can afford. In all actuality you probably make more than me bobo.

Counter Questions:

1. Why do you think we gave so much to Obama? 6 out of every 1 soldiers must have been worried about McCain being Commander, and that must have something to do with Bush's leadership, huh?

2. Weren't you scared Obama was going to win? Wasn't that enough to give $ to McCain?

3. I wish I could wave a magic wand and exclude you from all the liberal benefits that will be coming your way via Obama.

Just like you right wing idiots. You are anti labor/unions when they gave you everything you have today. Days off, sick days, vacation days, maternaty leave, workers rights, workers safety, healthcare, raises.

Just like you will still vote for McCain even though he has fucked you in the ass 80% of the time.

So you got fucked by the GOP in the service and you will get fucked by them when you come back to civilian life.

How many vets have to live under a bridge before you realize bush fucked you guys over?

How many PTSD cases need to be denied and end up hurting themselves or others.

Obama is not going to bend over backwards to help us. He is going to try and bend us over but seeing as how you see things backwards I can see how you formed that opinion.

I have one house. If you knew any people in the military like you claim you would know thats what we can afford. In all actuality you probably make more than me bobo.

 

Counter Questions:

1. Why do you think we gave so much to Obama? 6 out of every 1 soldiers must have been worried about McCain being Commander, and that must have something to do with Bush's leadership, huh?

2. Weren't you scared Obama was going to win? Wasn't that enough to give $ to McCain?

3. I wish I could wave a magic wand and exclude you from all the liberal benefits that will be coming your way via Obama.

Just like you right wing idiots. You are anti labor/unions when they gave you everything you have today. Days off, sick days, vacation days, maternaty leave, workers rights, workers safety, healthcare, raises.

Just like you will still vote for McCain even though he has fucked you in the ass 80% of the time.

So you got fucked by the GOP in the service and you will get fucked by them when you come back to civilian life.

How many vets have to live under a bridge before you realize bush fucked you guys over?

How many PTSD cases need to be denied and end up hurting themselves or others.

Man, you right wingers are stubborn. No matter how hard they put it in your ass, you insist it feels good.

 

you're an idiot, and you still haven't shown any proof that "six out of every one soldiers" voted for obama.

adjust your meds.

again.

 

All I care is that 51% of them or more voted for Obama.

And I'm willing to bet 51% did vote for Obama. Are you willing to bet $ that McCain won the military vote?

Even when the military gave 6 to 1 to Obama?

I don't think you would make that bet Del.

But I am willing to make that bet.

Six to one is the dollar figure provided to the campaign not the votes themselves. I can see how you misinterpreted the Facts bobo.

2. Weren't you scared Obama was going to win? Wasn't that enough to give $ to McCain?
I was scared that there wasn't a viable candidate running.

You support the troops but only the ones that agree with you? Fair enough.

Just like you right wing idiots. You are anti labor/unions when they gave you everything you have today. Days off, sick days, vacation days, maternaty leave, workers rights, workers safety, healthcare, raises.
What Union gives soldiers benefits? I don't have sick days. As far as workers rights if its constitutional I have the right to do it.

Just like you will still vote for McCain even though he has fucked you in the ass 80% of the time.
Not still vote for. Voted for instead of is the phrase that pays.

So you got fucked by the GOP in the service and you will get fucked by them when you come back to civilian life.
No the government will only screw the people who are ignorant to the regulations.

How many vets have to live under a bridge before you realize bush fucked you guys over?
McDonalds is still hiring so tell them to crawl out from under the bridge.

How many PTSD cases need to be denied and end up hurting themselves or others.
Well Doctor bobo how many have you denied? Do you have a number? Do you know we are briefed on ptsd and have counselors and doctors sent to each unit multiple times during the year and that amount increases before during and after deployments?

Man, you right wingers are stubborn. No matter how hard they put it in your ass, you insist it feels good.
We know we are getting screwed the thing is its both parties screwing us. The sad thing is you only notice one party doing the screwing.
 
 
 
Aww the little leftistas are having a circle jerk because the "Onion" and CNN say so.

Funny, but when I ask the troops I know, I hear the real story, they didn't vote for him/it and are getting out as soon as their time is over.

 

Thats cause you hang around with other fascists like you

1. So what percent do you think Obama got from the military this year? If he got 6 to 1 in $, what percent do you think he got in votes? Do you think he lost the military vote? Of course you do. But then again, you guys have been saying for years that the GOP owns the military vote, and you haven't provided DICK for proof.

2. You guys are always so sure that the GOP gets the military vote, yet you can't even show me who won the military vote from last year? Are you sure? Doesn't look good to me for the GOP.

3. Supporting the troops but only the ones that agree with me? That's Rush Limbaugh and the GOP's thing, not mine. That Phony soldier comment came straight from Rush. LOL. Thats the thing about Democrats. We help you out even if you didn't support us in the election. The GOP does the opposite. They fuck over the people that voted for them. Everyone but the top 1%.

4. McDonalds is still hiring? That tells me you don't care why so many more veterans are ending up suicidile, homicidle and depressed.

I guess you can be a hartless prick to the troops since you served, and I can't have an opinion because I didn't.

Well let me tell you sir, you were brainwashed, are still brainwashed, and you need to start listening to people who have different opinions.

And just like McCain being a soldiier/pow in no way makes him qualified to be commander and chief, you prove that being over there doesn't mean necessarily that you know what is going on.

No doubt they were all right wingers to begin with.

But then again, you guys have been saying for years that the GOP owns the military vote, and you haven't provided DICK for proof.
You are the one talking about the percentage of military votes that went this way or that, not me. So why is it that I am providing proof for words you are putting in my mouth? The reason why you do not have the specifics is because military personnel can not say who they voted for.

2. You guys are always so sure that the GOP gets the military vote, yet you can't even show me who won the military vote from last year? Are you sure? Doesn't look good to me for the GOP.
Who is you guys? I happen to have registered republican and voted whoever I thought was best for the job so please try not to catagorize me just to hekp build your arguement.

3. Supporting the troops but only the ones that agree with me? That's Rush Limbaugh and the GOP's thing, not mine. That Phony soldier comment came straight from Rush. LOL. Thats the thing about Democrats. We help you out even if you didn't support us in the election. The GOP does the opposite. They fuck over the people that voted for them. Everyone but the top 1%.
Whoever the phony soldier comment came from when you heard it doesn't take away that it came out of your mouth directed at me. I don't care about party affiliation and couldn't care less about Limbaugh's opinion.

4. McDonalds is still hiring? That tells me you don't care why so many more veterans are ending up suicidile, homicidle and depressed.
Not that I don't care but that there are other avenues to go about instead of being under a bridge as you put it. If in fact they are in need they can go to any VA and seek help.

I guess you can be a hartless prick to the troops since you served, and I can't have an opinion because I didn't.
Once again you are putting words in my mouth. Im not heartless Im a realist. You can have your opinion just try not to get it confused with fact.

Well let me tell you sir, you were brainwashed, are still brainwashed, and you need to start listening to people who have different opinions.
The same has been said about you bobo.

And just like McCain being a soldiier/pow in no way makes him qualified to be commander and chief, you prove that being over there doesn't mean necessarily that you know what is going on.
Yet you claim an absolute knowledge with no experience? This proves you can think you are smart while everyone else is slightly entertained by your ignorance.
 
 
 
It's clear from the wildly enthusiastic response from the troops this morning that President Obama is a source of inspiration and hope for members of the US military. The beloved President's remarks were repeatedly interrupted by wild cheering from the troops. Who can blame them? He's ending a bloody, needless Republican war and is saving tens of thousands of lives and billions and billions of dollars in the process. God bless him.

 

Obama has yet to do anything but speak well. Let's see what the military thinks of him in fours years. Obama faces a powder keg the size of which I doubt he is prepared in Afghanistan and Pakistan, with Pakistan being the possible issue to define Obama as a leader. So sing his praises, but, don't be so blind.

And just some food for thought, I know some ranking military with long term service in, who he scares the hell out of.

I was asked two questions. I answered them. Perhaps you should take up your annoyance with the diversion with the person that asked.

Back on topic. Fort Lawton is close to the restaurant I am sitting in at the moment. Soldiers come here frequently and most of them support Obama. Don't let that dent your opinion..I'm sure that in YOUR house all the soldiers hate the president.
 
 
 
 
 
I find phony soldiers like you on these boards all the time. When I talk to soldiers who don't have a political agenda, I get the truth.

 

Haha leave it to someone who hasn't served to call a soldier phony. Pathetic.

I'm still in.

Because I thought that he was better for the job but didn't want to spend my money on someone who was only going to be a little bit better than the competition? I'd rather save my money and ride the rails and keep my money in my pocket.

What crimes and what guilt dont twist my words. Young girls were raped and killed in Iraq because of religion and you say we aren't liberators. The politicians have their reasons for war be we have our reasons for fighting. DO NOT get the two confused.

You report the facts as told to you not from experience see where yours seem to be less reliable. Hell you report hearsay which doesn't even hold up in court. Join the military then tell me your opinion based on experience.

I respect you and McCain for your service, but that doesn't mean you aren't evil arrogant greedy cock suckers the both of you. How many houses do you have idiot?

"Phony soldiers", huh? Who the fuck are YOU? A phony PERIOD.

You could start by explaining how 6 of every 1 soldiers do ANYTHING, artard.

Nobody with a brain thought Obama would be a better CinC than McCain. That's one thing I even gave McCain credit for.

If you could wave that wand, make sure you wave it over the hand that takes back twice what the other gives, you simpleton.

Labor unions don't give anyone any of the above. Labor LAWS do.

How many unemployed because of the economy have to live under a bridge before YOU figure out you've been played, fool?

One thing we DO know, no Republicans can get anything in YOUR ass with that big fucking rock in top of your shoulders shoved so far up it.
 
 
Could someone please explain to me how "6 out of every 1" works? Do you divide 1 by 6? Do you saw a person into six pieces?

I understand how you can have "1 out of every 6," but the "6 out of every 1" doesn't jibe. What idiot is responsible for that mathematical gaffe?

You right wing fucking hypocrite pussies. Seriously?

Afganistan is the war we should be fighting.

I wonder if we would have won already had Bush not spread us too thin by starting the Iraq war before the Afgan war was finished?

Do you still want to capture or kill Bin Ladin? Or like Bush, do you not think about him that seriously.

But I swear to god, you god damn cock sucking Republicans are going to now start playing politics with Afganistan? Stop it! For the sake of the troops. LOL.

But seriously, your fuckng party was in charge on 9-11 and you got attacked, and then 8 years later you didn't capture Bin Ladin? You should be a fucking shamed of yourselves.

And you should never have the fucking balls to bring up Afganistan. If you bring up Afganistan, you automatically lose the arguement, because if anything, Afgan is the shining example of what a failure you and your party are.

Seriously, you Republicans are treasonist. I'd fight against you all in a new Civil War. I don't want anything to do with you fucking losers anymore.

We'll take Pittsburg, Philly, NY, Chicago, California, Detroit, Boston, etc. We'll take every city/state that makes America great, and you can keep the fucking hillbilly states.

Then you can elect what ever dumb fuck you want and you can get hit on 9-11 every year. Fucking weak ass GOP.

No wonder their voters are dumb as fuck.

 

I think you've convinced me. Every time I think there might be hope for some reasonability among Dems, someone like you shoots off and convinces me it just ain't so.

This "stimulus" plan will be cutting their their hopes for a long future as well. The plan is to tell the senior citizens that they just need to live weith theior health conditions and ot waste money on insurance because it will not cover many of those conditions any longer.

American military personell are in real trouble, Obama is not on their side. He really doesn't care for them.

I am rightwing when you compare me to the leftwing. I would never serve under Obama. He is not even an American. He is dissing America everytime he turns around. He says this is not a Chtristian nation, cool. He apologized to the world for the arrogance of the American people, and he has thanked the Muslims for their great contributions to this country. He is totally unamerican. I do not claim him as my president, however I really don't need him anyway, I have God. He even proved that he is ashamed of God when he spoke at Georgetown.

This is not the same America My Dad fought for in WW II. I have nothing good to say about this prez. Call me what you want, I am correct, and everyone on his side will see it when it is too late.
 
 
 
Could someone please explain to me how "6 out of every 1" works? Do you divide 1 by 6? Do you saw a person into six pieces?

I understand how you can have "1 out of every 6," but the "6 out of every 1" doesn't jibe. What idiot is responsible for that mathematical gaffe?

 

Explanation:

Take one hit of acid.

Drink half a bottle of Jack.

Take at least 3-4 hits off a power hitter.

Voila! Screwball math.  
 
 
 
 
Obama has yet to do anything but speak well.

 

You must have been sleeping when this happened:

 
US navy snipers have shot dead three pirates holding a US captain in a boat off Somalia, in a dramatic rescue authorised by President Barack Obama.

 

 BBC NEWS | Africa | US captain rescued from pirates 

 

What the hell does Obama have to do with the skills of well trained SEALS and military personal?

Nothing!

It is the presidents 'duty' to give the orders to protect American's no matter where they are in the world. So Obama did this! Big deal. Frankly my 12 year old son could have come to the same conclusion!

It's pretty sad when the very 'basics' of the job become something spectacular!
 
 
 
 
 
You right wing fucking hypocrite pussies. Seriously?

Afganistan is the war we should be fighting.

I wonder if we would have won already had Bush not spread us too thin by starting the Iraq war before the Afgan war was finished?

Do you still want to capture or kill Bin Ladin? Or like Bush, do you not think about him that seriously.

But I swear to god, you god damn cock sucking Republicans are going to now start playing politics with Afganistan? Stop it! For the sake of the troops. LOL.

But seriously, your fuckng party was in charge on 9-11 and you got attacked, and then 8 years later you didn't capture Bin Ladin? You should be a fucking shamed of yourselves.

And you should never have the fucking balls to bring up Afganistan. If you bring up Afganistan, you automatically lose the arguement, because if anything, Afgan is the shining example of what a failure you and your party are.

Seriously, you Republicans are treasonist. I'd fight against you all in a new Civil War. I don't want anything to do with you fucking losers anymore.

We'll take Pittsburg, Philly, NY, Chicago, California, Detroit, Boston, etc. We'll take every city/state that makes America great, and you can keep the fucking hillbilly states.

Then you can elect what ever dumb fuck you want and you can get hit on 9-11 every year. Fucking weak ass GOP.

No wonder their voters are dumb as fuck.

I purchased myself a new Redneck Ball Cap and a new Vehicle to graphic up, just in honor of these idiots.

When the Proud to be American Truck is finished, I will post it. At least the acorn idiots won't walk up soliciting! lol

It's not the same my father fought for either in WWII and it pains him daily to watch some of this taking place. National pride is now something to be institutionalized over or jailed. Sad, very, very sad.

You're going to take Pittsburgh? You can't even spell it you dumb fuck....... you are a douche bag...... it's just that simple....... wait, you're just that simple.  

 

Wow, that's your reply? That tells me I'm right. If that's all you can say to my post, I must be right. You guys are PUSSIES!!! Everything is political with you cock suckers. Luckily, you fucking take the wrong side of every issue. Its fucking easy to be a liberal now a days.

PS. Did McCain win the military vote? NOT!!!

Why don't you take a long hard look at your own party. There is no working with idiots on your side of the isle. So, fuck you. We're in charge. Now you want bipartisanship? Fuck off!!! Sit and watch for a change. You can't do any more harm other than obstructing liberal progress. And we were never going to win you over, so kiss my fucking liberal ass bitch. Stupid fucking conservatives.

Liberalism at it's finest, in action. Change we can count on!  
 
 
as active air force im pretty sure they tell us to "support" the government and keep our opinions to ourselves. mine however is i think obama is a loser and a terrible leader.   so there. (also, first post since joining this site! Woot!)
 
 
My son just got back from the Middle East last Wednesday. He says that in his unit there isn't a big amount of love for our "beloved" (sic) President... Not real sure you have your facts correct.
 
 
My son is in Iraq right now for the THIRD time. He's a Sgt in the ARmy, he's only 26 yrs old, married and has 2 little kids. But he BELIEVES IN WHAT HE'S THERE FOR! And, he said the majority of his troops over there did NOT want Obama as president. So i dont' know where some of you are getting your information. They know "No-bama" (as they call him) do not care at all about them. How good is that for their moral? To know your own president is worthless, a liar, and in all of this for himself.
Like i said, my son believes in what we're doing over there. He's seen so much that many of you will never know about. He said we're doing good over there, helping them to become a country that hopefully someday they can be proud of. More than we can say about our own country at this moment!

What is it that we are doing there?...There are several "theres" there.

Sounds like your son is a tad more patriotic than you. Does his wife believe that potentially destroying her own family is worth our involvement in Iraq? Not to get into your family except you brought it into the discussion.

Is there any line you could draw including your sons service that would make you believe that invading Iraq was wrong?

I just get the idea and perhaps I am mistaken..that in your mind there is no reason good enough for an american to dispute our venture in Iraq...not because of patriotism..but because your son has been deployed there. Am I wrong?

Yes, you are wrong.
I hate the thought of him being over there...i'd be much happier if it wasn't going on. But i also know that we did have a good reason to do this.
People keep saying there never was WMD. But there was...there's films of truck after truck leaving Iraq before the war started, carrying "something" into Syria. Bush didn't just rush in and attack Iraq, he kept giving Saddam a chance to comply. This also gave them a chance to move any WMD that they had. There's proof of it all over that country. Saddams regime tortured, raped and murdered their own people. The average people in Iraq, the ones that are the targets of the insurgents and being murdered by them, love the Americans being there. My son has told stories of how they want to join the American Army. When he would be on guard duty the women would bring them food and thank them. If all people listen to is CNN or MSNBC news, they won't hear this stuff! If we in the US lived through something like that, we would want someone come to help us also.

After my son spent a year in 2006 in the center of Baghdad, I sat and held my 25 yr old son at that time while he cried for the people over there! Nothing anyone says will convince me that we did the wrong thing.
