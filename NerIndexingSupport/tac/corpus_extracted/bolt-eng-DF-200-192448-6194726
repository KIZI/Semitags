Down with Tory scum! Vote labour  
 
 
I thought David Cameron came out top, by quite a way. He demonstrated that he had the gall to lead our country, whereas Clegg proved that he is a brilliant orator, but somewhat lacking the balls to do anything.

Brown made up the numbers quite well.

Down with Labour! Vote Tory  
 
 
Brown came out the worst, as shown by the opinion polls. I cannot see how any Labour supporter thinks he has done well, he was awful.
 
 
I didn't think anyone came out of it well. We're missing any truly great statesmen.
 
 
Lol.

David Cameron was rather evasive, particularly when Gordon Brown was questioning him.

However, having just seen the opinion polls, it still seems that people perceive that Cameron outperformed Brown. I find that strange. He really didn't 'sell' his policies to me. People praised his stance on immigration, but Clegg and Brown both contested this idea of an arbitrary cap.
 
 
Down with the tories vote Lib Dem  
 
 
Pretty much all the opinion polls agree that it was in fact Brown who got 'owned'... but I would agree that Clegg appeared to come out on top

How so?

I admit that he has limited oratory skills, but shouldn't we be focusing on the substance of what he's saying.
Politics shouldn't be a performance.

I like Gordon Brown, people need to give the poor man a break.

David Cameron was just spewing nasty snatch gunk. And every time Nick Clegg spoke Shaggy kept playing in my head....  

Clearly I am not very politically astute.
 
 
I dont think Cameron got "owned" at all. Nor do I think he was weak.

You've got to be kidding.

Nick Clegg clearly came out on top. All Cameron did was quote anecdotes and appeal to the masses with stuff that doesn't answer the questions.

Funniest bit was when Cameron pretty much said "Even a black guy told me he didn't want any more immigration"
 
 
I think Clegg did the best, although that point on Trident was a bit of a miss for me, but the schools part was spot on. Second I think was Cameron, though his point of 1 out of a 100 pounds was just lame and lacked any real analysis, but a good ending and probably the best one on the NHS. Brown - I didn't really like much and the point on needing government "waste" to stimulate the economy, meh under-analyzed.

If we focused on the substance of the last 13 years he would not get a single vote. How can we trust him now?
 
 
It's hilariously ludicrous how anyone can think Cameron came out worst. Even second is questionable.

In my view Cameron came out top because he was very resilient, answered the questions with clarity, and showed he is a real leader. Brown without question came out worst, he was pathetic. Clegg was good, and did much better I think than anyone expected, but nonetheless didn't offer much apart from being a good orator.
 
 
Brown was the elephant in the room in more ways than one.
 
 
It's about time blue_shift stopped politik trolling I say!

Great. Well perhaps you should preach to the nation then, as the early opinion polls showed Brown bottom. Seems that my opinion is quite a popular opinion eh?

That's not what I'm suggesting.

People thought that Cameron was persuasive on the issue of immigration - yet the other two immediately articulated the limitations of Cameron's point, and in what I consider to be an effective manner. Therefore, I'm surprised that these convincing contestations didn't have a greater impact on people who were polled.

Sense!
 
 
it depends on how much of a open mind people went into this with,
now by the end cameron face you call tell it was a beaten man, it didn't look the normal PMQ man barking out or on the campaign

tv debates in the USA they look at every thing, the amount of make up, body movements and everything, these are the areas that we cameron lacked tonight, nothing like his normal act

brown can out a lot better than people thought he would, but if can into if a mind already make up that his failed you won't listen to him, and you won't take any notice of what he has to say

unlike clegg who well has nothing to lose, he can sell you the world, and pick up the swing voters

It seemed from what they were saying that the Conservatives had the only real plan. The other two were saying how we need immigration but it needs to be reduced blah blah blah. Cameron was the only one to say "I am going to take definite action and put a cap on immigration". I think that's what is appealing about his immigration policy. IMO anyway!

I decided to check for trolling by looking through some of your posts via your profile.

I'll put it this way: if you're not a troll, you are an incredibly vicious, spiteful individual.
 
 
Brown was pathetic in my opinion. He was the most evasive, and took every opportunity possible to take a stab at the conservative party. It wasn't a debate for him, just a tv opportunity to put down the tories. he was just scare mongering, and he just made himself look like a fool.
Clegg did very well, but then again he was always going to. The Lib Dems haven't been in power in decades, they've got nothing to lose. The trinity proposal however is incredibly wrong for our current economy.
Cameron was excellent imo. He held back from attacking openly like Brown, put across the most appealing points and argued the opposing points put against him well.

Clegg came out on top by far. But that could just be that because Cameron and Brown daren't argue against him in the case of a hung parliament.

And OP, how did I know this would be you? Hah.

And according to ITV's opinion poll, it was Clegg 43% >> Cameron 26% > Brown 20%.

Brown came off as a bully and a suck up. All he did was agree with Clegg and attack everything Cameron said.

What a mature approach, got nothing positive to say about Labour so just sling mud at the Conservatives.

Labour;
Lied about a war
Sent the Army ill-equipped to fight these wars
Introduced 3000 news laws by 2006
Believe in enforcing their will upon the population irrespective of their views - Elitism at its most blatent.
Lied about top-up fees.
Ruined the police force with bureaucracy.
Destroyed discipline in schools.

But hey ho - lets play the inverse snobbery card (bit of a discriminating method isn't it?) and hide the fact we are hardly the working class heroes we pretend we are.

Ex-Labour voters provide most of the support for the BNP don't you know?

Down with Labour scum! Vote for anyone - nay, ANYTHING other than Labour!

the final poll came out as that   the running poll that was doing pretty much had clegg on top, but brown beating cameron, as well as the live comments from people saying cameron wasn't doing that great

I'll agree that Cameron didn't do very well tonight. But he picked it up towards the end of the debate, his final speech was really good I thought. Brown was dull and came across as nothing more than a bully and a suck-up, as I posted before.
 
 
When does David Cameron ever do well???????????????????????????? ?
 
 
Brown came out the worst. You could see him sniggering/smiling whilst the others were talking, and then he made a silly comment about air-brushing. Pretty cheap and irrelevant.

Clegg was good early on, but then adopted a 'mighter than you' stance and kept refering to the Conservatives and Labour as very similar and generally putting them down when he'd have done better to talk about his policies more imo.

If trouble is to arise, we'd be left defenceless, in the hands of the United States, France and Germany begging for help. Is this the type of cut that the government should be making?

 

Although undecided as per usual, I am leaning towards disagreeing with nuclear disarmament really, and felt that Nick Clegg's points about it being no more than "a Cold War weapon" were rather weak and dont get quite why the other two didn't leap on that immediately. Cameron's defence of Trident was accurate but too late.

Just to point out, you'd struggle to find a voter who agreed with every single last one of his party's numerous policies.

Oh come off it, it wasn't about 'coming out on top' - and frankly I think people are overanalysing it and debasing it to petty personality politics if they try to discuss it in these terms. I was surprised that all of them came across as fairly human, but aside from that I really don't care.

This sort of response is exactly why I opposed these debates in the first place.

Haha yes I am  

On having a party leader debate, there has been quite a bit of questioning regarding this in the buildup because its a very good point. I guess the argument for it is that they are the leaders of their party, therefore they represent their views

Absolutely. Not to mention, it was a valid criticism.

I'm personally put off by Cameron because he does seem airbrushed, and not very down to earth. By extension, I worry that he's not very frank about his policies too.

Clegg was always going to come out of this debate having gained the most, simply because he's a Liberal Democrat, and as a Lib Dem getting recognised as a politician with equal credibility to the Tories and Labour is half the battle. He managed that just by standing on the stage next to the other politicians.

Who came out the worst? Brown, quite clearly. And all the opinion polls show it.

i'll put my hands up to the fact that cameron had a good closing statement, which brown lacked

brown has got alot of substance but just can't get it across as great as the others, the BBC was doing a show on that how to prepare for the debates, talking to ex presidents (that was pretty good to watch) one of the areas they covered was the look and how important it is, looking back at nixon and JFK, people who watched it on tv felt that JFK won because he looked better, but those listen to it on the radio felt it was more nixon, they agree brown is good at bring facts in, and the substance level, but just can't get it across well, the others can

i felt brown was better than what he could be like, not the PR mess

clegg is going to have a hard time in the next debate and the pressure will be off cameron, and brown will be brown should be good watching

isn't the poll a mere 1019 people or something? There's the problem. I think nationally the view may be very different. I for one loved GB's performance and agree with your view that DC was being evasive and dodging browns questions re: 6000 million pound tax cut thingy.

I agree very much here, I'm sure even Brown and Darling; Cameron and Osborne; Clegg and Cable, all have their disagreements, and they're on the same sides!   I do however this that this is a critical issue of national security, and it alone stops me considering a Lib Dem vote. Other than that I agree with the Lib Dems on many issues, their transport policy especially, but I cannot tick the box of any party who will save money by risky national security, and removing a deterrent to attack upon us.
 
 
Cameron was much weaker than I expected him to be. He came across as particularly nervous at the start of the debate, but he managed to pick himself up a bit.

I laughed when he said 'do do'

Cleggy's policies were very understandable and straight forward, and that really helped him gain the excellent performance he did. Although I felt Brown outlined his points as well, he just did everything else poorly.

Cameron had some policies but it was all kind of wishy-washy. He mentioned cutting "waste" all the time, but he only specified paperwork in police forces as far as I can remember, and other sources of waste he could have mentioned were replaced by rather bizarre anecdotes. Brown's point about us investing this year when the economy's teetering on the brink actually made sense.

I'll be voting for neither of these parties so I like to think I can speak from a relatively unbiased viewpoint. I should point out that prior to the debate I ranked Clegg>Brown>>>Cameron (really don't like him), however my opinion after this show is (very interestingly) Brown>Cameron>>>>Clegg. I thought Clegg was an absolute flop tonight, he seemed to just play on "look at me I'm an outsider *pointing at Cameron and Brown*" card continuously without really delivering any substance. I also found his constant staring into the camera extremely annoying. I thought Cameron was dire at the start, he looked like a nervous wreck and he was just letting Brown lay into him, however I do think that he improved dramatically towards the end of the show and was probably the strongest performer in the last 30 minutes of the show.I just felt on the whole that Brown came across best over the course of the show, he was humorous, he was smiling throughout the show, his body language seemed relaxed and he appeared to project to the audience very well.

yes! GB provided more substance as did Nick Clegg, but more so Gordon Brown particularly with his use of numbers and figures to back his points which he put across.

Every time Cameron started to say something, Brown rolled his eyes and when he could interrupted and cut him off. He never let Cameron finish a point.

And substance? If it wasn't interrupting Cameron, it was "I agree with Nick". Sucking up to Nick Clegg for a hung parliament.
 
 
The polls seem to be showing camaron on top gdgd cant wait for the election. Although i do not like Brown i thought he did quite well and Clegg just annoys me

It's annoying when a party has largely an excellent set of policies, and then a select few that ruin it for you. I actually had a look through the Green manifesto out of interest, really loved most of their policies (i.e. employment stimuli packages; investment in renewable energy), but stopped reading after I got to the bit where they wouldn't build anymore nuclear reactors. I know the Green party doesn't matter in the grand scheme of the election, but I still feel let down.

He is obviously a hard line tory supporter and has no freedom of thought process. I am pro labour but think nick clegg came out on top, wednesday is tory and he things cameron didn't do that well....Tory hardliners will be tory hardliners....most people agree it was nick clegg, brown then DC in that order. I am pro labour and think brown lacked the flair that nick clegg had but he was solid on hammering home the points i feel.

Donno how many of the electorate didn't know that but it hammered in the enormity of what DC was proposing, then DC came back with his lame "oh but it's only £1 in every £100". That just made him come across as "money is no object for me" kinda guy....meh....Everything about DC just makes me want to hate him!

Perhaps people though it might have been £600 million as it is in the states.
 
 
The majority of polls would state that Clegg came first, Cameron second and Brown last.

What we must remember is that Clegg had no expectation so he had everything to go for.
Brown was expected to do badly and in my view he did.
Cameron didn't do as brilliant as he could have done.
 
 
Nick Clegg EASILY won that, but it's a shame they'll never win

37|35|20 on immigration, with Gordon last (and Cameron first)

YouGov-
51|29|19, with Gordon last

Populus-
61|22|17, with Gordon last

When every credible polling authority is giving Gordon a thorough slamming, touting a very marginal 1 point second-place position on a rather shaky Sky News poll looks a bit like desperation.

Mr Clegg was also the clear winner of the debate in a YouGov opinion poll for The Sun.

Some 51% of the 1,091 people questioned said Mr Clegg had come out on top, 22 points ahead of David Cameron on 29%, with Mr Brown trailing on 19%.

And in another poll of 4,032 voters, carried out by ComRes for ITV News, Mr Clegg
was again rated the victor, with 43%, against 26% for Mr Cameron and 20% for Mr Brown.

Sky News  http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Pol...Faster_Results 

 
Clegg 37%
Brown 32%
Cameron 31%
 

Which is pretty much what I thought.

Clegg>Brown>Cameron.

and look at the live moving graph on itv when he talked about imigration it went negative for the first time but went up very high when cameron said his bit.

Down with Labour! Vote Tory  

 

He had his moments but did not do as well as he should have.

He proposed the idea of these debates and in the end was left wanting.

What these debates will hopefully do is make people look at the pary manifestos in much more detail.

Take a look at the vast, vast majority of poll analysis out there and you'll see that you couldn't be more wrong. Clegg came off best and Cameron could've done better, but Brown utterly bombed.

A lot of misinformed people bring this up. You don't vote for the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is voted in by MPs. Gordon Brown isn't some sort of illegal imposter.
 
 
tbh, all polls are a load of bullshizx

I mean, people just end up following the results of them like sheeps instead of actually using their own intelligence to form opinions and ideas.
 
 
seems the sky news poll puts clegg on 37%, brown on 32% and cameron on 31%
Mr Clegg scored highly on health (+6), taxation (+4), nuclear weapons (+6) and benefits (+6), but lagged behind on law and order (-3.8) and government (-4).

Voters were not been impressed by Mr Brown's policies on armed forces (-3), taxation (-7), health (-2.5) and law and order (-2.7), but reacted positively to his plans for education (+2.6) and the recession (+1.4).
David Cameron scored highly on families (+3.3) and taxation (+4), but fell short on his policies on Iraq (-4.8), the America (-6) and Europe (-6)

differnent polls show different things, more will come in the coming days
 
 
Its easy for Clegg to do well..

He will never be in power so he can speak as much **** as he wants.
 
 
Good! Hopefully this reduces the chances of him becoming the next PM further. The Conservatives' sums just do not add up. They can't afford to protect public services, lower taxes and scrap NI increase. The thing that worries me most is that they aren't clear on what will have to go. Unfortunately many of the electorate (practically all of Southern England) will vote for David Cameron... then we'll all be hammered with his savage cuts.

Clegg was really impressive, he came across really calm and prepared!! Although to be fair I think Brown and Cameron were more under attack than him - well done Clegg though, as someone above said, I think he did much better than anyone expected  
 
 
I think the only reason that the opinion polls say that nick clegg came out on top is because he had the easier position compared to cameron and brown, being the under dog, and its easier to criticise the 65 years that the tories and labour have dominated the political scene and offer an "alternative" which involves the abolition of trident, in a period when overseas threats seem to be at a high- madness in my view. I personally think he had more air time compared to cameron and brown which probably gave the impression to the audience that he was ahead in the debate. I hope the conservatives win the election as the trend seems to be that labour ruin the golden years of economic growth and then the conservatives are re-elected to pick up the pieces..just my thoughts anyway.
 
 
Did no one else find Cameron's reference to China a little bit worrying? The touted future PM citing the most populous country in the world as a possible threat. I'm sure that'll go down well in Beijing.

And I thought Boris Johnson was a ****. Why would he make such statements in public? What an eejit.
 
 
I loved it when they all whipped out their pre-meditated, polished and perfectly fitting anecdotes in a row  

The debate played into Cleggs hands, due to a combination of the extremity Brown's arse-licking and his general inability to orate naturally, and the fact neither Cameron nor Brown could truly pin anything of substance on the Lib Dem's.

Of course it's a possible threat. That's not a political position - a cursory glance at basic international relations theory places China as an almost certain destabilising influence in future.

Perhaps it might've been a minor gaff to admit it in public, but it's hardly a secret or even much disputed that China could be a threat in future.
 
 
Cameron was awful, "i met a black man" then using China and Iran in the same sentence, hilarious. Don't know what all the drama is about Brown being unelected, he's head of government, not state, you vote for the party generally. Cameron was very evasive on anything and went back to the traditional CUT WASTE JOB TAX LOL. Clegg and Brown gave him a good *******. Best part on the mail website how Brown made a gaffe going off the platform to shake hands, when in reality Cameron looked like a mong standing up there in the spotlight instead of going down to the great unwashed masses.
 
 
Debate was pretty cringeworthy all round IMO. Brown came across as completely the opposite of Prime Ministerial, Cameron was his usual smarmy aggravating self, and I wanted to slap Nick Clegg every time he opened his mouth to spout his fake indignation. Thoroughly uninspiring.
 
 
Quick side note...did anyone see the SNP party political broadcast ? The bit at the end when someone shouts "SCOTLAND" is the most cheesiest thing i've heard in my life!

Where did I dispute that it's a threat? Most members of the public will know that, but we're not in positions of political power. What we say doesn't carry any weight whatsoever. Sure, be on alert, but don't broadcast it on live television.
 
 
I thought Cameron did pretty well, he held his ground. He was the only one to actually stop talking when the presenter moved on to the next person, unlike Brown who wouldn't bloody shut up. I found Clegg just annoying, always going on about "we need truth in politics, and that only means us" blah blah blah. He was like a bloody record stuck on repeat.
 
 
Nick Clegg was better.. but then again Lib Dems haven't been in power, so it's not like Cameron or Brown could attack the way Lib Dems run, whereas Clegg could..
 
 
You can't airbrush your policies like you airbrush your posters, David.

I love Gordie for saying that.
 
 
For me, Clegg sneaked it by a nose in front of Cameron. That can be put down to the fact that Clegg had the 'easy' task of not doing anything disasterous and instead sitting back and picking spots to snipe at. Both Clegg and Cameron performed pretty well whilst another leader was speaking, which is more than can be said for big Broonzer. I particularly enjoyed Brown's just desserts when it came to the topic of cancer care (he sat shaking his head and frowning at what Cameron was saying, which is maybe bad enough, but then Cameron mentioned cancer deaths in his constituency and Brown was then in a bad place). Cameron got the last strong speech section of the night in when he spoke of carers and their needs, I felt that he did well there.

What I'd say is that Clegg was marginally the best of the night on a flat measure, but Cameron was far and away the best of the night when you adjust performance against what each politician had to lose. Clegg will delighted of course - the equal airtime that everyone's been speaking about and the face that he did nothing overwhelmingly stupid (little bit of a one-trick-pony, but that's all he needed to be).

I still don't really like Clegg's speaking style (due to the combination of it sounding jittery and out of rhythm and it gives me flashbacks to Blair's style). Cameron was pound-for-pound the best orator of the night, for me.

All of Brown's one-liners were well-written, but he made them sound painfully rehearsed. It was a shame for him, he had a good opportunity to pass off a bit of fresh and interesting, but he managed (as always) to turn it into the cardboard performance that we're all used to.
 
 
I agree with Nick.

I'm sure Nick agrees with me.
 
 
Sky and Channel 4 have Brown ahead of Cameron. The Sun (or yougov) and ITV have Cameron ahead of Brown. Clegg came out miles ahead in all four.

Those who like Cameron will fall for his rhetoric, those who dislike Brown won't be persuaded otherwise, those who like Labour will enjoy the substance of his talk, and see past his average oratory skills. Personally, I thought Clegg was the only one who combined both well, but the real test for Clegg will be the next two debates, where the two others will undoubtedly attack Clegg more often.
 
 
Gordan brown was just look tired and grumpy, nick clegg came out the best as he actually awnsered the questions and gave figures whilst david cameron tried to avoid some of the questions, like the house of lords and herditory peers.

Protip: Whenever Labour think of a new policy, the Conservatives just say 'hurrrrr 13 years', how dare you think of a new idea or try to develop existing policies you introduced!
 
 
Thought Clegg came across as a bit of an idealist really, he just said what the public wanted to hear. I think Cameron came across as the best as I think his plans of solving the problems of the country do hit people in some ways, but they're necessary evils. Brown's plans do hit people as well, but Conservative policies seem to work better.

All Cameron did was try to arse on about "the tax on jobs" at every opportunity, even when it didn't relate to the topic of discussion.

He definately came off the worst.

Also, both Cameron and Brown made themselves look nobs by trying to agree with Nick Clegg at every possible opportunity.

Where as Tory supporters always abstain from mocking and criticizing labour...............
 
 
Luckily no-one outside this site really cares what this site thinks. Nick Clegg appeared good quite simply because he isn't going to win - no one challenged him. Gordon Brown agreed with everything he said and Cameron was too busy attacking Brown to care about what Clegg was saying.

I can assure you now Clegg has proven him to be quite a force in his own right, Cameron and Brown will be attacking him much more next debate. I think he was under-estimated, and this will be addressed next time.

Ultimately this first debate has further confirmed that Cameron will win the election. On the whole, Cameron did pretty well, and Brown did pretty poorly. As the race has always between Cameron and Brown, Cameron is still the winner on this one.
 
 
I think Clegg kicked both their arses...and they should have had it coming! And the fact that Brown kept refering to Clegg and agreeing with him is showing a major weakness......
As with Cameron, he showed optimism big time which is what this country needs, but he seems to be rubbing up to people tooo much to a point where its cheesy!!
Brown was just sniggering and smiling all the way through...this isnt some comedy show, plus I thought Brown would do well in this TV debate but after last night I am beginning to wonder whether I should support labour anymore.
Just one more thing...the whole TV debate was run by bureaucrats...the public should have been given the opportunity to ask further questions, and the three leaders should have known better to advise ITV1 that they should allow questions from the public. After all it is us who matters the most!

You're right, because Cameron actually had the balls compared to Brown to argue against Clegg. Brown appeared as nothing more than a suck up to Clegg in case of a hung parliament. It was abundently clear.
 
 
Clegg+Cameron>>>>>>>>>>Brown.

WOW!  
He just kept of avoiding the questions, and responded back with..."what Gordon Brown is proposing is that you spend now, pay huge taxes later". What I liked most was how GB shunned his points with the smiling

Clegg did very well, but then again he was always going to. The Lib Dems haven't been in power in decades, they've got nothing to lose. The trinity proposal however is incredibly wrong for our current economy.
Cameron was excellent imo. He held back from attacking openly like Brown, put across the most appealing points and argued the opposing points put against him well.

 

Held off from attacking people personally? If the giant billboards in practically every town in Britain are not a personal attack then I don't know what is. In the debate, he blamed Gordon Brown and Labour for loads of things! I can't recall the whole debate but from what I remember Cameron was the one who had to resort to bringing down other parties the most.

I think Cameron was the least composed, with Brown in the middle then Clegg. As you say Clegg has every reason to be composed and confident as he has nothing to lose. Cameron looked nervous and he didn't answer Gordon Brown about funding for public services. His referral to the National Insurance rise as a 'job tax' is clearly scare mongering. And considering Brown used to be the Chancellor of the Exchequer I think we can safely assume he knows more about economics than Cameron.

I agree with some of Cameron's policies, but he comes across as a man who wants power for himself, whereas the other two seem more like leaders who want to make a difference. Brown outlined future plans and gave a specific time frame for when they would come into place if Labour were elected again.

Overall, I think Brown did very well, especially considering he had the mistakes of Tony Blair to answer for.

Just another point, did anyone else notice at the end when Brown went to shake hands with the audience and Clegg and Cameron hesitated and stayed on the stage? Did Brown break the rules?
 
 
The beginning was like the X Factor. I gave up after that.
 
 
I thought Brown stooped very low when he sid to Cameron that he can't airbrush his polices like he airbrushed his face on his adverts. Although the comment was true and funny I felt that there was no need for it as he just came across as a cheap bully

Brown constantly attacked the Tories' £6 billion proposed cut, but ignored the fact that Clegg kept promising a £15 billion cut. Wish he'd stop trying to cosy up to the Lib Dems.

Plus the fact that he repeatedly said things like 'I'm tough on discipline' but offered no evidence to support it. And saying about all the 'changes' he wants to make - well, he's had 13 years to put these changes into place - he should've done it then.
 
 
I thought Clegg came across as the best speaker, particularly during the earlier parts. Tbh though, he had a fairly easy time compared to Cameron. Brown spent half the debate debate trying to destabilise Cameron and sucking up to Clegg. The other half was spent making a strange expression with his mouth after every word.

I wish people would stop blaming everything on Gordon Brown. If you want to blame anyone, then blame Blair! Brown has not been in power for the last 13 years, Labour have. You can't blame everything on Brown! Sorry, rant over  .

True, but he has been in power for 3 years, which is more than enough time to start implementing some of his plans.

I completely agree, it just annoys me that people blame him for every mistake Labour has made when he pretty much inherited all of them from Blair  . The poor man came into power and had loads of problems to fix. I think he's done well not to let this country completely collapse.

I don't know exactly what he's done (since I've only just properly got into politics), but he seemed to have pretty convincing evidence that things have improved since he was in power in the debate on Thursday. And he said more needs to be done, suggesting he has more ideas.

Since Gordon Brown came into power, he's passed: A bill stating homes must be sold with HIPs which cost about £350. A bill stating the minimum vitamins required in margarine - great use of your time there Gordon. The digital economy bill. 2,832 new laws in his first year in power. (  Source  ) A bill stating that MPs are exempt from the freedom of information act Just to name a few.

The HIP costs money, yes, but it is a positive development because now it's harder to lie when you sell your home.

The margarine one is pretty ridiculous, I'll grant you that.

I agree with the digital economy bill, illegal downloads are terrible.

The last one will change in light of the expenses scandal.

HIPs cost an excessive amount of money and don't tell you anything different to a survey of the house.

I agree with parts of the digital economy bill, but it was rushed through so quickly and with massive scepticism (sp?) on large proportions of it's detail. Experts have said there will be innocent people losing their internet connection.

I'll believe that when I see it.

If innocent people lose their connection then I'd like to hope that some sort of amendment will be made in the future when the new government comes in.

And I'll also believe it when I see it, but I think politicians has some major changes to make if they want to gain even a small amount of trust back from the public. Making it compulsory to publish expenses will probably be a good move for them, as long as they all follow the rules.

Cameron did marvelously well in this debate, and he was rather strong last debate also. As expected, Clegg and Brown were sucking up to each other and quite franky merged into one very uninspiring and dull presence - I dread a hung parliament with these pillocks.

Luckily David Cameron is a brilliant leader, a credit to his party and his country and the majority of the UK will be out in force on May the 6th to cast their vote for the Conservatives. Good bye Brown!
 
 
so basically the people who were going to vote labour or lib dems think cameron did poorly whilst the people who were going to vote conservatives think he did really quite well.

I'm so glad we could have a debate to clarify this.
