Once Britain & America have finished the war in Libya, Iraq and Afghanistan they need to democratize and establish order in the following unstable countries where its citizens are not free:

Algeria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Brunei, Burundi, Camboia, Cameroon, Central African Rep, Chad, Congo, Cuba, Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethipia, Fiji, Gambia, Kazakhstan, Laos, Myanmar, North Korea, Oman, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, Swaziland, Tunisia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Yemen, Vietnam, Zimbabwe.

We did it for the Libyans, we did it for the Iraqis, we did it for the Afghans so these people deserve our help too?
 
 
I don't think all of those countries have oil.

So? It shouldn't be about oil. Britain and America promise freedom and democracy and abhor the lack of it. They need to take action.

And the world is made of candy bracelets.

Get real. We had a one off chance to HELP an already formed REBELLION, we did NOT INVADE OURSELVES. We merely helped an already formed rebellion take down an evil tyrannical government.

The West is not some superman we cannot afford to help everyone or even anyone most of the time. Be grateful we interfered here rather than nowhere at all

The US has overwhelming military power to aid these poor countries. There have been rebellions in Syria, can we not take down their "evil tyrannical government"? And the West has been at war every decade so they can "help everyone or even anyone most of the time". Let's not be hypocrites now.

It would require a ground invasion. Air intervention would do nothing in Syria as airpower cannot help in cities.

You don't understand much about the military do you? America can't run 6 or 7 concurrent military campaigns

I said after we've finished with Libya, Iraq and Afghanistan. And if it requires a ground invasion, so be it. The oppressed people of those countries have no backing whatsoever. With American & UN personnel and military power what could those governments do? The people would stand by the Americans and overthrow them. Nothing can beat the power of the people. Are you saying that we should let these people suffer?! Hypocrisy.

But they would't. Some of these countries hate the Americans just as much as the dictators killing them in the streets. the rebels in Libya did not even want US support till things got really bad.

The UN will not back any more interventions as China and Russia will block them. We help where we can thats all

Proof that they hate Americans just as much as the dictators killing them? It's silly to suggest they'd discard American aid when their freedom is being denied to them. Why would the rebels of Libya not want US support? After all, we are arming them.

Proof that China and Russia will block them? Why would China and Russia want these countries to be oppressed? Besides, where's your proof they will intervene? They didn't intervene in Libya, Iraq or Afghanistan. That may be because China and Russia are not controlled by Zionists.

So why shouldn't we help these countries?

Would any of them do it for us if roles were reversed.... Probably not so why should we involve ourselves in yet more business which has nothibg to do with us

You obviously have not been following the conflict in Libya if you think they always wanted American help.

  Just going to stop here. You know very little of international relations and politics I suggest you do some research before trying to argue about things you know little off.

well it would be a bit silly using that as a condition to help these countries as the roles arent reversed and we shall never know. How do you know they probably wouldnt?

What have britain got to offer them?? No oil or anything else of value so why would they want to help us. We don't live in a world where countries do things out of the goodness of their own hearts

we could offer channel 4 and its great programming? seriously though, this is what I was meant to be getting at. It is just weird to see people who seem informed, but who believe that such intervention from America, UK and co is completely altruistic.
 
 
We only interfere when its in our interests, or those of our allies. There are plenty of tyrannical regimes that are considered allies of the UK, and we arm them and help train their armies, or send our own people there to be tortured.
 
 
That seems like a great idea. All those Eastern Bloc countries will just welcome us with open arms. And those African countries with their proud culture who look back with such hatred on Imperialism and Colonialism? Bet they'll be real happy to see us plodding back on to the scene.

We cannot force the world to have democracy. For a few reasons. I think one of the most obvious is that the whole time we tried to do it we'd be accused of war mongering, oil hungry Imperialists. Just as so many are eager to paint us as with Libya. You liberals. When we're in Libya we're the worst kind of oil hungry war mongerers, and then you turn around and want us to do the same across the globe? All the while complaining about the government cuts at home? Proof if ever I needed it that limp wristed neo-Liberals have not a jot of sense. And I do mean Gaurdian readers here, not just people with some liberal views.

They? Why don't you join the Armed Forces and take action yourself; you lazy armchair general.
