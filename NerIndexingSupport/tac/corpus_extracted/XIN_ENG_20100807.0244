Tens of thousands of Chinese Saturday paid their last respects to Qian Weichang,
one of the country's most respected scientists, who was recognized for his
achievements in applied mathematics and mechanics.

Qian, a senior member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and former President of
Shanghai University, passed away on July 30, at the age of 98. His body was
cremated in Shanghai's Hualong Funeral Parlor Saturday.

The funeral service began at 10:30 a.m. Black scrolls were hung in the spacious
funeral hall, where mourners moved in lines and bowed before Qian's body,
covered by the national flag and among pots of flowers.

Top Chinese political advisor Jia Qinglin and other senior officials  attended
the service.

Jia, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), shook hands with Qian's relatives and consoled
them for their loss. He also extended sympathy to the family on behalf of
President Hu Jintao and former President Jiang Zemin.

Many of the mourners Saturday wore black arm-bands, a Chinese tradition to mourn
the dead, and held Qian's pictures and banners as they quietly stood in lines.

Among the mourners was Hu Yanpeng, 84, who was Qian's student at Tsinghua
University some 60 years ago.

"He urged us to learn more about rocket science and help in the country's
efforts to develop its own rockets," said Hu.

Qian graduated from Tsinghua University in 1937. He then studied in Canada and
got a doctorate in applied mathematics from the University of Toronto in 1942.

Qian returned to China in 1946 after spending four years as a researcher in the
Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, the United
States.

He taught at universities in Beijing and Shanghai for nearly 50 years.

Qian was considered a key contributor to the theory of elastic mechanics,
variation principle and perturbation method.

He was the co-author of the essay "Change the torsional twist," published in
1946 and considered a classic in the theory of elastic mechanics.

Qian once served as vice chairman of the CPPCC National Committee and then
honorable chairman of the China Democratic League (CDL).

An official obituary described Qian as founder of China's modern mechanics,
renowned scientist, educator, outstanding social leader, prominent leader of the
CDL and a close friend of the Communist Party of China.

In China, Qian Weichang was recognized alongside late space scientist, "Father
of Space Technology," Qian Xuesen and late nuclear scientist, "Father of China's
Atomic Bomb," Qian Sanqiang, as "The three Qians" in modern Chinese history.

Qian Sanqiang died in 1992 and Qian Xuesen died in 2009.
