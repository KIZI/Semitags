A Russian court on Wednesday opened a new trial into the murder of anti-Kremlin
journalist Anna Politkovskaya even as the case into the 2006 killing remains
mired in procedural squabbles and delays.

The new trial at a Moscow military court followed the supreme court's decision
in June to overturn acquittal verdicts handed to all the suspects in the
previous process.

However there appeared little chance of the trial gaining much momentum --
almost three years after the killing -- with her family and even prosecutors
saying an entirely new investigation was needed.

Politkovskaya, who was sharply critical of Russia's strongman Vladimir Putin and
his policies in Chechnya, was gunned down in the stairwell of her apartment
building on October 7, 2006, in an apparent contract killing.

The investigation has long been criticised by rights groups who say the failure
of the authorities to achieve any results has created a culture of impunity in
Russia.

The three suspects on trial are all accused of being accessories to the murder.
The authorities have failed to find the triggerman, let alone identify the
mastermind of the killing.

Chechen brothers Dzhabrail and Ibragim Makhmudov are accused of acting as
drivers at the murder scene for the killer, who prosecutors say was a third
brother, Rustam, who is still at large.

Sergei Khadzhikurbanov, a former police investigator, is charged with providing
logistical assistance for the killing.

All were present in the courtroom on Moscow's historic Arbat street which was
packed with family and media.

The two Chechen brothers -- who were freed immediately after their acquittal in
February -- sat with their lawyers on court benches. Khadzhikurbanov, who is in
custody in connection with a separate case, stood in a courtoom cage.

The Politkovskaya family's legal team called for the entire case to be sent back
to the prosecutors' office for a new investigation on the grounds that the
previous probe was flawed.

"The sole problem in this case is that the crime has not been solved and the
investigation is incomplete," said Karinna Moskalenko, lawyer for the
Politkovskaya family.

"Only the prosecutors can eliminate the problems that we saw in the previous
trial and we are seeing again in this trial."

Meanwhile, prosecutor Amaliya Ustayeva agreed that the case into the three
suspects could be returned to the prosecutors' office and integrated with the
probe into the suspected killer and the as yet unknown mastermind.

"I suggest that for the full investigation of the criminal case, the two cases
can be combined," she said.

Defence lawyer Murad Musayev said he would not stand in the way of the request
for the case to be sent back to the prosecutors.

"The desire of the bereaved is clear. They want an objective, efficient and
complete investigation.

"Sending it back to the prosecutors will not permit an objective enquiry but
despite this I will not oppose the request."

Judge Nikolai Tkachuk declared the trial adjourned until Friday.

Politkovskaya had written dozens of articles for her Novaya Gazeta newspaper and
a book called "Putin's Russia" accusing the Russian strongman of using the
Chechen conflict to strangle democracy in the country.

The murder last month of prominent Russian rights activist Natalya Estemirova --
who worked continuously with Politkovskaya to investigate abuses by Russian
forces in Chechnya -- has again brought the case to the fore.

Politkovskaya relied on Estemirova as a source and co-investigator in many of
the acclaimed reports detailing horrific abuses during the Kremlin's war in
Chechnya.

"The situation is paradoxical in Russia: the assassins of journalists feel
closer to power than the journalists themselves," said Dmitry Muratov, the
editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta.
