Switzerland.

Monaco is technically a principality, can't really say it's a 'country' as such but if you're rich and into the glamour side of life then it would be good.

It certainly is probably the most safest place in europe if not the world, heavily monitored and crime is literally non existent (except all the financial, tax, corporate fraud lol   )

My pick would be Switzerland of the two.
 
 
Switzerland is probably the cleanest, tidiest, most polite country I've ever been too. Iceland aside from it's economic problems is right up there the people are amazing.

Scotland... lol, jk, no, it's not a country

Could not be asked to write them all out.  
 
 
Probably Monaco, but most European countries are decent enough to live in anyway.

Monaco is a country. There's no reason it can't be both a principality and a country. It's sovereign and independent (albeit with very close links with France), it's a member of the UN. I'd say it fits the criteria of a country better than England does. "Principality" is just a description of their constitution, just like "kingdom" or "republic".

 
Except for 'UK'?  

 

Does UEFA consider each UK nation to be a country? FIFA doesn't, despite allowing them to have separate teams.

FIFA doesn't 'allow' us to have seperate teams. They can't do anything about the status quo and there is no basis for them doing anything about it. The Four British football associations were established before FIFA was.

Yeah I suppose "allow" was the wrong choice of word. But the point is an exception is made for the UK.

I just thought  this  was hilarious. Their standards are slipping perhaps  
 
 
Berlin, Germany
Vienna, Austria
The Hague, Netherlands
Copenhagen, Denmark
Geneva, Switzerland

or Monte Carlo  
 
 
Sweden - You get paid to go to university
Austria
Amsterdam

It's not actually, Hong Kong and Macau both have teams despite being part of the PRC, Faroe islands despite being part of Denmark, Palestine has a team despite not even being a country, and a whole load of British, French, American and Dutch overseas territories have teams, such as Bermuda, Guam, Puerto Rico, Aruba, New Caledonia etc. As much as Sepp Blatter blatantly hates the British he knows if he made any attempt to merge the British teams they would cause a legal nightmare.
 
 
Probably switzerland or Luxembourg
 
 
def not england, its ugly and miserable. and that's just the people. germany, sweden.

Ok, maybe there are a few other exceptions. But FIFA's rules do explicitly mention the British associations.

I'm not saying FIFA would attempt to merge them, but my point was that FIFA does not consider England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to be countries despite the fact they are separate members. Not sure what UEFA's position is.
 
 
Back to Europe: I would like to live in for a clean, relaxed life it would have to be Sweden or Germany;
For tax reasons and the awesomeness it would have to Switzerland for the winter and spend the summer in Monte Carlo, on my 15th floor penthouse  
But for the exciting life it would have to be Spain.
 
 
unless you've lived in all the countries in europe, i don't think anyone can say which is the best...
 
 
Norway
 
 
Finland
 
 
Finland is pretty good (benefits, free school and healthcare, nature, safety and that certain honesty in people) but I really would say that in a way Finland is really boring place. Winter is cold and long so you end up spending most of your time indoors   To me, Finland is a good place to raise your children but it gets pretty boring when you are older and trying to find excitement and you have already seen almost everything.

 
Sweden - You get paid to go to university

 

What, really? I didn't know this... I only knew that they didn't have final exams in upper secondary school and other stuff like that. But then again, in Finland some upper secondary schools give money to students that get a place in uni. It's usually something between 150-600 euros.
 
 
Switzerland and the Nordic countries.
 
 
Spain. People are happier here.
 
 
I spend 1 week per month in Switzerland due to my work..... I won't complain if I am permanently based there. Other than the French speaking parts of Switzerland, all of Switzerland is a nice place to live, work, play and probably retire. Austria would be a good choice too as does many parts of Germany......though admittedly to me the only part of Germany I would ever consider living in is in Bavaria.

Having said that, if you're fortunate enough to live in some of the nicer parts of UK it isn't all that bad, I'd definitely take Britain over France, Spain, Greece or Eastern Europe. Probably take it over Finland and Ireland.

Scandinavian countries, they are nice places, though some parts of Sweden isn't particularly beautiful. I like Norway a lot but I wouldn't want to live there. Denmark, it's alright but I generally don't like countries that are geographically flat.
 
 
The UK.... obviously.

Or Spain. Spain's cool.
 
 
Ukraine, specifically Lviv.
 
 
The Netherlands !!!
 
 
Switzerland - and I'll throw in the added fact that Youth Unemployment there is at 3.6% (2011)... even Sweden's is around 25%. And the weather is good =D
 
 
 
Money: UK

 

Maybe if you're over 30. Entry and mid-level salaries in the UK are some of the lowest in the developed part of Europe, coupled with high costs of living.
 
 
 
Berlin, Germany

 

You kidding? It's poor, dirty, provincial, and full of turks. Munich is more beautiful, Frankfurt has more business, Hamburg more flair, Stuttgart better food... the list goes on. Berlin is massively overrated, easily one of the least attractive capitals in Europe in relation to other cities in the country.
 
 
 
I am a bit bias but France is the best place to live  

Then it is closely followed by Italy (the women and general atmosphere of the country just rocks) and Switzerland (tax wise, it is desirable).

 

Italy is a disaster, it doesn't run properly, and plus the women are all religious and uptight.
 
 
Not PIIGS

why not ?
 
 
 
I'm a fan of France, myself. Nice is lovely.

 

Nice is nice  
 
 
 
why not ?

 

I can't tell whether you're joking or not!

Anyway:

Well it's really difficult to find a job in those countries for a start. Then of course there is the mass unrest and political violence. Would you really want to live there right now?
 
 
Sweden and Finland have the lowest amounts of corruption in the world so they must be the best
 
 
Denmark.
 
 
 http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/bre...-1226083171290 

Sooo. The scandinavian countries, Switzerland and The Netherlands are pretty good, apparantly.
 
 
I'd go for Slovakia. Beautiful cities, beautiful women and cheap beer!
 
 
I enjoyed Paris and Geneva a lot, but both very very expensive. I haven't seen the rest well enough to help, but if you like beautiful places they're both exceptional.
 
 
I'm voting Iceland or Norway.
Wherever is the best place in Europe, it certainly isn't this dump.
The only place I wouldn't move to to get out of here is France (because it's France! Do I need any more explanation?). I'd probably give Ukraine a wide berth too.
But ideally Norway or Iceland. I'd settle for Austria or Germany as a compromise, and I wouldn't mind seeing Poland. Pretty much anywhere other than here.
 
 
greece,the most important rule is that there are no rules!{or at least u dont listen to them}
 
 
I heard Germany is pretty good. They have a high standard of living due to not wasting money on the armed forces

Considering how much we bombed Berlin and the fact half of it was ruled by Communists it could have come out a lot worse. I love Berlin, much more exciting than any other German city I've been too. Although Munich was great too, with all the beer gardens.

I think anywhere in Scandinavia is best, but probably Norway at the top, it's ridiculously wealthy, there's very little inequality, beautiful scenery etc.

Frankfurt is full of drunk homeless idiots and has nothing to offer except skyscrapers. The old town is a joke.
Munich is okay but many people in Bavaria are conservative pricks, so no thanks.
Haven't been to Hamburg and Stuttgart yet.

You must have been to Kreuzberg or something in Berlin. Walk around the area around Kurfürstendamm and tell me again that it's "poor, dirty and provincial". I have no problem with turks, by the way. In my opinion, Berlin is a really awesome city and great for young people. Nightlife is amazing and there's so much to do. I enjoyed the overall atmosphere in Berlin and have to say that Berliners are probably the most friendly and relaxed people in any capital city in Europe.

A capital city that is massively overrated is Paris.

... that is why I said it had more to offer in terms of business. It's a good city to live in nevertheless, I very much enjoyed my three years of undergrad there. Not sure you saw enough of the city and the surroundings.

There are a few old grumpy Bavarians but you have such people everywhere, and at least they're authentic. Munich is the cleanest, richest, safest, and most picturesque large city in Germany, the quality of living is unrivalled (so are the salaries and - unfortunately - the rents). And I'd rather have a few 'conservatives' and a lot of 'new money' types than the narrow-minded Berlin versions of Geordies.

Other cities are just as good with regard to that, and you don't have to fear to be mugged all the time or step into some vomit on the sidewalk. Munich's beer gardens, lounges by the river, and posh clubs are unrivalled.

 
Berliners are probably the most friendly and relaxed people in any capital city in Europe.
 

Don't think you met genuine Berliners then. Almost all of them don't even speak English and have problems conversing with other Germans due to their ridiculous dialect. Bus and cab drivers had to be trained how to be friendly to passengers for the 2006 World Cup, no other city had that problem...

Berlin is a bit of a joke with the rest of Germany. The city is literally bankrupt, it lives off money transfers from the other, richer German cities. Its population is largely uneducated and lives off the dole. The dirt cheap rents (cheapest capital in Europe) reflects its true attraction, at least to Germans. Brits assume that Berlin is the be-all-end-all when it comes to Germany, but Germany is much much less capital-centric than the UK.

Okay, fair enough. We seem to have different perceptions. I only spent 10 days of my life in Frankfurt and about 12 in Berlin, which gives me a rather superficial impression of these cities. And you're German apparently so you have seen much more than me. But I stand by my point that Berlin is not dirtier and more dangerous than any other capital city and that Berliners come across as very friendly people. (Aber ich bin ja auch Wiener und hier sind die meisten so mürrisch und verschlossen, dass es nicht schwierig ist mich in Sachen Freundlichkeit zu beeindrucken   )

lol nobody eats frozen pizza in italy except as a last resort. pizza porta via shops are always open, so unless you're stuck at home on easter and you don't have a nice family to go to for dinner (which is unlikely for an italian), you don't eat that ****.
 
 
Canada!
 
 
Switzerland or Sweden seem like the best countries to live in.
 
 
The thing that's interesting about this type of discussion is that people in the Generally Praised countries (Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, etc) often report boredom, dissatisfaction and general dislike of living there. Switzerland in particular is notorious when you live there for having an overly strict, puritanical and fussy culture, with interfering bureacracy and unpleasantly fusspotty police and public officials. Sweden is of course very gloomy for much of the year. Norway I could go for as it is so beautiful.

What is the one country most people in Europe in polls repeatedly say they admire more than any other? Actually, you probably live in it. It's called the UK.
 
 
Although according to this global poll, the UK only ranks 4th in the world for being admired.

  I'm just going by the facts in the article, the Italian market for home convenience food is worth  €6.6 billion , similar to the UK, and the market is growing 15% annually; it undeniably shows a move in the direction of other countries like the US or UK. How else can it possibly reach the billions if nobody ever eats frozen food at home?

i didnt say frozen food. i said frozen pizza. moreover, convenience food isn't only frozen food - it's canned food and bottled food and **** as well, amirite? there's a lot of that in italy. i think if you draw a pie chart of the market divided into these categories, you'd find italy and the uk differ significantly
 
 
Not France, got French family living there and it has really good aspects but outside of Brittany get lots of arrogant people and service at shops etc is usually loads worse than the UK.

It's always a big adjustment going to live in a different country where the whole language and culture are not your native ones and people are not always happy doing it, despite the apparent global mobility that seems available. I see you're point but that said, a lot of people do make that adjustment and there are lots of lovely places to live in Southern Europe that many Northern Europeans live in quite happily. If you're not the tolerant type this will be tougher but there is so much to gain from it too.
 
 
 
What would you say?

 

Im pretty sure they did this somewhere if you google it, but i cba. I think the answer was sweden by that survey.
 
 
the north of England, I can pretend to prefer other places like I love Germany and Switzerland but there's only one place for me.
 
 
By statistics, probably Sweden, Norway, Denmark etc.

However the UK is pretty damn awesome in the grand scheme of things  . Statistically we may suck in comparison to our European neighbours, however culturally we are one of the richest nations in Europe if not the World, and we have a massively long and varied history that many countries don't. In essence, whilst all of our teenagers may be pregnant alcoholics, our healthcare stretched to the limit and our education system lagging somewhat, the UK is a fantastic place to live  .
 
 
Spain for the sun and beaches!  
 
 
I would say Sweden. I don't have much justification behind it, but nonetheless;
SWEDEN.

On a serious point, is it true that Britain has abnormally high rates of teenage pregnancy and alcoholism for example? I would guess they are average by EU standards but it would be interesting to know the facts.
 
 
England, because it's home, and I love it.

But if I had to leave, I would go straight to Switzerland.

If teenage pregnancy and alcoholism are things you consider, when considering which country is the best in Europe, then you have strange requirements.
 
 
Denmark  

Or one of the other Scandinavian countries.

On a serious point, is it true that Britain has abnormally high rates of teenage pregnancy and alcoholism for example? I would guess they are average by EU standards but it would be interesting to know the facts.

 

I think in terms of teenage pregnancies we are genuinely abnormally high, only behind the USA in the developed World and definitely leading the pack in Europe. In terms of alcoholism I think it's less clear i.e yes our rates are still relatively high, however many other European countries are catching up and statistics in many countries aren't recorded to the same level they are here so it's much harder to judge.

I think the extent of alcoholism in the UK is often believed to be worse than it actually is relative to our neighbours, because we often believe that it isn't a problem at all on the continent when in reality, it's an issue all over the developed (and non-developed in some cases) World.

This sounds right - my general perception when i'm in other EU countries is that there is a lot of teenage drinking and maybe alcoholism in lots of places, especially in Scandinavia and the Baltic countries, but i've also seen lots of it in Germany for example. Maybe the EU websites have figures on it.

I was taught in A Level Statistics and Geography that figures like teenage pregnancy rates are collected so differently and even ignored in many countries that it's almost impossible to tell which country truly has more. The US is infamous for example for under-reporting its incredibly high rates in many States because in Bible-bashing States they try to pretend that kind of problem simply doesn't exist and in big urban centres the authorities are careless about the state of large migrant populations and illegal workers.
 
 
 
i didnt say frozen food. i said frozen pizza. moreover, convenience food isn't only frozen food - it's canned food and bottled food and **** as well, amirite? there's a lot of that in italy. i think if you draw a pie chart of the market divided into these categories, you'd find italy and the uk differ significantly

 

And I didn't say that convenience food starts and ends with frozen food. I did say however that a growing market for convenience food is a likely indicator of a growing market for frozen food. From the details about Orogel on  this  page it can be worked out that specifically the frozen food market alone in Italy is worth 1.8 billion Euros. I appreciate that you contest that eating frozen foods = eating frozen pizza, though  this  website suggests that frozen pizzas were the strongest performers in the entire Italian frozen food market during 2010-2011, with sales increasing 6%.

I confess I've struggled to find an exact current figure of how much frozen pizza in cost or weight Italy gets through, but I did find research at  this  site which states that 45,174 tons of frozen pizza were eaten in Italy during 2004, which apparently was a bad year, down 4% on 2003, it seems reasonable to assume that presently the figure is quite a bit higher.

Even still, at 2004's rate, given its population at the time being around 57 million, that works out at the annual consumption of a ton per every 1,262 people, or 0.79 kg of pizza for every person. It isn't a great deal, I never claimed it would be, but the 2004 figure is 5 times higher the figure from 1990 (which had an annual consumption of  8,920  tons of frozen pizza). Everything from the recent figures seem to suggest that the trend has continued and the current volume is even higher. I never said that Italy was as bad as the UK, I only said that Italy is showing a decline in the direction of the UK, and I think that opinion was justified.
 
 
 
On a serious point, is it true that Britain has abnormally high rates of teenage pregnancy and alcoholism for example? I would guess they are average by EU standards but it would be interesting to know the facts.

 

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemi...United_Kingdom 

Teen pregnancy in UK is famous here, so I suppose it's abnormally high (at least I never heard our governments considering it an issue in France and I don't see it often in the streets). You are also famous for your high rate of abortion.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of...ol_consumption 

For alcoholism I don't think UK abnormal. Binge drinking exist among students in every country.
 
 
From what I've seen Monaco is by far the best but people underestimate how expensive it is. In Monaco there are 1000sqft apartments (average size in International standards of a decent apartment) that go for €10million+. Bear in mind that in Manhattan, NY and West End, London prices are usually £2-3million per 1000sqft. So Monaco can be 3-5x more expensive than the 2 capital areas of the world. Even a Billionaire could find Monaco expensive.

Apart from the extremes, the best place to live by far in my opinion would be Paris. I find London boring compared to Paris. Paris is so full of everything, but damn if only I knew how to speak French.
 
 
Definitely Scandinavia. Iceland is top of my list, it's peaceful, gorgeous and the people appear to be lovely.

Failing that, St Kilda in Scotland seems decent! Especially since I have this odd fantasy where I live my life as a self sufficient farmer, not giving a toss about the rest of the world.

Also, Paris is terrible! Never seen such an ugly place filled with horrid people.
 
 
I think in the end, ANY country can be the best as long as you have the money.

Yes there are bad sides to Paris, but that's because bad people, like everyone else, are also attracted to magnificent cities. I think you must have gone to the suburbs of Paris to have such a negative opinion  

Better than a boring ice-cold deserted **** hole though.

Um, Iceland isn't "ice-cold"  .

I went to the main tourist areas. I have no intention of visiting Paris again. Somewhere like Marseille though, I'd definitely visit.

Marseille is decent, but personally I think its more of a holiday destination, it's just too boring to actually live in.

Hasn't the entire nation of Iceland pretty much gone bust? Wow it must be a great place  
 
 
Why has nobody mentioned holland - AMSTERDAM!!!

What's boring to one man is perfect to another! I enjoy the quiet life.

Aye, but they're recovering quite well, and it's statistically one of the happiest countries on Earth.

How can Denmark be the happiest country when they have one of the highest divorce rates in the world?
How can Iceland be 4th? It is impossible to be happy when your country is bankrupt and your ruined. That 'money doesn't buy happiness' phrase everyone says is only half true.

How can one measure happiness? What do you class as being happy?
There are many people in the world that claim that they are happy but in reality are merely fine with life & aren't actually happy or are completely unhappy and chose to have a false front.

My cousin got divorced 5 months ago and says that she's never been happier. In reality she cries almost everyday, but never ever cried when she was married. It's kind of like kerry katona's show....she says that she's happier than ever (after her divorce) but everytime I watch one of her shows she's either crying, upset or angry at something.

I do agree with the USA being far higher than the UK. Everytime I visit my family in the US, it seems everyone is so much more happier. I always say....how can you tell the difference between an American and a Brit without hearing their voice? The American is smiling.

Tell me more about Sweden and Switzerland and what is good about each one please.  
 
 
 
It's always a big adjustment going to live in a different country where the whole language and culture are not your native ones and people are not always happy doing it, despite the apparent global mobility that seems available. I see you're point but that said, a lot of people do make that adjustment and there are lots of lovely places to live in Southern Europe that many Northern Europeans live in quite happily. If you're not the tolerant type this will be tougher but there is so much to gain from it too.

 

There's a big difference between being intolerant and disliking the climate and culture of a place.

If I was 'intolerant' of these countries or their people in any way I don't think I would have chosen to go to spend as much time in them as I have. ;p
 
 
Belgium is the best country. We have the best beer in the world, and chocolate, and fit girls, what more could you ask for?
 
 
Switzerland

Anybody saying the UK is a moron.
 
 
i swear all these nordic countries exaggerate their happiness in their polls just to gain publicity, they can't be that great can they? dark for half of the year, high divorce rates, high suicide rates, little culture.. says the opposite to me really
 
 
 
The thing that's interesting about this type of discussion is that people in the Generally Praised countries (Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, etc) often report boredom, dissatisfaction and general dislike of living there. Switzerland in particular is notorious when you live there for having an overly strict, puritanical and fussy culture, with interfering bureacracy and unpleasantly fusspotty police and public officials. Sweden is of course very gloomy for much of the year. Norway I could go for as it is so beautiful.

What is the one country most people in Europe in polls repeatedly say they admire more than any other? Actually, you probably live in it. It's called the UK.

 

Norway has made the top 5 "happiest countries" in the world list several times. And won as well. We are a nation of complainers, but all in all.. I think people are happy.

Are you from the North of Norway or the South Luceria? I always wonder how it must be to live in the dark parts most of the year - can't be very nice.

I met a Swedish psych student once and she told me that her lecturers assured her that Sweden is absolutely one of the most depressed populations in the world and that the only ones who remain happy are those who live in the Med half the year.

That's a lot of rubbish. Dark for half of the year? Little culture? It's not dark for half of the year, and we do have a lot of culture. Only Finland is very high on the suicide rates (number 14 apparently). Norway is right after Ireland and close to Canada etc. People exaggerate and generalise all the Nordic countries when it comes to suicide rates. The divorce rates are different in each Nordic country... Doesn't make a country "bad". The UK and the US etc have very high divorce rates as well.

Apparently the Nordics also have the highest autopsy rates, meaning that more suicides are discovered. In many other countries the bodies may just be recorded as accidental deaths as opposed to suicides.

I live in the South, on the west coast (and the climate here is very similar to Britain). Most Norwegians live in the south and not extremely far north. The climate in Norway depends a lot on where you live. Most of Norway has a temperate climate, and is a lot warmer than you'd expect because of the North Atlantic Current. It's not a frozen tundra like some people seem to believe, and there is no six months of darkness. Norway has four seasons, and the summer nights are very long and nice. The winters where I live are very mild and rainy, and white Christmases are very rare.

Really? I'm sure there are a lot of depressed Swedes, but there are a lot of happy Swedes as well (who don't leave the country).
 
 
 
Finland is pretty good (benefits, free school and healthcare, nature, safety and that certain honesty in people) but I really would say that in a way Finland is really boring place. Winter is cold and long so you end up spending most of your time indoors   To me, Finland is a good place to raise your children but it gets pretty boring when you are older and trying to find excitement and you have already seen almost everything.

 

There's actually a lot more events going on in Helsinki than British cities of comparable size (eg. Glasgow, Birmingham). The winter doesn't really affect how much fun you're having to be honest - equally you could argue that in Britain it rains a lot therefore you end up spending lots of time indoors therefore its boring.

 
What, really? I didn't know this... I only knew that they didn't have final exams in upper secondary school and other stuff like that. But then again, in Finland some upper secondary schools give money to students that get a place in uni. It's usually something between 150-600 euros.

 

All the Nordic countries have student support of ~£400 per month + free universities, enabling everyone who wants (and is clever enough) to attend university.

Well, the Netherlands are decent apart from Amsterdam.
Full of undesireable types.

yeahhh i know uk is high on divorce as well i wasn't comparing the them to the uk. but the days are very short in winter and tht wud depress me, that's probably why the suicide rate is high, but i take your point in that it's exaggerated. as for the culture one, not in norway or iceland but in sweden.. i went to malmo and it was just boring, there just wasn't anything unique at all. clean & modern i'll give u that, but it was just the same old shops u see everywhere, no little quaint boutiques or anything like that, modern restaurants and cafe's with nothing much about them. whereas here i just feel everything is much more lively and there's more character to things, yes we might not have the highest equality or life expectancy or what have you but i think britain is more interesting & cultured than some of the nordic countries

It's not unusual for people in Northern Europe to suffer from SAD or not feel their greatest during the winter. It may be a contributing factor, but I doubt that is the main reason. Several wealthy European countries with a milder climate have higher suicide rates. Norway and Denmark etc, they aren't Finland. People generalise all the Nordic countries and seem to think they're all identical. There are very big differences among them when it comes to many things. Malmø doesn't really have a great reputation (far as I have heard). But there are many beautiful cities in Sweden. With loads of culture and that cute Swedish charm.

Switzerland, Belgium, France etc.. All have higher suicide rates than Sweden or Finland. The whole "Nordic countries have the worlds highest suicide rates" is an urban myth. Denmark is famous for being a country full of happy people, and I don't disagree.
Danes are jolly nice people.
 
 
 
I just thought  this  was hilarious. Their standards are slipping perhaps  

 

Lol yeah, I love the advert they had on tv of a couple eating dr oetker pizza and a voice over saying "real authentic italian pizza" but at the corner of a screen were the words "made in germany"  .

Also I 100% sure if you went to italy and asked any italian if they have had or have even heard of dr oetker pizza they'd say no. Italians don't eat pre-made frozen pizzas from the supermarket lol.

That's like saying you went to Coventry and then making a generalised statement about the British Isles based on your experiences in Coventry.

Yeah in Helsinki maybe but there are a lot of things that don't ever come to Finland. But it has a lot to do with that person's interests. Some people feel that they can have everything they need here in Finland and some don't. It's the same thing with winter, some love it and some hate it. But were you here last winter? It was probably the coldest winter ever. I tried to cover my face with a scarf every morning and I still got some frostbites that seriously hurt. I'm usually that person who never wears hats or scarfs and still doesn't feel cold or get frostbites. And people who don't have a car have to wait there for a bus that may not even come.

Oh he meant support. I was thinking about something else...
 
 
I've lived in England (Bristol), France (Thoiry) and Switzerland (Geneva). Of these, I have to say I prefer England.
 
 
 
But were you here last winter?

 

No, I was actually in Britain where I got stuck in Birmingham for a couple of days Buses up North to Glasgow didn't run because of about 10cm of snow, ridiculous.

EDIT: Oh I'm sorry if I hurt someone's feelings enough to deserve a neg by saying that buses not running because of 10cm of snow is ridiculous, my deepest apologies

Same thing here actually, I (and actually a lot of students/teachers) missed their lessons because busses and especially trains didn't show up. One girls missed her matriculation examinations because her car just froze in the middle of a road because it was too cold. ILufe would be much more comfortable if there would only be spring and autumn all the time  

Nowadays people on TSR neg almost anything...
