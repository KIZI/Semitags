"Julie & Julia" has set off a wave of Julia Child love that will
wash over a new generation of cooks.

But will they dig into "Mastering the Art of French Cooking," as Julie
Powell did? I bet not so much. When baby boomer moms point their favorite
20-somethings toward old J.C. cookbooks, they just might find the
less-imposing "Julia & Company" (1978) and "Julia Child & More
Company" (1980). They're chockablock with photos. In them, she looks to be
the very model of an energetic, confident woman. And one who's having
fun.
