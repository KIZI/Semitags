 
 
Which country in the world is at MOST peace?
 
 
That is no internal divisions or being involved in any wars etc.
 
 
Yemen.
 
 
Sweden and Norway?
 
 
Vatican City.
 
 
3rd world countries
 
 
Switzerland. Always Switzerland.
 
 
Israel
 
 
I was going to smartly say Vatican City too. But I was beaten to it. Still it's probably true.
 
 
Costa Rica. As far as I'm aware, it has no military, and it has remained largely neutral.

Plus, QI said so. And QI is never wrong.
 
 
Canada.
 
 
I don't think the Catholic Church is a great example of not having internal divisions.

Don't really know about their internal politics, but for the past couple of hundred years, considering the wars going on around them, it's pretty amazing Switzerland stayed neutral.
 
 
New Zealand
 
 
Switzerland
 
 
We're pretty safe over here in Switzerland.

We're neutral. And we have everyones money!  
 
 
New Zealand?

Edit: Beaten to it!
 
 
Luxembourg.

I'm going to go for Iceland, they have a few sea-fishing disputes but apart from that all is well (except for the economy thing, actually maybe Iceland isn't a great answer).

You got to be kidding  

ROI isn't as bad as far as I'm aware, but NI? There's not so much violence, but it's still pretty volatile at times when it comes to politics. We got power sharing and then everyone started huffing over not getting what they wanted, so everything fell apart for a while

I agree with the guy who said Bhutan, it's a little Buddhist kingdom hidden in the mountains and nobody cares about it.

Perhaps Singapore as well, all sorts of races there and they all get on in harmony.

Regarding the money I would change the sentence to: We have everybody's illicit cash.

Machiavelli said that the Swiss are strongly armed and completely free. Having lived in Switzerland, I guess I have an ok perspective. The country is gorgeous, indisputable natural beauty, but I would not consider them free and to an extent not even neutral. This is a personal honest opinion and I hope no one is offended by it, but I believe(generalizing here for sake of argument) people live in a rather oppressed social mode and can at times be very close-minded. One thing that was disturbing to me, I have lived in a few countries and I felt the most unwelcome in Switzerland, to a point that many of the encounters and interactions I had with locals(and I lived in different places, Geneva, Lausanne, Zurich, Verbier, Fribourg and Montreux) were negative, and i found a lot of xenophobic people. In their defense the younger crowd is a lot more accepting and open-minded, and in the end I do find Switzerland a great place to live! You certainly feel safe, safer than most places I have been, and that is certainly a blessing.

In the end Switzerland cannot be a neutral country, it ends up taking sides(multiple at times), and facilitating illicit financial activities that sometimes fund illegal wars. I am sorry but those are not neutral actions.

The Vatican city is out of question, the amount of blood shed over that ideology sort of invalidates their position as a peaceful state. And the funny thing is that they use Swiss guards for protection, isn't that ironic?

Tanzania is one of the most peaceful countries in Africa, they are one of the few countries that have not had a civil war, though they are the 2nd poorest country in africa, there has never been any "Blood diamonds" or anything else as such.
 
 
safest places are gaza if you are pro-Palestine
and at the line of control in kashmir near pakistan if you are pro-india
if you are white then in taliban's nwfp
and also chinese occupied tibet if you are pro-tibet
 
 
Switzerland, which is why it's so damned boring here (half joking). That said, they've had their moments, the Swiss. Back in 1848 things got so exciting between the conservative Catholics and the liberals that they even had a civil war! That said, it was a very Swiss civil war: it lasted less than a month and there were only about 100 casualties.
 
 
switzerland.
or
england....everyone pretends to be annoyed about everything but secretly are quite content with corrie and a nice cup of tea ^^

How do you mean at peace? Many of you mentioned Scandinavian countries, but both Sweden and Denmark have had their flags burned in Arabic countries because of the Muhammad pictures. Both countries have troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, if this is an important factor for peace. I don't know about Norway but they seem to keep to themselves and their oil.

In Europe I'd say:
Sweden
Denmark
Norway
Iceland
Luxembourg
Switzerland
Portugal

On the other hand, if you long for some *explosive* holidays, try Spain

Mongolia

when i saw the place reminded me of a mini switzerland but without trains, plus with an area so small i can imagine the killings and crime to be considerably low. plus the chance to be in vienna one day, and zurich the next... best of both worlds  
 
 
America.
 
 
Iceland / Switzerland / Sweden / Norway.. Most of the Scandinavian countries which aren't linked to Russia.

I think there are at least *some* people who would love to see that place gone; eg Ian Paisley, and probably most of the DUP:

"In 1988, when Pope John Paul II delivered a speech to the European Parliament, Paisley shouted "I Denounce you as the AntiChrist!" and held up a red poster reading "Pope John Paul II ANTICHRIST" in black letters."
 
 
Wales
 
 
Denmark.
 
 
Brunei.... see it is so peaceful noone seems to know it exsists.
Also its full name (Brunei Darrusalam) Means Brunei;The abode of peace.

(having said that there was a rebellion in the 60s   )

shoot... i was beaten to it...

That's probably why it is a peaceful country. Nothing of value has been found so there's nothing to fight for.

I thought of this but then realised Russia, USA, Canada and many other countries are fighting over who it belongs to, so not THAT peaceful.

um I think you could be unaware of this But... Tanzania HAS an abundant of Gold, and Diamonds, they are incredibly cheap for westerners. Since the value of them is relative to their country. Its only $20 for an ounce of gold there.

EDIT - which is equilvalent to a montly wage for the average Tanzanian

I don't see where people are getting the image of norway and denmark being among the most peaceful countries. They currently both have troops in Afghanistan, they had troops in Iraq, were both involved in the Bosnia conflicts and were also in the middle of this whole upset about cartoons.

Norway have also been in several disputes over fishing with Iceland and the relationship with Russia is relatively tense - with norwegian f-16s regularly having to escort Russian military airplanes on the very edge of norwegian air space..

There have also been massive riots in Copenhagen and Oslo recently.

So I don't really understand how they can be said to be the most peaceful countries in the world?

i.e. Japan, Switzerland, Norway etc,
 
 
New Zealand, Switzerland, Iceland and the various small Caribbean/Pacific islands that people forget about.
 
 
Norway and Sweden have big immigrant problems so I wouldn't cite them as internally peaceful. If they hadn't allowed the mass influx of immigrants in that they did, I probably would have said them along with Switzerland. The Vatican isn't really a country, it's a ridiculous church with owns a bit of land.
 
 
 
I'm moving to Bhutan. How are those monks going to fight my coup? Mwhahahahaha.

 

 

 

I'm going with Iceland. Sure, it, along with half a dozen other countries, thinks  Rockall  belongs to it, but no-one really cares.
