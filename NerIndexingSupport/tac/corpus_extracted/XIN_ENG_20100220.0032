Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal has said that the new constitution would be
promulgated within the stipulated time despite having less than 100 days to
accomplish the task, local media reported Sunday.

"It is quite possible to promulgate the new constitution by May 28. There will
be no problem for the formulation and promulgation of the new constitution
within the stipulated time if we sort out our existing differences and other
obstacles," Nepali state-run newspaper The Rising Nepal quoted Prime Minister
Nepal, who had arrived in Pokhara for the 7th convocation program of Pokhara
University, as saying.

According to The Rising Nepal , he made it clear that the new constitution would
be implemented only after the integration and rehabilitation of the main
opposite UCPN (Maoist) combatants.

The deadline for writing new constitution has been set on May 28, 2010,
according to an Interim Constitution of Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal.
