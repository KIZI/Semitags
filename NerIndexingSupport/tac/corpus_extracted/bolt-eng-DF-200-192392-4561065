 
 
Which famous person do people tell you you look like?
 
 
I think I'm a classic plain jane but today my new seminar teacher said I look like Audrey Hepburn, totally out the blue. Admittably a bit creepy as he probably "did stuff" whilst thinking about her 50 years ago but hey. I said "   I wish" and he said "well a slightly less attractive version admittably. Anyway time to crack on..." Bubble burst/pride gone/embarrassed in front of seminar group.

Do you think you look like anyone famous or do people say you do? Feel free to post pics if you're prepared to begin thinking you look like David Beckham only for people to say you're closer to David Cameron.

Daniel Craig.

Harsh! Although Hepburn is very beautiful, so a slightly less attractive version is still a good compliment.  

A few people have said that I look like Charlotte from Sex and the City, (Kristin Davis?) I wish.
 
 
Emma Watson!   If only...I really don't, at all  
 
 
Phil Jones ¬_¬
 
 
Robert Pattinson without the sparkling.
 
 
The one that I think is closest to me is Jon Rice from Job For A Cowboy.

Though some drunk guy told me I looked like "jonny depp from pirates of the caribbean" when I was waiting to get cash out one time.
I think it was more the newly acquired beard more than actually looking anything like him. I really can't see the resemblance myself!
 
 
 
i hav been told since the age of 5 [i don't even know how a 5 yr old can look like someone who is in her 20s] but yh.. that i look like shilpa shetty [the girl from big brother.. if you remember her ? LOL] and i find it so embarrassing because half of the time I don't know what to say as a reply.. i don't understand how she looks like me though.. she has a much darker & slimmer face :/

 

Ha! Yeah I bought her perfume for £1 from savers. Bless her. She's well pretty though!!!

Smelt like petrol. Which is a scent I could get used to, but didn't think the rest of society would so got rid of it. It was reduced from £20 to £1, and had a picture of her doing a bollywood dance on the front...god only knows what the little minx is up to now. Doubt she was able to retire from her perfume profits though

I just said, I DON'T look like her. People just tell me I do.

Like this:
 
But with no tattoos, longer hair and a beard.
Though I'd say I looked more like him a couple of years ago than I do now.
 
 
When I first started college everyone kept saying I looked like Ellie Goulding - I still don't think I do..

Kellan Lutz  

 
Robert Pattinson without the sparkling.

 

We're both adopted bro.
 
 
People often say I look like Emma Watson.   I don't see it and think that the similarity between my hair and the 'Hermione' hair distracted them from realising my facial features are entirely different.
 
 
Shaun Wright-Phillips, Max Gradel or Nigel Reo-Coker.

I don't look anything like any of them apart from the skin colour and height.
 
 
David Schwimmer and Hugo Lloris
 
 
 
Richard Hammond  

 

 

 
Phil Jones ¬_¬

 

  ???

 
 
 
Gwyneth Paltrow.

I don't see it.  
 
 
Seth Green, not sure why.
 
 
I've had Victoria Beckham, when she had short hair.

I can actually see it as we have very similar colouring and there's a definite similarity in our faces, cheekbones, face shape and also nose, but our mouth are very different and my skins much paler.

But I'm quite smiley and animated person whereas she looks like she's been carved from a rock!
 
 
The elephant man.

Basically what white people do with me is, any brown person they know, they say i look like them.  

So they've said Ciara/Afia/Amerie/Friedo Pinto.

Even though ALL these people look different to each other!  
 
 
 
They look completely different  

 

I know - don't ask me why they said it  
 
 
I've been told Vanessa Hudgens, Christina Ricci, Zooey Deschanel and Madonna's daughter Lourdes.
My favourite is Zooey but I don't really see it myself.  
 
 
Joseph Gordon Levitt. Frequently.
 
 
 
alright we get it, you're black, stop going on about it all the time

 

What the hell?   She was only answering the question. Someone's hardly going to say she looks like a white celebrity, are they?

Jennifer Garner--never really got that  

Also, the girl in the Special K advert, the one that got chased by the giant muffin...
 
 
I am repeatedly told I look like Ralph Wiggum. Yup.

Kate Bush, Audrey Tautou and a lot of Chinese women, confusing as I'm English (and don't really look like the other celebrities either!) but oh well  
 
 
 
Aha, yeee. Its more funny than anything.

 

You're right I just did it and my 4th result was 73% Princess Caroline WTF!?!?

I'm male.

On a better note, 76% Justin Timberlake.

I don't know. I think you're better looking than him though!

I first thought Skandar Keynes. But I think it's the hair and eyes.
 
 
Ricky Gervais...Ricky...****ing...Gerv ais

Ha! Thanks for the compliment and I think that's a very strange coincidence since we are both pursuing degrees in Arabic & Middle Eastern History.

I get Alicia Keys. I'm white, but there you go. She's far far far more beautiful than me but I suppose I have her eyes/nose/mouth (though she has nicer teeth). She's got the bone structure to pull it off though and I don't.

I also get Somaya el Khashab and Shakira when she had black hair. Do not look like EITHER of those people in the slightest.
 
 
My gran tells me I look like Amy Pond, but I think it's just because a) My name is Amy, b) I henna'd my hair red, and c) She's a typically biased grandmother.  
 
 
Napoleon Dynamite  
 
 
James May.
 
 
My GF's brother said I look like James Corden. I think more Johnny Vegas myself.

I did one of those celeb look-alike online things and my top matches were Jessica Alba, Princess Diana, Kate Winslet and... Ralph Fiennes? Yay - I look like a middle-aged man. Apparently.
 
 
I used to get the milky bar kid stuff a little bit at secondary school because of the blonde hair and glasses, but that was ages ago. i was called ian beale (that character from eastenders) about a year or two back, since i wear contacts and have been since i was about 14. The other day I got compared to Cook from Skins, not because of the way I look as such, it was more to do with the fact that I apparently appeared confident and self-assured (it was the first time I'd met this person, so i took that as a bit of a compliment... that i can make good first impressions :P)... plus Cook is fit :P
 
 
When I get my moustasche apparantly I look like Jeremih (the guy who made the song "birthday sex")
 
 
Anyone with brown curly hair; Benedict Cumberbatch, Chris Addison, JJ from Skins...

rachel weize, lucky you, she's a hottie with added sophistication, tres jolie
 
 
 
Shrek

 

I was relentlessly bullied by people who said I looked like shrek in secondary school, That film ruined my childhood   I think it was just because I was fat though as since I lost weight it stopped.

Nowadays the only celebrity my looks have ever been linked to is Denzel Washington (but I dont see how I do) and Eddie Murphy in his Beverley Hills Cop days ( I actually agree I look a lot like him, I was watching the film and thought to myself "hang on he looks familiar" then later my mum was like I saw that film on tv earlier and Eddie Murphy looked like you in it)
 
 
james dean once, not sure bout that one, wishful thinking,ha
 
 
Hayden Panettiere... Really don't see it though, at all!

Robin Van Persie, however I actually play football more like Emile Heskey.
 
 
Justin Bieber FML

Never been told I look like a celebrity, but off that site I got:
Patrica Clarkson, Kirsten Dunst & Beyonce Knowles (and David Beckham + Kevin Costner).
 
 
I've was told (when younger) that I looked like the gay from Westlife, but now age has hit and people tell me I look like Hitler.
 
 
Daniel Radcliffe  
 
 
A few people have told me I look like Billie Piper, Molly Ringwald (my mum really does, and I look like my mum so I can see that) and Francoise Hardy, although I don't think I look like any of them!
 
 
Keira Knightley (facially, I'm not as thin as her!   ). Was quite flattered.
 
 
Benedict Cumberbatch
 
 
Before I had my haircut, Rafa Nadal or occasionally Johnny Depp

I've had Johnny Depp more times than I care to remember, and more recently (thanks to my steel-rimmed glasses), that guy from The Inbetweeners (briefcase ****er, not sure of the actor), and to a lesser extent, Harry Potter.

Hilary Duff, if you count her as a celebrity haha!
 
 
Margaret Thatcher.

I'm not even white.
 
 
Janet Devlin, by about 20 different people, think it's our Irish hair, and we have similar eyes. :') she's so much prettier though, I'd prefer to look like her.

After a long time deliberating on how that could possibly be, I realised we have a similar birthmark under one eye.
 
 
My house mates are going to make a list...

So far:

Martin O'Neil
Fabio Capello
Simon Bird
Someone from Superbad  
Rafael and Fabio da Silva
Phil from Hercules (that was rather insulting actually)
 
 
Some sort of cross between Skream and the guy from Maroon 5 apparently.
 
 
2 people so far have told me I look like this random Turkish soap opera actress.

 
I wish.  
 
 
Some people told me I look like a fair version of Will Smith!!!
Is that a good thing by any means??

Without the voice and charisma, you are nothing.   Just kidding, you're a lucky guy.
 
 
Mike Phelan, haha!

 
 
 
Someone said to my brother that I reminded them of the young Margaret Thatcher in The Iron Lady - I haven't seen it yet.

Spoiler:
 

Other than that, I cannot really think of a time where I've been compared to someone famous.
 
 
I used to look like Emma Watson/ Hermione Granger... I went to the opening of HP sales at midnight in WHSmiths and got to cut the ribbon to let everyone in cos I'd actually turned up in costume unlike the other 4 or 5 people and I actually looked like Hermione BUT I'm younger than her so when say the fourth or fifth film came out I was at the stage where I looked like hermione from the first couple of films.
 
 
Not sure what her name is in real life but some say I look a lot like Pat Butcher.
 
 
 
Some people told me I look like a fair version of Will Smith!!!
Is that a good thing by any means??

 

Why is negative rating given may I ask??

If you're Bengali chances are you don't look like Jackie Chan
 
 
Howard Wolowitz - applying for engineering doesn't help.
 
 
Not me, but everyone tells my dad he looks like J F Kennedy. And he actually so DOES! When we go to America he always gets told in restaurants and stuff, one person even asked for his autograph thinking it was him (clearly she didn't know what year she was living in but hey ho).
 
 
 
Howard Wolowitz - applying for engineering doesn't help.

 

Is a fair version of Will smith a bad face?
(no racism intended please; fair version means I am just fair)
 
 
I get Alicia Keys a lot
 
 
Quite a few people have said I look like Paul Walker, I dont see it myself.... I'm far better looking  

Seriously I didnt think I looked like him that much until my opticians said I looked similar to him, I wear glasses though so  
 
 
When we were playing the best and worst celebrity look-alike game (where you get chosen a really attractive celebrity that you look like and a not so attractive celebrity that you look like) my friend said I was a cross between Zooey Deschanel and Russell Brand, which I'm not too displeased about. I mean, Zooey Deschanel is gorgeous! And if I had to be compared to a man looks-wise, Russell Brand isn't too bad a man to be compared to, he's pretty feminine looking.  
 
 
Justine Frischmann and John Taylor (not the strong jaw/nose on the latter, though)
 
 
People who look like me have no chance at fame...

Mwhaha.

(Though seriously, I've never really been told that I look like anyone, I guess I have quite distinctively odd facial features lol).

EMZ.
 
 
When I was younger, Daniel Radcliffe (Harry potter dude) - same hair and glasses

Now they say I look half Zac Effron and half Justin Bieber - same hair no glasses
 
 
Apparently I look like Marshall from How I met your mother, I really don't see the resemblance though; and just yesterday I was told that I look like one of the kids from the Disney movie The sword in the stone (possibly Sir Kay although my nose is not that big and I have blonde/hazel hair)
 
 
I've had Will Ferrell and Seth Rogen, neither of which I agree with at all
 
 
Tatyana Ali from Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. I don't see it really.
 
 
Christina Hendricks when I get dressed up for a night out... the massive tits probably help. Other than that, Daisy Lowe
 
 
I've been told I look like Keira Knightley but I really can't see the resemblance myself  
 
 
morrissey
 
 
Rochelle Wiseman. I look pretty identical to her.
 
 
 
Rihanna   alright for some.

A brown version of Daniel Radcliffe.  

Though celebrity look-alike website says Margaret Thatcher (   ) and Bill Clinton.    
 
 
I supposedly used to look like Daniel Radcliffe (when we were both 11 years old). I definitely don't anymore.
 
 
Back when Skins first started, I used to get told that I looked like one of the girls in that. One of the lesbians maybe? I can't remember. Also one guy told me I look like Taylor Swift. I don't see it though.
 
 
Kaya Scodelario

Spoiler:
 

I don't really see the resemblance myself but I feel quite flattered.  
 
 
Cleveland Brown, without the moustache.
 
 
Lady Gaga. It's actually gotten to the point where people call me Gaga now because they can't be bothered to say my name.

:/ (I am a fan, it's just incredibly annoying to be stripped of my identity)
 
 
Sometimes Tom Cruise. I probably here it twice a month from random people.
 
 
Floyd Mayweather. At least once when I have a night out.
 
 
I get Fearne Cotton quite a bit...wish I could dress like her though  
 
 
Chace Crawford and (more recently) Zain Malik...apparently I have 'feminine features' :| and look like them
 
 
 
yea, ive heard people with big foreheads degenerate slower when they have dementia

Justin Bieber  
 
 
A red haired Hugh Laurie. I sort of see it, but only just.
 
 
Vanessa Hudgens. Just the dark features I suppose.
 

 
 
 
I've had Stacey Slater from Eastenders, which isn't that flattering   and Christine Keeler from Scandal, which is a bit better. Someone once said I look like Debbie Harry, but they were wrong.
 
 
The Rock
 
 
My friend says I look like Imogen Thomas. I hope not, she's an annoying skank

Michelle? Cassie?
 
 
selena gomez?! flattering but i don't think i really resemble her... so many people have said it though, they need their eyes tested
 
 
 
Really?......

 

Yes, really. I don't see the resemblance though  
 
 
A few people have told me I look like a moderately slimmer Nick Frost. To which I don't know how to react.
 
 
 
I think I'm a classic plain jane but today my new seminar teacher said I look like Audrey Hepburn, totally out the blue. Admittably a bit creepy as he probably "did stuff" whilst thinking about her 50 years ago but hey. I said "   I wish" and he said "well a slightly less attractive version admittably. Anyway time to crack on..." Bubble burst/pride gone/embarrassed in front of seminar group.

Do you think you look like anyone famous or do people say you do? Feel free to post pics if you're prepared to begin thinking you look like David Beckham only for people to say you're closer to David Cameron.

 

hahaha, guess what, he's probably "doing stuff" to YOU right now!!!
 
 
Amy Childs from TOWIE apparently!
 
 
Florence Welch - i actually got harrassed by some girl when i was out around town one night =[ she wouldn't leave until i gave her my signature =\
 
 
 
Mr Blobby  

Also Shamu and the people in wall-e

 

  This post made me go "awww".

No-one's ever said I look like a famous person. I don't really think I look like a famous person  
 
 
This isn't me but my sister is the spitting image of Cheryl Cole. Seriously. One kid was gawping at her whilst we were eating lunch and her father apologised, saying that his daughter was convinced that my sister was Cheryl. She's been asked for autographs and everything.
 
 
My dentist told me that i look like Stacey Solomon, i hope that she was just trying to make conversation =_=
 
 
I've been told I look like Emma Stone and Kristen Stewart on different occasions quite a few times.  
 
 
 
Phil Jones ¬_¬

 

An ugly ****, in other words?

 

 
 
 
I've had clemence poesy once or twice. Didn't know who she was though so had to google her.
 
 
Alexandra Burke unfortunately I'd much prefer Angelina Jolie!
 
 
Chad Michael Murray -.-
 
 
Harry from One Direction  
 
 
Not strictly a celebrity but the haribo kid
 
 
David Beckham. Now who wants to go on a date. HEHE  
 
 
 
Robert Pattinson without the sparkling.

 

Wow...can we meet up?!   Hahaha  
 
 
Rupert Grint/Ed sheeran -.-
 
 
 
Billie Piper, I've got a wide mouth...

People used to sing 'because we want to, because we want to' at me  

 

She's so awesome. You should be proud!
 
 
Priyanka Chopra... apparently, quite a few unrelated people have said it. she's an indian actress...   I wish though.
 
 
My sisters tease me because my nose is on the large side and I have floppy dark brown/black hair.

They say I look like Severus Snape...

and I'm a girl...
 
 
Vanessa White from the Saturdays apparently, i fail to see the resemblance  
 
 
 
Priyanka Chopra... apparently, quite a few unrelated people have said it. she's an indian actress...   I wish though.

 

I just Googled her.
 

If people think you look like her, TAKE THE COMPLIMENT.
 
 
I've had a couple of people say Eva Mendes. :-/
 
 
A asian actress.. sonam kapoor
 
 
Zachory Quinto
 
 
I usually get comments about The Beatles, if anyone.

I am a massive Beatles fan (I constnatly read stats, facts, what the songs were about. Everything really) so I have my hair longer like a Beatle.
 
 
 
I just Googled her.
 

If people think you look like her, TAKE THE COMPLIMENT.

 

  never know how to react to compliments... but i personally don't see it  
 
 
Jourdan Dunn,personally I don't see it at all! :P
 
 
I have had 3 strangers come up to me on separate occasions to tell me that I really look like Emma Roberts. Personally, I can't see it but hey...I'm not complaining!  
 
 
I went through about 4 years of people telling me I look like Hayley Williams, people I didn't even know  . Then I dyed my hair black and people don't randomly approach me anymore.  

   

[EDIT] Don't neg me just because I used to be ginger! :<
 
 
Russell Howard. I look, dress & walk like him apparently.
 
 
Snow white.
 
 
When I got a haircut someone said "Wolverine" (as hugh jackman). I'd take that as a compliment  . I always wanted to look like him; I had him pictured in my head when I was cutting off my long hair, knowing that I'd resemble him quite well after the cut.
 
 
Brigitte Bardot...  
 
 
Cesc Frabegas
 
 
Will Smith

Spoiler:
Just uglier, darker, shorter and without the GAME
 
 
Effy from Skins or Ruby from Eastenders a few years ago.
 
 
 
Will Smith

sounds more like SWP
 
 
 
Effy from Skins

 

 
 
 
Rory from the Gilmore Girls- heard this several times. One time it was her real name and I was all oo who is that only to google and find out it's still Rory!

Also a British actress whose name I forget, old now but used to play Shakespearean characters in the 50's.
 
 
susan boyle. and im a guy.  
 
 
I've been told I resemble Moaning Myrtle before...
 
 
Juliette Lewis apparently. Don't see it myself.
 
 
Quite a few people have pointed out some famous Japanese women and said I look like them, but I don't think I've ever been compared to a Western celebrity.

It's slightly odd considering I'm not even Asian.   Must be my colouring.
 
 
have been told i look like nadine coyle by a few different people, think its my grin though mainly
 
 
kate winslet...  
 
 
Frankie Lamps when I have my hair cut..

Come at me Christine.
 
 
zooey deschanel, only in my wildest dreams
 
 
Lots of people used to tell me I looked like Anna Paquin (with dark hair, not blonde like in True Blood)

 

I have also had some random ones. An ex thought I looked like Renee Zellweger   and a friend told me Jenny Lewis (Rilo Kiley) reminded her of me. I love Jenny but I don't see any resemblance at all!

 
 
 
 
Vanessa Hudgens. Just the dark features I suppose.
 

 

 

you kinda look like sandra bullock
btw you're much prettier than vanessa
 
 
 
She's so awesome. You should be proud!

 

She's really cool now, but back then...  
 
 
 
Basically what white people do with me is, any brown person they know, they say i look like them.  

So they've said Ciara/Afia/Amerie/Friedo Pinto.

Even though ALL these people look different to each other!  

 

pix?
 
 
Leonid Brezhnev.

Adolf Hitler  
 
 
 
Florence Welch - i actually got harrassed by some girl when i was out around town one night =[ she wouldn't leave until i gave her my signature =\

 

I guess you can say *puts on glasses*

You've got the love  
 
 
I always get told I look like Kim Kardashian, which is annoying as she's a sl*t. And Holly Willoughby, who I looove  
 
 
I used to get told i look like Lucy Pinder or Kelly Brook a lot (INB4 "pics?" - I don't have boobs like theirs!)

Nowadays I get the Crystal Renn/Candice Huffine/Any other brunette plus size model comparison - mostly Crystal because i've got quite sharp cheeks and well groomed eyebrows.

 
 
 
 
I had a long list of lookalikes which an inexplicable amount of people have given me over my late teens. I've had David Mitchell, Richard Hammond, Pete Doherty, and "Peter Pitrelli" (The guy off Heroes, no idea on his actual name), each one agreed on by several people. The Mitchell one was especially popular, and admittedly the resemblance was quite uncanny. Thank god I've outgrown them now XD
 
 
Some people say i look like basshunter....i don't see it personally but meh.... I'll let you decide.

 

 

Do let me know what you think  
 
 
kate winslet.
i dont. my mum does though, when she was younger.
 
 
 
pix?

 

Erm, i don't think so love, what a perverted suggestion.
What would a guy from TSR want to do with my picture.... Hmmm  

On my profile on the 'about me' section, i've got a picture there. Check it out.  
 
 
I've been told a few times I look a bit like Jennifer Aniston.

Also once Cameron Diaz, and Rachel McAdams. I wish!

Someone drunk also said I looked like Effy from Skins  
 
 
Apparently I look like Cher Lloyd. This makes me want to rip my face off.

No way you're single then.

Absolutely 100% single actually. More through my own fussiness than anything, I have quite particular taste.  

Ideal man = Tim Tebow (including his "no sex before marriage" and generally strong faith. I'm a christian too, so it doesn't really bother me even if I haven't totally stuck to it myself)

High standard=good. The number of people who say they dated the wrong people.   I suppose I'd better contribute to this thread now I'm here. Apparently I look like Daniel Radcliffe/Hayden Cristian (AKA Anakin Skywalker). Not sure how I feel about this.
 
 
Drew Barrymore
I don't think I do at all but apparently so!
 
 
I've been told I look like a few people...

Trinity from the Matrix.

Nana Osaki (anime character)

Natalie Portman  

And my delusional father is adamant that I look just like Julia Roberts. Only with different hair, and nose. And lips.
So not at all really.
 
 
Simon Pegg.

It's the hair (or lack thereof).
 
 
Dave Grohl :/

when i had my full fringe weave it was Kelly Rowland, when i had some weird curly half fringe it was one of The Supremes (i didnt even know who they were), when i had long braids it was Whoopie Goldberg :P
 
 
A mix of Mike Skinner from the streets and Dean from Supernaturals. I'd like to think I'm closer to Dean but probably not!

But apparently I act like Pete Doherty without the Heroin.
 
 
One of my friends is convinced that I look like Catherine Tate, but I don't see it. My Gran says I look like SamCam, and sadly, I can kiiiiind of see where she's coming from

When I did my SAT last week, there was a guy who resembled him closely! Everyone tried not to stare...we failed.  

Though, seriously. His hair and nose and...EVERYTHING looked like Justin Bieber! He even had this hoodie on that I saw Bieber wore once.

Aw thank you! I don't look like that normally though   its about a year old from a photo shoot my friend made me do for her photography portfolio :-P she did all my hair and makeup and put me in a dress and then spent ages playing with the lighting and making me do all these poses and expressions   it turned out to be really fun though she told me off coz i kept giggling  
 
 
 
Even though we don't have the same hair colour I've been told Joseph Gordon Levitt, because we both have 'squinty eyes'... Cruel

I've been told I look like Charlize Theron (in looks and general style), which was a huge compliment   Also on one occasion, Scarlett Johansson.
 
 
I generally get some generic European person like Enrique Iglesias or that gardener from Desperate Housewives. I don't even think I look that foreign, I'm just dark and tall  
 
 
Avril Lavigne by a few people

People have told me I look like Preston out of The Ordinary Boys the most, also been told I look like Robert Pattinson, and quite a few others. But I felt those two were the ones I was most thankful for, so I remember those ones.

Oh god, I've had loads of comparisons to famous people, guess I just have one of those face's!

Main one I've been told I look like is Jay Baruchel, also Federico Macheda, although these 2 look nothing alike   Also on some nights out been told that I look like Hugo from Made in Chelsea and Zayn from One Direction haha

Also, my proudest comparison was back in A levels when a lot of people said I looked like Cristiano Ronaldo, although thats down to the fact that I had a very similar haircut to his!

Oh yeah, another one I've heard from a fair few people is Cesc Fabregas
 
 
Anne Hathaway, Hermione Granger, Julia Roberts smile, Chery Cole, Penelope Cruz, Jessica Alba

Claude Makelele
 
 
I have been told my many a people that I look like the infamous Thuvaa from who got banned. LOL like I'm that fat and tamil!
 
 
Tamver from eastenders / indian guy from the big bang theory.
 
 
I've been told Amy Adams and Alyson Hannigan but I think that's just because there are very few ginger famous people xD I don't particularly look like either of them (nor do they look alike)
 
 
A white Stevie Wonder, when I'm playing jazz piano. I don't see it though.
 
 
 
I have been told my many a people that I look like the infamous Thuvaa from who got banned. LOL like I'm that fat and tamil!

 

How can he be infamous if nobody has heard of him. Also you say you're not tamil but your username says otherwise, ergo, you must be trolling so please leave, thank you.

He is infamous in the UK, and I am not as tamil in comparison to him, because he eats fish curry every day whereas I alternate between that and mutton rolls
 
 
I used have "DAWN FRENCH" yelled at me around High School! Along with pretty much every other fat celeb anyone could think of. Teenagers are hilarious..

This is obviously utter nonsense and I no longer want any part of this childish drivel. Away with you sir, lest you taste the fierce pain of my riding crop. Good day.

A riding crop? How dare you strike me with that, I am no horse of yours! Now I would advise you to type into Google the following name, Thuvaarahan and as you see only one name is shown, the infamous Thuvaa21. Now that I have clearly wiped your face with spicy curry powder I advise you to go and straddle a horse (sexual implication implied)

A girl at college once said to me 'Oh you look like KT Tunstall! Yeah she's got like your dark hair and sideburns'...

some rapper called bow wow  . I'm not even black... though i suppose there are some facial similiarities
 
 
I've been told by two different people about 8 years apart that I look like a young Jenny Agutter. The first time I was compared to her as Bobby in The Railway Children, the second time as the nurse in An American Werewolf in London.

Here she is in neither of those films.

Depending on length of my hair; Keira Knightley, Natalie Portman, Rachel Weisz, Rachel McAdams, Audrey Hepburn and more recently (pixie crop hair) Carey Mulligan. Don't see any of it myself but can't help but be flattered xx
 
 
Avril Lavigne   and Kristen Stewart possibly just because I'm pale and look annoyed 90% of the time.
 
 
Animal from The Muppets. baha.

Funny you should mention this because I was told yesterday I look like some girl called Cat from a television programme Victorious, which I've never heard of. I saw her and I assume it's because I have bright red hair.

Also that girl who used to be in Eastenders, Ruby? Her name is Louisa something in real life. I've had that from about 5 people now o_O

So nobody exactly A list but yno. xD

I've been told I look a bit like Sophie from Corrie and my flatmate said Demi Lovato.
