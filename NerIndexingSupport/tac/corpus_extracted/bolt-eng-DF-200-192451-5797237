 
 
Who do you want to win the US 2012 Election?
 
 
I want Ron Paul - the most progressive, down-to-earth and quite frankly the best candidate in my view. Who do you want to win?
 
 
No one other than Paul or Obama. Any of the other GOP candidates would make things a whole whole lot worse (oh the terror of Michelle Bachmann as president).

At least Paul would do the right thing regarding foreign policies. He doesn't make sense to me in terms of economy, but hey, I'd rather have a president who does something right.

On the other side, Obama doesn't really do anything. He's a lousy president.

So, yeah, not much going on there. IMO, Obama will probably win it. But it won't make that much of a difference. He's not going to do anything.
 
 
Right now Obama seems best, and even thats not great. Better the devil you know.
 
 
Michael Bloomberg but alas he is not running  
 
 
Ron Paul.

But I'll settle for a second term for Obama as will probably happen, and it will probably happen because all the GOP candidates aside from Ron Paul are insane.
 
 
Hillary Rodham Clinton ideally

Obama out of the current lot

part of me wants Obama to lose and Hillary will stand in 2016
 
 
Ron Paul
 
 
 
Ron Paul.

I have to agree. To refer back to my quote in  2009 .

That said, I can't agree with Paul on abortion, but he's mostly ok on other things.

What's his view on abortion?
 
 
 
What's his view on abortion?

 

He objects to it under any circumstances; however, he doesn't believe that the national government should have any say in it, and he is prepared to allow each state to make their own decision (which is ok, I guess - better than Bachmann).
 
 
Obama, no doubt.
 
 
Michele Bachmann

lol jk
 
 
Anyone but Obama.
 
 
I don't really see why people outside of the US actually care about who gets elected as their President. They (as in most Americans) don't care about our elections.

Whoever they elect, it'll have little bearing on us except a few things regarding foreign/economic policy. So...
 
 
Ron Paul
 
 
seeing as the worlds going to **** anyway, we might as well have some bat**** crazy US president. Anyone who doesnt believe in dinosaurs and masturbation still running?
 
 
Ron Paul.

Clinton's election in '96 probably affected the Cuban more than the American. Love it or hate it, the American election has an incredible influence on the world stage.

I'd go for Obama any day. I respect Ron Paul a lot -- he is the only one who has stood to his policies and defended them without changing for political gains -- but he just does not make economic sense. He doesn't even believe in externalities! Considering the lack of options on both sides, I'd say Obama is the best.

Why anybody would vote for bachmann I don't know.
 
 
 
Why anybody would vote for bachmann I don't know.

 

Struggling to see why anyone outside of the GOP will vote for any of the candidates. I just don't see any appeal to the centre.
 
 
Rick Santorum or Herman Cain. Those two are the best.
 
 
Even within the GOP, I have trouble believing Bachman has a strong base. The primaries are a Tea Party spectacle, not a real sentiment of the GOP. There is a silent majority and they don't want another debacle to the order of GW.

Santorum and Cain are bloody idiots. 9-9-9 my hind foot that will work...
 
 
Obama out of the current crop. But I would like Cain to win because it would be hilarious.
 
 
Ron Paul, he appears to have more substance than Obama.
 
 
 
I want Ron Paul - the most progressive, down-to-earth and quite frankly the best candidate in my view. Who do you want to win?

 

Ron Paul is the most crazy out of all the GOP candidates. He wants America to retreat back into isolationism, which was disastrous for the world last time it happened in the inter-War period and will be just as disastrous if it happens again.

He is not at all progressive - he doesn't believe in Climate Change ( not that I'd disagree with him there ), or Evolution, believes that Abraham Lincoln was wrong to fight to abolish slavery, wants Air Conditioning removed from all army bases to save money (WTF?), and is opposed to government doing basically anything.

Personally I supported Rick Perry until about a week ago, but due to his dismal performance in debates and the revelation of the very distasteful former name of his ranch, he's lost my support. I'm now not particuarly enthusiastic about any of them - Obama needs to go, but Romney is so false (see the Youtube video of his 1994 debate with Ted Kennedy, and compare the opinions he gives there with the opinions hes spouting now) so I don't want him to get the GOP nomination.

I really like Herman Cain as a person, but hes not a serious enough candidate imo - running the world's most powerful nation, is unfortunately not quite the same as running a business.
 
 
Ron Paul

Ron Paul wants to make sure that American troops are not sent all around the world invading countries, inadvertently killing innocent people and creating hatred towards America. Isolationism is very different to intervnetionism. Seriously how would you like it if American soldiers erected a baracks outside your town, walked about your neighbourhood with guns and occassionally killing innocent people? America was absolutely right to stay out of WW2 until it was attacked itself.

Ron Paul more than anything does not agree with climate change activists. As they are basically people who want to use the power of government to get everyone to step into line. Which is precisely the opposite to what Ron Paul believes in.

It really does not matter if Ron Paul believes in evolution. Firstly it does not really effect his general philosophy and secondly most American policiticians are devout Christians anyway.

Abraham Lincolm did not intend to abolish slavery. That was not the intent of the civil war. The intent was to keep the union together. Ron Paul actually said that many other countries had got rid of slavery without a war and would have prefered to have freed men without killling.

He wants to get rid of air con because he wants to see the troops come home. They are not likely to stay for long if the high ranking offficers work in sweltering conditions  

Ron Paul opposes government doing anything that is outside of the constitution. Which is what every American congressman, senator and president is supposed to do.

Lol Herman Cain.

One of the many examples of his stupidity:

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGOU1...A4D98D1DA954E6 

Yes, you heard it right. He wants the oil companies (who cause the environment problems) to regulate the environment problems.

More examples:

If you're brought up in a poor background, blame yourself for being poor.

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHMEC8Xk9cg 

Doesn't know the constitution.

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrRtjlWDS4M 

I lol at Herman Cain being a presidential candidate, and winning the Florida Straw pole. Just lol. He's not Michele Bachmann bad, but still lol.

Anyway, regarding your points about Ron Paul: I generally agree with you about him being crazy in terms of the economy. I have no clue what he is talking about in those terms, seriously. However, at least he's honest. At least, he's not bought (you can tell because the institutions and all Republicans despise him). And I completely agree with him about foreign policies - stop spending money on stupid wars.

So yeah, I would love for him to become the Republican presidential candidate. Romney is as fake as you can get. Perry is just... no (read his latest book about Social Security and Medicare being unconstitutional). Santorum isn't going to win. Bachmann and Cain no.

Paul probably won't win but a man can hope. IMO Obama will take it all anyway.

I can't understand how anyone who works for a living would ever vote for a democrat. Why would you want to empower tax and spend politicians who want to rob you and redistribute your hard earned money? Unless you are some kind of lazy parasite that wants to sit at home and collect government benefits, the democrat party has nothing to offer you.
 
 
 
I want Ron Paul - the most progressive, down-to-earth and quite frankly the best candidate in my view. Who do you want to win?

 

Ron Paul is a full on libertarian, which is the basically the anthesis of a Socialist. Either you've had a change of heart, or you are not fully aware of the ideology Ron Paul bases his policies on. I know you have proclaimed yourself to be an absolute socialist in the past, and if you have any doubt about what Ron Paul stands for, know that I consider him to be the candidate who most represents my position on critical issues. We both know how much you have agreed with me in the past.
 
 
Obama.
 
 
 
Hillary Rodham Clinton ideally

Obama out of the current lot

part of me wants Obama to lose and Hillary will stand in 2016

 

hillary could still stand in 2016 even if he wins, presidents can't serve more than two terms remember?
 
 
Obama - he's not pulled up any trees really but i think he's a safe pair of hands.
The last thing the world needs is another Republican President...
Just glad Palin's out the running now.

That's the first time I ever heard someone call Herman Cain an idiot. Cain worked on developing fire control systems for ships and fighter planes for the Department of the Navy. That makes him, literally, a rocket scientist.
 
 
Yes and let him go back to that. But his 9-9-9 plan is so radical and so retrograde to everything the United States needs right now. First of all, he favors a return to the gold standard. If he did any reading he would know how crazy it is that we were ever on it to begin with! To think that our finance was regulated by the randomness of precious metal mining… Liaquat Ahmed, in his book The Lords of Finance, weaves the story of how the gold standard broke the world.

He supports the elimination of a capital gains tax, a 9% corporate income tax, and the implementation of a flat 23% tax rate on retail. He might as well be an ambassador for Goldman Sachs.
 
 
 
Lol Herman Cain.

None of these can hold a candle to when Obama said ATM machines and Kiosks to check you in at the airport are responsible for high unemployment. Dumbest thing a US president has ever said in the history of this country.

I think Morris explains this pretty well:

If you have made multiple posts on TSR in the past in which you specifically state that you have a favorable view of a diminishing U.S. influence. If you have personally on TSR reveled in the suffering of America's Economy. If you have implied on TSR that the collapse of the American empire is a positive situation for the EU or your own perspective country. Then your opinion expressed on TSR of which Candidate would be best to win the 2012 election is most likely not the best candidate for America or the American people. If they have any since at all, American voters will pay as little attention to the views of those who clearly do not have America's interest at heart, as I pay to your's

Left-wing politics is not pandering to benefits-parasites, no matter what Glen Beck/Rush Limbaugh/Bill O'Reilly/Ayn Rand will tell you.

It's about trying to make society more fair for those who are less fortunate. For every hard-working upper-middle class kid who inherits the family business and makes a shedload of money there's another man working 3 jobs and moonlighting just to feed his kids. Sure, they both work hard, but there's a dichotomy of rewards here. The upper-middle class guy didn't get rich entirely by himself. Without his circumstances, he may have ended up just like the other guy.

I see no problem with systems of support for those who need it, so long as complacency is not encouraged. I have an enormous problem with systems of support being extorted and systems that do not encourage people to work hard.

And what about the thousands each year in the US who die because they didn't have/couldn't afford health insurance? That's not fair. There are people who might work harder than anyone else in society, but they will never move up, and they will never earn more than enough to just about feed themselves.

That does not have policy implications and is a mere snafu. Cain's idiocy has pretty significant policy implications. Hah, 9-9-9! I in no way think Obama is a perfect president, but he certainly is not this much of an idiot.

Herman Cain is in absolutely no position to lead a country like America. Let him go back to leading his wonderful Pizza chain for god's sake!

And to the above poster: to whom exactly are you referring?

I agree completely. I believe in equity not equality. Right-wing nuts are a little too dense to understand the difference between the two. In other words, I support a system that tries to provide equality of inputs, or equal opportunity, it is for the person to do with those inputs what he pleases. This means that because I am born to a rich family I should not be at a significant advantage to one born in a poor family. This is obviously ideal, but it is not a bad goal to strive for.

That means we should not be providing unemployment benefits, but should be providing employment.
 
 
Cain becoming president would be a tradegy. Bachmann even worse with her devotion to Christian and homophobic views.

Pretty much all Democrats are pushovers. What did Obama do in the debt deal? Give pretty much what the Republicans wanted. Surprise, surprise. People voted him because they wanted change, and he hasn't delivered crap. Get out of Iraq and Afghanistan? Sorry, not happening. We'll stay a little longer under the pretense that 'trainers' are staying, although they're troops. Surprise surprise.

Still, he's better than pretty much all GOP presidential candidates. Everyone apart from Ron Pau, wants to cut taxes from the rich. That's suicidal for the economy in this state, especially when the last time this happened under the Bush-Chenney administration no jobs were created. Cutting taxes for the rich is wholly under the precendent that more jobs will be created, which is why Republicans don't have any evidence for this (when asked about this, they usually divert their attention from it). It doesn't work like that. Coorperations send jobs abroad to maximise profits and squeeze money out of the middle class with higher taxes. Have you heard what Rick Perry has said? He doesn't even want any taxes on the rich. Then, when the middle class ends up poor, propaganda ensues to convince them that it isn't the coorperations fault.

Just get Bernie Sanders as a nominee. Or get Weiner back. At least they have/had balls to stand up for what they truly believe in. Virtually of the Democrats now are pussies, which is incredibly annoying. They may as well be Republican agents.

EDIT: Explanation for the neg? Or perhaps a Republican who can't stand the truth?  
 
 
Depends who wins the Republican primaries. If either ron paul or mitt romney (despite his views on gay marraige) win, we could be seeing a new president. However despite obama having a turbulent end of 2010/first 6 months of 2011 (barring the osamanation), where it seemed he was ceratain to lose, the past few months I think he has regained much of his support. Whoever wins, it certainly wont be by a landslide.

TBH it's far too early to call.

Though I am very inclined to agree with you, I don't know given his situation how much more he could have done. I just think democrats in general are spineless, complacent, professorial, guys who want everyone else to defend them. They need to learn to get their hands a little dirty.
 
 
I don't think Romney can get the support of the independents as well as say Chris Christie, who we all know is NOT running. Ron Paul, the best of the lot, just isn't sensible when it comes to the economy.

Left-wing politics is not pandering to benefits-parasites, no matter what Glen Beck/Rush Limbaugh/Bill O'Reilly/Ayn Rand will tell you.

 

Actually that's exactly what it is. 15% of Americans are now on food stamps. A slight majority (53%) of Americans are on some kind of welfare/government aid. Roughly half of all Americans pay no federal income taxes. This is a very large group to pander to, a big enough group to get you voted into office.

 
It's about trying to make society more fair for those who are less fortunate.

 

By taking money from someone who worked for it and giving it to someone who didn't earn it? Doesn't sound fair to me. If someone broke into your house to accomplish the same thing he would be arrested for theft.

I see no problem with systems of support for those who need it, so long as complacency is not encouraged. I have an enormous problem with systems of support being extorted and systems that do not encourage people to work hard.

 

The problem is that these programs are almost always taken advantage of. On the morning US talk shows you always hear people calling in saying that they have job offers but the welfare benefits pay better. Eventually the host convinced a caller to take a low paying job so he could "set a good example for his kids"

On the other end of the scale is someone who is not going to start a business if the taxes mean it's not worth his time.

I think the biggest problem with democrats is that they don't understand how their bad economic policies influence behavior.

As incredulous as it sounds, I can extrapolate your argument to the fact that I am also on government welfare because I use government roads. Half of americans don't pay taxes because they cannot afford to pay taxes. The rich can afford to pay and thus should pay.

 
By taking money from someone who worked for it and giving it to someone who didn't earn it? Doesn't sound fair to me. If someone broke into your house to accomplish the same thing he would be arrested for theft.
 

It's about fairness not equality. The point is equalizing the difference between those who have opportunities and those who don't, this as it seems comes in the form of wealth and income redistribution. But the point is certainly not to redistribute for that sake!

 
That's actually a myth. Maybe in the UK that's how things work, but in the US, the overwhelming majority of millionaires are self made and weren't born into wealth.
 

Self-made, my ass! My friend's dad once came and told me that he was a self-made man and thus he should be able to keep his wealth. I asked him how much money his parents made each year, 20 grand per year. So he really did make it himself, right! Then I asked him, hey but wait, your parents would have barely paid taxes. Sir, I submit to you that if not for the fact that your dad was on welfare and your public school put more into you than you did into it, you would not be where you are!

My dad could in the same light claim to be a "self-made" man, but the fact is that it is the Indian and American taxpayer that funded his education and fellowship at university. This is the social fabric that we live in. In fact I would argue someone is more "self-made" if he is born into wealth and we all know what that's a pretty weak argument to make.

 
I think the biggest problem with democrats is that they don't understand how their bad economic policies influence behavior.
 

I think the biggest problem with Republicans is that they, as you have here demonstrated, completely incapable of understanding the liberal motive. My goal is not to redistribute wealth, my goal is not to end capitalism, my goal is not to close down Goldman Sachs. My goal is to make the access to opportunity, to the social ladder, equitable. But Government Goldman's policies really are analogous the the rich climbing up the ladder and pushing it down once they reach the top.

 
On the other end of the scale is someone who is not going to start a business if the taxes mean it's not worth his time.
 

Once again, very untrue. Over the last half of the 20th century, before our hero Reagan came, the top tax rate was around 91% and capital gains were being taxed at 35%. And yet a crazy amount of innovation happened! This is because many brilliant but poor kids were not being failed by a system that favored those who had already made it. It meant that everyone had to work their damned hardest to get rich. And once you were rich, boy you were fine! But getting there was fair. This was real capitalism. Now? America and innovation might as well be divorced concepts after the stupidly neocon policies of the Bush administration.

 
I am sorry but I have no clue what the hell you are talking about. What medical bills? Poor people get medicaid.
 

Like many others of your creed, you want to look at one specific point and fail to really understand the "big picture". Why do you think healthcare costs in the United States are twice per capita as in Europe? Because private insurers are not as efficient, figure that huh! They manage risk in a way that sometimes a third external party is bearing the brunt of the risk and thus creating a market failure. But hey, some conservatives have time and again shown that they don't understand externalities.

Now after responding to your clearly ill-thought propaganda I sound like a liberal nut! I'd say nothing could be farther from the truth because though I might be liberal I find much merit in well thought out conservative policies. I don't believe in entitlements for that sake, I believe the inequality of wealth is an excellent and motivating force, and I believe that the most powerful force is the invisible hand. But I do not believe that we should let this go rampant such that a few that have already made it can close the gate and keep it that way. For the powerful forces of the free market to keep working we have to allow new people, entrepreneurs, to keep taking risks and keep making it over and over again.

Medicaid would work if all the people who needed it could get it. Sadly, this is not always the case, and even the people who do get it are at greater risk, since the healthcare is not to scratch.  Here, take a look. 

I know that there are people who extort benefits, but just like how you argue that there are self-made millionaires (which at no point did I disagree with), it does not invalidate my point that there are people out there who are stuck and disadvantaged and there is NOTHING they can do about it. These are the people that Objectivism would leave in the gutter so that those who were fortunate enough for things to go right can make more than they will ever spend.

The idea isn't to just give it to them for the sake of it. The idea is (or at least it should be) to invest that money into schemes for getting people into jobs and giving people equal opportunities in this world. It's all well and good if you worked very hard to make your millions: the crux of the matter is that only some people are actually able to turn hard work into millions. For people in the gutter, hard work can do nothing but perhaps keep them alive.

Also, please source your statistics. I have a hard time believing that the overwhelming majority of millionaires are self-made; please, I would like to see your evidence.

(And as others have since stated, your statistic claiming that half of Americans pay no income tax harms your case more than it help it, if at all.)
 
 
 
Also, please source your statistics. I have a hard time believing that half of all Americans pay no income tax, and even if that were true that does nothing to illustrate your point. I also do not understand how you can possibly claim that the overwhelming majority of millionaires are self-made; please, I would like to see your evidence.
 

It's a correct statistic but it really makes no point. Just read my post. When the 50th percentile of income can't generate a proper lifestyle what the hell do you expect the government to do?
 
 
Rofl Ron Paul 'progressive'. Ron Paul essentially wants to roll the state back to a 19th century laissez-faire state which would be idiotic and harmful even in healthy economic times, let alone now.

Obama is pretty much the best of a bad bunch, the field is incredibly weak this time around. I really don't know why more past cabinet members don't stand in the United States. Here you can build up a decent political position through working in the cabinet and spring boarding off that but in the States it always seems to be random governors and Senators, who have no experience being part of an administration (Senators) or governing at national level (State Governors).
 
 
 
Also, please source your statistics. I have a hard time believing that half of all Americans pay no income tax, and even if that were true that does nothing to illustrate your point.

 

It's actually true. Although, that says more about people being unable to pay for the tax and the average lower 50% percentile income (which is absolutely shocking). They simply cannot afford anything.

As for his second point about self-made millionares, I'm not sure where he got that from.

Anyway, with the huge deficit, the government now wants to curb spending. I find this to be a necessary solution to reduce the trillions down the hole America has found itself in, but the wrong areas are being looked at. Social Security, for one, should be left. People pay their money into this for their whole lives, and now it's being cut? Bull****. It's their money which they should keep. The surplus is not meant to be spent. Medicare? The same thing. It should not be touched.

What should be touched? Well, how about that insanely high defense budget? What in the world is the point of staying in Afghanistan and Iraq when there is no reason left? Get the hell out of there and you'll be saving lives and money. Cut the defense budget and reduce spending there.

Furthermore, what is this Republican nonsense about the rich not being taxed? Everyone needs to pay their fair share to society - remember we live in a community where everyone should get equal opportunity to succeed in life. What is the difference to a rich person between getting income taxed 15% and 35% to their lifestyle? They will still live a comfortable life easily. Now consider much money would that generate from the top bracket. How much of a difference could that make to a poor person's life? Especially to a poor person who works ridiculously hard to succeed in life but barely gets by? What about a poor person who is ill but cannot pay for their medical bill?

No one is saying take 100% of the money from the rich. However, they need to contribute to society.

And we should definitely NOT cut taxes on the rich.
 
 
 
Firstly I've never called myself an absolute socialist before  

 

Fair enough, You simply claimed to be a Socialist.

 
Secondly, there is such thing as libertarian socialism.

 

Not sure, Just because someone calls a thing "Libertarian Socialism", does not mean it makes any since. Being that Libertarianism is the belief that the best government is the one that governs the least and Socialism is far from that it's almost like calling someone a tall short person.

 
And thirdly, I don't remember talking to you ever before :?:

 

I believe it was on the thread "Are private schools fair?" it was under the society forum. We responded on page 4,5,& 8. Check it out. I think you will especially like how the thread ended on page 8.

Oh yes, so we did talk  

I'm a liberal, non-literal Christian Socialist and a contrarian in many ways.

Not really. Look it up.
 
 
 
Anyway, regarding your points about Ron Paul: I generally agree with you about him being crazy in terms of the economy. I have no clue what he is talking about in those terms, seriously. However, at least he's honest. At least, he's not bought (you can tell because the institutions and all Republicans despise him).

 

Ron Paul is a disciple of Austrian economics. A school of thought that has has historically been quite robust, atleast in comparison to Monetarism and Keynesianism, and is yet still not mainstream.

Ron Paul is the only candidate, and this really says something, who talks about monetary policy seriously. He actually takes on the FED. Most other politicians discuss meaningless technicalities over fiscal policy and supply side policy. Ron Paul is the only man intellectual and brave enough in American politics to take on the FED.

I want Ron Paul - the most progressive, down-to-earth and quite frankly the best candidate in my view. Who do you want to win?

 

Not sure how Ron Paul is progressive in any sense of the word? I find it difficult to support someone who wants to abolish the American central bank and adopts such an ultra-isolationist standpoint on American Foreign policy. I'll agree that its refreshing that he is someone who sticks to his beliefs no matter what, but why do they have to be so ridiculous? Have you heard him during the Republican primary debates, he's pretty hard to even understand and his talking seems more of a stream of conciousness.

Romney has a good shot at winning against Obama, but will have a difficult time gaining the Republican nomination.

I think I'd still support Obama because the direction the Republican party is moving in worries me. I'd be worried about the risk that Romney would start to appease Tea Party republicans if he got into the White House.
 
 
Mickey Mouse, who to be honest is probably a far more popular American than any of the presidential candidates will ever be.

Ron Paul is progressive because he's a lot more laid-back, and suited for modern, more liberal, politics. His views are not extreme, but intelligent and not based on fundamentalist religion. He is in my view, the best candidate.

Ron Paul is a libertarian, close to the polar opposite of progressives who believe that government action is the best way to bring about change and reform. According to his voting record he is the most conservative member of congress since 1937.

His views are extreme, he advocates a strict following of the American constitution which would shrink the size of the federal government to a level which is unthinkable. America in 2011 with it 350 million population cannot have a federal government with the same powers which it had in 1776 with a population of 2.4 million. If it did then the US would probably fall apart.

He also wouldn't allow Congress to pass any bill unless it was explicitly given that power in the American constitution. Such a strict following of the constitution which was created in 1787 hardly seems appropriate for 2011. Comparisons can be made with fundamentalist religion here as they strictly follow the most traditional interpretations of their religion. Instead Ron Paul adheres to the American Constitution religiously.

His economic views are also extreme, as he is strictly against any Keynesian or Monetarist economic policies. He would therefore abolish the American Central bank which is the only thing keeping the economy going right now.

I agree you that the socially conservative ultra-religious republicans are categorically bad for America. But there are many other types of more central conservatives, like Mitt Romney, but their views are often drowned out when they cross the Atlantic by people like Michele Bauchmann who represent only a minority of the American population.

It is refreshing to have Ron Paul stick to his ideals, but his political stances on foreign policy, social policy and economics are not appropriate for the 21st century. He has always been and will continue to be a fringe presidential candiate.

Mitt Romney, though more moderate, really isn't all that moderate. He was tempered as Governor of Massachusetts by that population, nicknamed Taxachusetts, because of how liberal it is. If he is tempered by a far more conservative general population he will be far more able to follow his personal ideology.

I'd definitely agree that Romney tends to change his tune to appease whoever his voting base is. At the moment, his voting base is the very socially conservative Republicans who vote in the Republican presidential primaries, so he often sounds quite socially conservative.

But if he does get the nomination, he will be facing the entire country, where he will undoubtedly reposition himself as more moderate (especially compared to the Republican party today) because whoever wins the 2012 Presidential Election will be whoever appeals to the moderate independent voters the most. (As is the case in the UK and most democracies).

Sorry I've misunderstood what you've said by the way, I wasn't 100% sure if you were saying he is actually very conservative or actually quite liberal.
 
 
People are far too gullible when it comes to Ron Paul... He's not much better than any other Republican candidate.

Obama ftw.
 
 
By the way, who else was amused by Sarah Palin's blatant abuse of Sarahpac and the robbery of her campaign donors? She basically pretended to be running for President, got people to pay her a lot of money, and is now not running and keeping the money. Hah.
 
 
Definately Ron Paul. He is one of the very rare politicians who has managed to excell in politics without sacrificing his soul and selling out on his principles along the way. You get a sense that through the pursuit of liberty his only concern is the wellbeing of the people, and that is obviously a great thing. Ron Paul is not perfect but he's pretty darn close, oh how I wish we had some big libertarian politicians in this country to vote for.
The others, I hate, including Obama, Perry, Santoram, Bachmann, etc. I don't mind Obama's social policy but his economic policy is absolutely terrible in my opinion. Whereas the GOP candidates, except Paul, I agree with economically but not socially. I don't mind Romney though.

Don't a lot of candidates do this though? Quite a few drop out because they can't raise the money and I always assumed they don't pay it back.
 
 
Anyone as long as it ain't Palin or Obama.

Ah if dreaming is allowed Bill Clinton or Gavin Newsom!
 
 
i like a lot of what ron paul says but i would never vote for a creationist, or a pro-lifer.

even though obama is disappointing, any sane person shouldnt vote republican given the candidates on offer at the moment, and the general state of the party itself.
 
 
I really don't know who I would vote for.

On the one hand, I certainly wouldn't support anyone who is pro-life or anti-civil rights.

On the other, I'd want someone I could trust with money.

Any suggestions?
 
 
If he wins the GOP nomination, Ron Paul. If not, Obama. They are the only two decent candidates in the race.

Aren't you pro-Zionist? Trust me, Ron Paul is definitely no Zionist supporter. He's what you would call an "anti-Semite" because of his views he doesn't share in public for political reasons.

Right now Obama seems best, and even thats not great. Better the devil you know.

 

It really sucks to﻿ go back and see how many highly educated people were duped by Obama. At least with the Bush Administration, you knew what to expect from a Snake in The Grass.

Oh yeah, he's not running this time...

Exactly, Ron Paul is ridiculously extreme.

The American Founding Fathers were not omniscient gods who created the absolutely perfect Constitution for all of eternity. John Adams himself said that he worried that his generation was not up to the task of founding a nation.

In the same way in which he follows a Literalist interpretation of the Bible - which is bad theology, Ron Paul follows a Literalist interpretation of the Constitution - which is bad political philosophy.

I am a conservative who believes in small-government, but the state has a role and a purpose to play in society, and while we must prevent it from growing too big, it is insane to try and dismantle it to the extent that Ron Paul wants to.

What would happen if Ron Paul enacted his isolationist views as President? I wouldn't be suprised if by the end of his first term:
- There was a major war on the Korean Peninsular after US troops abandoned South Korea.
- Taiwan was annexed into Communist China.
- Pakistan collapsed and the Taliban acquired its nuclear arsenal.
- Russia annexed Georgia and the Ukraine.
- A Muslim-Brotherhood controlled Egypt teamed up with Syria and Iran to finally destroy Israel and enact a second Holocaust.

Anyone is better than Ron Paul.
 
 
Anyone but Bachmann!
 
 
 
Oh **** off. I'm not going to talk about your nonsensical and antisemitic conspiracy theories.

 

Everyone knows that Jews are the most organised ethnic group in American media. That fact is a few clicks on your keyboard and mouse away. If Ron Paul exposed this fact, you would be all over him calling him an anti-Semite. And so would all the other sheep, hence why he doesn't mention it for political reasons. Therefore, in effect, you are supporting someone you'd refer to as anti-Semitic. Ha.

Who gave you a crazy idea like that, the brotherhood teaming up with Syria/Iran, do you know how ridiculous this sounds? That's not going to happen in a billion years.

You say that you are a "conservative who believes in small-government" then you say that anyone is better than Ron Paul. Contradiction. Is there really any presidential candidate who is quite like Ron Paul to the extent that they support freedom and democracy? How far do you want the government to interfere with our lives?

The Constitution is beautifully written. You are correct that it is not perfect, but it still ensures the freedom to own weapons, the freedom of thought, the freedom of speech, etc. Many of the bought politicians are anti-freedom and anti-Constitution. Human beings aren't stupid. We aren't robots with no conscience. I know it may seem that way sometimes, but we can and do have the right for government to interfere with our lives as less as possible. And Ron Paul exemplifies that message. He has a clean record and is America's last hope and the corporate media hates that.

The Constitution is beautifully written, you are right. It is a really good example of negative liberty, best evidenced by the Founding Fathers manipulation of Locke's words from "Life, liberty, and property" to "Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness". Sometimes to provide that pursuit of happiness to all Americans, by providing good education and employment, it needs to increase its spending and engage in redistribution.

Negative liberty is not always coincident with a smaller government.
 
 
 
No. I'm not going to argue with somebody like you any more. You've proven yourself to be of milder intellect than anybody else on TSR, so I can't be arsed to talk to you any more.

 

OK, whatever you do, support Ron Paul and spread the message. Freedom for America and no more wars for Israel

At the minute none of the GOP candidates look strong enough to challenge Obama, so it looks like he going to be re-elected..
 
 
 
What's the issue with his foreign policy, it's the best from the GOP and Democrats combined.

 

I feel that he is too isolationist. His emphasises diplomacy, but diplomacy only works when you complement it with exercising hard and soft power on the world stage.

I think the US is much better off replacing its emphasis on military power with economic and soft power (funding development and agencies which promote development etc.). And it should put more focus on doing things through international institutions rather than unilateral action and winning hearts and minds in the Middle East.

Listening to Ron Paul he's a bit too much "lets get our noses out of other countries and focus on our problems at home." But America has a very special opportunity to help shape the world (not in its own image though) and make sure that pressure is put on removing oppressive dictators and promoting good long-term democratic and economic development which benefits local populations.

Its important that the West champions these ideas to combat the Chinese doctrine of leaving dictators alone while providing plenty of economic intervention which, in the long term, will transfer wealth from natural resources to Chinese companies and elites while completely ignoring the local population.

Have you gone back and watched the debate Romney was in with Ted Kennedy? It's like watching a completely different person. I don't think he will win the nomination because shades of the old Romney keep coming through. He still won't apologize for Romneycare and he is using left wing talking points to attack other republicans on social security.

Being an isolationist and a non interventionist are very different. Ron Paul advocates free trade. That is about as far away from isolationism as you can get.

America has tried to shape the world. And it has made the world much worse. And if it does shape the world, it will inevtiably do it in their own image.

 
We need to mind our own business. That's what we need to do
 

Ron Paul

Never confuse good intentions without positive implications. Attempts to make the world better through force and corruption have always failed and always will. Man has only improved his conditions through voluntary consent.

The irony of course is, Paul cares about US interests and not other people's concerns. The average Joe on the street couldn't care less who is in power in another country so long as they don't threaten US interests. It's actually in US interests to have oppressive dictators in the Middle East and elsewhere, in fact that was the US strategic policy for over 30 years.

Paul is the only one who understand that so long as the US continues to tries to police the world, it will exhaust itself and spend itself into insignificance. It's nobody's business whether a country has democracy or not, why should the average American care whether Mrs Mbutu gets a vote in Zimbabwe?

The major foreign policy factor that Paul got right though, is that foreign terrorists do not target the US because they have primaries in Iowa and Florida, or because they have McDonald's and Coca Cola, the reason why the US makes enemies abroad is because of their interventionism. It's in their own national interest to stop putting their nose in places where they have no business, and no one can deny that it's a national security threat to do so.

The GOP candidates are all as mad as March Hares and will rapidly accelerate the country's plummet towards third-world status. But there's also the dreadful prospect of another 4 years with the most useless president in history at the helm.

Sorry, yeah non interventionist is a much better term. Ron Paul's free trade stance is the one thing which I really really like. But still non-interventionism is not the way to go. I'm strongly opposed to any American support of (past, present or future) of dictators for security because as time has shown, the ends do not justify the means because security is not achieved and it has always come back to bite America.

America doesn't have to "shape the world in its own image" and it shouldn't. What it should it is to promote political and economic development properly, by encouraging good governance, helping to build political institutions, encouraging those in their own country who want democracy. The US should never be the driving force in promoting such development, but it should always help those who are pushing for such reforms by providing much greater amounts of soft power.

Ron Paul would not have any of this though. He did not support intervention in Libya, even though It's pretty clear that there was "voluntary consent" for improved conditions by the rebels.

I've found J.S. Mill "A few words on non-interventionism" has the best argument. Non-interventionism would be great if everyone practised it. But because countries like China will intervene in countries and promote solely their own interests, America has a duty to intervene to protect the interests of the local population.

The only problem is that America has shown that when it acts a lone, its impossible for it to act in the interests of the local population and not in its own interests. So more emphasis needs to be put on multilateral institutions where the West can coordinate a much more effective interventionist foreign policy.

Yeah admittedly he's not polling great at the minute, but the point I'm trying to make it that even when he's not polling well he appeals more than any of the GOP candidates as none of them look strong enough to mount a serious bid. Who is your favourite to get the nom?
 
 
 
Couldn't agree more. But still...Ron Paul's definitely not the answer :P.

 

How so?
 
 
I don't even care who gets elected, I'm not American and American politics or even America in general is a topic I despise discussing about.
 
 
 
The GOP candidates are all as mad as March Hares and will rapidly accelerate the country's plummet towards third-world status. But there's also the dreadful prospect of another 4 years with the most useless president in history at the helm.

 

Ron Paul isn't mad. The others are though.
 
 
I'm pretty sure Obama will win and considering that the Dems aren't going to have anyone run against him and how pathetic the Rep candidates are at the moment, I hope that he does win.
 
 
Pretty sure for the most part BHO will be a one-term president....... a useless scumbag that has done nothing good for the country and only made the economic crisis worse. It is very unlikely anyone in the democrat party would challenge the incumbent.

My choices for the next Republican President :-
1) Mitt Romney, he really should have run instead of John McCain in 2008, but maybe the Republicans were quite smart to place an unpopular fellow who wouldn't win so the Democrats would bear the brunt of the economic downfall.

2) Michele Bachmann - "Individualism and personal responsibility have always been the bedrock of the country" for this alone I think she should be elected, in any case she is the closest thing America is ever going to get to a Margaret Thatcher which is what is needed right now.
 
 
Herman Cain, but only out of morbid curiosity.
 
 
 
No, that's not what I meant. I support Ron Paul because he's a lot more liberal than the other GOP candidates, and Obama's a lazy president.

 

But I'm saying that Ron Paul is basically anti-Israel. That is why the media are blacking him out or trying to defame him. If you a blind supporter of Israel then you wouldn't support Ron Paul. You clearly don't understand that, do you?

Yeah admittedly he's not polling great at the minute, but the point I'm trying to make it that even when he's not polling well he appeals more than any of the GOP candidates as none of them look strong enough to mount a serious bid. Who is your favourite to get the nom?

 

No favorite for me yet, but I do find the one that the media keeps saying is the "frontrunner", Mitt Romney, to be unacceptable.
This ad from Perry does a good job explaining why  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfcOGWRfXdk 

We already tried running one of these moderate republicans once before in 2008 and it was a disaster. I'm not interested in repeating history.
 
 
 
2) Michele Bachmann - "Individualism and personal responsibility have always been the bedrock of the country" for this alone I think she should be elected, in any case she is the closest thing America is ever going to get to a Margaret Thatcher which is what is needed right now.

 

A nice line, but its just a statement about what are the fundamental ideas of America. It says nothing about her beliefs and policies.

If you want a bit of Bachmann talking about herself check some of these out...

Ron Paul isn't mad. The others are though.

 

John Huntsman is the best of the GOP's runners - seems a pragmatic, intelligent, and decent man - but he doesn't stand a chance - far too liberal for the GOP's current taste for lunatic right wing politics.

You want someone who doesn't know the difference between the constitution and the declaration of independence to be the US president?

I don't even want to delve into her views on homosexuality. Those speak for themselves.

Bachmann won't win. I would be very surprised if she does. If she does, it will be a horrible day for the US.

He's sensible (probably the most out of all the Republicans), but he's too weak.

He's not as wimpy as Pawlenty, but he's still wimpy.

Is tonight's debate on Bloomberg in the UK? The Fox Debates were on in the UK not sure if we have the same Bloomberg channel or not.

Nothing on Sky Guide but then again neither was the fox debate
 
 
 
Michael Bloomberg but alas he is not running  

 

Agreed.

That's the first time I ever heard someone call Herman Cain an idiot. Cain worked on developing fire control systems for ships and fighter planes for the Department of the Navy. That makes him, literally, a rocket scientist.

 

Maybe not an idiot, but saying its jobless people`s fault they dont have a job doesnt strike well.

If unemployment was still at 4-5 percent I would agree with him

Instead of blaming the unemployed for being lazy he should blame the presidents horrific economic policies which have completely ruined the US economy. Obama's been like a wrecking ball

I agree, but I don`t think the president is soley to blame. During the financial many jobs have gone wich simply will never come back. And, not to mention, people being made redundant and / or jobs being outsourced.
 
 
 
No one other than Paul or Obama. Any of the other GOP candidates would make things a whole whole lot worse (oh the terror of Michelle Bachmann as president).

At least Paul would do the right thing regarding foreign policies. He doesn't make sense to me in terms of economy, but hey, I'd rather have a president who does something right.

On the other side, Obama doesn't really do anything. He's a lousy president.

So, yeah, not much going on there. IMO, Obama will probably win it. But it won't make that much of a difference. He's not going to do anything.

Obama has done a lot for the US so far.

I can't pretend i've looked in to the other candidates as yet, but I was a huge fan of Obama's campaign in 2008, and I think he deserves a second term. However, I don't get a vote, so it doesn't really matter.

Just went on that site and every line that came up involved spending a hundred million here or a few hundred billion there, hardly built my enthusiasm

He's achieved a lot with that money though. I agree Obama still needs to combat the debt, but he's not helped when congress rejects his plans or very nearly causes a catastrophic debt crisis because they can't agree on a compromise...

I guess the fact that I don't have a favorite kind of proves your point. None of them inspire me, but I still believe any other them could easily beat Obama because the economy is so terrible

Considering the legacy left by Bush, I think McCain did rather well, don't you think?

Every post-war republican who's won the presidency has won because they've won over the centre ground. Of the current GOP candidates, only Romney is likely to do that. For all your criticism of Obama, his poll numbers are low because of dissatisfaction from the right and the left. Any GOP candidate will have to win over centralists that are currently supporting Obama.
 
 
Interesting note: There is currently another thread running (Why do people hate the U.S) Several people have posted comments along the lines of stating how pleased they are with America's economic decline. All of the people on this thread who posted that sentiment on the other, have stated that they support Obama (one didn't indicate who he supported).
 
 
Rick Santorum. I just hope among the republicans they don't pick that little fascist, Perry.
 
 
Ron Paul will be dead by 2012.

No I don't think McCain did well at all. He was running against an inexperienced community organizer with no experience who was connected to terrorists and other dangerous radicals. McCain was so uninspiring and so loathed by his base they couldn't be bothered to vote. It was the first presidential election I stayed home for because I couldn't see a point in voting.

That was the reason why McCain lost. On issues like taxes and global warming and drilling and dozens of other issues there was no difference in policy between the two men. Even foreign policy is turning out to be more or less damn near identical. Voters need a clear choice instead of a real democrat versus a phony republican. When voters are given that choice the real democrat always wins.

Looks like the GOP are too incompetent to nominate someone who could win against Obama, in 2008 and 2012.

You must be kidding, I don't think any of them could beat Obama at the minute, the front runner Mitt Romney doesn't have a chance, Obama's healthcare reform was based on Romney's Massachusetts healthcare reform, so he can hardly be critical there. Plus he's a mormon so there's the New Christian Right gone, no chance mate.
 
 
Obama won't be beaten. He's starting to give his 'change' speeches after being the Republicans' bitch for a couple of years. I guess many people won't see past the talk and, so they'll continue to vote for him. It's only in his second term when people realise how much of a lousy president he is. Don't expect him to keep any of his promises in his campaign speeches.

Not that there's much else to choose from. Obama is slightly better than the rest of the GOP tossers, so he's naturally the best choice IMO.

It's historically unprecedented for a president with obama's job approval and economic numbers to go on to be reelected. I don't see it happening because nothing like that has ever happened in American history or probably even world history.

Also the polls show that a majority of americans think Obama will be a one term president.

I'm not saying it's completely implausible for Obama to get reelected, just that it is extremely unlikely

Yes but I think in those points in history there was an alternative candidate who had strong public support and was charismatic enough to beat the incumbent, however this time around there doesn't seem to be an appealing alternative.

Just wondering, do you vote Republican, and are you from the US?

Obama is so hated that many people will vote for a steaming pile of fecal matter over him, it doesn't matter who the opposition is.

I am from the US. In this country people vote for the candidate, not the party like in Europe, and their have been times I have not voted republican. For example, when Joe Lieberman ran as an independent I voted for him over the republican choice because the democrat had no experience and the republican had no chance of winning.

What's sad for democrats is that they could have had this in the bag if they had played their cards differently. If the stimulus had something in it to help businesses succeed enough to hire people and they hadn't forced a healthcare bill that no one wanted on us, Obama would be on his way to victory in 2012

Well if the Republicans in congress actually backed the stimulus, which would have helped, instead of shooting it down because it was from Obama, and moved away from their ridiculous party politics mentality and towards actually helping people who are in need, the US would be looking a whole let better right now.

Also, at least Obama tried to implement some type of healthcare reform that promised to help the people who needed it, only for the Republicans to oppose it because they thought it was bloody socialism, they should realise that governments should try to help people in need!

You don't seem to have any clue what you are talking about. For the first two years of Obozo's presidency there were hardly any republicans in congress. What republican opposition are you talking about? Obozo had overwhelming majorities, and got everything he wanted. The problem is that Obama never worked a normal job in his life, never ran or managed anything and has no executive experience, so he has no clue how jobs are created. Why would he?

As for the healthcare no one wanted, again, there were not enough republicans to stop Obama from doing whatever he wanted. Obamacare was rammed through using overwhelming democrat majorities. It's a piece of crap because it's a bad piece of legislation, not because of republicans.
 
 
I don't think you have a clue what you're talking about. Obama's economic stimulus was torn apart by senate Republicans, they cut forced a cut of $150 billion from the original plan, economists and nobel prize winners were in favour of the original plan, but then noted that the new plan, post senate, was too small.

Obama, has no executive experience? No clue how jobs are created? He doesn't sit in a small dark room and come up with legislation on his own you know, he has a massive team of advisors who draft the legislation and I think they know their economics mate.

As for the healthcare bill, sure it passed in the house, after every Republican voted against it. Then twelve Republican state attorneys have subsequently blocked the bill in their states. Great stuff Republicans!

The bookies have them both at 10/11. Obama was at 2/5 after the Bin Laden killing, but now has dropped back to evens.

To suggest that Romney hasn't a chance is talking bollix basically. Now I think still Obama will win, but he's not a cert, and the bookies across the board know this, his job approval numbers are poor (among independants he's in the 30s). So if Romney does get the nomination, he definitely does have a chance. Only a moron or somebody who's been drinking the Obama koolaid thinks otherwise. He's not that great and has been overhyped to death.

I think the problem with the GOP candidates is that they look crap even before the media has begin to seriously dig into their past and find where all the skeletons are.

I really would like a good GOP candidate because it would make Obama up his game and get things done like liven up the economy, sort out the Syrian crap etc. But he know he can coast because whoever the GOP nominates as his opposition would defeat themselves without Obama even trying.

Romney has no chance amongst traditional Southern Republicans who take their religion seriously and his Mormonism is seen as a weird sect if not some sort of Satanic cult.

Perry is the empty vessel that makes the most noise.

God it seems like bookies will take any bets these days!

Ok, Romney has a chance, everyone has a chance, if he gets the nom then great, but his chance is very slim of becoming the next president. The incumbent's (Obama) numbers will always go down during the opposing nomination race, they always do. His approvals will come back up quite a bit before the race.

I don't think Obama's great, but I just don't think any of the GOP candidates look strong enough to dislodge him. Romney definitely not, his healthcare & religious beliefs will stop him from getting the presidency, I'm not saying no chance, but I don't think he has a good chance.
