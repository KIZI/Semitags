 Public Policy Polling: Barbour, Bryant lead in Mississippi 

being the dumbest nation in the state is really paying off

also figures that palin supporters were the largest of the no-interracial marriage group

They probably don't even know the difference between a Nation and a State, huh?
 
 
Why would they even ask a question like that and why are they only reporting the Republican response and not the Democratic or independent one? Sounds like an ulterior motive.

All that aside, if you've ever been to Mississippi this wouldn't surprise you in the least. It's nothing but a bunch of dumb fat rednecks.
 
 
Of course in MS everyone is a Democrat. At least locally. Nationally it is different.
But who really cares? Why did anyone need to know that? And how many respondents were black?

States rights!!!!

The Republican Party is 90% white.

what about the other half ?
 
 
54% begin in favor of it being legal isn't bad at all. You guys are too negative.

Any breakdown on how the stats fall out based on party and race?

That sure describes Haley Barbour.
 
 
who cares what 46% of republicans think? This is an argument against states rights? The SCOTUS has ruled many state laws unconstitutional. Weak.
 
 
18 to 29........................................................... 12%
30 to 45........................................................... 20%
46 to 65........................................................... 36%
Older than 65.................................................. 32%

So was the poll skewed with nearly a 70 % of the respondents being boomers or older than 65 years of age?

This is why David duke is popular in some circles down there.

Why because he caters to senior citizens? Seems if one wanted the correct results the numbers would have included more of the younger set. It seems asking a generation in the South who may have a skewed viewpoint a question like that, seems off somehow.

A black republican in Mississippi? Really? That is your defense of this? This is all you got?

Wow. What a great debater you must be.
 
 
Democrats are race whores looking to be the next plantation owner

Sad really

Democrats keep Black people out of school with a 51% dropout rate

everything Democrat has destroyed the black community and profited Democrats

What is your objection to Barbour?
 
 
Mississippi is the most conservative state in the Union, and,

the fattest.

You can look it up.

47 percent of all statistics are made up on the spot.

That's true 82.3% of the time.

I saw that on the internet. It must be true.
 
 
This really should not come as too much of a surprise to anyone. As a nation, we only approved of interracial marriage in a majority in the early 1990s. Naturally a backass southern state is going to have more of a backass southern mentality, especially from it's older citizens. They're dying off and we will have a more tolerant society eventually.

 
 
 
It doesn't surprise me, they still have segregated proms in that state, of course they don't want interracial marriage.

Don't really know, I watched a documentary on it on HBO, some small towns have them and in alot of cases the parents help them plan the events.

For the white population it is probably the same..

Amazing how little Mississippi has progressed. They would still try to lynch Obama's father if they had the chance

We know that hate is a learned trait. That the prevailing attitude nationwide is otherwise makes the difference. Their little world of racism is shrinking rapidly.

But only less than 3% are scientists!

So, there's that.

I saw that documentary too, it was amazing. I was totally disgusted.

I'm so thankful I wasn't born in the deep south, seems it's almost impossible to NOT be fat and dumb down there.

Depends where you live I guess, I spent time in the bigger cities down south like Birmingham Alabama and Biloxi Mississipi and it wasn't that bad, who I see really struggling with racism are the small towns, they really haven't moved on that much from the 50s and 60s.

"Four out of five dentists surveyed recommend Trident for their patients who chew gum..."
Now, does that mean 80% of Dentists support the use of Trident gum?
If you think so, you are just the kind of moron pollsters pursue.

That's not right. Barbour is pretty articulate and his neck is definitely not red. It's a pasty color of pale.

Just like it figures the Communist party favored Obama over McCain?

Tell me, does the fact that 44% of Democrats oppose gay marriage get your back up as much as this does? Do you always go ape shit over stupid polls that show how much fun people have lying to pollsters?
