Carlos Tevez's adviser says he spent weeks trying to persuade Manchester City to sell the Argentina striker before this season, and that he can prove the player does not want to leave because of money.

Kia Joorabchian says that he is prepared to make public an e-mail exchange with City to show Tevez turned down the offer of a lucrative contract at the English club, which said last week it already pays him more than any other player.

Joorabchian says Tevez wants to quit because the club has not addressed "certain issues that he wanted dealt with."

Joorabchian did not detail those issues but said the team's failure to qualify for the Champions League meant that "the club was not going in the same direction as he imagined."
