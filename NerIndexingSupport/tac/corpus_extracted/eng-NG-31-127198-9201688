McMisanthrope's Top 25 -- November 25, 2007

Where no top team is safe from the Curse of Mianderson ...

1. Hawaii (11-0): After watching them play with such passion on Friday
night, I just can't see them losing this last game to Washington. At
home. With all their marbles at risk. Nope. I just can't see it.
Sorry, Ty; you may have killed Notre Dame's season, but you're not
going to kill the Rainbow Warriors this year, especially if you can't
even beat Wazzoo.

2. Missouri (11-1): The QB was 40-for-49 last night. Nice. They looked
good; they beat a good team. I just don't think they're as good as the
Buckeyes, but for now, they get the nod. Why? They have a loss to a
"better" team. But can they beat Oklahoma this time around? It should
be a fun game to watch. I notice Sagarin has them third, behind WVU
and tOSU, though.

3. Ohio State (11-1): They're loving this, they really are. And I feel
that if they get a crack at the title this year, they won't cough it
up so easily (if at all). That's the beauty of getting a second
chance, like Florida did last year. (Let's just forget the other
examples, like Florida State in 2000 and Nebraska in 2001, though.)

4. West Virginia (10-1): I don't think they're as good as Ohio State,
either, and while they looked very good yesterday and control their
own destiny in the BCS, I still wonder sometimes. Maybe they're
focused now. I figure they're in the BCS title game, since Pitt isn't
going to stop them anytime soon. Congrats to the Mountaineers. Maybe
Slaton and White will leave early if they win the MNC.

5. Kansas (11-1): Well, they came up short, but they acquitted
themselves well enough. Nothing to be ashamed of here. They should
still get a BCS at-large bid. If they don't, this system is
ridiculous. If they end up in the Holiday Bowl like K-State did that
one time (or the Alamo like K-State did that other time), it would be
a shame. They deserve better.

6. Georgia (10-2): They will get a BCS at-large bid, I suspect.
They're done, they have a good SOS, and they're hot. No matter what
happens in the SEC title game, Georgia is playing like the best team
in the SEC right now.

7. USC (9-2): If the Trojans lose to UCLA next weekend, I will eat my
Avaratec PC laptop. Seriously. Piece by piece. With no condiments. I
just can't see them blowing it two years in a row against UCLA.

8. Arizona State (9-2): Let's see, they only lost to Oregon and USC.
Not a bad slate for this crazy 2007. They deserve a BCS at-large slot
if they beat Arizona, which they better or else they really were
frauds. Where will Dennis Erickson go in 2008? Does that mean the four
BCS at-large spots will be taken by Hawaii, Kansas, Georgia and ASU?
Stay tuned for another exciting episode of "As the BCS Implodes".

9. LSU (10-2): Does Michigan still want Les Miles? Well, with the
Mighty (Mouse) SEC humbled again, LSU fans can still play the "We only
lost in OTs!" card. Don't know where it will get them. It will be just
like Les to lose to Fat Phil, too, next weekend. Oh, I really don't
care which team wins the SEC. They all suck.

10. Boston College (10-2): I bet they won't beat Virginia Tech twice.
But for now, they're ahead of the Hokies because they beat them the
first time out.

11. Virginia Tech (10-2): I'd actually put them ahead of LSU, the way
they're playing right now, but that wouldn't be right, would it? This
is also about the whole season, but the Hokies would probably beat the
Tigers right now if the game was in Blacksburg (and/or on a neutral
field).

12. BYU (9-2): They've won eight in a row very quietly. Does anyone
outside of Utah care? I don't.

13. Boise State (10-2): Deep down, you know they're happy for Hawai'i.
They just wish it hadn't come at their expense this week. Not a bad
season to follow up their dream 2006, though. Hawaii looked faster
than the Broncos on Friday night. And I do feel if that game had been
played on the Blue Turf, the result could have been reversed. Oh well
- dem's da breaks.

14. Oklahoma (10-2): Boise goes ahead of them, because, well ... you
know why. I suspect the Sooners will be ready to ruin Missouri's
season. That would be a shame, too. Then again, watching Chase Daniel
toy with Stoops' defense will be fun. If Tech could do it ...

15. Florida (9-3): Their SOS isn't as high as Cal's or UCLA's, but
they have a better record, don't they? Lucky THEY didn't lose their
starting QB. Tebow is an MVP candidate, but as well we all know, the
Hypesman ain't an MVP Award, is it? Someone needs to remind the voters
of that.

16. Illinois (9-3): They don't rate a BCS spot in my mind, since the
Big Ten was sort of weak this year. They did beat a Top 3 team,
though. Cannot knock that; the sky is their limit next year, right?
Which means they'll choke/Zook it away. I suspect they get the Citrus
Bowl, but you never know.

17. Wisconsin (9-3): They're not this good, but neither is any team
below them in my rankings.

18. South Florida (9-3): I suspect they want those 180 minutes of
their playing lives back. But hey, they were merely bit by the Curse
of Two this year. No shame in that. Small steps, man, small steps. I
just hope they can establish a regular level of success from this
experience. And no, I'm not running for Mayor of Tampa.

19. Clemson (9-3): Lame win against a weak South Carolina team.
Another season of mild disappointment? Seriously, who does Clemson
think they are? What year do they think this is? 1981?

20. Virginia (9-3): Blew THAT one, didn't they? Id0ts. It's weird how
a nine-win season can be viewed as a disappointment, but I guess
everyone thinks they have a chance, right?

21. Oregon (9-3): See Florida above. Dennis Dixon is actually the real
MVP. But he's not the Hypesman winner, either.

22. Cincinnati (9-3): They could have been better this year, and the
Big East played some good football in 2007. Coincidence? I think not.
The ACC is the new weak sister of the BCS, especially with Florida
State and Miami down.

23. Texas (9-3): I've been telling you since Week One this team
sucked. Well, I was right. But it's pretty pathetic that they can go
9-3 in a season where they suck. What does that say about college
football? It says class mobility is limited. What does that say about
the Big XII? It says nothing, except it sucks.

24. Tennessee (9-3): Ridiculous. Their losses were embarrassing. Yet
here, they are, with a chance to win the SEC. But in the end, who
cares? The SEC is out of the BCS title game, which means LSU will win
the SEC, of course. Les Miles will see to that.

25. Connecticut (9-3): They finally crashed, and they crashed hard.
Why keep them here over Air Force? BCS affiliation and SOS. Nothing
more.

Also considered firmly: Air Force, Troy

Don't you talk ugly to me, McMisanthrope. I'll send you to the moon with my
magic shirt!

 

Your "sort by W/L record" algorithm is borken.

On the other hand, they were getting besieged by constant reminders in the
form of interviews and interview requests to talk about the murders that
happened back in April.  I've read repeatedly that the players found it more
than a bit hard to concentrate.

Not to mention Brandon Ore being woefully out of shape.  I'm still not clear
on this whole "my friend's grandmother died, so I hung out with him all
summer and didn't exercise" thing.

On Nov 25, 2:48 pm, McMisanthrope <mcmisanthr ... @gmail.com>, It's
basically 'The Tragedy of King Lear,' except with animated penguins:

 

I hate to think that "All the Marbles" are at stake when the team with
with easiest schedule in Div. I-A is playing a 4-8 PAC 10 team.

We thank you for your expertise.

No really, if we hadn't had you around, we might have had to use a
trained monkey or something to tell who would have been this week's
#1, and we're just glad you are using your brain to give us insights
we would otherwise not have had.
