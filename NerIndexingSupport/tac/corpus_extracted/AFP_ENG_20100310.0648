The Los Angeles Clippers dumped Mike Dunleavy on Tuesday, less than a month
after he surrendered his coaching duties to concentrate on serving as the NBA
club's general manager.

Dunleavy had been 215-325 in 6 1/2 seasons guiding the Clippers, reaching the
playoffs only once with a perennial NBA doormat but managing only 42 triumphs
over the past two seasons.

The Clippers announcd that Neil Olshey will replace Dunleavy, saying, "The team
has simply not made sufficient progress during Dunleavy's seven-year tenure.

"The Clippers want to win now. This transition, in conjunction with a full
commitment to dedicate unlimited resources, is designed to accomplish that
objective."

With a 113-87 loss Tuesday at Orlando, the Clippers fell to 25-39, 12th in the
Western Conference.

Kim Hughes, the Clippers' interim coach after Dunleavy's February 4 departure,
told players of Dunleavy's ouster after the defeat.

"At this point, nothing surprises me," guard Baron Davis said.
