 
 
Another stumbling block in Peace Process
 
 
 Israel approves 1,600 settler homes in East Jerusalem 

Thoughts?
 
 
It's been going on for sometime now. Israel recently approved 900 odd settler units as well, which even the US showed 'deep' concern for. Perhaps they're doing it an attempt to lure the PA out of the statehood bid.
 
 
I thought the general consensus was for Jerusalem to be a free city? So things like this should not antagonise things to much?
 
 
It would have been advisable to freaking halt the settlements while the 'negotiations' are taking place.

But the again, Israel is not in it for peace...

It's meant to be a free city, run by the UN. But Israel recognises it as their Capital city. Hence the 'occupied' territory.

Halting settlement building was one of the conditions for the peace talks to continue, but the Netanyahu administration have carried on

I don't think the Palestinians are in a position to impose such a condition. For one thing they appear unable or unwilling to stop terrorism which shouldn't even need to be a condition.

But more importantly, demanding an end to the Settlement building presupposes the outcome of the negotiations. There is no logical reason why settlement building must stop before negotiations can be carried out. Who says that after a negotiated peace the settlements will have to be removed? Isn't that presupposing the outcome of the negotiations? And if so, how can it be reasonably demanded?

One view, which seems entirely reasonable, is that the settlements become part of the future Palestinian state. In that case there was no need to stop building them.

More importantly, there is a significant difference between settlements that are conjured up in people's minds and East Jerusalem. When people think of settlements they think of small towns built close to Arab villages that then require taking land away from Palestinians and the imposition of road blocks and other security measures. However, what are called settlements in East Jerusalem are simply buildings that form part of the homogeneous area of Jerusalem. I've actually been to the area of Jerusalem where these houses have been approved and it's a part of Jerusalem. The city is growing and growing outwards in all directions as cities do.

So, stumbling block? Only for those who deliberately trip themselves up on it. Negotiations can and should continue regardless of them. And if the outcome is to draw the map a certain way then Jewish people on the Palestinian side should be allowed to remain in their homes (assuming they own the land its on) if they wish. There is a real need to understand the difference between a country and an individual.

Israel has every right to build homes in its capital

Hm no, the temple hill etc is only available fro Muslims.

Is that why they negotiated peace with Egypt and Jordan ?

But it's one of the conditions from the Palestinian's that if Israel is serious but negotiations, settlement building should be frozen.

Wikileaks showed the Fatah party made huge concessions, just so they could re enter negotiations. The Netanyahu administration speaks of two state settlement, but when the USA and other countries in the UN claim they will recognise Palestine as a legitimate state, Israel frowns upon it. I have tons of links to news reports of the Netanyahu administration carrying on with settlement building in various occupied territories.

Negotiations work both ways, both parties need to make a compromise if they are serious about reaching a conclusion.

But don't you see that stopping the settlement building presupposes the outcome of negotiations? Who is to say which parts of the West Bank will be in a Palestinian state and which ones in Israel after land swaps? Who is to say that settlements inside the future Palestine will have to be dismantled? These thing are surely part of the negotiations. So demanding them before negotiations even take place seems ridiculous.
 
 
Boo hoo. Jews buy houses, the world is outraged. Haven't we got better things to do with our time than spread Palestinian propaganda about houses being an 'obstacle to peace' (an ironic statement from a group of people who've rejected everything they've been offered since 1947 apart from Oslo).
 
 
Israel needs more housing desperately, can't really blame them tbh.

Not really. Building illegal settlements on illegally-occupied Palestinian land is illegal under international law, and should be the basic precondition for any Palestinian compromise. The West Bank is officially recognised as Palestinian land by over 100 different countries. These settlements were still being built when the PLO was actively at war with Hamas, so terrorism is a feeble excuse for the continuation of this policy. There's no connection between the construction of Israeli homes in East Jerusalem (which the Palestinians intend to take as their future capital; something even the U.S. officially acknowledges) and the rocketing of houses in southern Israel (a high number of these rockets not actually being fired by Hamas).

As it happens, though, it isn't the Palestinians who are asking for preconditions. The Netanyahu precondition for restarting the so-called "settlement freeze" (which wasn't really a settlement freeze to begin with) is that the PA recognise Israel "as a Jewish and democratic state". Obviously, this is a very absurd demand. Even between established nations this would be ridiculous. Imagine if Britain asked its neighbours to recognise it as a "Protestant and democratic constitutional monarchy", or for Russia to ask the Chechens to recognise the country as an "Orthodox Christian semi-presidential republic". Avigdor Lieberman, the Israeli Foreign Minister, wants all Israeli citizens to take an oath of allegiance to the "Jewish and democratic state", even if the citizens are not Jewish. The PLO has recognised the state of Israel for nearly twenty years. Israel is intent on demanding more and more from the Palestinian leadership until there's literally nothing else to ask for. If it wasn't for recognition of the "Jewish" nature of Israel, it would be for something else. It's impossible for anyone to paint Netanyahu's ratbag government (a direct successor of Begin and Shamir, which includes many religious fanatics and bigots) as one that can bring about a lasting peace.

You haven't addressed the issue. The exact borders of the new Palestinian state are to be decided by negotiation. Likewise the status of settlers in the new state are to be decided by negotiation. To demand that settlement building cease as a precondition presupposes the outcome of those negotiations.

As it happens, the preconditions demanded by Netanyahu are not conditions regarding things yet to be negotiated on.

Virtually every single international organisation recognises the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza as occupied territory. That this is the case is not disputed, even by the United States. The only case where "exact borders" should be an issue to decide by negotiation is with 1:1 land swaps.

This isn't a situation where the Palestinians should be subjected to having to make an equal number of concessions as Israel are. Israel is an aggressor in the occupied territories, and thus has no rights under international law. Removal of the settlements from land within the pre-1967 borders should be the bare minimum of Israeli activity before the Palestinians should feel a need to enter negotiations.

If there was any legitimate dispute over the territory then it would be a different story, but there isn't any dispute. The occupied territories are occupied, and those who are subjected to occupation should not be the ones required to make - yet more - concessions to the occupying power. It should always be the other way around.

Do you believe the unilateral call for a "Palestinian" state will do the "Palestinians" any good ?

Firstly, since you recognise that there may be land swaps (as does everyone else) then you must recognise that some of the settlements may well remain inside Israel. In that case demanding that Israel stop building them is to presuppose that there will be no land swaps.

Secondly, if Israel removes all settlements from the 1967-borders, what is there then to negotiate?

Thirdly, I think there is a legitimate dispute which is completely ignored. The West Bank was captured by Israel from Jordan and yet Jordan's claim to it was not recognised by anyone and has since been withdrawn. As such Israel effectively captured land not belonging to any state. From that point of view the dispute over the West Bank is a legitimate one. That is from a historical and legal perspective. From a political perspective things are different.

Finally, what concessions have the Palestinians made at all to Israel? Have they lessened the amount of land they claim? Have they dropped their demand for the right of return? What concessions have they made? None that I see. That is not to say they haven't suffered but suffering is not a concession.

Okay, then. Apply this principle to the settlements, and I'm sure you're also, therefore, in favour of Israel not building on an equal amount of land within its own territory, and that Palestinians should be allowed to? This due to the fact that "some of this Israeli land will ultimately become Palestinian" through land swaps. It's an evasive and meaningless point. Land swaps should be a point of negotiation, but until then, all settlements that are declared illegal under international law should not be expanded. It's an obstacle to peace in every possible way. Only those who focus on absurd fringe points like this one fail to see that.

 
Secondly, if Israel removes all settlements from the 1967-borders, what is there then to negotiate?
 

You're right to point this out. Negotiation only tends to serve Israel's interests, because it allows them to buy more time during their stated attempt to make a Palestinian state unviable - by dividing the West Bank into non-contiguous cantons. 'Greater Israel' is something supported by elements within Netanyahu's government, as well as governments which Netanyahu worked under in the past. The settlements serve Israel's interests in two ways. First, it allows them to continue the colonization of Palestinian land, and, second, it gives them an excuse to prolong this process by using the facade of negotiation. Tell me, what proposal has any Israeli government put forward with the intention of ending its illegal occupation?

 
Thirdly, I think there is a legitimate dispute which is completely ignored. The West Bank was captured by Israel from Jordan and yet Jordan's claim to it was not recognised by anyone and has since been withdrawn.

From a political perspective things are different.
 

I don't follow your argument. You're saying that if a state moves out of a territory (renouncing claims to it), and another occupies it, the second occupier has more rights than the first? There is no dispute. Over 130 countries recognise the State of Palestine within the pre-1967 borders. The population of the region is predominantly Palestinian. The UN mandated in 1948 that the land be split between two peoples. Israel doesn't have any more of an expansionist claim to Palestinian land than any other country does.

 
Finally, what concessions have the Palestinians made at all to Israel? Have they lessened the amount of land they claim? Have they dropped their demand for the right of return? What concessions have they made? None that I see. That is not to say they haven't suffered but suffering is not a concession.
 

A more important question is: what do they have to concede? You're misunderstanding the fundamental point. Aggressors have absolutely no rights. Palestinians (a) have nothing to concede, and (b) shouldn't be required to concede anything to do with their own land. These debates seem to be full of people who tend to see Israel-Palestine as a situation where both sides should be required to make equal concessions. The way I see it, Israel holds all the cards, yet refuses to make concessions on any issue, even if they have no right to be in such a privileged position.

People rightly apply the principle to Hamas that violent infringement of the sovereignty of Israel (through suicide bombing and rocketing) should not be open to debate. In other words, that there should be no compromise on the issue. I take it you wouldn't have it if some Hamas apologist came out and said "Hamas will reduce its rockets if Israel allows X number of refugees in", or "Hamas will take a step back, and target only Ashkelon but not Sderot or Ashdod if Israel does Y" - and rightly so, because such aggression and terrorism is not a legitimate bargaining chip. The correct demand for the rocketing is that it be halted completely. Exactly the same principle should be applied to the settlements. Illegal settlements sitting on occupied territory are not something that should be used as a bargaining chip. They are a violent infringement of Palestinian sovereignty and self-determination, and, as with Hamas terrorism, negotiation should begin where that nemesis ends.
 
 
I don't like multi-quote battles.

You ask what proposals Israel has made to end the occupation. I assume this is a joke question. Israel has twice in the last ten years offered the entire West Bank and East Jerusalem and Gaza for a Palestinian State. Both times the offer was rejected by the Palestinians.

On the question of rights of the occupier you may be right. Perhaps Jordan has as much right to the West Bank as Israel does. But they've renounced their claim to it. So who has the rights to the territory. You rightly point out that most countries recognise the West Bank as being Palestinian but I'm not talking about politics on that point - I'm talking history and legality. It seems odd to me to declare that there is no dispute when clearly Israel is not occupying some other country since no country has legally existed there since the end of the Ottoman Empire. As for the UN partition plan of 1947 - this was never implemented fully. The Arabs rejected it and invaded the area once Israel had declared itself independent (within the borders in the plan). They lost the war and after the armistice Israel had a larger area. That is why no one is suggesting Israel withdraw to 1947 borders. So it again is difficult to see why the 1967 borders are any more or less non-negotiable.

I note that you've gone from claiming that the Palestinians have made concessions to saying they need not make any.

=====

Let's be clear - From a legal and historical viewpoint the West Bank doesn't belong to any country since no country has claimed it. That is why the Palestinians are now trying to claim it in the UN. If it were a country occupied then that would make no sense. From a political point of view it is considered occupied.

The point is this - settlements do not pose a stumbling block to peace in any real sense, only in a political one. Why should peace be prevented because Israeli citizens are building houses on land they own outside Israel?

I don't know which "offers" you're referring to, but, even if what you say is true, I asked what Israeli government has ever put forward a proposal, or initiative, with the intention of ending its illegal occupation. Every series of so-called "peace negotiations" have been mediated by a power which shows overwhelming support for one side. Israel has never shown that it has an intention to withdraw to the internationally recognised border.

 
On the question of rights of the occupier you may be right. Perhaps Jordan has as much right to the West Bank as Israel does. But they've renounced their claim to it.

No. Jordan has no right to occupy Palestinian land. You seem to be making the common fault of stating that this is simply a territorial issue. It's not a territorial issue. If this was a question of a country expanding into empty space, which used to be under the control of the Ottoman Empire, then why would I, or anyone, care? It's a human issue, not a territorial one. The Palestinians are deprived of the fundamental right to self-determination by an occupying power. There is no dispute over whether this should or should not be the case.

 
I note that you've gone from claiming that the Palestinians have made concessions to saying they need not make any.
 

No. Both would be accurate.

 
The point is this - settlements do not pose a stumbling block to peace in any real sense, only in a political one. Why should peace be prevented because Israeli citizens are building houses on land they own outside Israel?
 

When this includes land and resources being stolen from the local inhabitants, with full material support from the Israeli government and military, then it's not exactly "Israeli citizens...building houses on land...outside Israel". It's forceful building, with an intention to drive the local inhabitants out of the land that is internationally-recognised as theirs. If UK citizens started building houses in northern France then of course they have a right to, if it's agreed to by French authorities, and under French jurisdiction. However, it wouldn't be right for the UK to forcefully occupy a portion of northern France, and colonise it with British settlers. While depriving the native inhabitants of their fundamental right to self-determination. Once again, it's a human issue, not a territorial one.
 
 
If you're unaware of the offered peace deals what makes you even remotely qualified to offer an opinion on the subject?

And yes Palestinians have no self-determination at the moment. That is in part because the form of that self-determination is yet to be decided. They have never had their own country before and (almost all) the people living in the West Bank have never been citizens of a country before. The whole point of negotiations to end the occupation is to decide how to form a new country, or if indeed to do so. In theory the West Bank could become part of Israel, or Jordan even for that matter.

Please identify a concession made by the Palestinians?

From your posts it seems that you know little about the actual history or detail of the conflict.

As far as I know, no Israeli government has put forward an initiative with the stated intention of ending their illegal occupation. I know all about the "peace deals" you're talking about, and none of them have come at Israel's behest. Israel pulled out of Taba in 2001. They brought Bush's initiative to an end in 2008 with their invasion of the Gaza Strip. True, they unilaterally withdrew from the Strip in 2005, but this was hardly anything to do with intention to end the occupation. The Gaza settlers were simply "resettled" in illegally-occupied Palestinian land elsewhere. No Israeli government could have shown care towards their own citizens while leaving them to sit on a war zone. It's simply the case that Israel has never been willing to compromise on any issue that may impede their expansionist ambitions unless (a) it conflicts with their security interests, or (b) it comes at the behest of the one country it knows it needs, the United States.

Yet again, more evasiveness. The question of what "form of self-determination" should come about is overshadowed by the question of why that self-determination doesn't exist in the first place. Israel has no right at all to decide the "form of self-determination" for people who they are depriving of it. Again, the question of "citizenship of a country" is irrelevent: we're talking about a human issue. Not a territorial one. Israel or Jordan have no more of a right to control the livelihoods of other people than European imperialists did.

The burden is first on you to detail what "concessions" you think the Palestinians should make. Before you do that, I don't know what you really mean by the word. It could be said that the Palestinians have already conceded their whole livelihoods to Israeli aggression. The Palestinians essentially have nothing to bargain with. I ask: considering Israel holds all the aces, what concessions have Israel made? (And giving back little pieces of land that they shouldn't be sitting on in the first place is not concession).
 
 
There was both Camp David in 2000 and Taba in 2001. Clinton himself blamed Arafat for the failure of the talks.

The Gaza settlers were not resettled in the West Bank. And if you think they wanted to leave you've clearly got no idea!

Israel doesn't claim to have a the right to decide the form of self-determination, that's why there are negotiations. Why haven't they got that self-determination already? Because they have never been citizens of a democratic country. Before WWI they were citizens of the Ottoman Empire. Then under British Mandate rule. Then, when the UN proposed a partition of the Mandate the Arabs rejected it. The Arabs invaded in 1948 and Jordan seized the West Bank and Egypt seized Gaza. Neither country offered the Palestinians citizenship (and they weren't democratic in any case). After the six-day war Israel had control of those areas and has not yet been able to agree a way to provide for self-determination on a wide scale. Nevertheless, the Oslo Accords gave them limited self-determination for the very first time. The PNA took complete internal control over the major urban areas of the West Bank.

How about the Palestinians dropping their demand for the right of return and seeking compensation instead?

I like the way you negate any concessions from Israel in advance. If Israel shouldn't have been in Gaza who would be? Egypt, is the answer. Israel took Gaza from Egypt, not from the Palestinians.

Israel withdrew from Taba, as is officially known. And have you seen the map for Camp David? Assuming it is true that Arafat was responsible for its failure (and it's by no means certain that this is the case), how could any Palestinian leader accept a deal which would've created a monstrosity like this?

Of course Israel feels it has a right to decide the "form of self-determination", considering it claims ownership of the occupied territories (and not just as a temporary measure). You seem to have a highly favourable opinion of these "negotiations". Tell me, how can these "negotiations" be serious when the mediator shows overwhelming support for one side? What have been their benefit up until now?

You also seem to perceive Israel as some sort of generous, and benevolent occupier - you say it "has not yet been able to agree away to provide for self-determination on a wide scale". Rooted in this is the belief that (a) they want to provide self-determination to the Palestinians (and the evidence - the land grab, the forced evictions, the military aggression etc. - shows that they don't ), and (b) that they've been trying to do this, which they haven't. Forty years of occupation is not a sign that they want to end this state of affairs any time soon. Just look at the Camp David map above; this was under a Labor Prime Minister. They withdrew from Taba, and brought negotiations to an end in 2008 with the assault on Gaza. They've never shown an initiative to withdraw settlements from land which they, both legally and morally, shouldn't be on in the first place.

Furthermore, we're not talking about Jordanian and Egyptian policy towards the Palestinians during their occupations. This is a thread about the Israeli occupation, which is still ongoing.

 
How about the Palestinians dropping their demand for the right of return and seeking compensation instead?
 

I don't think they should completely "drop" the demand for right of return. But I agree they should reduce the number to those first-generation refugees affected by the initial displacements (and their families). Then again, Israel doesn't want any negotiation, or even a hint of a concession on this issue, so those who unjustly lost their homes will probably never see it.

 
I like the way you negate any concessions from Israel in advance. If Israel shouldn't have been in Gaza who would be? Egypt, is the answer. Israel took Gaza from Egypt, not from the Palestinians.
 

Occupation of the livelihoods of other people, and depriving them of self-determination, is wrong regardless of who does the occupying. If Egypt was occupying Gaza then the exact same criticisms would be applied (and you'd probably be more inclined to accept them, considering Arab states are the "bad guys" in your world). As it happens, though, they're not. The "good guys" are occupying them, aren't they?
 
 
There are too many points here, let's deal with one at a time. First, will you agree that the following statement of yours is untrue:

"They've never shown an initiative to withdraw settlements from land which they, both legally and morally, shouldn't be on in the first place."

It's not untrue, because it's never been their initiative. They've either been (a) when the settlers were under threat (as in Gaza), or (b) by U.S.-mediated "negotiations". There has never been an exclusively Israeli initiative to withdraw settlements, with the intention of bringing an end to the occupation. No.

So the settlers of Gaza wanted desperately to leave?

From any rational perspective, it would be crazy for any government to keep 8,000 settlers sitting in an area of a million Palestinians. Not under an immediate threat per se, but any government with concern for the wellbeing of its citizens would never leave them in such a potentially explosive situation. It doesn't really matter what the settlers think - of course they wouldn't have wanted to leave their homes. But, in terms of expansion, Gaza isn't particularly important to Israel. The West Bank is, and the disengagement plan simply saw further developments made in the other parts of occupied Palestine.

I will just add that there's also the Geneva Accords, and Arab Peace Initiative, sitting on the table which Israel hasn't touched. The former even rejects the right of return, and Israel haven't seen fit to make use of it. Why would they when they hold all the aces? They need to adhere to U.S./Quartet negotiation processes, because they're reliant on these powers to survive. Anything else - i.e. any independent initiative - is simply ignored.

You're speaking, frankly, nonsense. The removal of settlers from Gaza almost turned into a civil war in Israel. The settlers really didn't want to leave and they had strong support from the right. Israel forced them out purely because of some vague notion that they were under threat? Even though they didn't care about that threat?

And since then thousands of rockets have been fired from Gaza into Israel. The threat is bigger now than it was then. Israel haven't gone back in permanently, have they?

Moreover, at the same time as the removal of all settlers from Gaza, hundreds were removed from the West Bank.

Here was an Israeli initiative to end the occupation unilaterally and in stages. The response from the Palestinians to the withdrawal from Gaza made it politically impossible to continue the same policy. The Kadima party was established precisely to continue this policy and became the largest party in the Knesset in the elections after the disengagment. It soon lost a lot of support when the Palestinian response to withdrawal became clear.

I think that the reality is that you are unable to see the things you declare don't happen because you do not want to see them.

What do you mean, "they didn't care about that threat?" Of course Israel cares about the wellbeing of Israeli citizens, and potential dangers to them. It's utterly illogical to have 8,000 of your own citizens living in an area surrounded by over a million enemies.

This operation was not executed with the intention of ending the occupation. Settlers were withdrawn from certain areas of the West Bank, that is true. But what about the thousands of homes that have been built in the West Bank and East Jerusalem since 2005? Don't forget that the leader and proponent of this "disengagement" plan was Ariel Sharon - a war criminal and mass murderer. Sharon said that he always wished the Gaza settlements to have been kept; it was only due to practicality that they had to be removed. To try and make out that this action was taken due to a deep concern for the national interests of the Palestinians is utterly misguided. It was a deceptive piece of realpolitik.

 
And since then thousands of rockets have been fired from Gaza into Israel. The threat is bigger now than it was then. Israel haven't gone back in permanently, have they?
 

The rockets are not a direct consequence of the disengagement. The increase in rockets is due to the type of government the Palestinians have elected in Gaza. Of course, we can never know what a Hamas government pre-2005 would've looked like, but I expect it would've seen far more attacks on the Gaza settlements than there actually were.
 
 
So you're saying that Ariel Sharon both wanted to have the settlements remain in Gaza and that it was utterly illogical for them to be there? That the disengagement plan was evil because Sharon was evil? That the disengagement plan had nothing to do with the peace process? That the election of Hamas to the PLC had nothing to do with the disengagement? That the Hamas violent takeover of Gaza had nothing to do with the disengagement? That the firing of thousands of rockets had nothing to do with the disengagement?

These are all nonsense claims. They are the kind of claims one expects from someone who is blinded by hatred of Israel mixed with a good dose of ignorance and irrationality. I can't see any benefit in continuing discussing this with you given the complete drivel you continue to come out with.

I never said the "disengagement plan was evil" (although, in a sense, this one was; because it was essentially a cover for further expansion elsewhere). But to say that this was motivated by concern for the interests of Palestinians is incredibly misguided. Why would it be motivated by that, when the operation was carried out by a man who's spent his entire life trying to deprive the Palestinians of their basic civil and human rights?

The election of Hamas was not a direct consequence of the disengagement, no. The 'root cause' of Hamas ideology has nothing to do with the intricacies of Israeli policy. Hamas rockets are motivated by the dynamic of the movement itself, and no Israeli policy will alter that. Not disengaging may well have tamed the Hamas threat somewhat, but it would not have eradicated it.

 
blinded by hatred of Israel
 

On the contrary, I love Israel, and have spent a fair amount of time there, have many Israeli friends etc. Being against the settlements is a pro-Israel standpoint, because expansionist policy, and the aggrevation of tensions, is something that puts Israeli citizens' lives in danger. Expansionism is also anti-Zionist, because it means that Jewish lives are threatened (who is safer? A Jew living in LA, or a Jew living in a settlement on occupied Palestinian land?) Israeli citizens are being put through this vile experiment by bigoted and religious elements within their country's hierarchy, who want to see their Palestinian brothers and sisters subjected to occupation and eviction. It's absurd to claim that being opposed to Israeli government policy is motivated by a "hatred of Israel".

Congrats. The BBC used to use that excuse too.

You're yet to explain why it was beneficial to Israel to withdraw settlers from Gaza? Or why it was supported in general by centrists and leftists and opposed by the settler movement and the right? This last fact is especially difficult for your position if, as you claim, the plan was really just cover for expansion.

BBC? What?

Withdrawal of all illegal settlers from the Occupied Territories would be beneficial for Israel. Recent years have seen a relatively peaceful state of affairs in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, but this is not going to last forever. Discontent with occupation can only be bottled up for so long, and uprisings are a direct consequence of it. (That's not to say that I support, or am trying to rationalise, the terrorist activity that came with the last intifada; but the settlements are still a major contributor to hostility). However, you seem to be addressing my points as though unilateral withdrawal is the only thing I favour. On the contrary, I am in favour of negotiations; but I don't begrudge the PA for not entering into them until at the very least a moratorium has been implemented. The current means of negotiation are what are at fault (the vulgarities of the 'Fateful Triangle'); not the concept of negotiation itself.

The right was not entirely opposed to this policy. Would you call Sharon and Likud, the instigators of this policy, a "centrist" or a "leftist" movement? Gaza is not essential to any of the Israeli right's expansionist intentions; the fact that some of the right-wing see things differently is beside the point.

Clearly Israel and Israelis disagree with you.

One of the reasons would probably be the aftermath of what happened in Gaza. Another would be the reality that hundreds of thousands of Israelis live in settlements, many of which are very close to Israel itself.

Another would be the history. If Israel leaves East Jerusalem, for example, there is no guarantee that Jews would every be allowed to the Western Wall. Jordan prevented them doing so and the Palestinians have not got a good track record of protecting Jewish religious sites under their control.

There's another important point here. The PNA is not a properly functioning democracy. Hamas certainly is not democratic by nature. There is no certainty and only very little likelihood that an independent Palestine would be democratic and afford self determination to the people who live there. Very few neighbouring countries afford such a right to their citizens.

Moreover, there's no certainty at all that a state of Palestine would live in peace with Israel and be able or willing to prevent terrorist attacks being launched from within its borders. Lebanon, for example, is unable or unwilling to prevent such attacks.

So is it obvious to you that the potential achievement of self-determination for the Palestinians outweighs the clear and present security concerns of Israelis?

All of the points you listed are things that should be sorted by negotiation (including the questions of terrorism, democracy, militarization, access to religious sites, and so on). My objection is that the settlements should not be used as a bargaining chip in the negotiations, and should be removed prior to them. Of course, I accept that this is extremely unlikely, and thus I'd see it as fairly reasonable if Israel retained control of the major settlement blocs, before swaps can be agreed. But Israel aren't even thinking about addressing the settlement issue, as demonstrated by their refusal to freeze settlement building. It's a pure contradiction to believe that Israel want to dismantle the settlements after negotiation, while at the same time they approve the building of thousands of new homes (in an area which the Palestinians intend to take as their future capital). Indeed, it may well be understandable that portions of the Israeli public (and most are opposed to the settlements fyi) are concerned about consequent violence, but this is only half of the issue. What about the routine violence the Palestinians are subjected to? Or is the life of an Israeli child more valuable than the life of a Palestinian child in your view?

Plus, you failed to address the question of the Camp David map, as well as the reasons beind Israel's refusal to even touch the Geneva Initiative (which rejects the right of return). Why did they withdraw from Taba? Why did they reject the Clinton Parameters? Sure, you can partly apply these principles to the PA, but we're not talking about the PA in this thread; we're talking about Israel's obstacles to peace.

As I see it the West Bank is a an area of land without a country. It should be treated like the British Mandate pre-1948 or like the Indian subcontinent pre-1948. In both of those cases there were two people living in the area who did not want to live together and the result was partition. The same should be true of the West Bank.

It makes no sense to force all Jewish people who live in the West Bank to become part of an Arab state that they don't want t become part of. Sure, if they live far away from a feasible border that's different, but most don't.

Now, you could argue that they shouldn't be there so it is different. In order to do that, though, you have to explain why it is wrong for someone who happens to be Jewish (not all are Israeli) to buy a plot of land in a stateless territory and build a house on it.
 
 
 
It would have been advisable to freaking halt the settlements while the 'negotiations' are taking place.

But the again, Israel is not in it for peace...

 

Yeah, let's never mind the fact that Palestinians were afforded a 9 month settlement freeze in the past, but they waited until the very last moment to do anything about it and as such, nothing came of it and Israel was blamed.

Over the last 30 days, some 20-40 missiles/mortars have been fired at Israel but no, these actions can't possibly be considered a threat to peace, where as building some houses invokes the fury of all of you "peace loving" idiots.

Besides, why should Israel not build in East Jerusalem? It has never served as a capital of "Palestine" nor has a "Palestine" ever held sovereignty over it, Ramallah or Gaza City could easily serve as their capital - "Palestine" has absolutely no claim to Jerusalem. People say that EJ is occupied, occupied from who? Israel "occupied" it after Jordan did so from 1948-1967 but then, who did Jordan occupy it from in the first place? As is the case with the West Bank, it's a disputed territory, not an occupied territory.

It's also sad how Israel is singled out in this regard. If only Chinese settlements in Tibet, or Moroccan building in the West Sahara received this much attention, or were considered a "threat to peace", pathetic.

Personally, I do believe Israel should halt West Bank construction indefinitely, and should be prepared to dismantle settlements that aren't a part of land swaps, however, I don't blame them for hesitating because the whole "land for peace" garbage is exactly that, garbage because Israel withdrawing from a territory is usually met with an attack - they see it as a concession and a signal that their tactics are working, not an act of peace.

Am I misreading this or are you saying Israel rejected the Clinton Parameters and withdrew from Taba? If I have, then just ignore this.

I'm fairly sure it was Arafat who rejected the Clinton Parameters, where as Israel voted to accept them [despite some opposition] whilst sending reservations - reservations that Clinton said were within the perimeters. Arafat on the other hand, came up with reservations that were unacceptable and after the deadline had passed. Indeed, on the opening of the Taba talks, Ahmed Qurei said "we refused to accept the Clinton initiative as a basis for the negotiations. The Israelis said that the Clinton proposals should be the basis, but we rejected it.", Abbas also made similar defiant remarks.

Let's be honest, the violence was raging on and there had been a change in Israeli politics and this was on the eve of more failed talks, contrary to the end statement of Taba, they were never going to agree upon a deal because the Palestinians only hardened their positions and withdrew previous concessions and if anything, Arafat saw Israeli concessions as proof that the tactic of violence was 'working', he also made a bizarre attack on Israel a day after (?) the talks at a conference. One of the lead negotiators for Palestine said after the talks that it there has never before been a clearer gap in the positions of the two sides."

Don't get me wrong, I'm aware that Israel has played a part in the break down of several deals, however they don't even begin to compare to the own-goals that Palestinians have made regarding negotiations, own-goals that otherwise would have brought about a solution and that's unfortunate because we're now left in this terrible position.

You will see that I said the principle can also be applied to the PA. The 'reservations' of either side effectively amounted to de facto rejection. The Parameters were intended to be non-negotiable.

The moratorium should be permanent if Israel wants to demonstrate that it's serious about peace. I would even go so far as to say it should unilaterally withdraw a significant number of settlers (specifically those not living in the major settlement blocs on the Western side of the wall, as well as those which jeopardise Palestine's contiguity) and dismantle the highways that allow access to these. Instead, Israel are doing the exact opposite. As it happens, though, the previous "settlement freeze" was not really a genuine one at all.

Israel hasn't been faithful to the Oslo Accords. The Gaza blockade (and other restrictions on freedom of movement) is a violation of them in every possible way.
 
 
 
As I see it the West Bank is a an area of land without a country. It should be treated like the British Mandate pre-1948 or like the Indian subcontinent pre-1948. In both of those cases there were two people living in the area who did not want to live together and the result was partition. The same should be true of the West Bank.

 

Tbh, holding up partition and imperialist throwbacks as a good model for solving this is something I'm really unable to consider with any sincerity. The West Bank is not an analogous case. In the case of the West Bank, the Israeli authorities are the equivalents of viceroys, and the settlers are the equivalent of, well, imperialist settlers (such as the Afrikaans). In the case of India, the Hindu and Muslim populations were both subjected to imperialist rule prior to partition - and partition was an absolute disaster.

 
It makes no sense to force all Jewish people who live in the West Bank to become part of an Arab state that they don't want t become part of. Sure, if they live far away from a feasible border that's different, but most don't.

Now, you could argue that they shouldn't be there so it is different. In order to do that, though, you have to explain why it is wrong for someone who happens to be Jewish (not all are Israeli) to buy a plot of land in a stateless territory and build a house on it.
 

I repeat, aggressors are not entitled to such rights. I also repeat, I don't care about the land, I care about the human issue - the international consensus (rejected by Israel and the U.S.) is for two states as a just solution to the question of Palestinian self-determination. The settlements are clearly a barrier to this, because while they ensure a pretty decent life for the Jewish inhabitants, the Palestinians living under occupation are simply expected to deal with it, and are left to rot in the long term. Your view of things would never bring about a just solution to the issue, it would simply see Israel grow and grow, while the Palestinians are either left to live in the area as a stateless minority, or be forced to leave. The West Bank is already subdivided by Israeli corridors, which restrict Palestinian freedom of movement: when these infrastructure projects are being expanded, it's not particularly difficult to interpret what Israel's intentions are. Their actions have effectively guaranteed permanent war for the next 40-50 years (unless the U.S. changes its policy, which probably won't happen any time soon).

This simply isn't true. How can it be the case that Israel and their U.S. benefactors are in favour of a two-state solution when, in material terms (not flowery rhetoric or insincere "negotiation" processes), their actions are making this an impossibility? Sure, I'm perfectly aware of the Palestinian faults; but it's not doubted that the PLO now recognises the State of Israel. The problem is that Israel demands more than simply recognition - it demands recognition as a "Jewish state", and it demands a "right to exist". No other state on earth calls for such things. When was the last time you heard a British Prime Minister ask other countries or national authorities to recognise Britain as a "Protestant" or COE state (as if everyone living in the country was a member of that creed)? What is that to say about the 20%+ Israeli citizens who are Arab, Muslim, Christian or whatever else?

A wall doesn't need to encroach over 15 miles into Palestinian land, and cut off freedom of movement between Palestinian villages, in order to stop terrorists. Likewise, a blockade on essential goods and provisions has nothing to do with terrorism in the same way that, say, an arms embargo would. Israel controls all entry into the Strip either way, so it would be perfectly easy to monitor the potential inflow of weapons without choking off the inflow of food, medicines etc. Instead, tunnels are dug out between Egypt and the Gaza Strip, which ensure the inflow of weapons anyway. The siege only succeeds in making the normal Palestinian suffer, while doing little else.

That should have been enough for talks. Get this straight. "talks" - that's all it is, what's all the fuss? Just open dialogue for goodness sake.
Worst case scenario, the other side was not serious and you wasted hours of your time talking - big deal. The possible gain of peace from simply talking and negotiating far outweigh the risk of being the "butt of a joke" by the side which is "not commited" (as some believe). I can't stress this enough.

So fine, Israel conceded to the demand by freezing the settlement building for 10 months - which it didn't need to for the reasons I stated.
Why didn't the Palestinians realise "O, this is the best it's gonna get before right-wingers take more firm control and refuse to play our little game, so we'd better start talking again for the sake of peace". But no, evidently, it's the Palestinians who weren't serious about talks (and still aren't).

Well what do you expect when terrorists are in control of an entire strip of land???
 
 
 
Oh, its not true. Im guessing thats why the "Palestinians" left the negotiation table then.

 

The Palestinians left negotiations because Israel ended the "settlement freeze" (which, as I've said, was already something that permitted the construction of settlements in certain areas). Settlements are a means of Israeli expansion, which are destined to destroy the viability of a Palestinian state. Why would anyone stay in negotiations when the people you're negotiating with are doing their utmost, in material terms, to make the two-state settlement impossible? This occurring, btw, because the mediator of these negotiations, the United States, is funneling money into these illegal expansionist housing programmes.
 
 
 
That should have been enough for talks. Get this straight. "talks" - that's all it is, what's all the fuss? Just open dialogue for goodness sake.
Worst case scenario, the other side was not serious and you wasted hours of your time talking - big deal. The possible gain of peace from simply talking and negotiating far outweigh the risk of being the "butt of a joke" by the side which is "not commited" (as some believe). I can't stress this enough.

So fine, Israel conceded to the demand by freezing the settlement building for 10 months - which it didn't need to for the reasons I stated.
Why didn't the Palestinians realise "O, this is the best it's gonna get before right-wingers take more firm control and refuse to play our little game, so we'd better start talking again for the sake of peace". But no, evidently, it's the Palestinians who weren't serious about talks (and still aren't).

 

If memory serves, the Palestinian Authority did enter negotiations, and were persistently asking Netanyahu (as Obama was also) to extend the "settlement freeze". This was the thing that first attracted them back to the table. What would Israel's logical response be? Of course, if they had to negotiate with the Palestinians then the danger would be that they'd have to make concessions on their settlement projects. So Israel didn't extend it, and Obama didn't do anything to make them. The negotiation process was, and is, a farce. It's impossible for the United States to be a legitimate mediator while it shows overwhelming material support for one party. Just look at Obama's veto at the UN a few months ago. It was to reject a resolution that was fully in line with the official U.S. position (condemnation of the settlements as illegal). As I said, for all the flowery rhetoric and farcical negotiation processes, in material terms, Israel are allowed to do whatever they like. And they will do it, because there's no force able to counter it. Their ignoring of the Geneva Initiative and Arab Peace Plan - independent model proposals that are roughly in line with the two-state consensus - tells you all you need to know. If the U.S. tells Israel to do something - like enter negotiations - then they will do, as a means of mutual assurance. If Israel's interests are threatened, then they will show a unilateral initiative (such as the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip). Anything else is simply left alone, because it would jeopardise the settlement projects, which are ongoing and which won't come to an end. Why would any state make concessions when they hold all the aces? Israel don't have to do so in order for their citizens to live a comfortable life.
 
 
 
Israel and the US have been begging for a 2 state solution for years. Its the "palestinians" who refuse to recognise the jewish state as legitimate.

 

Recent events show that's not the case. America came out and said recognising Palestine as a state could be disastrous. I will post up a link to the news article when I find it.

Bit hypocritical don't you think?

Indeed. It's also extremely likely (almost without a doubt, in fact) that the United States will veto the Palestinian statehood bid in the Security Council next month. Yet again it shows that, for any talk about being in favour of a two-state solution, their actions point to the opposite.

No, it would be a disaster if it would be unilaterally without negotiating, and run by the "Palestinian" version of Hamas.
 
 
There will never be peace if there are hardened grudges against one another, from two sides of stubborn religious groups. Either they are taken away, religions become more tolerant, or they are both forced into submission.

None of the above will happen anytime soon.

That's what the whole thing is about isn't it? Israel being the aggressor, having the upper hand in these negotiations. The ball is in their court, but they won't budge.

 Hell these reports show the authorities of Palestine were giving up everything just so they could be recognised as a country 
 
 
 
Well what do you expect when terrorists are in control of an entire strip of land???

 

The Oslo Accords require that Israel allows freedom of movement between Gaza and the West Bank. The Accords also require the PA to suppress terrorism within the Palestinian territories. How were Fatah in Gaza supposed to defeat and flush out Hamas in 2007 when Israel prevented access from the West Bank? Instead, we had Israel launch an invasion on Gaza, which was self-evidently timed overall to co-incide with the build up to the Israeli elections (and the withdrawal timed to co-incide with Obama's inauguration), which only resulted in Hamas being kept in power and over 500 Palestinian civilian fatalities. The Accords are dead whichever way you look at it, and the blockade is part of the problem.

Sorry, but any person from a third person perspective will find that the Palestinians entering negotiations is in the last minute of the freeze a provocative measure. Do you really expect Israel to play the little game of thiers by extending the freeze and stopping the growth of the country further, angering the populace? They entered late to lure Israel into this trap after Israel's generous freeze. I say "generous" as itwas only made for getting something as simple and unexpensive as a conversation (peace talks). So relative to speech, it was generous.

If they had entered at the beginning, 10 months of talks would have been more than great.
Again Israel didn't have to do anything for mere speech.

It is simply quite disgusting that you see eveything Israel does as bad. It can not do good. I'm refering to the Gaza withdrawal and you're baseless claim. The people didn't want to leave, they were quite comfortable. I hate to prolong this (silly) part of the debate, but why didn't they withdraw from WB for "security"?
You conveniently forget the peace with Egypt and Jordan. What about the whole Sinai? The settlements there certainly were doing good.

Israel is a democracy, most of it's citizens support a two-state solution and peace. You speak of "Israel" as if it's seperate from the will of the people.

So what, your saying Israel wanted Hamas to rule so stopped Fatah? Please clarify and bring proof of what you said from the accords.

To call any suspendable freeze on illegal settlement building a "generous" offer is a true distortion of the word. The settlements themselves are a threat to Palestinian self-determination and freedom: small compromises on such expansion are not "generosity" any more than a halt of Moroccan settlement projects in Western Sahara would be, or a halt in British housing projects (for British people) in British-occupied India pre-1948 would have been. Israel, as the aggressor in the occupied territories, is not entitled to the right of continued expansion simply because the inhabitants of the land are playing "little games", or are acting "provocatively". What is more provocative? Building over a thousand new Jewish homes in the area the Palestinians intend to take as their future capital, or delaying the entry to (already farcical) negotiations when Israel freezed it's illegal settlement building? Sure, if you say the latter then I don't see why you'd object to Palestinians (or even Arabs who aren't Palestinian, considering many of the settlers were never even born in the region) impose massive infrastructure and settlement projects in West Jerusalem, Tel Aviv or Haifa? No? Thought not.

(Although this should be complemented with a fairly simple question: why should the Palestinians feel a need to give up the right of return when Israel refuses to give up its right to expand? As it happens, I think both notions are silly, but until Israel gives up the idea of Jewish right of return to Judea and Samaria, what right do they have to tell the Palestinians to give up the idea of - far more tracable - Palestinian right of return to what is now Israel?)

Israel supports the two-state solution in rhetoric only. Materially, they support nothing of the kind.

Considering I never said anything of the sort (RE: 'you see everything Israel does as bad. It can not do good') I feel no obligation to retort.

It should be obvious to anybody that the deals are vital to Israel's security interests (after three wars had already been launched from the relevant countries; I mean Israel rejected a peace deal with Egypt in 1971, but after 1973 it became more urgent). As I've already stated, it doesn't matter what the settlers think - it's logistically and militarily irrational to keep 8,000 illegal settlers sitting on a Strip of land which contains over a million Palestinians (highly concentrated and dense too). It would be an affront to all principles of realpolitik to continue expending valuable Israeli and U.S. taxpayers' money on maintaining the occupation of Gaza when it can be better spent on illegal expansionist housing and infrastructure projects in the West Bank and East Jerusalem (i.e. the areas they care about)

 
Israel is a democracy, most of it's citizens support a two-state solution and peace. You speak of "Israel" as if it's seperate from the will of the people.
 

Considering I didn't deny anything of the kind, I feel no need to comment. I'm speaking about Israeli foreign policy actions, which are the work of government and concentrations of power. It is you who seems to be addressing my criticisms of Israeli government as being synonymous with criticisms of the Israeli population, which is nonsense. If I was talking about the immorality of the Iranian government, I'd generally refer to it as "Iran" in order to save time.

As I said, I meant "generous" in that the only thing you get back is a conversation whilst putting a section of the economy on hold (sections that could end up on the israeli side if land swaps are made). Too much fuss is placed on these settlements for mere talk. If an agreement is made, it's the Israelis who will have to pay the consequences of having built all the houses in the meanwhile because they will have lost them. They will have to dismantle and loose millions in the agreement. And don't say "but extra houses puts pressure for more concessions from Fatah" because it's only negotiations. If Fatah senses unfairness, it can always say "no", but at least there's negotiations going on. Not this ridiculous silent treatment

It is unfair to look at these territories through the lens of the last 10 years. Of all conflicts, it's here where history is the most important factor to get a right perspective. I know you'll view this as propaganda, fair enough, but it gives an idea of what I mean by history. (  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGYxLWUKwWo  ) For example, you talk as if it was actualy conquered from the Palestinian (your india example) but really it was conquered from Jordan. There was no sense of nationalism from the Palestinians - it was only strengthened later due to the Arabs. (not totally sure on the following: ) So the general Israeli feel was "Jordans gone, there are arabs here, leave them, but the lands around it - no probs coz Jordan's not getting it back". I don't think anyone thought back then that the Palestinians would ever want a state.

 
(Although this should be complemented with a fairly simple question: why should the Palestinians feel a need to give up the right of return when Israel refuses to give up its right to expand?

What I said above and: expanding is reversible in any agreement. Expanding is prior to the agreement whilst they want the right of return part of the agreement for the future. Big difference.

 
Israel supports the two-state solution in rhetoric only. Materially, they support nothing of the kind.
 

A fine example of what I accused you of. So what do you believe, they don't want peace, they want there to exist a constant threat to thier existance, for thier citizens to live in fear in many occassions?

Oh, so the agreement with Egypt wasn't generous from the Israeli side  . Saying "oh, but Israel did for security" is silly as that's why countries make a peace agreement for. For the safety, security and happiness of it's populace. However, in the agreement, after constant Egyptian aggression since Israel's birth, it was very generous in every sense of the word. Look at Egypt now and the many calls for ending the peace, quite pathetic really.

Um no, "Iran" does not represent it's people. "Israel" does 95% of the time ( Of course the populace will not agree when the Israeli government makes mistakes from time to time). So it is synonymous most of time - unlike Iran.
 
 
ok
 
 
 
 Israel approves 1,600 settler homes in East Jerusalem
