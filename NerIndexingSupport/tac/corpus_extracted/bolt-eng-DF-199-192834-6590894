 
 
A2K NFL Pick 'Um for Season V (Roman Numeral for 5)
 
 
YES! We are back for our Vth season of this game, run here by idiots for the entertainment of folks who don't know one end of a football from the other. The 1st year we had 6 players and then 12 in the 2nd and it has grown and grown.
The idea is that when the folks around the water cooler talk about the games on Sunday, you -yes, you- can say something like "How about them Bears?'

Here is how it works. Each week a schedule will be posted of the games. It will look like this:
Washington Redskins @ NY Giants
Detroit @ Atlanta
and on for as many as 16 games.
All you have to do is pick the winning team in each game by posting here.

You might say Washington, Atlanta, etc. down through the list. If you know the NFL, that is fine, but there are some folks here who in the past have made choices based on some rather bizarre criteria. They have done quite well based on the cutest cheerleaders or the cuter quarterback. Or numerology, whatever that is.
There are some rules, but we tend to make them up as we go along. I will explain some of them later.
WATCH THIS SPACE FOR WEEK #1.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Here is the schedule for week #1
Thursday:
Washington Redskins @ NY Giants
Sunday:
Detroit Lions @ Atlanta Falcons
Seattle Seahawks @ Buffalo Bills
Jacksonville @ Tennessee (I can't remember their nicknames)
NY Jets @ Miami Dolphins
Kansas City Chiefs @ New England Patriots
Tampa Bay Bucaneers @ New Orleans Saints
St Louis Ravens (or something) @ Philadelphia Eagles
Houston Oilers @ PITTSBURGH STEELERS
Cincinnati (whatevers) @ Baltimore (are they the Ravens)
Carolina Panthers @ San Diego Chargers
Arizona Razorbacks @ San Francisco (whatevers)
Dallas Cowboys @ Cleveland Browns
Chicago Bears @ Indianapolis Colts
Monday:
Minnesota Vikings @ Green Bay Packers
Denver Broncos @ Oakland Raiders

All you need to do, which will take all of V minutes, is to list the teams you think will win.
But, as a needed tie-breaker, you need to suggest a score for the last game.
So, you might say, Washington, Atlanta...ending with Denver (14-13).
Pretty simple, huh?
Some pretty amusing writing goes on in the interim betwixt folks here on A2K you may not typically interact with. That's the idea. Welcome.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Ah, I was hoping we'd have this fine test of prediction failure once again. The good thing about it is I tend to forget how well or badly I did as spring and summer pass. Fresh new turf, or new fake turf to run around on making picks.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

ooh ooh ooh baby
 
 
For absolutely no reason that makes any sense, I will play. I mean, I always end up at the bottom of the pile.

Hey RJB
 
 
@Rockhead,

I haven't even started my advanced picking system yet (where's my frisbee?).

We might get some newbies...
 
 
@ehBeth,

Calm down, ehbeth.
The season kind of snuck up on me, much like a 320 lb tackle slamming into a 5'1o" kicker going for a field goal from the 40 yard line.
I have a long list of players here from years past (like the Cowdocs) but no way of pm'ing them for now.

Don't we use total points in the Monday game as a tie-breaker?
 
 
Since we don't have PMs yet, maybe we can keep this more on the most recent pages by bumping it now and then to give everybody who might be interested a better chance to see it.
 
 
thanks, RJB for starting this great contest again. It's a fun way of hanging out and getting to know new people and joke around with last year's players again.

I'll post mine tonight. Awesome!
 
 
@George,

 
Don't we use total points in the Monday game as a tie-breaker?
 
i was under the impression that rjb changed it this year so he could have a better tie-breaker to work with...

Ah, yes... the tiebreaker.....

28-17
 
 
@jespah,

 
So this is the vith year, eh?

 

Amazing, isn't it? Kickycan started it & we had 6 players. I took over running the thread in mid-season and I won the regular season title. The 2nd year I had 12 players and Kicky came back to win. The 3rd year we were up to 18 players and Chiso from TX won by a very narrow margin. Last season JPB offered to give me a year off from running this. She did a great job, introduced some innovative stats, got 19 regular players and when the dust settled Cowdoc from Idaho was our champion.
A bit of housekeeping: yes, JPB did go to a different deal last year re the tie-breaker. I warned her that Total Points came perilously close to not determining a winner the previous year because of the increased number of players. She put in place an alternative system that would define a path without requiring players to do much more work. I will be using her rules. I just need to find her rules.
For the 1st couple of weeks there are Thursday night games. I hate them. The rule is we are supposed to make our picks prior to the start of the 1st game, which would be Thursday. I am waiving that rule. If you miss that game you can still pick Sunday and Monday games. But you MUST get those picks in before the kick-off of the 1st game on Sunday. I have to enforce that rule rigidly. Back in a bit.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Thanks, Johnboy.

(contemplating RJB, the disciplinarian dude...)

So pick away.
 
 
@Rockhead,

 
(contemplating RJB, the disciplinarian dude...)

 

I hate to come across as harsh, RH, but if being 5 minutes late is okay, how about 15? Or 30? Neither I nor JPB wanted to be put in the situation of deciding how tardy is too tardy. I ticked a couple of people off by enforcing that rule. So it goes.
When we only had a few players I knew that Mike/sublime never woke up on Sunday until just before game time. It was kind of okay that he was a few minutes late.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

oooh, rjb, man with a whip

Hey CowDoc, good to see you. LTNS and welcome to you AND the missus....just so you don't pick better than me, I mean.  
 
 
@Foxfyre,

Yayyy, Cow Doc's here..

Oooh, I have a thread for you to check: Cows as Compasses -  http://able2know.org/topic/121464-1 
 
 
@Foxfyre,

The crowd goes crazy as the defending champion Cowdoc enters the room. It is great to see yall back for another season.

It is a real honor to be competing against Cowdoc (and Ragman) again this year!

@realjohnboy,

I didn't know that Palmer had a broken nose. Starting to think the Ravens voters are right. So it goes, the continuation of doubts.
 
 
@ossobuco,

Which reminds me, Osso, of Article II, Section C, of the A2K NFL Rulebook. Players here may change their picks at any time up to the picking deadline.
I ask that you alert me to the change by putting part of your post in CAPS. Otherwise, I might not see it.
 
 
In order to help minimize confusion, RJB and someone else (Jespah) earlier have been referring to the Arizona NFL team as the Razorbacks. FWIW, they're called the Cardinals. Hope this helps.

Thanks for the kind words, Wandeljw; however, I'm the one truly who is honored.
 
 
@Ragman,

OK. So it is the Arizona CARDINALS. And it is the Baltimore RAVENS? And the St Louis FALLEN ARCHES?

@Ragman,

Wasn't me.
 
 
@jespah,

We have players from Canada, Ireland Mexico and the U.S. 18 players in all. I hope we can find more.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

rjb's got a big spreadsheet and he's not afraid to use it  
 
 
@ehBeth,

 
rjb's got a big spreadsheet and he's not afraid to use it.

 

Which reminds me. JPB did a super job of running this last year. I thought I heard her say she couldn't do it this year. But, Jaye, if you or anyone else wants the job, please say so. I will gladly stick to the trolling for new players and keeping up the banter.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I wasn't going to change.. just whining. But happy to see I could.

I've a question in fantasy football, so I have to find that thread..
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I just threw a few invites down in threads with folks who (mostly) wouldn't have wandered over here.

Good luck to us all.
 
 
@ossobuco,

What was the question?
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Thank you for the kudos, rjb, but I really can't commit this year. Have fun, folks.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

It was about whether one's players were movable before games just like in the baseball fantasy game with the same flexibility to, say, move a guy newly on the bench back to the field another day of the weekend. I posted it, not quite that way, in the fantasy football thread, and Rockhead speedily answered it for me. (Yes you can..)

So now I get it that it's a nice flexible game situation.
 
 
One minute honey, I'll be right there.

Giants
Lions (my hometeam)
Bills
Tennessee(tough pick)

@alex240101,

Thanks, Alex. You need to guss the final score in the Denver-Oakland game.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

It is about 2 1/2 hours until the kick-off of the 1st game. The defending Super Bowl champs, the NY Giants host the team from Washington with the supposedly political incorrect nickname. The Giants are only a slight favorite due to a key retirement and an injury. They do have a fine QB in Eli Manning and the 'Skins have a new coaching staff and 16 of the 19 us have the Giants.
We certainly welcome additional players, for tonight's game plus the weekend's games, or for the 15 remaining games that start on Sunday. Good luck to everyone!
 
 
Wow..where's the water-cooler gab about the game?

OK, I'll start: I watched most of the game. Manning and the offense looked pretty good in spite of the personell changes. OTOH, Wash. Skins are very disorganized. What did they think? That it was still pre-season?!

The 16 of the 19 us that had the Giants are pretty happy.
 
 
@Ragman,

[grumble]
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Denver Broncos seventeen, Oakland Raiders fourteen.
 
 
@Ragman,

 
Wow..where's the water-cooler gab about the game?
 

I am avoiding the water cooler right now. Foxfyre is there consoling a visibly upset George.  
 
 
@wandeljw,

 
 
Wow..where's the water-cooler gab about the game?
 

I am avoiding the water cooler right now. Foxfyre is there consoling a visibly upset George.  

 

The 3rd grumpy players this morning is Edgar. He, Foxfyre and George were the hapless trio who had the 'Skins.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

For me, that's an automatic.
I NEVER pick the Giants (or the Jets).
 
 
@George,

Let me rephrase that.
I will pick the Jets if they happen to be playing the Giants,
but I NEVER pick the Giants.
 
 
16 games this week. 19 players here so far. We are unanimous in picking NE over KC and Denver over Oakland. We are evenly divided on NO (10 of us) vs TB (9) and MN (10) vs GB (9).
Imur disagrees with the majority on 1 game. McGentrix, Osso, Tico, ElStud and George vary from the majority on 2 games.
Marching to her own drummer is Jespah, who disagrees with most of us on 7 games, followed at 6 by Rockhead, Foxfyre and Fbaezer.

Ehbeth: I like the introduction of musical interludes between other posts. A brilliant idea.
 
 
@ehBeth,

Cute.
 
 
@George,

I didn't catch the joke. Can one of yall please explain?
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I disagree with myself by six games, but that is pretty much always true.

What joke?
 
 
@ossobuco,

Mmmmm, nice music.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I failed to pick the Giants.
The song Beth posted was "Fee Fi Fo Fum".
 
 
@George,

Too subtle for me. Redneck humor tends to revolve around sex and bodily functions.

Oh.
 
 
Them Canajuns is right subtle.
 
 
@George,

You're not the first person to note how cute and subtle I am

I just re-read my picks.
Except for my Giants pick, totally boring. Ho-hum.
It's time for The Amazing Giorgio!

Goes back to the Giants winning and the "Fee fi fo fum" song somebody (ehBeth?) was singing earlier? Jack the giant killer? He planted the beans that grew the great bean stalk to get him to the Giant's castle in the sky where he slew the Giant?

(Yeah, it was pretty subtle. And you pretty well have to grow up with Grimm's Fairy Tales and like literature.   )
 
 
@Foxfyre,

Clever. Obtuse, but clever.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Hey. Why am I obtuse and "Fee fi fo fum" wasn't?
 
 
I really thought I had reeled in a couple of new players. But they both ended up declining. Sigh. Ms Cowdoc? Where are you?
"Obtuse?" I rarely get to use that word, and I make up the rules here. So there.

"Obtuse?" I rarely get to use that word
 

You need to hang out on the political threads more.
 
 
@George,

Hey, wait, I thought I hold the Obtuse Crown...
 
 
@Foxfyre,

The inabilty to pm folks really crimps my style, Fox. 19 players is fine, but for me, growing the game has been part of my mission from when this stupid game started 5 years ago. That makes no sense, does it? Kind of obtuse.

I feel your pain RJB. But even the most prosperous enterprises have occasional down turns. Trust me, looking at our modest investment portfolio, I know!   I miss PMs terribly too, but we'll get them back eventually.

Until then just pretend that we're all gorgeous, witty, intelligent, as well as rich and generous and go with quality this year. (Unless we can snag somebody else before morning of course.)
 
 
@Foxfyre,

I just posted another ad. Everybody bump it now and then for the next two or three hours and maybe we'll get RJB his 20th participant. He's such a great guy to help us have fun, we can help him out here.
 
 
@Foxfyre,

Though, he wote he might not, it just wouldn't seem the same without RJB.
 
 
@Ragman,

Did he? Or was that our friend JPB?
 
 
@Foxfyre,

oops, you're right. Intially, I'm wrong.
 
 
@Ragman,

 
oops, you're right. Intially, I'm wrong.

 

Whew. It was disappointing that JPB can't play this year. But I don't think we can fly at all without RJB  
 
 
@Foxfyre,

mebbe if we temporarily stick a politics tag on this - and lay low for an hour or two - someone will be fooled into thinking they're voting for uhhhhh something
 
 
@ehBeth,

I think we need Roz...
 
 
Well anybody who comes in, please check to see where the new "ad" is in the queue and bump it to the top for another hour or two. I'll try to check in too, but I've got some work I just have to get done before morning.

Oh the title of it is: ATTENTION A2K FOOTBALL FANS - LOOK INSIDE - the bumps will also give it more thumbs up to make it look maybe interesting.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Lets see,
I'll take Detroit
Seattle
Jacksonville
Miami
New England
New Orleans
Philadelphia
Houston (BTW, they are the Houston TEXANS, not the Oilers)
Baltimore
San Diego
Arizona
Cleveland
Indianapolis
Minnesota
Denver

And as the tie breaker, I am going to say the final score will be Denver 21 Oakland 7
 
 
@mysteryman,

Hey, mysteryman is here. Good going..
 
 
@mysteryman,

Make it so!
 
 
@mysteryman,

2 truck drivers...

@realjohnboy,

Alright, I hope I can remember to do this every week. Here are my picks.

Washington
Detroit
Seattle
Tennessee
New York Jets
New England
Tampa Bay
Philadelphia
Pittsburgh
Cincinnati
San Diego
Arizona
Dallas
Indianapolis
Minnesota
Denver (24-10)
 
 
@maporsche,

Aha, and now the Porshe's here..
 
 
Woo hoo. Welcome MM & Maporsche  
 
 
Sweet. Welcome to Mysteryman and Maporsche who become players #20 and 21. Maporsche proves that he belongs here by making the incorrect pick in the game already played. That is cool!
 
 
@realjohnboy,

The PorscheMan is showing the courage of his convictions.

Much like the hopeful giant-slayer.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
Less then 2 hours to go before Sunday's 1st game. We are up to 21 players but can certainly handle more. Please consider joining us!

 
YES! We are back for our Vth season of this game, run here by idiots for the entertainment of folks who don't know one end of a football from the other. The 1st year we had 6 players and then 12 in the 2nd and it has grown and grown.
The idea is that when the folks around the water cooler talk about the games on Sunday, you -yes, you- can say something like "How about them Bears?'

Here is how it works. Each week a schedule will be posted of the games. It will look like this:
Washington Redskins @ NY Giants
Detroit @ Atlanta
and on for as many as 16 games.
All you have to do is pick the winning team in each game by posting here.

You might say Washington, Atlanta, etc. down through the list. If you know the NFL, that is fine, but there are some folks here who in the past have made choices based on some rather bizarre criteria. They have done quite well based on the cutest cheerleaders or the cuter quarterback. Or numerology, whatever that is.
There are some rules, but we tend to make them up as we go along. I will explain some of them later.
WATCH THIS SPACE FOR WEEK #1.

 

 
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
 
Here is the schedule for week #1
Thursday:
Washington Redskins @ NY Giants - Too late for this one, but pick the rest.
Sunday:
Detroit Lions @ Atlanta Falcons
Seattle Seahawks @ Buffalo Bills
Jacksonville Jaguars @ Tennessee Titans
NY Jets @ Miami Dolphins
Kansas City Chiefs @ New England Patriots
Tampa Bay Bucaneers @ New Orleans Saints
St Louis Ravens (or something) @ Philadelphia Eagles
Houston Texans @ PITTSBURGH STEELERS
Cincinnati (whatevers) @ Baltimore (are they the Ravens)
Carolina Panthers @ San Diego Chargers
Arizona Razorbacks @ San Francisco 49er's
Dallas Cowboys @ Cleveland Browns
Chicago Bears @ Indianapolis Colts
Monday:
Minnesota Vikings @ Green Bay Packers
Denver Broncos @ Oakland Raiders

All you need to do, which will take all of V minutes, is to list the teams you think will win.
But, as a needed tie-breaker, you need to suggest a score for the last game.
So, you might say, Washington, Atlanta...ending with Denver (14-13).
Pretty simple, huh?
Some pretty amusing writing goes on in the interim betwixt folks here on A2K you may not typically interact with. That's the idea. Welcome.

 

 
 
 
Are you logged into yahoo under the correct user?
 
 
@Rockhead,

You are in the league. You must be using the wrong name, as RH suggests.
 
 
@Rockhead,

He deleted the post and is going to the fantasty football thread, but if somebody could help him there. (He's just learning how to do this stuff.)
 
 
@Foxfyre,

I emailed from Yahoo, hoping he can backtrack.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

cut him some slack, jack -- he just got here...

our tv set will be begging for mercy by about midnight tonight:
..... pates-chiefs
..... jets-'phins
..... sawx
..... tennis
 
 
The Fighting Gerbils once again have conquered hardship..........we backed into it. All is ok now......hopefully. Thanks
 
 
@Region Philbis,

Okay. Forget I wrote that.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Besides, he is in a pretty special group with that. And we're tickled to get him.  
 
 
@Foxfyre,

I made one more effort to recruit the Miz, but she says she's sitting this season out. We'll reserve the right for her to get on board later should she change her mind. Not that a woman would ever do such a thing...........
 
 
It is the group of talented, beautiful, intelligent, thoughtful, cute and athletic people in here!

Or so I've been telling people so we can get someone else to play....  
 
 
Looking at the picks of the latest players to join, Maporsche agrees with the majority of us here-for what that is worth. Mysteryman strays a bit, joining ElStud as the only other player to choose the Houston TEXANS over the Steelers, and, along with Rockhead, Fbaezer and Alex, the only picker of Cleveland over Dallas.
Half hour to go. 21 players here. 9 early (1pm ET) games.
 
 
Good afternoon to everyone. So the early games are over with. 10 games done so far.
So put on your helmets, tighten the chin straps and gird your loins.
"Gird your loins" is a phrase that goes back in our family a long time. My dad remembered his grand-dad using it. If I weren't a dumb redneck with no pedigree, "Gird your loins" would be on our family crest. In Latin, of course. Can you help, George?
But, I digress.

Through the early games, Rockhead, Jespah, Ragman, Fbaezer and Cowdoc have picked 8 of the 10 games correctly. Osso and Wandeljw are at 7. No one of the rest of us gets the dunce cap.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Oh, you mean we were supposed to pick WINNERS before??????????
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Checking the scores, I'm seeing some pleasant surprises. So far. (Just because I select a team doesn't mean I actually expect them to win.. I might just think that it's possible.) For example, I've tended to like Buffalo, but chose against them this time..

Accingite lumbos vestros
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Only 2 games left for Week #1. I think I have 10 correct picks, so far. Does that agree with your data, RJB? (I may have miscounted.)
 
 
@wandeljw,

You're probably right Wandel.

I personally have been afraid to even check mine.  
 
 
@Foxfyre,

Thanks, Foxfyre. Don't be worried, RJB's thread is entertainment only.
 
 
@wandeljw,

Yes and I am enjoying it immensely. Which does not at all change the fact that I have been afraid to check where I am this week and that has nothing at all to do with worry.  
 
 
Mediocre. That is the word to describe our performance in Week #1 so far. Eight of us @ 8-6; one @ 7-6; and four @ 7-7. Three of us racked up more losses than wins. One @ 5-8 and two @ 6-8.
Jespah, Wandeljw and Ragman are at a more respectable 10-4 with the two games remaining for tonight. Fbaezer and Cowdoc are at 9-5.
The 10-4 threesome all have picked GB and DEN so it looks like the tiebreaker will kick in with the 1st deciding factor being total points. Jespah has 27, Ragman has 37 and Wandejw is stuck in the middle with 30. Fbaezer also has GB and DEN so he can not advance. Cowdoc has MN and DEN. So a MN win would get him into a tie. He has 38 total points.
I will post the winners around this time tomorrow along with the schedule for Week #2.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

If I'm in the whereabouts of Ragman and Cowdoc on this game, I'm doin' pretty good.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

medicore...nahh.. I'll bet it's those first-game blues. I'll bet our first week's games last year were some lower scores too. I wonder how similarly we tracked?

Of course, the 2nd week won't be a picnic either - especially with certain franchise players (QB Brady) missing for a game or 2 (or gone for the season.......wahhh!!).
 
 
@Ragman,

the following link shows last year's thread and the scores after the first week. Seems pretty much at the same relative scoring.

 http://able2know.org/topic/101242-13 
 
 
The winner of Week #1 is Ragman. He, along with Jespah and Wandeljw, ended at 12-4. Total points scored in the Denver-Oakland games: 55. Jespah and Wandeljw had expected fewer points than Ragman's pick of 37.
So in 1st place @ 12-4 (.750): Ragman, Jespah and Wandeljw.
In 4th place @ 11-5 (.687): Fbaezer.
The 5th position is a tie @ 10-6 (.625): Realjohnboy, Liontamerx, Cowdoc and Ehbeth.
A bunch of folks clustered for 9th @ 9-7 (.562): McGentrix, Osso, Edgar, Rockhead, Tico, ElStud and Region.
Maporsch holds 16th @ 8-7 (.533).
Tied @ 8-8 (.500) for 17th: Imur and Alex.
In 19th @ 7-9 (.437): Foxfyre and George.
Holding down the 21st slot @ 6-9 (.400) is Mysterman.
The best ESPN picker finished @ 11-5 (.687).
The worst one would fit into our pack, going 9-7 (.562)

So this was only Week #1. Plenty of time for improvement.

Let me know of any errors. Thanks for playing.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Thanks for keeping track of all of it.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Thanks for all your work, RJB! Will Ragman get extra points for being the weekly winner? (I am only concerned because Ragman is always at a disadvantage when playing against me.   )

@Foxfyre,

Can Manuscript Gothic be far behind?
 
 
Since Jespah did so well on week 1, I'll follow one of her methods.
Pick the team with the longest name:

Jacksonville over Bills
Kansas City over Oakland
Indianapolis over Minnesota
Carolina over Chicago
Green Bay over Detroit
Giants over Rams
New Orleans over Redskins
Bengals over Titans
Buccaneers over Hawks
Seahawks over 49ers
New England over Jets
San Diego over Denver*
Arizona over Miami
Baltimore over Houston
Pittsburgh over Cleveland
Philadelphia over Dallas 45 points (28-17)
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Puh-leeeeze. Only the finest calligraphy is acceptable. I must be an expert by now. I've had the tools for at least 30 years and take them out and look at them every couple of years or so.
 
 
@Foxfyre,

Was that Times New Roman Bold?

No just the default typeface on the board whatever that is - changed to large and bold.

@realjohnboy,

Wow...we came down to a 3-way tie and had to resort to a tie-breaker. There are some pretty good football fans and competitors here. It's all in good fun.

RJB: Thanks so much for doing all that work wrapping up of numbers and such. For the most part, those were a bunch of pretty entertaining games with lots of drama. Speaking of drama, I think Philly NOW is a team that should be closely watched and with that Dallas-Philly matchup coming next weekend, we should see who/whom the class of the NFC really is.

Wandel: you do know that I always keep an eye out for where you are in the standings, don't ya?! I used to have watch out for Cowdoc and RJB, - now I gotta watch for Jespah, too. Mercy...! But I bet there'll be a whole new bunch of winners next week as the early season is such an iffy guessing game.

@mysteryman,

Thanks, Mysteryman. I have, temporarily (I hope) misplaced my score card. I think you check in as player #15 this week. I like "...the final score will be..." part. Confidence.

@Ragman,

Sorry, but I just looked over my picks again and see that I picked far too many road teams to beat the homeboys. I gotta make some changes 'cause statistically 12 road teams beating homies CAN'T be right.

Will I act as my own worst enemy?
Here are my revisions:

Jax. Jags beat Buffalo Bills* @ Jacksonville
GB Packers * beat Det. Lions @ Detroit
KC Chiefs beat Oak. Raiders @ KC
Minn Vikes beat Ind. Colts @ Minn.

@Region Philbis,

yeah, I got a Daffy visual as well...
 
 
 
@Rockhead,

 
I heard that!
 
 
I never did find my tally sheet but I am now up to date with yall's picks. 17 pickers so far. We are missing Rockhead (who has said he is working on his), LionTamer, Cowdoc (who posts after the end of the workweek) and Maporsche.
We also need some corrections from Alex.

I note that one of the Sunday games is Baltimore @ Houston. Hurricane Ike looks like it will hit land very near Houston Saturday morning. I haven't heard any plans to change the game's time or place in the event there is damage to the infrastructure or mass movement of displaced residents.
One of our players, Edgar, lives in Houston.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I just took this info off a local channel's website:

HSID has canceled Friday and Saturday football. The Astros may move Friday night's game to 1:05pm. The Houston Cougars have moved their game with Air Force to the SMU campus in Dallas with a 2:30pm start.
And as for the Texans, they're just waiting to see. The ravens may try to fly into Houston Friday rather than Saturday for Sunday's game. But right now, it's all up in the air depending where Ike goes.

Houston is actually 40-50 miles inland which should modify the full brunt of a bad one. With a direct hit they'll get wind and rain aplenty, but are in little to no danger from storm surge. Galveston and others at waters edge will no doubt be advised to move inland but I can't see a large scale evacuation of Houston. Our friends and relatives who live in the area aren't planning to leave.
 
 
Game time of the Houston Texans - Balt. Ravens in Houston has just been rescheduled to Monday at 8:30 pm ET.
 
 
@Ragman,

Good move. There will be a lot of folks from say, Galveston, who will, we can hope, be wanting to return home on Sunday.
We have an A2K thread going called "Hanna, Ike and Josephine." Lots of maps and links to local tv. Perhaps someone smarter then I am could post a link to that.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

No, but I will...

@ehBeth,

ehBeth: I may have spotted an error when you transcribed your game choices:
You had typed, " Benny and the Jets @ Tampa Bay"

However, the actual choices are TB Bucs (not the Jets) or Atlanta Falcons. Which one is your choice for this game?
 
 
@Ragman,

oops transcription error
will look for the scrap of paper at home

or learn a new song  
 
 
@ehBeth,

I put it down as Atlanta, figuring that was some music group from there, I am not into pop culture.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Thass funny. I'll take Atlanta.

I'll save what I'd worked out as a surprise for another round   (I know you're all anxious to see that)
 
 
@ehBeth,

I always enjoy your poetic twists.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

bump, bump. We are looking for a couple of players from last week, and also are welcoming any new players.

 
Here is the slate for Week #2. 16 games, once again, but no Thursday night game. So the deadline for getting in is Sunday afternoon before 1 pm Eastern US time. An * after a team's name indicates they won in Week #1.

Buffalo* @ Jacksonville
Oakland @ Kansas City
Indianapolis @ Minnesota
Chicago* @ Carolina*
Green Bay* @ Detroit
NY Giants* @ St Louis
New Orleans* @ Washington

(And please don't forget to pick the final score in that last game).

If anyone who did not play last week would like to join, we would welcome you. The scoring has been set up such that folks who don't get to pick in every game don't get penalized. We would love to have new players.

Here's the requested link for the Hanna, Ike, and Josephine thread
 http://able2know.org/topic/121862-16#post-3401011 

We probably need to run another ad on a separate thread to generate new interest in this one though. Otherwise folks looking in at the beginning won't realize they can join up even though we've started
 
 
@edgarblythe,

I just heard on the news that once again the Balt Ravens-Texans game has been rescheduled due to storm damage. This time it'll be moved ahead to their (former) bye week which will be on Nov 9th. So one game will be removed from the matches tomorow.
 
 
@Ragman,

Good move by the NFL. Wrong time, wrong place for a game.
 
 
@CowDoc,

Thanks, Cowdoc. But ain't the Ms Cowdoc peering over your shoulder, muttering about some of your choices? I am, of course, not being pushy but we would welcome her wisdom here.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

You are too being pushy. Can I help push?
 
 
@Foxfyre,

Ms Cowdoc played in years past. Let's see: I caught up with LionTamer and Rochead on other threads and dropped in a reminder. I happened to have Alex's email address. Can't locate Maporsche anywhere on my end of the political sphere. Perhaps one of yall can find him.

Happy High Noon (EDT) to yall. I have settled into the anchor desk here in the A2K Sports studio. I have the staples needed: Pabst Blue Ribbon, Ritz crackers and a fresh can of Cheez-Whiz. What could be better?
One thing that could be better would be to get the picks from LiontamerX and Ma porsche. And Alex needs to make a couple of corrections.
I managed, with some shameless pandering, to get Ms Cowdoc to play and also Sublime from Chicago. He played in several of the early years but then kind of drifted away from A2K for a spell. Happy to have him back.

I am looking at our picks this week. All 20 of us picking so far have the Steelers, 18 of us have the Saints and the NY Giants and 17 brethern have the Packers. After that, games are pretty evenly divided, with the Bears-Panthers game being a toss-up.

Ms Cowdoc and Jespah disagree with the majority of us on 6 games. That is no big deal as there are a bunch of folks at 5 and 4. Our friend Edgar agreed with the majority of players in every game.
Edgar, as you probably know, is in Houston. He called Rockhead early this morning to report that he, Ms Edgar and the dog are okay.
The Baltimore @ Houston game scheduled for late afternoon has been moved to early November.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I think Mrs. Cowdoc only had fifteen teams if I'm counting right.
 
 
Welcome Sublime & Miz Cowdoc. I checked on Maporsche and he hasn't posted since early Friday--must be away for the weekend.
 
 
@ossobuco,

Oops, I forgot about the cancelled game. That splains it.
 
 
@sublime1,

You're up early, sublime!

@wandeljw,

I have missed Notre Dame football for many years because I work Sat. This season they show a replay in HD Sundays at 8am so all I have to do is avoid the score and wake up early to once again revel in Irish football.
 
 
@sublime1,

....so that's what it takes to get you up early on sundays  
 
 
@wandeljw,

The bad part is that I feel like I should have a beer while watching then realize that its 8:30 in the morning.
 
 
Anyone with the chefs over the Boys in black can mark a loss.

Some guy I never heard of if running for his life at QB now...

(only game I get)
Chefs just got awfuller...
 
 
@Miz Cowdoc,

Good to see you, Miz Cowdoc and Sublime1 !
 
 
So I have this chart. And it is so neat and tidy. 16 rows down the left plus rows for scores. 25 columns across the top. Each of us gets a quarter of an inch of column. Each of you is worth a quarter of an inch to me.
The early games are over. I attack my nice chart with blue and red highlighters. Blue is a correct pick. Red is a bad one. I used to use green rather than blue but it dried up. I make no political statement by using blue or red.
Through the early games--I have that here somewhere--: there is really not much to report. Five of us have 2 wrong picks; four of us have 5 blunders. Those in the latter category may recover. Perhaps not.
 
 
How 'bout da Bears.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
 
 
I gambled on Minnesota and they led most of the day and then...and then...
 
 
 
Last week I said we were mediocre. This week, so far, we are even more so--if that is possible. 13 games over (Balt@Houston postponed) and 2 to go.
Alex has to wear the A2K clown costume (did yall even know we had an A2K clown costume?) after going 2-9 plus two abstentions.
The rest of us are, as mentioned, undistinguished in our picking success, ranging from 5-8 to 8-5.
Ah, 8-5: Realjohnboy, Foxfyre, ElStud and Imur. Every player here has the Steelers, and the 8-5ers all have Dallas. Tie-town, perhaps, with Fbaezer and Ms Cowdoc joining in the tie if Philly wins.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Oy vey! Sure were some upsets. I'm not sure that I want to see what that changes to my orig. choices did to my week's success rate.

However, all that being said, there were some great football games. Sure is good to have season under way. That Redskins-Saints and Broncs-Charger games were pretty damn interesting. Especially with the way Broncs-Chargers ended and how they scored. Gotta feel bad for a good Charger team being snake-bitten with those 2 games with last-minute officiating decisions. Of course, Chargers still had a chance at the end to do something to change the result, so it's not as tragic as it seemed on the surface. Gotta be the best 0-2 team in many seasons. Charger's next week's matchup with the Jets should be interesting. Sure can't see Jets faring too well with that one, either. This match is in SD. Gotta love Favre, but this is his "Welcome back to the NFL" greeting!

Surprisingly, the Pats win was pretty solid. This shows what a well-run team they are and how deep their talent is (beyond Brady). Moss was basically out of it and they STILL pulled it out. Without being too giddy, let's see what happens when they face a strong playoff-bound team. Jets don't seem to be too strong on either side of the ball...so far.
 
 
@Ragman,

Let this be an example as I'm the 'poster-child for "never-make-a-change-after-your-first-choice"! My changes resutled in a loss of 4 out of 5 points. I'd have been 10-4 if I'd made no changes after my first choices. Only one change resulted in a win. Oh well, at least I didn't put any money on it!
 
 
@Ragman,

You should be consoled by the fact that you have until November to change your mind on the Baltimore-Houston game, Ragman.
 
 
@wandeljw,

hehehe! Too bad there's not much riding on that. Baltimore MIGHT be a playoff team IF they get their act together.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

"abstentions"..? Are you referrng to: picking both Seattle and San Francisco?
As long as there is a red nose.
 
 
@alex240101,

And skipping the NYG @ St Louis game. I tried emailing you @ the blind address (whatever that is) but it failed.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Thanks realjohnboy. My e-mail address is  alex240101@comcast.net . I also have it posted in my profile under occupation.
Week Three:

@alex240101,

Alex's picks for Week #3 are duly recorded. Please return the clown costume, washed and pressed, along with the big shoes and the red nose, to A2K Central. I am sure it will be needed again.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

ROFL

My sis has a "duck umbrella" for karaoke night at the bar. By group vote, one must sing their song under the umbrella as a sign to the newbies to go outside and take a smoke...

Alex is cool, for a Mitten guy...
 
 
@Rockhead,

 
My sis has a "duck umbrella" for karaoke night at the bar. By group vote, one must sing their song under the umbrella as a sign to the newbies to go outside and take a smoke.

 

I guess that makes sense. I guess.
No it doesn't.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I'll 'splain later.

(I rarely makes sense in real time, 'less ya got the inside sheet...)

I needa focus more on this game, as I'm not doin' the fantasy thing. The oddsmakers been takin' it in the shorts of late methinks...
 
 
Week #2: Imur won the week, thanks to his predicting that a lot of points would be scored in last night's tiebreaker game. He said 62 total points. The actual total was 78. It was one of the highest scoring games in Monday Night Football history.
He finished the week at 10-5, tied with Johnboy, Foxfyre and ElStud. Five players came in at 9-6 and six eked out a winning week by going 8-7. Six folks finished below.500.
The standings and next week's schedule coming up shortly.
 
 
Standings after Week #2: Wandejw breaks out of a 3-way tie for 1st with a second good week. His winning average is now.677. Ragman, who was in a tie for 1st last week slips into a tie for 2nd with Johnboy. Their winning % is.645. Noticable is that Johnboy is the only player to have a double digit number of wins in each week. "Mr Consistency."
4th place belongs to Liontamer at.625; he did not play last week.
Fbaezer (.612) is in a tie for 5th with ElStud (who rose from 9th) and Jespah (who sank from a tie for 1st).
Sublime checks in with a decent week (.600) and claims 8th place.
Tied for 9th (.580) are McGentrix, Osso, Edgar and Imur (who rose from 17th).
Tico, Region, Foxfyre and Cowdoc are tied for 13th (.548) with Cowdoc tumbling from 5th after a losing week.
In 17th are Ma Porsche and Ms Cowdoc.
Rockhead, who really needs to start paying attention sits in the 19th slot along with Ehbeth. Each of them did pretty badly last week.
Still in 21st (.466) is Mysteryman who has to be smiling as George (22nd &.451) and Alex (23rd &.413) race to the bottom of the standings.

As always, please let me know if have screwed anything up. Good luck in week #3.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

You'll have my full attention in two weeks here, RJB.

I'm still focused on you till then elsewhere...

(and there's nothin' wrong with hangin' out with Beth, eh?)
 
 
@Rockhead,

 
You'll have my full attention in two weeks here, RJB.

I'm still focused on you till then elsewhere...

 

Oh? RJB peeks through the curtains, looking for a stalker.

@Rockhead,

 
You'll have my full attention in two weeks here, RJB.

I'm still focused on you till then elsewhere...

 

Are you saying you can't walk and chew gum at the same time, Rockhead? Please post your picks before Sunday at 1 pm.
It would be nice to have Edgar get his power back on before then, but I can certainly understand it if this is not on his list of priorities.
Also still missing are Ragman, the Cowdoc family, Liontamer, Ma Porsche, Mysteryman and Sublime. I am not going to start nagging yet.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Obviously my full attention ain't getting the job done, so far...

 
 
 
@Rockhead,

are you working on your short essay?
 
 
@ehBeth,

I'm currently hustling engine parts...

(but yes)
 
 
@Rockhead,

now I've got another freakin' ear worm

and a mental pic of you doing the hustle

(over on another thread was a brief message from Edgar in Houston reporting that he is okay. Cool.) Somebody smarter than me could find that on the "Hanna, Ike and Josephine " thread and link it here.

Your right, I did miss that one.

Giants
 
 
Miz Cowdoc: Please predict the actual final score in the last game, as in San Diego ___ - NY Jets ___. Thank you.
Back in a bit.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Good morning
We have 20 players thus far. I am still hoping to hear from Sublime1. Maporsche seems to be missing from A2K and Edgar has other things on his mind.

There are two games in which we are unanimous. All of us have NE and TN. In three games, we are 19-1. Buffalo, NY Giants and Baltimore get the nod from all but Miz Cowdoc (Oakland), Region (Cincy) and Mysteryman (Cleveland).
We are relatively evenly split on the Pitt-Philly and Dallas-Green Bay games.

Rockhead wins the consistentcy award, agreeing with the majority on all 16 games. Johnboy, Osso, El Stud and Cowdoc agree with the masses in all but 1 game.
At the other extreme are Fbaezer and Miz Cowdoc who disagree with the majority on 6 and 8 games, respectively. They evidentally are under the impression that if they make bad bets, we will bail them out by buying up their losses.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

One last call. New players are still very welcome.

 
Here is the schedule for Week #3:

Kansas City (0-2 this season) @ Atlanta (1-1)
Oakland (1-1) @ Buffalo (2-0)
Cincy (0-2) @ NY Giants (2-0)
Miami (0-2) @ New England (2-0)
Houston (0-1) @ Tennessee (2-0)
Tampa Bay (1-1) @ Chicago (1-1)
Arizona (2-0) @ Washington (1-1)
Carolina (2-0) @ Minnesota (0-2)
Detroit (0-2) @ San Francisco (1-1)
St Louis (0-2) @ Seattle (o-2)
New Orleans (1-1) @ Denver (2-0)
Pittsburgh (2-0) @ Philadelphia (1-1)
Cleveland (0-2) @ Baltimore (1-0)
Jacksonville (0-2) @ Indianapolis (1-1)

Those are the Sunday afternoon games. Sunday night:

My intuition tells me that Sublime is unconscious or maybe semi-conscious right now.(The Chicago Cubs clinched their division title yesterday.)  
 
 
@wandeljw,

 
 
 
@mysteryman,

Mysteryman, as some of yall know, is a firefighter. Here in rural VA, we still have volunteer fire departments. I can be in the local hardware store or even in Kroger, and I will hear cell phones beep and some employees will quite quickly leave.
That is changing as urban sprawl spreads into my area. Not enough volunteers; too many buildings. The VFD is still crucial but not sustainable.
A couple or three years ago I was building a 5-unit town house project on the edge of my property. One Sunday morning I woke up to see 2 fire trucks in the driveway. I was a bit alarmed.
The lead person explained that they tried to monitor all new construction. Where are the driveways, where are the nearest fire hydrants, where are the gas cut-off valves, where are the bedrooms. All of that gets put into a computer that someone on the fire truck can see before they get to a fire. How cool is that?
They let me blow the air-horn before they left.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

We do the same thing with all new construction, as well as all commercial buildings.
Its really helpful when we get to a scene to know what the building layout is, especially if we have to make entry.

As a volunteer firefighter also, I can understand what you mean about the shortage of volunteers.
We are always looking for good people willing to put in the time and work to be a firefighter.
We dont have to worry about urban sprawl here, because this is a very rural county, with farming and coal mining being our largest industries.
 
 
I'm doing sensationally poorly with my picks so far. Ay yi yi.
 
 
@ossobuco,

So am I.
So far, Buffalo is losing, Miami is putting a serious whipping on New England, the Bengals are beating the Giants.

Unless things change, my picks are going to lose badly.
 
 
@mysteryman,

Yeah me too. Last week I took a chance on Minnesota and they led most of the day but lost in the 4th quarter. So this week I said to hell with Minnesota and went with Carolina, the favorite. Minnesota is currently ahead by 10. Sigh.

I suggest you all wait until I make my picks next week and then bet against me. You should do quite well.  
 
 
3 of the early games in OT.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Not any more. So far I'm 3 for 8.
 
 
The early games are over and and we are a rather motley crew. Except for Osso and Imur who are at 6-2. At the other end of the parade is George at 2-6.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I have myself at 5-3 so far. I seem to be doing well with the others but they're only at or around at half-time
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I had me at 5 but I'll cheerfully double check, geez louise. Miami!!

Checked, sad to say, 5 of 8.
 
 
@ossobuco,

I had you choosing correctly WA, TB, TN, NYG, BU and AT.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Did I actually pick Washington?, will go look. If so, I'd changed it before posting.

Aha, I did. Good girl....
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
Buffalo, NY Giants and Baltimore get the nod from all but Miz Cowdoc (Oakland), Region (Cincy) and Mysteryman (Cleveland).
 
nope, i had the jints beating the cints  http://able2know.org/topic/121781-13#post-3404780

@Region Philbis,

Direct snaps musta not been covered in the defensive pregame...  

 

never been happier to lose a bet

(R Brown for Prez...)
 
 
@JPB,

Doing pretty well. Just work, EAT & sleep!! We still love to eat. Come & stay with us some time. We can show you the back country, the real varied country, & the beautiful sites.
 
 
It is selfish of me to ask.....but which of us have a stake in tonight's tiebreaker?
 
 
@Region Philbis,

You are correct Region. The Cincy pick was made by your neighbor in column 13, George.
 
 
@wandeljw,

I have Osso and Imur at 12-3. Osso has SD and Imur has NY. Tico and Cowdoc are at 11-4 and have SD. If SD wins Osso finishes at 13-3 and will take the week outright. If NY wins the week belongs to Imur. Tico and Cowdoc can't gain.
No tiebreaker points needed as I see it.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Just out of curiosity(not being critical at all), I see that you're only listing the points of the top leaders. Will you also list the standing of others with points and percentages of wins./losses as was done last year?
 
 
@Ragman,

I will of course report on Week #3 tomorrow after tonight's 16th and final game. I did that at the end of week #1 and #2. It would be a lot of work to do that after 15 games and then again after the 16th one. Look here around this time on Tuesday.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Agreed. Thanks for reply!

Some of these were pretty good contests. i liked the battle of Western vs Eastern PA. However, shame on the Pats. How many times can you fall for a trick play bfore you figure out how to defend it? Not looking good right for us Pats fan right now. Sure hope they can recoup in the coming bye week and stomp back on 49-ers.
 
 
Thanks for the info, RJB. Some of us were spoiled by JPB's many interim reports and varieties of stats during last year's contest.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
Osso has SD and Imur has NY. Tico and Cowdoc.....have SD.
 

Mmm, sounds infectious....
 
 
@lmur,

NYah, nyah, na nyah nay..

Waves to Imur..

Just watch, he'll wear a cap with a band of braided garlic..
 
 
Half-time, SD 31 - NYJ 14. My back hurts bad; I am going to bed.
When I turned this over to JPB to run last year I warned her: NEVER call a game until it is actually over. If you do, you will get burnt.
See yall tomorrow.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

[consolation] if it stands, i totally nailed the score... [/prize]
 
 
@Region Philbis,

I did ok, thanks be to garlic, but it's another story in the fantasy game (fun anyway).
 
 
@ossobuco,

I put some thought into the right tone to adopt for this losing post.

Gallant loser ? Couldn't be happier etc etc. Great woman, yada yada.
Casual indifference ? Ah well, only a game; sense of perspective blah blah blah.

It's hard to remain objective when you're aware that certain participants have been free with their favours (yanks: note correct sp.) with various match officials.

Yep, I've settled on whinging bitterness.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

How's your back today RJB? Better, I hope.
 
 
@lmur,

You mean that ref whose name starts with an H?
 
 
WEEK #3:
3 weeks & a 3rd different winner. Osso turned in the best performance by anyone so far, finishing @ 13-3. Her miscues were in picking Indy, Carolina and (along with everyone else) New England. Very well done.
Tico, Imur and Cowdoc were close behind @ 12-4 and just behind them came Rockhead & Ragman @11-5.
Johnboy, ElStud, Wandejw, Region & Alex managed to end with Wins in the double-digits. 10-6 for that group.
9-7 was the best McGentrix, Foxfyre, Fbaezer & Mysteryman could muster.
Liontamerx & EhBeth broke even @ 8-8.
Underwater for the week @7-9 were Jespah and Miz Cowdoc. And at the bottom of the pool was George @6-10.
20 pickers in Week #3. Not playing were Edgar, MaPorsche & Sublime1.
 
 
STANDINGS AFTER WEEK #3:
This early in the season with relatively few games having been played, a player who has a very good (or bad) week can expect to see a big move in the standings.
Case in point are Wandeljw & Ragman who have been in 1st or 2nd place since Week#1. Suddenly here comes Osso, rising from 9th to end in a tie for 1st. The 3 of them are now @ 31-16 (.659).
Imur moves from 9th to a tie for 4th with Johnboy @ 30-17 (.638).
Tico & Cowdoc go from 13th to 6th, joining ElStud. They are @29-18 (.617).
Asleep in the 9th position @ 9-6 (.600) is Sublime1. Fbaezer (28-19.595) slips to 10th. Edgar (18-13.580) has 11th.
McGentrix, Region & Rockhead (after a good week) share 12th (27-20.574).
In 15th (26-21.553) are Foxfyre & Jespah.
Only 5 wins at the most separate the 16 players above.
The missing Maporsche & Liontamer are in 17th (.533).
Ehbeth (24-23.510), Mysteryman (23-23.500), Alex (22-23.488) & Miz Cowdoc (15-16.483) are in 19th through 22nd respectively.
I guess that is everyo...No! wait a minute. I see someone back in the distance. It's George! In 23rd is George (20-27.425). George is now 11 Wins behind the leaders. George has put together 3 out of 3 weeks in which he has more losses than wins. Way to go, George!
The best ESPN guy is doing well: (32-15.681) He would be leading here. The worst guy would be in 10th (28-19.595)

Let me know of any errors and next week I will put this in an easier to read format.
 
 
Good day all. Going out of town for the remainder of the week.
Week Four:
Tennessee
Denver
San Francisco
New York Jets. (risky, but I have faith)
Tampa Bay
Atlanta(more dice rolling)
Jacksonville
Cincinnati(
San Diego
Buffalo
Dallas
Philidelphia
Monday Night Football: Baltimore 27-24
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
I guess that is everyo...No! wait a minute. I see someone back in the distance. It's George! In 23rd is George (20-27.425).
 

George is a good sport whose only reason for playing is to make others look good. We all owe George a big Thank You!  
 
 
Hmmm.. So I'm in 15th place--honored to share that slot with Jespah--but we're only 5 wins out of first place? I think I let ESPN advise me on the power ratings last week. I think I'll let somebody else this week.  
 
 
WEEK #4 SCHEDULE ---
We only have 13 games to pick this week. 6 teams have byes.
In addition to each team's record, I have this week included Points For vs Points Against. That should muddy things up a bit.

Bye week teams: Detroit, Indianapolis, Miami, New England, NY Giants and Seattle.
 
 
Johnboy quickly goes for:
Cincy (they can't both lose)
Jacksonville
Atlanta
Denver (romp, romp, romp)
New Orleans
Arizona
Tampa Bay (home field advantage the only deciding factor)
Tennessee (romp)
Buffalo (can you say romp)
San Diego
Dallas
Philadelphia
Pittsburgh (21-20)

Football helmet off, baseball hat on, as Johnboy goes into the 2nd and deciding week in the Fantasy Baseball championship. Playing the tag team of JPB and Rockhead (aka Squirrels). I am ahead for the moment. But I can see the lead slipping away.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I, on the other hand, am vying for 9th with Pantalones, a worthy fellow.

Thanks!
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
I guess that is everyo...No! wait a minute. I see someone back in the distance. It's George! In 23rd is George (20-27.425). George is now 11 Wins behind the leaders. George has put together 3 out of 3 weeks in which he has more losses than wins. Way to go, George!
 

This will just make my come-from-behind victory all the more dramatic.
 
 
I note that Maporsche is back on A2K after an absence of a week or so. If one of yall knows him better than I do, please invite him back to this game. My fall-back plan is to interrupt him on some unrelated thread that I don't hang out at. I hate to do that.
This week, if I can get him, can wake up Subline1, and get Edgar's power back on, is to go for a record of 23 players. That has never been done before.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Message left for Mr. Maporsche HERE:  http://able2know.org/topic/122934-3#post-3411932 

Until everybody gets this thread tagged, we may need to go after them that way. Anybody know what thread Sublime is hanging out on?
 
 
@Foxfyre,

He doesn't hang out, he shows up...
 
 
@Foxfyre,

I saw him on an exercise thread on Sunday morning before kickoff and nudged him, but he apparently didn't check the thread.
I used to be the nudger, back when we had pms. I only nudge once.
Some folks get aggravated.
And, we're all grown ups.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

What about inviting CI? He played every game last year and did pretty well.
 
 
@Foxfyre,

You are good, Foxfyre. Damn good,
 
 
@Ragman,

CI said he would be traveling again during the bulk of the season. That guy is amazing. I happen to know how old he is.

@realjohnboy,

ok..yeah,...Bless hm and as he's said (publicly), he's not 100% well, either. He'll be missed in the contest this year.
 
 
@ossobuco,

It looks like George & Maporsche share an interest in running. I am looking to George to drag him back in if he is interested.

@George,

Thanks, George. Can you get Maporsche back in? You seem to share an interest in running. Thanks.
Yeah, Tico. Missing Houston vs Jacksonville.
 
 
Ignore the man dressed in black behind the curtain as he spells out the rules for how the tiebreaker points work. It looks like it may perhaps become a factor this week. I don't care whether you like the system or not. These are the rules in the event of a tie in Wins vs Losses:
1) Total # of points in the Monday night game;
2) Closest to the winning team's points in the Monday night game;
3) Closest to the losing team's points in the Monday night game;
4) Closest to the home team's total points in the Monday night game;
5) Closest to the road team's total points in the Monday night game;
6) Whichever player scored fewer points in the previous week (or the week before that etc.)
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Sounds good. If I'm in there (doubtful, I'll be glad to get 4 out of 13 this time), I'm the only one so far who picked the abysmal cleveland over the abysmal cincinnati. Even worse, I almost picked washington.
 
 
@ossobuco,

I thought Region picked Cleveland too?
 
 
@Foxfyre,

If so, that's great! oh, to vie for a tie!

I always knew he is smart.
 
 
@ossobuco,

ElStud (not Region) has Cleveland.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
WEEK #4 SCHEDULE ---
We only have 13 games to pick this week. 6 teams have byes.

Ah so he did. Could have sworn I saw Cleveland on Region's too. But it wouldn't be the first time I could have sworn I saw something that wasn't there. (I'm very active on Phoenix's most embarrassing senior moments thread.)

Good morning! We have 20 players this week. Liontamerx, Maporsche and Sublime are missing.
I have been trying to track down Tico, who skipped making a pick in the Houston-Jacksonville game.
We are unanimous in picking Jacksonville, Denver and Buffalo and nearly unanimous in going for San Diego, Dallas, Philadelphia and Tennessee.
We are much more closely divided on the San Francisco-New Orleans and the Green Bay-Tampa Bay games (11-9) and Pittsburgh-Baltimore game (12-8).

George (aka last-place george) decided to get more conservative in his picks this week. He and Edgar agree with the majority in every game. At the other end of the spectrum are Miz Cowdoc and Alex. They disagree with the rest of us on 6 and 5 games, respectively.

On an unrelated note, Johnboy and his Rappin' Rednecks team are poised to win the A2K Fantasy Baseball championship, knocking off the carpetbagger manager, Rockhead, who was brought in to run the Flying Squirrels. I am working on my victory speech, which will be televised later tonight.
 
 
@Rockhead,

Not meaning to be too nosey, but how come? It's always fun to see your picks and comments, etc.
 
 
@Ragman,

Got to find a job.

Misplaced my old one...
 
 
@Rockhead,

"Work!" (Maynard G. Krebs exclamation)

I've not worked in over 7 months. Now I'm on 13-week-extension of Unemployment bennies. After that, I'll be selling my body or pencils (no resemblence to pencil). Yes, I'll starve.
 
 
@Ragman,

I don't do unemployment, and my internet bill has been a hefty expense of late.

I'll be back...

(good luck to you as well)
 
 
Bummer, Ragman and Rockhead.
There was a comedy show on, I think, radio. Might have been Bob and Ray. An ending line was, as I recall, "Write if you get work and hang by your thumbs."
Does anyone remember that?
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I remember the show, not the joke.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
I have been trying to track down Tico, who skipped making a pick in the Houston-Jacksonville game.
 

Ooops. Meant to pick Houston.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I do recall bob and Ray..and in fact use that line "Write if you get work" often.
 
 
@Ragman,

I will post that query on a thread with a wider audience.
 
 
Can someone please explain how a team scores two points? I notice Raiders are 5 points ahead and two of those came from summat called a "safety". Whazzat?
 
 
@lmur,

If a player on offense, carrying the ball, gets stopped in his own end-zone, the other team gets 2 points. Called a safety. The team giving that up then has to kick-off from the 20 yard line.
 
 
Good afternoon to all of you. The 8 early games are done. Just 5 to go this week.
Jespah, Ragman, Fbaezer and Cowdoc check in at 6-2. Everyone else is in the middle. Except Ehbeth, who is at 2-6. She would have been joined by Tico, but his missing (and wrong) pick came in too late.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Thanks rjb.
 
 
Good evening to yall. Washington beat Dallas? Who would have thought that might happen? Miz Cowdoc did.
11 games over with and we have 4 leaders here, tied at 8-3. Jespah, Ragman, Fbaezer and Cowdoc. El Stud is at 7-4. The rest of us are settling in at 6-5 or 5-6.
Ehbeth and Tico get mention as being...um...not so good so far.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

grrrr

I'm going back to picking by hairiest mascot or something like that. it was more reliable than this dartboard approach.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I'm not at 7-4 too? The misses I figure were Denver, San Francisco, Arizona, and Dallas.

Dang Dallas.  

Last week I took a chance on KC thinking they were ready to play inspired. They didn't. So this week against Denver, no contest. Right? Yeah right. Not!
 
 
@Foxfyre,

I have you down as wrongly picking Cincy, Foxfyre.
 
 
@ossobuco,

 
Sounds good. If I'm in there (doubtful, I'll be glad to get 4 out of 13 this time), I'm the only one so far who picked the abysmal cleveland over the abysmal cincinnati. Even worse, I almost picked washington.

 

Hah.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
I have you down as wrongly picking Cincy, Foxfyre.

 

You're right I did. Marked it wrong on my own score sheet.

Sigh.

Oh well. Middle of the pack is good. Lotsa good company there.  
 
 
@ossobuco,

Osso, ElStud, Fbaezer and Cowdoc picked Cleveland.
 
 
How about those Bears!
 
 
@wandeljw,

Pooh!
 
 
@ossobuco,

Double Pooh. (Though it was much better for Chicago to win to help out our Cowboys but I did pick Philly) Sure isn't doing anything for my soothsayer reputation though.
 
 
@Foxfyre,

Foxfyre and osso were not the only ones who picked Philadelphia. (I was just trying to be obnoxious since the majority picked Philadelphia.)
 
 
@wandeljw,

LOL. It's okay to be obnoxious in football, Wandel. (But I didn't think you were being obnoxious.)
 
 
Wandeljw and Miz Cowdoc were the only players to pick Chicago.
With just the game between Baltimore and Pittsburgh remain, there are 4 players in contention win the week. Jespah, Ragman, Fbaezer and Cowdoc are tied at 8-3. Jespah is alone in picking Baltimore. If she is right she wins the week out-right. A Pittsburgh win will send us to the tie-breaker. Ragman sees a final score of 23-10 (total 33), Fbaezer says says 20-13 (33) and Cowdoc has it as 21-9 (30). A Pittsburgh win with total points of 31 or fewer will give Cowdoc the title. Pittsburgh winning with a total score of 32 or more will send us to the 2nd tiebreaker.
I sort of saw this coming and laid out the tiebreaker rules a couple of pages ago. The second one on the list gives the week to the person who is closer to predicting the home team's points.

Back tomorrow with the results for all of us.
 
 
As on Week 1.
The company of Jespah, Ragman and Cowdoc is in itself flattering.
 
 
@fbaezer,

Ah, you're a sweetheart {smooch}
 
 
@fbaezer,

^5, fbaezer.
 
 
Good evening. Ragman wins week #4 based on our having to go to a 2nd tiebreaker for the first time in our 5 year run here on A2K. Ragman wins for the 2nd time this year.
The week ended with Ragman, Fbaezer and Cowdoc at 9-4. (My post above reporting 8-3 going into Monday night's game should have read 8-4). The total points scored came in at 43. That left out Cowdoc, who predicted 30 while the other two had 33. The next tiebreaker was points by the home team (PI-23). There was where Ragman won; he had 23 while Cowdoc had 20.
As for the rest of us: Jespah finished at 8-5. Clumped at 7-6 were RJB, Edgar, Foxfyre, Elstud, Wandeljw, Region and Miz Cowdoc. On the flipside at 6-7 were McGentrix, Osso, Rockhead, George, Imur and Alex.
Not doing too well this week were Tico at 5-7, Mysteryman 5-8 and Ehbeth at 4-9.
Maporsche, Liontamerx and Sublime1 did not play.
 
 
And here are the standings after 4 weeks - 60 games for most of us:
1) Ragman (winning % of.667)
2) Wandejw (.634)
2) Cowdoc (.634)
4) Realjohnboy (.617)
4) Osso (.617)
4) Fbaezer (.617)
7) Elstud (.600)
7) Imur (.600)
9) Edgar (.569)
10) Jespah (.567)
10) Region (.567)
12) Tico (.567)
13) Foxfyre (.550)
13) Rockhead (.550)
13) McGentrix (.550)
16) Miz Cowdoc (.500)
17) Alex (.483)
17) Mysterman (.483)
19) Ehbeth (.467)
20) George (.434)

Changes in standings of note were Tico (who went from 6th to 12th); Jespah (15th to 10th), Fbaezer (10th to 4th) and Miz Cowdoc (22-16). It is still pretty volatile.

The best ESPN guy (.684) would be in 1st place. The worst (.617) would share 4th.

@ossobuco,

Thanks, Osso. Your picks get us up to 13 players in. Looking for McGentrix, Rockhead, ElStud, George, Cowdoc and Miz Cowdo, and Mysterman.
Also, from the land of the missing, Liontamerx, Maporsche and Sublime1.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

McG may be involved with his family/friend weekend vacation. RH is still around, I think; George is bound to show up.. C and MrsC, I'm hopeful about. Mysteryman, haven't seen him posting..

The later three are ephemeral, hope to see them.
 
 
@ossobuco,

The Amzing Giorgio in in DEEP PONDER mode...
 
 
@George,

I took my troubles down to Madame Ruth,
You know, that gypsy with gold-capped tooth.
She's got a pad down on 34th and Vine
Makin' little bottles of Prediction Potion Number Nine.

I told her that I had no luck with picks.
I've been this way since 1956.
She looked at my hand and she made a magic sign.
She said what you need is Prediction Potion Number Nine.

She bent down, she turned around and gave me wink
She said "I'm gonna mix it up right here in the sink".
It smelled like turpentine, it looked like India Ink.
I held my nose. I closed my eyes. I took a drink.

I didn't know if it was day or night.
I started picking every game in sight.
But when I picked the Giants to lose by 29,
I dropped my little bottle of Prediction Potion Number Nine.

@ossobuco,

McGentrix said early on in the week that he would be coming. The Cowdoc's always pick on the weekend. Rockhead I can chase down. I will have to go looking for Mysteryman.
 
 
@George,

Very good, George. That made me laugh.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

ELStud posted his picks here, rjb.

@lmur,

Me too, v. good, Giorgio..

(oh, no, what if you're right..)
 
 
@lmur,

Right. He was bragging that he was first to post this week.
 
 
@Foxfyre,

I don't know how Elstud made it onto my list of players missing. He was dutifully logged in.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Maybe you needed a stud-finder thingy?
 
 
@Ragman,

I just noticed Mysteryman has posted on the VP Debate thread. I will look for an oportunity to remind him to makes his picks. Probably not going to do it there. I hope pm's come back soon.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I will, I'm either fearless or stupid, the jury has been sequestered...

(didditt)
 
 
@Ragman,

I have two of them, probably a good thing.

@realjohnboy,

I would translate Tejas as Texas so it would follow that Tejans would be Texans? See if Houston is missing.
 
 
Good morning. It's a beautiful day in the mountains of Virginia; another in a series of fine days. Temperature might get to 72. Some of the trees are starting to change color.
In this football thing, maybe it is an easy week, or perhaps we are as a group just feeling agreeable.
We are unamimous in picking Carolina and Dallas to win. On almost all of the rest of the games most of us concur. We are fairly evenly split on the Jacksonville-Pittsburgh and Washington-Philadelphia games. I understand from someone who actually watches games that the Redskins played very well last week in beating Dallas. Well executed offense and defense.

McGentrix and Wandeljw agree with the majority on every game (assuming we call the WA-PH and JAX-PI games as tossups).
Osso, Edgar, Jespah, Ragman, Imur and Fbaezer agree with the rest of us in all but one of the games. It is interesting to note that the game that they disagree with the majority on is different for each of them.
The outlier (a word I learned from the political polling threads) this week is Alex, with 5. Tico is at 4.
An hour and a half until the 1st game. Anyone else is welcome to join us.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Thanks for the summary..
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
McGentrix and Wandeljw agree with the majority on every game
 

I prefer to say: "the majority agrees with me."  
 
 
Carolina is running through KC at will...

(Dolphins are kickin' bolt ass!!!)
 
 
Anybody got a paper sack? (Texans fan)
 
 
@edgarblythe,

Yeah Ed, they kinda belched that one...

KC 00 ~ Carolina 34

(and it wasn't that close)
 
 
@Rockhead,

Just before the wheels came off, I asked the TV screen, "What will they do to give it away this time?"
 
 
I was happy about Miami and Atlanta winning though I didn't pick them..
 
 
So the early games are over. 8 of them. I used to call them the 1 pm games. I got an objection to that, suggesting that using ET was eastern elitism. So now they are the early games..
We got hurt bad in the Green Bay-Atlanta game. Only Ehbeth got that one right. Rockhead and Alex had Miami beating San Diego.
Beyond that, it is looking pretty close. Stay tuned.
 
 
@ossobuco,

 
I was happy about Miami and Atlanta winning though I didn't pick them..

 

Me either and my Great Bend defense in Fantasy Football took a horrendous beating. The late games aren't shaping up any better either. Tampa Bay has Denver pretty well shut down and Arizona is tromping Buffalo. I presume we all picked Dallas and that's working out fine.  
 
 
Wow! After 12 games we have a 5 way tie at the top. At 9-3 are McGentrix, Rockhead, Fbaezer, Ehbeth and Miz Cowdoc. The rest of us can only watch.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I think McG was copyin' off'n me...

(where is the protest form?)
 
 
@realjohnboy,

....but with 2 games to go still...can't the ones who are 8-4 rally?
 
 
@Rockhead,

Just a note, Rockhead. You and McGentrix each got to 9-3 in your own ways. You differed on four games.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

RJB, I'm just teasing the gent, nobody plays like me...

 
 
 
@Ragman,

 
....but with 2 games to go still...can't the ones who are 8-4 rally?

 

Well, I guess yes. If Pittsburgh and Minnesota win...
 
 
Dallas did their dangdest to lose today but couldn't quite get it done. Denver pulled their chestnuts out of the fire but I picked Tampa Bay - oy. Mediocre Arizona stomped undefeated Buffalo and New England got it done which helped here and sealed my death warrant in Fantasy Football.

So as we go into the last two games this week, I'm fighting to hold onto my astonishing.500 record.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

hmmm? well..I'm a little confused. If I'm 8-4 now and I picked Jax Jags and NO Saints does that mean I can't win?
 
 
@Ragman,

I think 2 of the guys with 9-3 did pick Jax.
All of us tied with 9-3 picked N.O.
 
 
@fbaezer,

I got Jax...
 
 
@fbaezer,

thanks..that helped shed light.
 
 
@Rockhead,

 
RJB, I'm just teasing the gent, nobody plays like me...

 

 

It's true.
 
 
Here is the clarification of where we are with just the Minneapolis @ New Orleans left.
We have a 3 way tie at 10-3: McGentrix, Fbaezer and Ehbeth. All three have the Saints. If they are right, they will tie at 11-3. McGentrix has the final score being 17-9 (26); Fbaezer- 31-17 (48) and Ehbeth 24-21 (45). If total points are 47 or more the week belongs to Fbaezer. Ehbeth takes the prize if the total score is between 38 and 46. 36 or less clinches it for McGentrix. Exactly 37 gets us into a second tiebreaker.
At 9-4 are Edgar, Rockhead, El Stud, Wandeljw, George and Miz Cowdoc. Any one picking NO can't gain. But El Stud and George have MN. So if MN wins there would be a 5 way tie. El Stud has the final score as 26-24 (50) and George sees it as, hmm, 26-24 (50). That would be an amusing outcome if MN wins and by total points being 50 or more.
Back tomorrow with the full results.
 
 
If New Orleans wins tonight, I will have my first week where I picked more winners than losers. If Minnesota wins I will maintain my great.500 record. So I can't lose.  

(Be afraid - be very afraid. I can pick 100% any week now. Yeah right.)
 
 
@realjohnboy,

It would be a real headache if MN wins. Let's just declare New Orleans the winner. Nobody wants to watch tonight's game anyway.

Amusing... LOL
 
 
@McGentrix,

So George and El Stud share the winner's circle this week? (I picked Minnesota twice and they caved at the end. So this week I pick New Orleans and Minnesota wins. Advice to the group: pick whatever I don't.)

However, I did bravely defend my.500 percentage.  
 
 
@Foxfyre,

[thud]
 
 
@George,

Something just happened to George. I guess realjohnboy will have to give the victory to El Stud.  
 
 
@realjohnboy,

This from about a half a dozen pages back:

 
Ignore the man dressed in black behind the curtain as he spells out the rules for how the tiebreaker points work. It looks like it may perhaps become a factor this week. I don't care whether you like the system or not. These are the rules in the event of a tie in Wins vs Losses:
1) Total # of points in the Monday night game;
2) Closest to the winning team's points in the Monday night game;
3) Closest to the losing team's points in the Monday night game;
4) Closest to the home team's total points in the Monday night game;
5) Closest to the road team's total points in the Monday night game;
6) Whichever player scored fewer points in the previous week (or the week before that etc.)

 

I'll be here shortly with the winner.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

This from last Tuesday:

 
week #4:
As for the rest of us: Jespah finished at 8-5. Clumped at 7-6 were RJB, Edgar, Foxfyre, Elstud, Wandeljw, Region and Miz Cowdoc. On the flipside at 6-7 were McGentrix, Osso, Rockhead, George, Imur and Alex.

 
 
 
@realjohnboy,

So an unprecedented 5 players finished the week at 10-4. The final score last night was Minnesota 30 New Orleans 27. 57 points in total. The 1st tiebreaker is based on which player was closest to predicting the total points. That eliminated Mcgentrix (26), Ehbeth (45) and Fbaezer (48). Left standing were El Stud and George (both with 50). That quickly moved us to the next tie-breakers. which turned out to useless since both ElStud and George chose identical the same final score (26-24).
The final tiebreaker is which player did worse last week (a rather quirky choice for a tiebreaker but it struck me as oddly appropriate for A2K).
In the quote above note that George was 6-7 and ElStud was 7-6 in Week #4.
GEORGE WINS! GEORGE WINS! GEORGE WINS!
 
 
@realjohnboy,

I tanked under pressure.  

(where is my cubs hat...)
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Wait. What?
I won because I did worse ?
That's quirky all right!
 
 
@George,

We (I think JPB's fingerprints may be on the tiebreaker rules along with mine) came up with the system last year when she ran this game. We decided to reward mediocrity.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

Well way to go George, and compliment to El Stud as the runner up.

For myself, I am most honored to share the company of all those I lost with....again.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

The way I've been picking, mediocrity would be an upgrade.

@lmur,

Uh, Oh.
 
 
Congrats George...............weird huh? Who'd a thunk it?
 
 
@ElStudHoncho,

See Johnboy screw-up. Screw-up, screw-up, screw-up. See, see, see.
My apologies. I will try to better.
 
 
Here are the results from Week #5:
At 10-4 were McGentrix, ElStud, George, Fbaezer and Ehbeth.
Edgar, Rockhead, Wandeljw and Miz Cowdoc finished at 9-5.
Osso, Jespah, Region, Ragman, Imur and Cowdow gathered together at 8-6.
Mysteryman skipped a game and wound up at 8-5.
Johnboy, Tico, Foxfyre, and Alex broke even at 7-7.
None of us finished with a losing record this week.
 
 
@realjohnboy,

 
See Johnboy screw-up. Screw-up, screw-up, screw-up. See, see, see.
My apologies. I will try to better.

 

If that's the worst screw up you have this week, you'll be way ahead of 99% of the folks on the planet. Thanks so much for taking your time and talent to make this fun for us RJB.
