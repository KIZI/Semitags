I support clemency mainly because I oppose the death penalty. I am thinking Scwarzenegger might garnt clemency to garner political support from the left after his disastrous special election defeat.

SOUTH CENTRAL'S HOPE: CLEMENCY FOR WILLIAMS
Condemned killer helped invent the L.A. gang lifestyle, but many in this impoverished area don't want to see him die

Peter Fimrite, Chronicle Staff Writer

Saturday, December 10, 2005

Los Angeles -- In the heart of South Central Los Angeles, a place so immersed in the gang lifestyle that even the schools are affiliated with either the Crips or the Bloods, Shiloh Badili paints.

The 52-year-old muralist, like many others in this impoverished flatland, knows what it is like to mourn a relative killed by what he calls "the meanness."

He also knows, as everybody here knows, that Stanley Tookie Williams, the man scheduled to be executed Tuesday morning at San Quentin State Prison, played a pivotal role in plunging the neighborhood down that dark path when he started the Crips gang 35 years ago.

Badili, nevertheless, believes that Williams' life should be spared. He believes it, he said, for the same reason he scrapes together his pennies to purchase paint and bathe vacant storefronts and buildings with colorful images.

"Just like that mural is reawakening the neighborhood, turning something bad into something good, Tookie is using his incarceration time that usually makes people miserable to make life better for others," Badili said. "Commuting his sentence could be the good thing that allows good to blossom here in South Central."

Badili speaks, generally, for many people in South Central Los Angeles, where the plight of Williams is on everybody's mind. An informal street-corner survey by The Chronicle found people sympathetic to the families of Williams' victims but no one favoring his execution. "Spare Tookie" is the refrain on the streets and in the liquor stores, beauty salons and churches.

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has said he will issue a decision on clemency by Monday.

The Williams case has become a cause, like Rodney King, whose beating by police in 1992 sparked widespread riots in Los Angeles. The people are at once full of hope and afraid that if Williams is executed, the same thing will happen in South Central that happened in the King case.

"If they kill him, there is going to be a riot," said hair stylist Shelton Carter, 43, as he stood at the checkout counter of the West-Vern Liquor & Deli store in an area known as the "Rolling 40s" or "40 Crips," gang lingo that has been adopted even by the police. "I know that he was wrong, but he wrote books and has taken up the cause of stopping gang violence. How is he going to do that if he is dead?"

Williams, convicted of murdering four people in 1979, was widely feared inside and outside prison until he renounced gangs. Over the past decade, he crusaded against gangs, wrote eight children's books opposing the gang life, brokered truces between rival groups and was nominated for several literary awards.

He denies he committed the murders, and many people in his former stomping grounds believe him. There is, and has been at least since Rodney King, rampant suspicion of law enforcement and the justice system in South Central, where police and persecution are considered virtual synonyms.

His case is personal even for residents of his old neighborhood who believe he is guilty, because they have seen the same poverty, lack of education and opportunity that he did. Their support for clemency is, they say, a belief in the redemptive power, and value, of penance, which they believe should count for something.

Brenda White, a 49-year-old employee at a fashionable clothing store at the corner of West Vernon and South Western avenues near Williams' childhood home, said she believes that people can change, that while some mistakes cannot be forgiven, all lives can be redeemed.

"If they put prisoners in there and they reform, that's what it is all about," said White, who knew Williams when she was young and thought he was a "nice" guy. "I believe in the death penalty, but people who change their lives for the better should get a second chance."

White said she struggles every day trying to keep her 15-year-old son out of gangs. She gets down on her knees and prays when he leaves for school.

"I am conflicted in a way because Tookie should never have gotten the gangs started in the first place," she said. "But what he says now might make a difference -- it might save other lives. That should play a part in the clemency decision, or else what sense is there in it?"

There are no illusions in South Central about how much of a problem gangs are in Los Angeles. The Crips, who outnumber the Bloods by almost 2 to 1, have as many as 30,000 members, compared to 2,000 at most during Williams' time, and the two gangs have spread to many other cities, according to gang experts.

There are so many different Crips offshoots that the various groups have split the city into what they call "sets," regions that they control. Drug dealing is rampant, drive-by shootings are common and citizens, business owners and even politicians are targets of intimidation.

The Crips gang formed as a kind of community watchdog group in 1971 after the demise of the Black Panthers. Originally called "Avenue of the Crib," the name was shortened to Cribs and later Crips after it was repeatedly mispronounced, according to Donald Bakeer, the author of "South Central LA Crips," the definitive book on gang life between 1971 and 1986.

Williams founded the "West Side Crips" in South Central, the name an indication that their territory was west of the Harbor Freeway. A man named Raymond Washington founded the "East Side Crips," Bakeer said. He was shot dead in 1979.

The black student union at UCLA wrote a constitution for the Crips in the 1970s, defining the name as meaning "Community Revolution in Progress." The revolution that occurred was a great deal more devastating to the community than the students ever dreamed, and unfortunately, Bakeer said, it is still in progress.

"They were always violent, and Tookie had his fingerprints on lots of murders," said Bakeer, who was a teacher at Williams' former high school. "But the real holocaust is the thousands who have been killed by Crips in South Central L.A. and who are still being killed. As a schoolteacher, I've known over 100 people who've been killed by Crips. It is a constant death rate."

Still, Bakeer said, he supports clemency, not because he feels anything for Williams personally but because of the service he can be to young people from behind bars.

"He discovered what I discovered from teaching in the schools in South Central that the solution is literacy," Bakeer said. "When boys can't read, they have no chance. That's why I want Tookie to stay alive. He is the only one writing to this segment of African American society."

Former Crips member Tommie "T-top" Rivers spent 10 years in prison for gang-related crimes before realizing how ruinous the lifestyle was for him and the community. At 36, he now runs a nonprofit dedicated to helping gang members change their ways. He believes the fight against the gang lifestyle can only be won if former gang members are on the front lines.

"It is imperative to stop it, and it can be stopped," Rivers said. "Tookie is a vital part of that effort. Who better to help stop it than the person who started it? I'm a living example of how second chances can work."

What is at stake, said the Rev. Lewis Logan, pastor at Bethel AME church in the middle of gang territory, is hope for the many people who have taken wrong turns in life.

"You have an issue where hopelessness drives people to destroy themselves and what's around them," said Logan, who has been vigorously campaigning for clemency. "Tookie is seen in this community as a victim of the system, and now it can be argued he has turned his life around. That is the human experience. Everybody, in their own way, goes through that process of redemption. That's why the people can relate to him."

Badili said he understands how people, especially relatives of the victims Williams was convicted of killing, would want revenge.

"I feel empathy for the family members because I know what it feels like to have a loved one taken from you," he said. "But if we put Tookie to death, it would be saying to people that, no matter how good you become in prison, it doesn't matter. You are still going to die."

I had so many questions and knew my time with him was limited. I told him I had recently listened to a debate about his case on National Public Radio (NPR) and felt very disturbed when his defender had to admit that he was not willing to apologise or express remorse for the murders for which he was convicted and condemned to death. I asked him why? He answered in a calm and measured voice "I am innocent, I did not commit the crimes for which I was sentenced to death, I cannot ask for forgiveness and express remorse for a murder I didn't commit, even if by refusing to do so, I risk losing my life. I cannot lie in order to live." He looked me straight in the eyes, and said: "First and foremost, I am innocent. There was no tangible evidence that linked me to the crime -- all evidence was circumstantial hearsay from a discredited informant, a bloody foot print, an indentation from an army boot, the indentation did not match my boots, no finger print that matched mine. At first the ballistic expert declared that the shell didn't match my shotgun. The prosecutor, Robert Martin, told him to try again. This time the ballistic expert said it "was similar," but at the hearing he said it was the same.

They didn't use photomicrography to examine the shells. 'My lawyers are asking to have the shells examined with photomicrograph, to establish what the human eye cannot distinguish' ". I had a sip of water, and asked him why he thought he was convicted and sentenced to death for a crime he didn't commit. "I had a nasty reputation and my reputation was put on trial. I had co-founded the street gang the Crips and had earned a bad reputation for being violent and beating up people. I was tried convicted and sentenced to death by an all white jury -- the prosecutor, Robert Martin, dismissed three prospective black jurors, because he was seeking an all white jury. He is notorious for engaging in racial discrimination. In addition, I had incompetent legal counsel."

He took a sip of his drink and went on to say in a lower voice, "I have apologised on many occasions for my crimes and I genuinely have tried to redeem myself."
 
 
Cry me a river.
He killed 4 people and was responsible for founding a gang that promotes killing. The largest cause of death for young black males between the ages of 8-16 is gang related violence.

Give me the needle, i'll stick it in him personally.
 
 
Re: Clemency for Tookie?

 
I support clemency mainly because I oppose the death penalty.
 

Well that's the deal with most of the people that want clemency for Tookie. They just don't like the death penalty period, regardless of if he did it or not.
 
 
 the forensic evidence is certainly questionable and tainted and infuriating  (4) The prosecution's gun examiner made no effort to compare ejector and extractor marks on the crime scene shell with the test shells, did notidentify the markings on the shells by class, sub-class and individual characteristics, did not take photomicrographs of the shells as has been bestpractice since the 1920's, and did not have a second examiner verify his findings. (See Declaration of David Lamagna, attached as Ex. 10) This was the only physical evidence against Stanley Williams."
 
 
He has attorneys, they have an appeal process-he lost he dies.
 
 
 
 
ralpheb, the evidence in this case is a joke. This man was framed. The Govorner should see that easy enough. No doubt he will see the frame-up since when reading it it comes right up and slaps you in the face. So if Arnold allows this execution to go forward he will have killed for selfish reasons.
 
 
and nobody in prison is guilty. If he was framed as you say he was then his lawyer should have been able to find the evidence to prove it. He didn't. he's guilty. end of story.
 
 
ralph, this story wont end because you declare it. The evidence I posted on this site points more towards Garrett, the witness, than it does to Tookie. The prosecution's forensic expert didn't even conduct proper testing. But you dont seem to care about obviously tainted evidence and witnesses that had a lot to gain by railroading Williams. The shotgun was found under the bed of the main witness and "The Browning shotgun shell was sold at only two local stores, one of which, a Big Five, had been robbed of guns and ammunition by Mr. Garrett the year before."
 
 
Again. He has had numerous appeals to over turn the conviction. His lawyer had numerous attempts to prove that the evidence was invalid. His lawyer during the trial had several times to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that somebody other than "tookie" commited the murders. He didn't accomplish that task. Nor have his current lawyers been able to introduce new evidence that "tookie" did not commit the murders or that some one else did.
So why is there such a cry over poor tookie?
Unless there is evidence where the court will overturn his conviction he's guilty ergo he dies. You will not find sympathy from me for a murder. I will not hold up a banner that says don't kill poor tookie. You will not see me holding up a banner that says die tookie die. But you will notice that until the evidence can prove that he did not do it(ie a person who realy did kill those people stepping up and saying "yep I did it) then I say he should die.
And, I could care less about a "guest columnist" I have little to no use for mass media especially newspapers.
"give me a picture and I'll write a story" Randolph Hearst
 
 
Whether or not he was guilty of the crimes as charged seems to be open to some question. The main rationale behind an executive clemency order, however, is that his is a pretty clear case of successful rehabilitation. While in prison, he has written children's books urging kids to renounce violence and gangs. He has been an outspoken advocate of early intervention for youths who are starting lead a gang life. Nobody seems to doubt his sincerity in these endeavors.

Now, before anyone says, "What about the people he [allegedly] killed?" let me ask you, will his death bring them back? Do we demonstrate that killing is wrong by killing someone? I have mixed feelings abut capital punishment myself; I'm not always sure that it isn't justified in some cases. But in this case, where there seems to be some element of doubt about his guilt (no matter how small a doubt) and given his sterling prison record, I believe that his execution would be an undoubted miscarriage of justice.
 
 
He had choices that he could have made earlier in life. If he was so concerned about people he shouldn't have started a gang. I could care less if he lives or dies. But, can you tell me what justice is served by him not fulfilling the sentence that was handed out. All things considered, it seems to me his just a coward afraid of dying and is hoping for some feable excuse to be allowed to live a miserable existance.
Unlike you I don't have mixed emotions about capital punishment. The only problem I have with it is the way that it is not even;y distibuted in a timely manner and that we have become to soft. We can't execute people in certain ways because its inhumane. These people do not show humanity when they rape, beat torture and kill people.
There, I'm off my soap box and that's my view of life. (ya otta be glad my wife isn't on here. She's more brutal than I am.)
 
 
I err on the side of mercy and life. Tookie deserves mercy for the same reasons that Karla Fay Tucker did.

 
I could care less if he lives or dies.
 

That is really sad that anyone would have such disregard for human life. I assume that you support the reproductive rights of women.
 
 
The decision has been made:  Click here to see Snoods announcement 

Now let's get past the sentence and think about the resulting public safety issues.

 source  Williams' supporters also made another pitch directly to the governor Sunday to spare his life, telling Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in a letter that they had a new witness who could help prove Williams' innocence.

"All we need now is time to investigate to make sure this story is real," said NAACP California President Alice Huffman. "We're hoping and praying for clemency, but we're not going to leave any stone unturned."
 
 
Rox, if you are asking if I support abortion? This is not the thread for that discussion.
I itp my hat to arnie for not buckling under the NAACP and social pressure. I seriously doubted that he would.
Once again, they had how many years to try and prove that he was innocent?
 
 
I'm against capital punishment. It's barbaric for the state to plan the kill a citizen--I don't care what he may have done. Prison without parole. The fact that it costs money to keep a guy in prison is hardly a reason to kill him. It would make as much sense to kill welfare recipients.

I might find the argument for capital punishment more compelling if I didn't sense a blood-thirsty theme from so many of its advocates. As in, "I'd like to stick the needle in myself." That ain't justice, that's vengeance...
 
 
I don't really have strong feeling either for or against the death penalty. If people want to lock up a criminal for life (without parole) that is fine with me. IMO, it is money well spent to keep killers and rapists off of the street. However I don't really have a problem with the death penalty either. If the evidence proves beyond a reasonable doubt and the crime was heinous (rapes, murders, pedophilia) I wouldn't lose any sleep over the state taking their life.

I don't really understand this "it isn't justice... it's vengance" arguement, though. Couldn't it be both? Justice in the states eyes and vengance in the victims eyes. Whats the problem with that?
 
 
People can think of it how they want, of course. But I don't think the state should be motivated by vengeance.

And the fact that some states (take Texas, please) seem to run capital-punishment mills, and others hardly (or never) do it at all suggests that something's amiss, no?
 
 
Why do you say the state is motivated by vengance? Why isn't it justice?

 
And the fact that some states (take Texas, please) seem to run capital-punishment mills, and others hardly (or never) do it at all suggests that something's amiss, no?
 

Not at all. Some states and the people in those states are going to be more inclined to use the death penalty than others. That would suggest to me that state laws and regulations are working like they should.

People can think of it how they want, of course. But I don't think the state should be motivated by vengeance.
 

How about being motivated by a desire to completely eliminate a member of society who committed especially brutal murders? What about being motivated by a desire to tell potential future murders that this might be their fate? Those are practical considerations.

 
And the fact that some states (take Texas, please) seem to run capital-punishment mills, and others hardly (or never) do it at all suggests that something's amiss, no?
 

It might require study, but it isn't clear that it implies that Texas is doing the wrong thing.

 Misplaced Sympathy for Killers 

Stanley "Tookie" Williams is scheduled to die by lethal injection in California's San Quentin prison next Tuesday. His death will occur nearly 27 years after he brutally murdered Albert Owens, a 7-Eleven clerk in Whittier, Calif., and three members of the Yang family -- Yen-I Yang, Tsai-Shai Yang, and their daughter, Yee-Chen Lin -- at the Brookhaven Motel in Los Angeles.

Unlike the peaceful, painless demise awaiting Williams, the deaths of his victims were horrific: He shot each of them at close range with a 12-gauge shotgun, shattering their bodies so that they died in agony. Their suffering amused him. "You should have heard the way he sounded when I shot him," Williams bragged after killing Albert Owens. According to the district attorney's summary of the evidence, "Williams then made gurgling or growling noises and laughed hysterically about Owens's death."

As cofounder of the deadly Crips street gang in 1971, Williams's criminal legacy goes well beyond the four murders for which he was convicted. The gang violence he unleashed 34 years ago has destroyed thousands of lives and left countless other victims scarred by rape, assault, and armed robbery. Though he now claims to have reformed and has written books with an antigang message, he has never admitted his guilt or expressed any remorse for the slaughter of Albert Owens and the Yang family. If his supposed contrition amounts to anything more than lip service, he has yet to prove it. Williams adamantly refuses to be debriefed by police about the Crips and their operations or to provide any information that could help bring other killers to justice. In fact, officials at San Quentin have said he continues to orchestrate gang activity from behind bars.

But of course he didn't do it. Every one in jail is innocent. We should trust this website to be objective.
 
 
D'artagnan- nothing is amiss. some of us just get tired of people who are will to take the lives of other people amd do it with so little regard, and then when its their turn, they statrt whinning and sniveling. Does the phrase "don't do the crime if you can't do the time" ring a bell. We are made up of free will and freedom to choose and act. When a person commits a violent crime the warrants and deserves the death penalty (read four shotgun murders) then they deserve to forfeit their life. Prisons are filled with people who "found Jesus" or "repent my sinful past" or "have written books against gangs." Tough! If they made those decisions before hand they would not have committed the crimes.
It is time, as they say, for these people to pay the piper.
Oh, just so you know, it is not about revenge or blood lust as you may believe. It is about the payment for the crime.
 
 
The 9th Circus just said Tookie is toast:  Court rejects appeal before Calif. execution  - every court that has considered the matter has found the evidence sufficient to uphold the sentence. The wires now are saying The Governator's tender mercies have not been swayed either, it seems Tookie is to be terminated.
 
 
alas alas, what shall Arnold do?
 
 
Arnold said Tookie's going to die.....looks like it's going forward.
 
 
yes Arnold yes Tookie to be terminated, I hope he has the guard lined up and armed. Frankly I don't give a damn about Tookie but this is really stupid.
 
 
Even Arnold can see the forensics in this case are extremely tainted.
 
 
Look for rioting(looting) in the neighborhoods where the stores which sell finer goods are located. Thugs never miss an opportunity like this to get that widescreen.
 
 
liquor stores first, single malt scotch is safe on the shelves.
 
 
Could be murders too, Jesse Jackson's out here now...if anyone gets between he and the TV camera, ouch.

Forensic testing that has been used for years was not even applied in this case. The forensic "expert" changed his story. We may very well execute a man and then prove his innocence. And I guess that would be quite alright by many Americans.

No surprise. Asta la vista Arnold.
 
 
Blueflame, to the best of my knowledge (which admitedly is imperfect), never have genetic forensics ever indicated an innocent has been executed. Not to say the execution of innocents have not occurred, of course, just that genetic forensics have not shown an innocent ever has been executed.
 
 
timberland, once there was no wheel. In this case the forensics expert changed his findings and didn't even use standard testing procedures. Very suspect.
 
 
I have really mixed feelings about the message that executing Tookie gives to the prison population.

I can't speak to whether he is innocent, or guilty. That issue has been tried, retried, appealed, etc. I don't know enough, nor do I think I could learn enough to make any better decision than has already been made. All those things have been rehashed by people who have studied it for years. I distrust last minute proof positive that he was framed, or that the evidence was skewed, etc. Where was it before the last few months. I have to believe that the appeal process has been used in every way it is possible. If new evidence, or improper conduct had been an issue, it would have been discovered long before now.

I'm satisfied he is guilty.

What I do have trouble with is the message to the prison population. If there is no clemency and no mercy, why improve? There is no reason to rehab or change, so why do so. Why not run the gang from inside the prison? Why not do whatever you can to get money, power, sell and/or use drugs, ad infinitum.

I know the next question is "what about justice for the victim? Their family?" Where's the punishment. Somehow I think life in prison is a far more horrible penalty than death. Death is escape from prison, escape from further penalty.

Like I say, I have really mixed feelings. It seems there is no real "correct" action here. I'm glad I don't have to be the Guv and decide the issue.

As most of the people on this site already know MM, his victims cannot be brought back to life. Your willingness to volunteer to throw the switch speaks volumes about you. It takes a special kind of person to want to do such a thing. If you really mean it, you're as much of a murderer in your heart as he is.

Unfortuantely, if you are responding to my post though, you have missed the point, as usual.

I'm not sure I understand that. Are you telling me that if he admits he's guily, he gets a pass on his execution?
 
 
yes
 
 
""After studying the evidence, searching the history, listening to the arguments and wrestling with the profound consequences, I could find no justification for granting clemency," Mr Schwarzenegger said.

"Stanley Williams insists he is innocent, and that he will not and should not apologise or otherwise atone for the murders of the four victims in this case. Without apology and atonement for these senseless and brutal killings, there can be no redemption," he said. "
 
 
Arnie is a strange animal in Ca. He's a republican actor. I thought all actors in hollywood were democrats.
 
 
It does seem that if Tookie confessed he would be granted clemency. It says a great deal about him that he refuses to confess. The forensics in this case are clearly questionable. And the same can be said for many such cases. That issue is bigger than Tookie and bigger than this case. Legal experts have been battling about this for a long while. Better testing is available now. But the expert in this case did not even conduct standard tests that have been used for many decades. Anyway here's some info on the legal wars over forensics. I dont expect any Bushie types to be the least bit interested though. "A CHALLENGE TO THE ADMISSIBILITY OF FIREARMS AND TOOLMARK IDENTIFICATIONS: AMICUS BRIEF PREPARED ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT IN UNITED STATES V. KAIN, CRIM. NO. 03-573-1 (E.D. PA. 2004) [1]"

INTRODUCTION

The following amicus brief was prepared in connection with a Daubert challenge in federal court to the admission of a firearms and toolmark examiner's testimony that cuts in a fence and grate were made by the defendant's bolt cutters, to the exclusion of all other bolt cutters in the world. Before the brief could be filed with the court, the government offered the defendant a plea bargain that was too good to refuse.

The expert testimony in this case was typical of that offered by firearms and toolmark examiners. The goal of the forensic science discipline of firearms and toolmark identification is to identity particular tools, such as a bolt cutter or the barrel of a particular gun, as the unique source of marks on crime scene evidence, such as a fence or a fired bullet.[2] Although numerous convictions are based on this type of testimony[3], courts have yet to recognize that adequate statistical and empirical foundations have not been developed for these identifications. The following brief explains the systemic scientific problems that should make firearms and toolmark identifications inadmissible in court.[4]  http://www.psljournal.com/archives/all/kain.cfm

The bloodlust is unbelievable! You refer ro getting executed as 15 minutes of fame?
 
 
Call it as you may. His whining and sniveling about dying have propelled him into the media spot light. How much did he care about his victims when he shot them with a shotgun and later commented about the sounds they made as they were dying. I show as much compassion for him as he showed and continues to show for his victims. NONE.
Where are the concerns from you bleeding hearts about his victims. I'm sure the families realy like the way the people are coming around to tookies defense and ignoring the basics. He has been alive since 1971 when he killed those four people. But you don't seem to care about them do you?
 
 
as much compassion as he had for victims? doesn't that bring you down a level? shouldn't you show more compassion?
how is his death going to bring them back? will vengeance appease the grieving hearts of the families? hardly. will that deter other criminals? no, research shows that adequately.
15 minutes of fame... i bet that's his priority right now. i would think of nothing else facing imminent death.
 
 
 
he says he's innocent (why would he do that if admission of guilt would save his life)
its lethal injection
 

Because if he's guilty he spends the rest of his life as nothing more than a locked up murderous gang banging thug that nobdy ever remembers. Innocent he gets to become a martyr.
 
 
He will only be a martyr for the stupid people that joined his assanine belief system the gangs are important.

Dag, murders will never see compassion on my face. EVER
And I hope that by him facing his immenant death that he begs and cries for mercy. and I hope he receives the same mercy from Gdd that tookie showed for his victims.
Will his death appease his victims families. No. I think they would finally get closure knowing that the murderous bastard that took their familiy members will draw breath no more.
I can care less if it deters criminals. There is NOTHING in society that deters criminal. They will always be.
So, using your logic, lets not even arrest criminals because it doesn't deter future criminals.
hmmmmmmmmmmm nope don't work for me.
 
 
Tookie, from what I've read, is a whole lot calmer than the folks protesting. He has made his peace with his god, and is resigned to accept his fate.

Dollars to doughnuts the LAPD is dusting off the riot gear about now...
 
 
 
 
I will 100% support Clemency,AFTER the people he killed are brought back to life.

When he can "unkill" the people he butchered,then he can live.
Till then,I vollunteer to throw the switch on the electric chair.
 

As most of the people on this site already know MM, his victims cannot be brought back to life. Your willingness to volunteer to throw the switch speaks volumes about you. It takes a special kind of person to want to do such a thing. If you really mean it, you're as much of a murderer in your heart as he is.

Unfortuantely, if you are responding to my post though, you have missed the point, as usual.
 

I was not responding to your comment,because I didnt read it.
Since his victims cannot be brought back,then why should this animal be allowed to live?

Special kind of person?
I guess so,I believe in justice.

You lose.
While I am opposed to abortion,you can do what you want with your body.I dont care.

But,when a man murders kills people the way he did then laughs about it,he does not deserve to live.

Now,since you lost your bet,take your abortion crap to another thread.
 
 
Supreme Court has now denied clemency. Tookie's going bye-bye.
 
 
The case against Williams was based on the testimony of eyewitnesses, including but not limited to accomplices, a broad assortment of physical evidence including but not limited to the firearm purported to have been the weapon in all 4 murders, and a number of self-implicating statements on the part of Williams himself, both in court under oath and otherwise, among other things. Williams excersized every avenue of appeal available under law, with the verdict of guilty and the sentence of death being found fully warranted and without contraindication in each and every circumstance.

Contrary to the assertions of some who champion clemency for Williams, James Garret, who's testimony was highly instrumental in the matter of establishing Williams as the murderer, was not an accomplice, faced no related charges, was not a "jailhouse informant", and in fact had no connection whatsoever with the Williams case beyond the facts Williams often stayed at Garret's residence, kept his shotgun there, and shared with Garret details of the murders and murder scenes that could not have been known by anyone not present at the scenes and times of the murders. Garret was facing unrelated fraud and stolen property charges at the time of his testimony, however, no deal was offered or effected relating to those charges and Garret's testimony in Williams' murder case. Williams further, according to Garret, and as corroborated by yet another witness not under charge in respect to the murders for which Willliams was found guilty, testified that Williams while discussing plans for yet another robbery said he had used his shotgun to "blow away a white guy" during a previous store robbery.

Garret's wife, Esther Garret, also uncharged in the Williams murders was at the time under no criminal charges whatsoever. Mrs. Garret corroborated much of her husband's testimony and provided additional detail concerning statements and admissions made to her or in her presence by Williams, testimony further corroborated by yet other testimony from other witnesses. Mrs. Garret did not have an unblemished criminal history; there had been a string of minor runins, none involving violent crime or anything threatening severe sentencing; however, as that was irrelevant one way or the other, there was no mention of that to the jury.

An accomplice, Alfred Coward, did provide chillingly detailed testimony pertaining to the murders, from an eyewitness perspective. Coward was granted immunity from prosecution pursuant to the Williams matter, but received no compensatory or other special consideration pertaining to his considerable other legal entanglements. The jury was told of the immunity deal, but not of Cowards numerous other then-current and pending criminal prosecutions.

The firearms examiner did not testify that Williams' shotgun had been the murder weapon, but rather that the murders had been committed with a weapon "not inconsistent with" a weapon of the caliber, make, and specific model of the shotgun siezed from Williams and conclusively proved, via official firearms sale and transfer documentation, to have been purchased by Williams. Ammunition from the same production lot as that of the spent casing recovered from one murder scene also was siezed with the shotgun. No other murder or other criminal investigation contemporary with the Williams murders investigations implicated a firearm of that specific type, nor was there any open theft report involving the theft of a weapon of that type. Only a weapon of that specific type could have produced the markings found on the recovered casing, with or without particular characteristics linking to any one specific weapon of the type.

The evidence and the trial proceedures relevant to Williams' conviction and sentencing have withstood every legal challenge presented.

 
PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND APPELLATE REVIEW

To date, Stanley Williams' case has received extensive legal scrutiny in both state and federal court. Since his conviction in 1981, Williams has pursued multiple appeals and habeas corpus petitions. In each and every instance, in both state and federal court, his conviction has been affirmed as appropriate and just.

Â• On April 18, 1980, the trial court granted Williams' motion to substitute his hand-picked attorney, Joseph Ingber, as attorney of record in place of Gerald Lenoir.

Â• On January 21, 1981, the jury trial commenced and on March 13, 1981, the jury returned guilty verdicts of four counts of first degree murder and two counts of robbery. The jury also found the special circumstance allegations of robbery-murder and multiple murder to be true. Lastly, the jury found true the special allegations that defendant Williams personally used a shotgun and that a principal was armed with a firearm.

Â• On March 17, 1981, both parties having rested without presenting evidence at the penalty phase, argument was presented on behalf of the People and defendant Williams as to whether the penalty should be death or life imprisonment without possibility of parole. Following arguments and instructions of law by the Court on this issue, the jury, on March 18, 1981, returned a verdict of death as to each of the charged first-degree murders.

Â• On April 15, 1981, defendant Williams' motions for a new trial and for modification of the verdict and findings imposing the death penalty were heard by the Court and denied. The trial court then sentenced Williams to death on counts 1, 2, 3 and 7.

Â• On April 11, 1988, on automatic appeal to the California Supreme Court, in the cases of People v. Stanley Williams, Crim. No. 21977, and In re Stanley Williams, Crim. No. 23806, consolidated under Case No. S004365, and published at (1988) 44 Cal.3d 1127, the imposition of the death penalty was affirmed and defendant Williams' first habeas petition was denied following an evidentiary hearing.

Â• On January 18, 1989, the California Supreme Court denied defendant Williams' second state habeas petition in Case No. S008526.

Â• On that same date, January 18, 1988, defendant Williams filed his first federal habeas petition in the United States District Court in Case No. CV89-00327SVW. The district court held that petition in abeyance while defendant Williams returned to the California Supreme Court with his unexhausted claims.

Â• On April 11, 1994, following another evidentiary hearing, the California Supreme Court denied defendant Williams' third state habeas petition in Case No. S011868, published at (1994) 7 Cal.4th 572.

Â• On June 21, 1995, the California Supreme Court denied defendant Williams' fourth state habeas petition in Case No. S039285.

Â• On December 21, 1988, defendant Williams returned to federal court and, following an evidentiary hearing, the United States District Court denied defendant Williams' amended habeas petition in Case No. CV89-00327-SVW, and published its order at (1998) 41 F.Supp.2d 1043.

Â• On December 17, 1999, defendant Williams' subsequent Rule 60(b) motion to reopen the judgment was denied, and the order was published at (1999) 1999 WL 1320903.

Â• On September 10, 2002, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit denied defendant Williams' direct appeal and Rule 6 (b) motion in Case Nos. 99-99018 and 00-99001, published at (2002)306 F.3d 665.

Â• On September 9, 2004, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals amended the opinion and denied defendant Williams' petition for rehearing and suggestion for rehearing en banc, published at (2004) 384 F.3d 567.

Â• On February 2, 2005, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied defendant Williams' subsequent petition for rehearing and suggestion for rehearing en banc, published at (2005) 396 F.3d 1059.

Â• Finally, on October 11, 2005, the United States Supreme Court denied defendant Williams' petition for writ of certiorari in Case No. 04-10500.

As this historical accounting proves, Williams has benefited from a detailed and exhaustive review of all of his legal claims and each court has affirmed the guilty verdicts and affirmed the death sentence. In doing so, our courts, both state and federal, have given appropriate and serious consideration to Williams, consideration which Williams so violently denied each of his victims.

Whatever Williams may have done before he committed those murders, whatever he may have done following his commission of those murders, is wholly immaterial and irrelevant; Williams committed, was arrested in connection and was charged with, was tried on, found guilty of, and sentenced for those murders. In a few hours, Williams' will pay with his life for those murders - payment far, far short of satisfying the arrears but the best that can be managed in any event. It will have to do.
 
 
We've shot ourselves in the foot again. Tookie would never be out in the world to do harm, but he could have done a lot of good while in prison.
I guess Swartzie wants to look strong.
 
 
"why should this animal be allowed to live?" because we, just like him, were not endowed with a right to take someone else's life. if we do, what does that make us? if you kill in vengeance, do you kill a little less?
for these and many other reasons most developed countries in the world banned the death penalty.
 
 
 
Since his victims cannot be brought back,then why should this animal be allowed to live?
 

For a lifetime of punishment. How is death punishment? Death is a reprieve, not a punishment.

 
Special kind of person?
I guess so,I believe in justice.
 

Anyone with such a thirst to kill as you have demonstrated, is just another Tookie Williams that hasn't happened yet.
 
 
I'm not all that in much in favorof the death penalty as a general concept, BTW. However, it is the law, and the execution of Williams cannot in any way be considered a miscarriage of justice. If anyone meritted the death penalty, it would be Williams; every qualfcation is met. Yeah, I'd rather see the bastard rot behind bars and be buried without marker, but that isn't the law in this case. The ones who have shot themselves in the foot here are the ones who sought to make this a showpiece case for the anti-death penalty cause.

I'm with you! I don't consider death a penalty. I'd rather see the bastard live forever. If it were up to me though, prison for Tookie Williams wouldn't be as comfortable as it is. I don't mean cruel and unusal treatment, but he would be working in very uncomfortable surroundings, doing some extremely hard time!

In theory at least I've got nothing against hanging somebody like Manson or Dennis Rader. Here's the problem: I'd want at least two or three changes to the system before I could feel good about capital punishment anymore.

1. The criterion of guilt should be "beyond any doubt, whatsoever". "Beyond a reasonable doubt" doesn't cut it for capital punishment; you can't unhang somebody.

2. The person in question would have to represent a continuing danger should he ever get loose again. That would seem to eliminate Tookie. It would certainly not eliminate Manson, Rader, or Paul Bernardo as candidates.

3. I'd want to get rid of the present adversarial system of justice and replace it with some sort of inquisitorial system in which the common incentive for all parties was to discover the truth of the matter.

The biggest problem would be finding some sort of an ironclad and foolproof set of criteria for determmmining "guilt beyond any doubt whatsoever". You'd get judges and prosecutors wanting to tell you somebody like Sarah Johnson in Idaho was guilty beyond any and all doubt, while that is simply less than obvious to all observers.

They expected DNA testing to eliminate the prime suspect in felony cases in something like one or two percent of cases and many people were in states of shock when that number came back more like 33 or 35%. That translates into some fabulous number of people sitting around in prisons for stuff they don't know anything at all about since the prime suspect in a felony case usually goes to prison. Moreover, in a state like Texas which executes a hundred people a year or whatever it is, that translates into innocent people being executed on a fairly regular basis.

It's not at all obvious to me that Tookie satisfies either one of the two essential conditions I'd require for executing somebody, i.e. guilty beyond any doubt whatsoever and a continuing danger. Executing him is a mistake.
 
 
Good points, Gunga.

I agree.
 
 
Some good points there - but I don't agree there is any doubt concerning Williams' culpability or sentence - both were determined and repeatedly have been confirmed under law.

Pretty much moot points in the current instance; The Supremes have just sung, and the song was "That's it for Tookie". Barring a major earthquake at San Quentin, Tookie takes the big ride soon after midnight hits California.
 
 
Having just watched the execution "live" I feel sick.
 
 
 
Some good points there - but I don't agree there is any doubt concerning Williams' culpability or sentence - both were determined and repeatedly have been confirmed under law.

 

I'd figure there was about one chance in a couple million Tookie was innocent. Nonetheless the whole case against him seems to arise from the testimony of other criminals and people married to other criminals. Examples of cases in which I feel the criteria of guilty beyond any doubt whatsoever was met would be Manson, Rader, Son-of-Sam, Paul Bernardo, and cases of that sort. Tookie doesn't quite qualify.

Likewise with the other criteria of continuing danger. Manson and any of the serial killers qualify and guys who go on ordering crimes on the outside from inside prison cells qualify, but it's far from obvious that Tookie did.

The death penalty to me should be a last resort in cases in which there's no other real way for society to totally protect itself.
 
 
 
I'd figure there was about one chance in a couple million Tookie was innocent.
 
Yeah but they flipped the coin and he lost, I dont see what your point is. Guilt or innocence has nothing to do with the American legal system as far as I can see.

It is astonishing to see how little regard the right-wingers here have for the loss of human life. It is also very revealing.
 
 
Maybe Tookie should have been concerned for the loss of human life 26 years ago, then maybe he would not have found himself in the position he was in.

Even though I would like to see the death penalty eliminated, I have no sympathy whatsoever for those who face the death penalty. They face this penalty of their own accord. If they do not desire to be put to death, then they need only keep from committing crimes that have the death penalty as punishment. His sentence should have been carried out many years ago.
 
 
not really. They forgive the sinner while blaming the sin. Pretty simple logic also stupid. "I forgive your sinning tookie, and now I must kill you."
 
 
What is astonishing to see is how wrong the left-wingers are about this case. Tookie was a bad man... period. I would have had no problem locking him up for life, but pretending this guy is a good guy that could do good things from jail is completely delusional.

How so? Do you really find it astonishing that "right-wingers" believe in America's system of justice and the application of our laws? The guilty are punished. Seems simple enough. Maybe you are trying to read more into it than that though.

This goes far beyond right and left Roxx. You don't get any farther left than I do, but I wasn't opposed to his being put to death. I wanted him to live so that he could spend the rest of his life in prison. As I told Timber, I don't consider death a punishment, I consider it a release.

I AM concerned that putting him to death discourages good behavior from the inmates. If I know there is no redemption whatsoever, what reason do I have to behave???
 
 
Should good behavior exzempt you from the punishment you deserve? He was to die in prison. If he or anyone is concerned about good behavior, they should be doing that BEFORE the think about killing people. "good beahvior" is a ploy used by every inmate as a way of screwing over the system.
Niether my thoughts nor my prayers go out to a killer who is executed. I save them for the truely deserving.

Spoken like a true conservative nutjob...probably speak of sanctity of life when discussing abortion yet shriek "let 'er fly" when it's time to bring the axe down on a convicted (and seemingly reformed) criminal.
If "good behavior is a ploy used by every inmate to screw over the system", then you would agree that no one is capable of reform no?
 
 
Candidone1, he could turn around your little example and wonder why you are concerned with the life of a convicted killer but are all for killing unborn children.

Since that bit of hypocrisy cuts both ways, it may be best to use other arguments in arguing for the end of the death penalty.
 
 
Not one person here will ever know my true heart felt feelings on abortion. That is a discussion I save for the one person I admire and respect-my wife. The abortion issue is not at play here. What is being discussed and the only thing that should be discussed is the view of capital punishment. All people in the Unisted States are fully aware that if they take a life, there is a chance that they will lose theirs in turn. If people are so willing to still commit violent acts of murder, then they are accepting the fact that they too shall deserve to die and should be put to death. I can care less if a person who is sentenced to death or is sentenced to life in prison with out hope of parole, or is senteced to a term that will more than lekely exceed their life span reforms themselves. My concern about reform are for those people serving the short sentences who may be back on the street.
As far as being conservative, I have been called both conservative and liberal. It all depends on the issue.
As far as being a nut job???? well, my shrink says i'm normal.
What's your excuse?

Not so, Ralph. There are quite a few states which do not have capital punishment as part of their criminal code. (Last time I looked, I think it was 27 states, but I could be off on that figure.) The intersting thing is that many of those states which do not execute prisoners have lower per capita murder rates than do states e.g. Texas, California and Florida. Statistically, at least, it seems fairly obvious that the death penalty is no way a deterrent to murder.
 
 
Yeah, but it does feel SO good for the blood-thirsty and vindictive.
 
 
Just for gigglers, anybody wanna dig up the details on "All the good Tookie did while he was in prison"? Seems he refused to cooperate with the system just about any way he could, down to and including assaulting guards and other prisoners, withholding information relevant to criminal activity both in the prison and outside, was active within the gang structure in the prison, and plotted more than one escape attempt. The children's books he purportedly "authored" have had somewhat less market success - and influence - than some would like others to think was the case, BTW a few hundred copies sold prior to his latest 15 minutes of notoriety (now, though, I'm sure sales will spike momentarilly - collectors' items, you know). This was one bad dude, with little or no indication of getting "better" beyond his own claim that he was doing so and its echoing by his supporters. Tookie's "rehabilitation" is a myth.

Sure, there's a lot to be said against the death penalty, but there sure isn't much to be said for letting someone like Tookie escape it once he'd earned it.
 
 
Of course it's great to be blood thirsty.
Now, statistically speaking the states that have the highest murder rates per capita (texas, California, Florida, Pennsylvania and New York) also have one other thing in common. They are the largest states population wise, they have the largest cities and they have the highest rates of people living under the poverty level.
Do not ever confuse the lack of a death penalty with a correlation on crime, when you are not figuring into the equation other factors such as income, race and other factors. To do so leads to a misrepresentation of the overall statistics.
Oh, don't forget that Washington D.C. does not have the death penalty but is the murder capital.

I heard someone state today that what they should do is add an extra page to the back of all of his books which would hold the text:

Due to the crimes in which Tookie was convicted, he was put to death by lethal injection on 12/13/05.

That might have some effect on the kids that read his books.

Like I say, the long odds are that Tookie was guilty as hell but I wouldn't want to have to stake my life on it the way anybody would in the case of Manson or Rader. There was no rational reason for him to go on claiming innocence if he was guilty. If it SHOULD turn out that this guy was innocent, that will probably be the end of the death penalty in America.
 
 
"No fingerprints, blood or clothing at either crime scene connected Williams to the shootings. The main physical evidence against him was a shell casing at the motel, matched to Williams' shotgun by a sheriff's expert whose testing methods have been derided as "junk science'' by an expert hired by Williams' current lawyers. Last week, the state Supreme Court rejected a defense request for new tests of the gun."  http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/12/07/MNG60G468I1.DTL 
 
 
Ahnold should have released him. Tookie would have died quicker.

Unless the guy really had lost touch with reality I can't think of a reason for him to have gone on claiming innocence if he was guilty. I know this comes as a huge shock to a lot of judges and prosecutors, but every once in a while, when somebody refuses to admit guilt for something, it's because they didn't do it.
 
 
While I'm opposed to the death penalty, while it is used, I strongly believe that it should only be used where there is a plethora of evidence of the person's guilt. It doesn't sound like this is the case in this instance. Though that probably doesn't matter to the more bloodthirsty members of the right.
 
 
I guess he's dead, now. Did anyone see if he made a final statement...or how things went at the prison?
 
 
Lash he didn't make a final statement. Some people say he may have been given clemency if he apologized and confessed. This is from the link I posted "Now that clemency is his last hope, Williams' "claim of innocence may be hurting him'' by making it impossible for him to express remorse for the four murders, said UC Berkeley Law Professor Franklin Zimring, an expert on clemency.

If that costs him his life, so be it, Williams says. He told The Chronicle in an interview Thursday, "It is absurd for a person to apologize for something he didn't do. I will not lower my integrity. It would be wrong.''

Twenty-Four, yep, countem, 24 years for something to change or come up. Tookie had gone through the process. BTW Blue, the more I read about Tookie and how he was in jail, I doubt there was much remorse for the people that died. His position of innocence was consistent, but iI doubt he was. Take a look at the article I posted for Lash.

I am sorry however that they put him to death, I think he got off easy!
 
 
"I am sorry however that they put him to death, I think he got off easy!"

Are you another "he should have been tortured to death" advocate Steviepax. (Pax?)
 
 
mysteryman, yup an expert hired by the defense. One of the leadeing forensic experts in the country who pointed out that the "expert" in this case didn't even use the standard test used since the 20s. The prosecution's expert first said he could not determine the shotgun shell came from the shotgun found under the main witnesse's bed. The prosecuter then got the expert to change his testimony. And he changed not based on any scientific testing. This is the only physical evidence in the case and it was not scientifically proved. Last week the court refused to order new tests on the shotgun and shell. Why? Because if the test proved the shell was not related to the shotgun the state was caught red handed framing an innocent man.
 
 
Everyone's innocent in God's eyes, but not mine.
 
 
Blue,
No matter how you spin it,he went thry the complete appeals process and EVERY court found him guilty and found no reason to overturn his conviction,or to order a retrial.

Even the highly liberal 9th circuit court refused to intervene.
You dont have to like it,but the facts are plain.
He was guilty,and got what he deserved.

As for your "expert",any trial lawyer will tell you that they can find "experts" to testify to anything,for a fee.
 
 
I saw a picture of tookie on this thread. Any of you pro tookie people willing to post pics of the four people that he killed.
Stop trying to idolize a killer be cause he was put to death.
 
 
 last week a california court refused to re-examine forensic evidence that was highly questionable. why 
 
 
Because he has been found guilty in so many ways that it was a waste of time. he was a waste of DNA.

Just to annoy you
 
 
mysteryman, you follow a mass murderer who lied us into war. So I think your interest in this case has nothing to do with justice. You dont care if it was a frameup or not.
 
 
It's all Bush's fault. If it wasn't for George, Tookie never would have killed those four people in the first place. Yup.
 
 
 
mysteryman, you follow a mass murderer who lied us into war.....
 

You know, I'm about as far from being a de-moker-rat as anybody can get and I still hate to see anybody talking about Franklin Roosevelt that way.

Actually,I think he meant Kennedy.
 
 
It was Lincoln
 
 
Sure is wasn't Clinton?
 
 
 Here are pictures of Tookie's victims. 

Perhaps you should look at them before praising St. Tookie.
 
 
McGentrix, Tookie was innocent. He was framed. The real killer got away with it. As for FDR, JFK and Clinton, they are gone. Bushie cant hide behind them. He's very much under the gun for lying us into war and his days are spent trying to convince America that he really, really didn't lie us into war. Americans are not buying that by a wide margin.
 
 
St. Tookie.
I like that. He will be the patron Saint for inmates that say they are innocent
 
 
 
"I am sorry however that they put him to death, I think he got off easy!"

Are you another "he should have been tortured to death" advocate Steviepax. (Pax?)
 

Nope! Just think life in prison would be worse than a "Get out of jail free" card. I think maybe they make life TOO easy on these people, but without having been there myself, I can't really say.
 
 
I can't imagine that being locked up all the time and being subject to brutalization by anyone bigger than me would be "easy," but I haven't been there, either...

So the entire appeal process didn't work for Tookie. Twenty-Four years and poor Tookie never got a fair chance. Is that it Blue?"

I think Tookie was quite capable of taking care of himself.
 
 
Steve, that's right. Before he was put to death new tests should have been made on the shotgun shell and shotgun as requested many times by the defense. What harm could have been done?

Twenty-Four years. I think he had his chances. All this last minute stuff as far as I'm concerned is just meant to buy time. He had enough time to prove his innocence. If they hadn't found something by now, and it took the proximity of his execution to bring it up again, I think it was just so much smokescreen.
 
 
Steve, the physical evidence was questioned many times over the years. It was far from a last minute request. The State fought and won against having a real investigation of the physical evidence. What were they scared of? Having their frame-up revealed. The original ruling by the States forensic expert was that the shell could not be proven to have come from the shotgun. He changed his story after being pressured by the prosecutor. And still never conducted any real tests. The real killer was not charged in this case.

Then why didnt ANY of the courts,in all those years,overturn the conviction on those grounds?
 
 
Posted by Timber earlier in this thread:

 
The firearms examiner did not testify that Williams' shotgun had been the murder weapon, but rather that the murders had been committed with a weapon "not inconsistent with" a weapon of the caliber, make, and specific model of the shotgun siezed from Williams and conclusively proved, via official firearms sale and transfer documentation, to have been purchased by Williams. Ammunition from the same production lot as that of the spent casing recovered from one murder scene also was siezed with the shotgun. No other murder or other criminal investigation contemporary with the Williams murders investigations implicated a firearm of that specific type, nor was there any open theft report involving the theft of a weapon of that type. Only a weapon of that specific type could have produced the markings found on the recovered casing, with or without particular characteristics linking to any one specific weapon of the type.
 

 LINK 

Given that, an 11th hour examination of the shotgun and shells would prove nothing.

If anyone is interested, here is a link to  L.A. DA Steve Cooley's reply to Tookie's request for clemancy  and it reviews all of the evidence against Tookie.
 
 
 
...life in prison would be worse than a "Get out of jail free" card.
 

Free in spirit but not in body.

Which reminds me of the RAF man in Stalagluft 14. His injuries necessitated amputation of a leg.

"What do you want us to do with the limb?"

Send it to my mother in England

Unfortunately we have to take off your other leg, we are sorry. Where should we send it?

to mother.

Several weeks pass

Poor man develops gangrene in an arm.

"We have to amputate.....

"To mother in England....

Suddenly guards burst into the hut and take him before the camp commander.

"WE KNOW YOUR PLAN, YOU ARE TRYING TO ESCAPE NO?"
 
 
Thanx Tico. Very interesting. I don't see how Tookie could possibly have maintained his innocence with all that evidence.
 
 
because momma, in prison, nobody is guilty. If you don't beieve me, just ask someone in prison.
 
 
ralpheb,

LOL. Yeah, that makes perfect sense. I should have thought of it myself.  
 
 
I have been to prison, and it sucks, but it's preferable to death by far. If it wasn't people wouldn't be fighting tooth and nail to avoid the death penalty.
 
 
ILZ, what is your input on tookie(I hope people notice that I don't even capatalize his name) and the events.

Killing a person for their crimes is a very serious matter - the onus is on capital punishment advocates to prove that it is warranted. I've never seen somebody make that case. Capital punishment does not act as a deterrant, it is not cheaper than life imprisonment, the entire justice system is marred by racism and classism, the chance of executing an innocent person is always present, etc. Going beyond the obvious moral question, there's just no rational reason for capital punishment.

Spoken like a truly compassionate person. You wouldn't be -- down deep, of course -- one of those "compasionate conservatives" would you?
 
 
I feel I am as compasionate for murderers as they are for their victims when they are killing them.
 
 
You would be surprised just how far left I am!! I just think we make death row way too comfortable for those who are in it. I am one of those "bleeding heart libruls" the rightwingers whine about. I just think that death row is a joke. If I had to go to jail, I'd want to make sure I was on death row. Private, quiet cells removed from the rest of the prison population. Private exercise time, TV, 3 squares a day. Excellent health care, at least in California. Yea, if I'm going to jail, I'm making sure it's serious enough to get on death row!!
 
 
 
I feel I am as compasionate for murderers as they are for their victims when they are killing them.
 

So, then, you put yourself in the same category as them? You don't think that you're better person than a murderer is?
 
 
I am in a much better catagory. I havent kiled them. I just believe that they should be killed.

Basically, I don't even care what the hell W had to do to take down the baathist regime in Iraq. It's overwhelmingly clear that Hussein and his baathist party were responsible at least for the anthrax attacks which followed 9-11 and I don't ever want to see ANYBODY get away with shit like that. I don't care if W had to put his hand on a bible and claim two and two are five to set that one straight.
 
 
I think we need to get blue a soap box.

You're a moron. Jail is a horrible place where brutality reigns supreme. People come out of jails fucked up for the rest of thier lives. Yet, you'd make it harsher. The problem with morons like you is that you don't realize these people - people like me - are going to be released one day. Do you really want a man who has ben hardened bya decade of Darwinian brutality to be released on to the streets?

Were you fired because of your record, or because you lied on your application?
 
 
Tico,

Hi! I am curious. If you put on your application that you have been convicted of a crime, they can't fire you later because of it, can they?
 
 
 
Tico,

Hi! I am curious. If you put on your application that you have been convicted of a crime, they can't fire you later because of it, can they?
 

They may not hire you because of the felony conviction. It depends on the particular state you are in. Some employers will inquire about the circumstances of the prior offense. They should only consider the felony conviction as it relates to the applicant's suitability for the particular job they are applying for, and have a sound business justification if they refuse to hire because of the conviction. Obviously, different employers approach it differently. In many cases a criminal record will not automatically disqualify you for employment. However, falsification of the application will almost always disqualify you, regardless of how well qualified you are otherwise. And all will fire the employee if they falsified their application, and the employer finds out about it later.

ILZ's experience might be different. His experience might be that he doesn't get hired if he is truthful, so he believes his best chance at employment is to falsify his application.

Either way, it would not be a good situation to be in.
 
 
Thanx Tico. I appreciate you explaining that. I think if someone is honest enough to tell the truth and if they are truly trying to be a productive member of society they should be given every chance. Once someone's sentence is served, I think they should be given every chance, just like everyone else.

Moratorium on Executions in California Proposed
Written for the web by C. Johnson, Internet News Producer

The controversy and publicity generated by the execution of Stanley Tookie Williams is focusing attention on a measure that would suspend California's death penalty law for three years.

Assembly Bill 1121 would put executions in the state on hold until January 1, 2009. The bill's authors say that would give lawmakers time to study a review of the state's death penalty procedures being undertaken by The California Commission on the Fair Administration of Justice. The commission is one year into its study, which must be completed by December 31, 2007. Legislators and criminal justice experts would have 2008 to go over the report and make recommendations, if necessary.

Unless lawmakers act on the recommendations or extend the suspension of the death penalty, the moratorium would end January 1, 2009.

With more than 100 death row convictions overturned since the 1970s because the accused were found to be innocent, the authors of "California Moratorium on Executions Act" say they fear an innocent person may be wrongly executed under current state procedures. "We can't gurantee that we don't have innocent people who have been put to death in California or will be," said AB 1121's co-author Sally Lieber, D-Mountain View.

Lieber said she wouldn't be surprised if a review of California's procedures reveal a troubled system similar to that in Illinois. In 2000, after 13 people on Illinois' death row were exonerated, Illinois Gov. George Ryan declared a moratorium on executions in his state. "There was evidence of racial bias and that situations like inadequate council in capital cases was affecting the number of cases that should be commuted," Lieber said.

Those who favor keeping California's capital punishment law in place argue death penalty cases are the mostly thoroughly reviewed of any criminal cases. "The amount of review, the Williams' case is one of them, 24 years in that case, hundreds of separate appeals. There are no cases in the country or in the world that are as closely looked at as a California death penalty case," said David LaBahn of the California District Attorneys Association.

Court challenges overturned California's death penalty law in 1967. It was reinstated in 1977. Since 1992, 12 inmates have been put to death. Two others are scheduled to be executed in January and February.

According to the state Department of Corrections, there are more than 640 men and women on death row in California.

AB 1121 is scheduled to be heard in committee next month. For the full text of AB 1121, click on the above weblink.  http://www.news10.net/storyfull2.aspx?storyid=14772 
 
 
 
Let me see. I'm a moron, and you're the one that's been in jail. That's some logic you've got going there!
 

You may be surprised to learn this, but not everyone who goes to prison is a moron.
 
 
Schwarzenegger Stadium in Austria to be renamed: report
Dec 15, 2005, 13:47 GMT

Graz - The Arnold Schwarzenegger Football Stadium in Austria's second-largest city Graz is to be renamed as a sign of displeasure with the city's most famous son, a local newspaper reported Thursday.

A majority of members on Graz City Council voted to rename the stadium after the Austrian-born governor of California approved the execution earlier this week of Stanley 'Tookie' Williams, according to Kleine Zeitung.

The Terminator-turned-governor was born six kilometres outside Graz in the community of Thal.

Representatives from the Social Democrats (SP), the Greens and the Communist Party (KP), traditionally strong in Graz, joined forces to push through the proposal, despite the objection of Mayor Siegfried Nagl of the conservative People's Party (VP).

'It's getting on our nerves that we're again and again being criticized for Schwarzenegger's actions in California,' said SP Vice Mayor Welter Ferk.

'We're not exactly basking in glory for being brought into the public limelight in connection with the death penalty. Therefore I'm in favour of renaming the stadium,' he added.
 
 
You'll forgive me if I'm not shedding tears.

My remarks were aimed more at Death Row. If you read the part I posted about the amenities of Death Row you'll get that. I don't think being sheltered off from the rest of the prison population in a private room is punishment. Access to TV, computers and internet, in the room 23 out 24 hours, 3 regular meals a day, excellent health care, time to write childrens books, etc, etc, etc.

The very nature of the kind of crime it takes to reach Death Row would dictate hard time to me. I mean truly breaking rocks, very hard time. Back breaking, ball busting hard time! That's what I'm talking about. I think Tookey should have been left alive, with a drastic change in regimen.

This sentence is atrocious. Lieber has murdered the English language. And, if the "internet news producer" is going to quote someone's words, he should attempt to quote those words correctly. The correct word is "counsel," NOT "council."
 
 
 
....excellent health care....
 

outrageous. they should be worked to death in the service of the reich.

OK Steve, I've got one for you. This is based on fact. Two people need a transplant, or die. One is Joe Lunchbucket who has worked and and been a good citizen all his life, and the other is a deathrow inmate.

Who got the transplant??

Arnold is a buffoonish womanizing ego-maniac. Naming a sports stadium after him is small potatoes in comparison to giving him control over an entire state. The star-struck people who elected him to be the governor of California ought to have their heads examined.
 
 
 
Debra, haha. Well beyond all that the really important sentence is this, Moratorium on Executions in California Proposed".
 

You find that important? That a state senator has proposed legislation? That's what they do, you know... propose legislation. A story about legislation that has been pending for months, and has not had any activity since June is not news. When they pass legislation, that's when it becomes news.

Until that point, it's just an attempt to create a news story.
 
 
I dont know but I hope it was determined solely on medical need, regardless of lifestyle factors or current place of residence.
 
 
oh let me answer cmon please let me let me I know.

It wasn't the law abiding citizen!

I bet it was the person who doesn't have to pay one cent for health care.
And, I love this, they couldn't execute him until AFTER the transplant. SOOOOOOOOOOOO not only did he do wrong in order to get the death penalty, he killed somebody else because he got the transplant when he knew he was going to be executed.

Yes, let's give the really important sentence some intelligent discussion. But, do you really think the California people (the ones who fail to provide basic elementary education to their children and elect movie stars to run their state) really care about effective assistance of council... I mean, counsel.

You must have peeked at the answer! You got it right! Right Now, California is reevaluating who does, and doesn't get transplants because of this very reason.
 
 
The non-movie starts havent done anything to improve the education of Ca either. And poor toooooooookie chose his own counsel.

Steve, you are indeed a humanitarian. I said both needed it or die. That's the medical need.
 

But its never as simple as that is it Steve? One does not die as soon as the other gets the transplant. You are not physically killing someone by postponing the operation, unless of course you both deny the patient the transplant and strike him off the waiting list. Is that what happened?

Time happened Steve, postponing his transplant did kill Joe Lunchbucket. The inmate is however, still alive.

The fault is not that the prisoner gets a kidney transplant when he needs one but rather under the primitive American healthcare system, many poor people cant afford the insurance to get themselves on the waiting list. That is the real outrage. Take your anger out on that injustice, not the prison inmate.
 
 
You are changing the subject to national health care, and avoiding the issue at hand. Frankly, if they were going to take the trouble of executing Tookie, they should have chopped him up and used his parts for those that need a transplant. Now THERE"S justice. He would have been able to give life in return for those he took.

I'm just so curious where you get your ideas and opinions about these things.

Medicare provides for anyone at any age in this country who is suffering permanent kidney failure. No one is denied a place on on the waiting list for a kidney transplant, least of all those with financial problems.
 
 
JustWonders, I'm not so sure about your statement there. Do you have a link to support it??

Steve, Just incase you think I'm the only one holding this opinion.

Stevepax, I've agreed with some of your statements so far. But, Justwonders is correct that people are placed on the donor waiting list by need and not by finacial eligeabilty(sp).
I very much agree that people who are guarenteed death in prison should not receive transplants. I know it sounds cruel and callus, it's just my belief.

I very much agree that people who are guarenteed death in prison should not receive transplants. I know it sounds cruel and callus, it's just my belief.
 

Good! I just didn't know if that was really true. I'm glad to hear that is the case.
 
 
Yeah, JW... not sure that's an accurate picture.

Matter of fact, I'm aware of a case in Illinois where an inmate is probably not on an organ waiting list, and that State does not pay for organ transplants for inmates, leaving their families or private insurance to foot the bill.

But maybe I can be shown to be wrong.... ?
 
 
There is a gentleman that I am deployed with that has a daughter on a waiting list and I was having a discussion with him. His daughter moves up as the people in front either receive a transplant or dies. Or, if her condition worsens.
I am not sure if there is still a compatibility issue with transplants or not.
I'm not a doctor and I don't play one on tv either.
 
 
I'm looking through Walters links and I'm not finding that Medicare does that. Frankly I would be surprised if they did. I'm going to keep looking.

Hmmm. Perhaps he should sue the State. A California inmate did...and won.

Thanks Ralph, I'll check them out.
 
 
Do any of you remember Dr. Death? Dr. Jack Kevorkian. He was a pioneer in "right to death" matters. He helped terminal people die. He ended up in prison for helping the terminal die.

It was his idea that we use the people on death row for spare parts. I have to agree with him, I think it's a great idea!
 
 
 
 
The fault is not that the prisoner gets a kidney transplant when he needs one but rather under the primitive American healthcare system, many poor people cant afford the insurance to get themselves on the waiting list. That is the real outrage. Take your anger out on that injustice, not the prison inmate.
 

I'm just so curious where you get your ideas and opinions about these things

"His case has set off a series of ethical issues here," said Dr. Susan Tolle, director of the Center for Ethics in Health Care at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland. "A lot of people are angry here because prisoners across the nation are provided a basic health-care package while there are poor working-class families that cannot even afford a package. Many ask, 'Why should we provide health care to a death-row inmate?' I would turn that around and ask, 'Why can't we as a society provide a health-care package for the working poor?' "
 
 
Government Publication: Medicare coverage for kidney dialysis and kidney transplant:

 http://www.medicare.gov/publications/pubs/pdf/esrdcoverage.pdf 

Medicare is a health insurance program for:

â€¢ People 65 years of age and older.

â€¢ Some people with disabilities under 65 years of age.

â€¢ People with End-Stage Renal Disease or ESRD (permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or a transplant).

Who is Eligible?

You can get Medicare Part A no matter how old you are if your kidneys no longer work and you need regular dialysis or have had a kidney transplant, and:

â€¢ You have worked the required amount of time* under Social Security, the Railroad Retirement Board, or as a government employee; or

â€¢ You are getting or are eligible for Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits; or

â€¢ You are the spouse or dependent child of a person who has worked the required amount of time* to be eligible for Medicare or who is getting Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits.
 
 
Steve, There aren't enough organs to go around. That's the real problem. That was also in my link. No matter if the health care is free, if you don't have enough organs, you're not going to give a transplant to everyone. When you come up with the organs to satisfy the need, then you've solved the problem. I'm in favor of a national health care system, but that isn't the issue.

I just came up with a way to get more organs into the system.

Health care is a serious issue, why don't you start a topic about it?
 
 
 
 
 
I have been to prison, and it sucks, but it's preferable to death by far. If it wasn't people wouldn't be fighting tooth and nail to avoid the death penalty.
 

Heh. Five minutes after I wrote this post I got a call from my new job telling me I was fired because a criminal background check exposed my record.

Go justice system!
 

Were you fired because of your record, or because you lied on your application?
 

I left the slot blank on my application. Hold on everybody - yes, I am aware that that constitutes grounds for firing. Fine. The point is that employers should not be able to ask for that kind of information in the first place. It only puts up another road block to rehabilitation.

Like I said, we make it way too comfortable for the inmates. If I were running it, they would WISH they were dead.
 

You're a moron. Jail is a horrible place where brutality reigns supreme. People come out of jails **** up for the rest of thier lives. Yet, you'd make it harsher. The problem with morons like you is that you don't realize these people - people like me - are going to be released one day. Do you really want a man who has ben hardened bya decade of Darwinian brutality to be released on to the streets?
 

Let me see. I'm a moron, and you're the one that's been in jail. That's some logic you've got going there!
 

Yes, because whether or not somone has been to jail is the litmus test for intelligence.

Awesome post.

In a perfect world, everyone would have health insurance, but I'd hardly call the system in the US "primitive". And because it's not a perfect world, I see that the NHS in England has announced that perhaps by 2008, they'll be able to cut the wait for hospital treatment to 18 weeks. Maybe. If all goes "perfectly".

Well I could Steve, but to be honest I'm not that really interested. In the UK we have national health system which works reasonably well most of the time. I suggest the US follow the same. But if you don't its not my problem. However if you start a thread, I'm sure I'll contribute, or at least heckle from the back  
 
 
ILZ, My wife works as an HR manager. I asked her about whether or not an employer can ask about criminal background questions. She said it was legal and that for her, depending on the crime, she could and would hire a person with a record. If a person leaves that area blank or puts a negative response then it becomes a falsification of the application. Again, depending on the person and the company, the company may continue to keep the employee or may terminate them.
It's interesting, because my wife just told me of a similar circumstance. A person who had been convicted of a felony came to her for employment and marked no to the felony question. It later came out that he had been and what it was for. Guy didn't stand a chance. It was for something my wife finds appauling and she had him terminated.
Whether we like it or not does not change the way that it is.
 
 
Debra, one fine day we'll abolish the death penalty.
 
 
 
The point is that employers should not be able to ask for that kind of information in the first place.
 

So,if you apply for a job in a pharmacy,I should not be able to ask if you have any kind of felony drug conviction?
Or,if you apply for a job in around children,I shouldnt be able to find out if you have a record as a sexual predator?

Or,if you apply in a bank,should I not be able to find out if you have a conviction for embezzleing money?

You are living in a dream world if you seriously believe that.
As an employer,I have a right and a duty to my customers to find out if you have any felony convictions related to whatever job or industry you are applying for.

Certain jobs should have access to certain criminal records. No pedophiles should be working at the Day Care.

I'll have to take poison after I write this!

I agree with MM on all these points.

I also think that the type of crime would make a difference. If you're a rapist, or a child molester, I'm the last one you want to apply for a job with. I wouldn't hesitate to hire an ex-con, depending on the crime committed.
 
 
ILZ, The more you write, the less compassion I have for you.

I understand that that is how it legally works. I just think it's a crappy system. People who commit crimes should be encouraged to incorperate themselves into the legal world - making it near impossible to get a decent job doesn't strike me as a good way to promote rehabilitation for them.

The government routinely steps on the toes of the business community, and imposes laws for the "greater good of society." This should be no different. Will employers be put at a disadvantage? Absolutely. But that disadvantage will be more than made up for by the benefit to society as a whole. Why? Because employed people are less likley to commit crimes.
 
 
 
ILZ, The more you write, the less compassion I have for you.
 

Meh, if you were smart enough to be worth talking to, you'd be able to sack up and take me head on, instead of offering these meaningless jabs from the peanut gallery.

I think I'll live without your compassion.

I think Dr Susan Tolle is saying exactly the same as me. These sort of anomalies bring into sharp focus the lack of a decent national health service in America. I'm not saying the NHS here is perfect. But it works pretty well for most of the people most of the time, and we wont be going back to an ad hoc system of private medical insurance any time soon.
