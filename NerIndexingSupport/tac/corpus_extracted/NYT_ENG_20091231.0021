One of the most peculiar weeks in college football took another
bizarre twist on Wednesday when the lawyer for Texas Tech coach
Mike Leach was informed outside a courthouse in Lubbock, Texas,
that his client was fired.

Leach's dismissal came after he was suspended by the university
from coaching in the Alamo Bowl on Saturday for what it said was
his mistreatment of one of his players, Adam James, a sophomore
receiver who is the son of the ESPN broadcaster Craig James. Leach
was accused of isolating James in an equipment garage and a media
room while he was sitting out practice with a concussion. Texas
Tech officials said that Leach's actions, including not signing a
letter spelling out guidelines for dealing with players, and his
reaction to their investigation forced them to fire him.

"His contemporaneous statements make it clear that the coach's
actions against the player were meant to demean, humiliate and
punish the player rather than to serve the team's best interest,"
a Texas Tech statement said. "This action, along with his
continuous acts of insubordination, resulted in irreconcilable
differences that make it impossible for Coach Leach to remain at
Texas Tech."

Leach said his dismissal stemmed from bitterness on the board of
regents that lingered from his contentious contract negotiations
last year.

"Texas Tech's decision to deal in lies and fabricate a story
which led to my firing includes, but is not limited by, the
animosity remaining from last year's contract negotiations," Leach
said in a statement. "I will not tolerate such retaliatory action;
additionally, we will pursue all available legal remedies."

Leach, 48, was due a bonus of $800,000 on Dec. 31. A hearing was
scheduled Wednesday on an injunction he was seeking so he could
coach the Red Raiders on Saturday, but it never took place. Ruffin
McNeill, the defensive coordinator, is the interim coach.

The firing is another sign that the treatment of college
football players is being scrutinized more than ever. Leach is the
second Big 12 coach this month to lose his job after allegations of
abuse. Kansas' Mark Mangino resigned Dec. 3 amid a university
investigation into his treatment of players. Leach and Mangino were
assistants at Oklahoma in 1999 under coach Bob Stoops. When Kansas'
investigation of Mangino was announced last month, Leach spoke out
in support of him and called the probe a "witch hunt."

Leach's firing continues an odd week in college football.
Florida Coach Urban Meyer resigned on Saturday, then changed his
mind and announced on Sunday that he was taking an indefinite leave
of absence.

The aftermath of Leach's firing has been ugly. His supporters
are painting Craig James as an overzealous father who attended
nearly half of Texas Tech's practices this season and tried to
influence his son's playing time.

There are also critics of Texas Tech for firing a coach over
mistreatment of a player after it hired Bob Knight as basketball
coach following his well-documented history of mistreating players,
physically and verbally.

Several former and current players and coaches defended Leach
and criticized Adam James for his work ethic in e-mail messages
obtained by CBSSports.com. But many other Texas Tech players, in
interviews, supported James, who caught 17 passes this season.

"I do agree and I'm supporting Adam and what he's doing because
it's the right thing to do," receiver Tramain Swindall told The
Associated Press.

He added that "most of the players" agreed with the decision
and that there was a "negative vibe" in the program.

Behind his pass-happy spread offense, Leach had a record of
84-43 at Texas Tech and took it to a bowl game in each of his 10
seasons while becoming the university's leader in career victories.
Texas Tech is 8-4 this season.

The highlight of his tenure came last year when the Red Raiders
stunned Texas, then ranked No. 1, on a last-second touchdown. The
victory vaulted Texas Tech to No. 3 in the Associated Press poll,
its highest ranking, and into the thick of the national
championship race until a blowout defeat at Oklahoma.

But the Red Raiders still won a share of the Big 12 South title
and finished the regular season 11-1.

Leach has also thrived off the field. Texas Tech is ranked atop
the Big 12 in graduation rate.

But while Leach's success raised Texas Tech's national profile,
his eccentric, pirate-loving personality had begun to wear on the
university's administration, especially during the last year.

In February he agreed to a five-year, $12.7 million contract,
but only after he ignored two deadlines that the university had
imposed during negotiations. According to Leach's contract, Texas
Tech must pay him $400,000 for each remaining year.

In September, Leach barred his players from having Twitter pages
after linebacker Marlon Williams posted a message in which he asked
why he was still in a meeting room when "the head coach can't even
be on time."

The next month, after a loss to Texas A&M, Leach criticized his
players for listening to "their fat little girlfriends" and not
taking the Aggies seriously.

Despite those incidents, Leach seemed upbeat about his future at
Texas Tech during an interview earlier this month. He jokingly
questioned whether his team this season was the best in the history
of college football to have played three quarterbacks in a single
season.

On Wednesday, Texas Tech fans in the university's colors, black
and red, packed the Lubbock County courthouse hours before the
hearing that was to be held at 10 a.m. Others wore T-shirts that
read "I (HEART) Pirates," a reference to Leach's obsession with
pirates.

It was about 11:55 a.m. in the 99th District courtroom when
Leach's lawyer, Ted Liggett, read a letter from Texas Tech that
announced that Leach had been fired, setting off a chorus of boos.
"There was obviously some negative reaction," the county court
administrator, David Slayton, said in a telephone interview. "It
was pretty emotionally charged."
