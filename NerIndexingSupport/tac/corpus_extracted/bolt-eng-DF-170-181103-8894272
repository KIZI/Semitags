Again?
 
 
obama officially sacrifices all our efforts, our national security, our national interests, and his reelection hopes to a desperate, irresponsible stunt. We cannot afford in any way to let this fool occupy such an important office one minute longer than necessary. This idiot will slink back to Chicago next year but we may well pay for his feckless irresponsibility for a long time to come.
 
 
 
Again?

 

No..... Lil ' Dumbya HAS no role, this time.
 
 
It's 2009 again?

Wow... a year out from an election and we see this chestnut get dusted off again?? Color me shocked... NOT
 
 
I'm sure the Iranians and the Syrians are foaming out of their mouths, waiting for January 1, 2012 to arrive.

Another waste of American lives. The leftists got their way. They've been comparing the Iraq War to the Vietnam War for YEARS now.

The ONLY viable resemblance to the Vietnam War is the way the USA is, once again, leaving a free country completely vulnerable to attack by their hostile neighbors.

I can't wait to hear what the left wingnuts have to say after hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians are slaughtered by the Iranian and Syrian invaders. They sure were quick to blame the U.S. military for being responsible for Iraqi civilian deaths, weren't they!

Actually, as pissed as I am at Obama these days, I have to acknowledge that end of 2011 is when he originally said he'd have the troops home by. If it happens, that is, for once, a campaign promise kept.

The United States had expected that some of the roughly 40,000 Americans in Iraq would remain there to aid in training and security.

But the two nations were unable to reach a deal on a key issue regarding legal immunity for U.S. troops, a senior U.S. military official with direct knowledge of the discussions told CNN this month.

The smart money is that he pulls them out of Iraq and redeploys them to Iran or Africa. I just dont see it as being possible that the man wont keep troops deployed in combat zones around the globe. You have to think how Obama thinks, in his mind by pulling troops from Iraq that is a promise kept, it doesn't mean that he cant turn around and redeploy them to Iran or Africa. It would be gullible to think he would bring them home for good when there are so many more unfriendly "To him" dictators left in the world to overthrow.
He is the master of double speak and treason, so expect it.

actually, during the 2008 campaign, he promised a 16 month withdrawal from Iraq, should he be elected...

 News Analysis - Campaign Promises on Ending the War in Iraq Now Muted by Reality - NYTimes.com 

 
But as he moves closer to the White House, President-elect Obama is making clearer than ever that tens of thousands of American troops will be left behind in Iraq, even if he can make good on his campaign promise to pull all combat forces out within 16 months.

 

 
Nor has Mr. Obama laid out any timetable beyond 16 months for troop drawdowns, or suggested when he believes a time might come for a declaration that the war is over.

As much as they would like everyone to think THEY got him, it was Predator drone strikes that took out the convoy and wounded him, so we are pretty much directly responsible for his death. Not that I disagree that the man needed to go, I am just worried about what kind of dictator will be put in place that may be far worse.

No, that will come in another couple years when the repercussions of an early withdrawal kick in under a Republican president that leaves him/her no choice but to put troops back on the ground over there to protect civilians from atrocities, and then the Democrats/liberals/progressives can take to the streets again claiming that the evil warmongering republicans need to be kicked from office again. You see how this works? The Dems create problems and then turn around and point fingers and use said problems politically.
Just like when they gave bush overwhelming support to invade Iraq under the same information he had to invade, then turned around and flip flopped on the invasion and made the weaker minded folks believe that it was all evil Bush's fault that we where there to begin with. Trickery wont work this time, the people are watching.

It's time to come home from Iraq. We've given them a shot at democracy, and they want us out.

It's all smoke and mirrors, I remember a couple of years ago when they said all combat troops where removed and only support troops where left behind for support reasons. I had a buddy over there in a combat unit at the time, and he said all they did was rename the combat units support units and left them there. HAHAHA!!! And the left back here at home cheered!!!! Idiots.

Socialist China famously no longer needs CARE packages. The Socialist Democracies of Europe will be meeting to assuage the excesses of the prosperity afflicted, even in Greece. The Arab Spring, guided along by Biden-Hillary-Obama, has created even again a successful intervention--of a recognized Coalition, NATO--in the matter of Libya.

It will even soon be summer in Australia!

Maybe now attention can finally be turned to the Polar Bears of our planet.

The Posse Comitatus--or whatever it was--will finally be out of the Middle East, and terrorist attacks on the USA will cease to be policy in other places.

Predator drones will be the thing of the future I think, but we must be careful, because that could also come back to bite us in the ass.

LOL, lots of things could bite us in the ass. Like those 20,000 shoulder fired missiles that have gone missing in Libya, the ones that can shoot down an airplane. I hear some of them are in the Sinai, not far from Gaza. Wouldn't be surprised to see a few show up here, and one day shoot down a passenger plane or maybe even hit the capital building. I don't have a good feeling for the way things are going.

January 13, 2008

" The recession-deniers were muzzled by a horrendous last two weeks of December, and the gloom-and-doomers are now out in force. Their key arguments:

* Plummeting housing will now drag down the rest of the economy.

*The "bad debt" problem is not just "sub-prime" folks who should never have have taken out mortgages in the first place. It includes credit card debt, "high quality" mortgages, car loans, and other leverage that have recently become a consumer way of life.

*Pressure on consumers is leading to a reduction in consumer spending (70% of economy), which, in turn, will lead to a reduction in spending by companies that sell stuff to consumers.

*The question now is not "will there be a recession?" but "how bad will it get?"

*The most optimistic forecasts in a NYT gloom-and-doom round-up are for three crappy quarters, regardless of what the Fed does. Less optimistic forecasts suggest that we are, well, screwed.

After blowing the last downturn, we've been worried this one since last summer (see below). We also suspect that, given the importance of housing to the economy and debt to consumer spending, the recession will be deeper and more prolonged than people think. "

It seems obama does what he wants to just say someone else is incharge and still use the military as his own little toy. OH and let's not forget about the presidental drones that obama seems to like to use.

Good, I'm glad to hear it even if it does end up making Obama look a little bit better as a President. We should have been out of there years ago, like shortly after Hussein was seen dangling from the end of a rope.

We don't need ground troops there or anywhere in the ME. We've got the best Spec Op forces in the world and they are more than capable of taking out the terrorists whenever those slime balls lift up their heads.

Good decision, President Obama, I hope you are not speaking with a forked tongue.

Really? And without any kind of support, infrastructure, or base of operations they can just fly in like comic book super heroes and easily eliminate any group, nation, or movement just like that? Are you that naive?
 
 
yay,

I have to give Obama credit for finally getting out of this crap hole. We did everything we could to give Iraq a chance...Now it is up to them. I'm glad to see this president pulling our troops out of there, so they can be with their families and friends once again. Hopefully soon he does this with Afghanistan, ect. The middle east isn't our job to fix or to defend... I support this move by Obama. No more war without a good reason for it...

It's about time.
 
 
 
 
We don't need ground troops there or anywhere in the ME. We've got the best Spec Op forces in the world and they are more than capable of taking out the terrorists whenever those slime balls lift up their heads.

 

Really? And without any kind of support, infrastructure, or base of operations they can just fly in like comic book super heroes and easily eliminate any group, nation, or movement just like that? Are you that naive?

 

Did we have support on the ground in Grenada?

How about Pakistan when we sent bin Ladin to his final resting place?

What we are accomplishing today in Iraq is exactly what President Bush said we would not be doing... nation building. That is all that we have been doing since the death of Hussein. We don't need to have ground troops there with targets on their backs. Haven't needed them there since shortly after we went in country.

So I ask you, are you really so naive to believe we do?

Immie
 
 
 
 
 
Oh did you want us to die some more?

Sorry.

 

No, that will come in another couple years when the repercussions of an early withdrawal kick in under a Republican president that leaves him/her no choice but to put troops back on the ground over there to protect civilians from atrocities...

 

Ah, yes..... gotta keep Wall $ treet happy !!!!

Good, I'm glad to hear it even if it does end up making Obama look a little bit better as a President. We should have been out of there years ago, like shortly after Hussein was seen dangling from the end of a rope.

We don't need ground troops there or anywhere in the ME. We've got the best Spec Op forces in the world and they are more than capable of taking out the terrorists whenever those slime balls lift up their heads.

Good decision, President Obama, I hope you are not speaking with a forked tongue.

Thank you for the graphic. I knew someone would dig one of those up for me.  

I'm not sure what you are saying here though. My understanding is that those 50,000 troops are coming home or more likely being redeployed. Are you saying that he is keeping the 50,000 there? If so, then what exactly is changing? Was he, in fact, speaking with a forked tongue again?

Immie
 
 
 
Did we have support on the ground in Grenada?

 

Yes, we did. We had support in-country and from the Organization of Eastern Carribean States. AND, Grenada was one of the smallest independent states in the Western Hemisphere.

Idiot.
 
 
This really is Bush's fault.
 
 
 
How about Pakistan when we sent bin Ladin to his final resting place?

 

We had, and needed, every minute of ten years worth of infrstructure-building that resulted in that successful operation. You could not have picked a worse example for your fantasy-theory that you can just shout "special forces!" like "Avengers Assemble!" and super heroes will fly in from nowhere to destroy any force and save the day.

You're an idiot.
 
 
 
Although I would love to see our troops home. Announcing it to our enemies is not a good idea

 

Yeah, they would never hear it anywhere else... or see our troops packing up...
 
 
12/31/11 Was a date set by President Bush in the infamous shoe throwin' press conference.

 
Bush offered Maliki the date of December 31, 2011 for all combat forces to withdraw from Iraq. Maliki countered that the end of 2011 sounded just fine, but that all American forces would be gone by then. Bush reluctantly agreed to this, and to the June, 2009 deadline for American troops to be out of Iraqi cities.

We do not need 50,000 troops with targets painted on their backs to take out one or two terrorists a year you fool. What are these one or two terrorists a year costing us in lives of soldiers and money?

What part of that do you not understand?

All we are accomplishing in Iraq is damned nation building. How many more soldiers are you willing to sacrifice to get the next terrorist?

We don't need ground troops there at all.

And I don't believe we had ground troops in Grenada or Pakistan before the invasions. Got any facts to back up your claims?

50,000 was just a numerical figure so to dpeak, not to mention that how many we had when obama said we were pulling out last year. He won't pull them out it isn't going to happen. He will use words that sound like there aren't troops there but they'll be there. Remember when he teryed to change the meaning of attack or war "overseas contingency operations" or "man-caused disasters" He'll just play with the words

I'm sure the Iranians and the Syrians are foaming out of their mouths, waiting for January 1, 2012 to arrive.

Another waste of American lives. The leftists got their way. They've been comparing the Iraq War to the Vietnam War for YEARS now.

The ONLY viable resemblance to the Vietnam War is the way the USA is, once again, leaving a free country completely vulnerable to attack by their hostile neighbors.

I can't wait to hear what the left wingnuts have to say after hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians are slaughtered by the Iranian and Syrian invaders. They sure were quick to blame the U.S. military for being responsible for Iraqi civilian deaths, weren't they!

 

Oh did you want us to die some more?

Sorry.

 

Yea, I'm sure that's what he wants.

What a totally moronic thing to say. Get a grip on reality and do not let go again.

Yes, we did. We had support in-country and from the Organization of Eastern Carribean States. AND, Grenada was one of the smallest independent states in the Western Hemisphere.

Those are not U.S. ground forces and we would have the same kind of support in the ME just as we did in Pakistan.

Can you argue without the name calling?

We don't need ground troops there at all.

There is NO need to do anything outside of defending our own nation(homeland), which we're not doing as we allow millions of illegals to invade our home land. No matter how low they're or what crimes they have caused. We should only defend our own land and allow other nations to defend there selfs. We could do some real cuts than.

Not our job to get into the islamic war that has been gong on for 1,400 years and will be going on most likely 1,400 years from now in 3411. It is pure insanity, I believe. My suggestion is to Close the borders, lock the doors and to hell with them...Let them kill each other.

It's not worth our blood or treasure to play empire as it is not worth it. Everyone and every time, we try to help, they HATES us even more. Americans for Americans and that is just the way it should be. War is something that we do only in our national defense. Who the fuck are we to ask our sons to die for another people?

If I'm coming off insane to you; than you must like us in every nation on earth. Why not call us a empire...The roman empire more or less did the same thing using its military to protect other nations and allowing them to join unders its wing. Why do we do it? Why not take our wealth and use it on bettering our self and our people.

Call me what you will, but what sense does it make being a nation that thinks it can stop every war, feed every people and wipe every mans ass for them. Not our job!
 
 
Obama-the-Idiot is taking a big chance here. If he moves us out and the regime falls into chaos, it'll guarantee that he gets trounced in 2012.

I agree with Immanuel and his points.

The US's position would be far better today if USA had spent 1-2% of the Iraq-money into better intelligence and counter-operations. USA's PR would still be good and its finances, too.

What terrorist attacks out of Middle-East actually happened against USA independent from US invasion into Iraq?
There was the Navy ship in Yemen (Al-Qaeda-Afghanistan).
Else?

Iraq adventure was a total fail and kicked-off the process of American decline in Middle-East.
So, what have you achieved in Iraq and what were the results for your regional interests besides damaging your PR and forcing regional actors to the conclusion that USA is an aggressor? Off course, from US-centric view you call your actions in Iraq like "generous nation-building", giving a "shot for democracy".
That's not how it's viewed outside of USA.. instead things like yellow-cake from Nigeria, mushroom-clouds and Abu-Ghraib will be written into history books.

Without Iraq adventure the agenda-setting capability in Middle-East would still be in hands of USA. And without the Iraq adventure the USA would also have a better position when it comes intelligence gathering as US's position within most Middle-Eastern countries would be far better and you would have a better pool of willing local informants to gather intelligence.

Now, to the "US Special Forces" flying in like comic heroes... Well, countries hosting terrorist elements are anyway failed states without any worthy military capabilities.
Flying in into Yemen to track down USS Cole bombers is a military operation without much risks (relative).

Which country in Middle-East hosts Al-Qaeda elements? If Al-Qaeda can recruit fighters out of certain countries in Middle-East, they'll travel into those failed states like Afghanistan, Yemen...

We could not have pulled off the overthrow of Iraq with just special forces. Unk, is lying when he claims that is what I said. We had to move in as we did with the full forces of the U.S. Military. However, once Iraq's army was subdued, we did not need to maintain the nation building forces we did simply to fight terrorists.

As for what I did say, I said that we didn't need the full force of the U.S. Military in Iraq to take out terrorists. Our Special Forces can do that a lot more efficiently than painting targets on the backs of our men and women in Iraq and corralling them in Baghdad letting them dodge bullets.

Unk is nothing buy a liar who has done nothing to defend his point of view. His idea of winning an argument is calling everyone he does not agree with idiots. I suspect that makes him think he is a champion debater. That and putting words in other people's mouths

Let's not forget, Bush could never have went to war in Iraq, without the democrats approval. How convenient for you to forget that little gem.

 

It's all they want to do...forget the congressional record.

More to the point of why we are leaving Iraq:

Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki says the U.S. decision to withdraw troops from Iraq by the end of the year came after the Iraqi government refused to guarantee legal immunity for U.S. service members in Iraq.

Maliki spoke to reporters Saturday, a day after U.S. President Barack Obama announced the withdrawal. The United States had asked for immunity for a small group of U.S. troops to remain in Iraq to help with training and counter influence of neighboring Iran.

About 39,000 U.S. troops remain in Iraq, down from a high of about 165,000 in 2008.

Also Saturday, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton vowed that the withdrawal of troops will not end the U.S. commitment to Iraq

However, once Iraq's army was subdued, we did not need to maintain the nation building forces we did simply to fight terrorists.

 

You don't like being called an idiot, yet you keep posting stupid shit like this. Have you been asleep for the past decade or so, shitforbrains? You may enjoy living in your own little fantasy world, but that does not make it relevant to this real one. Everything about the (recent, so no excuse) history of the insurgency in Iraq directly contradicts your childish imaginings about what you think could have happened. Yes, you are an idiot.

You don't recall the Battle for Fallujah? A smaller force would have done better there?

You don't recall brave Iaqis defying the terrorists to go and vote on their nation's future? They would have been able to do that with a smaller US presence?

You don't recall what turned things around and enabled us to get the upper hand on the insurgency? What was the word? Surge? Does that sound like more or less force to you, idiot?

Everyday for 9 years, thousands of examples along those same lines, but YOU think a small group could have done just fine because you could invoke the magic words 'Special Forces.' That's just fucking stupid. You're just fucking stupid.

Maybe you want to go back to the Clinton-era approach to terrorism as a mere 'police matter,' but that was painfully proven to be a failure, and your ignorance and juvenile wishes won't help anyone.

Where does that say that I thought the Special Forces could take down the Iraqi Army? I did not say that we did not need the U.S. Military for large scale ops as your lies indicated. But we have not been large scale ops in Iraq for years. What I did say is that our Spec Ops Forces are more than capable to take out the terrorists that pop up their heads and until you can get your head out of your ass and prove to me that they are not capable of doing so, I stand by that statement.

The battles for Fallujah were in 2003 and 2004. Before Iraq was fully subdued and the first battle was even before Saddam was captured.

Why is it our responsibility to make Iraq a "little USA"? Why must we make them a democracy? We should not be there at all right now. But people like you think it is our responsibility to play world police force.

Give me one good reason, besides Bush said we should be there, for us to be in Iraq today?

Victory there by US, UK, and Iraqi National Forces was a significant blow against the terrorist insurgency.

But no, you in all your military genius are just sure a small band of Special Forces could have taken care of it instead....

We don't need ground troops there or anywhere in the ME. We've got the best Spec Op forces in the world and they are more than capable of taking out the terrorists whenever those slime balls lift up their heads.

 

Really? And without any kind of support, infrastructure, or base of operations they can just fly in like comic book super heroes and easily eliminate any group, nation, or movement just like that? Are you that naive?

Give me one good reason, besides Bush said we should be there, for us to be in Iraq today?

You should give thanks everyday that short-sighted fools like yourself are not responsible for your own safety or for stability in this world. The fact that ignorant morons like you are secure enough to play at historically illiterate fantasies says alot about the quality of your betters that allow you that luxury.
 
 
 
 
The battles for Fallujah were in 2003 and 2004. Before Iraq was fully subdued and the first battle was even before Saddam was captured.
.

 

The First Battle for Fallujah took place nearly a year after the defeated Iraqi army had been disbanded, idiot.

Victory there by US, UK, and Iraqi National Forces was a significant blow against the terrorist insurgency.

But no, you in all your military genius are just sure a small band of Special Forces could have taken care of it instead....  

There's the door if you want to start parsing, spinning, and dancing your way backward out of it.

 

The occupation of Fallujah took place in April of 2003

Then in April of 2004 there was what was called "the first battle of Fallujah

 First Battle of Fallujah - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 

Followed by a third in November/December of 2004.

 Second Battle of Fallujah - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 

My God are you really this stupid to make the same lie again when you were proven to be a liar and you just moments ago claimed you had not said that and called me an F'ing moron for saying you did?

 
But no, you in all your military genius are just sure a small band of Special Forces could have taken care of it instead....  

 

How stupid are you?

By the way, stop altering my posts. It is against the rules.

I'd knew you'd start spinning and parsing soon enough. I don't blame you for feeling embarrassed.

No, I'm not. So no, you don't.

Who's feeling embarrassed?

You have not proven your point yet and you continue to post your lies. It is you that should be feeling embarrassed.

But, for the record, I did make an error on the comment about the "First Battle of Fallujah". I never said I was perfect. In fact, I haven't said I am right in regards to this discussion, but I am still waiting for you to come up with some reason why we need 50,000 soldiers to take out a few terrorists a year.

Still waiting and expect to be waiting for a hell of a long time.

No, I'm not. So no, you don't.

 

Now, can we get down to a legitimate discussion about this?

I would be more than happy to talk about why you think we still need all those soldiers in Iraq. I don't think we need them there today. I think they are corralled in Baghdad with targets on their backs and it is inefficient to leave them there.

There are many people who I have spoken to that have military backgrounds who disagree with me. They tell me if we left or if we leave it will cause a vacuum in the leadership of Iraq and we will be right back where we were with Saddam Hussein in just a matter of a few years.

It is my contention that this will happen anyway and that we are not accomplishing anything by staying there. I truly believe that our Spec Forces can handle the operations that get the terrorists cells as they are outed.

Maybe I am wrong, but I don't see "the mission" in Iraq. Maybe it is because I have lost faith in the powers that be in Washington that I think we are (God forbid it) wrong for trying to force our way of life on people who don't want anything to do with us.

I would like to apologize for my part in this argument and start over.

I fully expect that you have good reasons for disagreeing with me. I would be interested in reading those reasons. Maybe neither one of us will change the mind of the other, but there is nothing wrong with being open minded.

PS Maybe this would have worked if I had read the quoted post before I made my last post.  
 
 
Well. That fullfills my expectations of Obama as it was the reason I voted for him.

I am glad we are finally getting out of that hole.

I think many are missing the point as to why U.S. troops are leaving Iraq by December 31, 2011:

 
Obama announces U.S. troops leaving Iraq by year's end

The Associated Press
Date: Fri. Oct. 21 2011

In recent months, Washington had been discussing with Iraqi leaders the possibility of several thousand American troops remaining to continue training Iraqi security forces.

Throughout the discussions, Iraqi leaders refused to give U.S. troops immunity from prosecution in Iraqi courts, and the Americans refused to stay without that guarantee.

Moreover, Iraq's leadership has been split on whether it wanted American forces to stay.

When the 2008 agreement requiring all U.S. forces to leave Iraq was passed, many U.S. officials assumed it would inevitably be renegotiated so that Americans could stay longer.

The U.S. said repeatedly this year it would entertain an offer from the Iraqis to have a small force stay behind, and the Iraqis said they would like American military help. But as the year wore on and the number of American troops that Washington was suggesting could stay behind dropped, it became increasingly clear that a U.S. troop presence was not a sure thing.

The issue of legal protection for the Americans was the deal-breaker.

As I understand it, Obama could have left troops in Iraq past year-end - but because Iraqi leaders refused to give U.S. troops immunity from prosecution in Iraqi courts - Obama is pulling them out. Thank you, Mr. President.

That's nice spin for the fact that Obama's administration didn't have the diplomatic leverage to get immunity for our soldiers.

I would have thought the TROOPS would have been sufficient "leverage"... Should Obama have offered them a few more billion dollars in additional to TROOPS...?

How would you have negotiated it...? Or would you just invade again like the Bush boys?

I'm not claiming to have the skills and resources needed to shore up the gains we've made in the region.

But then again, I never claimed I should be president.
 
 
 
obama officially sacrifices all our efforts, our national security, our national interests, and his reelection hopes to a desperate, irresponsible stunt. We cannot afford in any way to let this fool occupy such an important office one minute longer than necessary. This idiot will slink back to Chicago next year but we may well pay for his feckless irresponsibility for a long time to come.

 

 
" As right - wing pundits decry the end of one US war and the conduct of another, they'd do well to consider the case of Sgt. 1st Class Kristoffer Bryan Domeij. The 10-year veteran of the elite Army Rangers was killed, along with two of his comrades, in an IED attack in Afghanistan on October 22. But Domeij's situation was special: He perished on his 14 th war deployment since 2002.

I'm sure the Iranians and the Syrians are foaming out of their mouths, waiting for January 1, 2012 to arrive.

Another waste of American lives. The leftists got their way. They've been comparing the Iraq War to the Vietnam War for YEARS now.

The ONLY viable resemblance to the Vietnam War is the way the USA is, once again, leaving a free country completely vulnerable to attack by their hostile neighbors.

I can't wait to hear what the left wingnuts have to say after hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians are slaughtered by the Iranian and Syrian invaders. They sure were quick to blame the U.S. military for being responsible for Iraqi civilian deaths, weren't they!

 

Oh did you want us to die some more?

Sorry.

 

What's this "us" shit? Do you have a mouse in your pocket? Like you would ever protect and defend your country, you fool.
