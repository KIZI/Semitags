Because they have a death penalty for murderers?
I think they should bring it here in the UK, sort out all the rapists, paedophiles, murderers etc.

Yes we do and I'd sign every one of them, especialy the mass hanging of 17 innocent people.

I would actually be all for airing it on pay-per-view. Huge revenue opportunity waiting to be tapped into.

I think its the truth, because i know, because i have lived there.

And it shouldn't be surprising, the human rights here are second to none and expatriate labor are basically treated like crap. They dont allow trade unions for god sake.

Doesn't matter as far as I'm concerned. The death penalty is barbaric and fails to act as a deterrent anyway.
 
 
So they're going to kill 17 people for the murder of one person solely on the basis of a forced confession and clearly faked 'CCTV footage'? How can they even call that justice?

"You're very lucky to find a decent Arab" - that's a disgusting thing to say. Remember the UK has been involved in torture (extraordinary rendition), has allowed British citizens to be held without trial, illegal wars etc. so by your logic there isn't a decent British person out there.

That's what they're arguing, I doubt it was based solely on that though. It does seem extreme that all 17 of them could be hung but if they all colluded to murder this man they are all equally responsible. There was a similar case in Germany where a British guy was (allegedly) killed by a German cult but the German authorities claimed it was simply a road accident.

No thats just the people with power. Everyday arabs i have seen, meet, are well basically stupid. To the point were well one told me "MY people are better than your people". How would that make sense to you.

Yes I did know some very very good arab friends. The ones who were aware about the world. The ones who used there mind, not the ones who bossed around people from a different race because they had more money.
 
 
I WILL NOT SIGN!...life and the world is unfair, get on with it. The world is blind beyond expectation, yet you open your eyes for this. A true PITY! Wheres the petition for all those who die daily in third world countries, and those who die in eastern countries for unjest legal systems? NO petition for them.  
 
 
they need to be hanged for selling drugs and killing another man...

whats point in having a law if you dont apply it ? what kind of message does it send ? kill someone start a internet petition and get away with it, and also its not 17 sikhs it 17 people

You find that in every race, not all or even most Arabs are like that. In this country, immigrants are exploited all the time for cheap labour with employers paying lower than minimum wage and making them work illegal hours in illegal conditions. American companies do it as well exploiting foreign labour and making them work in extremely bad conditions.
 
 
Not Signed Lololololol

Not really. They may well be guilty (although I can't see 17 people ever getting convicted for one murder in this country) but the legal process hasn't been fair. They've been cut out of the loop with a lawyer speaking a different language and there are allegations of torture that need investigating.

I have no idea how it works but surely the UN or someone should get some impartial people to bring out the truth..

Exactly this. WE do not know if they did commit the crime or not. The dubai COURT has evaluated the evidence and said that they have commited the crime. That's it. They should be allowed to appeal (if they can in Dubai), but apart from this they have been sentenced.

This isn't about kissing in public.

Kissing in public is one of the LAWS in Dubai.

You go to Dubai, you live by THEIR LAWS.

You live in the UK you live by UK LAWS

You go to the US of A, you live by THEIR LAWS.

Don't like the laws, then GTFO

Laws which are ridiculous so don't live in Dubai. What are you trying to get across?
 
 
I'm not against the death penalty, but you should at least have a fair trial before it is decided.

They don't exist in every industry and it's even worse that widespread exploitation exists when you consider trade unions do exist. Also, it's not guaranteed that they will help - just look at the BA strikes.

Still you can speak up to some extent and get recognized, over there if you even whisper, you go to jail.

Plus certain things are even ridiculous. Have you ever heard of the price they charge for internet there?

Oh so being hung for committing crime which involved murdering a man is ridiculous?

This thread was about 17 people being hung for a crime they didn't commit, not because they were kissing in public. If you think that kissing in public is not committing crime, then post in the relevant thread. The kissing in public rule may be ridiculous, but we're talking in the context of committing serious crime, which involved murdering a man.

This is the reason for my first post.

That's irrelevant as it doesn't support your argument that "it's rare to find a decent Arab". The price of petrol here is 10x higher than it is there and petrol is an essential commodity for everyone as it affects food prices, travel, work etc. so does that mean "it's rare to find a decent Englishman"?

/thread

 

The rather gaping hole in that arguement is the allegations of mistreatment + torture of the accused, forced confessions and falsified evidence. I'm not saying they're innocent but the case needs investigating by someone impartial (like the UN).

If it the claims turn out to be true then I wouldn't call it a court or a judicial process, more a joke. Of course if it turns out to be desperate lies then they'll have to live (well die) with the laws of the state they were in.
 
 
Signed. Fed up of blatant class oppression.

And who builds Dubai's utopia? Migrant workers in Dubai are treated sickeningly. Most are tricked into coming into the country under the pretense that they will have a secure job and the chance to visit their families once a year. Instead they are paid pittance for doing long hours, are laid off with no warning, work in extremely hazardous environments and are often provided with third world style shack accomodation (corrugated metal, wooden boards etc). Of course some here will claim that their labour has been worthwhile since it resulted in the [obscene,] extravagant display of wealth we see today. Dubai may be weaker within the capitalist mainframe now compared to a few years ago, but how long have the capitalists been ignoring stuff like this simply because they believe ends justify the means when a society is 'developing'?

Give it 20 years, people won't remember or care how Dubai was built. The same story, over and over again.

Petrol is obviously extracted here so naturally it would be cheap. No its not rare to find a decent englishman because people in the UK at least have some understanding about the world around.

In a way I meant about arabs because most of them are to busy getting to know themselves. I have been lucky enough to know a few good arabs but the vast majority of well are different to say the least. I say this because I have lived there.

Btw the internet that would normaly cost about 15 pounds there is about 70 pounds here. That was obvious because there was a monopoly but another company came and I did found out that there were both controlled by the government who gave the order for the prices they could set.

And consider this, petrol maybe essential for travel etc blah blah, but a thing like the internet, do you think society now days could live without facebook?

If Facebook closed down tomorrow, the economy wouldn't collapse. If oil prices fluctuate even slightly it has a significant effect on the economy and if oil dried up tomorrow, economies worldwide would collapse.

Not punishment: rehabilitation.

If it's just one person, there may be any number of events or influences etc affecting that person to commit homicide, such as drug use, depression, anger issues, lack of judgement etc. These people may have the potential to be treated and made safe for re entry back into society. If they commit more than one homicide, they are more of a threat to other people, however just the one under special circumstances does not deem them a threat to everyone. Rehabilitation could sort them out and ensure they don't do it again, allowing them to become a productive member of society.

If it was more than one case of homicide, the person is likely to be dangerous to other people and there is more of a case for the death penalty then. However, there are alternatives to the death penalty or life imprisonment that can be more beneficial, such as forcing them to work while in prison (as in America) for their entire lives.

Killing them straight off for one murder does nothing other than to deter others willing to murder, although I doubt those willing to kill someone else will care about their punishment.

Ditto

We will never know the actual truth, as we weren't present when the actual item being discussed happened, as in many other cases.

In these cases then we must rely upon courts and judicial processes.

Assuming these people didn't commit the crime it implies Dubai does not have a legal system able to give a fair trial to those accused of murder. America has a proper legal system.

I enjoy being hung.

Well course, but consider the internet as a whole. By some miracle if it went down, it wouldn't be the economy collapsing rather it would chaos and havoc.

Besides oil is a limited resource. It will end one day and Dubai as a city have thier own head up their ass because they only control about 5%(i think) of the oil which is soon expected to run out in about 2015.

90% is controlled by Abu Dhabi but that to will end someday.

And I still maintain that it is hard to find an arab who at least uses his mind. You do get the idiot in class who says school is a waste and my dad has a lot of money and blah blah. There it may be about one in ten.

Her it is 9 in 10. I say this because I have experienced it first hand.

No, you're only talking about the elite in Dubai, and that sort of behaviour exists in not just Arabs but the elite everywhere - just go to Orange County or some other place in the US and you'll see the incredibly rich there are embarrassing. Most Arabs aren't like that at all and wrt to the internet, we're talking about the price of internet access and I maintain that oil is still a far more valuable commodity then the internet and is far cheaper (10x cheaper) whereas internet is only a few times more expensive. That's not the Arabs' fault though, internet access is more expensive in many countries and much cheaper in the far East due to the companies providing the internet access.

Fair enough they do exist in all places but in minorities, here it is in the majorities.

Consider this, about 70% of the working population are expatriates. Naturally the government does everything to keep them above everyone else. The support they get here is ridiculous.

And consider this also, we are having a reasoned debate but if you were to have this with an arab, I think he would blantaly say " my people are better than your people"

Internet may very well be cheap but they allowed another company to come into the market to sell internet yet they were controlling the prices and basically telling the world that look its not a monopoly anymore. Thats just hypocrisy.

Btw I do not mean ALL arabs in generals, just the ones that were born and raised in the arab emirates.

What crimes deserve the death penalty?!  
 
 
I'm sure Dubai will care about what anyone else thinks and I'm sure this online petition will be taken to heart by the good leaders of Dubai.

I don't agree with the death penalty in any situation. It's barbaric and stoops to the level of the person that committed the crime.

How one human can advocate the killing of another is simply beyond me.

Proper prison sentences.

And just so you know, I'm too tired for a sad online flame war, so take it elsewhere before it escalates.

Oh no i'm not looking for an argument about what should be right or wrong it is far too late and tbh we could argue about this for the end of time. Tbh i would favour it, but i have lost faith in are legel system cause its a joke, its sad but true

Indeed indeed.  
 
 
In any case, I fail to see how the murder of one man necessitates taking the lives of 17 others.

Signed.
 
 
Many thanks to those who signed, got about 20 pages of sigs yesterday, altho the petition on it's own may not do much, with the other protests going on they may just listen.

cheers Arthur.

If they don't have the right to take another human's life, whether emotionally or physically, we don't have the right to condemn them to death either.

Better to pay taxes and keep decent morals intact, than become the murderers ourselves.

ETA: As someone else said, I don't want to get into a war on the interwebs, so we'll agree to disagree

Yep, of course. If we wish to 'sort someone out' we should just kill them. Obviously it is as clean cut as 1) person raped someone 2) they should die. It has almost worked as a deterrent in countries such as America. Not quite, but almost. Maybe it would be different here. Maybe a murderer is always rational enough and has enough time to consider the consequences.

Although some innocent people would no doubt be killed it is obvious that they must be happy to accept that a few like themselves must sacrifice their lives to allow such a wonderful form of justice that has pure retribution as its aim and an archaic mentality of "you stole my chariot so i will steal yours".

In case you haven't picked it up, that was sarcastic.

Is it just me or is the strength of this argument lost when you can't spell the word paedophile? I mean, if you're going to advocate killing someone at least do them the service of spelling it right.

Is it just me, or are you that sort of Douche that comes here to troll about how people can't spell a word? Sorry its not one of those words I use a lot  
 
 
How can the state sponsored murder of seventeen men, be acceptable for the murder of one man. Thats before we even consider if the evidence is flawed.

Whilst I respect the need to live by the laws of the country you live in, we can still question the human rights issue that is being presented. Yes even murderers are allowed access to rights.

Its funny cause I do lol......The computer I was using at the time did not and so as a result did not highlight the fact there was a incorrect spelt word, sorry for the inconvenience of reading one :/

In my view the death penalty should not be handed out to every man women and child that commits a crime. There should be exceptions. People are convicted as serials killers, should not be given the opportunity to experience our compassion through human rights. Did they consider that the people they killed had the right to live? I don't think so or else they may still be walking this Earth. To give such a person several life sentences (life should be life, not 20 years in a singe sentence) should be considered a crime, especially in our prisons. I don't see why the tax payer should have to pay to keep these people alive. If they have been convicted in court, and evidence is to the extent where you cannot be proven innocent, then why should we show compassion for a person who showed no compassion in the first place. What message our we sending to our country :/ If you are convicted of being a serial killer/serial rapist, you will get labelled as the worst possible human being on the planet. But hey don't worry you get free a room, free food, free water and basis human rights, all you have to do is be isolated from society and live with people who are just like you  

(this is the message the proud nation of Britain is sending the people like this, and don't tell me it is not. What make me "cringe" is that if you show that have "completely change" after serving half your sentence, the courts will consider cutting your sentence short and release these people back into society with a new identity and on benefits. Do you really want this for your children if you have them, i personally do not

I was only trying to point you in the right direction to avoid people pointing it out in future. It's quite annoying when people do, I used to be terrible for it.  

I still stand by the belief, that when you are killing someone for killing someone that is kinda ironic. When you bring yourself to the same level as them, you become no better than them. I personally think it would be disgusting to use tax payers money to kill these people. Then again that's just my opinion, counts for very little. (I don't even live in the UK.)

It may not morally make us better than them in that circumstance, but the difference would be that our actions would hopefully defer people from committing such offences, the system we have does not work, the life sentence policy is a sad joke. Your opinion does matter, and so does everyone else for that matter, i suppose if i felt it did not i would not be commenting right now.

All I meant was I live on the Isle of Man. In the grand scheme of things we don't have very much power.

Whether I'm a troll, douche or any other type of [insert derogatory term here] is for others to decide, I guess. But your obvious inability to spell the word paedophile shows you haven't actually thought through your stance on the death penalty very well.

If Martin Luther King was corrected by one of his people through a minor error he made, are you telling me this rightfully undermines all the equality he fought for?

Are you genuinely comparing yourself to Martin Luther King?

I was outlining how stupid and how much as a waste of a comment you made about one spelling mistake, does your life seriously have that little of meaning to be sat their criticising a person over a spelling mistake

CALM DOWN! DON'T HAVE A HISSY FIT!        
 
 
It's hanged not hung. Don't know whether anyone has pointed that out yet.

What was the outcome of this case? Does anyone know? If their justice system is as expedient as China's then they are probably dead by now.

By comparing yourself to Martin Luther King? no.
 
 
The case has been delayed so that there can be an investigation.
