DeNucci's unjustified raisesSAY IT ain't so, Joe. In a shameless
Beacon
Hill ritual, outgoing state Auditor A. Joseph DeNucci is rewarding
his
staff with a 5 percent raise, retroactive to July 1. Through a
spokesman,
DeNucci defended the raises as just compensation for a staff that
hasn't
seen a pay boost in nearly four years and has taken 11 furlough
days over
the last two years, a concession equivalent to a 4 percent wage
reduction.

DeNucci's defense is weak and his timing couldn't be worse.

The state's unemployment rate is 9 percent. Many in the private
sector
workforce have lost jobs and benefits. In the public sector, state
programs
are being cut and more state workers face layoffs.

Governor Patrick already eliminated 2,700 positions in the
executive
branch and, as of October 2008, froze merit pay increases for all
5,000
managers. The 34,000 unionized employees who make up the bulk of
the state
work force were given a 1 percent pay increase over the last three
years.
The state budget that took effect on July 1 is expected to lead to
scores
of additional layoffs elsewhere in state government.

DeNucci is clearly taking care of his own, at the expense of
taxpayers, as
he goes out the door. That's disappointing. It's also disappointing
that
three of five candidates who are seeking to replace him as the
state's
fiscal watchdog are unwilling to call him out.

Democrat Mike Lake and Republican Kamal Jain said they would
rescind the
raises. Jain called the increases "disrespectful to the
taxpayers" and
Lake described them as "a parting gift at just the wrong moment in
time."

But Suzanne Bump, the Democratic candidate who was endorsed by
DeNucci,
dismisses the calls to rescind the raises as "facile political
posturing." Bump said if she's elected, she will review all
staffing and
compensation levels and determine what's appropriate.

Worcester County Sheriff Guy Glodis, another Democrat in the
race, said he,
too, would review pay and staffing levels if elected, but would not
pass
judgment on whether the salary increases are justified.

On the Republican side, Mary Z. Connaughton criticized the
raises, but
also said it is too soon to call for rescinding them.

If these candidates can't see the raises for that they are - a
fiscally
unwise move by a lameduck state auditor - how can voters expect
them to see
waste, fraud, and corruption if they win election as the next state
auditor?

It's significant that all the candidates, Democrats and
Republicans, seem
to regard DeNucci, who has been in office for 24 years, as a
respectable
public servant who nonetheless represents an outmoded approach to
being
auditor. Giving everyone in the office a goodbye gift at taxpayer's
expense
is one tradition that has to end. Bump, Glodis, and Connaughton
need to
acknowledge it.
