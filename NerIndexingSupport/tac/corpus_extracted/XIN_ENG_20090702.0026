U.S. ambassador to Lebanon Michel Sison expressed Thursday her country's strong
support to the Lebanese security forces, Elnashra website reported.

"It is necessary for you to be trained and ready to carry out your duties for
the protection of the Lebanese people and state," Sison told police members
during the 98th training course graduation ceremony.

She revealed that during the U.S. training of Lebanese police menders, new
friendship was established between the officers of the Lebanese Interior
Security Forces (ISF) and the American instructors, along with the 254 police
members.

"The ISF played a major role in preserving the sovereignty of a democratic
Lebanon," Sison said, stressing that the ISF's major role is the enforcement of
democratic principles.

Since January 2008, U.S. instructors have trained 1690 police members, 153
instructors and 96 supervisors and administrators, Sison said.

"We are proud of our training program," Sison said, adding that the trainees
should be proud of their achievements in order to protect the interests of the
Lebanese people.

The U.S. expressed reservations before Lebanon's June 7 parliamentary elections
regarding its military aid to Lebanon in case the Hezbollah-led opposition won
the elections. However, the elections granted victory to the pro-western ruling
majority over the Hezbollah-led opposition.
