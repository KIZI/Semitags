 
 
The Way Back
 
 
Anyone going to watch this? It looks quite good.
 
 
Yep sometime this week or next, looks promising.
 
 
I think it'll be a sleeper hit, the story looks so epic as well as genuinely interesting and it's even better because it's based on a true story... but I doubt people are even talking about it that much right now, depending on the kind of friends you have I guess

That being said, I do want to see it  
 
 
Went to see it today. Pretty good overall, the pacing was a bit off at times though. Def worth a watch
 
 
I want to see it on the basis that Collin Farrell is staring in it, i enjoy almost all movies hes in.
 
 
I had real difficulties finding this film in a cinema near me, but I'm glad I did.

Really well made film. Kept me gripped from start to finish. My one gripe - the films opens with the caption "3 men crossed the Himalayas into India, this film is dedicated to them". For me, this spoilt things a little; you inevitably spend half the film guessing who's going to make it and who won't.

Deserves a wider release. Good acting from everyone involved; I'd love to see Ed Harris sneak in with a best supporting actor Oscar nomination.
