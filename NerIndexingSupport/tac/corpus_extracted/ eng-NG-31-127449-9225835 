My question about this follows the paste.

<q>

What is pythagorean winning percentage?

Pythagorean winning percentage is an estimate of a team's winning
percentage given their runs scored and runs allowed. Developed by
Bill James, it can tell you when teams were a bit lucky or unlucky.
It is calculated by

(Runs Scored)^1.83
---------------------------------------------------------
(Runs Scored)^1.83 +  (Runs Allowed)^1.83

The traditional formula uses an exponent of two, but this has
proven to be a little more accurate.

</q>

The math is simple.

But what's the premise?
