The president of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) on Friday agreed to
ask his organisation's executive committee to overturn Togo's ban from the next
two Africa Cup of Nations.

Togo were punished by CAF for government interference after they pulled out of
this year's tournament in Angola in the aftermath of an attack on their team bus
that injured players and left two people dead.

The Togo Football Federation (TFF) filed an appeal against the decision with the
Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and the two parties met at the headquarters
of world governing body FIFA in Zurich to resolve the dispute.

During the meeting, CAF president Issa Hayatou agreed to ask his executive
committee to lift the sanction, after the TFF conceded that it had not informed
the CAF of its withdrawal from January's event in accordance with competition
regulations.

"I am very pleased that we have been able to find a solution which is
satisfactory for both parties," said FIFA president Sepp Blatter, who acted as a
mediator during the talks.

"Today marks a victory for the whole football family, particularly for African
football. This shows that we can solve internal disputes within the football
family for the benefit of all those who are involved in our game, and in
particular for the players."

The CAF executive committee are due to meet on May 15 to make a final decision
on the matter.

The initial decision to ban Togo sparked angry protests in the capital Lome,
with between 25,000 and 50,000 people taking to the streets to denounce
Hayatou's decision in February.
