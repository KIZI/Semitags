 Single-Payer in California? | Truthout 
 
 
First Vermont and now California. This is how it began in Canada.
 
 
That is the problem.

We have people who do medical care.

Drs, nurses, med techs, hospitals and the like.

Then we have people who make money off ot the hospitals and us for playing a risk game with the funds to pay these people, Insurance companies.

Insurance started out as a way to make it easier for people to afford the costs by spreading the cost with risk management.

Then that business became much more profitable than the healthcare business its self.

Now we are having costs raised by both.

They ONLY way to trim these costs is to allow people to spread the risk through insurance that does not seek a PROFIT but a fraction of the money to maintain the opperations.

That is called a public Option.

NOthing much changes except the private insurance can no longer gouge you or you will leave them for the Public Option program.

This is why the people who make bank off insuring people and kicking poeple who get sick off their risk plans have been spending butt loads of money to make people HATE the public option idea along with nay real reform.

I accepted your study and the site your study came from.

I will expect you to do the same with any study I produce from this same company.

I wish I could post this where I wanted but my account is still messed up and I got locked out of a thread I started again.

when I rtry to go to the thread it says I am nit allowed there.

I cant figure out what I am doing wrong to cuase this could someone help me figure it out?
 
 
Just another reason to NEVER, EVER step foot in California, either as a visitor or a resident.

What a friggin joke.... One plan is going to meet the needs of EVERY individual? I'm sure that everyone will be paying the same amount in terms of premiums too, right? Government mandated healthcare doesn't work here in Massachusetts. It's not going to work in Vermont, California, or on a national level either

Can you guys access my Unspeakable thread?

LMAO!! Great idea the State is already bankrupt.... I know let's spend even more
 
 
Can you guys give me any tips how to find out which mod knows best how to deal with these type of errors?

I am blocked out of several threads I started now and I cant tell what happened to them and dont know who to send a message to.

My God I hope not!!

We have to dump $15billion into romneycare every single year to keep that state afloat.

Two comments about your article:

A high percentage of Central Valley residents are on Medi-Cal.

I'm not surprised since liberals turned the water off in the Central Valley, causing 40,000 farmers to lose their income/land.

Organizations such as the California Chamber of Commerce and the Child and Family Protection Association strongly oppose the bill.

Gee. Do they hate children and families the same way Republicans do?

When will liberals grow a brain and figure out their policies do nothing but harm?

Premiums are going up for everyone because of Obamacare.

Brainless liberals.

BTW. Brown won't sign it either. CA is broke.

There's no way liberals are going to expect everyone to pay, so the working class will have to pay more so some don't have to.

In one sense you're correct. The devil is in the details. That stated, what we have now doesn't work.

The only argument offered by the naysayers (in the link provided by TM's), is Leno's bill is socialism. Currently our medical system is based on capitalism, which means profit is the first order of business, not the patient.

I can only point out history and what is currently going on.

Medicare goes over budget every year.

Romneycare requires federal fucnd (tax dollars] to keep from going under every year.

History tells me this will continue.

I do, however, hope that I am wrong. But, since the same people that get it wrong, time and again, are donig the same thing again....

The link failed to get more information on the down side of this. That's why it list it as socilism only.

Tell me this then. Since most of the countries that use this system, to save money, are going under much faster than we are. Why should we copy a failed system?

GOOD. All Business should be based on profit as the prime motivator. That's both common sense and basic business practice. What you people fail to recognize is that health care is NOT a right. It is a PRIVILEGE. It always has been and always will be. With increased income comes increased access to better medical care. With decreased income comes decreased access to medical care.

 
I don't understand. How will a system which is not focused on profit, as is the medical care system in America today, more costly than one which is non profit?

 

Right now there are a lot of people who don't get ANY medical care because they cannot afford it. Under plans like this, those people will be getting that care, dramatically increasing the amount spent on these plans. On the other side, businesses and individuals who do not like a single-plan, single payer system will be LEAVING the state, reducing the amount of income the plan gets and forcing the State to put more money into the system. Pretty simple equation if you ask me.
 
 
if you dont live in Cali why do you even care about this?

By removing most of the responsibility from employers to provide healthcare, it may well bring business back to California. The biggest problem in California though, is covering all the illegals. Remove them from the equation and costs would be reduced with any system of healthcare.

Because it's going to fail, and fail huge, and then CA will come begging and crying to Congress, and then the rest of us will have to pay for CA's liberal failure.

I'll assume you are talking to me.

Everything the government touches causes an increase in cost.

Get the government uninvolved, including the states and let it go from there.

How do I know this will work?

TX has the nations lowest premiums. Why? B/c every ins co is allowed to be there.

Competion brings down cost.

health care has been determined to be a right already. as you if you show up at a hospital and need care, they are required by law to treat you regardless of you ability to pay.

Luckily there are citizens, voters, who need to approve this. Right? No, wait, the legislature pretty much despises us voters.

Again, the devil is in the details. I don't know what is in the Leno bill.

In San Francisco a small percentage of your restaurant bill is added to provide insured benefits to City residents without healthcare. Yep, some are here illegally, but many include the waite staff and the working poor. Of course without this benefit an ill or injured person will always get treated in an emergency room, which I understand is a more costly form of treatment.

My wife and I had a snack in The City last week; the cost was $10.45 including a.20 cent tax for healthcare. No big deal. I get the slippery slope argument, and understand that when all taxes and fees are considered, we all pay a lot of money. Rather than focus on the initial cost, however, I focus on what these dollars provide. Is there a cost-benefit? I believe there generally is, though waste, fraud and abuse occurs too.

thats 5.5 times larges.

cali already spends $200 billion on HC. (per the article)

thats $5,555 per resident annually. or $462 per month. thats a pretty good premium per person if the state goes to single payer..

and please show me where it says the state would make the fed pay for these services? all it stated was the when the new federal law goes into affect that it could apply for a waivers and get federal funding mandated under the new law to help pay for services..

DirigoChoice in Maine.
...

 
In 2003, the state to great fanfare enacted its own version of universal health care. Democratic Governor John Baldacci signed the plan into law with a bevy of familiar promises. By 2009, it would cover all of Maine's approximately 128,000 uninsured citizens. System-wide controls on hospital and physician costs would hold down insurance premiums. There would be no tax increases. The program was going to provide insurance for everyone and save businesses and patients money at the same time.

After five years, fiscal realities as brutal as the waves that crash along Maine's famous coastline have hit the insurance plan. The system that was supposed to save money has cost taxpayers $155 million and is still rising.

Here's how the program was supposed to work. Two government programs would cover the uninsured. First the legislature greatly expanded MaineCare, the state's Medicaid program. Today Maine families with incomes of up to $44,000 a year are eligible; 22% of the population is now in Medicaid, roughly twice the national average.

Then the state created a "public option" known as DirigoChoice. (Dirigo is the state motto, meaning "I Lead.") This plan would compete with private plans such as Blue Cross. To entice lower income Mainers to enroll, it offered taxpayer-subsidized premiums. The plan's original funding source was $50 million of federal stimulus money the state got in 2003. Over time, the plan was to be "paid for by savings in the health-care system." This is precisely the promise of ObamaCare. Maine saved by squeezing payments to hospitals and physicians.

The program flew off track fast. At its peak in 2006, only about 15,000 people had enrolled in the DirigoChoice program. That number has dropped to below 10,000, according to the state's own reporting. About two-thirds of those who enrolled already had insurance, which they dropped in favor of the public option and its subsidies. Instead of 128,000 uninsured in the program today, the actual number is just 3,400. Despite the giant expansions in Maine's Medicaid program and the new, subsidized public choice option, the number of uninsured in the state today is only slightly lower that in 2004 when the program began.

Why did this happen? Among the biggest reasons is a severe adverse selection problem: The sickest, most expensive patients crowded into DirigoChoice, unbalancing its insurance pool and raising costs. That made it unattractive for healthier and lower-risk enrollees. And as a result, few low-income Mainers have been able to afford the premiums, even at subsidized rates.

This problem was exacerbated because since the early 1990s Maine has required insurers to adhere to community rating and guaranteed issue, which requires that insurers cover anyone who applies, regardless of their health condition and at a uniform premium. These rules—which are in the Obama plan—have relentlessly driven up insurance costs in Maine, especially for healthy people.

The Maine Heritage Policy Center, which has tracked the plan closely, points out that largely because of these insurance rules, a healthy male in Maine who is 30 and single pays a monthly premium of $762 in the individual market; next door in New Hampshire he pays $222 a month. The Granite State doesn't have community rating and guaranteed issue.

One proposal to get people into the DirigoChoice system is to reduce the premiums, presumably to give the uninsured a larger incentive to join. But that would explode the program's costs when it already can't pay its bills. A program that was supposed to save money by reducing health-care waste and inefficiencies has seen a 74% increase in premiums. But even those inflated payments can't keep the program out of the red.

Last year, DirigoCare was so desperate for cash that the legislature broke its original promise of no tax hikes and proposed an infusion of funds through a beer, wine and soda tax, similar to what has been floated to pay for the Obama plan. Maine voters rejected these taxes by two to one. Then this year the legislature passed a 2% tax on paid health insurance claims. Taxing paid insurance claims sounds a tad churlish, but the previous funding formula was so complicated that it was costing the state $1 million a year in lawsuits.

Unlike the federal government, Maine has a balanced budget requirement. So out of fiscal necessity, the state has now capped the enrollment in the program and allowed no new entrants. Now there is a waiting list. DirigoChoice has become yet another expensive, failed experiment in government-run health care, alongside similar fiascoes in Massachusetts and Tennessee.

Get the government out of healthcare entirely. Let those individuals who can afford healthcare get it and those who can't afford it.... well, TOUGH LUCK.

Almost as much chance of that as me voting for Obama in 2012.

 
health care has been determined to be a right already. as you if you show up at a hospital and need care, they are required by law to treat you regardless of you ability to pay.

 

Healthcare is NOT a right, regardless of what ANY piece of legislation or judicial decision may suggest. The fact that these facilities are forced to endure expenses without possibility of recouping their costs is a large part of what caused this problem in the first place.

 
if you read the article, it stated that California currently spends $200 billion a year treating the uninsured.

can you explain further how a non profit business is more costly to run than a for profit business? that makes no sense.

 

Very simple......

Costs will go UP because there will be more people getting more services. Individuals who currently pay NOTHING for their care (and who I'm sure will STILL pay NOTHING) will be more apt to partake of additional services that they currently are not partaking in.

Income into the system will go DOWN as companies and individuals who will be expected to pay a larger bill for their services (and to cover the services of the non-payers) leave the state for greener pastures.

That $200 Billion expense will probably go to $300 Billion as these non-payers stick their hands even further into the healthcare "cookie jar". Companies and businesses which are currently paying for the "cookies" will stop doing so. When there becomes a shortfall in the "cookies" available through the rates paid by those who are forced to pay for services, the government is going to have to make that difference up.

Let's assume that the $200 Billion even stays the same. You've currently got let's say $2 Trillion (pulling that number out of my ass) that is paid in premiums by the general public for their insurance plans. If we assume all that money now goes to funding this Cali-care plan instead, the plan has to soak up an additional 10% ($200 Billion) in expenses without adding even a single penny in income to maintain the same rates as our currently being paid. I don't think any of us are naive enough to believe that rates won't go UP. Then people leave, and the overall income to the plan decreases.

I don't understand. Business is run by people, and government is run by people. Both are at risk of going out of business - in effect losing their job. Mayors, governors, legislators, etc. can be recalled and face reelection on a regualr basis. Government, by law, must be open to the public, not so a private business.
 
 
And those suckers as you call them pay a huge amount of the countries taxes.

There are no examples of it working in real life though.
 
 
 
 
Telll me why other countries can make these programs work yet you think Americans cant make them work?

 

They can't. That's just it. We have example after example of their failure and you want us to adopt them anyway.

 

Contrary to what one hears in political discourse, the bulk of the research comparing the United States and Canada found a higher quality of care in our northern neighbor. Canadians, for example, have longer survival times while undergoing renal dialysis and after a kidney transplant. Of 10 studies comparing the care given to a broad range of patients suffering from a diverse group of ailments, five favored Canada, three yielded mixed results, and only two favored the United States.

And those suckers as you call them pay a huge amount of the countries taxes.

 

Yes. Taxes for unConstitutional, immoral, and disgusting programs like Social Security, Medicare, unemployment, welfare, foreign aid, etc....

Imagine how much more money they could put in their pocket if they'd wise up and start refusing to pay for those illegal, immoral, and unConstitutional programs. Hell, it would probably be enough to pay their Starbucks bill for a month. Well, maybe not THAT much.  
 
 
 
 
This idea that non-profit is some how cheaper is nuts.

the governemnt always costs more than for profit companies. Why? B/c they have to worry about going out of business, while the governement doesnt'.

 

I don't understand. Business is run by people, and government is run by people. Both are at risk of going out of business - in effect losing their job. Mayors, governors, legislators, etc. can be recalled and face reelection on a regualr basis. Government, by law, must be open to the public, not so a private business.

 

The government can not go out of business. A state union employee must go out of their way to lose thier job.

a personal story;

I did csr work for a company that did Med Sup Part D in CA [ironically]. We had 250 - 300 totla csr. Each week we go 1-2 calls where the customer advised us that they were not dead. Medicare had declared them dead and cancelled thier insurance. Now we did what we could to help, and at the speed of government the got thier ins back in ~ 3 months, assuming they didn't die w/o thier meds in the mean time.

Now tell me you want the same people running ALL your health ins cradle to the grave.  
 
 
 
 
what do you see as a solution to these problems?

 

Get the government out of healthcare entirely. Let those individuals who can afford healthcare get it and those who can't afford it.... well, TOUGH LUCK.

id just like to point out that anachronism just told everyone who cant afford insurance, fuck you too bad.

Very simple......

Costs will go UP because there will be more people getting more services. Individuals who currently pay NOTHING for their care (and who I'm sure will STILL pay NOTHING) will be more apt to partake of additional services that they currently are not partaking in.

Income into the system will go DOWN as companies and individuals who will be expected to pay a larger bill for their services (and to cover the services of the non-payers) leave the state for greener pastures.

where did it say companies are footing the bill? this would be single payer, hence ever resident has to pay taxes to for services in the system.

That $200 Billion expense will probably go to $300 Billion as these non-payers stick their hands even further into the healthcare "cookie jar". Companies and businesses which are currently paying for the "cookies" will stop doing so. When there becomes a shortfall in the "cookies" available through the rates paid by those who are forced to pay for services, the government is going to have to make that difference up.

Let's assume that the $200 Billion even stays the same. You've currently got let's say $2 Trillion (pulling that number out of my ass) that is paid in premiums by the general public for their insurance plans. If we assume all that money now goes to funding this Cali-care plan instead, the plan has to soak up an additional 10% ($200 Billion) in expenses without adding even a single penny in income to maintain the same rates as our currently being paid. I don't think any of us are naive enough to believe that rates won't go UP. Then people leave, and the overall income to the plan decreases.

 

so because more people are paying for services, costs will go up. well yes...... that true, but since more people are paying for services the burden to the state goes down..... more money in from the plan holders (i.e. by paying taxes that go towards the system) = less money needed from the state.

The Govt is always backed by the tax dollar. They can't go out of business.

Private companies can.
 
 
 
 
 
What if it works?

 

History suggests it won't. TennCare failed. MassCare failed.

 

DirigoChoice in Maine.
...

 
In 2003, the state to great fanfare enacted its own version of universal health care. Democratic Governor John Baldacci signed the plan into law with a bevy of familiar promises. By 2009, it would cover all of Maine's approximately 128,000 uninsured citizens. System-wide controls on hospital and physician costs would hold down insurance premiums. There would be no tax increases. The program was going to provide insurance for everyone and save businesses and patients money at the same time.

After five years, fiscal realities as brutal as the waves that crash along Maine's famous coastline have hit the insurance plan. The system that was supposed to save money has cost taxpayers $155 million and is still rising.

Here's how the program was supposed to work. Two government programs would cover the uninsured. First the legislature greatly expanded MaineCare, the state's Medicaid program. Today Maine families with incomes of up to $44,000 a year are eligible; 22% of the population is now in Medicaid, roughly twice the national average.

Then the state created a "public option" known as DirigoChoice. (Dirigo is the state motto, meaning "I Lead.") This plan would compete with private plans such as Blue Cross. To entice lower income Mainers to enroll, it offered taxpayer-subsidized premiums. The plan's original funding source was $50 million of federal stimulus money the state got in 2003. Over time, the plan was to be "paid for by savings in the health-care system." This is precisely the promise of ObamaCare. Maine saved by squeezing payments to hospitals and physicians.

The program flew off track fast. At its peak in 2006, only about 15,000 people had enrolled in the DirigoChoice program. That number has dropped to below 10,000, according to the state's own reporting. About two-thirds of those who enrolled already had insurance, which they dropped in favor of the public option and its subsidies. Instead of 128,000 uninsured in the program today, the actual number is just 3,400. Despite the giant expansions in Maine's Medicaid program and the new, subsidized public choice option, the number of uninsured in the state today is only slightly lower that in 2004 when the program began.

Why did this happen? Among the biggest reasons is a severe adverse selection problem: The sickest, most expensive patients crowded into DirigoChoice, unbalancing its insurance pool and raising costs. That made it unattractive for healthier and lower-risk enrollees. And as a result, few low-income Mainers have been able to afford the premiums, even at subsidized rates.

This problem was exacerbated because since the early 1990s Maine has required insurers to adhere to community rating and guaranteed issue, which requires that insurers cover anyone who applies, regardless of their health condition and at a uniform premium. These ruleswhich are in the Obama planhave relentlessly driven up insurance costs in Maine, especially for healthy people.

The Maine Heritage Policy Center, which has tracked the plan closely, points out that largely because of these insurance rules, a healthy male in Maine who is 30 and single pays a monthly premium of $762 in the individual market; next door in New Hampshire he pays $222 a month. The Granite State doesn't have community rating and guaranteed issue.

One proposal to get people into the DirigoChoice system is to reduce the premiums, presumably to give the uninsured a larger incentive to join. But that would explode the program's costs when it already can't pay its bills. A program that was supposed to save money by reducing health-care waste and inefficiencies has seen a 74% increase in premiums. But even those inflated payments can't keep the program out of the red.

Last year, DirigoCare was so desperate for cash that the legislature broke its original promise of no tax hikes and proposed an infusion of funds through a beer, wine and soda tax, similar to what has been floated to pay for the Obama plan. Maine voters rejected these taxes by two to one. Then this year the legislature passed a 2% tax on paid health insurance claims. Taxing paid insurance claims sounds a tad churlish, but the previous funding formula was so complicated that it was costing the state $1 million a year in lawsuits.

Unlike the federal government, Maine has a balanced budget requirement. So out of fiscal necessity, the state has now capped the enrollment in the program and allowed no new entrants. Now there is a waiting list. DirigoChoice has become yet another expensive, failed experiment in government-run health care, alongside similar fiascoes in Massachusetts and Tennessee.

Are you suggesting similar problems don't occur in the private sector?

My point was policy makers - not clerks - would lose their jobs; policy makers do when they fail to perform. It happens every election, incumbents lose and others take their place, some even are recalled. In effect a new government replaces the old, tantamount to how new businesses spring up when others fail.

These plans can't work. How many States have tried and how many work as they are advertised?? They are full of Unintended Consequences.

Those who can buy premiums end up having to pay more to cover the costs of those who can't pay. I don't know about you but I'm not interested in paying anyones HC costs anymore than I want to pay the mortgage, rent or send their kids to college.

Obamacare will be the same damnend thing.

Sure hope the SC finds that clusterfuck unconstitutional because if it doesn't anyone who can pay is going to the poorhouse.

Yes. Yes, I did.

 
where did it say companies are footing the bill? this would be single payer, hence ever resident has to pay taxes to for services in the system.

 

Even better. Now, rather than paying a percentage of my healthcare expense (20-35%) through my employer, I'm going to be paying 100% of it PLUS the cost of the lazy, worthless sacks of shit who don't pay any taxes to begin with. This just keeps getting better and better.

So rather than paying $25 (20%) a week to my employer, I'll be paying 100% ($125 a week, $6500 a year) of my own bill, plus probably another 50% (at least) of someone else's. Gee, I'd really like to pay $10,000 a year for my (and someone else's) health care rather than paying $1300 a year for just mine. NO THANKS.

 
so because more people are paying for services, costs will go up. well yes...... that true, but since more people are paying for services the burden to the state goes down..... more money in from the plan holders (i.e. by paying taxes that go towards the system) = less money needed from the state.

 

More people will NOT be paying into the system. I have a very hard time believing that the lower tax bracket people will be forced to pay their fair share in this. As always the burden will end up on the middle and upper income brackets to pay for the worthless wastes of flesh and oxygen in the lower brackets.

haha im not the one who told every american if you cant afford health insurance, well tough luck. or did you miss that post? i bet he couldnt afford insurance without his employer paying the majority of it. he should get what he deserves for not caring about anyone but himself.

my employer helps pay my premium and i feel lucky that he does. i dont tell everyone else to fuck off and its too bad that he pays for some of it and they cant afford it. i could still afford health care if he didnt pay a portion. if that were the case am i suppose to demoize those who get it subsidized through their employer. wake up and think about someone else besides yourself for once in your life.
 
 
Wait till the premiums on he and his family go through the roof and he's headed for the poorhouse along with anyone else who can pay.

I'm sure he'll head there happily knowing he's footing the bills for the freeloaders.

please point me out to where it says that you are going to loose the ability to purchase that exact same plan on the open market? youre just gonna have to go a different route to get that plan instead of taking the charity of your employer.
 
 
 
 
 
glad to see your company is footing the bill. i hope they eliminate your benefits because costs get too high and then you cant afford HC. then you become part of the millions of uninsured and, actually that would be like saying fuck you to yourself!  

 

Wow. You are psycho.

Did you know that the latest estimate is that 30% of employers will discontinue coverage starting 2014 because of Obamacare.

That is 10s of millions of people.

Perhaps you can have a celebratory party.

A bigger effect than expected

 
As we have seen, a Congressional Budget Office report estimated that only 9 million to 10 million people, or about 7 percent of employees, currently covered by ESI would have to switch to subsidized exchange policies in 2014. Most surveys of employers likewise show relatively low interest in shifting employees from traditional ESI.

Our survey found, however, that 45 to 50 percent of employers say they will definitely or probably pursue alternatives to ESI in the years after 2014. Those alternatives include dropping coverage, offering it through a defined-contribution model, or in effect offering it only to certain employees. More than 30 percent of employers overall, and 28 percent of large ones, say they will definitely or probably drop coverage after 2014.

I'm a Union employee of a private company so those benefits aren't going anywhere.

Oh, and I HAVE paid 100% of my healthcare plan in the past, when I worked as a contractor; so I have been down that road, thank you very much. Not the most pleasant experience, but I made sure that the money was there for it, because I do need the insurance. Even when it meant that a bunch of the things I would have liked to have or do had to be put on the back burner in order to afford it.

haha im not the one who told every american if you cant afford health insurance, well tough luck. or did you miss that post? i bet he couldnt afford insurance without his employer paying the majority of it. he should get what he deserves for not caring about anyone but himself.

my employer helps pay my premium and i feel lucky that he does. i dont tell everyone else to fuck off and its too bad that he pays for some of it and they cant afford it. i could still afford health care if he didnt pay a portion. if that were the case am i suppose to demoize those who get it subsidized through their employer. wake up and think about someone else besides yourself for once in your life.

 

So the ultimate plan was always universal suffering and lack of healthcare for all?

Thanks for clearing that up. More of class warfare that liberals think benefits the country somehow and makes us a greater nation.

You got what you wanted. You should have a party.
 
 
 
 
what do you see as a solution to these problems?

 

I'll assume you are talking to me.

Everything the government touches causes an increase in cost.

Get the government uninvolved, including the states and let it go from there.

How do I know this will work?

TX has the nations lowest premiums. Why? B/c every ins co is allowed to be there.

Competion brings down cost.

 

Texas also has the highest percentage of uninsured, leading the nation at close to 27%. This basically tells us that insurance companies that operate in Texas have been successful at keeping those at the highest risk from being insured, thereby reducing the costs for everyone else. If your answer to lower premiums is keeping more people uninsured, then Texas is a great example of how to do it.

 Uninsured: Highest Percentage in Texas, Lowest in Mass.

so tell me, do i get to say fuck you, too bad. if they cut your benefits and you can no longer afford health insurance?

You pay to support romneycare now and you will pay to support calicare.
 
 
 
 
 
This idea that non-profit is some how cheaper is nuts.

the governemnt always costs more than for profit companies. Why? B/c they have to worry about going out of business, while the governement doesnt'.

 

I don't understand. Business is run by people, and government is run by people. Both are at risk of going out of business - in effect losing their job. Mayors, governors, legislators, etc. can be recalled and face reelection on a regualr basis. Government, by law, must be open to the public, not so a private business.

 

The Govt is always backed by the tax dollar. They can't go out of business.

Private companies can.

 

Governments fail, see Greece. Rarely do they disappear, but can and do devolve into chaos.

But the argument that government costs more because it can't go out of business suggests deficit spending is legal, which it is not. By law (to my knowledge) all states and their sub-divisions need to have a balanced budget. This can be done by raising revenue, generally raising taxes, or by cutting services, or some combination. However, by tricks an subterfuge policy makers have been able to kick the can down the road; they've been doing so in California for decades.

Gov. Brown said "Enough"; time will tell if he can bring order to chaos. As I watch the process I suspect Gov. Brown will cut, cut and cut some more, allowing the Republcan Party to achieve its goal to shrink government to the size it can be drowned in a bathtup.

In effect Brown maybe taking an ends and means strategy, for reason has not prevailed. No Republican is willing to compromse on new taxes, and too few are willing to allow an extension of others. While President Obama seeks to achieve compromise with the Republcans, Brown seems willing to allow Republicans to be responsible for the result. I suspect Brown is betting the people will reject the world as imagined by Grover Norquist, and reject the current members of the legislature for their refusal to allow the tax issues to be decided by the voter. If the California election of 2010 was a foreshadowing for 2012, the next tsunami will damage the GOP as badly as Watergate.

Romenycare is supported by medicaid (but only 20%), which the government program for the poor. which coincidentally was already helping pay for the uninsured.

since i already am taxed to support medicaid it doesnt make any difference to me. my taxes havent increased for a service i am not using.
 
 
Fvck, I am taxed enough already and on the verge of going back to Texas. Businesses, upper-class and middle upper-class are fleeing the state already. Wait till they see what happens is single payer goes through.
 
 
this is the main failure of Romney care:

It’s important to note that the subsidies in Massachusetts are extensive and reach well into the middle class-available on a sliding scale to those with incomes up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level. That means subsidies would be available for those with incomes ranging from $30,480 for a single individual to as much as $130,389 for a married couple with seven children. A typical married couple with two children would qualify for a subsidy if their income were below $63,000.

and this

According to insurance industry insiders, the plans are too costly for the target market, and the potential customers- largely younger, healthy men-have resisted buying them. Those who have signed up have been disproportionately older and less healthy. This should come as no surprise since Massachusetts maintains a modified form of community rating, which forces younger and healthier individuals to pay higher premiums in order to subsidize premiums for the old and sick.

between half and two-thirds of those uninsured before the plan was implemented remain so. That’s a far cry from universal coverage. In fact, whatever progress has been made toward reducing the ranks of the uninsured appears to be almost solely the result of the subsidies. The much ballyhooed mandate itself appears to have had almost no impact.

people still werent paying into the system.
 
 
 
Fvck, I am taxed enough already and on the verge of going back to Texas. Businesses, upper-class and middle upper-class are fleeing the state already. Wait till they see what happens is single payer goes through.

 

go back to texas, you can be part of the 27% of the uninsured there.

How many of those are illegals, and how many chose not to be covered?

 

I'm sure a good percentage are illegals. However, I'm also sure that a great many of them are those with pre-existing conditions that have been denied coverage, and now due to their illnesses can no longer afford coverage even if it were available. When you actually become sick and see what the insurance companies will do to force you out, you might then understand why our system is in such a mess. It's easy to tell everyone how they need to be responsible for themselves, no matter how much the deck may be stacked against them, when you are healthy and employed. Get sick and lose your job, and all of a sudden you begin to understand what a nightmare health insurance can be. Even if you get back to work, unless your employer provides the insurance, you will be denied or forced to pay triple or quadruple the premium of everyone else, which very few can afford.
 
 
 
i bet he couldnt afford insurance without his employer paying the majority of it. he should get what he deserves for not caring about anyone but himself.

 

I have afforded insurance in the past, paying 100% of it myself, thank you very much.

 
wake up and think about someone else besides yourself for once in your life.

 

Sorry but my personal world revolves around ME and ME ALONE. The rest of you get to fend for yourselves, just as your society has left me to deal with my own problems.

please show me anyone with evidence who has had their employer cancel their insurance and cite the new health care law as evidence.

and again state where he / I lied.
 
 
 
so you just admitted your part of the one of those evil fascist unions? damn those are terrible things, are all conservatives against unions and collective bargaining? shouldnt you be rallying again unions and their power?

 

Unions are neither a panacea nor a horror. My job is unionized. I'm either part of the Union or I don't have a job. Pretty simple choice there. I've been on both sides of the fence and they both have their positive and negative points. That's all I'm going to say on that issue.

 
so tell me, do i get to say fuck you, too bad. if they cut your benefits and you can no longer afford health insurance?

 

Personally, you can say whatever you want whenever you want about whatever you want. It makes no difference to me. The moment I start concerning myself with or caring about about what you or anyone else thinks or says about me, it's time for me to eat a bullet.

I gave you the link to the most recent survey. If you just want to ignore the failures of the three examples given where this has been attempted at a state level, you may do so. However, I am not going to waste my time providing evidence just so that you can get your square peg into a round hole.

You want it to work. You want certain outcomes.

Not going to happen. Perhaps if you really tried to analyze what people provide you, instead of holding the hard party line, you would come to more thoughtful conclusions.
 
 
Medical insurance works IN NO WAY like all other insurance companies.
Any insurance that allows everyone to go get any care they want and have it paid for is the problem.
Does your car insurance pay for tires and oil changes?
Does your homeowners pay for paint, new carpet and roof?
There are little if any free market forces at work in the health care industry today BECAUSE OF health insurance. Doing away with group health insurance, have individual policies only and charge large premiums for folks that want to include ordinary doctor visits will solve the problem.
Insurance companies are A THIRD PARTY. Anyone that runs their own business knows that when a third party, NOT THE CONSUMER, is paying the bill then the charges are always inflated and the costs skyrocket.
And that is the current system we have-BROKEN.
We need a return to free market capitalism in the health industry. What we have now is insurance company mandated. It works at 3 times what others pay for the same care in other countries.

several kinds of employee health insurance plans were now, officially, considered to be below standard. Some large corporations, like McDonald's, had been offering some of their employees a mini-med health insurance plan. At least some of these corporations decided that upgrading their current health plan to meet the new requirements was going to be too expensive. Instead, they were threatening to simply stop offering their employees any health insurance, whatsoever.

The result would be that a lot of Americans who were getting at least some health insurance coverage would suddenly have no health insurance at all. This group of people did not make enough income to be able to afford private, individual, health insurance. To prevent a situation where a lot of Americans suddenly would be without health insurance coverage, the federal government granted waivers to some of the large corporations who were making these threats. The waivers would allow the company to continue to offer it's employees substandard health insurance, for a limited time.

the federal government has granted 1,372 waivers to employers and to health plans in all 50 states. This covers less than 2% of the insurance market (to give you some perspective). The waivers protect more than 3.1 million Americans that would have lost their health insurance when the large corporations were planning on dropping their employee health plans.

The waivers are temporary. They will no longer be available in 2014, when two things are expected to happen. The health insurance exchanges are intended to be up and running in 2014. This will give Americans a way to locate a health insurance plan that they can afford. The other thing that will happen in 2014 is that the annual dollar limit, or cap, that insurance companies currently place on health care, will be banned.

This report came out this month. Perhaps you should broaden which news sources you access so that you can keep up on current information.

And you are right. Those tens of millions people dropped can get a lesser plan from the exchange. It'll be great for working Americans to pay out of pocket for the lesser coverage. It's only fair in a liberal utopia. I get that. I really do.
 
 
If Cali wants to vote this insanity in then let em.

Just don't let em come crying to the taxpayers of America to bail their asses out when it tanks.
 
 
 
 
CA's 25 billion dollars in the hole. Companies are leaving as fast as they can get packed up.

How the hell do those idiots think they're going to pay for this?

 

By removing most of the responsibility from employers to provide healthcare, it may well bring business back to California. The biggest problem in California though, is covering all the illegals. Remove them from the equation and costs would be reduced with any system of healthcare.

 

and you know thats not going to happen....not out here anyway....

The only argument offered by the naysayers (in the link provided by TM's), is Leno's bill is socialism. Currently our medical system is based on capitalism, which means profit is the first order of business, not the patient.

I don't understand. How will a system which is not focused on profit, as is the medical care system in America today, more costly than one which is non profit?
Please explain, Two Thumbs, with some detail how you have concluded the plan in Leno's bill will increase spending?

 

What are they going to pay for it with?

 

Do you have no concept of what single payer is?

Inglewood and Baldwin Park arent exactly the same. Inglewood is closer to South Central or Watts, and Baldwin Park is closer to West Covina / Covina.

Most of California is pretty safe, but just like any state it has its bad parts.
 
 
 
 
 
if you dont live in Cali why do you even care about this?

Yes. Taken a look at their books lately? Awful lot of red ink.

So tell me -- how will spending more of what they don't have benefit anyone?

its mandated through taxes, just like every other tax. i.e. state income tax, medicaid. you can then make up for an shortfalls when people file their state taxes. will some people fall through the crack... probably. but it is the only sure fire way to insure people actually pay.
 
 
Most people that I know have had their employers require that the employee contribute a greater amount toward medical benefits. My spouse and I both saw less on our paychecks starting last summer. There is much talk about "kissing $5 co-pays good-bye". At the grocery store last week I heard the two men behind the meat counter discussing new hires not even being offered benefits, but that the people already employed would be keeping theirs, thankfully.

I challenge those of you that think this is great to explain how this bill is helping the middle class working person.

Is it because a 27 year old grown person (that should be on their own and independent) can remain on their parents insurance, at a cost to other taxpayers? Is that really it?

And to add, there were simpler approaches to the problems that did/do exist.

If the government wanted to deal with those people specifically excluded from getting insurance because of pre-existing conditions (whatever that means) then they should have only addressed that issue.

They should have dealt with tort reform, interstate competition, etc.

Obamacare was just a power grab, as is the proposal by the Democrat in CA. Or it is possible is that the person in CA is just an idiot liberal ideologue that thinks that utopia is a real place.

by your argument you are advocating that the status quo is ok, and those who can not get benefits are S.O.L.

your argument has several flaw.

1) the new federal law says kids would be able to stay on their parent insurance until age 26. it used to be 23 while they are in school. should people by age 26 be more independent, probably, but should they be punished for not being able to afford health care due to the slow job market and stagnant wages? is that really their fault?

2) if you do not know how the pre-existing condition clause works you really need to educate yourself. you can be rated and insurable based on stupid things like having previously had gall bladder surgery, or being born with a disease, or even hurting you knee. and they did address this issue in the new health care bill.

3) the new health care law is not a power grab. if we had gone to single payer i could see your argument. but since the new law works within the private health care field, the majority of the power still rests in the hands of the private industry.

the only thing i agree with that you said is tort reform, that needs to be addressed.

can you point to specific sections of the new health care bill you are against? and then give reasons why?

(FYI id like to see the actual section of the law, not just well i heard or an opinion)

They should most definitely be punished for choosing career tracks that do not have any sort of short term viability. I have a friend whose son will be a Senior in High School next year. The son wants to go to college to major in medieval history and archeology. Both great fields, but neither one of them has much potential to make him a productive member of society right out of school. His parents are pushing for him to do more of a Secondary Education with a minor in medieval history type of track because teaching is actually a practical profession.

I've got a list of pre-existing conditions that would stretch down your arm. I've NEVER had an insurance company balk or complain about it. Not even when I changed insurance companies while in the midst of after-care for a surgery related to one of those conditions.

The entire CONCEPT is unconstitutional, Skynet. Please show me anywhere in the listed powers of Article I, Section 8 of the US Constitutiom there is ANY reference made to any form of medical care, hospitalization, or anything even vaguely of the sort.

As for the immorality of it.... Taking money from MY pocket in the form of additional taxes to pay to provide medical care to people I feel should not receive any is quite immoral and inappropriate so far as I'm concerned.
 
 
I think this proposal is faulty and has a snowballs chance in hell of ever passing. But I have no problem with individual States enacting various Health Care schemes. I can move to another state if I don't like it.

What part of my sentence "there were simpler approaches to the problems that did/do exist." makes you think that I suggest that? Are we going to have a partisan bickerfest? If so, I'm not interested.

 
1) the new federal law says kids would be able to stay on their parent insurance until age 26. it used to be 23 while they are in school. should people by age 26 be more independent, probably, but should they be punished for not being able to afford health care due to the slow job market and stagnant wages? is that really their fault?

 

26, 27. Same difference in my eyes. Regardless, are you suggesting that I should be punished for them not affording health care? What about their parents taking care of the children they brought into the world? And we can go back to the beginning of the argument, which is the irony. Small businesses will scale back and/or not hire about a certain number of employees to stay under the dreaded numbers where Obamacare becomes unaffordable. Perhaps places like McDonalds, which at this time have benefit plans, will drop them and pay the penalties. So, with Obamacare, the 26 year old which may have found a job now can't because people aren't hiring, or if they are, will not provide him benefits. But luckily (for whom I don't know) he can stay on his parents plan. Now, at this time, if I have the same plan as negligent parent A, then my premiums will go up so as to cover him, since his parents won't, and the businesses can't.

 
2) if you do not know how the pre-existing condition clause works you really need to educate yourself. you can be rated and insurable based on stupid things like having previously had gall bladder surgery, or being born with a disease, or even hurting you knee. and they did address this issue in the new health care bill.

 

I don't think that you should force an industry to do anything. That is my opinion. Why? Because what is going to happen? People will not buy insurance until they get sick. Why do you think that insurance companies are obligated for someone to walk in, plunk down a monthly payment of $400 and say, by the way, I need a kidney transplant. Get right on that. How long will industry last? (I know the answer, by the way, and so does Obama. Here is a link in which he says directly that the goal is single payer, and that this is all nonsense as we transition toward that goal. He wants/needs the private industry out of the way to move toward single-payer.)

  YouTube - &#x202a;SHOCK UNCOVERED: Obama IN HIS OWN WORDS saying His Health Care Plan will ELIMINATE private insurance&#x202c;&rlm; 

In my post, I made the suggestion that the government directly look at this population of individuals. Do they have a problem? Absolutely, and it needs to be addressed. However, forcing companies to take them is toxic. The only way for the company to stay afloat is to force the healthy people to pay monstrous premiums to cover the "uninsurable". Revisit my post early in the thread regarding Maine. That scenario absolutely sunk their program, and their premiums were many times greater than the neighboring states. How many healthy people (at least the smart ones) will drop their insurance until they get sick? Why wouldn't they? Do you hate insurance companies? Do you think that the government does anything well and efficiently?

 
3) the new health care law is not a power grab. if we had gone to single payer i could see your argument. but since the new law works within the private health care field, the majority of the power still rests in the hands of the private industry.

 

Rewatch the video. The goal is single payer. Wake up before it is too late.

 
can you point to specific sections of the new health care bill you are against? and then give reasons why?

 

I'm not going to revisit the bill right now. Just not in the mood, quite frankly. Also parts are being addressed and removed, such as the 1099 Provision, thanks to the action of the Republican-controlled house. The bill is over 2500+ long. I am not going line by line with you.

 
(FYI id like to see the actual section of the law, not just well i heard or an opinion)

 

I do a lot of reading, and base my opinions off of that. I am not sure what else you want me to present to you.

My energies are not going to the bill at this time, just getting conservatives elected/reelected as necessary as my hope is that Obama will be voted out next year and subsequently the bill will be repealed. If not, I would like to see the SCOTUS deem the bill unConstitutional because of the mandate.

You seem like you are willing to discuss the issue, which I appreciate. And I do understand that liberals are very idealistic. Nothing innately wrong with that, but the devil is in the details. This is not a 'let's help everyone', this is a 'let's control 1/6 of the economy'.

By the way, because liberals are always told that conservatives have no ideas by those in the media, here are the items on the GOP plate. Link here:

Yes. Taken a look at their books lately? Awful lot of red ink.

So tell me -- how will spending more of what they don't have benefit anyone?

 

And still California gives back to the Feds more than they take in. Just can't spin that can ya?

Everybody paying is how. All those uninsured that use emergency rooms, the most expensive health care imaginable, will be paying for their health care. They will be able to get preventative care which also lowers the cost.

Quite the opposite. Businesses will not have to provide health care to their employees. They will save considerable money in a state with a single payer health plan.

You make the mistake of thinking that means CA's economy is in good shape. It's not. They're  $26 billion in the hole .

They don't need to spend more money. That's insane.

No, they won't. Their premiums will be subsidized by people who make more money. You know, exactly the way Obamacare will do.

Do you really think bleeding-heart Californians will insist somebody making minimum wage buy his own insurance? Never happen. Damn the budget, full steam ahead!

A system that doesn't rely on employer-sponsored coverage is not single-payer, it's a system in which individuals buy their own insurance. On those occasions when conservatives bother to offer health reform proposals, they tend to favor eliminating the tax preference for employer-sponsored coverage to facilitate the transition away from employer-sponsored coverage because that's a very inefficient system. I'm guessing they recognize that a multi-payer system without employer-sponsored coverage is not only possible, it's preferable to what we have now.

The public option bits sprinkled through the clip are unrelated to this point and, ultimately, irrelevant, given that the public option doesn't exist. That said, Frank and Schakowsky's comments are more about political posturing and drawing the ideological battle lines (and wishful thinking) than they are the actual function a hypothetical public option would serve.

These examples make no sense. Massachusetts has a Connector full of private plans.

I haven't been in the system yet -- I'm still waiting for my disability determination. I'll reserve judgement.
 
 
How many of you here run their own businesses, pay their own health insurance and deal with the insurance companies negotiating the rates, coverages and terms?
How many of you pay over 30K a year in health coverage and employ others?
How many here have group coverage as a benefit?
Believe me, the current health care scenario in America we now operate under through purchasing health insurance through insurance companies is broken, unsustainable and operates under NO free market principles. And it has been this way for 30 years, as long as I have been in business.

 TennCareA Failure Of Politics, Not Policy: A Conversation With Gordon Bonnyman 

 Single payer in Cali? 

Your population is greater than Massachusetts', Tennessee's, and Maine's. It will fail even quicker than they did.

 

none of those systems is actually "single payer"

as i posted before, we currently spend $200 billion an health care as a state already covering those who dont pay into the system. its called a health care tax. i already pay $150+ a month for health care, i have not problem continuing to pay that. those who arent paying will start though either a monthly tax deduction or at the end of the year when they file taxes.
 
 
funny that they pretend what we have now works.

"Paying through a tax deduction". If they can't afford their premium, simply take it out of their paychecks. Brilliant. So then they have less money for rent/mortgage, utilities, and oh, yeah, food.

The poor will not be charged. Never happen. Others will pay for them.

Not as funny as you pretending that what has never worked somehow magically will.

and how exactly do you avoid paying taxes? well i guess you can if youre a corporation that makes billions every year.

Follow along with me. I'll type slowly.

Bob has a job. It doesn't pay much. By the time he's paid rent, utilities, gas, car insurance, and food, he doesn't have any money left. He doesn't have health insurance.

Suddenly, CalCare comes along and says Bob has to pay a premium. Bob says, "With what?" CalCare says, "Your paycheck", and starts deducting $150 every month.

What is Bob going to have to do without? Rent, utilities, gas, car insurance, or food?

Do you think CA is going to do that? No. It will be means tested. People making below a certain income will not be charged. Other people will pay his premium for him.

Just like Obamacare is set up to do.
 
 
 
 
(I know the answer, by the way, and so does Obama. Here is a link in which he says directly that the goal is single payer, and that this is all nonsense as we transition toward that goal. He wants/needs the private industry out of the way to move toward single-payer.)

 

A system that doesn't rely on employer-sponsored coverage is not single-payer, it's a system in which individuals buy their own insurance. On those occasions when conservatives bother to offer health reform proposals, they tend to favor eliminating the tax preference for employer-sponsored coverage to facilitate the transition away from employer-sponsored coverage because that's a very inefficient system. I'm guessing they recognize that a multi-payer system without employer-sponsored coverage is not only possible, it's preferable to what we have now.

The public option bits sprinkled through the clip are unrelated to this point and, ultimately, irrelevant, given that the public option doesn't exist. That said, Frank and Schakowsky's comments are more about political posturing and drawing the ideological battle lines (and wishful thinking) than they are the actual function a hypothetical public option would serve.

 

The point of that clip was to demonstrate what the ultimate goal is in the progressive agenda in regards to health care/insurance. It doesn't have to do with employer-provided benefits, but rather, that private insurance companies are an impediment to ultimately running the whole health insurance show. You can blindly call that posturing, but that is the goal. I can't believe that so many people dismiss what these people are telling you in regards to the goals that they seek.

And I didn't comment on the Aetna "boom" post, because that person posted a link that shows that insurance agencies are forced to reduce premiums on a very small group of individuals because of Obamacare. I have read elsewhere, although not going to hunt it down right now, that 10-12% will benefit. That means that 88%-90% will not benefit. Or stated another way, will be harmed.

But this is the progressive agenda. Wealth redistribution, the take over of much of the private industries for the revenue they generate.

And for whatever reason, liberals think that the government runs things efficiently...with all of the layers of bureaucratic nonsense that is always prevalent in every program.
 
 
 
 
 
its mandated through taxes, just like every other tax. i.e. state income tax, medicaid. you can then make up for an shortfalls when people file their state taxes. will some people fall through the crack... probably. but it is the only sure fire way to insure people actually pay.

 

  "Raise taxes". Good job. Drive MORE businesses and individuals out of the state.

 

Quite the opposite. Businesses will not have to provide health care to their employees. They will save considerable money in a state with a single payer health plan.

 

Many will not, and take the penalty if it is cheaper. Do you think that is a good thing?

Also, google small businesses and the impact of Obamacare.

I don't get how liberals think this is all funny or somehow something to cheer about.

i used my case in point that i pay $150, i did not set this is a actual price everyone will pay.

i have stated several times before that California currently pays over $200 billion annually to treat the uninsured. this current amount can be used to help subsidize those people under the poverty level.

paying something into the system is always better than paying nothing. the system thus prevent free loaders.

8.2 million people are estimated as uninsured in California, what is they all paid $50 a month. that would be $5 billion put into the system annually. i know 50 bucks, terrible idea.... isnt paying something better than paying nothing?

how much would you cut costs if you took the profits out of health care and had tort reform?

every other country in the world is single payer and it works. you rally against it before its even been tried and tested.

You do know there are three other states who have tried single-payer, right?

And that they all failed, right?

So what makes you think it'll work in CA?

 

Got any links to all these "failed" single payer state systems?

What will make it work in CA is our population. It works great in Japan.

 

Revenue generators are fleeing the state. One million have moved out to be replaced by those that require aid.

CA is walking a tight rope. If they don't turn it around, they will be further billions in the hole in providing welfare, etc. to the people that live in the state.
 
 
 
How many of you here run their own businesses, pay their own health insurance and deal with the insurance companies negotiating the rates, coverages and terms?
How many of you pay over 30K a year in health coverage and employ others?
How many here have group coverage as a benefit?
Believe me, the current health care scenario in America we now operate under through purchasing health insurance through insurance companies is broken, unsustainable and operates under NO free market principles. And it has been this way for 30 years, as long as I have been in business.

 

They should allow companies to sell across state lines.

Also to bring premiums down, what about the billions of dollars that are paid to lawyers in medical malpractice (often trumped up because we live in an era of entitlement and victimhood) is passed on to the insurance consumer? Why is no one going after them?

Why not make some easy/small significant changes instead of going all in with a 2500+ page bill?

The answer, they want the power of being in charge of this huge part of the economy.

Wow. You were able to find one of your threads. You must be happy. It's a good day for you.

Partisan talking point. Try and hold on to your credibility.

How much does the oil industry PAY in taxes each year? What percentage. I'll wait, and then you can tell me how they skate by.

how many times do i have to post this??? they are allowing them start selling across state lines under the new health care law.

PPACA Section 1333 requires the parent department of CMS, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to issue regulations governing the creation of health care choice compacts by July 1, 2013.

Starting Jan. 1, 2016, two or more states will be able to use a compact to allow qualified health plans based in the participating states to sell health insurance in all participating states.

Whether it will or will not be implemented is not my contention. It doesn't take 2500+ pages to state that one sentence, now does it?

Dood. Look at CA's budget today. They're obviously astoundingly incompetent when it comes to handling money.

Because the Trial Lawyer's Association pays Democrats a lot of money to leave them alone.
