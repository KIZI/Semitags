It's been a long time since I've paid any attention to the railway so
forgive me if this is Â in any way a stupid question.

What is Geoff Harrison-Mee up to these days?

I remember Mee kindly writing a letter to me back in 1994 as a
youngster - thought he was a nice chappy then although I have since
learned that he was not as popular as I believed.

Was he any good as a manager or was he really that bad?
