South Korea's largest institutional investor National Pension Service (NPS) is
planning to purchase a 23.4 percent stake in Colonial Pipeline, a U.S. oil
pipeline operator, the fund said Monday.

Seeking to take over the stake from Chevron Corp. through talks, the company
said it has not been picked as a preferred bidder yet.

The South Korean fund, however, has reportedly been the main bidder for,
according to media reports, and the bidding process will come to an end by the
end of the year.

With the bidding price estimated to be around 1 trillion won ( 800 million U.S.
dollars), the NPS will sharply expand its overseas investment in assessment from
the current level of 3.5 trillion won (3 billion U.S. dollars).

The NPS has recently diversified its investment portfolio by roaming into the
real asset market, including taking over the HSBC Main Building in London and
Sony Center in Berlin.
