At times during his first year as the 10th Roman Catholic
archbishop of New York, Timothy M. Dolan seemed to be everywhere at
once, like a presidential candidate with momentum in the early
primaries.

The crush of demands to see, hear and get slapped on the back by
him kept the new archbishop in moving vehicles much of the time, on
his way to national conferences, television appearances and
far-flung churches where parishioners stood in line for hours to
shake his hand and say the same thing, often in the same words:
that he -- a bearish, warm-blooded, tough-talking Midwesterner -- was
"a breath of fresh air."

Since his solemn inauguration ceremony one year ago Thursday,
Dolan, 60, has made no secret of his love for food and "brew"
(his word).

But Dolan has some less palatable duties ahead of him. The
recession has worsened a chronic budget squeeze in the archdiocese,
increased demand for its frayed web of social service programs and
added urgency to a long-planned realignment of resources. The
parishes and schools of the archdiocese needed an added $30 million
infusion from headquarters in fiscal 2009 to meet expenses,
officials said.

In the past year, the archbishop has earned the affection of
many priests who bristled under the sometimes peremptory style of
his predecessor, Cardinal Edward M. Egan. Dolan also has won over
many parishioners, by restoring the archdiocesan pastoral council,
a lay advisory group that was moribund for years.

On the other hand, the archbishop has yet to deliver a major
sermon or speech on immigration issues -- to the chagrin of
advocates for Latino immigrants in New York, who make up the
church's fastest-growing population.

As archbishop of Milwaukee, where he served from 2002 until his
appointment in New York, he was praised there for revitalizing the
morale of parishioners and priests after a sexual abuse scandal
during the tenure of his predecessor, Archbishop Rembert G.
Weakland. But he was criticized by some, including many victims of
abuse, for having largely left Weakland's bishop-administrators in
place.

Joseph Zwilling, the spokesman for the New York Archdiocese,
said Dolan's decision to retain most of Egan's administrators so
far reflects his predecessor's "excellent choice of staff," as
well as the realities of being a newcomer taking charge of an
ecclesiastical territory that spans Manhattan, the Bronx, Staten
Island and seven upstate counties.

"He has spent the better part of the year getting to know his
way around," Zwilling said.
