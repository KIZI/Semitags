Who didn't make the list but should have?
 
 
What the fuck are the 93 Knicks doing on that list?

It's literally the last time anyone had any reason to watch the Knick play!
 
 
The 2007 Patriots are certainly ranked a lot higher than I thought.
 
 
Why aren't the 07 Pats Number #1? Who makes these stupid lists?

17-1*
 
 
Oh good! The New York Yankees made the list and they were above the Pats!
 
 
I hate any team that doesn't send me a check!
 
 
I hated the 1979 pirates with that "We are Fam-i-lee" nonsense
 
 
 
Tom Brady emerged from his protective casing and barked: "You don't talk about our team." They were the best organization in the league, and in 2007, it became clear they were also the most hypocritical. For all their policing of opposing players and coaches, it turned out that the Patriots were the ones breaking actual rules. Staff members were caught illegally videotaping opponent's signals, drawing the interest of Congress. Safety Rodney Harrison was busted for performance-enhancing drugs. Coach Bill Belichick (pictured) responded to the criticism by running up scores as if he were in the BCS. He made it undefeated to the Super Bowl, where karma and the Giants finally caught up to him

 

       

Classic!  
 
 
The '79 Pittsburgh Pirates, but that's personal. ;-)
 
 
For Me its the Yankees from 1996 on, but its personal.

As a Mets fan I always say I have no issue with the Yankees as a franchise and an organization, Most of their fans, however can rot in hell and suck Lucifer's Dick.
 
 
Any Oklahoma Sooner football team from 1970 to 1989, but that's personal.
 
 
 
I hated the 1979 pirates with that "We are Fam-i-lee" nonsense

 

Don't, please don't, make me neg rep you! Take it back before Willie Stargell haunts your very soul, as he rightly should.
 
 
 
The '79 Pittsburgh Pirates, but that's personal. ;-)

 

Orioles fan, huh? I feel your pain. I was a senior in college when my beloved Pirates last won a World Series. I've gone from young man to middle aged curmudgeon watching the Pirates long slide into irrelevance. I am heartened to find the only team in MLB this year to suck worse than the Bucs are the Orioles!

Don't forget those poor Kansas City Fans! When the hell was the last time THAT team was relevent?

Seventeen. Seventeen consecutive seasons losing more games than won. And they're working hard on the eighteenth consecutive season even as I type this.

Yes. The Pirates have finished below.500 for seventeen years in a row. they are currently 29 games below.500.

Don't cry Kansas City to me! The Pirates hold the record for most consecutive seasons with a losing record.
 
 
 
 
I hated the 1979 pirates with that "We are Fam-i-lee" nonsense

 

Don't, please don't, make me neg rep you! Take it back before Willie Stargell haunts your very soul, as he rightly should.

 

PoPs was a great player and an all time nice guy

What I hated about that Series

- ABC covered it and played the "We are Family" until you puked
- Howard Cosell was the lead commentator
- The stupid Pirate wives kept blowing their stupid whistles
 
 
And Dave Parker's performance in the 79 All Star Game should be a Must See for any aspiring outfielder.

So...we can say that you do NOT hate the 1979 Pirates. you hate ABC Sports, Howard Cosell and the director who kept cutting to the wives box at Three Rivers.

Way to avoid the wrath of Stargell!

Bob Prince (The Gunner), sainted Pirates announcer from the 1950s, 60s and 70s used to say that Willie Stargell's Fried Chicken restaurant located in The Hill district here in Pittsburgh would give free chicken to anyone in line whenever Pops slugged a home run. "Spread some chicken on the Hill!" was the battle cry. Prince also coined the phrase "green weenie" (a sticker Pirates fans would affix to the airplanes of visiting teams to put the hex on them) "home run in an elevator shaft" to describe a high pop up and he called Roberto Clemente "Bobby" much to Roberto's consternation.

I only mention Prince in response to your criticism of Cosell who I found pompous and tedious except where Muhammad Ali was concerned.

Cosell hated Baseball (Except for Jackie Robinson, who he reminded everyone was his good friend) he considered it below him

I used to like the Pirates in the 60s with Clemente and the Alou brothers

Yeah! Matty, Felipe and Jesus! I was always a big Manny Sanguillen fan myself. The Smilin' Panamanian, number 35 on your scorecard, number 1 in your heart.
 
 
The 1960-2009 Dallas Cowboys.
 
 
the Miami heat should be #1.
 
 
I love how they talk about the 07 Patriots, but don't mention how the Patriots were the most loved team just a few years prior. Fans are fickle.

Love em or hate em, the Patriots owned professional football for the last decade.
 
 
 
For Me its the Yankees from 1996 on, but its personal.

As a Mets fan I always say I have no issue with the Yankees as a franchise and an organization, Most of their fans, however can rot in hell and suck Lucifer's Dick.

 

Please.

You mets fans are a bunch of fucking douche bags.

You come to citizens bank park and ruin it for the families who are just out trying to have a nice day with their kids.

I've never seen a bigger bunch of foul mouthed pieces of mother fucking shit in my life.  
 
 
the U-12 denzlingen swim team. for personal reasons, obviously.

 25 most hated teams in sports history - More Sports - SI.com 

Who didn't make the list but should have?

 

 

The Faiders should always be the most hated.

Sorry about Jack Tatum dying lst week....but their motto "Commitment To Excrement" is classic.

The Silver and Black has always been hated because of their rough play and their fans most of all. They haven't won a Super Bowl since 1984 but their fans act like they're returning champions every year.

I was there in Jack Murphy Stadium in 78' when they fumbled their way to victory against the San Diego Chargers.   Seemed the only people in the stadium that new what they had just witnessed was illegal was the officials.  

Later as we were leaving the place I overheard some dip-shit Faider fan proclaiming... "Now They Know Our Secret Weapon"

Yup.....cheating is a great weapon....Libs do it every day. They should be Faider fans.

Orioles fan, huh? I feel your pain. I was a senior in college when my beloved Pirates last won a World Series. I've gone from young man to middle aged curmudgeon watching the Pirates long slide into irrelevance. I am heartened to find the only team in MLB this year to suck worse than the Bucs are the Orioles!

 

But at least we won in '83!
 
 
 
The 1960-2009 Dallas Cowboys.

 

Commie.

yeah. And the Pirates threatened in the early 90s. Andy VanSlyke, Bobby Bonilla, Barry Bonds? Where are ye?
