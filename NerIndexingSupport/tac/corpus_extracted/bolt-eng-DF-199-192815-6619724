North Korean leader Kim Jong-il dead
Updated December 19, 2011 14:50:29/ABC news online

 

North Korean leader Kim Jong-il has died of a heart attack, a tearful state television announcer dressed in black reported.

She said that the 69-year-old "passed away from a great mental and physical strain" while on a train trip, on his way to give "field guidance".

The news agency said he died at 8:30am on Saturday (local time) of a "severe myocardial infarction along with a heart attack".

An autopsy was performed on Sunday and a funeral is slated for December 28 the agency said.

Known at home as "the Dear Leader", Kim took over North Korea in 1994 when his father and founder of the reclusive state Kim Il-sung, known as "the Great Leader", died.

The state news agency called on North Koreans to follow Kim's son and designated successor, Kim Jong-un.

"All party members, military men and the public should faithfully follow the leadership of comrade Kim Jong-un and protect and further strengthen the unified front of the party, military and the public," state television said.

Kim suffered a stroke in August 2008 which left him with impaired movement in his left arm and leg.

The reclusive state had already begun the process of transferring power to Kim Jong-un, believed to be in his late 20s.

Images broadcast on North Korean television showed people crying on the streets of the capital Pyongyang after they heard the news.

The North has declared a period of national mourning from December 17 to 29.

Meanwhile, South Korea's Yonhap news agency says the South's military has been put on emergency alert.

The presidential Blue House has called an emergency National Security Council meeting, Yonhap said.

North and South Korea have remained technically at war since the three-year Korean conflict ended only in an armistice in 1953.

@msolga,

What will Kim Jong-il's death mean for North Korea & South Korea?
 
 
I am hoping his successor has a bit more sense, but I doubt it.
 
 
@edgarblythe,

Amen to that, edgar.

I am hoping (perhaps somewhat unrealistically) that the next leader pays a damn sight more attention to the ordinary people of North Korea. Boring, mundane things (compared to the "dear leader's" concerns) like health, enough food in peoples' stomaches. That would make for a very positive change!
 
 
@msolga,

Good.
 
 
@msolga,

 
According to the United Nations, one third of all children under the age of five in North Korea are malnourished, and other countries have become less interested in donating food as the "hermit kingdom" battles efforts to constrain its nuclear program.

The UN World Food Programme says public distributions are running extremely low, and they are only able to help half the people who need aid. Meanwhile, the countries rulers stage outsized military parades, and some wonder whether food donations are being siphoned off to them.....

@msolga,

I hope there's someone comparatively sensible in a position to take over. The world doesn't need more of a mess in North Korea.
 
 
From the Wall Street Journal....
Focusing (not too surprisingly) on the economic impact of Kim Jong-il's death, on stock market slides, currency devaluations, etc...

 
....The death of the dictator however, presents a new level of unknowns politically, economically and militarily for the region and the world. Bordering China and Russia and short missile ride to Japan, nuclear-armed North Korea sits at the nexus of global interests. Unrest or disintegration of the regime would have large impacts on its neighbors, especially South Korea.

Consider that military analysts figure 300,000 troops would be needed to keep North Korea calm should the regime fall apart.

South Korean government financial officials were on high alert, making statements within minutes of the death announcement that that they were monitoring foreign exchange transactions and financial markets, a signal they will intervene if necessary to prevent too much volatility.

Kim Jong Il’ death, and the apparent appointment of his 20-something son Kim Jong Un as his successor, opens a new chapter and what it means for South Korea’s economy is unknown. South Korea has prepared for years for the collapse, knowing it will likely cost the South hundreds of billions of dollars to reconstruct the North, should unification ever come into play.

@msolga,

just listening to CNN.
a commentator states that a succession process is underway, and that one should expect no major changes. he further claims that the military and the party have already had a great deal of influence over the policies announced by " the dear leader ".
the commentator compares the north-korean government to some of the islamic governments.
he cautions the west NOT to over-react and perhaps further isolate north-korea.
 
 
I think that the dynasty was greatly weakened when they changed the currency dec 09. That effort was aimed at hurting speculators but mostly what it did was rub out decades of savings by regular people, as they were only allowed to convert $40 worth of old currency into new. The end result was the leadership breaking faith with the people. Plus the kid is rumored to be an idiot. I am seriously worried about how this goes long term.
 
 
 
'Young general' tipped to lead North Korea
Updated December 19, 2011 15:37:43/ABC news online

 
Kim Jong-un Photo: Not much is known about Kim Jong-un - not even his age (Reuters)

Young and inexperienced, Kim Jong-un is seen as poised to take over North Korea with the death of his father, and extend the Kim dynasty's rule over the reclusive state for a third generation.

Not much is known about the younger Kim - not even his age. But his father Kim Jong-il and his autocratic regime had begun making preparations for the son's transition to power.

Thought to be aged around 27, Kim Jong-un had already been made a four-star general and occupied a prominent political post when he was reported to have made an important diplomatic visit to neighbouring China in May this year.

On the trip, he introduced himself to the destitute North's main benefactor, possibly one of the most crucial diplomatic moves he will ever make.

"The rest of the world is going to have to look at someone who is basically a kid as having China's support to be the North's next leader," Yang Moo-min, of Seoul's University of North Korean Studies, said at the time.

The youngest of the leader's three sons, Kim was most likely born in 1984. His name in Chinese characters translates as "righteous cloud" while the media calls him "the young general".

Educated in Switzerland, he is thought to speak English and German, and bears a striking resemblance to his grandfather, the North's founder, Kim Il-sung.

Analysts say two attacks on the peninsula last year, which killed 50 South Koreans, were aimed at winning the army's support for a continuation of dynastic rule and underscored an intent to maintain the state's military-first policy.

Experts say the young Kim is likely to follow the same militaristic path, maintaining a strong grip over one of the world's largest armies and pressing on with a nuclear weapons program in the face of international outrage....<cont>

BBC video report on Kim Jong-il's life & death:
19 December 2011 Last updated at 04:07 GMT Help

North Korean television has announced the death of Kim Jong-il, who has led the communist nation since the death of his father in 1994.

He suffered a stroke in 2008 and was absent from public view for months.

His designated successor is believed to be his third son, Kim Jong-un, who is thought to be in his late 20s.

Boring, mundane things (compared to the "dear leader's" concerns) like health, enough food in peoples' stomaches. That would make for a very positive change!

 

I hope that there will be no "next leader" in the sense and tradition of the uncrowned dynasty created by Kim Ill Sung - in the grotesque fiction that they (and their party apparatus) somehow represent the will of the people.

The people of North Korea need real freedom (not the attention of a benign despot) and the ability to direct their own lives. That will solve their economic problems as well.

Sadly the successor has already been named and, barring a palace coup, is likely to follow in the established tradition as Edgar suggested.
 
 
@georgeob1,

I doubt anyone here would disagree with that, George.
 
 
Meet the new boss. Same as the old boss.
 
 
@hawkeye10,

An idiot? Kind of like Dubyah?
 
 
The news over here for the past year about Baby Kim has been about how he was quickly promoted to 4-star general and so forth, despite having no experience in military or just about any other type of leadership. There was also an unverified report that he personally ordered the shelling of Yeongpyeong Island last year as a show of strength to the military brass.

I don't think he'll have real free reign for a little while yet. If he really does have some sort of reform in mind, I doubt it will show for a while yet. Maybe in a year, but that's just a guess. Who can guess what goes on behind closed doors on the other side of the DMZ?
 
 
@Ragman,

 
An idiot? Kind of like Dubyah?

 

wicked burn... topical too.
 
 
What is it that South Korea & Japan are fearing could now happen?

A show of military strength from the new North Korean leader against South Korea?

With the support of the Chinese & Russian governments?

How likely is that, do you think?

 
The death of Kim Jong-il has sent shockwaves through Asia, with South Korea and Japan calling emergency meetings....

....South Korean president Lee Myung-bak has called for calm and placed the military on emergency alert.

"President Lee urged the public to go about their usual economic activities without turbulence," a senior presidential official told a televised news conference.

Foreign ministry spokesman Chung Min Lee says South Korea is not looking for a fight with its northern neighbour.

"We also want to send a very strong signal to the Chinese and the Russians that none of us here in South Korea want to exploit this particular situation," he said.

"I think this is something all of us here have been thinking about very carefully for the last couple of years."....

This might be the only time I've seen one of these obituary headlines and thought "oh, awesome."

That's just the initial reaction though, of course the replacement matters, a lot. And this replacement doesn't look that encouraging.

Except for the use of the horrible word awesome, which I replaced with 'wonderful news!', these were my thoughts. I immediately began wondering what and who is next. Will it be better, more of the same or will it be worse? So far it isn't looking too good; there are often surprises though. Maybe the replacement has been playing along with his father all this time as a way to secure the top spot and bring forth forward a positive change.
 
 
@Sturgis,

a/t CNN, japan has already sent condolences on the death of " the dear leader ".
no doubt other countries will do the same.
it'll be interesting to see which countries will NOT sent condolences.

Japan calls emergency security meeting after Kim's death

Politics Dec. 19, 2011 - 07:30PM JST ( 30 )

TOKYO —

Japan gathered senior ministers Monday to discuss security concerns following North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il’s death as the government offered rare “condolences” on the passing of a much-reviled man.

Minutes after the noon broadcast by Pyongyang’s official media, Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda cancelled a speech and rushed back to his office where he chaired an emergency security meeting.

Noda said he had ordered officials to beef up intelligence-gathering on North Korea, to work closely with the United States, China and South Korea, and to prepare for further unexpected developments.

“We will gather information to assess how this incident will affect the situation,” he later told reporters.

“I have instructed (agencies) to prepare even for the unexpected to ensure this will not adversely influence peace and stability on the Korean peninsula.”

Defense Minister Yasuo Ichikawa said no unusual military moves by the unpredictable regime had been detected.

 
 
 
Kind of hard to want to go on sending food to those people when food we send them gets sold for money to buy weapons and when government policies are the main cause of hunger there and people on the outs with the government are always first to starve.

Only thing I can figure to do would be to air drop food to the people who really were low on the totem pole in that system if you could figure out who and where they were. Also might make sense to air drop huge numbers of cheap radios and have some sort of massive radio-free Korea program in place, but I can't picture our state dept or anybody doing anything like that any time soon.
 
 
@gungasnake,

well..that is already done.

But here is the hard part... even in those secluded hard to reach parts of the country where starvation is a common thing, there are officials that are in arms reach to gun down even the helicopters. Unfortunately the people suffer no matter what.

there is only so much you can do when it comes to trying to sneak in food when every avenue in either gets the deliverer killed...the food taken.. or the locals killed when the officials find they have some..

Same thing in many parts of africa.
Soldiers die very day delivering FOOD and being shot down by the 'officials' there..

its horrible
 
 
@gungasnake,

and what these people do not realize.... is that when the army ( or who ever is delivering ) is thwarted ENOUGH times by the officials in one particular area... they move on to try to find another place to feed people. These officials ( so called) are shooting themselves in the foot by doing this. They are losing what little supplies they are able to STEAL because they are killing the deliverers. Dumbasses.
Pretty soon the project will have to be abandoned because there will BE NO safe spot to drop.. then what ! they dont think about things like that
 
 
 
According to the memoir of a man who says he spent 11 years as the family's sushi chef, Jong Un is tough and ambitious like his father.
The chef, who goes by the pen name Kenji Fujimoto, described Jong Un as a competitive, even ruthless, child.
Dressed in a military outfit, the young Jong Un "glared at me with a menacing look when we shook hands" the first time they met, Fujimoto wrote in "Kim Jong Il's Chef." ''I can never forget the look in his eyes which seemed to be saying, 'This one is a despicable Japanese.'"

China Moves to Ensure Stability in North Korea
By EDWARD WONG - New York Times

BEIJING — Following the death of Kim Jong-il, the North Korean leader, China is moving quickly to deepen its influence over senior officials in North Korea and particularly with those in the military to try to ensure stability in the isolated nation, according to Chinese and foreign former government officials and analysts.

China is North Korea’s foremost ally, and leaders here had been hoping Mr. Kim would live for at least another two or three years to solidify the succession process that he had begun with his youngest son, Kim Jong-un, the former officials and analysts say. Uncertainty now looms over whether the younger Kim can consolidate his power in the face of competing elite factions and whether he and other leaders will continue initiatives begun by his father, including studying China as a model for possible economic reforms, the observers say. The elder Kim had made four trips to China in the last 18 months to look at a range of economic projects, and Chinese leaders had urged him to experiment with reforms.

The greatest concern for China is whether Mr. Kim’s death will lead to a rise in tensions on the divided Korean peninsula. That could happen if generals in Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea, try to reinforce their hold on power through aggression toward South Korea. Unlike China, where the Communist Party stands as the ultimate authority, the military is the final arbiter in North Korea.

Mr. Kim’s death “means that China will have to assume a heavier responsibility over the relationship in order to maintain peace and stability on the Korean peninsula,” said Xu Wenji, a professor of Northeast Asian studies at Jilin University and a former Chinese envoy to South Korea.

Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing, said, “The death significantly enhances uncertainty on the peninsula.” He added: “In my personal view, the succession is very hastily arranged and Kim Jong-un is very ill prepared to take over.”

“Frankly speaking, there is a substantial chance of political instability in North Korea,” he said. “This is based on the nature of the regime, the inadequate process of succession and economic hardships in the country.”

As anxieties bubbled to the surface in Beijing, so did signs of mourning. People brought bouquets of white flowers to the North Korean Embassy in Beijing and were allowed inside. Police officers surrounding the building kept all others at a distance. Asked about visas, a guard said, “Come back next year.” The flag atop the embassy roof was lowered to half-staff. One resident of Beijing with ties to North Korea said telephone operators in Pyongyang were crying when he got through to a call center there.

Evening newspapers in China ran front-page headlines above photographs of Mr. Kim. Xinhua, the state news agency, cited a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Ma Zhaoxu, giving the official position on Mr. Kim’s death. Mr. Kim was a “great leader,” Mr. Ma said, and “China and North Korea will strive together to continue making positive contributions.”

There were some irreverent takes. Netease, a popular Internet portal, ran a topics page with a headline saying: “Kim Jong-il’s Death Shows the Importance of Losing Weight.” The subtitle was even more subversive: “A government is just like a human body, in that neither can afford to be too fat.” As of Monday evening, the page was still online.

The strong ties between China and the two Kims were on display during a lavish military parade in Pyongyang in October 2010 that was used to signal to the world that the younger Kim would inherit power. There, Zhou Yongkang, a member of the Politburo Standing Committee who oversees the public security apparatus, sat in the front row with the two Kims. Afterward, the elder Kim began gradually introducing his successor to various Chinese officials.

“At this moment, China might provide the best chance of stability,” said Bob Carlin, a former State Department official and a fellow at Stanford University who travels to North Korea.

“They want to be the best informed and have a modicum of influence and have people consulting with them at this moment,” he added. “The rest of us are deaf, dumb, blind and with our arms tied behind our backs.”

John Delury, a scholar of China and the two Koreas at Yonsei University in Seoul, said: “Chinese diplomats are the only ones who can pick up the phone and talk to North Korean counterparts about what is going on, what to expect. This reveals the fatal weakness in Washington and Seoul’s over-reliance on sanctions over the past three years.”

China wants North Korea to stand strong as a buffer state that keeps American troops in South Korea at a distance, but relations between the two Communist countries have had to endure complicated twists in recent years. Chinese officials were upset by North Korea’s sudden shelling of Yeonpyeong Island in South Korea in late 2010, and have lobbied North Korean leaders to refrain from further military actions, analysts say. Earlier in 2010, China was forced into an awkward position when South Korea and the United States accused North Korea of sinking the Cheonan, a South Korean warship, with a torpedo. The United States put pressure on China to agree with its allegation, which China refused to do.

Those events might have increased anxieties in China about North Korea, but they have also made North Korea more dependent on China for economic support. Two scholars of North Korea at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Stephan Haggard and Marcus Noland, estimated in a paper published this year that China and South Korea alone recently accounted for 55 percent to 80 percent of North Korea’s trade. After the Cheonan sinking, most trade with South Korea stopped, so China became an even bigger partner.

Exact trade figures are difficult to pinpoint. A paper published in December 2010 by the Congressional Research Service estimated that in 2009, exports from North Korea to China increased to $793 million, while Chinese exports to North slowed slightly to $1.9 billion. Chinese trade and investment undercut the economic sanctions that the United States and other nations imposed on North Korea to try to halt its nuclear program.

The trade can take many forms. Susan Shirk, a former State Department official and professor of political science at the University of California at San Diego, said she spoke with a North Korean man in Pyongyang in September who was conducting state-to-state trade with China. She said the North Korean worked for the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and he was selling iron ore to China at the price that China pays to large trade partners like Australia; in return, he was buying corn from China at the price on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange that day.

North Korean leaders are also trying to jump-start the languishing trade zone of Rason on the Chinese border and to get Chinese businesspeople to invest in tourism infrastructure that includes a creaking cruise ship running between Rason and the Mount Kumgang nature park.

After Mr. Kim’s death, the North Koreans “are still going have to rely on China to large degree,” said Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt, an analyst based in Beijing for the International Crisis Group. “China and North Korea are locked in this dance of interdependency. China is going to have to continue to be a big benefactor and bankroll North Korea to a big extent.”

Air-dropping anything on a country with lots of ground-to-air missiles, a dozen nukes, and a paranoid commander in chief? Sorry Gunga - I suspect you really work for The Onion, and that you also wrote this:  http://www.theonion.com/articles/kim-jongil-interprets-sunrise-as-act-of-war,2077/ 
Anybody here knows how to read Korean? What do the posters say? I think that's a real picture, but it's hard to tell - do they sell The Onion in Korea?!
 

 
...According to North Korean military sources, the sunrise, sighted at 6:17 a.m. by patrolling officers, was not fully confirmed until an hour later, at which time Kim assessed the threat himself, and immediately released a harshly worded warning to the U.S. and the United Nations Security Council.
 
 
 
Communist slavery does not appear to be much in peril.
 
 
I will not speak about the Dear Leader, but about my friend Virulo and his relationship with North Korea.

My friend Virulo is a Cuban humorist-songwriter-performer, famous in his home country and well known is most of Latin America. He's critical of the Communist regime but somehow managed, for many years, to be an "accepted dissenter". He lives in Mexico now. "You are Fidel's Evtushenko", I used to tease him.

Well, once there was this worldwide meeting of Communist "cultural workers", and Virulo was part of the Cuban delegation. A North Korean delegate approached him and asked him what was his line of work.
"Humor", replied Virulo.
"Oh, we in Korea are past that stage".

This prompted my friend to study more about North Korean theatre and music, and he finally came out with a hilarious puppet show: "Great Harvest in the People's Cooperative Number 27", which has hailed in Pyongyang... as the North Koreans didn't understand the very sharp humor.

"Great Harvest in the People's Cooperative Number 27" played in Havana, too, but was banned shortly after. Unlike the North Koreans, Cuban officials noticed all the acid sarcasm.
This, of course, means that, unlike North Korea's, Cuban Communism hasn't developed past the stage of humor.

I'm not too surprised by this, I've readhHe's been so ill for so long, the North Koreans have felt it necessary to release periodic photos of him to prove to the world he's still alive and "in charge". I'm almost a little surprised that they released the news of his death so promptly, rather than trying to sit on it for whatever reason.
 
 
I remember in 1982, I was in my bathroom, washing my hands,
looking in the mirror, when an idea came into my mind.
The idea was a picture. It was of Leonid Brezhnev,
the commie dictator. He was delivering a speech
as thay used to do in Red Square.

Then, a big black bird landed on Brezhnev's head.
He proceeded to evacuate his bowels over Brezhnev
and on the papers from which he was reading his speech,
thereby preventing Brezhnev from any further continuation.

The next day, the Kremlin announced that Brezhnev was dead.

I 've had no thawts qua Kim's demise, but I 'll take the commies' word for it anyway.
 
 
@msolga,

According to the initial report of "the dear leader's" death posted here:

 
.... the 69-year-old "passed away from a great mental and physical strain" while on a train trip, on his way to give "field guidance".

 

I've wondered about the nature of that "field guidance" since....
Ah, he gave his all to the people & the strain of it did him in!

You know, I've never trusted fat leaders who've demanded greater & greater sacrifices of their people for the greater good. (alway had problems with Mao for that reason.   )
I read a report last night about the "great leader's" culinary habits... like his great fondness for lobster, which he'd have flown direct to wherever he might be...

Such excesses (only one of quite a number, apparently) when so many north Koreans have endured such hardship, death & starvation under his rule strikes me as being absolutely obscene.
Yet, according to all reports, people were weeping in the streets at the great leader's passing.....
Just shows you, doesn't it, the incredible power of propaganda in a totalitarian state can lead people to believe anything...
Though, according to media reports, "the outpouring of grief" was not nearly as great as that following the death of his father, the “Great Leader” Kim Il-sung.

-
 
 
@msolga,

Don't forget, msolga, that some of this supposed "grief" in the streets could well be staged and orchestrated for publicity purposes. Obviously foreign news media were going to be reporting on the people's reaction and a good face had to be put forward.
 
 
@Lustig Andrei,

If someone feels a need to weep
what purpose is served by going into the street? to go WHERE ?
 
 
@Lustig Andrei,

Which is why there's really no point in hoping that il's death would change anything.
 
 
@Lustig Andrei,

But it's so hard to feign grief & produce tears on demand!  

But I do understand what you're saying, Andrew.

I'd still like to know more about his final "field guidance" mission, though...

Honestly, David, one of the funniest place to visit -if you know the culture- is Cuba, and the funniest people to talk with are the Cubans.
They're always laughing at themselves, at their government and at their own cowardice for not toppling it.
For them, life is often taken as a big joke.
It has to. The joke is on them.

The big drama is that North Koreans don't even have the chance to scape with a drop of humor.
 
 
Kim Jong Il?

No, he dead.
 
 
@OmSigDAVID,

 
U r telling me that I don't have a clue about communism ?

 

I think it's rather benevolent of Felix to limit it to Communism.
 
 
@izzythepush,

I have studied communism for quite a few decades
including discussions with surviving fugitives of communist slavery,
some of whose relatives did not make it. Its pretty serious; death is better.
 
 
@OmSigDAVID,

Pinochet's regime is a good thing though? You posted earlier that your Commie associates were sad in 1991 when the Soviet Union collapsed. Those people weren't real communists. A real communist would have been sad when Stalin seized power, and when Trotsky was murdered. The collapse of the Soviet Union was the collapse of red fascism.
 
 
I found this really interesting site quite by accident this afternoon.

It consists of photographs of Kim Jong-il looking at all sorts of different things!

Enjoy.

the dear leader liked to look at things.

@msolga,

Thanks.

That was both amusing and a vivid testamony of the absurdity and hypocrisy of authoritarian rule.
 
 
The Evil Empire came into being by murder of the Czar & his family.

The commie slave masters r indistinguishable from traditional old world monarchs,

@OmSigDAVID,

The Tsar's regime was pretty shitty. The great tragedy of the Russian Revolution was the premature death of Lenin. Have you read Animal Farm?
 
 
@izzythepush,

The Tsar's regime was a good deal more tolerant and beneficial for Russians than what followed its collapse. The achievements of Russia during the last half of the 19th century in art, science, literature and even economic growth far eclipsed what followedf under Lenin and all his successors.
 
 
@georgeob1,

According to Angus Maddison's long term economic data charts, the per capita income in 1870 Russia was 1,023 dollars (1990 purchase power parity); 43 years later, in 1913, a few years before the Bolsheviks, it was 1,488 dollars: a growth of 45 %, roughly 1% a year. By 1950, it was 2,834 dollars. Under the first Bolsheviks, personal income rose about 90% in 37 years, double the rate than under the tzars. With Stalin gone, average income grew at a much faster rate: by 1973 it was at 6.058: it more than doubled in only 23 years. From then on, stagnation, as the system collapsed under its own bureaucracy.

 http://www.ggdc.net/MADDISON/oriindex.htm 

I agree with you, George, about the achievements in art & literature. The Soviets did build a science powerhouse in some disciplines, so they were competitive with the tzars to say the least. And the economic data says they fared better until the mid-seventies.
There were no freedoms under the Bolsheviks. But was the Tzar's Ojrana less feared than the Soviet's KGB?
 
 
@fbaezer,

Soooo very convenient, cite an alleged expert while linking not to his quoted claims, but instead to his self-serving biography! Likely that method passes for academic integrity in Mexico - though FYI the assorted claims of your "expert" have been widely derided and ridiculed everywhere including in this award-winning book published by Princeton University Press:

 
A Farewell to Alms:
A Brief Economic History of the World
Gregory Clark

Winner of the 2008 Gold Independent Publisher Book Medal, Finance/Investment/Economics Category
 

 http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8461.html 

You should be ashamed of yourself for assuming all the posters here are terminal idiots who never had a clue about finance and economics, enabling you to freely dispense your Marxist drivel! Your "expert" professor doesn't even deny making up his alleged data, and instead blames Prof. Clark.

Don't try this again.
 
 
@izzythepush,

I did.
I understand that Winston Churchill urinated upon the western wall
of the 3rd Reich, to demonstrate his contempt for its creator.
I almost never use reference to excrement in my writing,
but for ulyanoff (a/k/a: "lenin") I will make an exception,
applying the term "shitty" to him. His work was horrible beyond ineffability.

David
 
 
And all this prattle has what to do with the current situation in N. Korea?
 
 
@izzythepush,

 
Pinochet's regime is a good thing though?
 
Yes; it made me very, very happy, in terms of vengeance and justice.
I was also elated in October of 1965, when the Indonesians
counterattacked the commies and killed huge numbers of them.
Its sad that the commies that perpetrated the worst atrocities
got away with it, safely in death, but Pinochet did the best he coud, bless him!

 
You posted earlier that your Commie associates were sad in 1991 when the Soviet Union collapsed.
Those people weren't real communists.
 
Yes; social friends.
Thay favored the continuation of communist slavery in the commie empire.

 
A real communist would have been sad when Stalin seized power,
and when Trotsky was murdered.
 
Maybe u think that Stalin was not a commie, as Hitler was not a nazi
and that there were no commies in the NKVD,
as there were no nazis in the Gestapo.

 
The collapse of the Soviet Union was the collapse of red fascism.
 
I will not dispute THAT; in my mind,
it is not necessary to distinguish among all of the collectivist-authoritarians.
Whether a victim is torn to pieces and eaten by a tiger or a lion
makes little difference to the victim.

Now, I venture forth to prepare for tonight's Mensa Dinner
of the Opulent Mensan SIG at 1 If By Land, 2 If By Sea,

I wish some people would actually read Marx so they would understand the difference between these three things:

Totalitarianism (or totalitarian rule) is a political system where the state recognizes no limits to its authority and strives to regulate every aspect of public and private life wherever feasible.

Fascism
A political philosophy, movement, or regime that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition

Communism
Economic and social system in which all (or nearly all) property and resources are collectively owned by a classless society and not by individual citizens. It envisaged common ownership of all land and capital and withering away of the coercive power of the state.

We have never had a Communist country. I don't think we ever will knowing human nature. We've had people who dangled the fantasy of it in front of desperate people so they could take power, but Marx would have hated them as much as he hated Capitalism. China now has more in common with USA capitalism than it does with any form of Communism.
 
 
@Lustig Andrei,

Yup. "Round about way" is correct. I agree it's fun to rehash 20th Cenury history,something we all do all the time. But I doubt that there's much chance of any significant changes in the repressive totalitarian regime of No. Korea. If young Kim should be one-upped by some other pretender to the throne, the army will still take charge and nothing whatever is likely to change. The only hope we have is that China might finally get sick and tired of holding up this country (N.K., I mean) and its pretense of being a Communist regime and turn a blind eye to a land invasion of the place from the South.

In the final analysis what is and isn't real 'Communism' has no bearing on the present situation. Why do you thing both Soel and Tokyo went into emergency sessions as soon as King Jong Il's death was announced? They're not just worried about the question of succession. They're speculating on whether anything can be done to take advantage of this state of confusion.

The problem here is that Marx didn't coin the terms to which you refer, and that the terms totalitarianism andf Fascism came into use only after Marx died.

Most historians and political thinkers agree with you that we have never seen and likely will never see a "real" communist country or system precisely because it is an illusion contrary to human nature. Given that, why would any serious person wish to consult Marx' s writings for any purpose other than that of examining historical delusions?
 
 
@georgeob1,

Ideas about Utopia are worth studying. Marx also had some accurate observations about capitalism, whether you like them or not. I just find it annoying that people use these three words interchangeably when they refer to three different states of government. You could blend Totalitarianism and Fascism, but Communism is the opposite in that it wants to eliminate all forms of rule in favor of the people as an equal whole.
 
 
@Green Witch,

I agree with what you're saying in principle, Green Witch. But remember that it's just a semantics problem when looked at that way. You're quite right about the intrinsic meaning of the word 'Communism', but we can't forget that the Soviet totalitarians (or totalitarian Soviets, if you will) did call themselves Communists and the entire movement was universally referred to as Communism in all the news and other social media. Hence, to say that 20th Century Communism was a repressive totalitarian movement is not really incorrect.
 
 
@Lustig Andrei,

 
.....The only hope we have is that China might finally get sick and tired of holding up this country (N.K., I mean).......and turn a blind eye to a land invasion of the place from the South.

 

The only ocean access to the Vladivostok military area the Chinese now have is courtesy of North Korea. If the South were so stupid as to cross the DMZ (more landmines per m2 than anywhere else on the planet) braving the North's artillery and nukes, they would cut off China completely. Please consult a map.

Communism is an abstract idea that has never, as you acknowledged, been manifested in any real form on a political scale. It doesn't "do" or "want" anything.

The flaw in Marx' thinking was that the concentration of power required to seize all public and private property - all for the "common good" - and to control all economic activity in a way that directly contradicts observable patterns of human behavior, is itself sufficient for an intolerable tyranny. The "whithering away" of that power is, and always has been an absurd fantasy - as the unfortunate citizens of Russia and Ukraine discovered.
 
 
@High Seas,

There was an expert on the BBC the other night. He said in theory people may want a unified Korea, but no-one wants to pay for it. So the realpolitik is that China, Japan and S. Korea are more concerned with containing N. Korea than putting their hands in their pockets.

O, yeah; tell that to the fugitives thereof,
some of whom fled under the gunfire of communist automatic weapons,
while thay fled after jumping the Berlin Wall, or crashing thru it with trucks.
Tell that to the fugitives from Cuba whose little homemade boats
were sought to be sunk from commie helicopters
boming them from on hi, as thay fled communism toward Florida.

Tell them it did not happen and of your definitions.

@OmSigDAVID,

David, we are all perfectly well aware of your "commie" obsession.
There is no need to go on & on & on & on about it.....
It becomes incredibly tiresome after about the first 10 repetitive posts....
Please spare us.

It is the lives of people that matter, the conditions they live under, not what tyrant dictators call themselves or their states, no matter which political ideologies they claim to be serving.
To claim (as you have) that Pinochet is a hero & "right" when his military dictatorship murdered & "disappeared " those who who opposed his regime, while carrying on about reprehensible "commies" like Kim Jong-il strikes me as blind hypocrisy. Both were dictators, both were responsible for despicable human rights violations.

It matters nothing whether tyrannical dictators claim to be "left" or "right".
Nothing justifies such extreme actions. Nothing can justify the (at least) half a million who were killed in Suharto's purges in Indonesia. Nothing can justify Stalin's reign of terror. Why can't you see that?

@msolga,

Many ideas are perceived as tiresome by folks who are not particularly interested in them. Some people perceive an acute interest in the safety of whales as tiresome; others find it very interesting and important. In this area I believe tolerance of the interests of others should be the dominant value.

With respect to political systems there are important, real distinctions to be made. Few systems or governments are entirely guiltless of individual acts of injustice or even of some systematic acts of this type. The actions of Austrailians, Canadians, Brazilians and Americans (and others) with respect to native populations are examples as is the former practice of slavery in the United States and the British Empire. I suppose that you would (properly) find all of these acts "unjustifiable". Despite all this meaningful distinctions can be made with respect to the general willingness of various countries and political systems to engage in such actions.

Certainly in the modern era self described Communist systems clearly distinguished themselves as uniquely willing and adept practicioners of mass murder and oppression. Indeed they even coined an abstract term of art for the political aspect of the practice: it was "the elimination of the irreconcilables" in the Marxist/Leninist lexicon. In the USSR that process is thought to have consumed some 10 million lives and in Maoist China some 20 plus million. Even the more popular Fidel Castro had many tens of thousands of his bourgeois countrymen killed following his successful revolution. (In comparison his Argentine and Chilean counterparts were small time pipsqueaks.)

The similarly authoritarian Facsist governments of Germany and Italy also engaged in such acts. However, I believe it is also evident that the German version of this system was much more ghastly and murderous than was the Italian one. Neither were "excusable" but one was much worse than the other. I think that both of these and the aforementioned Communist systems were far worse and more systematically committed to such horrors than were the episodic excesses of Australia, Canada, the U.S. or the British Empire - or even the excesses observed in Argentina and Chile during periods of intense local political struggle. Indeed in both of these latter cases the militarist right wing governments voluntarily walked off the political stage after their respective political struggles ended - that is something none of the Communist or Facsist governments ever did.

In short there are indeed meaningful and significant distinctions to be made in this area - even involving individual actions that you might justifiably find to be "inexcusable".
 
 
@msolga,

Right on, msolga. I've said this before on other threads and I'll say it again -- regardless of what label youput on it, OmSigDAVID would have made an admirable and efficient COMMUNIST.
 
 
@georgeob1,

 
Indeed in both of these latter cases the militarist right wing governments voluntarily walked off the political stage after their respective political struggles ended - that is something none of the Communist or Facsist governments ever did.
 

At the risk of ambiguity through the use of metaphors, the communist regimes of Eastern Europe, if not walking off of the political stage, instead declared bankruptcy, went out of business, shuttered their shops, and cleared the way for more democratic shop keeping.
 
 
@msolga,

Yes it would, but why should we be prepared to limit our hopes and expectations to a slightly benign dictatorship.
 
 
@msolga,

Why should anyone fear what Baby Kim might do?

Perhaps because it is widely believed that to make his bones with the NK military he arranged for the recent track on SK that resulted in 50 death (you should read what you quote in your posts)

Or maybe because be was raised by a father who sent NK commandos to kill the SK president when he was abroad. They missed the president but got two of his ministers.

The same Dad who had his favorite SK actress kidnapped so she could make a movie in NK.

Insane evil runs in the family, and they have a huge military and nukes.

A security calculus that assumes NK leaders will behave in a way that can be rationally predicted is fundamentally flawed.
 
 
@Green Witch,

There has never been a country that has adopted communism as you define it, but we have had quite a number of Communist countries, and all of them have been disastrous for their citizens.

They've identified themselves as communist and they have ruled over, literally, billions of people, while hold the power to destroy the planet. You're going to tell them they're not communists?

You're going to tell the people who consider them as actual representations of communist nations that they are ignorant and wrong?

NO. So long as my support of Gen. Pinochet is sincere & earnest, it is not "hypocrisy".
I assure u, in the fullness of unlimited candor that I supported Pinochet's attacks against the commies.

 
Both were dictators, both were responsible for despicable human rights violations.
 
No; doing it to the commies

I prefer not to insult u by suggesting that u cannot
understand the concept of a WAR. It was the 3rd World War,

@georgeob1,

George, my comment was more about another poster's apparent inability to have any empathy at all for the victims of dictators whose particular ideologies he supports..... apparently it's OK to cause mass civilian suffering, deaths & human rights abuses if a particular dictator or regime is of the "right" variety.
I find such an attitude incomprehensible.

However, if we are going to compare which "side" has caused the most suffering to humankind during fairly recent history, I would argue that the powerful "puppet masters" have much to answer for, too..... I mean those powerful countries whose influence (say nothing of the arms they supply) have allowed the likes of Kim Jong-il to hold power through their continued support & influence. How long could a relatively small fry regime like North Korea's last without Chinese government support?

Would "the rivers of blood" have occurred in Indonesia without outside intervention & support of Suharto? How long would Burma's repressive military junta, which has caused untold misery to that county's citizens, have lasted in isolation, without powerful Chinese government support?

And while we're talking of civilian casualties... we should also take into account direct military interventions into countries like Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan & the horrendous toll on civilians in those countries, by far more powerful countries with their own agendas.....

I think it's reasonable that their contributions are factored into the equation, too, when talking about human casualties. It is not just extreme left or right dictatorships alone which hold responsibility.

There is no middle ground: it's "us" against "them". If you're not all in for the USA and its allies, then you're a "commie". And you lost!

I believe patriotic Nationalism is his main drive. Not ideology, not deeds. His goal: to make sure the USA is the most powerful country in the world (doesn't matter if it is feared or respected), and that the US will be done elsewhere in this planet.

If patriotic Nationalism is his main drive, had David been born elsewhere, he would have probably made a good Communist, a good follower of the Great Leader, or a good Nazi.

(And I often get the feeling that he has no real undertsanding of the underlying principles that govern the U.S. Constitution either.) It's all about America, right or wrong.

Frankly, that kind of ignorance and attitude disgusts me.

I believe patriotic Nationalism is his main drive. Not ideology, not deeds.
 
Your belief has no basis in fact.
It shows that u don't know me at all. My years of posts have shown
very strong ideological leanings tending almost to anarchy,
strong anti -collectivist ( anti -commie, anti -liberal, anti -nazi)
in their energetic LOVE of personal freedom, Individualism,
support of laissez faire free enterprize and of hedonism,
hence my creation of the Opulent Mensan Special Interest Group.

 
His goal: to make sure the USA is the most powerful country in the world (doesn't matter if it is feared or respected),
and that the US will be done elsewhere in this planet.
 
My goal is also a very drastic, radical curtailment
of domestic jurisdiction within America, bearing in mind
that PERSONAL FREEDOM and jurisdiction are INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL!

 
If patriotic Nationalism is his main drive, had David been born elsewhere,
he would have probably made a good Communist,
 
1. It is not my main drive.
2. I fiercely oppose authoritarianism
and I oppose collective ownership of property (exceptions being in military environments).

 
a good follower of the Great Leader,
 
Maybe follow him long enuf to take him out from the back.

I do not think N Korea will ever adventure and risk survival by attacking.
It knows that if S Korea was in danger of being destroyed.. US would carpark Pyongyang [a large flat sheet of bitumen]

As an aussie. im well away from the lunacy of post stalinist stalinism.
Yet the bleed trough affects all
BTW. I had a fling with a girl from Pusan. [this is between marriages]
She said i should shut up lol. a wise woman.
 
 
@Hjarloprillar,

Oh, I didn't think you were being an ass. Just expressing what the world looks like from where you are. That's all anyone can do, I think.

And, yes, I do think that Pyongyang has enough sense to know that full-on aggression = suicide for the regime. People here are worried about the possibility that someone on the way out with nothing to lose may briefly wind up with a finger on the button, so to speak. Honestly, I think it will be business as usual for a while yet. I'm on the fringes of the survival radius of a nuclear blast on/over the Blue House (Korean version of the White House), so I'm hoping the wheel doesn't fall off the NK wagon just yet...
 
 
@FBM,

You keep safe mate, I can't think of a more unsettling place to be. Lets hope if nothing else, there's stability.
 
 
@izzythepush,

Thanks, izzy. It is interesting, in its own way. One reason I stay here is that I'd love to be able to travel freely in the North some day after reunification. It'd be like stepping back in time about 50 years.
 
 
@FBM,

We all fervently hope no wheels fall off.....unless that leads to a new and much better regime.

Love to hear more from you about S Korea and how YOYNsee the world.a
 
 
@FBM,

I wish u a lot of good luck.

Have u considered the possibility
that it might be SAFER
to await re-unification elsewhere, beyond the reach of the communists??

@dlowan,

Well, I've been over here since 1996. I guess I'm absorbing the general SK attitude towards the conflict with the North. That is, it's just a part of everyday life, not something that you let dominate your thoughts. There's nothing the average person can do about it, anyway.
 
 
@OmSigDAVID,

Yeah, I've considered that, but I want to be among the first to cross over the DMZ when/if that day finally comes. Y'know, before it gets overcrowded, paved over and wired up like the South. I've been into photography for a few years, and I want some shots of the way people live in the outlying provinces. That way of life will disappear quickly after reunification. Of course, that way of life includes a lot of hunger and deprivation, so that will be a good thing overall, but a lot of culture will disappear with it. It would be nice to be able to document some of it first.
 
 
@msolga,

 
George, my comment was more about another poster's apparent inability to have any empathy at all for the victims of dictators whose particular ideologies he supports..... apparently it's OK to cause mass civilian suffering, deaths & human rights abuses if a particular dictator or regime is of the "right" variety.
I find such an attitude incomprehensible.

However, if we are going to compare which "side" has caused the most suffering to humankind during fairly recent history, I would argue that the powerful "puppet masters" have much to answer for, too..... I mean those powerful countries whose influence (say nothing of the arms they supply) have allowed the likes of Kim Jong-il to hold power through their continued support & influence. How long could a relatively small fry regime like North Korea's last without Chinese government support?

Would "the rivers of blood" have occurred in Indonesia without outside intervention & support of Suharto? How long would Burma's repressive military junta, which has caused untold misery to that county's citizens, have lasted in isolation, without powerful Chinese government support?

And while we're talking of civilian casualties... we should also take into account direct military interventions into countries like Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan & the horrendous toll on civilians in those countries, by far more powerful countries with their own agendas.....

I think it's reasonable that their contributions are factored into the equation, too, when talking about human casualties. It is not just extreme left or right dictatorships alone which hold responsibility.
 

I think you contradict yourself here. Which nations were the "puppet masters" who should have intervened to stop the "rivers of blood" in Indonesia following the fall of Sukarno???? I take it you mean the United States. If so how do you rationalize your criticism of our removal of Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq? He started a bloody 11 year war with Iran that killed far more people than the massacres in Indonesia under Suharto and general Moerdani. Indeed Saddam executed or massacred upwards of three hundred thousand of his own people during the same period, and posed continuing threats to his neighbors and his own people.

North Korea is credited with killing millions of its own people through mass starvation or harsh imprisionment. The regime was brought into power by the former Soviet Union. It's attempt to expand into control and oppression of South Korea was stopped at great human cost by the United States and many allies: was this war and the attendant human suffering justifiable? Following the fall of the Soviet Union China provided trade and some economic assistance, but was at best a passive supporter of the regime - apparently believing it was more of a threat to us than to them. Should North Korea's other neighbors, Japan and South Korea have intervened to remove the regime in your view? By not doing so did they become "puppet masters" too?? Is the United States at fault for not intervening against a regime in North Korea that has killed far more of its people than did Suharto in Indonesia?

How do you make these judgments?

Apparently you find all human suffering "unjustifiable" irrespective of the apparent motives of those involved. That surely is your right, however, don't ask serious people to believe it makes sense either morally or realistically.
 
 
@georgeob1,

No, I don't think I've contradicted myself in the case of Suharto's military purges & take-over in Indonesia, George. I was referring to powerful outside interference & support before & during the shocking events that occurred, rather than intervention once the mass slaughters had begun... in any case, why would puppet masters, without whose covert support Suharto might not have acted to take power, intervene?

 
Apparently you find all human suffering "unjustifiable" irrespective of the apparent motives of those involved. That surely is your right, however, don't ask serious people to believe it makes sense either morally or realistically.
 

Well the "motives" (either by "puppet masters'" behind-the-scenes support, or direct military intervention, or support of dictators ) are generally a grab for power, despite whatever justifications might be given. (like weapons of mass destruction, for example)

So yes, of course I find the deaths, suffering & hardship of ordinary people affected by such events unjustifiable. What did the ordinary people of Burma, North Korea, Afghanistan, Bali & Java in Indonesia, Chile, Ukraine, to name just a few, have to do with the grand plans of the great & powerful?

Perhaps more "serious people" could justify the unnecessary the deaths & suffering of so many (who were often poor & powerless in their own countries), on "moral or realistic" grounds?

'As' a geopolitician [and scientist] emotions must play no part.. only what is.
Let us be honest. A little brother to US. One that fought in Korea and Malaysia That lost many good men in Vietnam for no reason but to placate America. Australia is a brown nosed nation To the power of US and its nuclear powered carrier battle groups.That rule the seas and keep our island nation safe. A fall back position if all goes to hell in continental US.
Read up on history of S Korea and you see that a hasty treaty at end of ww2 defined boarders of that natiion. Yet it became a force in the world, industrially and millitary.
Indonesia was left flapping in wind. Thus its hectic rise to nationhood.
Its fault was that it was not next to a communist state. And had no interest to the 'superpowers.'
Yet it made its way... And is now a proud nation with a voice.
Unlike such disasters as somalia Or hell holes like burma.

Indonesia is vital to the geopolitical thinking of australia.
We are joined at the hip by demographics and geology.

@Hjarloprillar,

I have no argument at all re your assertion that Australian governments (not necessarily always the Australian people ) tend to be brown-nosed in these things. (England & the "empire" prior to the US).
I disagree with you about Indonesia having "no interest in superpowers". There is quite a bit of information available about covert influence on what occurred there in the mid-sixties, easily Googled.

It sounds like your argument is about means justifying ends & I disagree vehemently, particularly when the ends come at the expense of human rights & civilian deaths.
If you consider those sorts of concerns merely "emotional" ones, I also disagree. Obviously.
 
 
@OmSigDAVID,

From Wiki

Geopolitics, from Greek Γη (earth) and Πολιτική (politics) in broad terms, is a theory that describes the relation between politics and territory whether on local or international scale.

It comprises the art and practice of analyzing, proscribing, forecasting, and the using of political power over a given territory. Specifically, is a method of foreign policy analysis, which seeks to understand, explain and predict international political behaviour primarily in terms of geographical variables. Those geographical variables generally are: geographic location of the country or countries in question, size of the countries involved, climate of the region the countries are in, topography of the region, demography, natural resources available in the territory, technological development.[1] Traditionally, the term has applied primarily to the impact of geography on politics(and likewise), but its usage has evolved over the past century to encompass wider connotations.
 
 
@msolga,

No the australian people dont agree with me.. thats because they have little idea of world politics or the power of the military.
Australians think they are free and fine because.. well. its the sunny country.
What bad can happen here?
Most australians still think galipoli was our idea and we died valiantly.
When it was englands plan for us to die like dogs in the mud. to distract the turks. [and for no other reason than distraction]
As a military historian.. There is NO WAY we could have breached the dardanel pen.

True.. the US and others stuck their noses int indonesia over the years.
As you say the 60's
I dont need to google

I am some what mystified. I imagined my path was 'the ends do not justify the means.'
This is why i was being honest
If i tried to show how we are being lied to and used.
It may sink in

Not using emotion is science.
And only science.

Which part of what you're saying don't "the Australian people" agree with?  
(I'm Australian, btw)

Many would not be remotely surprised that we've been "lied to & used", by our own government/s & others. Just like people in many other countries. Wikileaks revelations have simply added to the existing list.

To tell the truth, I'm not quite clear about what your argument is, exactly.

Secrecy surrounds Kim's state funeral
Updated December 28, 2011 16:30:09

The funeral ceremonies for former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il are underway in Pyongyang.

Pictures broadcast on North Korean state television showed a limousine bearing a huge portrait of a smiling Kim Jong-il leading the funeral cortege, which began moving slowly from the Kumsusan Memorial Palace.

A hearse carrying the coffin was led by a weeping Kim Jong-un, accompanied Jang Song-thaek, his uncle and a key powerbroker in the transition, and Ri Yong-ho, the army chief of staff.

Successor Kim Jong-un was dressed in black and bare-headed and gloveless despite the cold.

Tens of thousands of troops standing in the snow bowed their heads as the hearse drove past.

Earlier, a massed military band was shown playing sombre music as mourners streamed past Kim's body.

The exact details of the funeral service itself were a closely guarded secret, but North Korea watchers expected it to be roughly the same as that for the country's first leader Kim Il-sung.

The motorcade is expected to pass through the streets of Pyongyang via a series of military honour guards before returning to Kumsusan Memorial Palace where Kim Jong-il's body will remain on display.

 

Korean Central TV still of Kim Jong-il's body lying in a glass coffin in Pyongyang on December 20, 2011. Photo: Burial today: Kim Jong-il's body lying in a glass coffin in Pyongyang (Reuters/North Korean TV)

Hundreds of thousands of mourners were expected to take part in the ceremonies and there were reports that North Koreans working overseas had been ordered to return home to take part in the national show of grief.

South Korean press reports suggested truckloads of flowers had been imported from China and said a group of Russian embalmers were en route to Pyongyang to embalm Kim's body.

Mourning will officially end tomorrow with a nationwide memorial service including a three-minute silence at noon. Trains, ships and other vehicles will sound their hooters.

Kim Jong-un will become the third member of the family to run the country.....<cont>

Incredible, isn't it?
No cost spared.

The money being splashed about would feed a lot of north Koreans for quite a while, probably.
 
 
@msolga,

Show respect.. go to knees.
or be executed
If Eisenhower had been a 'bad man'.. Americans would be cringing at his name. They would fall to knees and humble. As would the world. American global dictatorship hinged on the intentions of a very few in the 50's. And Such a thing was well with ability of US.
Luckily He was a good man. This is not the best of all possible worlds.
But it certainly is not the worst
