Ski officials finally gave the green light for the opening alpine races of the
Winter Olympics on Sunday as Germany's Felix Loch won an emotion-charged final
of the disaster-hit luge.

Adverse weather has hampered the staging of the men's opening downhill, and the
training for the women's super-combined, but after meetings the International
Ski Federation (ISF) said it was "very optimistic" both events could be held on
Monday.

"If the weather forecast for Monday is correct we will have minus five (Celsius)
in the finish area and minus seven to eight at the start," said men's race
director Guenter Hujara.

"If this is true then we will have perfect race conditions."

It was shot in the arm for organisers who have been struggling to get the Games
on track after the horrific death of Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili and
persistent weather woes.

But their joy was tempered when forced to close standing-room viewing areas for
snowboardcross races on Monday and Tuesday at Cypress Mountain due to safety
concerns after persistent heavy rain.

The downpours have washed away snow from where the viewing area was planned,
making it unsafe, meaning 4,000 tickets worth 400,000 dollars (380,000 US) must
be refunded.

In the luge, Loch led a German 1-2 with compatriot David Moeller finishing
second and Italy's Armin Zoeggler third.

Loch, the youngest winner of the title aged 20, said he was overjoyed to win
such an emotional event.

"It was the right decision. I was worried that I wouldn't do so well, but it's
ok, it's great," he said, referring to the track changes.

Not everyone was so keen on the new luge set-up, with some women complaining
that their shortened course was fit only for children.

"It's not a ladies' start, it's a kinder (child's) start," said Germany's
Natalie Geisenberger.

The host nation, meanwhile, finally broke a long jinx by winning its first gold
medal on home soil when Alexandre Bilodeau took the men's moguls freestyle
skiing title.

Until now, Canada held the dubious honour of being the only country to host the
Olympics twice -- Calgary 1988 Winter Games and Montreal 1976 Summer Games --
and not capture a gold medal.

Defending moguls champion Dale Begg-Smith of Australia was second and American
Bryon Wilson third.

The first gold of the day went to Frenchman Vincent Jay who did enough to edge
out Norway's Emil Hegle Svendsen and Croatia's Jakov Fak to take the men's 10km
biathlon sprint title.

Jason Lamy-Chappuis made it a double French celebration when he claimed gold in
the Nordic Combined, holding off American Johnny Spillane and Italian Alessandro
Pittin in a thrilling dash to the line.

It left the country on top of the medal table, ahead of Germany, the United
States and Canada.

Meanwhile, Martina Sablikova of the Czech Republic won the 3,000-metre women's
speedskating title ahead of Germany's Stephanie Beckert and Canada's Kristina
Groves.

While those events went ahead, the women's alpine skiing opener, the super-
combined, did not.

It was originally set for Sunday at Whistler but too much snow coupled with rain
had already forced it to be been rescheduled for Thursday and the problems got
worse when training again proved impossible.

But with news from the ISF that events will go ahead Monday, top women's skier
Lindsey Vonn, aiming for gold in the super-combined, downhill and super-G
events, is raring to go.

Her pre-Olympic plan turned sour after arriving in Canada when she revealed a
painful shin injury. However, the poor weather has given her crucial extra days
to recover.

"She's still sore but she's been really happy with the extra four days of rest,"
said USA team spokesman Doug Haney
