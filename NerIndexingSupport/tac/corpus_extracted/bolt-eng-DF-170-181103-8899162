Now that the Donald is no longer running, which candidate on the Republican side has better hair, Rick Perry or Mitt Romney?
 
 
Michelle Bachmann.

Mitt. I suspect it may be plastic though.

The country's going to hell and you're worried about hair.

This is proof liberals are stupid!!
 
 
Hair? lol really?

Stupidity has reached a new height for the left
 
 
Mitt, easily.

It has streaks of silver.
 
 
it's important that our Commander in Chief has nice hair and looks "Presidential". Where he stands on the issues is meaningless.

Trump’s unique, angular form of comb over seems to defy the laws of both physics and dignity. The more common variation is sported by men who refuse to grow bald gracefully. Any remaining hair at the side of the head (sometimes also ear hair) is grown long and combed over the top of the head (see also 2egg in a nest"). Comb overs are ill advised in strong winds and any situation in which you’d like to be taken seriously.

Seriously, I’ve often wondered if there’s a fetish market for this kind of embarrassing last resort. Still, I suppose it remains a potent threat in a middle-aged man's armoury against denting his childrens' street cred/reputation if the need arose.

huh, since the Donald was dismissed out of hand and you have obsessed about his comb over anyway, I'd say you would know more about this fetish than anyone.

Me.
 
 
 
 
 
Hello
 
 
I like Obama's hair the best... I also appreciate what it represents...   I can remember the ridiculous bitchin' the people and the press did about Bill Clinton's pricey haircuts way back when...  
 
 
 
it's important that our Commander in Chief has nice hair and looks "Presidential". <snip>

 

Then that would be Obama of course! He is graying out a bit. The gray always adds to prestige, of course.

I think the problem with Bill was tying up the runways at LAX while getting his hair styled. Pretty lame.

No airplanes were delayed. So who cares if he sat on the ground getting a haircut. I'd rather get one on the ground than in the air too.

Yes and no. Good point though. It does state that the reports were heavily overblown.

I live in NYC though, and I will state that Clinton regularly screwed up both Highway and Air traffic with his visits here. Something Bush was much better about.

According to Federal Aviation Administration records obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, the May 18 haircut caused no significant delays of regularly scheduled passenger flights - no circling planes, no traffic jams on the runways.

Commuter airlines that fly routes reportedly affected by the president's haircut confirmed they have no record of delays that day.

The FAA records, generated by the regional Air Route Traffic Control Center, show that an unscheduled air taxi flight had the only delay attributed to the closure of two runways for an hour in anticipation of Air Force One's departure. The air taxi took off 17 minutes after leaving the gate -- two minutes late, by FAA accounting.

"If you understand the air traffic system, you'd find that statement [that planes were circling] ludicrous," said Fred O'Donnell, an FAA spokesman at the agency's Western-Pacific regional office, which responded to New York Newsday's May 21 request under the freedom of information law.

O'Donnell said that although two runways were closed, traffic was light that afternoon and arriving flights were simply diverted to the two other runways. "It did not cause any problems," he said.

However, an air-traffic controller union official said the runway closings did increase the workload in the control centers. "If you close two runways, you take away 50 percent of the capacity and increase the complexity by 100 percent," said Karl Grundmann, regional vice president for the union.

O'Donnell said the FAA records an arrival delay if controllers take any action to slow traffic approaching the airport, such as having the pilot circle the airport. A departure delay is recorded whenever it takes an aircraft more than 15 minutes to take off after having pushed off from the gate.

During the uproar over the haircut, an unidentified FAA spokesperson was quoted in wire service reports as saying that a flight from Yuma, Ariz., to Los Angeles was delayed 25 minutes, a flight arriving from Palmdale, Calif., was delayed 17 minutes and several other flights were delayed about 10 minutes. No airlines were identified, but these details were widely repeated by news media, including New York Newsday.

OK, one plane was delayed 2 minutes.

Eh, I feel no outrage coming on....
 
 
A little more than that, when you check into the filtering, which is always an abuse of power issue. You are right though, that it was blown out of proportion. Here in NYC the Clinton Travel Plans did regularly wreak havoc.

Because of Bill's haircuts?

I saw him on booktv today promoting his book... he seems to have let his hair grow a good bit since not being in office. Perhaps book sales are not so good that he can afford to get his hair cut?   I'd do his hair for free

If they had any I'd agree with you.

Sorry Ravster, but these days it takes a lot more than just a witty thread win to earn my rep.  

My last 20 reps given on my CP list spans back to 8/4. Apparently the running theme seems to be things relating to Ron Paul favorability, or at least something along the lines of libertarian viewpoints.

That kind of leaves you out, huh?

If that doesn't work, I give up on you and your gay fetish for Ronnie.
