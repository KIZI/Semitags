Guys – am I missing something on the site??

I had the selling phone call from ECF a week ago with the free access for £2
for a month and then £40 for the complete year.

The selling point was that there would be live commentary of each match
(which would not interest me) and a video archive of all old matches from
the past six seasons.

I went on this morning expecting to find video footage of the Weymonth game
from Monday – all I can find is footage from the 2001/2002 and 2002/2003
season!

Am I being a ‘silly billy’ and just not found it, of is is simply not there
??
