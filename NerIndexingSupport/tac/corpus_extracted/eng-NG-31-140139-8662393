All, some VERY good news. Wycombe Wanderers FC has agreed to host a Fans
United  Safe Standing Day at its home match on Sunday 9  September 2007
kick-off  1.30pm. This game is live on Sky.

WE NEED HUNDREDS OF FANS FROM OTHER CLUBS DESCENDING  ON WYCOMBE THAT DAY
DRESSED IN CLUB COLOURS!

This is IMPORTANT. Drop everything, get on to all your football mates, club
websites/message-boards and spread the word NOW!

Let Amanda Matthews (ajm22769@yahoo. <mailto:ajm22769%40yahoo.co.uk> co.uk)
or me  know about your attendance and how many you'll be bringing. Let's
turn Wycombe into a football United Nations for the day, make it a great day
out for everybody. Both SUSD and the FSF are fully behind this. The club
will be invited all the other 91 clubs and all the 145 MPs who have signed
the pro safe-standing House of Commons Early Day Motion.

GO FOR IT PEOPLE, HIT THE PHONES/EMAIL NOW!

All, just to add to Steven's message, Wycombe are really pushing the boat
out media wise and it would help if we could add a high profile name(s) to
the guest list. If anybody reading this knows anybody who may be interested
in coming along and lending their support to the cause, please do let me
know.

Credit also goes to Thames Valley Police. The event was uncertain at first
as TVP wanted to show up in numbers and charge the club £3,000 for their
presence. Thanks to some obviously superb negotiation on behalf of Wycombe
and the co-operation of TVP, the event will policed as normal - probably two
bored looking coppers!

Hope to meet some of you on the 9th.
