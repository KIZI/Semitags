A man is taking a walk in Central park in New York .

Suddenly he sees a little girl being attacked by a pit bull dog.

He runs over and starts fighting with the dog. He succeeds in killing
the

dog and saving the girl's life.

A policeman who was watching the scene walks over and says: "You are

a hero, tomorrow you can read it in all the newspapers: "Brave New

Yorker saves the life of little girl".

The man says: "But I am not a New Yorker!"

Oh then it will say in newspapers in the morning:

Brave American saves life of little girl" the policeman answers.

"But I am not an American!" - says the man. Oh, what are you then?"

The man says: "I am a Pakistani!"

The next day the newspapers say: "A Terrorist kills innocent American
dog".
