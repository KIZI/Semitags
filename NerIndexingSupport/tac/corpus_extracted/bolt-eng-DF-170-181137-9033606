Yep.
 
 
 
Yep.

 

To be fair, technically, every team left has a chance of winning.  

Personally, I think the Jets will lose and lose big next week to San Diego. San Diego is red hot, have won the last 11 straight, and are playing at home. IMAO there's simply no way the lowly Jets are going to beat them.

My Predictions for next week:

Jets get dominated by San Diego and lose by at least 20 points
Colts choke and lose to the surging Ravens by 3pts or less
Minnesota easily dispatches Dallas by 7-14 pts
Arizona squeaks past New Orleans in the best match-up of the weekend.

Good Luck!!
 
 
 
I'm picking the Jets to win the Super Bowl

 

I'm picking my ass.

I'm also picking Chargers, Ravens, Cowboys, Saints.
 
 
 
Yep.

 

Hope you aren't putting money on that bet. Hell, I don't see the Jets making it to the Superbowl, let alone winning that game.

Actually, putting a little bit of money down on a longshot, and I do mean longshot, might just pay off.

I'm going with Chargers, Ravens, Vikings and Cardinals.

I suspect Manning will choke once again.

Maybe the longshot bet should be on the Ravens?

Longshot ehh? LOL, no problem, I have been a Lion's fan for my whole life. I should put 5 bucks on them every year. Sure it would be like throwing it away, but if somehow they actually won it all...I'd be a millionare.

Having grown up in the SF Bay Area and being a fan of the Niners and the Raiders, I am feeling much the same way, lately.

Someday... someday!

My experience is that people who don't know the game usually pick the winner... It has something to do with beginner's luck.

So, who are you picking this year?

Immie

PS I'm holding my bet until I get an answer.
 
 
Paulie

You were 0-4 last week, right?
 
 
i have no clue other than the jets (due to the title of this thread) who is playing...and its not just pick a team..there is a grid...you select a square...looks a lot like math to me....but hey that is just me....but each year they come up and i have to say i dont play...i am not gonna tell them i dont know how..they will mock me to death....they are all football people...fantasy football...which by now even i understand due to the hours of texting over this....(one of my close friends has a league)..but not this pool thing and there is more than one....and the top amounts are nice..500 in one...
 
 
i have been told to put my money on baltimore....apparently not the colts....(you should see the look i just got)
 
 
uh oh...seems asking one question....i still am not sure who is playing....but suddenly i am being lectured on this subject....
 
 
The Jets have the best defense in the NFL, and a great running game. This kid Green looks great.

Defense and running games win championships. I'm sticking by my pick.

Sanchez did well against Cincinnati, and they have a good defense. Maybe he's not so bad afterall.
 
 
 
Paulie

You were 0-4 last week, right?

 

Yeah, but in my defense, 1 of those was because I can't bet against my team, and another one was losing the Green Bay game. Most had GB picked to win. Otherwise, I pretty much knew the Eagles were going to lose. So I should have been at least 2-2.

I should have known better than to pick NE especially with Welker out. I was literally given like 5 seconds to make my picks, it was a last second thing at the end of the work day on Saturday when everyone was leaving the job. I had no time to put any thought into it.

I like the Jets, and I stick by my pick.

Typically the way those grids work is that there are 100 squares in 10 rows X 10 columns, numbered 0 to 10.

You buy one or more square.

If the home team's score ends in a 1 (row) and the visiting teams score ends in a 7 (column), the person who had row the person on row number 1 column 7 wins. They also generally pay by quarter and by half.

You want to pick spots like (7,7), (1,7) or (0,9) because scores are going to be based upon TD's 7 points and FG's 3 so scores like 7-3, 7-7, 14-7, 21-10 are good squares to have while squares with 5 or 8 are more difficult to attain. It is rare that a team will have a score ending in 5, but not impossible.

Arizona over the Saints.

Colts beat Ravens

San Diego over the Jets.

Cowboys - Vikings too close to call...one will win by a field goal.

I think they will be a tough out. You are correct in that a good running game and defense can take you a long way. I'm not sure if Sanchez can take them all the way.

They match up well with San Diego. San Diego is an aerial team and allowed 4.5 YPG on the ground this year. But going across the country after playing three must-win games and the next against the hottest team in the NFL at the moment may be too much.

I'm picking all the home teams again, but if all the road teams win, it would not be a surprise.

The thing about the Cowboys, however, is that I'm not sure if they can handle the pressure. It seems that whenever they get all the hype, they don't do well, but when everyone forgets about them, they come on strong. It seems that when I listen to the pundits on the game, most are picking the Cowboys.

They are on a 4-game winning streak and playing well, but the games they won are interesting. They beat a Saints team that was beginning to sputter even though they were 13-0, they beat a woeful Redskins team, then beat the Eagles twice in a row, which may be more idiosyncratic than anything. Collinsworth during the game said that "In the NFC East, the Cowboys beat the Eagles twice, the Eagles beat the Giants twice, the Giants beat the Cowboys twice, and everybody beat the Redskins."

I do think the Vikings-Cowboys game will be close as Dallas does present some match-up problems for Minnesota. However, the likewise is also true, and you could see how if Dallas falls behind early, it could be a blow-out.
 
 
 
Yep.

 

You are really Rex Ryan?
 
 
I hope Paulie is right....

Look at the Super Bowl winners over the last 10 years. There are a few in there that had no shot on paper at the beginning. Who thought Eli could actually win the SB? Who thought Brad Johnson would win the SB?? Who thought Trent Dilfer would win the super bowl?? How about Roethlisberger, or Brady? Those 2 were good QB's, but they were very young and had no playoff experience when they won their first SB.

Those teams won because of defense and running.

The Jets D can stack the box against LT and Revis can easily shut down Jackson. If the Chargers win it'll be with Gates. If the Jets can stop Gates and the run, they can win this game.

I don't necessarily disagree, but both Brad Johnson and Trent Dilfer were veterans in their 30s whereas Sanchez is a rookie. No rookie QB has won the Super Bowl that I am aware of.

Adios Rex, its over.

I'm so confident about it that I'll not only rock a really embarrassing avatar if I lose, but I'll publicly make a thread about myself stating how much of a loser I am and that I will never discuss football again.

You guys are free to come to a consensus on whatever avatar you would want me to rock.

You cant really put your reputation on the line. Unless you have like ten character references all notarized and verified by reliable channels.

But the never discuss football part is interesting. I dont know if you are a football fan and post often for that statement to matter. Now are you really a man of your word? Never post about football again? You have to admit most people ONLINE talk out their ass. So I find it hard to believe you. Or the JETS are going to win.

I can put my rep on the line, I've been posting here for 3 years and have a relationship of some sort with a lot of posters here. And yes, I'm a football fan, and I do talk about it here. I'm a bigger baseball fan though, so not talking football anymore wouldn't exactly ruin my life  

This is all for fun of course, but it's a wager I'm willing to make.

As far as Sanchez, I don't think he really needs to do all that much. I think the D and the running game will compliment what little he'll have to do on his own, very nicely.

I was a critic of Sanchez earlier in the year, but I think he's got enough of what it would take for this particular team to win.

I'm also a huge Buddy Ryan fan, being that I'm a life long Eagles fan, so seeing Rex win the big one would be pretty cool.

Wow, I admire that really. I guess with me there have been those times where i thought a team would win and they did. For the most I just dont say for I dont have that confidence you have. But when I know what i am talking about I do. I just am trying to understand you could lose. And you say you are a man of your word. And not talking football would ruin you. How you can make that bet?

Then that part about this all just for fun. But will wager.
 
 
I misread. You said not talking about football would not ruin you. Now I can understand you making that bet. Want to apologise for wasting your time and space on this forum.

Like I said mother fuckers, DEFENSE and RUNNING.

It's the equivalent of good pitching in baseball. It's the better formula almost every single time.

Also, 4/4 on my picks this week, and I'm a couple points back from the leader with this Jets win.

Next up, YOU, EZ...

It is ON !
 
 
I still don't think the Jets are going to win, but they'll give the Colts a good game.

Outside of New York, the happiest people in NFL-land has to be the Colts, given that the Chargers have beaten them the last three times they've played in the playoffs, including twice in Indy.

The Chargers beat themselves more than anything today. Dumb penalties, turnovers, missed FGs. That's a tough assignment when you are playing a really good defense.
 
 
Turnovers aren't always a result of you beating yourself.

It's going to be a very similar looking offense next week. No running game to have to focus on. Only difference is Manning is better than Rivers.
 
 
Defense wins championships! A top notch D can always stop a top notch O. Regardless if the Jets lose next week, I can't be upset...playing in the AFC Championship with a rookie QB and Head coach...what a fucking year!

Jets got further then i thought they would.

It seems they have that NY mojo going on now.
 
 
There's a pretty significant amount of money at stake in my pool so I'm torn whether or not to take the Jets in THAT. I think the Colts will be tougher than the Chargers, even though I think it's a similar looking offense.

What a tough decision. Maybe I'll pick the Colts so my bet is hedged either way. I lose that, I still win here  
 
 
Last night I was watching the Late Night Sports recap on our local news. They were saying how "fun" Rex Ryan is and what great interviews he gives. They are looking forward to having him here in town, I think EVERYONE likes him, how can you not? He's done a GREAT job this year with the Jets, and has a personality that motivates his players. If they weren't playing the Colts I would pull for them to win for sure! And if they beat the Colts I will root for them to win the Superbowl!

I still LOL at his phone calls to the Jets ticket holders before the Pats game, and they ended up winning that game, remember?  
 
 
Rex Ryan. Buddy is his father, the great Eagles coach of the late 80's and early 90's.

They have defense running through their veins. This Jets D reminds me a lot of the early 90's Eagles D, too.
 
 
The Jets winning The Superbowl? Nothing but pipe dreams bro. They don't even stand a chance against The Colts. There party ends this weekend. ~BH
