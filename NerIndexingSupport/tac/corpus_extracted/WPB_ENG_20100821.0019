    A Washington Post article about the verdict in the corruption trial of former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich incorrectly said that Blagojevich (D) was impeached last year by the Illinois Senate. The state Senate held an impeachment trial, but it was the state House that voted to impeach Blagojevich.
