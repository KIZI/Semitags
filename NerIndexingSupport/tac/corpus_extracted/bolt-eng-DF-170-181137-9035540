 
 
Greatest NFL Team Of All-Time
 
 
Whose your candidate for greatest NFL team of all-time?

Most people will say the 72 Dolphins for obvious reasons. Me? I have to go with the 85 Bears. I'm not a Chicago fan but I have mad respect for that squad. That team had the absolte best and monstorous defense. The ole 46. Buddy Ryan, whom I'm not a fan of, made this formation extremely popular. It was an enigma for offenses to figure out. It stayed that until Walsh and the West Coast offense exposed it. It's vulnerable to short passing plays. It's why you rarely see it anymore. That and few teams have the impact players to run it.

The 85 Bears' defense had some absolute monsters. Singletary, Dent, Hampton, Marshall, Perry, Wilson, Duerson, etc...

On offense they had the greatest RB and football player this planet has ever seen, Walter Payton.

Whose your best team ever and why?

 
 
 
The 85 Bears were the best defense I ever saw but I think the most dominant all-round team I've seen was the 49ers a few years later than beat Denver 55-10 in the Super Bowl. I was too young to remember the great teams of the 70s.

The 85 Dolphins beat the 85 Bears.  
 
 
Greenbay Packers are hands down the greatest team in the history of football!

HELLO!  
 
 
The 2000 Ravens defense was every bit as dominant as the 85 Bears... but neither were a complete team... and I can't put either into the argument

72 Dolphins?? Bah.... more luck than complete substance

I think it has to come down to a choice between 4 teams... The 62 Packers who utterly defined dominant.... The 89 49ers were a complete team on offense and defense, and who can't love Montana as the quintessential leader?... The 76 Raiders who were possibly the meanest, nastiest bunch of players to ever be on the same field for the same team (on both sides of the ball)... And the 58/59 Baltimore Colts who were just loaded from top to bottom with Unitas at the pinnacle of his career
 
 
IN 1969 I'd have to say the best NFL football team was the AFL Jets.

That's the last time I paid any attention to the game to be honest.
 
 
The 2007 Patriots.

Hands down.

Yes, they lost the Super Bowl...with a hurt quarterback. But they were a force to be reckoned with on both sides of the ball.

In fact, it'd be more accurate just to say the 2001-2007 Patriots. They've been a dominating force for the better part of this decade.
 
 
one of the cowboy teams when they had the triplets
 
 
My nominee would be the 1967 Packers.

If I were to choose one from my lifetime, It would be any one of Bill Walsh's superbowl teams. The 49'ers were dominant in the late 80's and early 90's.
 
 
The 2009 New England Patriots.

Remember where you heard it first.

Key words bolded

They were not even the best in their season... let alone belonging on any list for greatest of all time

Many of the modern teams would be quivering facing the toughness of teams past without the little mamby-pamby rules they have in place now.. Moss would be crying like a bitch when clotheslined by Night Train Lane... Brady or Peyton would be a nervous wreck after being crushed and gouged while down by Butkus or Nitschke... the older greats may not have had the physical advantages some training provides now, but they were a much tougher breed even just 20 years ago

They beat the Giants once in their season. Tom Brady suffered an ankle injury but played the Super Bowl in spite of that. Had he been at 100%, it may have gone down differently.
 
 
 
The 2009 New England Patriots.

Remember where you heard it first.

 

Agreed, Tom Brady out for revenge on the NFL two-fold.

I would hate to be KC next time you play Tom Brady. He might be going for a 100 on the scoreboard.  
 
 
The 72 Dolphins. No question in my mind.

Had pixie dust sprinkled from tinker bell's ass fallen from the sky to bless the Pats it may have been different too...

The key is it was not... they were not the best team and lost the game outright... they were the second best team in the league that year
 
 
 
The 2009 New England Patriots.

Remember where you heard it first.

 

Are they replacing their entire defense? Without it, even having Brady back at 200% won't do any good.

Yeah, they missed the video tape. The 72 Phins WERE a complete team.

The Giants beating the Pats last year, that miracle catch,,,it was Karma biting them in the butt, and it was SWEET!
 
 
We've had this argument before, and not long ago. The topic is subjective and I'll say the same thing now I said then:

You can't compare teams now with teams "then." The rules are too different, the game too different and the players too different. The players then couldn't keep up with the speed today, and the players of today would all be broken into pieces by 3rd down playing the older players by their rules.

I don't even watch it anymore it's so wussified.
 
 
I find it hard to judge a team on a single season.

The Pittsburgh team from 75-80 were a powerhouse.

The Raiders teams of that era as well had a fearsome reputation that many say was worth 7 points on the board.

San Francisco in the mid to late 80s were an outstanding team.

And of course the Packers in the 60s.
 
 
The '72 Dolphins had the easiest schedule in the league that year and it was before the regular season was expanded to 17 games
 
 
62' Packers!
 
 
Cmon people, these are not even close to the greatest teams. If they were, explain why.

The greatest team was clearly the 49ers of the late 80s early 90s.

You had joe montana as starting quarterback greatest of all time, steve young as backup (6 td passes in one super bowl)! Jerry rice the greatest reciever of all time, you had bill romanowski, you had ronnie lot greatest safety of all time. You had rodger craig. in 93 you had deon sanders, you had ken norton jr., you had gary plummer, you had bryant young, you had ricky waters..... All the greats.

They were a balanced team but I am not sure they had a dominant defense. Actually, I can't remember back that far!

psst: The smoking gun memo that clarified the taping rule was issued a week prior to the 2006 season. The Pats 3 Super Bowls were after the 2001, 2003 and 2004 seasons. You do the math smart guy.  
 
 
 
before the regular season was expanded to 17 games

 

When did they expand it to 17 games? Did I miss something? They extended it to 17 weeks but teams play 16 games.

Jerry should have never gone to Seattle! He should have retired on top!
I used to take care of a guy who played for the San Fran in the 40's, coolest guy who would ever meet!
ANd speaking of reciervers Steve Largent never got to prove himself completly!

Then he had to play my Bucs. There's another all-time great D.

I think he was confused by the number of games the Dolphins won. They only played 14 regular season games then, and the Dolphins were 17-0 including the off season. The 16 game regular season began in 1978.

I've heard talk of their wanting to expand the regular season again.

Walter Payton was not the greatest RB. Had Barry Sanders not retired prematurely, he would easily be the greatest. I still consider him to be, anyway. The man had no o-line, and he probabably had just as many lateral yards as positive yards. He and Payton had one thing in common though, class. Neither would celebrate a TD, they would simply hand the ball to the ref and walk away.

And although I hate him, you have to make a case for Emmitt.
 
 
 
The '72 Dolphins had the easiest schedule in the league that year and it was before the regular season was expanded to 17 games

 

And their starting quarterback, Griese, was out for 10 of those games and the team was led by Earl Morrall who was older than dirt, even then. Griese didnt come back until the first playoff games.

Don't know where you get that easiest schedule crap from. Nobody was beating them. Period. They beat the best teams to get to the Superbowl and they won the Superbowl. Same standard every team is judged by.

Nope. The 74 Steelers would have killed them. The 71 Cowboys would have killed them. The 68 Packers would have killed them.

Walter Payton was not the greatest RB.

 

Bullshit. I'll fight anyone to the death over that. There's a few certainties in life...Pink Floyd is the greatest band, Long Island Iced Teas are God's nectar, pussy is the greatest invention and Walter Payton is the greatest RB in the galaxy.

Oh, and about your Emmitt Smith comment...I don't think he is a top 3 RB. I'm a Gator fan and still don't buy it. Smith had the luxuary of playing behind a top-class O-line for many, many years. Didn't hurt he had Aikman/Irving to take the pressure off him. I'd put Sanders and Brown over Smith.

Here's to you, sweetness. You're the classiest man I ever saw. RIP, bro. This is an excellent video of Walter Payton. Love this.
 
 
Also for you NFL fans. Holmberg has been talking to the 49's! I guess the Seahawks are sending their latest outcaste to San Fran again!

We'll see. He's denying the rumors but who knows. I think they need to let Singletary do his thing and give him an honest look.

 
RENTON, Wash. -- So much for Mike Holmgren's quiet motorcycle ride into that self-described "sabbatical" next year.

The exiting coach of the skidding Seattle Seahawks had a chance on Wednesday to slam the door on rumors he is a prime candidate to take over his hometown San Francisco 49ers in 2009.

Instead, he left it partially open.

"When I was at Lincoln High School, and for years, that was my dream job. And it never quite came to fruition," Holmgren said to members of the San Francisco media in a conference call. "But times change and right now, I think it's been stated... for the 27th time: the plan for me and Kath [wife Kathy] is to take a year off after this time in Seattle. We've been here 10 years, and we love it here, and that's the plan.

"While I'm flattered -- we have a lot of friends in the Bay Area -- that's the plan right now," he said.

San Francisco and Seattle are abuzz with rumors Holmgren is the prime candidate to lead the 49ers next season. San Francisco (2-5) fired coach Mike Nolan this week and replaced him with Mike Singletary on an interim basis, beginning Sunday against the last-place Seahawks (1-5).

When he agreed to come back for his 10th and final season in Seattle in January, Holmgren promised his longtime wife he would spend at least 2009 away from football to spend time with a family that includes six grandchildren -- and ride his motorcycle.

"All the things that I haven't been able to do for the last 40 years or so," said Holmgren, who is tied with Joe Gibbs for 10th all-time with 171 victories.

When talking to Seattle's media earlier Wednesday, Holmgren sounded disappointed to be asked about whether the 49ers job would cause him to reconsider his future.

"You are really going to ask this... Right now, the plan is to stay with the plan I told you: We're going to take the year off, find out a little bit about myself. And that's the plan right now," Holmgren said.

Of course, when he hatched this plan with his wife in January, he never imagined losing starting quarterback Matt Hasselbeck, still out indefinitely with knee and back issues, and seven wide receivers to injuries.

He never dreamed his four-time defending division champions would be at the bottom of the NFC West two months into the season.

And he never fathomed his former "dream job" will apparently be available just as he becomes free from his obligations in Seattle.

When asked if his wife would allow him to skip that promised sabbatical should the perfect football situation arise next year, Holmgren said: "You know what, right now she is doing foot care at [Seattle's] Pike Street clinic for the homeless. I am not going to burden her with that right now.

"It is something we spoke about prior to the season, I'll stick with what I said and I would rather not deal in hypotheticals right now. One, Mike Nolan is an acquaintance and a friend of mine, and I feel bad for him. Two, we are going to go down and play the 49ers, and the important thing is the game with the 49ers. I'd rather not. Let's hold off on all that stuff right now, OK?" he said.

Holmgren was a prep athlete of the year at San Francisco's Lincoln High School in 1965. He was a high school coach and history teacher in the city during the early 1970s. In 1986, Bill Walsh brought him into the NFL out of BYU to be his quarterbacks coach with the 49ers. He is building a new, second home in Santa Cruz, Calif., south of the Bay Area.

Scot McCloughan, the 49ers' general manager, was the Seahawks' director of college scouting before moving to San Francisco. Holmgren said he has a "good relationship" with "Scotty... or Scot, I should say now."

Yet he didn't want to dwell on any of that Wednesday.

"Look it, this is my home. Seattle is my home. This is my team," Holmgren said of the Seahawks, who will become coach Jim Mora's team in a few months. "Right now, we've got to figure out how to win a game here for the Seattle Seahawks. Then all the rest of this stuff is... speculation.

"Things in this crazy business change on a day-to-day basis," he said.

Yeah! He said he won't talk about it now, that the Seahawks need to get a win! My thoughts exactly. Every football team in washington sucks right now. WSU didn't even score any points against USC!
I guess we will see! I wonder who the Seahawks are going to get since he is for sure leaving!

I'm a Gator fan but always root for Gonzaga's B-ball team when they aren't playing my boys. They always do pretty decent in the tournament. Besides, my favorite basketball player of all-time went to Gonzaga. NBA all-time assist and steal leader, not to mention a sniper on the edge. Here's a bad-ass player.

My neices are actually good friends with his daugher and have played bball with her for the last four years. My bro has actually seen his two gold medals! I live in Spokane where he is from, he is saint here. Another cool thing is he lets my brother use is court side seats at Gonzaga games! My dad almost pissed his pants when he got to meet him at one of my neices bball games!

I AM JEALOUS of your brother! I bet your dad was thrilled to meet him, what basketball fan wouldn't be? I'm glad to hear he's as nice of a guy as I have heard, kind of like " The Admiral"-David Robinson. He's my ALL TIME favorite player, just a great man, a great player, and a great role model.

He is actually very quiet but he has done a lot for youth bball here in Spokane, opening a new place for them to play. He was my neices coach one year with my brother of course they won their championship! Now their coaches are the two guys who coached him when he was younger. This is their select team.

That team had the absolte best and monstorous defense. The ole 46. Buddy Ryan, whom I'm not a fan of, made this formation extremely popular. It was an enigma for offenses to figure out. It stayed that until Walsh and the West Coast offense exposed it. It's vulnerable to short passing plays. It's why you rarely see it anymore. That and few teams have the impact players to run it.

Agree 100% with everything you said. 85 Bears hands down.

And yeah, John Stockton was the shit. Him and Karl Malone are without a doubt the greatest duo in NBA history.

Funny story. One Sunday when the Jazz were playing the Bulls in one of their two championship finals with them, Karl Malone, nicknamed the "Mailman," was going to the foul line for a critical shot late in the game. As they were lining up for it Scottie Pippen was walking by Malone and said, "The mailman doesn't deliver on Sunday's."

the Zags should also be good this year, quite a bit of returing players and the ones they recuited a few years ago are said to going to finally pay off!

As running back go, Sanders would have broken every record in the book if he had not retired. He was also the classiest guy on the field. He scored, he handed the ball to the ref, and then he sat on the bench.

You'll get no argument from me there... I think Sanders was the most amazing RB I ever saw
 
 
The RB debate is always a good one quite simply because it's soooooo subjective. Nobody dominated the game like Jim Brown. Nobody was harder to take down than Earl Campbell. Nobody was harder to lay a hand on than Barry Sanders. And stats can be misleading too. Personally, the best running back I ever saw, in his few prime years before catastrophic injury, was Terrell Davis. And I fucking hate the Broncos!
