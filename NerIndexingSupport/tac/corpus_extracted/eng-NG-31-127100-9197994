Football FINALLY Makes
Sense.........

A guy took his blonde girlfriend to her first football game. They had
great seats right  behind their team's bench.
After the game, he asked her how she liked the experience.  "Oh, I
really liked it," she replied, "especially the tight pants  and all
the big muscles, but I just couldn't understand why they  were killing
each other over 25 cents."

Dumbfounded, her date asked, "What do you mean?"

"Well, they flipped  a coin, one team got it and then for the rest of
the game, all they  kept screaming was: 'Get the quarterback! Get the
quarterback!' I'm like ...  Helloooooo? It's only 25 cents!!!!

I wonder if the BC Lions would have had better luck today in the CFL
Western Final if they'd have tried to get the quarter back instead of
the quarterback. (For all you non-Canadians, the CFL, or Canadian
Football League, is by far the best football played anywhere in the
world :) )
