The only good thing about the Red Sox winning is that is pisses off Skankee
fans.

Actually, I do like Schilling, Youkilis, and the bunch.  Coming back from
3-1this year after coming back 3-0 in 2004 is pretty amazing.

Thank god I don't have to deal day-in-day-out with any Boston fans.  With
the Sox in the series, Patriots class of the NFL, Boston College at #2, and
the Celtics resurgent they must be intolerable!

I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for the resurgent Celtics.
Regurgent maybe.  In truth, they are another franchise with all the
advantages it could have and a horrible front office, although no
matter how hard the Celts try the Knicks have them beat hands down in
this department.

I really havent paid attention to the Celtics since Larry retired, but
Pierce, Allen and Garnett??

In one day they went from out of the playoffs to favored to be in the
Eastern Conference finals.

Really? Yah think so? I mean, I'm considering coming out of retirement to be
on their bench, and I would be a significant upgrade! Yeah, it's nice to
have three future hall-of-famers in your starting lineup, but when Brian
Scalabrine is going to get significant minutes, you can't be that excited
about this team.

(trying to rain on the Boston fan's parade, and grasping at straws to do
so...) I mean, really, Brian Scalabrine!

Yeah, but they also have Tony Allen, James Posey, Leon Powe and Eddie
House. Maybe not the best bench in the NBA, but not the worst either.
What they really need right now is some size coming off the bench;
Scott Pollard just ain't gonna cut it.

Okay, I like Tony Allen, but he is coming off a pretty terrible knee injury.
Posey is a decent defender, but past his (brief) prime. Leon Powe was a
freaking amazing college player, but in the NBA he is a tweener (and maybe
even a two-spot tweener, a 5 in a 3's body) that could only play for a team
with a bench as horrible as Boston's. And House is a guy who can score a
little in very limited minutes while shooting a bad percentage and bringing
nothing else to the table...

Add to all that a 4th and 5th starter who are much better suited to being
bench contributors, and while the talent at the top of the roster is pretty
damn amazing, 4-12 is as poor a collection of athletes as has ever been seen
on an NBA roster.

Allen has looked very good physically so far and is said to be well
ahead of where they thought he'd be by now. If he gets close to 100%,
he could develop into one of the top sixth men in the league. Before
he got hurt last year, he was averaging around 20 ppg for a
significant stretch of games. Posey is only 30, so he's hardly over
the hill, especially since they're only looking for about 20 minutes a
game from him. Yeah, Powe is undersized, but if you watched him at all
last year you know he'll hustle, rebound, pick up a few garbage points
and play decent D. That's really all they expect or need from him.
House is definitely limited in what he can do, but how many fourth
guards are much better?

Like I said, if the Celts can upgrade the backup center position I
think they're bench will be adequate or better. If not, then Garnett
is going to have to play a lot more center than they'd like. And I
believe they still have some money available to bring in another body
if a decent player becomes available after roster cuts.

Pollard? How many teams' seats has he gotten to warm lately? It's amazing
how long someone with size and no talent can stay employed in the league.

Speaking of... I'm checking out of the Mohegan on Saturday morning, and
Calvin Booth walks by me in a Sixers jersey.  Last I knew he was on *my*
team, the Wiz.  Must've missed that one.

(Interesting hotel desk there... I see Jackie Greene checking out minutes
before the Sixers check in)

Yeah, I like Allen a lot and will be rooting for him to get back to 100%
this year, although after an inury like that, I'm not sure he'll ever regain
all of the explosiveness he had prior to the injury.

 

For your 7-9 men, those are just not very good players, especially if you
think you are contenders to win the conference.

 

I dunno. I just don't see the Celts being able to upgrade in terms of depth
up front. They have no trade bait, and there just aren't a whole lot of
teams that are going to be cutting big men who are more talented than, say,
Scot Pollard (who, it must be said, I think is getting a bit of a bad rap in
this thread. He is certainly no all-star, but he is a serviceable big man to
provide 10-12 minutes of not completely sucking per game)...

Man, that was easy.  The Celtics, with their "big three" became
instant favorites in the east.  Meanwhile, the Knicks will undoubtedly
give Isiah Thomas a contract extension to help defray his legal
expenses and as a reward for being more hated than Jim Dolan.
