No contest...just post who you think will win this weekend.

WAS @ SEA - Seahawks, of course

JAX @ PIT - Jaguars.  I like the Jags in this one...they match up well
against the Steelers, who are missing Parker.

NYG @ TB - Buccaneers.  I'll go with history on this one...the Giants
have been getting into the playoffs and losing in the first round for years
now.  In 2005, they won their division and got bitch-slapped by the
Panthers.  In 2006, they were a wild-card and got bitch-slapped by the
Eagles.  Coughlin appears to be the poor man's Schottenheimer.  They may be
rough around the edges from injury, but I think the Bucs will win this one
at home.

TEN @ SD - Chargers.  I don't think Fisher's got a prayer in this
one...they got the last spot because Indy didn't care enough to smack them
down.  That kind of luck doesn't hold when the games start to count again.
