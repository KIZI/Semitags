The American and British empires are indeed to blame for a lot of this stuff. For some reason all that talk in the past about the West being the beacon of hope, freedom and peace (the kind of rhetoric that marked the Enlightenment) has gone for nought. Something has gone terribly wrong. Not only are we terrorising other countries and other nations, now we are terrorising our own people, not with weapons, but with propaganda, media manipulation, false flag operations and advertising.

One wonders here who are the bad guys. I'm starting to think that we are the bad guys.
 
 
 
 
What if propping up repressive regimes in the Middle East endangers both the United States and Israel?

What if occupying countries like Iraq and Afghanistan – and bombing Pakistan – is directly related to the hatred directed toward us and has nothing to do with being free and prosperous?

What if someday it dawns on us that losing over 5,000 American military personnel in the Middle East since 9/11 is not a fair trade-off for the loss of nearly 3,000 American citizens, no matter how many Iraqi, Pakistani, and Afghan people are killed or displaced?

What if we finally decide that torture, even if called “enhanced interrogation techniques,” is self-destructive and produces no useful information – and that contracting it out to a third world nation is just as evil?
What if the American people woke up and understood that the official reasons for going to war are almost always based on lies and promoted by war propaganda in order to serve special interests?

What if we as a nation came to realize that the quest for empire eventually destroys all great nations?

What if the American people learn the truth: that our foreign policy has nothing to do with national security and that it never changes from one administration to the next?

What happens if my concerns are completely unfounded – nothing!

What happens if my concerns are justified and ignored – nothing good!

True!
 
 
I agree with all the above posts! Sorry I couldnt posively rep as I dont have any left  
 
 
It's either that or the Taliban.

You can't eat a cake and have it too.
 
 
What about the Taliban?
 
 
But the Taliban terrorise their own people as well, so doesn't that mean they are evil?
 
 
 
What about the Taliban?

 

So lets take this down to bare basics. Would you prefer the Taliban regime to still be in control of Afghanistan?

Would you prefer the Baathist regime to still be in control of Iraq?
 
 
Exactly stop the cuba blockade!!!!
 
 
What I want to know is why so many leftist apologists treat the Muslim world as unthinking animals with no responsibility?

Your rather tiresome anti-Americanism borders on racism against those pitiful brown folk who know not what they are doing as they plant improvised explosive devices that butcher a supermarket of innocent Iraqi families. Or create mass graves in downtown Manhattan with passenger jet missiles.

Everything is always the fault of the 'west' regardless of the fact that those who liberated and supported the liberation recognise the complexity of society in that region, especially the fact that the vast, vast majority of its inhabitants are not fanatical barbarians. They are simply individuals like you and I who do not want to live under a regime that slaughters women and children who dare learn how to read a book.

There are far more admirable principles to which one can subscribe that mean if the US decides to once more back tyrannical dictators in actual pursuit of mineral wealth and control of poorer countries. It is still possible to stand against it with equal vehemence.

Your principles are simply irrational and lacking reason. The same goes for Chomsky and Ron Paul. They may have had a point prior to the early nineties but now they are simply fossils pandering to crowd of sheep-like disciples.
 
 
I blame it on Dragovich, Kravchenko and Steiner.

Where's Mason when we need him??

It's more than that.

For them Altruism is seen as a virtue while acting out of self interest is inherently evil.

So even if they wouldn't want the Taliban back and would prefer to see them gone, they don't want someone who acts out of self interest to make them gone.

They are evil just like the rest of them. BUT the millions innocent civilians would be alive under their regime and not sexual and physical abused and shot randomly from cars and suffer racism in their own home land. So therfore ther are the lesser evil in my belief.

You clearly know absolutely nothing whatsoever about the Taliban and Baathist regimes because all of that happened and more.

Educate yourself before making innane and unlettered posts on a forum that has seen it all before.

First of all however I would like you to validate your claim that millions have died. As far as I am aware the conservative estimate is around 130,000 and the majority of those deaths were caused by insurgents, after all the biggest killers of the local population in Iraq and Afghanistan are not the armies of the 'west'.

Then I would like you to provide me with evidence that none of the above atrocities occured enmasse under Saddam or the Taliban.

You clearly have no substantial texts on the topic so I suggest you wikipedia/google Saddam's 'rape rooms' and secret police, the mass graves that continued to be exhumed each day, the genocide of Iraqi Kurds namely the massacre at Halabja but also the vicious campaign that swept Iraqi Kurdistan of hundreds and thousands. Perhaps you should also google the mass opression of the Iraqi Shiite population. The links from these topics alone will keep you reading for hours.

As for the Taliban perhaps you can start with something simple like their campaign against the education of women which included the slaughter of those who even attempted to read a book. Then the campaign on music and non-beard wearing men. Then you could move on to the attempted genocide by the Taliban against Afghanistans ethnic Hazara population and the violent repression of all other ethnic minorities. The mass sexual abuse by Taliban officials of young dancing boys and the slaughter of children born to political enemies.

I could go on and on and on you clearly cannot so get reading or just shut up.

You will quickly discover that in actually studying this topic your arguments will be utterly obliterated.

You mean Victoir Reznoz surely:P

Wow, you have zero knowledge of what you're talking about.

First of all, millions did not die in Afghanistan so give it a rest.

Second of all, the Taliban killed more civilians than US forces

Now, what you describe happened under the Taliban, not under US occupation.

They were racist towards Hazara's, randomly beat up people in the street for not having a long enough beard, performed public executions of women accused of adultery without trial, banned them from going to school and getting medical attention, and so on.

Seriously, as a women, how are you not ashamed to say that the Taliban were the lesser of two evils?

And you have the nerve to criticize Israel when you prefer having these bearded apes governing Afghanistan?!
 
 
 
So lets take this down to bare basics. Would you prefer the Taliban regime to still be in control of Afghanistan?

Would you prefer the Baathist regime to still be in control of Iraq?

 

To what extent should interventionism travel? As many nations as possible (an increadible task for a currently indebted and insecure west) - or limited to Afghanistan & Iraq?

 
Everything is always the fault of the 'west'
 

I agree with your comments about leftist apologetics - but part responsiblity has to lie with Western foreign policy when considering events like 9/11. Whether it be the removel of Mohammed Mossadegh, support for Saddam or the propogation of the Taliban - Western governments under the likes of Reagan sowed the seeds for a major backlash. I do however, consider Blair and Bush a rare break from this chain of mistakes - I think they had honorable ambitions for Iraq, and are decent people, whether I support the Iraqi intervention in a pragamatic sense, I'm not so sure.

actually iam dont have great knowledge about what happen in iraq and afghanistan minute by minute but surely it is wrong and evil from the begining to occupy a country and the funny thing is that these conquerors are talking and defending human rights
what a contradiction ??!!
 
 
I think terrorism certainly needs to be stopped, but the mindset that the consequent civilian casualties during war is a case of 'the ends justify the means' is quite a disturbing line of thinking in my view. I'm pretty sure if I was one of the civilians, I would probably not share that view, and so casually tossing lives away, even to stop terrorism, is arrogance and inhumanity of the worst kind

Your arguments are valid but you make a poor assumption, that because NATO is in Afghanistan, the Taliban are not. In the vast majority of the rural country life has not changed one bit in the last 9 years of occupation, girls still do not go to school, people are still oppressed by religious zealots and poverty is rife. One difference is that than there is added bombing and violence brought about by Taliban-coalition fighting which goes about hurting civilians the most.

The aims of the US are highly questionable, if it was to liberate and help the ordinary people as they try and promote, then these last 10 years have been a miserable failure. So much money has been plowed in but almost all of it leaves in the hands of western contractors, other than a select few Afghans that have learnt to play the system most have seen no benefit in the last decade. The Afgahan military force is a third of the size as in communist times, yet the US has had twice as long to train it and a hell of a lot more money. I could go on...

If the real aim in Afghanistan was to help the ordinary people which I guess is what most of the soldiers there and public here keep getting told then it would be an honour. But all that has occurred is a huge amount of pointless deaths and a few people becoming very rich out of it all. This war has been lost and the US are trying to find anyway to get out, once again leaving Afghanistan to civil war, and in the hands of mad men, (I'm sure you know enough history for the last time that happened).

I'm not an apologist for anyone, and believe the Taliban regime was an awful one, but the trouble is, it's not really gone and what has replaced it is in some cases worse for the ordinary Afghan. If you think the deaths and treasure spent there is justified for what we have, then I do not understand your reasoning.
 
 
I've seen it before, an amazing speech!

Have you any idea that you speak utter nonsense ?

In the North of Iraq, Saddam Hussain unleashed thousands of barrels on towns inhabited by Kurds.

Thousands of men, women and children were knocked dead in the streets.

You call that a lesser evil ? Have you seen what the Taliban did in Afghanistan to the massive statue of Buddha ?

Do you know that the Taliban torches girl's schools because apparently women shouldnt be educated ?

It is ignoramuses like you who sow the seeds of dissent against the men and women who give up their lives each day to liberate people from such 'animals' which you describe as lesser evils.

I salute those men and women on the front-line !

I totally agree with you.

And to answer the rest about my view, what Im trying to say MORE people would be alive under the Taliban regime maybe not in freedom but certainly better off than the current war!

By killing thousand INNOCENT civilians in a ILLEGAL war?! There are worser regimes then Afghanistan and Iraq but they are not invaded? You can't justify war for creating peace. It doesn't make sense. Plus Aghanistan and Iraq current governments are still corrupt so what difference has been made?

Then you obviosly do not know enough about what Saddam did to his own people. This is a man who used chemical weapons on his own people you see him as the lesser evil?
 
 
 
By killing thousand INNOCENT civilians in a ILLEGAL war?!

 

You were already told that most civilians were killed by the Taliban and not by NATO forces.

And there's nothing illegal about this war so cut the crap.

At least we're not talking about millions any more...

 
There are worser regimes then Afghanistan and Iraq but they are not invaded? You can't justify war for creating peace. ?
 

Not really, the Taliban are just about as bad as they come. And the worse ones just heavn't been invaded yet, because the west can't be bothered with it.

 
It doesn't make sense. Plus Aghanistan and Iraq current governments are still corrupt so what difference has been made
 

When is the last time you've heard about a women being publicly executed without trial in Afghanistan?

Hasn't happened in years. Girls in Kabul go to school and get medical treatment, so a lot has changed.
 
 
 
I totally agree with you.
!

 

I doubt you understood his argument.

 
And to answer the rest about my view, what Im trying to say MORE people would be alive under the Taliban regime may be not in freedom but certainly better off than the current war
 

Better off?

No. Much much worse off.

You have answered your own question. Afghanistan and Iraq are not the only countries to have been liberated by intervention. Bosnia and Sierra Leonne are two other recent examples. Both countries suffering under a campaign of brutal mass murder and terrorism were rescued through international coalition in the former and British intervention in the latter (Another Tony Blair crusade that the anti-interventionists hate having thrown at them when calling him a criminal)

I am not a utopian I am a pragmatist and realise that realpolitik will dictate which countries can and cannot be liberated. Just because self interest may be involved will not prevent me from supporting a campaign that is largely for the right reasons.

 
I agree with your comments about leftist apologetics - but part responsiblity has to lie with Western foreign policy when considering events like 9/11. Whether it be the removel of Mohammed Mossadegh, support for Saddam or the propogation of the Taliban
 

Listen I am as vehement in my criticism of cold war imperialism as I am the regimes of tin pot dictators. But just because five decades ago we installed tyrants in these countries should not stop us from removing the legacy. In fact it doubles our obligation.

(Also cold war imperialism and imperialism in general is an excellent argument against the claims of Baathist apologists who scream greed when Iraq is bought up. If it was all about greed and vested interest the US would have done what it always did and what every imperial power for the last three millenia has done. It would assasinate the incumbent despot and install a friendly one.)

 
- Western governments under the likes of Reagan sowed the seeds for a major backlash. I do however, consider Blair and Bush a rare break from this chain of mistakes - I think they had honorable ambitions for Iraq, and are decent people, whether I support the Iraqi intervention in a pragamatic sense, I'm not so sure.
 

I agree about Reagan. But are the mistakes of a President who may have been borderline senile a valid justification to sit by in the most peaceful of luxury while millions are tormented, raped and terrorised?

I think we are on the same page. However I do not believe for one second that opposition to cold war imperialism and support for the removal of Saddam Hussein and the Taliban are mutually exclusive.

You are obviouskly not accquainted with Afghan history because a brutal civil war had only ended a few years before western intervention. This civil war included a genocidal campaign against the Hazara population as well as widespread bombing and violence bought about through fighting between taliban and various fuedal fiefdoms.

To expect the whole country to improve drastically in a decade is deluded, doubly so when a militant insurgency of fanatics who have no qualms about the mass murder of their own people seek to demolish everything that is built anew. Improvement will necessarily begin in the urban centres and spread out, the rural example is a very poor one. I quote facts and figures in every single thread about Afghanistan I post in so I will copy and paste them for you.

In Afghanistan? Well the UK alone has spent more than £800 million on development aid and plans to push that figure well above a billion over the next few years.

The UK has donated £40.5m for loans to individuals to set up small businesses as part of a bigger project that has seen more than 440,000 people take up loans.

The UK has donated £32m towards local projects to improve water supply, roads, health and education.

The UK has also spent £30m in Helmand building 59km of roads and more than 1,850 wells. There are plans to build a road from Lashkar Gah to Gereshk and refurbish the Gereshk power plant.

Child immunisation programmes are saving the lives of about 35,000 children a year. In Helmand, where most UK troops are based, a new district hospital and 45 clinics have been built.

New schools have been built: in Helmand there are now 93 schools, up from 34 in 2006. Latest figures¹ show 52% of children enrolled in primary school in 2009, up from 37% in 2005.

nder the Taliban, women were not allowed to vote or work and girls were not allowed to attend school. Rates of literacy and female education are now rising. Enrolled pupil numbers have grown from 1m in 2002 to around 6.6m in 2009 and about a third of those are girls.

All of the above would not have happened under a Taliban regime especially not the female literacy rates. On top of that there would still be regular executions for personal sexual choices and mass persecution of ethnic and religious minorities.

 
The aims of the US are highly questionable, if it was to liberate and help the ordinary people as they try and promote, then these last 10 years have been a miserable failure. So much money has been plowed in but almost all of it leaves in the hands of western contractors,
 

Source? Also that is probably because Afghanistan does not ahve a viable infrastructure thanks to decades of civil war. Who else is going to rebuild the country? Or are you against any kind of help in which the 'west' may make a profit. Even if it means denying the average Afghan worker that these firms employ enough money to feed and clothe his family. Ideologically this is contentious but realistically the shorterm alternative which is what we are working with is far worse.

 
If the real aim in Afghanistan was to help the ordinary people which I guess is what most of the soldiers there and public here keep getting told then it would be an honour. But all that has occurred is a huge amount of pointless deaths and a few people becoming very rich out of it all.
 

Do you really want to play a game of Regime top trumps? Perhaps you should get some perspective.

 
This war has been lost and the US are trying to find anyway to get out, once again leaving Afghanistan to civil war, and in the hands of mad men, (I'm sure you know enough history for the last time that happened).
 

Well it would seem that you don't know enough history at all. The last time the US left the country it had no viable infrastructure at all. It didn't even have a true government let alone a democracy. Merely a gaggle of warlords armed to the teeth left to fight it out. In fact I am interested in how you come to this conclusion.

Please point out the similarities between Afghanistan after the Soviet retreat and Afghanistan right now.

 
I'm not an apologist for anyone, and believe the Taliban regime was an awful one, but the trouble is, it's not really gone and what has replaced it is in some cases worse for the ordinary Afghan.
 

How exactly? You still haven't told me. The pitiful points above ahve been refuted one by one by one. If you seriously think that just because 100% of the country did not improve the instant we intervened the Taliban is preferable then your moral compass is worryingly askew.

 
If you think the deaths and treasure spent there is justified for what we have, then I do not understand your reasoning.
 

Then read a book on Afghan history. You will soon see why I hold the position I do.

With respect, you don't know what you're talking about.

For starters, the war wasn't illegal. I went into a lot of detail, with my friend Folderol,  in this thread .

Secondly, the Iraq war was LESS than 2 weeks. We removed Saddam very promptly. Iraq had an Al Qaeda affiliate which became a the biggest component in the post-Saddam insurgency, fighting with Iraqi insurgents from the ruling Baath Party, former regime security forces, and other Iraqi Sunni Arabs. But most alarmingly, you accuse those deaths on USA/UK, but the reality is that this is ALL Saddam's fault. The time to co-operate on issues as important as WMDs was back when he received his "last warning" from the United Nations.

I have come across all the arguments so far, so by all means.  But only a few days ago, I made a post here making the case, rather briefly . I can't believe there are people, like you, who consider British lives more valuable than the millions of gassed Kurds, and other Iraqis being slaughtered without any reprieve. Utterly contemptible.

Then read a book on Afghan history. You will soon see why I hold the position I do.

 

You assume that because money has been spent on Afghanistan the lives of ordinary Afghans has improved. Some peoples have, but they are certainly not in the majority. In Kabul today you will see thousands of million dollar mansions not there previously, yet almost all the city lives in abject poverty(these stats are more than easy to find), inequality is much worse now. THe money spent falls in few people pockets, and they spend it on themselves (many western anyway) examples are easy to find try, almost every infasturce project so far. The work done is generally is no benefit to those living in rural areas (most of the country), due to the war zone, and any work that is done is means very little to the populous, if some one kills your relative (intentional or not) you will hardly care if they try to improve your infrastructure minimally.

Do you really think this sham election that occurred was worth any deaths (the Afghans don't)? You keep arrogantly telling me read your history, but ask your self why was there such great support for the Taliban just after the civil war (they ended it, when the west couldn't care less, even though they financed the destruction of the last government)? In their time under cruel martial law they brought about a state much "safer" than the current one, obviously not one that was good (I never said that), ordinary pashtoons in places like Hellmand, are starting to look back rose tintedly, compared to the violence they have now. Think if NATO was doing every ting so nicely, why is it they are losing more and more gound to the Taliban day by day, 5 years ago Lowgar, Wardak, Ghanzani etc were peaceful provinces now they are war zones, the people have risen up to support the Taliban, when you couldn't have force them to do so only a few years ago.. Do you think that might have something to do with the frustration and lack of progress of the people who live there?

The Afghan government is a complete joke, without western money and military support it would not last a week no solider would stay and fight for it if they were not payed, yet the Taliban don't have this problem. My argument is not that the Taliban are better than the current government (I hate the islamofascists as much as anyone), but NATO has not helped the current government properly and is not doing so effectively to make it worth staying, it made too many mistakes (invading Iraq and thinking Afghanistan was won come to mind), and leaving now would leave the country to the wolves restarting a civil war. Once NATO leave (unless it's after several decades) no one will think it was a good thing to invade, (even though it should have been). Americas actual intentions are beyond me.
 
 
 
To the extent to which it serves your self interest.

 

But you could argue that the Taliban do the same for their own self-interest. Peas in a pod the lot of you.
 
 
 
It saddens me that this thread gets a measly number of replies whilst a thread about Cheryl Coles hair gets 198+

Vauge sweeping statements are as easily brushed away as they are composed. Perhaps you can provide some of these examples that are so easy to find?

 
Do you really think this sham election that occurred was worth any deaths (the Afghans don't)? You keep arrogantly telling me read your history, but ask your self why was there such great support for the Taliban just after the civil war
 

Because the country was in abject chaos what has that to do with the here and now. You are becoming inconsistent.

 
In their time under cruel martial law they brought about a state much "safer" than the current one, obviously not one that was good (I never said that), ordinary pashtoons in places like Hellmand, are starting to look back rose tintedly, compared to the violence they have now.
 

Because the clerical dictatorship was majority pashtun. I doubt you will find many of Afghanistans other ethnic minorities looking back nostalgically to the time when they were raped, tortured and butchered into submission.

Does your argument really boil down to the dissent of the Pashtun population now that they are on the recieving end of Taliban bullets.

This is possibly one of the most terrible arguments in favour of non-intervention I have come across.

 
Think if NATO was doing every ting so nicely, why is it they are losing more and more gound to the Taliban day by day, 5 years ago Lowgar, Wardak, Ghanzani etc were peaceful provinces now they are war zones, the people have risen up to support the Taliban,
 

Do you have a source for the people rising up. I must have been reading something different about an insurgency of militant fanatics offering high wages.

There is a big difference between rising up in support and being forced out of desperation or fear to join.

The rest of your post is just drivel.

If you would like to actually make a small attempt at being more objective this is probably the most extensive survey carried out in Afghanistan. The last one was in 2008 this one is now. You will see that the situation is not perfect but it is also nowhere near as bad as you would like it to be.

Is this meant to be surprising?
 
 
 
But you could argue that the Taliban do the same for their own self-interest. Peas in a pod the lot of you.

 

Rational self interest.

The situation is pretty bad, do a bit more research or change what you think bad means.
Afghanistan is country incapable of defending it's self or paying it's way, without western money, which will eventually stop. Nato has lost the good will of the pasthoon people (due t many reasons), and soon others will follow.

If Obama's 2011 withdrawal date is kept to, the country is finished, if they stay and continue as they are things can only digress.
If you think the current government and "democracy" can do anything, then you are deluded. I don't want the situation to be this way, I wish the Afgahn government was strong and the Taliban nonexistant, but that is clearly not true, continuing this way will only continue the downward trend of security in afghanistan that has occurred these last 9 years.

yep - most likely explanation.
 
 
This is why we need to free Nelson Mandela.
 
 
 
You were already told that most civilians were killed by the Taliban and not by NATO forces.

And there's nothing illegal about this war so cut the crap.

At least we're not talking about millions any more...

Not really, the Taliban are just about as bad as they come. And the worse ones just heavn't been invaded yet, because the west can't be bothered with it.

When is the last time you've heard about a women being publicly executed without trial in Afghanistan?

Hasn't happened in years. Girls in Kabul go to school and get medical treatment, so a lot has changed.

 

You speak sense. Thank you.
 
 
 
So lets take this down to bare basics. Would you prefer the Taliban regime to still be in control of Afghanistan?

Would you prefer the Baathist regime to still be in control of Iraq?

 

Yes I do actually. Compare the bloodshed then and now... what have the taliban ever done to any of us? They were forced to help Binladen, yes. But they never ever hurt us in anyway what so ever.

Before you call them an evil regime, try looking at how Iran treats its people, or N.Korea. Why don't they get invaded? China is properly one of the most inhumane countries right now; see what they do the muslims living in china (western provinces of China)

Sadam and the Taliban didn't ever fire a bullet at us or our allies... and if it's because of what they do to their citizens, I think Countries like China, N.Korea, Iran and Syria should have much higher priorities while dealing with them. I'm not defending the Taliban, but I reckon our bullets should have been fired else where if anything. Remember, it was us and the AMericans who funded the Taliban/Saddam when they were at war with Iran/Russia, it is with our weapons they used to do injustice to their people.

We go where the money is. Fact

So let me get this straight. I link you to one of the most recent and widespread surveys of the Afghan people in 2010 carried out by an organisation respected for its impartiality, and you completely ignore it (probably didn't even glance at it) and link me to a series of articles concerning isolated incidents that back up your position. Despite the general and widespread nature of our debate?

That survey was a method by which we could have had a rational and reasonable debate, it being a fact that it backs up aspects of both my position and yours. Evidently you are not capable of intellectual discussion so I think I will end this here.
 
 
 
Yes I do actually. Compare the bloodshed then and now.

 

You evidently know nothing about Afghan history given the fact that the majority of the Taliban rule was spent pursuing ethnic genocide and civil war.

..
 
what have the taliban ever done to any of us? They were forced to help Binladen, yes. But they never ever hurt us in anyway what so ever.
 

You are evidently restriced by distinctions of border race and ethnicity. I am not.

 
Before you call them an evil regime, try looking at how Iran treats its people, or N.Korea. Why don't they get invaded?
 

I support the removal of these regimes. What is your point?

 
Sadam and the Taliban didn't ever fire a bullet at us or our allies
 

Evidently your historical knowledge stops at 2001.   I would suggest you research the legalities of the invasion. The perhaps you could revise your position.

...
 
and if it's because of what they do to their citizens, I think Countries like China, N.Korea, Iran and Syria should have much higher priorities while dealing with them.
 

Unfortunately two fo those countries are impossible to intevene. But I am glad you support intervention in Iran and Syria before those regimes acquire such weapons.

 
I'm not defending the Taliban, but I reckon our bullets should have been fired else where if anything.
 

So you are defending the Taliban.

 
Remember, it was us and the AMericans who funded the Taliban when they were at war with Iran/Russia,
 

The Taliban were never at war with Russia. They came into being around 1993/94. The Soviet Union had collapsed by then.

Thanks for saving me the effort by making a public display of your ignorance.
 
 
 
You clearly know absolutely nothing whatsoever about the Taliban and Baathist regimes because all of that happened and more.

Educate yourself before making innane and unlettered posts on a forum that has seen it all before.

First of all however I would like you to validate your claim that millions have died. As far as I am aware the conservative estimate is around 130,000 and the majority of those deaths were caused by insurgents, after all the biggest killers of the local population in Iraq and Afghanistan are not the armies of the 'west'.

Then I would like you to provide me with evidence that none of the above atrocities occured enmasse under Saddam or the Taliban.

You clearly have no substantial texts on the topic so I suggest you wikipedia/google Saddam's 'rape rooms' and secret police, the mass graves that continued to be exhumed each day, the genocide of Iraqi Kurds namely the massacre at Halabja but also the vicious campaign that swept Iraqi Kurdistan of hundreds and thousands. Perhaps you should also google the mass opression of the Iraqi Shiite population. The links from these topics alone will keep you reading for hours.

As for the Taliban perhaps you can start with something simple like their campaign against the education of women which included the slaughter of those who even attempted to read a book. Then the campaign on music and non-beard wearing men. Then you could move on to the attempted genocide by the Taliban against Afghanistans ethnic Hazara population and the violent repression of all other ethnic minorities. The mass sexual abuse by Taliban officials of young dancing boys and the slaughter of children born to political enemies.

I could go on and on and on you clearly cannot so get reading or just shut up.

You will quickly discover that in actually studying this topic your arguments will be utterly obliterated.

 

All the books you have read that have contributed to your conclusion are biased.
 
 
That guy is a terrible soldier.

What makes him think his morals matter during wartime?
 
 
 
LOOL!!! I honestly laughed when I read this... I don't think this is a proper place for a 12 year old kid, so go back to your CoD match on your Xbox360.

 

The only one acting childish is yourself, since you are resorting to insults without addressing the point raised.

The fact that you attempt to justify the rule of the Taliban by claiming that there others worse than the Taliban is not a defense.

A lawyer does not defend a murderer by claiming that there are serial killers worse than his client.

Yeah theres so much corruption in the Armed Forces.

Im still waiting for an answer to my question.

When did the taliban attack us? how did they hurt us?

Your analogy is rubbish; in the case of a rapist/murderer there should be a victim who asked for support... when did the people of Afghanistan ask us to invade them?

In this case it is better if one says this:

It is like seeing a few victims getting tortured before us, and we only help one because.... why? Syrians and Iranians are getting absolutely destroyed day by day. Syrians and Iranian regimes are so low, someone needs to step in ASAP. Syria and Iran actually do have the means to hurt us, they have proper organised armies with Air forces and huge tank fleets... Saddam cooperated fully and said there were no WMDs and actual inspectors backed this up, yet we invaded the Iraqis while the Iranians next door hang homosexuals.
 
 
 
Of course the Taliban did nothing wrong during their regime. That is unless you were a woman but we all know women aren't humans, right?  

 

This cant be the only reason we invaded them... Iranian and Syrian governments do worse than that

No they don't.

Women under the Taliban were banned from going to school or getting medical attention.

They were basically banned from setting their foot outside of their homes.

Iran and Syria have not yet sank to that level.
 
 
Ofcourse you are the terrorists. You have occupied Muslim countries and supplied Jews with weapons to kill Muslims. Weren't you expecting to get something back in return?
 
 
 
Im still waiting for an answer to my question.

When did the taliban attack us? how did they hurt us?

 

I didn't justify the invasion, so I am not sure why you are asking me those questions.

In fact, read my previous posts and I have continually questioned the motives of those that entered Afganistan and Iraq.

However, unlike you, I attempted to have a discussion rather than engage in insults.

 
Your analogy is rubbish; in the case of a rapist/murderer there should be a victim who asked for support... when did the people of Afghanistan ask us to invade them?

 

The wants of the Afghan people have nothing to do with my analogy.

Also a murder wouldn't have a victim that asked for support since the victim is dead. However, that really has little to do with the point I made regarding your defense.

 
In this case it is better if one says this:

It is like seeing a few victims getting tortured before us, and we only help one because.... why? Syrians and Iranians are getting absolutely destroyed day by day.

Saddam cooperated fully and said there were no WMDs and actual inspectors backed this up, yet we invaded the Iraqis while the Iranians next door hang homosexuals.

 

Again, my analogy was to point out that this has nothing to do with Afghanistan. The fact that you have repeated this, shows you failed to to understand what I said.

The argument that the Iranians are worse than the Taliban does not negate the moral argument put forward for the invasion of Afghanistan.
 
 
 
You said my knowledge of history stopped at 2001... what did the taliban do to us then? Still waiting for a reason why the taliban were taken out of power when there are more serious criminals sitting on thrones (Think Syria/Iran)

 

Okay I have repeated myself twice now and you still cannot comprehend what I am saying. So here it is in bulletpoints.

Unlike you I do not make distinctions based upon race or the borders within which an individual may reside. This means that I contend the notion of 'us'. As far as I am concerned 'us' is the entire human race. I have already told you that I support intervention in these particular countries and others. Unfortunately realpolitik dictates what can actually occur in present reality. That does not mean however that I will not support an oppurtunity for intevention when it arises. I am perplexed as why you continue to press the issue.

Because I keep repeating my question and no one has answered yet.

What has the Taliban done to harm the interest of the British/American public. We went to war to make the UK and the USA safer, no?

I understand your point about us=human... But this isn't how it is seen in the eyes of our leaders and ministers.

I don't care about our leaders or our ministers and that was not my argument. But I will humour you.

If you actually look into the legalities of the Iraq war it was justified on the basis of UN Resolution 867 concerning the ceasefire that came into effect after the first gulf war, you should have a read of it yourself if you want complexities but the possession of chemical weapons by Saddam Hussein violated the resolution inviting a resumption of hostilities. (It was not a declaration of war.)

As for Afghanistan there area whole myriad of reasons that a western statesman could use to justify the invasion. Firstly is the obvious harbouring of Al Qaeda. This did not suddenly start in 2001 the US had demanded the Taliban surrender Bin Laden after a spate of deadly embassy bombings and dammning evidence. Despite this evidence the Taliban refused to surrender Bin Laden and granted him land to establish terrorist training camps. Basically Al Qaeda became a state supported operation.

This of course would explain why on the morning of the 9/11 attacks Al Qaeda vacated their bases in-country for the mountains and the Taliban began forifying their defensive positions. Of course there is nothing suspicious about that is there?

The argument that 'there are worse regimes' is simply ridiculous and the logic flawed as pointed out by other users in this thread.

But like I said, the above is not the base angle I take on the conflict.

America hasn't pursued a policy of civilian victimization in either Iraq or Afghanistan.

Who gives a ****. Most of these dictators don't say, "we are going to pursue evil" no, they are pursuing things "for the benefit of their country, it's just a shame people get in their way". America says the exact same things.

The current Iraqi civilian body count is between 98,000 to 107,000 Thats alot of ****ing civilians, the USA has done a better job than Osama Bin Laden could have ever dreamed of.

So you are blaming the fact that the enemies of the US have killed 90,000+ civilians, actually let's say that the US has killed up to 10,000 iraqi civilians, on the US??

Weak argument.

those 90,000 would not have died if America wasn't there, and it is much less then 90,000 and much more than 10,000.

10,000 civilians, let's see, in American language, that would be more than 3 9/11s.

1) 9/11 was intentional. The US has intentionally killed much fewer civilians in Iraq than 10,000.

2) Saddam killed as many as 200,000 from just personal interrogations - ie not including his Kurdish massacres. In Halabja Saddam might of killed as many Iraqis as the US has killed since 2003, in one day.

Are you going back on your figures, when you really should be going up? America is responsible for the deaths in its country it is occupying. Like I said 90,000+ they entered that mess, they're responsible for the disunity.

 
Saddam killed as many as 200,000 from just personal interrogations - ie not including his Kurdish massacres. In Halabja Saddam might of killed as many Iraqis as the US has killed since 2003, in one day.
 

So it's okay to kill 10,000 innocent (TBH 98-100k) in order to remove Saddam?

1) You are blaming US forces on the deaths of civilians they didn't even kill.

What do you mean when you say that? "Oh sorry about that, didn't mean to kill you there". It's just as wrong, it's like you're trying to brush it off. Those people have lives, they have families as well, they had loved ones in tears too.
 
 
 
Of course, they were the trigger, they created the situation for it.

 

Well, the fact that Iraq broke resolution 687 of the ceasefire means that Iraq was at fault for the resumption of hostilities after the 1st Gulf War.

 
What do you mean when you say that? "Oh sorry about that, didn't mean to kill you there". It's just as wrong, it's like you're trying to brush it off. Those people have lives, they have families as well, they had loved ones in tears too.

 

Motive is a massive deal. If you do not recognize motive then you are just a fail. There is a reason why the courts discriminate between 1st degree murder, 2nd degree murder and MANSLAUGHTER. Some forms of killing have to be legal in war, otherwise laws would never be adhered to in war.
 
 
 
Of course, they were the trigger, they created the situation for it.

This is the most contemptible argument I have ever heard. I suppose you think of the Iraqi people as mere animals who couldn't possibly handle the concept of responsibility and self awareness?

After all they are just poor little brown people with no sense of right and wrong. Unless they have a powerful tyrant keeping them in their pens they will run amok and blow up supermarkets of innocent civilians screaming for the injustice doled out to their shepard.

How about you get some perspective and a bit of clarity?

yes, it's still murder though. There is no such thing as legal killing of the innocent. Even if there was, it's legal according to the one carrying out the action, not to the one receiving it. i.e. it's legal in your eyes, it's definitely not legal in the small child who has about to get hit by a cruise missile.

I don't know how you came to that conclusion. The situation in Iraq was incredibly complex before the Americans entered it, there has always been tension between the shiites and the sunnis. The Americans completely destabilized the situation, they had no consideration as to where the tensions were within Iraqi society.

The sunnis and shiites have different perspectives on Islam and each sees its own version of Islam as correct, there have always been major disagreements between the sects, especially in Iraq where Shiites have identified several major holy sites which they feel belong to them.

I don't think you realized what i was talking about...are you sure thats not what you think of them?

So according to you stable is a country with millions buried in mass graves and an absolute tyrant who pursues genocide against two ethnic minorities and a brutal repression of a religious population?

Well, your moral compass is certainly an interesting one.

That has absolutely nothing to do with anything.

 
I don't think you realized what i was talking about...are you sure thats not what you think of them?
 

Wow, great counter-argument. By essentially blaming the US for the actions of an extremely small minority of fundamentalist barbarians you are essentially absolving said barbarians of any responsibility. Those same men were previously employed butchering the Kurds and Shiites before the US came in and destroyed Saddam's regime.

Once again your moral inclinations astound me.
 
 
 
yes, it's still murder though. There is no such thing as legal killing of the innocent. Even if there was, it's legal according to the one carrying out the action, not to the one receiving it. i.e. it's legal in your eyes, it's definitely not legal in the small child who has about to get hit by a cruise missile.

 

Congratulations you have discovered that law is subjective and not bestowed upon man from the universal heavens.

Soon you may realise that human life is simply not feasible without such base values. (Perhaps read some Nietzsche?)

Your argument is simply worthless.
 
 
 
I blame it on Dragovich, Kravchenko and Steiner.

Where's Mason when we need him??

 

all must die.  
 
 
The issue is that you are all coming from a Western perspective

and in the West you believe that democracy is the bestest invention in the whole wide world.

 
So according to you stable is a country with millions buried in mass graves and an absolute tyrant who pursues genocide against two ethnic minorities and a brutal repression of a religious population?
 

There is far less stability now then there was under Saddam before the Americans invaded. Of course Saddam commited those crimes and needed to be on trial, but the country has gone to **** now.

The problem is the US stepped into it thinking it knew all about it. All it did was exchange one mess for another mess. It has no idea of the further destabilization of the country its going to cause.

In other words what the hell is the US doing in other peoples business? It has to, because it has to feed its fat population the a quarter of the worlds oil supply. The US government doesn't give a damn about Iraqis or Saddamn, it's only interested in one thing, a guaranteed supply of oil, hence one of the reasons why America provided Iran and Iraq with weapons to kill each other with during the Iran Iraq war.

Do not believe that the situation is now better in Iraq now, everyone knows it isn't neither nor is Pakistan, Afghanistan only has potential at the moment.

As a Pakistani I believe that democracy works great in America but, trust me, it doesn't work in this region. Pakistan needed musharraf to maintain order, right now the Pakistani people are calling for martial law, Zadari got in through democracy, why? because the Americans like that and when the Americans like it they back it, not knowing of course that he is a crook.

Democracy is funny in the middle east, because in the end, the democratic government essentially turn into a dictatorship. Egypt is great because the leaders cheat in the election. The US would be screwed if they didn't, why? Because right now the Islamic brotherhood are getting the majority of the people on their side, the IB are an extremist right group who essentially are the taleban of Egypt. If they came to power then there would be no democracy any longer and the US would have a giant opposing force to deal with.

I am steering away from Iraq because I want to show you how you will never really understand what its like here and why exporting democracy leads to chaos in the middle east.

Afghanistan is a British invention created in 1880. Pakistanis recognize the Pashtuns and have always been in favor of the Pashtuns and ensuring that the Pashtuns are dominant over the Hazaras. The Pashtuns are sunni whilst the Hazaras are shiite. This is what Pakistan perceives in the region of Afghanistan. What do the American's perceive? Pakistanis, Afghanistanis and Taleban, assuming that its as simple as removing the taleban and thus creating peace. This is what's going to happen if the Taleban are eliminated in Afghanistan, the Pashtuns and the Hazaras will go back to fighting each other within the region and civil war will break out amongst the tribes just as it did after the Russians left.

On a map Baluchistan appears to be a state in Pakistan. It isn't a state in Pakistan, the government do not rule in Baluchistan and no Pakistani law is applied in Baluchistan, no one really goes there simply because it is ruled by tribes and war lords. Why? Because the war lords out gun the Pakistani government in that region.

In Pakistan, whoever has the most money and guns on the street controls that street and the law on that street, the police commit almost as much crime as the actual criminals do so there is no trusting the police. The government are only in power because they have the most guns.

In America you believe that a government is there for you, like its a kind of body that holds the country together. Here a government is a body or person who has the most power and strength to enforce their laws. There are no borderlines, there are just tribal lands.

Saudi Arabia is the only country in the world named after a person. Abdul-Aziz ibn Saud, Saudi Arabia is a land run by a tribe, if a stronger tribe rises and kills the current ruling tribe then that tribe gets Saudi, however, i doubt it will happen as the current ruling tribe is backed by the US.

My dad was talking to one of the old tribe leaders in Dubai, the current leader of UAE was blamed for the crises. this old tribe leader told my dad that back in the day they would have chopped the guys head off and taken to the throne, but it was not possible now that the UAE has western backing.

Now before you all say i am going off topic. These situations are incredibly complex simply because the western idea of government is not the middle eastern idea of government. When you put US military action into the mix, deep seeds are usually left, when the strong man with the majority of guns is removed as leader of the street, the street descends into chaos.

Let me give you a metaphor of Iraq with a real life experience ; there is a neighborhood in Karachi, which about 10 years ago had gunfire going off every night, there was a curfew because it was so bad. However, along came one guy a rich guy who managed to gain influence in the area, after a while this guy managed to have his own gang as it were, this gang placed its own laws on the area and appeased all the violence that was occurring amongst the small gangs. The street is now safe to live on, its run by this one guy, whatever that guy says goes, he definatly doesn't follow the rules, slightly unethical, maybe a mobster but the street is safe and the majority are generally able to live their lives. This is not democracy

Along comes the US citing that this is not a democracy, they remove the dictator, what do you think will happen?...chaos reigns.

And that is a small peak into the middle east, my intention is to hopefully get you to see that the situation here is complex and when you put your hand into it, you just move the muck, you don't get rid of it.
 
 
 
You clearly know absolutely nothing whatsoever about the Taliban and Baathist regimes because all of that happened and more.

Educate yourself before making innane and unlettered posts on a forum that has seen it all before.

First of all however I would like you to validate your claim that millions have died. As far as I am aware the conservative estimate is around 130,000 and the majority of those deaths were caused by insurgents, after all the biggest killers of the local population in Iraq and Afghanistan are not the armies of the 'west'.

Then I would like you to provide me with evidence that none of the above atrocities occured enmasse under Saddam or the Taliban.

You clearly have no substantial texts on the topic so I suggest you wikipedia/google Saddam's 'rape rooms' and secret police, the mass graves that continued to be exhumed each day, the genocide of Iraqi Kurds namely the massacre at Halabja but also the vicious campaign that swept Iraqi Kurdistan of hundreds and thousands. Perhaps you should also google the mass opression of the Iraqi Shiite population. The links from these topics alone will keep you reading for hours.

As for the Taliban perhaps you can start with something simple like their campaign against the education of women which included the slaughter of those who even attempted to read a book. Then the campaign on music and non-beard wearing men. Then you could move on to the attempted genocide by the Taliban against Afghanistans ethnic Hazara population and the violent repression of all other ethnic minorities. The mass sexual abuse by Taliban officials of young dancing boys and the slaughter of children born to political enemies.

I could go on and on and on you clearly cannot so get reading or just shut up.

You will quickly discover that in actually studying this topic your arguments will be utterly obliterated.

 

Your right, it's not the armies of the West. It's the goverments of the West!

You talk about Saddam Hussain's regime as if the history of his regime started when the West decided that it wanted to invade Iraq. You talk about his atrocities but fail to see who brought Saddam Hussain into power & who kept him in power.

You talk about reading? Read this:

"Having crowned a puppet Iraqi king, Faisal, the British set about destroying the independence movement by pulverising villages with artillery and bombing farmlands with phosphorus bombs and metal crowsfeet designed to maim livestock. Iraq, source of the world's highest-grade oil, remained a British colony in all but name until the Suez invasion in 1956.

Two years later, the Iraqi monarchy was overthrown by a nationalist, Abd al-Karim Kassem, who himself fell victim to an internecine struggle. The new regime called itself an " Arab socialist union," and a measure of plurality included a decentralised administration and recognition of the Kurdish language and national identity. When the Iraq Petroleum Company, the foreign consortium that exploited Iraq's oil, was threatened with nationalisation in 1963, the new imperial power, the United States, engineered what the Central Intelligence Agency called its "favourite coup." "We regarded it as a great victory," said James Critchfield, then head of the CIA in the Middle East. [44] The Secretary-General of the Ba'ath Party, Ali Saleh Sa'adi, concurred. "We came to power on a CIA train," he said, thereafter instigating a reign of terror that produced Saddam Hussein, who became the top man in 1979. He was America's man. "Saddam has a great deal to thank the CIA for," Said Aburish, his biographer, told me. "He can thank them for bringing the Ba'ath Party to power, for helping him personally, for providing him with financial aid during the war with Iran, for protecting him against internal coups d'etat. It's a continuing relationship from the early 1960s until now, and it's a love/hate relationship." [45]

Excerpt from 'The New Rulers of The World' by John Pilger (p.65)

Do I really need to provide a commentary for the above? I believe it speaks volumes already.

It goes on to talk about America's gratitude for Iraq for protecting its clients Arab states from Iran's revolutionary virus.

Read this:

"When John Kelly, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State, visited Baghdad in 1989, he told him: "you are a force for moderation in the region, and the United States wants to broaden her relationship with Iraq." [46] The "force for moderation" had just claimed victory in a war against Iran, which resulted in more than a million casualties on both sides, dead and wounded. When human rights groups presented evidence that Saddam Hussein had used mustard gas and nerve gas against Iranian soldiers and Kurdish civilians, the State Department refused to condemn him. [47] As Saddam Hussein was preparing his forces for the attack on his southern neighbour, a U.S. Department of Energy official discovered that advanced nuclear reactors were being shipped to Iraq. When he alerted his superiors, he was moved to another job. "We knew about their bomb programme," said a former member of the Bush administration, "but Saddam was our ally... " [48]

Also, the army may not have killed as many as some say (is any number of civilian deaths acceptable, within an already illegal war?) but the economic sanctions imposed on Iraq before the war (yes, that's right, before) has surely killed up to half a million children.

Read this:

"In 1999, seventy members of the U.S. Congress signed an unusually blunt letter to President Clinton, appealing to him to lift the embargo and end what they called "infanticide masquerading as policy." [40] The Clinton administration had already given them their reply. In 1996, in an infamous interview on the American current affairs programme 60 Minutes, Madeleine Albright, then U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, had been asked: "We have heard that half a million children have died... is the price worth it?" Albright replied, "I think it is a very hard choice, but the price—we think the price it worth it." [41]

Excerpt from The New Rulers of The World by John Pilger (p.60-1)

To be honest I could go on and on aswell. I have references to the atrocities that you metioned and references to the US allowing Saddam to get away with these atrocoties. And people wonder why Saddam was allowed to get away with it. Well, the fear was that the Kurds might establish their own state and that the Shi'a might forge an 'Islamic alliance' with Iran.

Read this (no more after this I promise!):

"Perhaps the most repulsive thing about the whole policy," wrote Eric Herring, "is that U.S. and British decision-makers have exploited popular humanitarian sentiment for the most cynical realpolitik reasons. They have no desire for the Shi'ite majority to take control or for the Kurds to gain independence. Their policy is to keep them strong enough to cause trouble for Saddam Hussein while ensuring that Saddam Hussein is strong enough to keep repressing them. This is a direct descendant of British imperial policy from the First World War onwards [and is about the control] of Iraqi oil... Divide and Rule was and is the policy." [78]

Excerpt from The New Rulers of The World by John Pilger (p.81)

And if the justification for going into Iraq is using UN Security Resolutions 687, for example, which says that Iraqi disarmament should be a step 'towards the goal of establishing in the Middle East a zone free from weapons of mass destruction...' Then why has Israel not been subjected to such scrutiny, whereas Iraq has? Must be - Occupation + Vast natural resources = Profit making.

Or if the justification is due to morality then why do regimes which tend to benefit those poorest in a country often get replaced by so called 'democracies' which tend to make the rich richer and the poor poorer? (Indonesia anyone?) Why is it that the natural resources are owned by foreign companies? And why is it, that if a resource was to get nationalised (refer to first excerpt above) then the goverment in power is not in power for very long? Where is the morality in exploiting a countries natural resource? Where is the morality in allowing foreign companies to exploit your countries greatest source of wealth and not giving back to those who need the help (Indonesia again anyone?). Why are contries like like these (which have people working in up to 40 degrees Centigrade and for 36 hours) not subjugated using the same morale compass? This maybe due to the fact that within these countries are Western owned companies. So I suppose there is no such thing as morality when your getting rich.

Your right, it's not the armies of the West. It's the goverments of the West!

 

Excellent analysis  

 
You talk about Saddam Hussain's regime as if the history of his regime started when the West decided that it wanted to invade Iraq. You talk about his atrocities but fail to see who brought Saddam Hussain into power & who kept him in power.
 

Actually no you are completely mistaken. Scroll up a few posts to Lord Hysteria's response and see this particular argument completely debunked.

Even so, if you were correct and a previous generation did install a tyrant (As it has done many times before) Surely that would double our responsibility to remove him?

By preaching non-intervention you are as much an imperialist as anybody else because you wish to carry on the imperialist policies of the cold war and keep those tyrants in power, in effect you wish to fuly support and maintain the status quo. How more conservative can you get?

You talk about reading? Read this:

Excerpt was largely irellevent. Copy and pasting articles from anti-war websites without your own analysis results in an absolutely worthless discussion.

Please explain how the involvement of a previous generation of US officials in aiding Saddam during the Iran/Iraq war should prevent us from liberating the Iraqi people a few decades later.

Until you adress this the entirety of your post is worthless.  

 
And if the justification for going into Iraq is using UN Security Resolutions 687, for example, which says that Iraqi disarmament should be a step 'towards the goal of establishing in the Middle East a zone free from weapons of mass destruction...' Then why has Israel not been subjected to such scrutiny, whereas Iraq has? Must be - Occupation + Vast natural resources = Profit making.
 

An utter fallacy. If it was about vast natural resources then why did America not do what it always does? In fact what every imperial power has done since the dawn of civlisation: Eliminate the present dictator and install another puppet?

This could be done for an absolute fraction of the cost and lives already spent. It happened in Iran, it happened in latin America it happened all over the world during the era of cold war imperialism.

Tell me if it was about securing resources, stability and profit. Why would the US spend trillions of dollars, thousands of lives and acres of international reputation on establishing a democracy; one of the most unstable forms of government that exists for a great power securing a hegemony.

Once again your arguments are worthless. So is the time you spent searching the internet for the writing of other equally flawed arguments to copy and paste. Think how much time you could have saved without that insecure appeal to authority.  

 
Or if the justification is due to morality then why do regimes which tend to benefit those poorest in a country often get replaced by so called 'democracies' which tend to make the rich richer and the poor poorer? (Indonesia anyone?) Why is it that the natural resources are owned by foreign companies?
 

Oh please, all companies are practically foreign now. Hence the term multinational. What a weak attempt at an argument.

 
And why is it, that if a resource was to get nationalised (refer to first excerpt above) then the goverment in power is not in power for very long?
 

You are comparing events five decades ago to events now. Until you validate this link the comparisons are utterly worthless.
 
 
 
The issue is that you are all coming from a Western perspective

and in the West you believe that democracy is the bestest invention in the whole wide world.

 

Oh my gosh you have discovered that morality is also entirely subjective!

 
There is far less stability now then there was under Saddam before the Americans invaded. Of course Saddam commited those crimes and needed to be on trial, but the country has gone to **** now.
 

There is far less stability under David Cameron than there is under Kim Jong Il. If we judged things on stability alone then we would all advocate a reality akin to some Orwellian wonderland.

Is that really what you base your idea of justice on?

 
In other words what the hell is the US doing in other peoples business? It has to, because it has to feed its fat population the a quarter of the worlds oil supply. The US government doesn't give a damn about Iraqis or Saddamn, it's only interested in one thing, a guaranteed supply of oil, hence one of the reasons why America provided Iran and Iraq with weapons to kill each other with during the Iran Iraq war.
 

Then why didn't they do what they have always done and what every imperial power has done since the dawn of civilisation. Why didn't they eliminate Saddam and install a friendly puppet who would have no problem supplying the oil.

Human history utterly obliterates this argument. It explodes it into a millions pieces. Why spend trillions of dollars, thousands of lives and an international reputation to establish a democracy?

Let me guess....Bush is stoopid?  

  This argument has become so utterly generic I have refuted it so many times.  

Why did Tony Blair intervene in Sierra Leonne? Why did he support the continued intervention in Kosovo?

You know it is people like you who are at fault for the rape and slaughter of 40,000 Bosniak Muslims in the early nineties. because while these women and children were butchered under the watching eye of NATO sattelites, the powers that mattered debated over whether it was their business to intervene, over whether they had the right.

 
Do not believe that the situation is now better in Iraq now, everyone knows it isn't neither nor is Pakistan, Afghanistan only has potential at the moment.
 

Better is entirely subjective. no doubt you would think the situation was better if everyone was locked into labour camps with numbers instead of names. After all you seem to define 'better' with regards to stability.

Otherwise known as totalitarianism.

 
As a Pakistani I believe that democracy works great in America but, trust me, it doesn't work in this region. Pakistan needed musharraf to maintain order, right now the Pakistani people are calling for martial law, Zadari got in through democracy, why? because the Americans like that and when the Americans like it they back it, not knowing of course that he is a crook.
 

Oh please Pakistan is rotten to its very core. Democracy in that country is an utter farce. Yet you state it will not work out there without explaining why. I am really starting to believe you see your fellow countrymen and the hundreds of other millions of individuals in that region as mindless animals who cannot handle the concept of democratic responsibility.

Yet when one strips away the rhetoric of apologists like yourself we see it is not the people who are revolting, it is not the people who are blowing themselves up and killing the soldiers who remove the tyrants. It is the infinitesimal minority of thugs and gangsters, many leftovers from the Baathist regime who still believe that they can establish their caliphate on the backs of all the innocent people who wnat nothing but their own lives and safety.

It is not the people who reject this and never forget that.

 
I am steering away from Iraq because I want to show you how you will never really understand what its like here and why exporting democracy leads to chaos in the middle east.
 

Oh pelase racism now? You think just because you are from Pakistan you know more about the region than me. As a history student that region and the conflicts of the last century have beenan obsession for me for over two years. Just because you have brown skin doesn't mean you have some kind of inherent knowledge you contemptible little bigot.

 
Afghanistan is a British invention created in 1880. Pakistanis recognize the Pashtuns and have always been in favor of the Pashtuns and ensuring that the Pashtuns are dominant over the Hazaras. The Pashtuns are sunni whilst the Hazaras are shiite. This is what Pakistan perceives in the region of Afghanistan. What do the American's perceive? Pakistanis, Afghanistanis and Taleban, assuming that its as simple as removing the taleban and thus creating peace. This is what's going to happen if the Taleban are eliminated in Afghanistan, the Pashtuns and the Hazaras will go back to fighting each other within the region and civil war will break out amongst the tribes just as it did after the Russians left.
 

Once again you betray your belief that these people are mindless animal barabrians who cannot think about modern concepts. They can only fight each other like beasts in the wild fighting over territory. What a despicable person you are.

 
On a map Baluchistan appears to be a state in Pakistan. It isn't a state in Pakistan, the government do not rule in Baluchistan and no Pakistani law is applied in Baluchistan, no one really goes there simply because it is ruled by tribes and war lords. Why? Because the war lords out gun the Pakistani government in that region.
 

What does this have to do with anything! I know all this and it is completely irellevent to our discussion. Evidently you realise you ahve been utterly defeated in debate over Iraq and are now retreating into your narrow and flawed idea of Pakistani history in an effort to save some face.

What an utter waste of my time you have been.  
 
 
 
It saddens me that this thread gets a measly number of replies whilst a thread about Cheryl Coles hair gets 198+

 

Definitely Agree with this.
 
 
 
There is far less stability under David Cameron than there is under Kim Jong Il. If we judged things on stability alone then we would all advocate a reality akin to some Orwellian wonderland.

Is that really what you base your idea of justice on?
 

Stability: economy, security, employment, international relations

 
Then why didn't they do what they have always done and what every imperial power has done since the dawn of civilisation. Why didn't they eliminate Saddam and install a friendly puppet who would have no problem supplying the oil.
 

Before the Americans invaded the oil fields were owned by Russian French and other countries, since the war those major players left and now Halliburton and other American companies have dominated the oil fields.

They have installed a friendly puppet.

 
Human history utterly obliterates this argument. It explodes it into a millions pieces. Why spend trillions of dollars, thousands of lives and an international reputation to establish a democracy
 

Democracy means the American way. As in when they install democracy, they are actually breaking down the current system to install their own way of doing things.

This:

 
You know it is people like you who are at fault for the rape and slaughter of 40,000 Bosniak Muslims in the early nineties. because while these women and children were butchered under the watching eye of NATO sattelites, the powers that mattered debated over whether it was their business to intervene, over whether they had the right.

Evidently you realise you ahve been utterly defeated in debate over Iraq and are now retreating into your narrow and flawed idea of Pakistani history in an effort to save some face.
 

is you not being able to refute any of my claims.

I am interested in your intelligence not your emotions.

 
Why did he support the continued intervention in Kosovo?
 

Simple if the anti-american serbians took hold, key oil deposits would have been cut from western access.

It's only in America's interest if it risks increasing the price of happy meals.

 
Oh pelase racism now? You think just because you are from Pakistan you know more about the region than me.
 

Are you going to tell me that you know more about it than me....?

 
Yet you state it will not work out there without explaining why. I am really starting to believe you see your fellow countrymen and the hundreds of other millions of individuals in that region as mindless animals who cannot handle the concept of democratic responsibility.
 

I am not saying that it will not work, I am saying it has not worked. Pakistan is the best democracy in the middle east, it seems like the most honest at the moment, if you can spot a better example let me know.

No that's what you see us as, you see this way of life as "mindless animals who cannot handle the concept of democratic responsibility". Right now it is tribal warfare, who ever has the most guns and biggest tribes rules. That's how its been for the last hundred years, perhaps the last thousand years. There is nothing wrong with the way it is, people are interested in a leader who can provide, people will work for a lord who can dictate. Islam dictates the One god, Muhammad(pbuh) was not democratic, that does not mean he was evil.

It is so deeply ingrained in the western psyche that if it is not democracy it is evil, rather than, if the ruler is of good character and is one with god than he knows well to rule. Please don't refer to the people who follow this way of life as "mindless animals". Democracy is your invention, you keep it, we have our way.
 
 
 
...

 

even though I disagree with your views, i like the fact that you have looked at history and studied the middle east with such detail, so kudos for that.

I'm interested as to what you think of Robert Fisk's view on Afghanistan: that the Afghan mentality is different to the west's in terms of their attitudes with democracy and role of women, he proposes that instead of military intervention, we should let them learn for themselves how to run their society fairly, because military intervention will never change their mentality.

That's sort of patronizing isn't it, suggesting that Afghans don't know how to rule themselves after all these years.

no, not at all. maybe the way they rule themselves now is the way they prefer? i don't know much about Afghanistan, hence why i am quoting Fisk.

I utterly disagree. the 'Afghan mentality' is an entirely fallacious concept bearing in mind that Afghanistan is composed of numerous different ethnicities and cultures.

What I would think he is talking about are fundamentalist Islamic values which are a very recent phenomena traceable to the latter half of this century when the extremist sects of the Pakistani military, notably the ISI sought to infiltrate and unite the Pashtun tribal lands to secure trade routes and a hegemony. I think the short term nature of this mentality entirely undermines any alternative action based upon it.

The most wide-ranging and in depth surveys conducted in post-Taliban Afghanistan by the Asia institute found that as far back as 2006 there was over 70% of Afghans who looked favourably both on Democracy and certain equal political rights for women. Together with over 90% being opposed to what the Taliban stood for. Though these numbers dipped during 07/08 they began to rise again last year and have remained on the whole fairly consistent.

I think dismissing the Afghans as being of a certain type of mentality is entirely irrational and perhaps an attempt at an easy way out. After all if we left them to it as Fisk puts it, we would not be leaving the Afghan people to develop their own kind of democracy. We would be leaving them defenceless in the face of battle-hardened insurgency who wish to impose a 7th century absolutism on the people. Anybody who would even utter the word democracy would be butchered.
 
 
 
Stability: economy, security, employment, international relations

 

Wow..... perhaps you should read up on your recent Iraq history. Please tell me exactly how Saddam's economic and internal security was stable.  

He did not have control of the northern part of his country and was fighting a civil war against Kurdish factions. He was also fighting against domestic and foregin Shiite interests. The country was on economic lockdown with western sanctions and employment was astronomical. You will find these facts validated in all good history books. I suggest you start with one that has a lot of colourful pictures in it.

 
Before the Americans invaded the oil fields were owned by Russian French and other countries, since the war those major players left and now Halliburton and other American companies have dominated the oil fields.

They have installed a friendly puppet.
 

 

Nice one trying to dodge the question. So I will ask you again. Why spend trillions of dollars, thousands of lives and an internatinoal reputation to establish a "friendly puppet" when they could spend an infinitesimal fraction of that cost eliminating Saddam and installing a friendly puppet.

Your argument utterly fails here. I am not even going to take apart your claim that there is currently a "friendly puppet" controlling Iraq.  

 
Democracy means the American way. As in when they install democracy, they are actually breaking down the current system to install their own way of doing things.
 

This makes no sense whatsoever. The current administration in Iraq is leaning towards the Islamic republic of Iran. The US has little to no control of the democratic government and if is in no position whatsoever to forcibly overthrow it because it would go directly against everything they have said they would do. In fact if they were to do such a thing the entire country would rise up against them rather than a small insurgency of fundamentalist barbarians.

You seriously have no idea what you are talking about. You are making claims with no eveidence, and as the famous mantra goes what can be asserted without evidence can be dismussed in the same way. Fortunately for you I am giving you the benefit of the doubt and replying, although I am having to fill in some pretty big blanks for you.

 
This:

is you not being able to refute any of my claims.

I am interested in your intelligence not your emotions.
 

No, this is me venting my frustration after refuting your claims because you do not seem to have any idea what you are talking about.

 
Simple if the anti-american serbians took hold, key oil deposits would have been cut from western access.
 

 

Right thats it I'm out. This is the most fatuous thing I have ever come across on this forum. And like I say above what can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed as such.

What a waste of my time. A debate with Diaz89 is more productive than this.

Democracy and Islam are incompatible. Islam operates under a theocracy and dictatorship it serves God not the people (which democracy does). But, I agree with your second statement. Regardless of what Islam states, if the Afghan population wants to be ruled by a democracy, they should be allowed to.

It's not necessarily Islam, its more to do with the way of life, further in the north there was less of the tribal way of life. I think it all came from the way people adapted to the environment, the desert is a cruel mistress, very few resources and many people trying to get their hands on it. I think that may have been the basis for the tribal psyche

i'll be back tomorrow for aeolous

peace out

i was always taught that the quran is silent on the issue of how to choose a leader, this was up to the people themselves.
when the prophet died, his companions chose who would be the caliph by giving allegiance to whom they wish to lead them. the person with the most number of votes was the leader - is this not the essence of democracy?
there are many islamic scholars that agree with democracy being compatible with Islam, of course it also depends on how the people wish to elect a leader.

Saddam was originally a puppet but he changed and you don't think they tried to kill him countless times? Saddam was issued with the job of assassinating the leader before him he knew all the tricks and could prevent himself being assassinated
 
 
America is the counter-terrorist, they're the good guys.

Your wording is hard to understand. When Mohamed died, the caliphates (the firsts one at least) were chosen by the shura. That isn't really democratic.

Not, really. The majority of traditional scholars are against it. And I base my opinion on what Islamic history (i.e. what system did the previous Islamic empires use). There are aspects of democracy that are compatible, however.

No, I am sorry but it isn't (from a traditionalist point of view), he does however make some points that fit Islamically with traditionalist.

lol since when do american lives matter the rich don't care about poor people also why else would they invade other than for oil?

wmds? ermm no North Korea has them they haven't been invaded

for ethical reasons? ermm no there are plenty of other brutal dictators around

  Obviously American cares about its citizens. It needs it citizens (according to the bull**** conspiracy theory you believe). Look at CIA history. If they really just wanted to kill Saadam, he would be dead. They wouldn't damage their economy, population and reputation.

Iraq also has them. Why haven't North Korea been invaded? Well a) they are a crazy bunch and b) they are a crazy bunch. They already have Nuclear weapons and it's relatively hard to take a nuclear weapons from a nuclear-weapon state.

Aeolus has already dealt with this before:

 
In fact i ask that question as often as i can. So i ask you now. Would you have supported the invasion of Rwanda and nation building? Or would you have opposed it because fifty years ago the administration which held power in the USA (Now all dead) Pursued and abhorrent foreign policy in Iran?

It's a relatively simple intervention which prevents another genocide in Europe.
Then why did it not happen sooner? Why were the adminstrations of the day using the same arguments you are using now. Should we have not tried to save the Bosnians from being raped and tortured because decades before the US administration of the day financed rape and torture?

Bush didn't invade Iraq on a humanitarian cause to wipe out totalitarianism what nonsense!
Then why did he wipe out totalitarianism and pursue a humanitarian agenda feeding the people and releasing political prisoners etc..?

But save them trillions?
 
 
 
So according to you stable is a country with millions buried in mass graves and an absolute tyrant who pursues genocide against two ethnic minorities and a brutal repression of a religious population?

Well, your moral compass is certainly an interesting one.

That has absolutely nothing to do with anything.

Wow, great counter-argument. By essentially blaming the US for the actions of an extremely small minority of fundamentalist barbarians you are essentially absolving said barbarians of any responsibility. Those same men were previously employed butchering the Kurds and Shiites before the US came in and destroyed Saddam's regime.

Once again your moral inclinations astound me.

 

So your idea of creating stability in the middle east is to bomb the **** out of some brown people, create a power vacuum destabilizing the entire region further, emboldening and strengthening an already hostile Iran and essentially forging a giant recruitment campaign for more "barbarians" to rally around? Way to go!

You do realise that this conflict has actually radicalized once moderate people? You're making massive sweeping generalizations about the motives of these 'terrorists'. If you came into my house uninvited and started ****ting all over my living room, I too would slap you so hard you wouldn't know what hit you. To tarnish them all with the same 'they're all barbarians' brush is to have no emotional empathy with some of these people at all. How would you feel if Americans bust into your home and took you away to Abu Ghraib, or your daughter was an unfortunate "mistake" of collateral damage? For all your talk and allusions to the moral high ground, justifying yet even more murder would ironically lead me to question your own 'moral compass'.

Just a question, at what point does the number of human being's deaths as a result of this conflict stop justifying your argument? 100,000? 500,000? A million?!

I'm not claiming to have the answer to what were undoubtedly brutal regimes, but violence only ever breeds more violence. And perhaps if, IF these wars were about some sort of altruistic crusade to better this world for all the inhabitants of the Earth, then I might be inclined to look past your questionable justifications of added bloodshed. But we weren't.
 
 
 
But save them trillions?

 

In the short-term yes, the long run however...?
 
 
You know, i really was disappointed to listen to such sporadic vitriol, it's typical of contacted soldiers to speak so fervidly. If only there were only one speaker (besides Jeremy scahill) with first-hand smoking gun evidence about the gravity of this undesirable war.
What needs to be understood is that it's not the govt. who's winning in this occupation, it's the billions of dollars being exchanged by military industrial companies that hire soldiers—like the one you see there—directly from the army, by solicitation, and the subsequent lobbying for those companies subsidized by the tax payers who subsidize the party, and corporate guilds that fuel the perpetuation of this ridiculous war.

Yes

If you came into my house uninvited and started ****ting all over my living room, I too would slap you so hard you wouldn't know what hit you.
 

It's funny because that is exactly what the Baathist regime did to innocent Iraqi people for over two decades. But i suppose when it's America it's different? Flawless logic there friend  

 
To tarnish them all with the same 'they're all barbarians' brush is to have no emotional empathy with some of these people at all.
 

Exactly, I have no emotional empathy whatsoever for thugs and criminals who rape, butcher and threaten a civilian population into accepting their totalitarian rule once again.

 
For all your talk and allusions to the moral high ground, justifying yet even more murder would ironically lead me to question your own 'moral compass'.
 

I'm sorry, but I am not the one here advocating we do not remove a tyrant who pursued a crusade of genocide against an ethnic minority (killing hundreds of thousands of kurds, but the mass graves are still being exhumed) Wiped out another completely. (The marsh arabs land was utterly drained and destroyed. This is a culture that has been around for thousands and thousands of years.) Repressed an entire religious minority (The shiites were terrorised for decades) and pursued a reign of terror on his own civilians that makes Abu Graib look like laser quest.

So I suppose I am picking the lesser of two evils here. You have a choice. The American liberation and subsequent Iraqi republic. Or the absoutism of the Baathist regime.   Take your pick chum.

 
Just a question, at what point does the number of human being's deaths as a result of this conflict stop justifying your argument? 100,000? 500,000? A million?!
 

You will note that it is not western forces killing all of these people. It is the insurgents, y'know the thugs and criminals who want to rule with absolute power once more?

As long as they keep killing then the war should go on indefinitely. But oh no wait I forgot. You blame their actions on America, silly me.

 
I'm not claiming to have the answer to what were undoubtedly brutal regimes, but violence only ever breeds more violence.
 

And non-violence directly supports the violent.  

 
And perhaps if, IF these wars were about some sort of altruistic crusade to better this world for all the inhabitants of the Earth, then I might be inclined to look past your questionable justifications of added bloodshed. But we weren't.
 

I suggest you read up on

1) The history of Iraq
2) The Baathist regim
3) Iraqi society under said regime
4) Saddam's family
5) The war itself
6) Iraq now

Then perhaps we can actually have a debate rather than a simple reply to your unlettered tirade

They ARE completely incompatible, but there are still some braindead Islam apologists who STILL claim it is.

Look at Iraq and Afghanistan to see how much of an oxymoron 'islamic democracy' is.

alot of Muslim countries do not practice democracy, but that does not mean it is incompatible with islam.

the verse you quoted has nothing to do with democracy, it s merely a recommendation that Muslims consult each other before making important decisions, none of the tafsirs (commentaries) of this verse associate it with democracy.
you are correct in saying that previous Islamic empires did not use democracy, they inherited power, however the clergy at that time always told them that this was wrong but were powerless to do anything about it.

It showed that the Qu'ran isn't silent on the issue.

Nope, you're wrong. Only some inherited power from previous caliphate which is Islamically allowed as there are different methods to choosing a caliphate. Can you cite some evidence for the claim that the clergy were against some of the early caliphates (one of the best Muslims, btw)?

The Qura'an doesn't say that BUT: Democracy is supposed to guarantee things such as freedom from persecution, equality and so forth. Islam doesn't allow for these things, so an ''Islamic Democracy'' is an oxymoron, as a democracy is *supposed* to be secular, guaranteeing civil liberties etc. Under the current system, double standards have developed.

The thing is its not "I am a sufi" I have learnt from sufism. I wouldn't consider myself a sufi. At the heart of every person "I am a Muslim". At the heart of everything and nothing "there is nothing but Allah".

No one should be forced to identify with a sect when Allah has said not to but I suppose that's just my beleif, this beleif coming from what I have learnt

What I want to know is why so many leftist apologists treat the Muslim world as unthinking animals with no responsibility?

Your rather tiresome anti-Americanism borders on racism against those pitiful brown folk who know not what they are doing as they plant improvised explosive devices that butcher a supermarket of innocent Iraqi families. Or create mass graves in downtown Manhattan with passenger jet missiles.

 

Seeing as bombs haphazardly blowing up in Iraqi markets didn't happen on a daily basis before the American invasion, then it's completely logical to blame the insecurity on the failed American mission

 
Everything is always the fault of the 'west' regardless of the fact that those who liberated and supported the liberation recognise the complexity of society in that region, especially the fact that the vast, vast majority of its inhabitants are not fanatical barbarians. They are simply individuals like you and I who do not want to live under a r egime that slaughters women and children who dare learn how to read a book.
 

That never happened in Iraq. It's education system was a beacon of light in the Arab world, a role model for other countries. Especially in terms of women's education.

 
There are far more admirable principles to which one can subscribe that mean if the US decides to once more back tyrannical dictators in actual pursuit of mineral wealth and control of poorer countries. It is still possible to stand against it with equal vehemence.
 

cough, the Saudi regime, cough

Amen brother I would like nothing more than to see that regime obliterated. Unfortunately my vision is constrained by global realpolitik.

India is also young and is a very stable democracy, unlike Pakistan which has either been ruled by religious fanatics or military dictators.

This is despite both being part of the same country before independence.

What a coincidence that the Islamic part is ruled by tyrants.

Israel is younger than nearly all its neighbours, but is also stable, democratic and prosperous and at same time just so happens to be the only non-Islamic state in the region.

It's Islamic neighbours however are oppressive hellholes.

Funny that.

If you truly think that Zarqawi was the only factor in the insurguency then you are not worth my precious time.

There are far too many of you on this forum.

 
My point is that it's a bit hypocritical for the US to bring 'freedom' to the Iraqis, yet support a sexist regime oppressing the Saudis, just because the leaders are on the their side.
 

I don't care. That is not my argument, it never has been. I remain above all pragmatic and unlike yourself do not throw up petty boundaries like hypocrisy to stop me supporting the removal of a brutal tyrant.
 
 
 
Democracy believes in equal rights for all and tolerance, things which the Quran is staunchly opposed to.

 

If Islam is absolutely incompatible with western democracy. Then how come the vast majority of Muslims living in western democracy exist peacefully?

You really are quite dense.

There is a difference between Muslims and Islam. Islam encourages a totalitarian authoritarian theocracy. However, Muslims living in democratic countries are obliged to follow the law of the land they are in as long as it doesn't prohibit their religious duties. But, in Muslim majority countries, they are encouraged to overthrow the 'kuffar' regime to establish a Islamic state see secularist countries such as Egypt and Turkey who have a problem with Muslim fundamentalist.

 
You really are quite dense.  
 

He is generally (his even wrong now by saying democracy believes in tolerance and equality, you can say a sub-branch (liberal democracy) of democracy believes in that but democracy is simply majority rule) but on this account he is right.

Well can you please provide me of leaders of al-Qaeda in Iraq who were in a position in charge in the government of Saddam.

When you give a condescending response that 'people don't know anything about Iraq pre-2003', and then make horrendous claims that you don't provide evidence for, then by all means, don't waste my precious time.

 
I don't care. That is not my argument, it never has been. I remain above all pragmatic and unlike yourself do not throw up petty boundaries like hypocrisy to stop me supporting the removal of a brutal tyrant.
 

Well if hypocrisy isn't an issue for you, then how about the fact that the removal of a brutal tyrant was replaced with human right abuses by the US army in Iraq that is well documented by the international media. What was the point of bringing 'freedom' to a country yet continue the abuse of citizens and civilians?
 
 
Inspirational.
 
 
 
Yes

 

Yes?! So creating a quagmire in Iraq has brought great success and peace to the region? Your understanding of geopolitics is horribly maligned.

 
It's funny because that is exactly what the Baathist regime did to innocent Iraqi people for over two decades. But i suppose when it's America it's different? Flawless logic there friend  
 

No, you miss the point. It doesn't matter who it is. It could be China for all I care, I'd say the same thing. Somehow however I reckon you're the sort of person that would be up in arms if it were little asian people doing it instead, so convinced you are in our moral supremacy. What matters ESPECIALLY is whether that person in my house is respectful and whether my best interests are protected. At least under Saddam there was power, hospitals and a general increased standard in living and wages. Now half the infrastructure is bombed and the risk of death much greater.

Remind me, who bankrolled and sold weapons to the regime to fight Iran in the Eighties? Which American intelligence organization facilitated the Baath Party's rise to power? Who sat idly by as only a WEEK after the first Gulf War Saddam massacred the Kurdish population in the North, despite pleas from Iraqi Generals for US backing to over throw Saddam? Who in fact tacitly maintained a murderous regime which killed countless thousands of people? Who's hands is the blood really on?

 
Exactly, I have no emotional empathy whatsoever for thugs and criminals who rape, butcher and threaten a civilian population into accepting their totalitarian rule once again.
 

And not all the 'insurgents' fall into your blinkered stereotypes. Much like coalition soldiers who have been charged with, gotten away with, and even been filmed perpetrating the same crimes. Moral high ground, huh?

 
I'm sorry, but I am not the one here advocating we do not remove a tyrant who pursued a crusade of genocide against an ethnic minority (killing hundreds of thousands of kurds, but the mass graves are still being exhumed) Wiped out another completely. (The marsh arabs land was utterly drained and destroyed. This is a culture that has been around for thousands and thousands of years.) Repressed an entire religious minority (The shiites were terrorised for decades) and pursued a reign of terror on his own civilians that makes Abu Graib look like laser quest.
 

You do know that on average more people have died in the shorter period since 2003. But that's ok I suppose if Western involvement "isn't that bad". Hey, at least we're not Saddam!

 
So I suppose I am picking the lesser of two evils here. You have a choice. The American liberation and subsequent Iraqi republic. Or the absoutism of the Baathist regime.   Take your pick chum.
 

Hold on, so now we're not the all-saving good guys, but the lesser evil? Well, I suppose the Iraqi people should be thankful and eating out the palms of our hands for that!

 
You will note that it is not western forces killing all of these people. It is the insurgents, y'know the thugs and criminals who want to rule with absolute power once more?
 

Yeah, all those videos of Coalition Apaches shooting up farmers and innocent bystanders is just insurgent propaganda. Or our beloved intelligence services who outsource torture to equally corrupt and evil regimes who at least have the good grace to play bully's cohorts. I would suggest taking a look at Wikileaks and then come back to me.

 
As long as they keep killing then the war should go on indefinitely. But oh no wait I forgot. You blame their actions on America, silly me.
 

Sigh, if you think you can absolve blame from America for precipitating the current scenario where this was the result, then you are quite frankly beyond reason. Where was the post war strategy? Oh wait! They didn't have one!

 
And non-violence directly supports the violent.  
 

Tell that to Ghandi or even Nelson Mandela. But I'll go with negotiation and cooperation every time, thanks very much.

 
I suggest you read up on

1) The history of Iraq
2) The Baathist regim
3) Iraqi society under said regime
4) Saddam's family
5) The war itself
6) Iraq now

Then perhaps we can actually have a debate rather than a simple reply to your unlettered tirade  
 

I suggest you get your head out your arse, stop being such a condescending twit, recheck your facts, and perhaps read some of the leaked documents on Wikileaks in order for you to garner a proper understanding of the situation there.
 
 
 
all that stuff

 

^this.
 
 
 
Yes?! So creating a quagmire in Iraq has brought great success and peace to the region? Your understanding of geopolitics is horribly maligned.

 

A quagmire? This isn't 2006 chum.

Please list concisely the reasons you believe Iraq now is worse than it was under Saddam Hussein. These reasons must of course cover a broad spectrum, but it is fine to generalise. At least then I can know where you stand.

 
No, you miss the point. It doesn't matter who it is. It could be China for all I care, I'd say the same thing. Somehow however I reckon you're the sort of person that would be up in arms if it were little asian people doing it instead, so convinced you are in our moral supremacy. What matters ESPECIALLY is whether that person in my house is respectful and whether my best interests are protected. At least under Saddam there was power, hospitals and a general increased standard in living and wages. Now half the infrastructure is bombed and the risk of death much greater.
 

So as long as there is power and hospitals we can overlook two acts of genocide, one of mass religious repression and of course the torture and terror which served as the glue to hold it all together?

Marvellous I get a feeling you were a fan of the USSR.

 
Remind me, who bankrolled and sold weapons to the regime to fight Iran in the Eighties? Which American intelligence organization facilitated the Baath Party's rise to power?

Who in fact tacitly maintained a murderous regime which killed countless thousands of people? Who's hands is the blood really on?
 

Umm... A US administration which has been out of power for over two decades and is now mostly senile. You do realise that western democracy changes its leaders every so often?

I suppose you would have opposed the liberation of Iraq on the grounds of early US opression of the native American's. After all it would be hypocritical to remove a butchering tyrant after what Custer did to those Injuns.

 
And not all the 'insurgents' fall into your blinkered stereotypes. Much like coalition soldiers who have been charged with, gotten away with, and even been filmed perpetrating the same crimes. Moral high ground, huh?
 

Of course they do. The insurgents are fighting to establish theocratic control over the Iraqi people. The coalition forces are fighting to give control at least partially to the Iraqi people.

Do you support the former or the latter principle?

 
You do know that on average more people have died in the shorter period since 2003. But that's ok I suppose if Western involvement "isn't that bad". Hey, at least we're not Saddam!
 

You do realise that the vast majority of those people were killed by insurgents and not western forces?

Oh no wait I forgot, as far as you are concerned these poor brown fools blowing themselves up are not advanced enough to be responsible for their own actions. Everything is America's fault... isn't it?

 
Hold on, so now we're not the all-saving good guys, but the lesser evil? Well, I suppose the Iraqi people should be thankful and eating out the palms of our hands for that!
 

This isn't about moral equivalence you moron. I am a pragmatist and will take victory over totalitarianism wherever I can.

Now I ask you again, do you support the removal of Saddam, or would you ahve preffered he remained in power eventually to be succeeded by one of his sons. Realistically they are your only two options.

 
Yeah, all those videos of Coalition Apaches shooting up farmers and innocent bystanders is just insurgent propaganda.
 

One video but it is telling that you are forced to exaggeratte. Your argument is worthless anyway. I condemn these acts as vehemently as any Islamist terror.

 
Or our beloved intelligence services who outsource torture to equally corrupt and evil regimes who at least have the good grace to play bully's cohorts. I would suggest taking a look at Wikileaks and then come back to me.
 

Haha, for all Julian Assanges rhetoric about ending American wars he continually shoots himself in the foot. These most recent leakes reveal post-cold war America not as the warmongering monolith you would so dearly love it to be. But a reluctant peacekeeper that is sometimes forced to act.

Assange is doing me a favour. Perhaps you should read wikilieaks??

 
Sigh, if you think you can absolve blame from America for precipitating the current scenario where this was the result, then you are quite frankly beyond reason. Where was the post war strategy? Oh wait! They didn't have one!
 

I have often criticisied the way the war was fought. Yet that does not affeect my argument at all. Once again It is telling that you resort to such strawmen.

 
Tell that to Ghandi
 

Ahh yes the same Ghandi who's answer to the holocaust was for every Jew to commit suicide. Great hero right there.

 
I suggest you get your head out your arse, stop being such a condescending twit,
 

It is really hard not to be condescending when engaging in a discussion with individuals like yourself who read one or two articles in the New Statesman and commense to repeat fatuous slogans like BlIar Is WoR CrImInaL.

Read a book on the subject instead of the snippets and summaries you browse on wikipedia and wikileaks and then come back to me. Perhaps this debate may become productive.

As far as your arguments are concerned I have heard them all before on this forum as have all the others who continually obliterate apologists for totalitarianism like yourself.

The fact that; given the incredible amount of complex literature surrounding this issue the major point of reference you suggest to me is wikileaks just reveals how much of a part-timer you are on this issue. I bet that you haven't done any substantial reading whatsoever outside of the internet. It's almost too easy to swat you away.

Have a nice day.  
 
 
 
I was reading an article which said that India had accounted for approximately 22% of the global GDP and China 25% prior to the British Rule. And, what you left behind were some of the poorest nations in the world. You are like those niche villains!

 

Most of the wealth you're talking about was concentrated at the hands of very few which were simply born into the right caste.

Because of the caste system, the vast majority of Indians have always lived in poverty and British rule actually provided them jobs which they could not obtain otherwise. This is especially true for the "Untouchables".

And don't forget that human sacrifice was common until the British made them stop it.

So it wasn't all bad.
 
 
 
If Islam is absolutely incompatible with western democracy. Then how come the vast majority of Muslims living in western democracy exist peacefully?

 

Because we have seperation of church and state you oaf.

We discourage fusing religion with politics.

And if Islam is so compatible with democracy how come virtually every country with an Islamic majority is an oppressive hellhole?

 
You really are quite dense.  

 

And you really are a patronising twit with no grasp on reality.  
 
 
 
I think in your earlier post you described Israel as the only democracy in the Middle East. But it clearly doesn't have equal rights for all. But you still ignored that, and considered it a democracy. You clearly have something against Muslims and Muslim countries. Sort it out mate  

 

How about instead of blaming all their problems on us, Muslims sort out their own countries, and actually try and live in peace with other religions and nations instead of murdering them?

Excuse me for a minute, I think I just saw a flock of pigs fly by my window.
 
 
 
And if Islam is so compatible with democracy how come virtually every country with an Islamic majority is an oppressive hellhole?

 

If economically disadvantaged countries are so compatible with democracy, how comes virtually every country that is economically disadvantaged is a corrupt, illiberal hellhole?

As much as I was in agreement the vast majority of your argument, you do Ghandi a great diservice by paraphrasing his words so crudely!

No you have just dodged my point completely. If Islam is incompatible with democracy then Muslims should be incompatible with it as well.

Why do so many Muslims live peacefully in western democracy? The seperation of church and state has nothing to do with this. If Islam is incompatible then so are Muslims. Evidently reality utterly disproves your vacuous observation.  
 
 
 
As much as I was in agreement the vast majority of your argument, you do Ghandi a great diservice by paraphrasing his words so crudely!

 

No I am not sir. I can assure you I have read a sufficient amount to understand Ghandi and the quote I attributed to him. If you wish to read into it then I would suggest George Orwell's Reflections on Ghandi.

Ghandi was one big contradiction, an Indian Rousseau with half the intellect.
 
 
I think the short answer to the question is 'no.'

The long answer is obviously more complex than that, but I would argue that the fundamental postulation still stands. Say what you like about the 'West,' - and there's a lot to say (particularly about supporting dictatorships in the Arab world) - but in Afghanistan and Iraq the differences between Western forces and their opponents are quite clear. There are certainly instances of deaths of civilians in these countries by NATO troops (in Afghanistan), and, indeed, some of these deaths are the result of deliberate and blatant murder by American troops (see: Haditha in Iraq for one example).

But whilst these incidents are the exception, they are the rule for the people which the West is fighting. One need only look at the civil war in Iraq, where Al Qaeda in Iraq butchered hundreds of thousands in countless car/suicide bombs and mass executions for the sole purpose of spreading terror. If they only attacked Western 'occupiers,' then maybe it could be argued that they were 'righteous,' but the fact is they murder women and children ON PURPOSE and en masse. The American Goverrnment doesn't condone, or indeed, carry out, massive attacks on civilians as a matter of policy. Which is fundamentally different to what either the Taliban, but especially the insurgents in Iraq did.

The whole question of 'should we imposing our values on others' is, I think, immaterial in this case. The fact is Western troops, broadly speaking, most of the time, behave with respect towards the populations in which they come into contact.

They don't load truck bombs with TNT and drive them into market places.
 
 
 
No you have just dodged my point completely. If Islam is incompatible with democracy then Muslims should be incompatible with it as well.

 

You completely dodged mine. You still haven't explained why Islamic majority countries are almost always ruled by a dictator.

 
Why do so many Muslims live peacefully in western democracy?

 

HAHAHAHAHA!

Look at the reaction of Muslims in the UK whenever someone criticises their 'faith' publically i.e. violent outrage.

Look at the Dispatches documentary on the IFE and Tower Hamlets, or Undercover Mosque.

Or this:

 http://www.newenglishreview.org/blog.../blog_id/30249 

Evidently you're in denial, but I'd expect nothing less from left wingers who'd bend over backwards to defend anything Islamic.
 
 
 
If economically disadvantaged countries are so compatible with democracy, how comes virtually every country that is economically disadvantaged is a corrupt, illiberal hellhole?  

 

Why are they economically disadvantaged?

Perhaps because Islam refuses to move forward, and these countries are still stuck in the 7th century as a result.

HAHAHAHAHA!

Hmm, it seems to me that you are generalising. Surely you are not suggesting that millions of Mulsims take to the streets every time this happens. Because myself and the rest of the British population seem to have missed this.

We always seem to see the same band of sixty to seventy extremists burning flags and effigies. But no no, you are of course right. They are all the Muslims in the UK  

  I really do wonder how your brain comes to these conclusions.
 
 
 
No I am not sir. I can assure you I have read a sufficient amount to understand Ghandi and the quote I attributed to him. If you wish to read into it then I would suggest George Orwell's Reflections on Ghandi.

Mehh, Orwell was a procovative scholar, he always challenged the status quo. Regardless of whether he believed it or not. I would throw some book titles on the subject back at you but its probably pointless, I can see your pragmstic view of the world and history would fail to understand the beauty of Ghandian philosophy!

This makes no sense whatsoever. Beauty is subjective and pragmatism is merely a way of dealing with reality while staying true to certain principles.

As far as I am concerned Ghandi was a walking contradiction. Orwell had it spot on.

Pragmatism is a way of discerning the truth of an idea by its practical, and observable value. Laudable, but not really applicable to Ghandi's philosophy.

Anyway, we can conclude this sidebar. Please carry on with your highly entertaining debate which I so rudely interrupted.

Truth is a metaphysical illusion. Pragmatism is merely a way for me to pursue certain values and ideology in a practical manner applicable to the complexity of reality.

It is not applicable to Ghandi's philosophy because it is necessarily self-defeating in a realisitc context, and besides, that is not why I disagree with him. As I have said before, it the contradiction.

Naturally. The ascetiscm of Ghandi makes it highly unlikely that his particular creed will ever be realised. You, on the one hand, see this as self-defeating. I, on the other, see it as a testament to the great little man.

To the contradiction. One example, I presume, is his view on the holocaust. I can see that you take your argument past the old, boring, and repetitive 'oh well killing yourself is violent so ghandis a liar'. Ghandi did talk of the jews submitting to the Nazi's will (obviously death), but he never spoke of the sort of mass suicide that Orwell mentions.

Submitting to a murderous regime is not something I would ever be keen on doing myself, but the principle behind it, ahimsa, is aimed at the greater goal. Whatever your views on Ghandi, I assume you wouldn't deny the fact that he was willing to lay down his own life for his cause? Or anyway, that is the view of many distiguished scholars. Nussbaum in particualar is very good on this.

Anyway, as I find myself scrutinising my own thoughts on Ghandi, I just need to remind myself of 'Britain's greatest PM', Churchill, and his words on Ghandi, to reassert how special a human being the later really was.

"It is alarming and also nauseating to see Mr. Gandhi, a seditious middle temple lawyer, now posing as a fakir of a type well known in the east, striding half-naked up the steps of the viceregal palace, while he is still organizing and conducting a defiant campaign of civil disobedience, to parley on equal terms with the representative of the king-emperor." - really, Winston?

Under Islamic Law only men have full rights.

Non-Muslims are nearly always persecuted in Islamic majority countries.

How is that compatible with democracy?

Is it purely a coincidence that the only democracy in the Middle East is the only non-Islamic state?

You can try try and brush it aside with your arguments about 'socio-economic reasons' but at the end of the day it's Islam which is the issue.

 
Besides, your entire argument is obliterated when one points out simply that the vast majority of Muslims living in western democracy do so peacefully. OMG!! THEY EVEN VOTE!!!  .

 

Usually voting for parties like Labour that pander to their sensibilities at every opportunity.

Let's not forget Ken Livingstone quite happily whipped up anti-semitism under the guise of protesting Israel to grab Muslim votes, not forgetting trying to pass Yusuf al-Qaradawi off as a 'moderate'.

But the Muslims still took part in the democratic process. Unless your argument is utter nonsense that would be impossible.

The more Islamic a country becomes, the more tyrannical it gets, Turkey being a key example.

Muslims in the West are utterly irrelevant, since Islam isn't the dominant cultural force over here and they've been influenced by Western culture too much.

 
:But the vast majority of Muslims still live peacefully in western democracy. Thus your argument is null and void.  

 

Until I see a country with a Muslim majority and an Islamic culture that respects human rights, practices democracy successfully and treats everyone equally, your argument has no basis in reality whatsoever.

It's you who's been humiliated, I guess Islam's not so peaceful anymore?
 
 
 
India is also young and is a very stable democracy, unlike Pakistan which has either been ruled by religious fanatics or military dictators.

This is despite both being part of the same country before independence.

What a coincidence that the Islamic part is ruled by tyrants.

Israel is younger than nearly all its neighbours, but is also stable, democratic and prosperous and at same time just so happens to be the only non-Islamic state in the region.

It's Islamic neighbours however are oppressive hellholes.

Funny that.

 

God that's so ****ing ignorant I don't even know where to begin...  

Edit: forget it - you've already been ripped to shreds.
 
 
 
Hang on a minute.

You've been arguing Islam is perfectly compatible with democracy, but now you admit it's not entirely compatible?

It's you who's been humiliated, I guess Islam's not so peaceful anymore?

 

Now you're just embarrassing yourself.  

You said that Islam is incompatible with democracy. I said that this simply was not true because so many millions of Muslims live peacefully in the west.

Now, engage your tiny brain and tell me where I implied that Islam was entirely compatible with democracy?

I didn't. Now stop pathetically trying to save face, everybody can see right through it. Just admit you were wrong.

This argument is utterly flawed since neofascists also vote in elections for their parties.

Does this mean their ideology is compatible with democracy?

Millions of people still vote for the communists in Russia. Is communism compatible with democracy, despute the fact that these communists live peacefully?

As for Pakistan and India:

They are evil just like the rest of them. BUT the millions innocent civilians would be alive under their regime and not sexual and physical abused and shot randomly from cars and suffer racism in their own home land. So therfore ther are the lesser evil in my belief.

 

so according to you saddam hussain gassing the kurds in their home land wasn't racially motivated?

i suppose you also think it was better in afghanistan when women were sold into relationships and regually beaten and no one belived them because a mans word is worth more than a womans?

But then again i suppose your just ignorant to all that, beliving what you see and hear on tv and in the newspapers.

Evidently it does, bearing in mind that the greatest fascist movement of the 20th century emerged via democracy. (I am not expecting you to know anything about this. I suggest you google Nazi Party   )

FFS engage your brain. Democracy at its core is merely a method by which the public votes for the leadership. You need to perhaps study basic history and get a grip on reality. Nothing has ever been absolute. You say that Islam is incompatible with democracy and that suggests that Muslims cannot exist in a democracy and democracy cannot exist when there are Muslims. The same goes for fascists, communists everything. You are completely wrong. The fact you stubbornly refuse to accept fact reveals to me that you are not very well read at all and do not understand the concepts being discussed in this thread.

This is where I will leave it. I hope you have learnt something.

And great! A video trying to teach me about my own country. Even a 10 year old Indian schoolboy will be able to tell you how ****ing stupid these BNP-endorsed videos are; it's a shame that a grown man with the benefits of an enlightened education still can't see past racist propaganda.

I pity you.

That is complete rubbish.

Democracy is not just voting and elections.

It includes equal rights for all regardless of race, religion and gender, basic freedoms and human rights, and countless other concepts.

Yes Islam, communism and Nazism are compatible with voting and elections but voting is ONE element of democracy.

Being compatible with one element is NOT the same as being compatible with the whole thing, this is very basic common sense.

Islam is compatible with voting and elections but NOT democracy.

Yes, a video by an INDIAN MUSLIM is obviously BNP endorsed.

It would double your intelligence.

No, this is complete rubbish.

No, it doesn't. These are the attributes of a liberal democracy, there is a difference. The UK has been a democracy for a long time and I wouldn't say it gave equal rights regardless of race, religion and gender for all that period that it has been a democracy same with the US.

No it doesn't. I am going to use the most simple dictionary definition going because evidently you don't know anything.

Democracy:
# a political system in which the supreme power lies in a body of citizens who can elect people to represent them
# majority rule: the doctrine that the numerical majority of an organized group can make decisions binding on the whole group

Yes Islam, communism and Nazism are compatible with voting and elections but voting is ONE element of democracy.
 

No, power in the citizens ie:voting. Is democracy in its most basic form.

 
Being compatible with one element is NOT the same as being compatible with the whole thing, this is very basic common sense.
 

You misunderstand the 'whole thing' evidently.

 
Islam is compatible with voting and elections
 

Finally you admit defeat. That'll do pig.

If anyone needed evidence that your knowledge of politics is severely lacking, thank you fo providing it. Genuinely, you lack even the most basic knowledge of the study of democratic thought and theory.
 
 
Democracy :

Demos = people
Cratein = rule

=> Rule of the people / Rule by the people

What is "the people" ?
Athenians thought it was only white, rich Athenians (free men).

It boils down to what is part of the people.

Don't thank me.

The fact you deny freedom and equality are basic parts of modern democratic theory shows you don't know what you're talking about.

 http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/...ection%3D1317b 

"And one is for a man to live as he likes; for they say that this is the function of liberty, inasmuch as to live not as one likes is the life of a man that is a slave."

'Live as he likes' couldn't sound more like freedom.

I don't know why I'm talking about ancient democracy, read ANY textbook on MODERN democracy and they'll all pretty much agree that freedom and equality are an absolute MUST for a modern democracy.
 
 
  Urgh.......

And I will direct you to Aristotle who makes it quite clear freedom is a central principle of democracy.

Taking a quote from an internet site without understanding the context makes you look like an utter idiot.

If you had actually read Aristotle you would realise that he believes in natural slavery; and that certain members of the human race can only be free and at liberty when at the mercy of their natural superiors. Slavery, in many cases is liberty according to aristotle. The quote you have copy and pasted above is entirely consistent with this. The entire first Book of his Politics is dedicated to this issue!

Aristotle did not even advocate democracy.  
 
 
 
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ARISTOTLE YOU MORON!!

And what about modern democracy?

Putting aside all the issues with its Athenian incarnation, are you seriously going to argue that freedom and equality are not integral to a modern democratic state?

Read ANY modern textbook on democracy and you'll pretty much find they all agree that protected freedoms and equality of all citizens are CENTRAL to a democracy in the modern age.

This is really getting desperate now. Your original argument had nothing to do with a modern democracy. It was simply Islam is incompatible with democracy.

Evidently that fatuous statement has been utterly exploded, thus you are backtracking pathetically. Perhaps if you were more willing to learn, and were less narrow-minded I would take this discussion further... but you aren't so I am not.

Why would I be talking about anything else?

You clearly know absolutely nothing whatsoever about the Taliban and Baathist regimes because all of that happened and more.

Educate yourself before making innane and unlettered posts on a forum that has seen it all before.

First of all however I would like you to validate your claim that millions have died. As far as I am aware the conservative estimate is around 130,000 and the majority of those deaths were caused by insurgents, after all the biggest killers of the local population in Iraq and Afghanistan are not the armies of the 'west'.

Then I would like you to provide me with evidence that none of the above atrocities occured enmasse under Saddam or the Taliban.

You clearly have no substantial texts on the topic so I suggest you wikipedia/google Saddam's 'rape rooms' and secret police, the mass graves that continued to be exhumed each day, the genocide of Iraqi Kurds namely the massacre at Halabja but also the vicious campaign that swept Iraqi Kurdistan of hundreds and thousands. Perhaps you should also google the mass opression of the Iraqi Shiite population. The links from these topics alone will keep you reading for hours.

As for the Taliban perhaps you can start with something simple like their campaign against the education of women which included the slaughter of those who even attempted to read a book. Then the campaign on music and non-beard wearing men. Then you could move on to the attempted genocide by the Taliban against Afghanistans ethnic Hazara population and the violent repression of all other ethnic minorities. The mass sexual abuse by Taliban officials of young dancing boys and the slaughter of children born to political enemies.

I could go on and on and on you clearly cannot so get reading or just shut up.

You will quickly discover that in actually studying this topic your arguments will be utterly obliterated.

 

this is by far the most useless argument I have read !

To mention specifically one or two bad things about a group is just dumb.. you have to look at the good and the bad.

You're obviously pro-war, as such I assume you have a stance that the soldiers over at Iraq & Afghanistan are doing ''great, fantastic messianic" work.. You'd be slapped around the face for thinking that, especially after the commendable Wikileaks exposure about the war and the soldiers operating there.

I have no idea why you mentioned Saddam Hussein.. seeing as he has already died, and has been since 2006. How would you explain the last four years??

as for the Taliban, forgive if I'm wrong but, the same Taliban were funded by the US during the Russian invasion in the 80's. They funded them with weapons, money, and the tools to take over the land.. and now they want to get rid of them?? Ironic isn't it  

The war in Afghanistan started in 2001, because the western governments claimed that Bin Laden was hiding there and the Taliban were willing to hand him over to another country in exchange for the war to stop..  http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001...tan.terrorism5 

whereas, the war in Iraq started in 2003 due to the UK and the US claiming that Saddam Hussein had WMD's.. this claim was proven to be a lie..  http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7634313/...east/n_africa/ 
the inquiry into whether Iraq really had WMD's was first being administrated by Dr. Kelly, he was soon found dead.

Both of the wars were created on reasons which made no sense, and now that they are being exposed by Wikileaks, Western governments are doing all in their capacity to block the truth from being shown. Julian Assange is now in a position where some US leaders are calling for his execution!..  http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010...-mike-huckabee 

I find it despicable that some people are still heedless about the wars and choose to support them. everyday innocent lives are bought to an end by a fight that should never have taken place.

so please do your research mate before you fill your head with media propaganda

"To mention specifically one or two bad things about a group is just dumb.. you have to look at the good and the bad"

Your argument failed as soon as you began with that.

All you are basing your argument on is the supposed nefarious intentions of the Americans and their allies.

Let us assume that premise to be true.

I am not sure how that means that the Taliban and Saddam Regimes are better than any American based alternative.

Have a nice day.  

 
I have no idea why you mentioned Saddam Hussein.. seeing as he has already died, and has been since 2006. How would you explain the last four years??
 

A Baathist and Islamist insurgency. I get the feeling you don't know much about this conflict.

  My observations were correct, you know nothing about this. The Taliban did not come into existence until 1994. You should google the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and check what the date was when they retreated.

 
Both of the wars were created on reasons which made no sense, and now that they are being exposed by Wikileaks,
 

Perhaps you should actually read the wikileaks. Because I can assure you that they are not. In fact, to some extent they are being justified. As is the worry about Iran.

The first is a guide to political thought; essentially a text book. The second is an opinion piece by a former, and little known judge about the relationship between the judiciary and the government.  

I thought you were talking about substantial political philosophers! Rousseau, Mill, Hume, Burke, Locke, Berlin, Rawls, Nozick etc..etc...etc...

Your question itself reveals just how little you understand this topic. The fact you already seem to posess some universal and absolute definition of 'modern democracy' reveals more about you than any argument can.

No, thats a part of liberal democracy. There can be a democracy without those things. Democracy doesn't inherently have constitutional guarantees of liberty. Now you've shifted the goalposts to 'modern democracy'.

Oh, and by the way, I've read a lot more textbooks about this than you have, evidently. Read 'The Future of Freedom' by Fareed Zakaria, 'On Democracy' and 'Democracy and It's Critics' by Dahl, and some Held as well.

Yes, but liberal democracy is the dominant form of democratic government in the present age, and this is what can be said to be 'modern' democracy.

Put it this way:

North Korea, Burma, and Zimbabwe have elections where representatives are elected to an assembly but we don't define them as 'democracies'.

Great Britain, the United States, Canada and France also have elections where representatives are elected to an assembly but are defined as 'democracies'.

Why is this so?

Let's put it this way.

Liberal democracy is by far the most widespread form of democracy in the world in modern times, and it is liberal democracy that I understand as 'modern democracy'.

It takes many forms, including federal republics, constitutional monarchies, and presidential republics.

I firmly believe Islam is incompatible with liberal democracy for the reasons I've repeatedly listed.

Great Britain, the United States, Canada and France also have elections where representatives are elected to an assembly but are defined as 'democracies'.

Why is this so?

 

Because the elections in the former have no effect on the leadership, not because they don't guarantee liberty in their political system.

There is nothing inherently liberal about democracy. The two issues are separate, and rightly so - this is very clear in literature concerning democratic thought. Please, read it.

Oh so now it is liberal democracy?

That is the second time you have changed your criteria. I am glad you are learning something about democracy though.

But the question still remains. If Muslims are incompatible with liberal democracy. How do so many millions exist peacefully and without trouble in said society?

Perhaps you should shift the goalposts once more with regards to what you are implying. Islam as a political system itself is exactly that, so saying it is incompatible with democracy is pretty ridiculous, because of course it is. That is akin to saying that an absolutist monarchy is incompatible with democracy. Well duh!

What I am contending here is your insinuation that Muslims are incompatible with western democracy. Evidently that is simply not true whatsoever for western democracies and so there is no reason for it to be true anywhere else.

Fair enough, but we must make a distinction between the faith and the followers.

I have no doubt Muslims as people can practice democracy but I believe the faith itself is incompatible with liberal demcoracy.

As a faith, Islam is intolerant and bigotted with women and non-Muslims placed firmly as subordinate (I believe the same of most other faiths too).

Homosexuals and apostates fare even worse with the death penalty accepted in all four schools of Islamic jurisprudence as the punishment for these acts.

Ayaan Hirsi Ali puts this across far better than I can:

A quagmire? This isn't 2006 chum.

Please list concisely the reasons you believe Iraq now is worse than it was under Saddam Hussein. These reasons must of course cover a broad spectrum, but it is fine to generalise. At least then I can know where you stand.

 

Here are a few things the conflict has left in its wake.

* Daily secrtarian violence brought on by the conflict. The country is on the brink of civil war.
* Massive political uncertainty leaving the country lawless.
* The entire Middle East region now more unstable than before the war began, threatening new regional conflicts.
* Corrupt officials and police force.
* A shattered economy where it is now second from bottom in Purchasing Power Parity Figures With Other Countries In The Region.
* Damaged state institutions and indeed, an established social fabric which will take generations to repair.
* Life expectancy has decreased from an average of 65 years in 1987 to 58.2 in 2006. This was not only due to violence, but the poor quality in services that resulted from Coalition bombing of infrastructure and years of sanctions. It is now the third least healthy country in the Arab world. Iraqis have a 19.4% chance of not surviving past 40 years old. Only Sudan at 26.1% and Djibouti at 28.6% were worse off. Infant mortality rates are also unfavourable compared with its neighbours.
* Child malnutrition has scarcely improved since the invasion, despite having gone through the best part of 15 years of sanctions.
* Since the invasion the new Iraqi government ended subsidies on electricity and fuel which allowed inflation to remain at 12% between 1996 and 2002. Since this move, inflation skyrockets to 71.6% as fuel and energy prices shot up 590% (five-hundred-and-ninety) from 2002 - 2005. It continued on the upward trend 129% 2005-2006. In the 1980s and 1990s, the average Iraqi family spent 11% of its income on fuel and electricity. Post-conflict they were spending 35%. The Iraqi central bank has only just got a grip on this lunacy.
* The Iraqi economy is now MUCH more dependent on oil than before because of the decline in other sectors, accounting for near 70% of its GDP. Industry, which accounted for 9% of the economy before the war, now only accounts for 1.5%. Farming, which was 35% in the 1970s, is now around 6.5% after the war. Further, oil is not particularly labour intensive, seeing only 2% of the labour force employed in that sector. Thus, 98% of Iraqis are employed in businesses which only contribute 30% to the economy. This is the reason why the government is the largest employer in the country, because not only is it safe and steady work, but it provides one of the few opportunities in Iraq since the private sector is so small. In turn, the labor market is distorted as the government starves businesses of workers.

(N.B. U.S. attempts to improve the economy have only made the situation worse. The Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) tried to implement free market and free trade reforms. This led to the lifting of tariffs that opened up the country to a flood of cheap imports, which caused major problems for many small businesses and farms. The CPA also cut support for Iraq's state-owned industries that accounted for 90% of industrial capacity and employed around 500,000. Eventually the CPA decided to help some of these businesses, but by then 2/3 of them had closed. Since 2007 the U.S. has tried to bring back many of these companies to very mixed results.)

i.e. Per capita, Iraqis now are admittedly earning more than before 2003, but not up to the level Iraq reached in the 1980s. Now, had there been no sanctions during the 1990s, it would be even more interesting to see what standards would have been reached. In nearly all categories, Iraq ranks near the bottom of the list in comparison with its neighbours.

 
So as long as there is power and hospitals we can overlook two acts of genocide, one of mass religious repression and of course the torture and terror which served as the glue to hold it all together?

Marvellous I get a feeling you were a fan of the USSR.
 

No. Again you go off on your high horse, hearing what you want to hear. But then, you probably had your hands over your ears singing la la la as US-UK sanctions according to United Nations estimates lead to the death of 500,000 Iraqi children and over a million Iraqis total.

But yeah, sod it. Cut the power, take away their hospitals and let more people die! And then build Abu Gharib and continue the Ba-athist practices! Great scott! Genius!

 
Umm... A US administration which has been out of power for over two decades and is now mostly senile. You do realise that western democracy changes its leaders every so often?
 

We are talking about concurrent US policies which manifests itself in every administration, irregardless of who the new face is. It's always the same ****; you keep those who are useful and turn a blind eye to their activities until they no longer become of use. You want a more recent example? Honduras. If you honestly think our elected officials are all different and are not pursuing the same objectives (i.e. extension of their own power and wealth) then you are delusional. If your vision of the world were all roses and sunshine then the Bush administration would have gone crusading around Zimbabwe, Iran and North Korea. But they didn't, because it wasn't in their interest.

 
I suppose you would have opposed the liberation of Iraq on the grounds of early US opression of the native American's. After all it would be hypocritical to remove a butchering tyrant after what Custer did to those Injuns.
 

You know who else called themselves liberators? The USSR when they 'freed their polish brethren'. You see how flimsy that word becomes?

It wasn't a liberation. It was an invasion. Pure and simple. The fact that you buy into what the rightist media tells you to help you sleep at night only makes me pity you. I was like you at first, bought into the whole "oh, well, at least Saddam is gone". Then you start to realise that there's something horribly wrong about this picture and how dispicable it all is. We didn't go to liberate them. That was never the intention. There was never any post-war plan, only a funny little man who we put there in the first place because we thought he'd play ball before he got a little over-confident and we had to sort him out. If you can't see how sick the larger picture is, how twisted the great game is and the untold sufferring it causes from your vantage point of armchair general, then I call your humanity into question. All we've brought a long sufferring people is even more sufferring and greater regional uncertainty.

 
Of course they do. The insurgents are fighting to establish theocratic control over the Iraqi people. The coalition forces are fighting to give control at least partially to the Iraqi people.

Do you support the former or the latter principle?
 

For someone who claims to have read so much on the matter I'm surprised at your failure to distinguish between the different splinter groups comprising the insurgency. There are many groups, each with a different set of goals.

Regardless, The Coalition, just like the insurgents, are fighting to establish their preferred power. Nothing more, nothing less. Both 'principles' are the same, and both notions offend me. I support freedom in its purest sense, and believe no man should be dictated to.

 
You do realise that the vast majority of those people were killed by insurgents and not western forces?

Oh no wait I forgot, as far as you are concerned these poor brown fools blowing themselves up are not advanced enough to be responsible for their own actions. Everything is America's fault... isn't it?
 

Wait wait wait. That's laughable. It is you who is suggesting Iraqis are not capable of looking after themselves and need the coalition and their McDonalds to show them the way of civilization, not I.

Come now, we've all seen how the US military classes its kills as 'insurgents'. But yes, I will not dispute that most of it is Iraqi-on-Iraqi. Now, here's the question. Would this virtual civil war in a fragile country with many different groups of people have kicked off without the War as a catalyst? Don't forget, these deaths are a result of the conflict as a wider spectre. You cannot compartmentalise like that. You cannot walk in, blow **** up, rip up the very fabric of a country, and then wash your hands of it all like an irresponsible little child.

 
This isn't about moral equivalence you moron. I am a pragmatist and will take victory over totalitarianism wherever I can.
 

Of course it is! It's the central tennant of your argument! Your entire position is founded on the belief that the Iraq War was good because we've removed a dictator that we put there in the first place. But then, the age-old criticism of pragmatists is that they always have been rather short-sighted.

 
Now I ask you again, do you support the removal of Saddam, or would you ahve preffered he remained in power eventually to be succeeded by one of his sons. Realistically they are your only two options.
 

Not in the manner it was done, no. Violence only ever breeds violence and the statistics only support me. I do not think that the removal of Saddam has changed much for the ordinary Iraqi and there is a definite case, as I outlined above, that they are now worse off.

In a system that perpetuates itself as ours does, the options becomes limited. And THAT is what is wrong with this planet as whole. Not some constrained choices that we are left with as a result of structure at large. We create our own realities, and frankly, the one we're in is barbaric and makes no sense.

 
One video but it is telling that you are forced to exaggeratte. Your argument is worthless anyway. I condemn these acts as vehemently as any Islamist terror.
 

Point being, that video was SMUGGLED out and leaked. God knows what other gun cam footage is out there. But you don't have to take my word for Coalition atrocities. Type in some keywords about US military atrocities and tell me what you find. There's some nice testimonies on YouTube from former soldiers, just to get you started.

 
Haha, for all Julian Assanges rhetoric about ending American wars he continually shoots himself in the foot. These most recent leakes reveal post-cold war America not as the warmongering monolith you would so dearly love it to be. But a reluctant peacekeeper that is sometimes forced to act.
 

I dearly wish it wasn't, but for a nation that has had a war every ten years or so, you can't help but suspect. You also can't help but notice the enormity of the military industrial complex and how war is actually good business in America. Very good business. If you believe America is our shining beacon of moral guidance in the world I truly, truly hope you go and have a look at the craziness going on in that country and reconsider. If you're such a pragmatist you should be able to recognise realpolitik when it walks up and slaps you round the face.

And for the record, I wasn't referring to the latest diplomatic cables, but leaks prior to those including Bradley Manning's leaks and the 'Iraq War Logs'.

 
I have often criticisied the way the war was fought. Yet that does not affeect my argument at all. Once again It is telling that you resort to such strawmen.
 

Yet at every turn you seek to absolve blame of the Coalition and remain adamant that we're doing a bang-up job there. Again, this feeds back into your argument that ultimately, this course of action was the right thing to do.

 
Ahh yes the same Ghandi who's answer to the holocaust was for every Jew to commit suicide. Great hero right there.
 

Taken out of context and used as a cheap character assassination against a man who showed the world how non-violent methods can achieve political aims.

The point of the jewish comment (which he extended to all peoples fighting the Axis), was never to submit to tyranny and to take control of your own destiny in order to make a larger statement which will win out in the end. Whether you agree with this in particular is neither here nor there and to use it in the context you did was low.

 
It is really hard not to be condescending when engaging in a discussion with individuals like yourself who read one or two articles in the New Statesman and commense to repeat fatuous slogans like BlIar Is WoR CrImInaL.
 

First, I've never read the New Statesmen in my life. Second, I have a Masters degree in War Studies so am firmly acquainted with the principles and philosophies of conflict, especially this one as it is one of the most overused examples. Third. You have not once shown one iota of the 'superior knowledge' you claim to have, nor have you cited anything credible in defence of your arguments. You've gone only by hearsay and when challenged have brushed it off with 'go read a book'. I'm willing to bet you have perhaps read one or two books at most which pander to your beliefs, perhaps you even wrote an essay on a small facet of the conflict for university and now consider yourself a qualified expert in the matter. But the large amount of your rhetoric is old, recycled garbage which comes straight from the neo-con hymn sheets for the masses. Perhaps you would kindly point me to this literature you have three times now failed to name.

I, as a human being have a moral compass and I know right from wrong. Unfortunately you are unable to comprehend what I'm saying to you. I am not coming at you as a socialist, a liberal or whatever other paradigm you think you've classified me as. But this is how you conceive everything, through one dimension, only able to view the topic through George Bush's looking glass: "You're either with us or you are a terrorist". This leads you to rashly spout off about 'totalitarian apologists' rather than critically think for one moment about what I'm trying to convey. In that, I cannot help you.

Oh, and wikileaks was in reference to ACTUAL US DOCUMENTS as to the cluster**** that is Iraq. If you want to bury your head in the sand and official primary evidence from the horse's mouth, then you can gtfo.
 
 
 
Here are a few things the conflict has left in its wake.

* Daily secrtarian violence brought on by the conflict. The country is on the brink of civil war.

 

The country under Saddam, was involved in a long running brutal civil war in which Saddam and many of the sectarians massacaring civilians everyday right now pursued genocide against the Kurdish population and an oppressive campaign against the Shia. But of course, don't let that stop you from denying history and pretending that everything was better then and blaming the coalition forces for indirect atrocity while absolving the perpetrators of all responsibility.

 
* Massive political uncertainty leaving the country lawless.
 

Hyperbole

 
* The entire Middle East region now more unstable than before the war began, threatening new regional conflicts.
 

Oh of course you are right. I mean there would definitely be no nuclear arms race between the Hussein crime family and the fanatics in charge of Iran. They are only the most bitter and brutal enemies of the past fifty years after all.  

*shrugs*

The rest of your post is just simply rubbish, intellectually lacking and largely simplistic. It wold be a waste of my time to have this discussion on this forum for the nth time.

Sorry  
 
 
 
Excellent analysis  

Actually no you are completely mistaken. Scroll up a few posts to Lord Hysteria's response and see this particular argument completely debunked.

Even so, if you were correct and a previous generation did install a tyrant (As it has done many times before) Surely that would double our responsibility to remove him?

By preaching non-intervention you are as much an imperialist as anybody else because you wish to carry on the imperialist policies of the cold war and keep those tyrants in power, in effect you wish to fuly support and maintain the status quo. How more conservative can you get?

You talk about reading? Read this:

Excerpt was largely irellevent. Copy and pasting articles from anti-war websites without your own analysis results in an absolutely worthless discussion.

Please explain how the involvement of a previous generation of US officials in aiding Saddam during the Iran/Iraq war should prevent us from liberating the Iraqi people a few decades later.

Until you adress this the entirety of your post is worthless.  

An utter fallacy. If it was about vast natural resources then why did America not do what it always does? In fact what every imperial power has done since the dawn of civlisation: Eliminate the present dictator and install another puppet?

This could be done for an absolute fraction of the cost and lives already spent. It happened in Iran, it happened in latin America it happened all over the world during the era of cold war imperialism.

Tell me if it was about securing resources, stability and profit. Why would the US spend trillions of dollars, thousands of lives and acres of international reputation on establishing a democracy; one of the most unstable forms of government that exists for a great power securing a hegemony.

Once again your arguments are worthless. So is the time you spent searching the internet for the writing of other equally flawed arguments to copy and paste. Think how much time you could have saved without that insecure appeal to authority.  

Oh please, all companies are practically foreign now. Hence the term multinational. What a weak attempt at an argument.

You are comparing events five decades ago to events now. Until you validate this link the comparisons are utterly worthless.

 

I find you extremely patronising to say the least!

"My arguments are worthless. Time spent searching the internet. Copy and pasting arguments. Copying and pasting articles from anti-war websites. Insecure appeal to authority."

Seriously, are you just seeing what you want to see, or are you just trying to bully any opposition to your point of view into submission?

Also, I would appreciate it if you could refrain from stating where I have got my facts from... I have not been on any anti-war websites for any information that I have got nor have I copy and pasted arguments! Quite the opposite, I typed up parts of a book that I deemed necessary in understanding certain aspects of the Iraqi conflict.

Every qoute had footnotes and references of where I got them from... yet all you can say is that it is absolutely worthless. Understanding the very beginning of certain events can go a long way in explaining just who benefits.

So Saddam is put in place by our goverment and armed by our government, therefore we have to get rid of him...Why not ask, why put him there in the first place? Why allow him to get away with murder, but when he becomes harder to control decide to take action?

And why install another puppet when he may renegade like Saddam and deny companies like Halliburton billion dollar contracts from war? So, you really believe the US spent all that money in an effort to establish democracy? The money that was used to fund the war was taken from the taxpayer, this money is then spent on the funding of the Military and this money is also used as aid, this aid is then used in places specified, and the money goes to the contracters within the war who happen to be Western owned. So money goes from the taxpayer to the companies.

Please explain what you consider to be liberation for the Iraqi people?
 
 
  the taliban are the terrorists. a handful of psychos bombed NY city and killed a couple of thousand for revenge. it hasn't happened again to NY.

the US AND WESTERN/ALLIED troops are not terrorists.... they kill thousands of INNOCENT people because it's their job. they get told to do it, sorry ordered to do it.... and not forgetting,,, get paid to KILL.

no these armies are not terrorists.... its their duty to KILL KILL KILL KILL KILL KILL!

i can see some similarities here between the taliban and the allied forces. they are poor and doing what they can to defend. we have everything, but we feel we need to use it against a destroyed nation..... because it needs destroying till it is dust. Saddam killed millions of his own..... we will kill all of the rest!!!!

ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

atleast these guys (taliban) are using Gods religion (Islam) as a device. We're using billions of dollars and pounds from taxpayers money as our means of war.

I choose God over the 'state of freedumb'.... sorry America.

does that make me a terrorist or someone who is willing to stick for his religion rather than jump on the global bandwagon to hunt oil?... sorry... KILL then HUNT.

No, I'm pointing out your lack of ability to formulate your own argument. Copy and pasting things from anti-war websites means that I just encounter a succession of individuals like yourself parroting the same things ceaselessly. What an utter waste of time.

If you want somebody to refute the arguments put forward on an anti-war website go to a pro-war website. This forum is for intellectual discussion between individuals; that is the whole attraction: debating the merits of thousands of different opinions.

Patronising? You would probably be right.

 
I typed up parts of a book that I deemed necessary in understanding certain aspects of the Iraqi conflict.
 

I entered what you quoted into google..... It was copied and pasted. But like I say above, perhaps you could provide your own individual analysis and take on things, rather than somebody elses.

 
Every qoute had footnotes and references of where I got them from... yet all you can say is that it is absolutely worthless. Understanding the very beginning of certain events can go a long way in explaining just who benefits.
 

I say it is absolutely worthless because I have seen and read it all before, my reading does not stop at immature partisan battlelines. Quoting a wall of text at me in the hope it will subdue my rather more succinct argument simply will not work. If you want a proper debate then read it yourself and provide your own interpretation.

You realise that our governments change every so many years? I doubt the leaders of our country all share some collective hive mind. I am pretty sure one individual administration can take a different direction to the last. It's rather worrying you don't know that tbh...

 
And why install another puppet when he may renegade like Saddam and deny companies like Halliburton billion dollar contracts from war?
 

So the alternative for a quasi imperial power is to hand over control the people ? Yes of course it makes so much sense, instead of an absolutist hegemony with a potential for rebellion, lets devolve power tens of millions of times over. If you were to look into the history of the world, I think this would be setting a rather idiotic precedent in over two millenia of imperialism. These tactics were par for the course when it came to huge empires. But you probably don't want to hear that, because your opposition to the invasion was not for any noble value or aim, it was not say, for an end to dictatorship or an end to genocide (It couldn't be, in fact your position would allow this to continue) Nor was it for the people of Iraq. It was simply anti-Americanism, the most shallow, intellectualy bereft and tragically popular position in the western world.

I detest what Iraq is now. However bad it is as another place for the west to export exploitation, it is far better for the Iraqi people than what existed before. As for how Iraq is better now. If you need an answer on that then you have obviously never read about the regime, or indeed the history of Baathist Iraq. Thats what happens when everything you know about something comes from slanted corners of the internet rather than some form of respectable academic study.

I have given you my argument but you still see what you want to see... I have mentioned why I believe that the the governments have decided to invade countries, and I have explained in plain English that companies that are Western owned benefit from this occupation more so then the everyday Iraqi on the ground.

Yet again, you choose to belittle people rather than truly focus on what has been said in the post...

And again, can you refrain from insinuating that I have no knowledge of an event because apparently I copy and paste things? The book from which I have qouted from is called 'The New Rulers of The World' by John Pilger, which I have read many times over and typed in whilst going through the book, so for the love of God, stop trying to bully me with b*******! Are you hoping that if you huff and you puff, that my argument will be blown down?

The qoutes that I have given quite frankly speaks volumes of it's own. Have you ever looked at them, then asked yourself why such an interest is taken in countries rich in natural resources? I gather you have not.

You can keep saying "Liberty for the Iraqi people brought by the West!" until your blue in the face. The fact is, you have not provided one single shred of evidence that this is the case, and who best to decide this is the case other then those who have first hand experience in these issues. Therefore, I have qouted people who can give an insight into the plight by the Iraqi people (and Afghanistan if you want) and have based my judgement on that. I do not take a slanted look at any event and I have come to the conclusion that what I believe now is right as opposed to the opposite view I have read before. It is your aim to convince me otherwise, but as of yet any substance to your claims are lacking.

What exactly is this "respectable academic study" that has you so convinced? Don't bother asking me to look for it because I want to know exactly what you have read that has made you think the way you do... And I will most definitely buy/borrow these books, because you know what? I would like to see the invasion of Iraq/Afghanistan and every other country with Western backed governments as genuine attempts to liberate people, rather than the frighting prospect that these governments only serve the interests of those with contracts with said country only to profit from their natural resources and from the money quite frankly stolen from the taxpayer...
 
 
War does not determine who is right, only who is left. I do not think there is a "Good guy" and "Bad guy", I think there are people with interests, and they will call those who stop their interests from being fulfilled "Evil" and others "Good". Get real everyone, Saddam, the USA, the Taliban, the UK.....they have all done some F'ed up things in the past and present. And they consider these things to be worth the price paying for their own greater "good".

Hi. Thanks for announcing to everyone that you are the bigger idiot, a shallow one at that, that you have to comment on superficial imperfections rather than the actual content. Tch tch... shallow mind indeed.

You sound like the bigots. Is that BIGGER than an IDIOT? lol.... (forgive me for the choice of upper or lowercase English... for I am retarded)...

It is purely superficial, as I suggested, due to the fact that one feels the need to express him/herself in a way that inspires emphasis, and dare I say it, creativity.

You clearly are not of the artistic breed? Mmmm... Thought not.

What my point was that we are all terrorists if we choose to solve problems by violence and killing in this world. The muslims are fighting back because their countries are being invaded by evidently stronger militia, for whatever reason, terrorism revenge, oil, control, cheese, baked beans.... Whatever! But we are infact putting our country more at risk from these terrorists by contuining our bloodshedding campaign. We had done the job, albeit not the right thing to do in the first place, but it happened then Saddam died, no weapons found so that's it. Call it a night. Get out of there. But no. We have to hang around pissing off more international radicals (which by the way exist in every corner of the globe, not just within the muslim community internationally - i.e Columbine shootings, the IRA, Russian soldier pilaging many former soviet states till today etc. Its all terrorism, we're just ganging up on the muslims right now).

TERRORIST: a group or individual party that inflict terror by means of psychological, physical and spiritual harm.

Search for information....not bullsh#t on the CIA. They have started 80% of the wars in the world today.... they have actively started... yes.... where are they now.... starting another war. This time, its with the muslims...... tch tch tch. Its the Freemasons VS God's Masons!

What's even more slutty of the CIA is that they planned all this 30 years ago. They were just waiting for the day the muslims fell in to the trap.

The US army are responsible for the destrcution of civilisation as we know it. It is their ULTIMATE GOAL TO SCARE CIVILIANS.....

Search for information....not bullsh#t on the CIA. They have started 80% of the wars in the world today.... they have actively started... yes.... where are they now.... starting another war. This time, its with the muslims...... tch tch tch. Its the Freemasons VS God's Masons!

What's even more slutty of the CIA is that they planned all this 30 years ago. They were just waiting for the day the muslims fell in to the trap.

The US army are responsible for the destrcution of civilisation as we know it. It is their ULTIMATE GOAL TO SCARE CIVILIANS.....
