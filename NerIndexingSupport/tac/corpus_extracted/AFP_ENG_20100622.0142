Israel on Tuesday launched a spy satellite from a base in the southern of the
country, the defence ministry said, with the device reportedly capable of
monitoring arch-foe Iran.

"A few minutes ago the State of Israel launched the Ofek 9 satellite from the
Palmachim base," the ministry said. "The results of the launch are being
examined by the technical team."

It gave no details on the satellite, but public radio said it, like its
predecessors in the Ofek series, were cable of taking high resolution pictures
and aimed at monitoring Iran's nuclear programme.
