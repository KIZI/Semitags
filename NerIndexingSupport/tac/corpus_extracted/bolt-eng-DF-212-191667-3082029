 
 
Europe and why it doesn't care about America
 
 
The US and Europe are two very different societies. (With the exception of New York and Boston maybe - in my opinion I'm sure others could name other places in the US).

Comparing the two is a waste of time - Europe is simply too diverse, and the US is too big.

Personally, I think it is quite amusing seeing all the stuff that comes out from the US about Europe and it's problems. All of it comes from neocon sources (read the right wing of the Republican Party).

They are basically knocking Europe not because they care about Europe, but because of something else entirely. Their target is much closer to home, and it is the 'new deal' legislation in America, which they want to dismantle.

Why knock Europe? Because it is the living embodiment of the 'new deal' values - social security, provision for all, redistributive taxation and a society that takes care of the weakest members of society. Of course, whether these ideals are met in Europe we can all argue about forever. But the point is it is an alternative to what the neocons want, and they need to discredit it. They do this by feeding this nonsense into media networks such as Fox News in America, and it looks like a lot of people there are unquestioningly lapping it up.

So, as a European, I don't really care about all of this flaming coming from across the Atlantic - it doesn't affect me, and I don't want to live in a society like the US. I know that all of the invective aimed at us is really only the US feeding on itself, in its self destruction of its self.

Europe is not the disunited one - we don't really have a problem with ourselves, because we already have firm national identities. We simply don't really care much what is coming out of the next state - we know who we are and what we are about.

Contrast that with the US, that has split now along Civil War lines, if you look of the map of the last election. America is tearing itself apart, and the rich have taken control of the ship (they always had control in the 20th century, just not so overtly). When America is divided, they look abroad for scapegoats, whether they are 'appeasers' from 'Old Europe', or muslims or whoever looks slightly foreign or alien. The spirit of the original Puritans is alive and well in America - 400 years later - which I find amusing as that stuff was medieval.

It brings a wry smile to my face when Americans throw brickbats at Europe. You know for sure they are deeply uneasy at themselves, because they have a neighbour that by its very presence throws into doubt a lot of their assumptions on how a society should be. All they can do is impotently criticise Europe, because it represents an alternative that the rich who run America do not want.

All of this is a side issue of course to the real issues that face America for the 21st century, and those are really sitting in South and East Asia. If this administration in the White House really cared about America, it would be paying much closer attention to its relations with the emerging powers there. Instead, what America gets it lots of criticism of Europe becase certain people in the White House want to fix the American tax system so that their friends can become even richer than they already are.

Europeans aren't the worried ones, oh no - it's the American public.
 
 
So we are the ones that are "worried," although YOU are the one that came all the way here to tell us that? Feel better now?  
 
 
'Nother friggin' moonbatty Euro-chimp. Great. Just what the WAB needed.  
 
 
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha hahahahahahahahahahaha

wait
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha hahahahahahahahahahaha
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha hahahahahahahahahahaha

okay done

You write this in total ignorance as if Americans really give a **** about Europe, from this i imagine you're sitting there thinking, that we sit around the water cooler at work on our breaks going, "Yup, I hate Europe." When nothing could be further from the truth. We don't give a **** about you on the level you care about our affairs. Get bent, dude. It's you who have this obesssion with us. Us, for example, if Tony Blair loses, we wouldn't even blink. You, George W won re-election, you acted as if you were preparing for a soccer riot.
 
 
Who's tony blair?  
 
 
 
Who's tony blair?  

 

Just looked him on a BBC Biography.

He's Prime Minister representing the Labour Party that relies too much on spin.   He won the title after the death of John Smith, when his main potential rival Gordon Brown agreed not to stand in return for the chancellorship.

Got the position by default I guess.  

Oh, here's a link.  http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2164337.stm 
 
 
Wait a minute.

I thought that the UK was the 51st US state. Wouldn't that make this Blair character the governer of the most repressive state in the Union?

No?

LOL....

For another example: We don't create long winded threads about how we don't care what Europe thinks. He creates a long winded thread about how Europe doesn't care what America thinks.
 
 
 
Wait a minute.

LOL....  

 

  A quote from Tony Blair: ""A Conservative government would put this all at risk."   Put "all what" at risk? Public services spending?  
 
 
I could give a rat's ass what Europe thinks of the Legend.
 
 
In case you have not noticed, Tony Blair took a lot of heat, both personal and political, when he allied himself with Bush and sent troops in Iraq. While other countries have balked and /or pulled out, there are still british troops in Iraq. You really should find another target to pick on. There are several others.

Read prior posts: WE WERE BEING SARCASTIC.   We are fully aware who Blair is, and his achievements. Matter of fact, I would go so far as to say Blair is about the only thing Europe has going for them at present.

Now I know why they call you "bonehead."  
 
 
We are fighting for the inalienable right of human kind, black or white, Christian or not, left, right or merely indifferent, to be free. Free to raise a family in love and hope. Free to earn a living and be rewarded by your own efforts. Free not to bend your knee to any man in fear. Free to be you so long as being you does not impair the freedom of others. That's what we're fighting for. And that's a battle worth fighting. -PM Tony Blair
 
 
Well, I would like to respond but I will probobly sound redundent after what the others have said.

If you think that Americans care what Europe thinks then I would recomend a good doctor. Americans ignore Europe(UK excluded) totaly and yet you come up with this notion that we have some vested interest in Europe. Europe is ignored and is having a hissyfit about it.

And what is this about national unity in Europe? Europe is torn in so many directions....

Your economy is dying, socialism is failing, your "military" has no projection power, and your people are discontented with their lives. You are a continent of fallen Empires and past Superpowers that no one really cares about and are in a perpetual state of blubbering about it.

Get over it.
 
 
Ditto on what VVV said.

Benno, you don't know the first thing about America. You're just feeling sorry for yourself because most of your politicians have shown their impotence to the world. Not all Europeans are weenies. There is a very small minority of you that still have a spine. Unfortunately for them, they are carrying the burden for all of you.

Here's your divided America:

 
 
 
I don't know why you are fighting.

 
I could give a rat's ass what Europe thinks of the Legend.

That monologue (the original post) has to be the biggest bunch of BS that I've read on this board. You have an arrogant European continent whose road to freedom was paved by the blood of American soldiers and trillions of dollars in subsequent defense/rebuilding expenditures--and is now looking down its nose at America.

The examples provided of Europe's social justice, while railing against American wealth, is the reason their fat had to be pulled out of the fire by us. Countries whose barbaric histories sowed misery upon untold millions now see fit to criticize those unique things about America that have allowed it to achieve and prosper.

Yes, we may be a country that is becoming increasingly divided. But the divisions in Europe are far more pronounced--being masked only by their unified contempt for a nation that sacrificed so much for them. Their fat, dumb, and happy ideal about life makes me ill. Such is the mindset of those who wield an air of superiority in an attempt to bury a deep-seeded feeling of inferiority.

It is with deep regret that we have anything in common with them.
 
 
Roge.... you lose.
 
 
 
Roge.... you lose.

 

RogerDunno should be regarded exactly as much as any other irritating but ultimately irrelevant poster we've ever had in here. Which is to say, not at all.

Now, he may wish to re-engage, and I hope he does. We don't want group-think here, and voices that depart from the majority of opinion are to be sought and welcomed, otherwise our 'debate' over this or that subject becomes a seminar on how clever we all are.

But if he comes back with his prejudices and opinions that are based on nothing as substansive as even a dam' good rumor, or if he wants to start in with the, 'You know what's wrong with you people?' tack again, then we should give him the cyber-quivalent of the 'Atomic Elbow Drop From the Top Rope' treatment again.  
 
 
I've posted this here and on another forum before. I like it and I think it fits here after Roger's rant, if I do say so myself.

"Annoyance, mistrust, scorn, derision, weariness. The above-average level that America receives is of course partly due to simply being a taller lightning rod - we're bigger, stronger, faster in many ways and we are also quite penetrative, like socio-cultural Liquid Wrench.

I think the rest of it is simple resentment; "Short Man" Syndrome sporting a Trojan Magnum condom. And it is understandable to a degree. We sort of stumbled into the Royal Flush of nation-state concepts and have managed to keep it going for a small while with relatively few hiccups. This makes some people angry. Some people want to be as successful as the U.S. without either the means or the effort. They can't, and they resent that we have what they cannot.

Also, some people want their own way of doing things to be correct - I'm sure die-hard Marxists want true Communism to work. It hasn't yet and here's the old US of A pooping along doing great, waving happily as we pull away. Likewise monarchists, collectivists, socialists, and tribalists all want good standards of living and stable, happy, wealthy populations, but most just can't crack it, and there we go again, waving happily as we pull away.

Lastly, I think some folks just fear power they feel they can't control. America has an economy that on its bad days can still counter the rest of the planet put together. We have a military that, when used properly, is the proverbial "Finger of God". We've lost more Mars probes and space shuttles than anyone else has ever built, and we stopped walking on the face of the Moon because we were too busy to find a reason to stay. Plus, we have five separate brands of caramel-coated popcorn snacks.

Maybe I wouldn't trust us completely either."

Interesting.

When I fired off that post, I had no idea that it would such a panicked reaction from some of the posters on this forum.

I knew Amercans were insecure, but I had no idea by how much.

The point of my argument is that Europe really isn't too concerned with America, and that the criticism coming from America of Europe was plitically motivated by the neo-cons domestic agenda.

To get back the responses that we have, has proved beyong my wildest dreams what I have believed to be true.

Namely, that it isn't Europeans that neo-cons hate, it is really the America created in the New Deal era of 1938 - 1980. Every negative posting here has confirmed that - namely, the glorification of the American military, the denigration of other countries and the slip into isolationism, the retreat into nationalism and xenophobia and the end of the states involvement in Social Welfare.

When you say to somebody 'I am not really interested in you' and they fly into fury like this, instead of shrugging, you know there are a lot of underlying issues. Namely envy for one. I notice nobody came back with my chief assertion about the death of New Deal America, probably because they know it is all too true. The only response seemed to be 'look at our Aircraft Carriers'. The difference I was pointing out was that Europe has made a choice to keep social issues at the top of the agenda, rather than taking the direction the US has done.

I would even go as far as saying perhaps the US is slipping into some nationalistic - fascist state, where social issues are rubbed off the agenda, and military conquest and nationalism are glorified. I know some of you will immediately think of Adolf and Germany, but I was referring more to say, Italy in the '30's, or some such other nationalistic - right wing state.

What I am disappointed to not have received was any balanced counter argument. All I get from Americans seems to be 'we have the biggest army and aircraft carriers'. IS this all that Americans can point to themselves and say they are proud of?

After all, the true measure of a society is how it treats its weakest members, not its military.
 
 
LOL, every once in a while i have to give Lucien a RIGHT ON BROTHER!  
 
 
@RogerBenno --- I tell you what I can point to -----> FREEDOM !!!! My forefathers came to America to escape the tyranny of European rule, first & foremost, escaping the Pope! I have the freedom of religion & freedom from religion. If it takes an aircraft carrier to keep, that's fine by me.

Where do you stand on Social Spending etc. as I mentioned in the original post?

Escaping the Pope? Did he owe the Holy Father some money? Why was he being chased by such a frail old man?  

But really, do you only define America in terms of weapons and religion?
 
 
"I don't think so"

LOL, delusion is a wonderful thing for the weak.  

I think socail spending is socailism. My views of socailism are very well known here.

Jesus Christ, you do not understand us AT ALL. Most Americans think the government is too big and social spending needs to be cut or eliminated. People here believe in WORKING FOR A LIVING, not having the government hand everything to you by stealing from others (taxation).
 
 
 
When you say to somebody 'I am not really interested in you' and they fly into fury like this

 

Haha, this comming for the genus who creates a topic about how he doesn't carea about America. Keep shooting yourself in the foot... the rest of us are getting a kick out of it.

Listening to propaganda loudspeakers while on crack doesn't make for agood mental state. I'm worry for you dear. And what is this about social issues being rubbed off the aganda(they should be but they arn't). You obviously have no understanding of American politics.

 
Namely envy for one.
 

Ok... you caught me. I have a confession to make. I'm Envious of everything about Europe.... Boy if only we were like Europe. I mean don't we all want pathetic underfunded militaries, tanked economies, skyrocketing unemployment, taxes ad nausium, false superiority complexes, a failing socialist system, unhappy populaces, and a big brother taking care of us?

PS. That was sarcasm in case you can't figure it out.

 
After all, the true measure of a society is how it treats its weakest members, not its military
 

Alexander the Great, the Roman Emperors, and almost any other notable person that we read about in history books would disagree.

And anyway, in our system, the weaker members have the same oppertunity as anyone else. (Mentaly unstable and handicapped people excepted...they are cared for by government and private charities).

 
All I get from Americans seems to be 'we have the biggest army and aircraft carriers'. IS this all that Americans can point to themselves and say they are proud of?
 

I'm proud of everything about being an American, and I'm damn proud of our military, and every soldier in it. I would go into things like loyality, honor, and sacrifice but its a concepts most Europeans can't grasp.

Aha - now we get at it.

If you don't have any money, then you are stealing from others. This is precidely the difference between the US and Europe, and why Europeans aren't that interested in US society as an alternative.

Taxation as theft - a prime difference. In Europe, taxation is seen as neccessary.

Thats how socialism works. The government never tells you that you can get better heath care and earn more money if you fended for yourself. They set you up so that you feel like you have to rely on big brother to do things for you...

Main Difference between europe and American

America: We will preserve the freedom that brave Americans have faught and died for at any cost.

Europe: We will trade the freedom that brave Americans have faught and died for, for secutiry.
 
 
 
Haha, this comming for the genus who creates a topic about how he doesn't carea about America. Keep shooting yourself in the foot... the rest of us are getting a kick out of it.

 

No, really I don't care for George W's America. Can I make it any clearer to you?

Jesus, I know you are proud to be American - you don't have to tell me that.

I just think you are very insecure about your country, and what it means to be an American.
 
 
If you don't have any money and you get it from others against their will (and since when has taxation been optional?) then it is stealing. This is my mentality and the mentality of most of the Americans on this forum (I think). I believe a limited amount of taxation is necessary, but not nearly as much as you. I used to be a leftist like you but now I've seen how full of logical fallacies socialism is.
 
 
Wow roger... your answers to all of my points were rubish... rubish... rubish. Not a very substantial argument now is it.

 
I just think you are very insecure too.

no i am not going to bash europe now. but there is so much going wrong on this continent, that i think we are not in the position to criticize america, americans and the american lifestyle.

i am really so sick of so many europeans througout the internet going to play the moral elite of the universe and have amerika as their target 24 hours a day.

and even if there are some true points (maybe) in rogers posts - so what ? why doing this? focus your anger on brussels there is plenty of work to do.

just to make sure:
i like every single country in europe, their cultures, lifestyles etc. and we would do a great job by forming a trade union as it started, but the big black hole brussels (sorry belgians this has nothing to do with you) is the beginning of the end in the nearby future i think. maybe i`m to negative but i fear it will colapse.

editied for corrections ( i fear there are millions left sorry)
 
 
Chaps,

That's not fair.

And you are all ganging up on the poor joe.

And imagine there is a chap who is 'hugging and kissing' him. Obvioulsy, he had to go. Many men don't appreciate being kissed by a man.

And imagine hugging and kissing and then slipping in a BIbible in his overcoat pocket!    

OK, what's wrong with Europe?

Bichler,

Confed likes Amsterdam and maybe the big black hole Brussels. You don't like Brussels Sprouts?
 
 
 
How does the pope work into all this??? I think your just trying to beat somemore anti-catholic rhetoric into our heads.
 

VVV,

That's again not fair.

He did not speak of the Pope.

It is our In House Preacher who stated that his folks bolted out of Europe to escape the Pope.

Roger wanted to know if the Preacher's folks bolted because they took off with the Pope's money.

It is also a wonder how this Preacher has been running from pillar to post and what was his folks doing in Europe (connect being inflamed by Bluesman's post).
 
 
Apart from the jingoism, the debate was most interesting and educative.

To keep it going, here goes.

 
"The U.S. and Europe, 1945 to Today"

Since 1945, a primary objective of U.S. foreign policy has been to keep western Europe as a subordinated, highly integrated part of its geopolitical strategic resources. This was easy to achieve in the aftermath of the Second World War, when Europe was economically exhausted from the effects of the war, and when a majority of its populations, and even more of the political and economic elite, were fearful of Communist forces, both because of Soviet military power and because of the popular strength of western European Communist parties. The U.S. program took the form of Marshall Plan economic assistance for European recovery and the creation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

It is within this context that the moves to create European institutions took place. At first, these efforts were limited to six countries - France, West Germany, Italy, and the three Benelux countries - and involved limited economic arrangements. There were also early efforts to create European military structures, which were not successful. The movement in this direction was strongly supported by European Christian-Democratic parties, but also by Social-Democratic parties. They were strongly opposed by the Communist parties in these countries, who saw these structures as part of the Cold War. From a U.S. point of view, European structures seemed desirable, both because they strengthened European economies (and therefore made them better customers for U.S. exports and investments), and because they seemed to be a way of allaying French fears about German military rearmament and integration into NATO.

By the 1960's, two elements in the equation began to change from the U.S. point of view. First, Western Europe was becoming too strong. It was emerging as an economic peer of the U.S. and therefore as a potential serious competitor in the world-economy. Secondly, Charles de Gaulle came to power once again in France. And De Gaulle wanted to have European structures that would be politically autonomous, that is, not subordinate segments of U.S. geopolitical strategic resources. At this point, U.S. enthusiasm about European unity began to cool. But the U.S. found itself politically unable to state this openly. There were further shifts in the situation. The Communist parties of Western Europe grew weaker electorally. And their politics began to change in the direction of what was then called Eurocommunism. One of the consequences was a shift in the position of these parties about European structures, which they began cautiously to support, or at least tolerate.
This was the period in which the U.S. was losing the war in Vietnam, which took a serious toll on the U.S. geopolitical position. The combination of this political-military setback, combined with the emergence of Western Europe and Japan as major economic competitors, meant the end of unquestioned U.S. hegemony in the world-system and the beginning of a slow decline. It required a major shift in U.S. foreign policy from the simple outright dominance of the earlier period. The shift started with Nixon - détente with the Soviet Union, and more importantly the trip to Beijing and the transformation of U.S.-China relations. Nixon initiated the policy of what I call soft multilateralism," a policy that would be pursued by every successive U.S. president from Nixon to Clinton, including Reagan and George H.W. Bush.

In terms of Europe, the main consideration was how to slow down what seemed to be a growing trend towards European political autonomy. To do this, the U.S. offered Europe geopolitical "partnership" (that is, a degree of political consultation) on two fronts - the continuing Cold War with the Soviet Union, and the political-economic struggles of the North versus the South. This was supposed to be implemented by a multitude of institutions - among others, the Trilateral Commission, the meetings of the G-7, and the World Economic Forum at Davos. The program on the Cold War resulted in the Helsinki agreements. The North-South program resulted in the drive against nuclear proliferation, the Washington Consensus (in favor of neo-liberalism, against developmentalism), and the construction of the World Trade Organization.

In the 1970s and 1980s, one could say that the adjusted U.S. foreign policy was partially successful. Although Europe's political autonomy increased - remember German's Ostpolitik and the gazoduc linking the Soviet Union and Western Europe - by and large Europe did not wander very far from the U.S. geopolitically. In particular, attempts to create a European army were effectively blocked by continuing opposition by the United States. In practice, although not in words, the U.S. had become hostile to European unity.

U.S. policy seemed even more successful on the North-South front. Most Third World countries fell in line with the IMF's structural adjustment policies, and even the socialist countries of east-central Europe moved in this direction. Popular disillusion with the national liberation movements in power and with the Communist regimes in the socialist bloc muted any remaining militancy and created a sense of morose pessimism among the world left. And of course, the final "triumph" was the collapse of the U.S.S.R.

But this "triumph" did not at all serve U.S. foreign policy interests, least of all in western Europe. For it removed the last major argument as to why western Europe should accept a subordination to U.S. geopolitical "leadership" around the world. Saddam Hussein seized the moment to pose an overt challenge to the U.S., something he would never have been able to do in the previous Cold War days. The Gulf War ended in a truce at the line of departure, which, as the decade went on, seemed less and less acceptable to the U.S. Clinton nonetheless pursued the Nixon policy of "soft multilateralism" in the Balkans, the Middle East, and East Asia, and the west Europeans still declined to break openly with the U.S. on any major issue. Meanwhile, to ensure that western Europe would stay in line, the U.S. pushed hard for the incorporation into European institutions (and NATO) of the now non-Communist east and central European states, feeling that these states would be eager to maintain and reinforce ties with the U.S. and would thus counterbalance the emerging autonomist sentiments in western Europe.

Enter George W. Bush and the hawks. They viewed the Nixon-to-Clinton foreign policy as incredibly weak and a major contribution to the continuing decline of U.S. power in the world. They were particularly disdainful of any reliance on United Nations structures and especially anxious to contain Europe's aspirations to political autonomy. In their view, the way to do this was to assert U.S. power unilaterally, and militarily, in a blatantly forceful way. Their target of choice, well announced beforehand during the 1990s, was Iraq, for three reasons: The Gulf War had been "humiliating" for the U.S. in that Saddam Hussein survived; Iraq would be an excellent site for permanent U.S. bases in the Middle East; Iraq was an easy target, militarily, precisely because it did not have weapons of mass destruction.
The theory of the hawks was that the conquest of Iraq would demonstrate the unbeatable military superiority of the United States, and would therefore have three effects: It would intimidate the western Europeans (and secondarily the East Asians) and end all aspirations for political autonomy. It would intimidate all aspiring nuclear powers and induce them to abandon any pretensions to obtaining such weapons. It would intimidate all Middle Eastern states, and induce them to end all aspirations for self-assertion geopolitically as well as get them to accept a settlement of the Israel/Palestine issue on terms acceptable to Israel and the United States.

This policy has been a complete fiasco. The seemingly easy target of Iraq has turned out not to be such an easy target. At the moment, the U.S. occupation is facing resistance and an ever-growing uprising which will minimally end with an Iraqi government not at all to the taste of the U.S. and maximally with a total withdrawal of U.S. forces, as happened in Vietnam. The attempt to split Europe into two camps - the so-called "old Europe" and "new Europe" - had momentary success. But with the Spanish elections, the tide has turned entirely, and Europe is on the verge of establishing its geopolitical autonomy for the first time since 1945. Nuclear proliferation has not been slowed down. If anything, it has been speeded up. And Middle Eastern states are pulling away from, not edging towards, the United States (with the exception of Libya, a policy that may not last). And Israel/Palestine is in total deadlock, which will persist until it explodes in a way that cannot be contained.

The macho unilateralism of the hawks has failed, and support for such a policy within the United States has declined considerably, even among Republican conservatives. However, what is the alternative? What the Republican moderates, and even more the centrist Democrats, led by John F. Kerry, offer in its place is a return to the "soft multilateralism" of the Nixon-to-Clinton years. Can this work now? It is very doubtful. It is almost certain that, in the next decade, the siren of nuclear armament will attract a dozen states at least, and that we shall be going from eight to twenty-five nuclear powers in the next quarter century. This provides a real constraint on U.S. military power. There seems no likelihood that Middle Eastern realities will move in any direction the U.S. will like. This is particularly true of Israel/Palestine.

What of Europe? Europe is the big question mark of world geopolitics at the moment. Even the most "Atlanticist" of Europeans has become wary of the U.S. government, and even of a "multilateralist" U.S. But Europe still shares one interest with the United States - the North-South struggle. The adoption of a serious European constitution is still in doubt, especially since a single negative vote on a referendum in any one country can undo any agreement. And in particular, the European left is not yet cured of its post-1945 doubts about European unity, and is therefore not yet ready to throw itself wholeheartedly into European construction. This is particularly true in the Nordic countries and in France, but there are some similar reserves almost everywhere.

A strong autonomous Europe is a first, and essential, building block of a multipolar world. An autonomous Europe that would be willing to work towards a fundamental restructuring of the world-economy in directions that would actually start to overcome the continuing North-South polarization would constitute an even greater change on the world scene. Both are eminently possible. Neither is at all certain.
