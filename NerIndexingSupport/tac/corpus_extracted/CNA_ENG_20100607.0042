A Malaysian business tycoon with Kinmen roots returned to that former frontline
island Monday to pay his respect to his late ancestors.

Tan Seng Leong, founder of Malaysian property developer and hotel operator BCB
Berhad, was warmly welcomed by members of his clan at Bishan with firecrackers
and bouquets.

He and his family members, who accompanied him on the trip, then visiting the
shrine of the Chen clan to honor their ancestors.

Tan, who is a member of the clan's 22nd generation, said his grandfather
emigrated from Bishan to Malaysia in the early 20th century to seek a better
life.

Noting that his grandfather was just one of many Kinmen people who emigrated to
Southeast Asia during the era, Tang said Kinmen immigrants weaned on infertile
land and hardship in their homeland often worked harder than others in their new
countries and thereby created distinguished new careers.

Tan was born to a family with 11 members in 1956 in Johor, Malaysia. His father
eked out a living by fishing, but he was able to turn his real estate business
into one of his country's most prominent firms.

His rags-to-riches story is considered an example for ambitious entrepreneurs in
Malaysia.

The business tycoon has granted the Kinmen National  Park Headquarters's request
to share his success in Malaysia with local people in a documentary film
featuring well-known overseas Chinese originating from the island.

He said it would be his honor if his story could inspire anyone from the
homeland of his clan to work hard in pursuit of success.
