The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) filed a misfeasance suit against 12
members of the Referendum Screening Committee Thursday in protest against their
rejection of the latest referendum initiative by the party.

The case was lodged in the Taipei District Prosecutors Office by TSU Secretary-
General Lin Jih-jia.

In a written statement, TSU Chairman Huang Kun-huei accused the committee
members of damaging Taiwan's democratic system by turning down the initiative --
on the strength of personal views -- which was endorsed by more than 109,000
citizens.

Huang urged the committee to reconsider its decision "so as not to disgrace
Taiwan's democracy."

The question in the TSU referendum initiative asked: "Do you agree that the
government should sign an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with
China? " On June 3, it was voted down 12-4 by the committee, on grounds that it
did not conform to the law.

Nonetheless, the TSU on Wednesday started the second phase of its signature
drive for the ECFA referendum proposal. It also launched a new petition for a
referendum on whether the Referendum Screening Committee should be abolished.

Commenting on the TSU's latest move, ruling Kuomintang Legislator Wu Yu-sheng
said the pro-independence party should respect the committee's ruling and "stop
making trouble."
