 
 
A proposal that would end Islamic terrorism
 
 
First of all, this is purely hypothetical, so nobody need get upset.

Our governments (in the West) will make it very clear that every time a terrorist attack takes place in a Western country in the name of Islam, we will destroy a place of religious importance in Mecca - (a Mosque, a museum etc. etc.). Warnings will of course be given in advance to avoid any casualties. There's no way a Muslim would carry out an attack if he is aware that in doing so he will indirectly be destroying 'holy' buildings in Mecca - Islamic terrorism will become a thing of the past.

To oppose this idea means that you are saying bricks and mortar are worth more than human lives.
 
 
Surely this will just make things worse? And encourage more Islamic terror.

To be honest I am actually sickened that anyone would suggest such a thing.

I don't think a Muslim would commit an act for which he knows will result in the destruction of a Mosque in Mecca.
 
 
What about the IRA? gonna bomb a church?
And not every bloody muslim is a terrorist, its completely unfair and ridiculous suggestion. I won't go blow up the Vatican every time one dodgy priest gets hold of a choir boy!!!
What kind of troll are you?! 0/10.

Tit for tat exchanges will not work. I should not have to explain this to an Israeli. They of all people should understand this. Sadly the opposite seems to be the case.
 
 
This wouldn't work at all.

Quick question, off topic... how come every topic I go onto you're always the first person to reply...  
 
 
A quick look at your sig and it is clear why no one should take you seriously.
 
 
I'm not even muslim and I know you are a ****.
 
 
Do you actually believe this will work? I mean really; as in if it was put to a referendum you'd vote in favour of it.
 
 
 
This wouldn't work at all.

Two wrongs do not make a right!
 
 
If they read this...you are soooo dead!!!!!
 
 
youre a really bad troll, think im gonna return to H&R now.....dissapoint!
 
 
Jesus Christ that's the worst ****ing idea ever. How about you say for every time they commit a terrorist act, we'll install an army base in a Middle Eastern country. That'll deter them...
 
 
Can I slap a Jew every time the interest rate goes up?
 
 
what happens when you run out of mecca?

Why are you so obsessed with muslims?

You are such an idiotic human being that I'm afraid no word or even phrase will truly convey your low level of intelligence and lack of respect for other human beings. What a horrible person you are.
 
 
 
To oppose this idea means that you are saying bricks and mortar are worth more than human lives.

 

No, we are saying that you can't respond to terrorism but threatening more terrorism against them, that would be stooping to their level. Many terrorists would use it as proof that their terrorism is justified.
This could lead to war against all Muslim countries.
What about innocent people that would be inevitably killed in an attack.
What about the millions of Muslims to whom their holy buildings are very important but who are not terrorists and would never agree with terrorism. Just because a few extremists do bad things does not mean all Muslims should be punished.
Many Muslims would fight back against this, some by joining with the terrorists.
The buildings are to commemorate the spots, it is the location that is holy not the building in some cases, and the buildings have been knocked down or damaged before and then simply rebuilt.

This is like saying a murderer's house where all his family live should be burnt down, even though his family may be completely innocent.

Basically, worst idea ever.
 
 
 
I don't think a Muslim would commit an act for which he knows will result in the destruction of a Mosque in Mecca.

 

In Islam, the blood of on Muslim is more valuable then all the holy buildings you can destroy. If this threat would have any effect at all, there would be no wars Iraq, Afghanistan, Palestine and countless of other places.
 
 
A man in America threatened to burn a Koran, there was international uproar and when he carried it out a mob went and killed UN staff.

Imagine threatening to blow up Mecca, the very idea of it would be an international disaster, think of all the countries who are going to become extremely hostile to us, I would envision Islamic countries threatening war or would bomb us in return.
 
 
Never heard of such a thing as taking the moral high ground and being the bigger man?
 
 
Then you get the white supremists blowing **** up in the name of Islam...flawed theory...
 
 
 
Can I slap a Jew every time the interest rate goes up?

 

 

Why must you resort to anti-Semitism? You and the posters who repped you should be ashamed.

 
 

 

Find racist jokes funny, do you?
 
 
This is a hilarious proposal by the way but I think this is a stupid idea.
You clearly haven't considered the actual Muslims who end up getting their Mosques blown up.
Says a lot about the OP's perception of Islam though........interesting. Do some westerners also genuinely think it's Islam vs the West?

No, to oppose this idea is to say that attacking an entire religion because of a small minority of extremists is wrong.

Not only that, and even if I thought that was not a heinous thing to do, it would just cause far more trouble than it would solve. It would just rally 2 billion of the World's Muslim's together (and probably not do us any favours with Russia and China) against us. We have now gone from a small minority who irrationally hate us, to an overwhelming majority who have understandable reason to call for blood.

Oh my, some Christians EDL members beat up an Ethnic immigrant! Bomb the Vatican! Bulldoze Westminster Abbey!

I am generally a fairly hard-line, conservative individual. But you are just a nut-case. Christ, please never go into politics. The last thing we need is an all-out holy war...

I take it you didn't like my idea? Wonder why...

Oh Its another zionist   declaring his radical ideology  

Nothing to see people. Please move along.
 
 
that's a great idea, punish everyone for the actions of the few!

This would never work because the Jews would just bomb western targets and blame the Muslims like they did on 9/11.

In fact, according to ex British foreign secretary Robin Cook, Al Qaeda does not exist and never has done. All the bombings carried out by so called ''Muslim Extremists'' were actually carried out by Jews.

Here is what Robin Cook had to say, 2 weeks before he died in mysterious circumstances:

 
''The truth is, there is no Islamic army or terrorist group called Al Qaeda. And any informed intelligence officer knows this. But there is a propaganda campaign to make the public believe in the presence of an identified entity representing the devil only in order to drive the TV watcher to accept a unified international leadership for a war against terrorism. The countries behind this propaganda is the US and Israel''.

Or we could just all convert to Islam and live together as one big happy family? Problem solved. I was being sarcastic by the way.

Oh and another thing are you always this diplomatic and non-atagonistic in your way of thinking? And you do realise that these Islamic terrorist who by principles of faith and religion are not really Muslims at all by way of their sinful actions, you do realise they are just a small minority of approximately 1 billion plus muslims? Why would you condone the destruction of a religious site and inflicting emotional suffering on them when your argument is with a small group?
 
 
 
that's a great idea, punish everyone for the actions of the few!

 

Who is being punished?

I think any reasonable person would prefer a building to be destroyed over a human life being destroyed. Everyone wins...except terrorism.

The IRA are a republican terrorist group concerned with reclaiming Northern Ireland from the British, not reinstalling Catholicism. They don't perpetrate in the name of God. Your comment is stupid.

Coming from a staunch Zionist like yourself, I'm actually not surprised with this.

Collective punishment of a whole people is what you guys do best. It's really disgusting that people would view the world with such warped paradigms.

no, because the islamic terrorists do not represent the muslim community. why bomb buildings in mecca to punish people there and muslims all over the ?world for the sins of the deluded few? and who said that this threat would even work
 
 
 
Oh my, some Christians EDL members beat up an Ethnic immigrant! Bomb the Vatican! Bulldoze Westminster Abbey!

 

EDL members wouldn't be beating the minorities because they're Christian, though; whereas Islamic terrorists do commit acts of terror simply because they are Muslim, and their source of referencing for reason is the Koran.

My family have been connected to the IRA I know what it is thanks. Muslim extremists have a false belief of islam and therefore aren't killing in the name of God.
P.S You are stupid.
 
 
I've got a good idea for how to end global terrorism........build a big camp and put all the Jews in it. We can call it ''the final solution''.

To say that Islamic terrorists aren't killing in the name of God is ludicrous. Of course they are!
 
 
Suppose it could work.

Tit.

Perhaps you should dig your head from your arse and view the reaction of ordinary Muslims and the recruitment material given to the militants whenever a Quran is burnt and the event publicised.

The West is what funded Islamic extremism during the Soviet war against Afghanistan and raised from an infant to a giant 7ft violent beast. I find it hilarious how people now try and find scapegoats because they can't face this simple fact.
 
 
 
Not in the one they claim to! They have this false belief of Jihad.

 

That's like a Muslim saying that a Christian who prays to God, isn't actually praying to god at all... or vice versa.

It's a dangerous and silly line of thinking.
 
 
 
To say that Islamic terrorists aren't killing in the name of God is ludicrous. Of course they are!

 

I wonder why there was almost no Islamic terrorism before the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan?

I wonder why most suicide bombers come from dirt poor areas of rural Afghanistan/Waziristan?

I wonder why most suicide bombers blow up fellow Muslims?? Very logical right? Lets blow up a market place of women and children who believe in exactly the same thing as me in order to honour our God.

Didn't expect anything less from someone who still views Israel as land of God given to the Jews, the land of ****ing milk and honey haha

No it really isn't. All I'm saying is that they have a false conception of Jihad and although they 'claim' they are killing for God they most definitely are not.
And my original point was that you can't fight fire with fire. Theres more to terrorism than Islamic terrorists.
 
 
 
Suppose it could work.

 

Or maybe we should just get rid of all people like you on ALL sides of the coin. Extremists Jews, Christians, Muslims, pigs like you who I've seen support the genocide of Muslims etc.

Without all this scum the world will be such a better place. If only I had control of the world for a bit, I would just enact a humongous purge eliminating all such people.
 
 
Surprised at the lack of substantial, reasoned responses to this post. Sure, I'm not convinced by the OP, but can detractors do better than just label him a troll and call it a stupid idea? Weak analogies won't work either - this idea is not just taking equal revenge to each act, or to give a relatively weak deterrent (e.g. killing them, which they often are happy to have done).

The idea in the OP, while I'm not convinced it would work, is more substantial than that. To attack Mecca (and I mean properly attack the city, not just hurt people living there) would mean more to most extremists than having their lives taken. Why are there suicide bombers? Because some Muslims count things (some of which are vulnerable in earthly combat) as more important than their lives. This idea in the OP tries to ask what the implications of an attack on Mecca would be. Not an attack on people, but a direct attack on the faith.

Now think carefully, rather than just getting angry and insulting people and ideas. Is it possible that an attack on Mecca could, potentially, make Islam illegitimate? Are there promises in Islam to keep Mecca free from attack? If not, then the idea probably is a bad one. But could an attack on a place with such sentimental value (i.e. much more sentimental value than they place on their lives ) deter people? It doesn't seem analogous to simple blood-revenge at all. You can do better, folks.

P.S. Also, note that this is not necessarily being put forth as a consideration, or a proposal that we should do it. This is asking whether it would end Islamic terrorism, not whether we would be right to potentially end it by doing so.

You can scoff all you like. The Jews have the Holy Land and that's not going to change. Jewish life in Israel, as God intended. Funny how Allah doesn't seem to mind his people living under the Jews in the Holy Land, isn't it?

I'm going to ignore that comment about Allah (swt) but why is Israel holy to jews? If it was so 'holy' and if your god intended to have it then surely it would have belonged to jews the whole time?
 
 
extremists in islam dont follow the right teachings of Islam at all and portray it in a really violent way..if such a proposal was made it would make things worse (as these extremists never like to back down and need anything to provoke them)..why should the whole islamic community have to suffer jst because of the actions of those who cant be asked to follow the religion right? most muslims do practice Islam in peace... its enough pain to have these extremists portray our own religion in a horrible way so the proposal will only cause more pain to the actual believers of Islam who do follow the teachings of the religion properly.
 
 
 
Mecca.

 

Your gonna inspire 1000 Arab youths towards terroism for every metre closer you get to that place. If you actually manage to touch the Masjid al-Haram it will be a nightmare for all envovled. the ****storm is imperceptible

Before you weigh up terroism as simly a blood debt which the Arab World owes us gracious, forgiving and virtious Westerners, thing of the thousands of arab cilvians we have killed on our campaigns.

You simply dont understand the very nature of what your dealing with, and what we actually need to be doing.

It wouldnt end anything, bar our society.

No answer, yeah that's what I thought  
 
 
 
I don't think a Muslim would commit an act for which he knows will result in the destruction of a Mosque in Mecca.

 

You're so uninformed it's cute.

Muslims care about Mecca, of course we do, but here are the reasons why your plan won't work:

a) Fighting hatred with hatred leads only (yep you guessed it!) to more hatred.
b) The Mecca buildings are not original. They have been built and rebuilt countless times. As long as they can rebuild it, they won't care how many times you destroy it. It's material. It's a building. It holds little significance compared to the religious meaning it holds. So whether or not it's there, Muslims all round the world will still face the place it should be in when they pray.
c) This relates to a). The West does not own the world, therefore bombing an area, especially a landmark which attracts the highest numbers of people to it in the world, with so much religious significance attached to it will be an act of war. The West would be ultimately declaring war on the entire Middle East plus North Africa plus any other country that sees the complete idiocy of the situation. Hence, WWIII. The West will wish it was in hell before digging a grave like that for itself.
d) You can't just evacuate Mecca. People live there, including the homeless, people constantly pray there, people visit from all over the world. Evacuating it would be a very long process that would ultimately lead to looting, disease from evacuees being in close unsanitary temporary living spaces and most importantly those people adding to the list who hate the West.
e) Finally, and possibly the most important point, these terrorists who murder in the name of "Allah" are not Muslim. Nor will any sane Muslim accept them as such. Therefore if you blow up Mecca, the chances of them backing down are slim to none. You're dealing with psychos here.

You're underestimating Islamic loyalty toward the religion. You don't understand what Allah means to Muslims. This is their life, and they would gladly give it up in the name of Allah. And you know what? If someone as moronic as you suggested this idea as a serious proposal, Muslims would be well within their rights to get angry. Hell, I would be supporting them. To you, the epitome of idiocy, it's an "Us or Them" situation, which is EXACTLY what ending Islamic terrorism shouldn't be about. The more you alienate Muslims, make your life more precious than theirs you lose their trust, respect and the credibility to propose change. You think Islamic terrorism is a result of those particular Muslims just being crazy? Of course not. Those terrorists are uneducated and indoctrinated and deserve death for the murders they commit, but their reasons surpass simply hating the West for the sake of it. Wars in the Islamic world have gone on for decades, wars have been started as a result and we continue to see no change in relations with the West. So bombing them? Probably not going to lead to peace.

You may think the West is completely different from Islamic countries in how you (plural) deal with one another. Muslims send over their terrorists and the West sends over their Soldiers. The difference? A badge, funding and a seal of approval for the Western soldier. In Islamic countries the Western armies are the terrorists- or rather the entire governments are terrorists because the individual soldier, despite pulling the trigger, wasn't the one who made the decision to fight that specific country.

Both sides are flawed. Both need correcting, but as long as hatred and mistrust remain in the mix along with oil, money and power in general, there will be no peace. Your bombing of Mecca plan is quite possibly the most idiotic, unreservedly, frustratingly moronically stupid proposal in the history of the world. Barring the holocaust.
 
 
 
I'm going to ignore that comment about Allah (swt) but why is Israel holy to jews? If it was so 'holy' and if your god intended to have it then surely it would have belonged to jews the whole time?

 

 
Right and what excuse did Yahweh give you for allowing the Holocaust and ensuring that the Jewish global population now is not too dissimilar to what it was thousands of years ago?

 

I cannot claim to fully understand the workings of God. What I do understand is that God promised his people the Holy Land and that, what do you know, 3000 years on, the Holy Land is now once again the Land of the Jews. This is a stupefying defiance of the odds. That such a tiny population would be able to overcome the evils that have tried to destroy it and establish a Jewish Homeland in the Promised Land is proof of the Holy Covenant.

In Islamic countries the Western armies are the terrorists- or rather the entire governments are terrorists because the individual soldier, despite pulling the trigger, wasn't the one who made the decision to fight that specific country.

Both sides are flawed. Both need correcting, but as long as hatred and mistrust remain in the mix along with oil, money and power in general, there will be no peace. Your bombing of Mecca plan is quite possibly the most idiotic, unreservedly, frustratingly moronically stupid proposal in the history of the world. Barring the holocaust.

 

Thank you for a well thought-out post, however, I do not agree entirely.
 
 
 
I cannot claim to fully understand the workings of God. What I do understand is that God promised his people the Holy Land and that, what do you know, 3000 years on, the Holy Land is now once again the Land of the Jews. This is a stupefying defiance of the odds. That such a tiny population would be able to overcome the evils that have tried to destroy and establish a Jewish Homeland in the Promised Land is proof of the Holy Covenant.

 

Fair enough if that's what you believe but there are some gaping holes in your arguments if you look into into it in detail.
 
 
 
Well you supported a potential genocide so I think not.

 

Thats mean.
 
 
What if some EDL/pro-nazi pretends to be "Muslamic" just to get mosques destroyed in Muslim countries? And I seriously doubt that those countries would the west destroy anything... if every single Muslim country joined forces I think they have more than enough firepower to destroy most of the west.
 
 
 
Thats mean.

 

OK.
 
 
This is an absolutely disgusting troll and one of the most offensive posts I've ever seen on TSR.. Please report to mods ffs.
 
 
An eye for an eye leaves us all blind.
 
 
So, Two wrongs make a right?

This coming from an Israeli?

What is it with trolls these days, they're not even trying anymore
 
 
 
SOME zionists?!   none of them do.

 

Haha. Zing.
 
 
 
Surely this will just make things worse? And encourage more Islamic terror.

To be honest I am actually sickened that anyone would suggest such a thing.

 

He's an uber troll. Have you not noticed his ridiculous sig?
 
 
**** you, the state of Israel is more of a terrorist than Islam.
 
 
 
EDL members wouldn't be beating the minorities because they're Christian, though; whereas Islamic terrorists do commit acts of terror simply because they are Muslim, and their source of referencing for reason is the Koran.

 

The commit acts in the name of England. Should we punish all English people and burn down English monuments?

People have committed all kinds of crimes in the name of all kinds of things. That does not mean the whole group should be punished. It is no more the fault of your average, moderate Muslim that there are extremists than it is ours, so why punish him by spitting on his religion?

Also, you still have not even touched upon my point about it doing far my hard than it is good. You opinion is just plain wrong, let's be honest.
 
 
No, this would feed right into their plans. They would beleive a holy war between islam and christendom would be a martyrs battle that would end with them going to paradise.

bear in mind that terrorists do not think rationally
 
 
We could just nuke the middle east and be done with it
