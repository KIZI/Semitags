Their Eyes Are Open But They Do Not See

Throughout much of American history other nations have cast aside any
form of logical thinking when it came to a proper evaluation of out
military capabilities. The English under King George committed the
original under-estimation of our resolve and capabilities during the
War for Independence. His preoccupation with the immediate threat of
England's war with France may have forced the estimation that the
uprising in the American colonies was a pesky little sideshow that
could be dealt with after the war with France. The sideshow escalated
to the point that granting the American colonies independence was
considered preferable thus allowing the full force of England to deal
with the real threat of the time, France. If King George had applied
the easily attained initial forces against the colonies it easily
could have altered the War of Independence to a British victory.
Fortunately King George had underestimated the determined will of the
colonists for independence from the crown and America was born.
