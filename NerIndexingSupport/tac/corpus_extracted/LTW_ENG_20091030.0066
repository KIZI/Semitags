A U.S. District Court judge here on Thursday dismissed a federal lawsuit
challenging President Barack Obama's election on the grounds he was not born
in the United States.

In his opinion, Judge David O. Carter stated it is not within the
constitutional power of the federal courts to "overthrow a sitting
president."

The case, brought by California lawyer Orly Taitz, a leader of the
so-called "birther" movement, claims that Obama doesn't meet the
constitutional qualifications to be president because he has not shown he is
a "natural born citizen" of the U.S.

Obama has produced a birth certificate from Hawaii, but Taitz claims
there is evidence he was born in Kenya.

This case has failed to advance beyond several lower courts. Taitz was
fined $20,000 on Oct. 13 by a federal judge in Columbus, Ga., in part
because Taitz had used the legal system to pursue "political rhetoric and
insults," the judge in that case stated.

In the most recent case, Carter wrote in his opinion how "plaintiffs
have attacked" anyone who has dismissed their claim as "unpatriotic and even
treasonous."

"Respecting the constitutional role and jurisdiction of this court is
not unpatriotic," he said. "Quite the contrary, this Court considers
commitment to that constitutional role to be the ultimate reflection of
patriotism."
