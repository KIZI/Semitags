Yellow jersey wearer Alberto Contador turned a slight shade of pink Friday after
meeting Hollywood stars Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise on the podium of the Tour de
France 18th stage.

A day after French president Nicolas Sarkozy was the guest of race officials on
the legendary Col du Tourmalet, the Hollywood stars got the chance to see the
action close up.

Diaz and Cruise are in France to promote a new film, Knight and Day, and while
they were eager to talk about the race and the country, cycling superstar
Contador looked timid.

"Of course I've seen a lot of your films, but it's a little bit strange seeing
you up close," said the Spaniard.

Contador has an eight-second lead on Luxembourg's Andy Schleck going into the
penultimate stage time trial on Saturday -- a lead he is widely expected to
extend to claim his third yellow jersey triumph.

Although Schleck is still hoping to cause an upset, Contador seemed sure enough
of his eventual triumph to give signed yellow jersey gifts to the actors on the
podium.

"Here is a yellow jersey, which I hope to win on Sunday," the Spaniard added as
he handed the jerseys to Cruise and Diaz.

Contador later admitted that was as far as he got conversing with the movie
celebrities.

Asked if he managed to get Diaz's phone number, he laughed: "I didn't get that
far!"
