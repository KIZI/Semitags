My beloved redsox will of course win their division.. 5 games is still
good for me and will always stay right around there since the Yankees
arent good enough to stay consistent for long without dropping a few
losses.  The Redsox will have the best pitching when playoff time is
near and our bats will come together as one and we will win it all.

Then my Patriots will be led by the greatest qb of our time, Tom
Brady. He will throw at least 45 TDs this year and be the league MVP.
He will also throw for close to 5,000 yds. Randy Moss will be our main
man and he will have himself a season where he catches at least 15 TDs
and has about 90 catches during the season. Our running game will be
unstoppable once our great draft pick Maroney is fully healthy, He
shall show everyone he is the future of the NFL when he rushes for
about 1300 yds and maybe 8 - 10 tds.  We also have quite possibly the
best defense in the AFC and it will be lights out for everyone who
goes up against them.  This team is going 15-1 maybe 14- 2.. I wont
say undefeated because it's a tough thing to do.  I believe we will
meet the st louis rams in the super bowl for a rematch of our 2001
fiesta.

Then there are my Celtics. Usually bad. Owned by Indiana in the
playoffs over the years and just pathetic to watch.  Now they got
Garnett and Ray Allen to compliment Pierce so all looks well. We may
even get Reggie Miller for a part time role. I think this team will be
winning a championship.

BWAHAHAHAHAH!!!!  Had the roles been reversed Yankees would've
clinched about now.  I told you at the start of the season that Julio
Nogo and J.D. Pew were gonna stink up Boston.  Manny?!  Plays when he
feels like it.  Papi?  Limping along, wondering when his next step
will be his last and oh yeah, downing 15 pieces of fried chicken in
one sitting doesn't help your health.

 

Ummm really?  So where did that 14 1/2 game lead go?  Face it it's
that time of the year for the Red Sux to cough up the lead and see the
Yankees clinch again.

 

The LA Angels of Anaheim say "Hi, we've got the best pitching staff in
baseball."  When J.D. Pew couldn't come through in a clutch situation
during a pennant race with the Dodgers, you really expect him to do
the opposite in a city as demanding as Boston?!  BTW,  the number of
runs Nogo knocks in will be less than the number of runs he boots
away.

The Sox and the Pats have a chance, but the Celtics don't have a prayer.
Keep dreaming.

Anthrax442 - The top 6 seeds in the West would beat the Celtics next
year...Allen, Pierce, and Garnett can't all play 48 minutes a night.

Of the NBA Title right now? No.  Of the East?  Hell yes.

 

That is unless those said top 6 don't beat the hell out of each other
first and the survivor becomes easy pickings for them (see 2006 Miami Heat).

If you don't think the fix was in for that series, you're delusional.  Wade
got the call anytime the Mavericks thought about touching him.  I don't
think I've ever seen a series called that badly, ever in any professional
sport.

Anthrax442 - Not saying Stern was in on it, but someone was...

Umm did you see Game 3 of the Spurs/Suns series?  Jesus, each of the
Spurs could've come out with billyclubs, beaten the holy hell out of
each of the Suns players and the refs would've had whistled squat.  Then
again one of the refs *was* Tim Donaghy so...

 

Hmmm...curiouser and curiouser.

Call me a homer, but I still say that not only does Boston not win the
NBA championship, but they don't even win the East, because Detroit is
better.  Yeah, I know the Eastern Conference finals of last year say
"hi," but it looks like Detroit is going to have a real bench this
year and some good young players, and that's what they've been missing
the last couple of years.--Joe (n.j.) [mWo]
