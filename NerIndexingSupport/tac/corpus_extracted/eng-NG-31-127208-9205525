Upon perusing the Dolphins roster, it appears that they thought the strength
of their defense would be their LBs.  Unfortunately, their interior is
ancient with perrennial All-Pro, over the hill Thomas at MLB (12th season),
career missionary/throwaway DT Traylor (16th), and past his prime DT
Holliday (10th).  Miami has 3 awful DBs and the 4th just got promoted.  They
have productive DEs, and their OLBs are their strength.

The dolphins offense is young with 4 rookies starting against the Eagles.
Their strength is their experienced and large OL with a rookie C.  Their
2007 first pick, WR Ginn is averaging 1 catch per game and the other WR, TE
and RB are other teams' rejects.  The other rookie starters are the FB and
QB Beck who is making his first career start.

The Eagles have never had an easier opponent during the Andy Reid era; the
Eagles could win this game with backups.  The Dolphins have a very realistic
chance at finishing 0-16, despite 4 games against NYJ and Buffalo.  I think
Andy Reid wants to score 56 points at home to get the fans back on his side,
and it will make the away Patriots humiliation, less severe.
