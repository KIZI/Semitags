I've been noting for a while that the messianic projection of Obama
has been met by an equal reaponse by his followers.  I mentioned the
time in the Germany speech, where he said the whole world has been
waiting for his time to come (really said that).  Then, there was
Farakan saying that Obama's words were the messiah speaking (really
said THAT).  There was the manifest Obama website that sang a hymn in
the background and said Obama would save the world.

I didn't know, however, that someone was actually chronicling this
movement.  I cannot tell from the website if they are being over the
top satirical or if they REALLY think Obama is the Messiah, but they
provide a wealth of links in the press to the Messiah's rise...

World Net Daily brought the site to the attention of their readers
here...

...where they threw in a few notes, such as a slate.com commentator
saying that "we can't dismiss this possibility out of hand" (about
Obama being the second coming).

It is a fascinating site, although the Obama - Messiah sites seem to
be shutting down after being discovered (why would they run from the
attention...I think someone is shutting them down to operate in
darkness).  However, the numerous quotes are undeniable, and the
magazine cover pages are a part of public record to check out.
