Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said here Tuesday that Turkish people
and government will continue to support and be on the side of Bosnia-
Herzegovina, the semi-official Anatolia news agency reported.

Turkey will support Bosnia-Herzegovina with all its means and is concerned with
its welfare, stability and future, said Davutoglu.

The Turkish official made the remarks at a joint press conference with the
visiting Bakir Izzetbegovic, a member of the Tripartite Presidency of Bosnia-
Herzegovina, after their talks in the Turkish capital of Ankara.

Turkey followed the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina after its Oct. 3 elections
and hoped all political parties in Bosnia- Herzegovina will come together and
form a strong and stable government, Davutoglu said.

For his part, Bakir Izzetbegovic thanked Turkey for contributing to the re-
construction of Bosnia-Herzegovina following the war, saying Turkey is a great
assurance for peace in his country.

He also invited Turkish investors to Bosnia-Herzegovina and assured that his
country will provide all conveniences.
