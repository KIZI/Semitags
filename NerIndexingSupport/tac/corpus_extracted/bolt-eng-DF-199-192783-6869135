 http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/ap/20041103/ap_on_el_st_lo/eln_gay_marriage_9 

In an election that was very very close, I find it interesting that the VAST majority of people in these 10 States have overwhelimingly supported tradition and defeated Gay Marriage by placing a CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT in their States.

Some pundints say "the nation is split on moral issues". Well, maybe not as much as they would have us think.

Why such a overwhelming defeat of Same Sex Marriage?
 
 
I would be very curious as to the demographics of age, as pertained to the vote on this issue. To many older people (me excluded), the entire idea of homosexuality is an uncomfortable one. The thought of gays embracing the institution of marriage, I think, would cause negative reactions.

For many years, gays could not come out of the closet without being discriminated against. I believe that the younger generation is more understanding of what, to some, is a perverse lifestyle. I think that gay marriage will be possible, but probably its time has not come yet!
 
 
It is a sad day here in Michigan today. I am appaled that the right to seperation of chuch and state will not be upheld. Equal rights for all? Yeah....my ass.

Right now, I don't even want to live in a state that deceides it laws based on the religious preference of the majority. The "I don't want to be uncomfortable, so you be uncomfortable" mentality. Why are straight marriages so threatened by the prospect of gay marriage? The gays have obviously screwed with the scanctity of marriage since the divorce rate is around 50%...oh wait, that was straight people that f*ked it up.....If gays want to be misrable to, let 'em. Equal rights!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 
 
Kristi - Michigan voted 51/48 Kerry yet voted 59/41 against same sex marriage.

Therefore, many democratic supporters voted against same sex marriage.

Why is that?
 
 
Apparently people are still scared of what they don't understand.
Or maybe they just don't want to be uncomfortable.
Or maybe they think that if they don't see it, it doesn't exist.
Or perhaps they are just trying to suppress the rights of a group that they don't agree with.

Who knows? Doesn't really matter if you are democratic or republican. Human civil rights are human civil rights.
 
 
homophobes......I should think the answer would be obvious......as we take away peoples abilities to hate other groups of people through legislation, education, enlightenment, time, whatever tools used to accomplish the job, we will, as a result of human nature, find another group to hate.

A group that is hated will red flag our "leaders" and they will then make that hatred an issue in order to draw attention away from the truly dangerous things they are doing and sway as many people as possible to a position that will advance their agenda.

Playing on the ignorance and fear of people is the best tool in a leaders arsenal because hatred and fear are already built into people and therefore are cheap,efficient and ripe for exploitation. When you can get a campaign rolling on more than one hated and feared group at the same time...say queers and towel heads...well.....you could be president.

Because people, on average, are stupid, fearful, and credulous.
 
 
I cannot understand why the outpouring of hatred against the concept of gay marriage. Marriage after all is simply a contract between two people. A contract that is broken by divorce about 50% of the time and not kept probably by about 25% of the remaining people thru cheating and lying and adultery. The sanctity of marriage is in today's environment a myth and a joke.

but a wonderful political smokescreen....
 
 
I wonder how many people abstained from voting on the issue. Many people will only vote on something they care about, leaving the rest of the ballot incomplete.
 
 
I think business had as much to do with the amendment winning as much as "morality".

Extending benefits to same sex couples, when they don't have to, is an expense they are willing to fight not to pay.

I'm the custodial guardian for a little kid. I keep the original court order in my fire safe with copies in my car, in my suitcase, and right inside my front door to guard against problems should there ever be an accident or other emergency.

I have great sympathy for families that have to deal with such paperwork hurdles to care for the people they love. Its absurd.

"Sorrow" is the only word I can find to describe my feelings about this vote.
 
 
I think you're right, FreeDuck. By far, most of the people who felt strongly about this issue were against gay marriage.

<SIGH>
 
 
boomerang

Can't agree it is misplaced morality.
 
 
I think the same-sex marriage ban was put forth in states where there was over-whelming support already. But, I haven't really looked at all the numbers and histories.
 
 
I'm not sure I follow you, au.....

The financial I am sure never enters the equasion. It is the imposition of their supposed morality upon others.

Are you saying there isn't a moral majority?
 
 
For the masses, it's a moral issue. Very few ordinary people are worried about the financial aspects of gay marriage.

There could very well be a financial aspect to gay marriage. Gay men are more then likely to have AIDS then any other group and it isn't a cheap sickness to deal with. People talk about smoking and the effect cancer has on health care, why wouldn't the same concern apply to AIDS and homosexuality?

So by this completely ridiculous logic, smokers shouldn't marry either.  
 
 
Perhaps....

I don't know.....

The financial aspects did enter into many conversations I had with people -- perhaps because I am a business owner who strongly opposed the amendment in Oregon.

But truly it was those "for the children" windbags that made me want to start ranting.

I'm not gay. In fact, my 15 year traditional marriage anniversary is tomorrow. But I have lived the same "for the children" problems that many gay families face and honest to God, cross my heart and hope to die, it breaks my heart that people belive this amendment is moral in any shape or form.

What is your question? Are you implying that because they are a majority they can impose their religious beliefs upon the rest of us. The majority of this nation is Christian should they by way of majority impose their religious beliefs?. What helped make this nation great was the concept of separation of church and state. Bush and the religious right are trying to negate that principle.
 
 
All I feel is pity for people whose thinking is so shallow that it leads them to believe this amendment is moral.

Did you ever stop to think that some people's morality isn't based on religion? Looking at the winning margin in the states which chose to protect marriage do you really think the "religious right" has that many people and or supporters? I'm not of the religious right, due to my being an agnostic or a deist (depending on your definition). I base it on science and homosexuality doesn't stand up to a scientific test in any manner.
 
 
Does that make gays any less capable of feeling strong emotion for another human being?

This whole thing is absurd! Seperation of church and state! It is a moral issue for most people. And the majority has once again run over the minority. I don't agree with lots of things people do but I don't vote a ban on that activity. Ignorance and fear has prevailed!    
 
 
Kristie - NO ONE has suggested the the ACTIVITY be banned. In my opinion, this has NOTHING to do with religious beliefs.

ANY 2 people (Home or Hetro sexual) who enter into any relationship whereby property rights, financial rights are shared should enjoy the same financial benefits that married couples do.

In my opinion, this homosexual marriage issues revolves around the financial/property rights that currently are not available to ANY home or hetro sexual couple.

No one needs the States approval to live together, acquire property together, provide financia support together.

What surprised me was Ohio including civil unions as unconstitutional.

I would support civil unions for ANY couple. Yet I would support a ban on same sex marriage.

I think Kristie is missing the point.

Michigan did too. And my point is that this isn't financial. Ask nearly any ban supporter and they will tell you that it is about the scanctity of marriage or the state of morality in the country or....blah blah blah...if you are against it for financial reasons you are in the minority. And if you believe that it is purely financial, YOU are missing the point.
 
 
The Gay marriage ban was on the Ohio ballot and passed despite opposition from business groups, the Republican Party establishment and both US Senators. Ohio business felt that it would put business at a disadvantage in attracting quality people with special and needed skills. Financial considerations are not the source of approval for this measure.
 
 
"Ohio business felt that it would put business at a disadvantage in attracting quality people with special and needed skills."

That seems outrageous; people won't move to or will move out of Ohio?
 
 
I am in a commited interracial relationship (now a marriage). It wasn't that long ago that interracial marriages were prohibited by law.

If a state discriminated against my chosen relationship, you better believe I take my skills elsewhere.
 
 
Just a question: Who put homosexual marriage in the agenda?

IMHO, it's obvious it was going to hurt the Democrats.

me too ebrown....squinney is part of the human race.....
 
 
It seems (unfortunately) that this may be a long battle. The ban on gay marriage seems to mirror what went on in U.S. history in regard to interracial marriages.

Laws prohibiting interracial marriage (known as miscegenation laws) are considered America's longest-lasting form of legal race discrimination--lasting far longer than slavery or school segregation. Miscegenation laws were in effect for nearly three centuries, from 1664 until 1967, when the U.S. Supreme Court finally declared them unconstitutional in the Loving decision.

The first law against interracial marriage was passed in Maryland in 1664. By the time of the Civil War, these laws covered most of the south, much of the mid-West, and were beginning to appear in western states.

In the late 1870s, legislators, policymakers, and, above all, judges began to marshal the arguments they needed to justify the reinstatement--and subsequent expansion--of miscegenation law.

Here are four of the arguments they used:
1) First, judges claimed that marriage belonged under the control of the states rather than the federal government.
2) Second, they began to define and label all interracial relationships (even longstanding, deeply committed ones) as illicit sex rather than marriage.
3) Third, they insisted that interracial marriage was contrary to God's will, and
4) Fourth, they declared, over and over again, that interracial marriage was somehow "unnatural."
On this fourth point--the supposed "unnaturality" of interracial marriage--judges formed a virtual chorus. Here, for example, is the declaration that the Supreme Court of Virginia used to invalidate a marriage between a black man and a white woman in 1878:
The purity of public morals," the court declared, "the moral and physical development of both races.require that they should be kept distinct and separate that connections and alliances so unnatural that God and nature seem to forbid them, should be prohibited by positive law, and be subject to no evasion.
The fifth, and final, argument judges would use to justify miscegenation law was undoubtedly the most important; it used these claims that interracial marriage was unnatural and immoral to find a way around the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of "equal protection under the laws." The judges insisted that because miscegenation laws punished both the black and white partners to an interracial marriage, they affected blacks and whites "equally." This argument, which is usually called the equal application claim, was hammered out in state supreme courts in the late 1870s, endorsed by the United States Supreme Court in 1882, and would be repeated by judges for the next 85 years.

Don't these arguments sound very similar to agruments against gay marriages? Fortunately now interracial marriages are no longer illegal. And hopefully gay marriages will not have to wait so long to be legal.
 
 
You are right linkat but it is SO FRUSTRATING waiting! I am not a gay women. I am married to a man, however I still have to use my voice to help those who's voices are not so loud yet. I had hoped that Michigan would come through for me but alas, they are not ready to accept everyone. Gotta be white and straight to live a happy life in Michigan.    
 
 
It is hard Kristie and one would think we could learn from our past, but I guess we are destined to continue making the same mistakes. The best thing is to show support even that I am sure helps those that are giving the same rights. Kind of ironic that we are fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan and celebrating the fact that as a result women can vote and many people can now be free when we prevent these same freedoms in our own country toward our own citizens.

I love your quote!
 
 
Thanks...it's in honor of my frustration at the ignorance and fear that still exists in this country, and how it effects real people.
 
 
Let's not forget that in Ohio, it is also illegal to get a fish drunk. Somehow that puts the vote against gay marriage in perspective to me.
 
 
    Wow....that makes a lot of things make sense....

and yet once drunk it's not illeagal to f*#k a pig....go figure......
 
 
  For Kristie, as you are a married woman living in Michigan, don't try cutting your own hair witout hubby's permission. According to Michigan law, a man legally owns his wife's hair.
 
 
That's why he was so pissed the last time I got a hair cut....    
 
 
Yer off to the big house now Kristie.  
 
 
rats....
 
 
Here are some other strange laws in Michigan - becareful Kristie..In Detroit, it is illegal to ogle a woman from a moving car. In Port Huron, the speed limit for ambulances is 20 mph. Under state law, dentists are officially classified as mechanics. In Clawson, it is legal for a farmer to "sleep with his pigs, cows, horses, goats, and chickens".
 
 
Well, I've always suspected those Clawson folk to be a little on the "ya know" side.....

It's funny you should mention the dentist thing. Mine gave me a root canal and fixed my carburetor yesterday. Got a great discount.

Because only 2% of the population and bleeding hearts voted for it.
 
 
Homosexual Marriage will be legal in the future. This is just the beginning of the battle that will inevitably lead to equal rights.

Look at the fight to end slavery. The conservatives fought, but the liberals won in the end.

Look at the fight to give women the vote. The conservatives fought, but the liberals won in the end.

Look at the Fight for integrated schools and civil rights and evolution....

The fact is that the young always give up (albeit slowly) the prejudices of the old. This is already happening as gay bashing is way down, and "Queer eye" is a well known TV show.

Not only that, the dire predictions about the end of heterosexual marriages in Massachusetts were obviously overblown (my marriage is doing fine), and in 5 or 10 years gay marriages will be accepted with a yawn-- same as mixed race marriages and selling beer on Sundays.

From slavery to wife-beating to lynching to the KKK. The bleeding hearts always win in the long run.
 
 
Dont mean to hijack this thread or return to old posts but I am curious and a bit disturbed by this post.

This is just one of the things that scares me about The Left It sounds alot like mind control to me. How can you propose to dictate an individuals thoughts and emotions? Do you really belive that you will eliminate hate through social engineering? What else might be lost in the process?

It sounds to me like you have developed an Ideal Human Attitude that you wish to instill in everybody through government policy and intervention. This right out of 1984, this is Big Brother. It might be the governments job to intervene when people are threatened, but not to formulate thought in Halls of Congress. It is scary that this is the Lefts "obvious" solution to a problem.

The guys who thought up Civil Rights sure seemed to think so.

And we're doing pretty well. Look how far we've come in the last 50 years, as compared to the... entirety of human history previously.

nice try...I proposed no obvious solution...I pointed out that the obvious answer to the question was homophobes.....the entire point of my post is that you can not dictate an individuals thoughts and emotions and therefore there will alway be a hated group and that leaders will use that hate to their own furtherment....I think you know that but spun my statement to score points on the "left"....you'll have be more clever than that I'm afraid :wink:
 
 
I wouldnt be so quick to attirbute our progress to the Civil Rights Act. You cannot legislate feelings and emotions.

So you did not put forth the phrase "take away peoples abilities to hate" as a solution to homophobia? 'Cause thats how I read it.
 
 
I live in Mississippi and gay marriage was voted down like 80 to 20. When I saw those numbers I was shocked   I find it hard to believe that 80 percent of people can agree on anything, much less something as controversial as gay marriage. I seriously think one of the main reasons for the opposition is because it is "gross". The only thing I find gross, however, is the constant need that Americans have to oppress, whether it be The Blacks, the Non-Christians, or The Gays...Sad, sad story.
 
 
 
I wouldnt be so quick to attirbute our progress to the Civil Rights Act. You cannot legislate feelings and emotions.
 

Dumb-ass argument. You may not be able to legistlate feelings and emotions per se, but you can legislate acts, such as marriage, that are based on feelings and emotions. You can legislate plenty of things based on feelings and emotion, such as charging a man with murder for a crime of passion. You can imprison or kill terrorists for acting on what they feel. You can hospitalize people with violent dissociative disorders for being potentially harmful to others or themselves, even if they feel, to the depths of their soul, that they were commanded by Pope Clement to kill the Templar Knights.
 
 
Thank the Supreme Court of the State of Mass for energizing the people in those States who voted down Gay Marriage.

Obviously, the VAST MAJORITY of those citizens, both Democrat and Republicans, did not care to have a very small minority of people dictate or force their "morals" upon them.

The liberals on the east and west coasts do NOT represent the Nation. Their agenda has been rejected by the majority.

What a relief !!!

No the vast majority wanted to force their morals on the minority... hmmm...sounds historically faimilar....

Just because a large group wants something doesn't make it right.

And for the record, I happen to be part of the "very small minority" and I don't live on the east or west coast and I am not a liberal. I am just a woman who believes in the civil rights of all US citizens, not just those with the loudest voice.
 
 
I agree with Kristy and I am one of those rowdy Texans.
 
 
Kristie - The people did not ban the LIFESTYLE. Most States did not ban civil unions which provides ALL the financial and decision making benefits of married couples. they just do NOT want to call it a marriage.

What part do you NOT get??

This is the attitude that energized Democrats and Republicans to get out amend their States constitution.

When 8 out of 10 disagree with your position, maybe it is time for YOU to re-think your position and move on to accept a compromise such as civil unions.

Well Woiyo, the part that I don't get it the part where you people think that just because you're the majority, you get to be right.  

And civil unions are NOT in option in my state now, so perhaps you should get your facts straight.

Now you want to quibble about the terminology of it? Talk about struggling for a good argument. The point is that you homophobes are too scared to let people with a different lifestyle be happy. Also, I don't believe that the ballot said Yes or No on calling it marriage. This wasn't a vote for terminology.  
 
 
There you go Kriste. Start with the name calling.

You pig-headedness has hampered you ability to argue the point with someone WHO SUPPORTS YOUR LIFESTYLE!!!!

Life is not always fair and sometime you have to compromise.

You completely ignored the statement that the vote was not a vote against the LIFESTYLE!!!!

It is your attitude that drove the masses out to vote against you, but you (and those like you) are too stubborn to see the possibility of compromise.

Too bad for you.

  It isn't my lifestyle. That's the beauty of it. And I didn't ignore your comment on the lifestyle.

THERE IS NO COMPROMISE. Why should there be? Seperate but equal was a compromise. That didn't make things any better. So how should there be a compromise? I am eager to hear your compromise on this.
 
 
 
There you go Kriste. Start with the name calling.
 

That is what a person who is afraid of homosexuals is called, no? It seems to me that most of the supporters of this ban are frightened of the prospect of letting "those people" into the American Dream. God forbid they corrupt the country....
 
 
Even now that the election is over and we as citizens should be keeping an eye on what bush plans to do to us in his second term, we are still going to be kept busy talking about this non issue.........wringing our hands, getting our panties in a bunch....while the administration continues to pick our pockets.....sigh...
 
 
My panties aren't in a bunch. Lively discussion on this end. I can't speak for woiyo of course.
 
 
If what you say is true, then woiyo. Do you believe that interracial couples should be banned from marriage, but should have the right for civil unions? Well, that was the attitude not that long ago and look where we are now

Let me try this one Link. You are not comparing the same thing here. It was absolutely wrong not to allow interracial couples to marry. They were denied the right to do what every other man and woman was allowed to do. A homosexual is free to marry anyone of the opposite sex anytime they choose. Thus there is no discrimination as long as the law is applied to all people equally. It is. Blacks were denied the right to marry someone of the opposite sex if that person was white. Thus, the law was not being applied equally to them. This is why it was discriminatory.
 
 
"THERE IS NO COMPROMISE. Why should there be? Seperate but equal was a compromise. That didn't make things any better. So how should there be a compromise? I am eager to hear your compromise on this. "

The compromise is CIVIL UNIONS. So long as ANY couple can pass property, make health decisions, adopt, file taxes jointly, etc... same as a married couple.

Does anyone really need the States "blessing" to live together and love each other?? NO!!!!

So long as the benefits are the same, I do not see the problem.
 
 
I will repeat: Michigan has banned civil unions as well.
 
 
Coastalrat your disagreement is similar to an argument that was set up against interracial couples marrying:
"The fifth, and final, argument judges would use to justify miscegenation law was undoubtedly the most important; it used these claims that interracial marriage was unnatural and immoral to find a way around the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of "equal protection under the laws." The judges insisted that because miscegenation laws punished both the black and white partners to an interracial marriage, they affected blacks and whites "equally." "

Basically you can twist almost anything to have it fit in a nice tidy bundle. You are denying homosexuals the same right. By denying them to marry some one of the same sex, you are basically saying you cannot marry as homosexuals would have no desire to marry some one of the opposite sex, the argument is ludicrous. You not applying the law equally to them since you are taking away their opportunity to marry.

Woiyo - the States are not "blessing" anyone, as "blessing" is a religious terminology. The States are legalizing the marriage. Do you need the States "blessing" to live together and love each other?? I propose that the States should not be involved at all in legalizing or "blessing" marriages. I propose that the States only have the power to legislate Civil Unions for all couples (Homosexual or Heterosexual) since marriage has such a religious connotation. So all "marriages" by the justice of the peace are denoted as civil unions. That way according to the government we are all equal with civil unions and all have the same legal stuff - property, adopting, taxes, etc. Leave the term "marriage" to the churches. To me that would solve all these differences.
 
 
 
I propose that the States only have the power to legislate Civil Unions for all couples (Homosexual or Heterosexual) since marriage has such a religious connotation. So all "marriages" by the justice of the peace are denoted as civil unions. That way according to the government we are all equal with civil unions and all have the same legal stuff - property, adopting, taxes, etc. Leave the term "marriage" to the churches. To me that would solve all these differences.
 

In the early 17th century in states (colonies) such as Massachusetts and Connecticut this was the only kind of marriage that was available. It change because of the opposition and influence of the clergy (Protestant). I see no reason why we can not return to that.
 
 
I will state again, the battle for civil rights is different then the battle for gay marriage. Blacks don't have an option of being black. We know that being black is a genetic thing and can't be helped. Science backs it; the same thing cannot be said about being gay. People can say they are born that way, but there in nothing to back it up.

Prove through science that people are born gay and there won't be an issue. At this point in time, homosexuality is a choice and we shouldn't change society on people's choice.
 
 
Baldimo - do you believe that smoking causes lung cancer? Do you assume that a fetus will become a baby? No one fully understands any of this stuff, but we tend to all believe that Lung cancer can be caused by smoking, that little cell clusters will miraculously become a human being. No one can even fully explain why atoms form into cohesive units like human bodies.

So, none of the above proves that gay people are biologically designated as such, but it sort of discounts your theory, doesn't it?
 
 
And, by the way, no one really can prove how electricity works either, so you may want to turn off your computer.
 
 
ignorance

 
So long as the benefits are the same, I do not see the problem.
 

There is a HUGE problem--whether you choose to see it or not. The United States Supreme Court has ruled that the "separate but equal" doctrine is unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. See Brown v. Board of Education
 
 
When can we expect the teaching of evolution to be banned.
 
 
Baldimo, homosexuals do not have the option of not being homosexual either. Personally I did not make a conscience decision to be heterosexual, I was just attracted to men not women. Did you make a conscience decision to be attracted to the opposite sex or is it just innate to you?

Just for arguments sake, lets say what you say is true. In the same vain, say a black is attracted to a white person. Well since it is not genetic, and they have the choice, it should be illegal for interracial marriages and relationships.
 
 
How long until a bi-sexual decides he/she wants both a husband and a wife?
 
 
That's polygamy...a different subject altogether.......
 
 
What would keep that from happening? We are going to open a huge can of worms!
 
 
No we are not. What is being proposed is that a marriage will be a union between two humans.

More than two? We've already got that, it's called a corporation.
 
 
I have yet to see the wording for this if it is written as "2 humans" fine but I doubt that will be the case.
 
 
Yeehaw, maybe I'll finally be able to marry my goat.
 
 
Nanny or billy?
 
 
I was joking.
 
 
Saskatchewan now says,
 
"The common-law definition of marriage for civil purposes is declared to be 'the lawful union of two persons to the exclusion of all others,' "

You just never know from Boston......just kidding.
 
 
How did Hotlanta vote this election?
 
 
I don't know yet, but from all of the Kerry signs.... On the gay rights issue Atlanta has a pretty heavy gay population.....
 
 
That's what I remembered.
 
 
 
Just a question: Who put homosexual marriage in the agenda?

IMHO, it's obvious it was going to hurt the Democrats.
 

Let me insist on my question.

I don't know how many otherwise politically indifferent people went to the polls thinking on "defending family values from the homosexual agenda", cared a lot about these church-oriented issues and, while they were there, voted for Bush.
Should I count them by the thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions?

In any case, I think the democrats let the issue to be set too high in the agenda, and lost the most for the least.

For the record, I personally would vote against any ban on homosexual marriages.
 
 
I'm just guessing fbaezer, but I'd say millions. I think there was a lot of pushing of this issue in various churches.

And it wasn't just the homosexual agenda they were voting against - they are hoping to put an end to legal abortion as well.
 
 
 
Prove through science that people are born gay and there won't be an issue. At this point in time, homosexuality is a choice and we shouldn't change society on people's choice.
 

Baldimo,
As Frank pointed out to you earlier, the fact that the very thought of homosexual sex is repulsive to most heterosexuals shows that it is NOT a choice issue. There is absolutely no way that I could choose to be gay, therefore it is perfectly understandable to me that the reverse is also true.
 
 
 
Baldimo - do you believe that smoking causes lung cancer?
 

I think smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer, even though there are those people who don't smoke who still get it.

 
Do you assume that a fetus will become a baby?
 

As long as it isn't aborted by an uncaring mother and her Dr.

 
No one fully understands any of this stuff, but we tend to all believe that Lung cancer can be caused by smoking, that little cell clusters will miraculously become a human being.
 

You are right about the above, but it has all been proven by science and not left to wonder. The left tend to embrace science when they can use it to control people and gain power. When it comes to something that they believe in, and they don't want science to get in the way, they want to use faith and force that faith upon everyone else. Sounds like the claims from the left about the right and morals.

 
No one can even fully explain why atoms form into cohesive units like human bodies.
 

Sure we can, did you miss your science class in chemistry or physics? It is all down to the electrons and the bonds between them. Remember opposites attract. Positive to a negative but in the subatomic world of atoms, these electrical bonds are very strong. Don't forget we have also discovered things smaller then atoms. Science is truly a wonderful thing.

 
So, none of the above proves that gay people are biologically designated as such, but it sort of discounts your theory, doesn't it?
 

As explained, we happen to know the answer to several of the questions that you just asked. It still doesn't prove whether people are born gay or not, but I would love to see the research.

 
Baldimo, homosexuals do not have the option of not being homosexual either.
 

Do you know this for a fact, or do you know this because this is what has been told to you? As I have noted before, science can prove or disprove any number of things, why not apply it to the homosexual situation. Just because someone says that they are born gay doesn't it make it that way? Are people born to be murderers or rapists? Would you accept that as an explanation for their behavior?

 
Personally I did not make a conscience decision to be heterosexual, I was just attracted to men not women. Did you make a conscience decision to be attracted to the opposite sex or is it just innate to you?
 

Here's the difference between heterosexuals and homosexuals. Heterosexuals do what nature intended and that is to be attracted to the opposite sex for the reason of having children and further the human species. There is nothing natural about homosexuality and it doesn't do anything that nature intended. If homosexuality were natural then the human species would be much smaller then it is today.

 
Just for arguments sake, lets say what you say is true. In the same vain, say a black is attracted to a white person. Well since it is not genetic, and they have the choice, it should be illegal for interracial marriages and relationships.
 

There is no argument sake on this issue. Men and women were meant to be together to procreate the species. You see this all through nature. When you look at horses, it doesn't matter what color the horse is, they are still attracted to the opposite sex of horse. It is the same with humans. Color is genetic and so is the drive to mate with the opposite sex. Without this genetic drive to mate the first animals would have been the only animals.

 
Baldimo,
As Frank pointed out to you earlier, the fact that the very thought of homosexual sex is repulsive to most heterosexuals shows that it is NOT a choice issue. There is absolutely no way that I could choose to be gay, therefore it is perfectly understandable to me that the reverse is also true.
 

I find the act of murder repulsive as well as the act of pedophilia, and you won't me doing any of these things. Does this mean people are born to kill others and still others are born to have sex with children?
 
 
baldimo how do you reconcile the fact that you find murder repulsive with the obvious glee you and pride you show in proclaiming "coming to a justified war near you?" either you dig killing or you don't......
 
 
There is a difference between murder and war. I never said I "dig killing".
 
 
riiiight....
 
 
You don't know me so you don't know do you?
 
 
 
There is nothing natural about homosexuality and it doesn't do anything that nature intended.
 

Actually, homosexual activity is found throughout the natural world, in primates, in birds and even fish. It is a natural occurence and the sooner we recognize that marriage ought to be the union of two humans, whatever their sex, the better off we will be. Same sex marriage will remove the stigma placed on homosexuals based on an out-dated and mis-guided philosophy, strengthen society by encouraging more long term relationships and open our experience of that natural world to something closer to reality.
 
 
Let's assume we are non-partisan here Baldimo. Noboy is judging anyone. This is strictly for the purpose of balanced and friendly debate. What is it exactly that you want others to know about you, peronally, and why do you feel slighted by others who clearly don't understand you, or your position, politically?
 
 
Those things I mentioned above were not proven, they are assumed to be a reality because theories can be built upon them. No one can even see the whole picture inside an atom, so the workings therein are also assumed to be as we describe them, because THAT works for us. If anything is proven it's by deduction.
 
 
Baldimo
Your theme has been on subject after subject prove it. And if you can't I do not believe.
I would ask, do you believe in God and if so can you prove he exists.

YEAH JOE!! Good post! Agree, agree, agree!  
 
 
Honestly, I keep saying this but I truly don't understad the big brou ha ha here....why can't everyone take this posittion?

I am not a homosexual...the idea of sex with another man is repugnant to me...hterefore I don't want another man to try to have sex with me. Period. That's the end of it. Otherwise what's the problem?

Let gays do everything they want to do that breeders do, have every right and responsibility and be left alone to go about their business.

Just don't touch my ass please fellas, I ain't into it. Happy to buy you a beer though, talk politics, music, sports, whatever, help you out with some yardwork or moving a heavy couch.

See how simple that is?

What a great Stephen King novel "Breeders"

Vampires and Gays form an evil allianceand take over the world....as the story begins.....a handful of heterosexual humans are selectively kept in breeding facilities to perpetuate both the vampire and gay species......gays and vampires coexist peacefully...everyone has a cool fashion sense and the world is neatly decorated.....gay babies are incubated in the wombs of these women by being implanted with gay sperm and then the heterosexual babies are kept for food for the vampires.....except for one brave couple who begin the underground breeder revolution movement.......and the story takes off....

Why is the government involved in a religious rite anyway? That is the fundamental problem. Get rid of it, re-define marriage as civil unions between any two people who want to commit as lifetime partners. If people want to marry, let their church do it.

Not doubting you at all, but does someone have a backup for this? I would like to read it, one of the main arguements I hear is that humans are the only animal that have homosexual tendencies.

Throughout history religion has been the catalyst for divisiveness with their holier than thou attitude. The American Taliban [Evangelists] is as much a danger to this nation as fundamental Islam is.

You know McGentrix I spent some time in the corner for this kind of posting....perhaps you need a time out.....
 
 
I gave your statement the most appropriate answer.

Peoples fear of other peoples religion is ridiculous. What's the worse thing that could possibly happen? What is it about people of faith that have the liberals in such an uproar? Is it the insecurity in knowing others have a belief system?

We live in a free country, which means people are free to practice their religion as they see fit. 70% of this country are practicing Christians and no matter what us non-christians believe or don't believe we must live with that.
 
 
 
now as a technical question how will or does the law define a post op transgendered person?
 

Depends, of course, on the state, most states will change gender status after proof of Genital Re-assigment Surgery. However, some states will change gender status before GRS, generally, needing a statement from a doctor that the TG person is living in the role of the new gender. I just changed ny name, went to the Driver's License Office to get the DL changed, the clerk a real nice woman, is inputting the new data, she says OK but I have to leave the gender data the same, have you had GRS, I lied and said yes, she said well, I need a letter as proof, I said jokingly, well, what if I just showed it to you! She cracked up.

Anyway, I am going to wait a few months and then try to get the gender marker changed. Now, since I am inclined toward women, if I met a woman that I wanted to marry, I could stay male as far as my records go and legally marry her. But I doubt whether any transsexuals would ever actually do that as the overriding concern for us is to be fully accpeted in our true gender.

Anyone who is curious about this issue or wants to learn more should read "True Selves" My therapist Gianna E. Israel has written an excelent book as well " Transgender Care."
 
 
So then by your statement you agree that heterosexuals must live with homosexuals, correct? And if we are free to practice our own religion, then we must all be free to practice our own sexuality. And our own life style. So, what's with the ban?

against the law or not, the result is the same....and the law does not deter it anymore than it deters any other crime of ignorance or "passion"....
 
 
McG
Yes it is a free country and people should be able to practice or not practice religion as they see fit. And indeed the law of the land calls for separation of church and state. Unfortunately, the evangelists do not believe in that concept. They would have everyone through legislation be forced to adhere to what they deem to be moral.

Do you need to ask?
 
 
You are right about the seperation of church and state. Marriage is a religious institution. Thus, the government should keeps it's nose out of it and enact a civil union available to all couples.

That's the reality of the situation. Gay marriage will not be legal in the US. If I were a homosexual, I would be aiming for the civil union that grants the same rights as marriage. It's a losing fight to try to legalize gay marriage, but most people will support the civil union.
 
 
I agree with you McGen. Marriage is a religious ceremony. Leave it in the church. Make civil unions available. You can be legally married without being married in a church now so why not just make the split and make it official?
 
 
McG, it may take awhile but gays will eventually be bestowed the same rights as everyone.
 
 
I must be missing something here. I am under the impression that gays have the exact same rights as everyone else in this country. What they want is to change the law to give them additional rights.

Like McG, I think more support will be given to gay unions if provisions are made to differentiate between marriages (a religious rite) and civil unions (a secular rite).

I have been married 5 times....twice in a church...twice by a JP...once by a magistrate......all the marriages save one ended in divorce....like 50% of every marriage...I am not unusual.....where does the sacred religious rite part come in?
 
 
before anyone chimes in...yes, five marriages may be unusual but marriage ended in divorce is not, which is what I was getting at....
 
 
McG
In this nation and in most nations marriage can be a religious or a civil function. In reality marriage is simply a legal contract between to people and nothing more. The sanctity of marriage is a fraud. As I have noted previously 50% of marriages end up in divorce and more than likely 25% of the reaming are chasing around breaking the contract.
 
 
BPB

Married five times. You must be a glutton for punishment. :wink:
 
 
No, the sanctity of marriage is a fraud to some people. To others it is very real and very important. Why should we make their beliefs less important than anyone elses?
 
 
 
I must be missing something here. I am under the impression that gays have the exact same rights as everyone else in this country.
 

You are under a totally wrong impression. It is legal in most places to discriminate in hiring, housing, etc against gays, lesbians, bisexual and trans persons.
 
 
No it isn't.

BPB, let me better explain my thinking. Forget about the sad state of most marriages today. Too many people, IMO, get married for the wrong reasons and with very little thought (thanks in part to no fault divorces, but that is another issue).

Currently, civic and religious marriages are recognized by all parties as legal unions, both by the church and by governments for legal reasons. My thought is to differentiate the ceremonies so that churches, for religious reasons, have no legal compulsion to recognize civil unions if said unions violate church doctrine (as gay unions would).

I think much of the fear of gay unions by christians is that the government, wielding tax exempt status as a weapon, will force churches to recognize gay unions as legit. To me, this appears to be a reasonable fear. Creating gay unions as a seperate entity outside of marriage to recognize the rights of the two partners in regard to the others property et al would be more palatable to many more christians than what is being attempted now.
 
 
 
No, the sanctity of marriage is a fraud to some people. To others it is very real and very important. Why should we make their beliefs less important than anyone elses?
 

and therein lies the problem....elevating one groups beliefs equates to lowering your groups beliefs in your eyes and the eyes of those like you.....as long as no one is willing to abandon this narrow view, these problems will persist.......

God forbid the church should have to choose between sticking to their convictions or maintaining their tax exempt status.......tell the churches if they don't honor gay marriage they'll have to pay taxes and they'll start opening an extra day just to perform gay wedding ceremonies   :wink:  
 
 
 
No it isn't.
 

Yes it is.

Rat, how do two women in San Fransisco getting married have any effect on you?
 

Never said it did Harper. The only effect at this time is that it is against the law. They want the law changed. Not me. They need to prove why this country should change its laws to accomodate them. Most of what they want to accomplish can be done thru legal contracts (property right issues, power of attorney, etc). About the only thing they truly gain that they have no access to now by legalizing marriage is related to tax issues, and this can be done by creating a civil union that need not be recognized by churches.

BPB, I used the tax exempt status as one example. And you know what, I would be a lot of churches would give up their tax exempt status over this, and many won't because they have moved away from biblical authority already and won't care. Other issues that I think (again, this is just my own opinion here) are a problem is the possibility of gays suing churches for membership, for leadership positions and so on. Again, I am maybe placing my opinion here in the mouth of the churches, so I could be wrong. Just looking at it as I think churches are looking at it.

Wow, this is appalling, it really is. Why do you care if they get the law changed to get the same rights you have, how does it affect you? I will tell you how it affects you, it bothers your prejudicial and outmoded beliefs and fears. This next statement reveals how totally misinformed CR is:

We would find out which churches are being true to their beliefs and which ones were only paying lip service, that is for sure. As a Christian, I would hope there would be more than a few sticking up for our beliefs, but I do fear you are probably closer to being right about the number.

Rat, how do two women in San Fransisco getting married have any effect on you?
 

Never said it did Harper. The only effect at this time is that it is against the law. They want the law changed. Not me. They need to prove why this country should change its laws to accomodate them. Most of what they want to accomplish can be done thru legal contracts (property right issues, power of attorney, etc). About the only thing they truly gain that they have no access to now by legalizing marriage is related to tax issues, and this can be done by creating a civil union that need not be recognized by churches.
 

Such a union already exists, it's called marriage, now all we need to do is extend it to encompass gay and lesbian people.

Oh, and the 'burden of evidence' if you may always lies on those who would enact restrictive legislation to prove that it is beneficial. The default is freedom of choice.

 
BPB, I used the tax exempt status as one example. And you know what, I would be a lot of churches would give up their tax exempt status over this, and many won't because they have moved away from biblical authority already and won't care.
 

Personally I don't think religion should be tax exempt in the first place, but what do I know.

 
Other issues that I think (again, this is just my own opinion here) are a problem is the possibility of gays suing churches for membership, for leadership positions and so on. Again, I am maybe placing my opinion here in the mouth of the churches, so I could be wrong. Just looking at it as I think churches are looking at it.
 

I don't see that happening as a result of gay marriage, but perhaps you are making a slippery slope argument?
 
 
Harper, where have I said I care if they get the law changed?? I did not. We are a nation of laws, and as a Christian, I may disagree with gay marriage, but I will follow the laws which govern this nation.

The gay agenda is doing all they can to insist that everyone recognize their lifestyle as normal and acceptable. Christians do not believe the lifestyle is normal or acceptable, yet you would have churches forced to recognize a union of two men or two women just as they would a man and wife union. Where here is the seperation of church and state that you and others are so fond of pushing?

Those in the gay rights movement are doing a great disservice to themselves by attempting an end run around the laws rather than using LEGAL means to change the laws. They have every right to try to change them. Christians and other people of faith have every right to try to keep the laws from being changed. But all of us need to obey the laws until change is made.

Repeat after me:

Marriage
and
Church

are two completely different things. A marriage is a legal binding contract between two people; a church is a place where one has their marriage.

There's no reason to even bring religion into the argument.

As for your first point in this paragraph,

 
The gay agenda is doing all they can to insist that everyone recognize their lifestyle as normal and acceptable.
 

Sounds just like those pesky African-Americans did a while back. Maybe we should learn a lesson from that time period?

I must be missing something here. I am under the impression that gays have the exact same rights as everyone else in this country.
 

You are under a totally wrong impression. It is legal in most places to discriminate in hiring, housing, etc against gays, lesbians, bisexual and trans persons.
 

Please name the places
 

Everywhere without a local ordinance banning discrimination against GLBT persons and everywhere where same-sex marriage is banned. Can you people possibly be this misinformed?
 

Can you be more misinformed? In the State of GA it is illegal to refuse rental of a dwelling to anyone based on age race or sexual orientation. I will see if I can scan a copy of my agreement and post it. So name one place please.

Responding to the post claiming no gay discrimination and citing a nebulous Georgia law:

Again, if you can't understand plain language, it is your falult not mine, discrimination is legal against gays everywhere in the US that doesn't have a state or local ordinance prohibiting it. And gays are being denied marital rights everywhere but Massacusetts. If you want to list all the states and localities that have ordinances, kindly do so, the burden of proof is on you. With that in mind, please post a link to the Georgia State Statute banning discrimination in employment and housing against gays, lesbians, bisexual and transgendered persons.

Georgia Non-Discrimination Law:

Again research the Georgia Statutes and prove me wrong, it is not up to me to prove a negative although I jsut did. BTW I live in Florida, there is no statewide protections for GLBT here either. Again, if you want to do the research, be my guest but GLBT discrimination is legal in most places in the US.
 
 
I don't understand how making same sex marriages legal forces churches to recognize such a marriage. For example, the Catholic Church will not marry a couple if one of the individuals have been divorced. The Catholic Church would still consider the original marriage as valid and therefore cannot marry the couple. This couple could still go to the justice of the peace and get married, but the Catholic Church would not recognize the marriage.

What would be the difference between that and same sex marriage?
 
 
There's no place at all for church in this discussion...

You're not willing to accept that the laws on the books already protect you; you want special protection in many forms and places. When it comes to hate crime laws, it is a farce and shouldn't exist. If a gay person beats up a straight person because they are straight, do the hate crime laws protect the straight person? Of a black person beats up a white person because they are white, do hate crime laws protect the white person? No they don't, because we have special interest groups seeking unfair laws against the majority and nothing to inflect punishment on the minorities if they commit the same crimes. It is a shame and it is a perfect example of separate but equal at its worst. Apply all laws to all people or it just isn't fair.
 
 
I believe you are wrong about that Cyclopitichorn. I believe that the church is very central to this discussion as christianityand many other religions are the driving force against gay marriage.

The general population of the US is against gay marriage and right or wrong that's the way it is. Maybe someday that will change, but until that day, if I were gay, I would be fighting for a recognized civil union and forget the marriage issue. It's just a word. Let the zealots have their word, meanwhile, my partner and I would have the rights we desire under the rule of law.

I know from previous discussions that you aren't really against happiness for gays, McG, so it's unsurprising that you take the position that both you and I hold: that marriage/civil unions/whatever it is that grants governmental rights to folks ought to be seperate from the church.

And that is the point of not including the church in the discussion of whether or not marriage should be allowed for gays. It simply has no legal bearing on the rights of the individuals.

Now, as for a discussion as to why people are so homophobic, maybe we should look to the churches...

Some people fail to understand that for other people marriage is a sacrament equal to birth, baptism, communion with God, death. Marriage is a life changing event between themselves, their spouse and their God. To them, gay marriage is an afront to their beliefs. Whether we understand that or not is immaterial. To them gay marriage is simply unspeakable.

So, the question is why should anyone's beliefs be trampled on over a word?

A civil union, if properly constructed under the law, would allow equal rights under a different name. If that requires a definition change for the word marriage, then so be it. Everyone gets what they want.

You would off course abolish marriage completely from legislation, leaving all marriages civil unions in the eyes of the law right? And you would not restrict the rights of any religion, religious denomination, or similar organisation, to marry whoever they wish would you?
 
 
Sheesh, I was just about to agree with McG when my puter mouse flew onto the floor.  

I agree with most of what you just said, McG. The 'problem' is the gay people who believe in God, who go to church regularly, who want God's blessing on their union, who want to be married.

There are some churches that have accepted gays into their community and that are offering marriages, in the church, to their gay congregants. Other churches choose not to. I believe both of those choices are, and should be, at the discretion of the church involved. Separation of church and state. It's a good thing. It once used to be an American touchstone.

It's odd watching the U.S. move more and more toward religious fundamentalism - toward the ways of the Middle East. It's not the country of its founders, who fought against religious interference.

When has that happened?
 
 
When the president states his intention to specifically outlaw gay marriage in the constitution, it is happening.

There are two seperate issues here:

1. Should gay couples be afforded the same rights as straight couples?

2. Should churches change to recognize the changes our society has undergone?

We really need to seperate these two questions in order to reach useful conclusions for either of them. I think everyone can agree that neither should have a single thing to do with the other.

Who here remembers the 1950's? (I wasn't born yet, but my parents grew up then.)

Would you say that the country was more religious then than in the late 60's, early 70's? Amazingly enough, the 50's did not lead to a society filled with Taliban like exclusions on women and minorities. We survived... maybe for the better, maybe for the worse.

Crime rates have certainly been up since, as has drug use and abortion rates. Comparing the status of religion in America today to being like a Taliban regime is completely absurd. It's a tactic. Nothing more. The anti-religious fervor being beaten into the heads of the liberals in our society should give every one in America a moment to pause and think for a moment what it is exactly they are opposing. A belief in God? Is that such a bad thing thing that some people should have a different belief system than you?
 
 
"Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legislative powers of government reach actions only, and not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should 'make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,' thus building a wall of separation between church and State."

People don't want to admit that America is a secular nation, is all...

Here's the thing: Majority rule invariably breeds minority oppression. One cannot consistently run the policies of a country on majority rule without extremely pissing off the minority who is left, and that's no way to govern.

The solution? To be extra careful in the application of laws and governance to be sensitive to the needs of the minority. In this case, the majority of Americans call themselves Christian (though they never act or vote like it); therefore, extra care has to be taken to leave Christianity out of governance in order to accurately represent our society.

This applies to morals, as well; the bible cannot be used as a foundation for the formation of laws based upon morals in our secular society.

Therefore; any law seeking to limit homosexuality (and banning homosexuals from enjoying common human rights is limiting, don't kid yourself) is supporting the majority's desire to oppress the minority (homosexuals), in almost every case based upon religious beliefs/learned beliefs and very rarely upon facts, should not be tolerated if we wish to call ourselves a secular society.

Because ATLANTA is in AMERICA, and America was designed to be a secular, non-religiously governed country. If you consider yourself to be American, you support a secular country. Simple as that.

As your people are fond of saying: If you don't like it, feel free to get the hell out. Normally I'd encourage you to try to change it, but not this time; the last thing the world needs is another idiotically-ran theocracy out there....

Noone is pushing the enlightened and open-minded atmosphere that has brought about America's success on you. If you wish to go back to living in a close-minded, contradictory society without the freedom to think and say what you wish, go ahead and go somewhere else and pray to your god for divine inspiration if you like. Feel free to take the president with you, he'd probably feel a lot more comforatable....

House Passes Pledge Protection Act
By Melanie Hunter

September 23, 2004

(CNSNews.com) - In a vote of 247 to 173, the House Thursday passed a bill that would prevent all courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, from ruling on whether the words "under God" in the Pledge of Allegiance case violate the Constitution.

The Pledge Protection Act, H.R. 2028, was sponsored by Rep. Todd Akin (R-Mo.).

You can't love America and seek to limit people's rights because they are different than you.

America is about inclusiveness, not about shutting out people who are different. To deny happiness to a significant portion of your population is to deny them as countrymen.

Just because you have silly religious superstitions built upon two thousand years of rape, murder, and idiocy, doesn't mean that modern-day people should be denied the right to happiness; the fact that they make you uncomfortable indicates a problem with you, not with them.

 
Why is pushing for gay marriage better than pushing against it?
 

Because giving rights to people is better than taking them away, period. I would challenge you to find instances in history where limiting people's rights has resulted in a better society.

The typical answer to this is 'they aren't limited, they could marry someone of the opposite sex blah blah blah...' is bullsh*t and you know it, so don't even bring it up. This situation is analagous to the civil rights movement; it has become clear that we need to make changes to include ALL members of our society, not just the Christian ones.

The government of the United States is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion.

Awesome! It's great that people are treated like people.

Now, the original premise is that these people (who you admit are people) do NOT have the same exact benefits you do(if you are straight, that is) in that they cannot marry the person they love, legally, or derive a legal bonus from coexisting with said person.

This doesn't actually stop them from DOING any of the things that people dislike them for; just keeps it from being legal, because that would imply approval of their lifestyle, which many are unwilling to do.

If you truly do not discriminate against them, surely you would be a proponent of allowing them to marry(even if it is called something else, but given the same legal status)?

A legal bonus? I need to look into that. Where is mine?

I am not opposed to calling it something else. BUT to me marriage is a religious ceremony between a man and a woman.
 
 
If you are married, you do enjoy protections under the law from testifying; you enjoy the right to property after death; visitation rights in hospitals; family leave rights.

In all, there are something like a thousand different rights conferred upon married people that gays are currently ineligible for.

I don't have a problem with anyone keeping their religious ceremony the way it is; that is your right. But we should have the same legal rights for gays who wish to marry as straight folks, even if they have to call it something else.

Frankly (and thank GOD! for the wisdom of our forefathers), the secular governance of this country doesn't rely upon what YOU want.

Not one single person in this country is pushing gay marriage upon YOU.

What other people do in their private lives is NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

Why do you insist, because of your alleged "Godly" character, that YOU have the right to interfere in other people's private lives and dictate to them whom they may and may not marry?

A truly "Godly" person is loving and tolerant of others.

YOU have demonstrated hate and intolerance of others. That is called "hypocrisy."

A truly "Godly" person would not engage in oppression and deprive others of the same liberties and rights that he himself enjoys.

You have demonstrated that YOU want to oppress others and deprive them of the same liberties that you enjoy simply because you disapprove of them--you find them morally objectionable.

As our courts have repeatedly reminded the people of this great nation: "[Our] obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate its own moral code." Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 850;  Lawrence v. Texas .

When and if you ever overcome ignorance and understand that YOU may not mandate YOUR moral code upon others--when you understand that hate and intolerance of others can never serve as a basis for enacting laws that discriminate against the hated group--then maybe you can call yourself "Godly."

Helpful Hints for the Conservative Christian
 Helpful Hints for the Conservative Christian  :

Winning the Same-Sex Marriage Argument in Six Easy Steps

 
Let's admit it, my fellow conservative Christians: right now, we're losing the national argument about same-sex marriage. While we dilly and we dally, those homos are swinging their ding-dongs ever-closer to each other's bungholes under the bond of officially recognized matrimony. What they're up to in Massachussets today, they'll be doing in Mississippi tomorrow.

So it's time to get serious about how we engage in public arguments about same-sex marriage. With the forces for letting people love each other willy-nilly winning the hearts and minds of the American people, we can't afford to engage in on-the-spot original thinking here. It's time to get with the program! Ditch the radical honesty when talking with those same-sexers, people. Jesus tried it and look where it got him. Instead, I strongly urge you to practice ahead of time and have your zingers at the ready when some agent of the Twinkie Police tries shoving facts, logic, and constitutional passages down your throat.

In order to be maximally helpful, I've drawn up the following tips for you to use when arguing with Local Chapter 69 of the Sapphic Love Alliance. Don't think on your feet! Be prepared with the following argumentative tactics:

1. Same-Sex Marriages Hurt My Marriage. Those queers will say anything to win an argument, like "Why shouldn't people be free to do what they want, so long as it doesn't hurt anybody else?"

When they try this line, your first line of response should be that same-sex marriages ARE hurtful. How, you may ask? Well, first of all they are hurtful to marriages between men and women. Tell them you know of at least six married couples who have gotten divorced as a direct result of some guy, somewhere, getting married to some other guy. The typical lesbo queenie will ask you to identify who the particular man-woman married couples are who have gotten divorced because same-sex marriages came to pass. At this point, I suggest you use the line that has worked for so many lonely teenagers: "Well, you wouldn't know them. They live in Missouri." Whatever you do, don't let your opponent know that you don't actually know of any marriages that have dissolved because some same-sex couple got married somewhere else. The point is that we all know that it must be true, so that justifies you filling in the details a little bit.

If the butch dykes snicker condescendingly at this line, use your backup:

2. "What about the Children?" Yes, that's right, CHILDREN are hurt by same-sex marriage. We all know that the kids of same-sex couples turn out funny. Never mind that according to a statement by the American Academy of Pediatrics, "a considerable body of professional literature provides evidence that children with parents who are homosexual can have the same advantages and the same expectations for health, adjustment, and development as can children whose parents are heterosexual." What do doctors know, anyway? Pediatricians are probably all a bunch of queer lovers, anyway, so we know that they're, um, biased. That's right, biased! We just know in our hearts that same-sex marriage hurts the kiddies, so it must be true. Kind of like how George W. knew in his heart that Vlad Putin was a good guy. You know what I mean.

Once you've got them off balance, move on by making reference to...

3. The Holy Bible. It's important to point out that you, personally speaking, have nothing against faggots and dykes. If it were up to you, you say, Boris could lick Barry's bunghole with abandon! Try not to sneer as you say this: the appearance of sincerity is crucial here. As you finish this thought, raise your eyes skyward, turn your palms outward and upward and utter the following words with a lilt: "But the matter is not in my hands. It is only in His."

Yes, it's true. We conservative Christians would be all for gay love, gay rights and gay marriage -- but, darn it to H-E-Double Toothpicks, the Bible just won't let us go there. You see, Leviticus 18:22 lays it out perfectly clearly:

"You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination."

Well, that makes it pretty clear, doesn't it? Oh, well, the Bible tells us to cast out those who engage in such acts (Leviticus 18:29), so we've got to do it. Sorry, but God says so. Really and truly, that's the only reason we're against same-sex marriage. It's a Bible thing, not a hate thing. Finish up your remarks by lowering your gaze to directly meet theirs, and then asking, "You aren't bashing Christianity, are you?"

Most people will stop right there. Who wants to "bash" anything? No, they will agree, certainly you have the right to practice your religion, which as everyone knows includes the "right" to pass laws so that everyone else has to follow your religion, too.

The other reason most people will tend to stop at that point is that most people have not actually read the Bible. This is to your advantage, as you may pick and choose Biblical text that seems to support your point of view. But every once in a while, some clever twit who has actually read the Bible will point out one of two things:

The Bible only prohibits male-male homosexuality. Girl-girl action is apparently OK by Yahweh. So why can't women marry women?
Leviticus 18:19, right next to Leviticus 18:22, says that "Also you shall not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness during her menstrual impurity," and goes on to say that those who have sex with menstruating women shall be cast out of their communities (Leviticus 18:29), just as those engaging in boy-boy action should be cast out. So, they will say, where is the national outcry of conservative Christians against menstrual sex? Where is the constitutional amendment to make menstrual sex unconstitutional?

Be careful when people ask these questions, dear friend. They are clearly under the thrall of Satan, who is occupying their very throats in order to ask these "innocent" questions. What you do next depends on your circumstances. If you are near a phone, call the nearest priest and summon them to perform an exorcism. Then hang up the phone and, until that priest arrives, cover your ears and say "NANANANANANANANANANA I CAN'T HEAR YOU!" very loudly. Don't worry about looking stupid -- your soul is in danger!

If there is no phone nearby, you'll have to handle this dangerous situation all by yourself. Take a deep breath before proceeding. To answer the first question, simply assert the contrary: the Bible DOES prohibit lesbian sex! Really, it does! If your demonic opponent asks you to identify the passage doing so, cite Leviticus 18:18. Although the visible text of Leviticus 18:18 does not at first glance appear to prohibit women having sex with women, if you look close enough with a magnifying glass you can see very very tiny text reading, "and none of that girl-girl action saith the Lord!" If your demonic opponent says such text isn't visible even with a magnifying glass, respond that she or he needs a larger magnifying glass. Repeat this last claim as necessary.

On the second point, you can assure your conversational adversary that there are indeeed conservative Christians mobilizing against the abomination of menstrual sex. See, for instance, the religious opinion of the Density Church and of Landover Baptist Church. Most of the rest of us have our hands full taking care of the homos. Assure your opponent that we will come after the menstruating women next, assuming that the Homosexual Agenda does not prevail over our own.

What's that? Did I say "Homosexual Agenda?"

4. Homosexual Agenda. That's right, Homo Americanus has an agenda! You know and I know that they meet in their unique habitat, the latte bar, to plot their next moves to make the rest of us look stupid. How dare they want things! How dare they have a plan! Tell your opponent you know all about "that Homosexual Agenda," and slap a sly wink on your face to indicate that you know what you mean, and you know your opponent knows you know what you mean, you know what I mean?

Now, at this point, the clever and wily Homosexual might ask what this "Homosexual Agenda" is, and what might be so bad about it anyway. Whatever you do, do NOT respond to this question with specific aims of the queer lobby like freedom to love, freedom of association and stuff like that. When you say "freedom" next to "homo," you'll make them all look like patriots or normal Americans or something -- bad idea. Instead, just wink again and make reference to "Special Rights." It's not like everybody ELSE gets to marry whomever they want -- I, for instance, got stuck with my Martha when I got her pregnant back in '56. But no, the queers just don't know their bounds, pushing for their "Special Rights." This puts the perverts back in their place -- what do they think they are, "special?" How arrogant! How offensively aggressive! And this brings us to our next point:

5. The Homos are the Aggressors. One of the sneakiest tricks employed by the gay and lesbian conspiracy is to make it look like they're the aggrieved party here. And the liberal media has bought it, too, wringing its hands and crying about how they're being prevented from living their lives the way they want to. Well, boo hoo, ya fairies, go cry on somebody else's shoulder, because I'm not buying it -- and neither should you.

The truth is, when the gay boys try to marry each other, they're the ones who are being aggressive. Why, they're shoving their lifestyles down your throat! They're FORCING you to look at them when they hold hands on the street. They're FORCING you to walk around just knowing that in some bedroom somewhere, two men are rubbing their whiskers together despite the itchiness of it all. They're FORCING you to consider Ernie and Bert's relationship in a disturbing new light. They're FORCING you to imagine the thought of two naked women slathering themselves in baby oil and rubbing up and down each others' bodies before langourously taking each others' swollen nipples into their mouths... ahem. To complete the thought, they're FORCING you to contemplate how some people may not want to have marriages identical like yours. No freedom-loving American can permit people to enter into committed relationships at will! No, Liberty demands that these perverts just go back in the closet so we all can continue pretending they don't exist.

The Homosexuals are the Aggressors. And that makes you the Victim.

6. You Are the Victim. That's right, you're the victim in all this. You have been forced -- nay, COMPELLED -- to tolerate other people doing something you don't like. Not only that, but your freedom of religion has been violated, too! When those gay rights activists try to legalize same-sex marriage, they're stomping all over your Constitutional right to have conservative Christian principles enforced by our government and the police. How intolerant. If the lesbian lobby really respected our rights as conservative Christians, they would let us continue to restrict their choices. But they won't do that -- what haters they are! And how beset we are!

If your conversational opponent is not swayed by any of these points, and continues to tell you that you are the one trying to force other people to live their lives according to your beliefs, it's time to pull out the trump card of victimhood. Just do the following:

Take a deep breath.

Allow a tear to trickle down your cheek.

Look down at the ground, injured.

Wail "How can you SAY that?" very loudly and at a high pitch.

Good. Now, when everyone within a twenty-foot radius is looking at you, trot out one of the following phrases:

"Looks like I'm the only one not entitled to my opinion and beliefs."
"Apparently, MY right to free speech stops when it comes to speaking out against gay marriage!"
"Why is everybody censoring me?"
"I never expected to be hated this much for my beliefs."
"Religious people always get bashed like this. What happened to religious freedom?"
"I feel very uncomfortable with your hateful attitude."

Most liberal types can't handle the idea that they've made anybody else cry. So as you cry and tremble in the pose of victimhood they'll drop their positions, try to meet you halfway, utter phrases like "well, I'm sure your position has its merits," and do whatever they can to make you feel better. Milk this. Sniffle under your breath, "well, I'm glad to hear you respect my position," then before they can respond shuffle out of the room, voicing muffled sobs. The next time you meet, you are entitled to misrepresent your adversary's effort at emotional comfort as agreement regarding the legitimacy of prohibiting same-sex marriages. If your adversary tries to state otherwise, accuse them of "returning to hate," turn on your heel, and depart quickly, uttering "how disappointing" over your shoulder.

Carried out individually, using these six points in conversation may provoke ridicule. But if enough of us adopt this strategy, then we'll all look good. Remember, only you stand in the way of gays' and lesbians' matrimonial happiness. Be strong, and good luck.

What the he!! is "wordly"?

Is it a typo for something, or a term meaning something? Sorry canshot, but I really don't know what you mean. And I don't want to assume/presume an interpretation.
 

It is a word. Basically worldly is Christianspeak for rooted in reality. The pesky worldly people tend to be more concerned with cause and effect, logic, reason, rights and such then they are about what it says in the bible.

A worldly person might for instance insist that clouds are condensed vapor even though the bible clearly states that clouds are dust from gods sandals.
 
 
I wonder does Bush consider himself "Godly" or "God like"?  
 
 
Everyones invited to my house this weekend....Friday night we're going downtown and hide in the alley and beat he shit out of all the gays coming out of Legends.....then it's off to the International House Of Pancakes for an after hours breakfast and some table to table face to face gay bashing.

Saturday morning proves to be even more exciting, after a group breakfast where we'll recount the previous night's activities.....it's up the road to kick the shit out of my grandmother's bridge club.....

Sunday morning of course we will head to church and pray for the wisdom and grace to be more Christ like in our daily walk.....
 
 
Godliness is almost next to Cleanliness

 
[invitation for delightful weekend of gay bashing and a$$ kicking.]

Sunday morning of course we will head to church and pray for the wisdom and grace to be more Christ like in our daily walk.....
 

Sounds like fun. On Monday morning, of course, I will have to get back to my letter-writing campaign to all my elected representatives demanding (as it is my right to do) that they pass laws so that everyone else has to follow the teachings of my religion. We have to restrict other people's choices in their private lives because that's what God wants...

Thank you Beth, you are one of the few. Worldly is being out in the world, free of restraint, or religion, living by few or no rules etc. IMO

ok, so it was a typo.

Interesting perception of worldly as well.
 
 
"Worldly" is a term commonly used by the Jehovah's Witnesses that I know to describe someone who doesn't follow the strict path laid out by said religion.

Is that accurate in this case?

According to the bible, women should be socially isolated while menstruating and parents should kill there children if they whorship any other God other than the Christian God. Also, according to the bible, men should not sleep with other men as if they are a women. Perhaps all of these things were meant to be taken literally in a historical context. Centuries ago, when Christanity was forming as a religion, the need to reproduce (so that there are more christians...hence, Christians would have more power to protect themselves against oppression) Stating that the bible says it's against the word of God, well....you're either going to have to face the fact that certain aspects of the bible were written in a historical context, or you will have to kill your children if they decide to whorshop another god or gods....(and not be christian).

Actually, I think for some reason, people who are against same sex marriage are scared. Very scared. I'm sorry my desire to have a normal life scares all of you. Yes, I am gay, and I have tried numerous times to be with men, but it just doesnt work. For me, the emotional aspect isn't there with men. I never knew what a crush was until I admitted to myself about my feelings. And I found out, oh...that makes me gay. I'm actually pretty lucky, because it wasn't as hard for me to admit it to myself. I have a friend who is going through a really hard time, because he'd rather be with a women (since it's normal and socially acceptable) but has no feelings for them. Somtimes he gets really depressed over it and wishes that he could be "normal". Actually, me too. It would make life easier if I could be straight, but I have tried so many times and it doesnt work. It's not somthing we choose. (nor is being straight somthing you choose, for that matter. MAybe that scares you too? Knowing that you could have been gay instead of straight?)
I am not even Christian, actually. To be honest, I have trouble believing in a religion that is so intolerant of others. I dont think it has to be that way. I dont think that that means Christanity at its core is false, but some of the people are misguided and scared. (some churches, believe it or not, accept homosexual peoples). It's very likely that this fear of homosexuality is also at the core of the whole Priest scandal. Imagine this: You are homosexual. No matter how much you try to be with and like people of the opposite sex, it doesnt work. You may try even for years and years. Your faith tells you that you are going to hell. That you are going against God's will. To make up for it, you try to reform yourself and become a priest. You repress your feelings entirely. Total repression. (or if you don't believe in that, then total denial. You may have homosexual thought, but within a fraction of a second after first expereincing it, you deny it, rationalize it away. But, after years of repressing/denying it, finally your feelings burst out. ANd you do somthing that is very very wrong, you become almost impulsive because you have repressed/denied your feelings for so long. You hurt another human being, rape them. Men are stronger than boys, so boys are the easiet and most likely target. You tarnish the church, you ruin your congregation, and now you KNOW you are going to hell (even non-christian relgions would say you'd go to hell for that). But they were trying to be a good Christian....a priest in fact. While that doesnt make such actions right (molesting or hurting a child is NEVER EVER right.) the fact is, it only occured because you repressed or denied it. Refused to admit to yourself that you are attracted to people of the same sex and its not somthing you can control. TO deny it furthur risks a sort of, eventual erruption of emotions and feelings. So I suggest, seriously, honestly.... be tolerant of homosexual people in your church.... and you'd prevent this sort of thing from happening. People don't choose to be gay. I know I never did. It just is. People just are. Just like some people are black, some are white, others have brown or blond or black hair. If Jesus teaches compassion, then express that compassion. If you want to walk to the other side of the street whenever you see a gay couple holding hands...if you dont want to be friends with us, or be near us, thats fine. There are plenty of people in this world who accept us for who we are. But just please don't deny us the chance to be ourselves. (in which an amendment to the consitution would do)We are just like you, except that we have crushes and fall in love with people of the same sex. That is all. Please be compassionate. Please be understanding.
 
 
Well said SAB
 
 
Most people who voted against homosexual marriage were not voicing a vote against the lifestyle. I know I do not care how one lives their lives. Nor do I believe ANYONE should be discriminated against. Therefore I would favor civil unions to provide the same financial benefits for homosexuals as for hetrosexuals.

However, I would be AGAINST homosexual marriage. There are certain traditions that lay at the foundation of any civilization. One of them I believe is to maintain MARRIAGE as a UNION between ONE man and ONE woman. This tradition must remain a in order to promote procreation and a continuance of society. The Mormans had a difficult time joining this union until they changed their traditions to adopt to the American Way.

The fact that most homosexuals will regard the above statement as homophobic demonstrates a narrowmind approach to the real issue which is NOT marriage, but the benefits provided.
 
 
SAB - just to let you know it is not Christianity that are intolerant or non-accepting of homosexuals, but many Christian Churches. There are some Christian Churches that not only accept homosexuals, but have homosexual ministers.
