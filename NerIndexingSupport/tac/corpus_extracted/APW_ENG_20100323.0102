Minnesota Twins catcher Joe Mauer became one of baseball's highest-paid players when he signed an $184 million, eight-year contract extension on Monday.

The 26-year-old Mauer even used the same pen he signed his rookie contract with in 2001, when the Twins made him the No. 1 pick in the draft.

The new deal should make Mauer a fixture with his hometown team through 2018.

Flanked by his agents, Ron Shapiro and Michael Maas to his right and Twins general manager Bill Smith and team president Dave St. Peter to his left, Mauer said one word immediately after signing.

"Wow."

"There are a lot of people in this room who I care a lot about," Mauer said. "I'm kind of getting emotional. There are a lot of people who helped me get to this point."

Mauer's parents, Jake Mauer II and Teresa Mauer, were sitting in the front row of the news conference. So were Joe's older brothers, Bill and Jake Mauer III, who, like Joe, both played in the minor leagues for the Twins.

Jake Mauer III enters his first season as manager of the Class A Fort Myers Miracle.

"They've been here for me my whole life," Joe Mauer said. "I wouldn't be here without them."

He said although he remained serious in getting a favorable deal, he never wanted to leave for another team in another city.

Mauer hit .365 with a career-best 28 home runs and 96 RBI last season after beginning the year on the disabled list while recovering from a back injury. He went on to win his second Gold Glove Award, his third American League batting title and his first Most Valuable Player Award.

"I love putting on a Minnesota Twins uniform," Mauer said. "It's a real thrill to be able to do this for the rest of my career. I have to tell everybody here I'll give you everything I've got. My ultimate goal is to win a World Series. I'm looking forward to doing that. Thank you for coming, and let's get back to work tomorrow, eh?"

"I had hoped that we would get to this stage," Twins owner Jim Pohlad said. "We had high hopes. This was such a unique opportunity. He's a hometown, MVP. We're really happy to have him."

The contract extension prevents the free-spending Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees from entering a bidding war for Mauer. He would have become a free agent after this season.
