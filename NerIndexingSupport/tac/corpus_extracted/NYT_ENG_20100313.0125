A young mother, detained in connection with a
terrorist conspiracy to kill a Swedish cartoonist, was lonely in
her new high-altitude town and craved attention and new
friendships, family members say.

Jamie Paulin-Ramirez, 31 -- questioned in Ireland for several
days before reportedly being released Saturday -- found new friends
online as she began corresponding with a group of Muslims
including, her family says, Colleen R. LaRose, 46, known as "Jihad
Jane," and admitted terrorist conspirator and former DIA
shuttle-bus driver Najibullah Zazi.

"She couldn't do anything that would make people take notice,"
said her stepfather, George Mott, 51, himself a Muslim for more
than 40 years. "Then she became a Muslim. Here was this blond,
blue-eyed woman wearing a burqa. She knew everybody was going to
want to know why."

Though she never understood her new religion in any depth, she
risked her future in support of extremist causes, Mott said.

Paulin-Ramirez was detained last week in Waterford, Ireland,
with five others in a plot to kill Swedish cartoonist Lars Vilks.
The artist had incited Muslims with his parody cartoons of the
Prophet Muhammad.

Irish police spokesman Tony Connaughton said Saturday that four
people were released after talking with investigators while in
custody.

The Associated Press reported that Paulin-Ramirez had been
released, but Connaughton wouldn't confirm that.

Connaughton also wouldn't say whether Paulin-Ramirez's son,
6-year-old Christian Carreon, was with authorities.

Irish law allows people to be held for seven days without
charges. If the public prosecutor finds cause, those released can
be rearrested. Connaughton acknowledged that was unlikely in this
case, because once released, the non-Irish nationals would probably
leave the country.

Paulin-Ramirez's mother, Christine Mott, and George Mott said
their primary concern is for the welfare of Christian, who on
Monday told his grandmother he has a sword and had recently learned
how to fire a gun.

"She has put him in an environment that could get him killed,"
Christine Mott said Saturday while sobbing uncontrollably. "He was
being taught to shoot guns."

A tangled life, then stability

Paulin-Ramirez was raised in a broken home and is bipolar,
Christine said. She lost contact with her daughter for six years
during her teen years.

In 2001, Paulin-Ramirez came to live with her mother in Denver
after marriages to an abuser and an illegal immigrant. By then, the
Motts had married and George Mott was in and out of jail, primarily
on drug charges.

Paulin-Ramirez spent a lot of time cruising Federal Boulevard in
Denver and identified with Mexican gangs, her mother said.
Paulin-Ramirez colored her hair purple.

"She wore short skirts and tight jeans," Christine said. "She
was very wild."

Christian's father, Paulin-Ramirez's third husband, was
repeatedly deported to Mexico.

Paulin-Ramirez moved to San Diego and in 2003 was caught up with
a group of coyotes who smuggled illegal immigrants into the United
States, according to George Mott.

Paulin-Ramirez moved back to Colorado and enrolled in college.
She got straight A's in school, her mother said.

She earned an associate's degree in spring 2007 but couldn't
find a job in the Denver area.

Instead, she found one at Eagle Care Clinic in Edwards, an
office that primarily serves the poor and uninsured. She worked
there for more than two years, said Dr. Kent Petrie, the clinic's
medical director, and

was an "excellent and dedicated" employee.

Christine Mott, who is on disability, moved to the Leadville
area shortly after her daughter did so she could help care for
Christian.

Paulin-Ramirez worked as a medical assistant, setting up rooms
and helping patients. Last fall, Petrie and some of the other
office staff noticed she had started talking more about Islam and
covering her head with a shawl.

"She wasn't trying to convert us or anything, but it was a
rapid transition," Petrie said. "It was kind of a surprise to us.

She was never distracted, wearing the head coverings, the
shawls."

The Motts also said Paulin- Ramirez's conversion to Islam was
sudden. She had never been affiliated with a particular faith
before. She started visiting Muslim websites and corresponding with
Muslims on Internet chat rooms.

On Easter week last year, Paulin-

Ramirez announced she was Muslim. She told her mother she would
never wear a burqa, which covers most of the face and body. Then
one day, the young woman began wearing a hijab, a scarf worn over
the hair and neck. In the coming weeks, she would buy elaborate
hijabs.

"She wouldn't buy food for her baby, but she bought the
scarves," said Christine Mott as she took some of the head
coverings out of a plastic bag and draped them on a coffee table.

Soon after buying the hijabs, Paulin-Ramirez began wearing a
burqa.

She tried to convert her mother to Islam, Christine said.
Paulin-Ramirez also began corresponding regularly with a Middle
Eastern man named Ali.

Petrie, her boss, said he knew there was a man in
Paulin-Ramirez's life, and that she was corresponding frequently
with him on the Internet.

"I'm not sure if it was a romantic interest or someone who was
more of a leader in her life," he said.

She was, the family discovered, corresponding with suspected
terrorists including Jihad Jane and Zazi, the airport-shuttle
driver who recently admitted his part in a plot to bomb the New
York City subway system.

"We're just, 'Oh, boy,' " George Mott said of his reaction to
that news.

Christine Mott said her daughter refused to listen to reason
about her questionable correspondents, even after one told her he
wanted to come to the U.S. and get a pilot's license.

"That was a red flag," her mother said.

George Mott forbade Paulin-Ramirez to use his computer, worrying
that the FBI would discover her interest and they would all be
arrested.

She told her mother she was going to Denver on Sept. 11. She
left her car at Denver International Airport and flew to New York
City.

Petrie said the woman gave no notice. Staffers called the police
to report that she hadn't shown up for work.

"We've all been very concerned about her," Petrie said.
"We've been trying to get more information about her, and we never
have been able to."

Christine Mott said her daughter left a bag of her scarves and
$300 behind. She filed a missing person's report Sept. 15. Her
daughter finally called a month later from Ireland.

Sgt. Saige Thomas of the Leadville police said it was apparent
that something was wrong, but in the end, Paulin-Ramirez is an
adult -- and there was no evidence of foul play.

Christine Mott called the FBI agent who had investigated her
daughter's involvement in an illegal-immigrant smuggling case.
George Mott gave the computer Paulin-Ramirez had used to the FBI
agent to analyze.

On Monday of last week, Paulin-Ramirez called from Ireland. But
George Mott said mother and daughter haven't been able to speak for
five minutes without getting into a screaming match since
Paulin-Ramirez became a Muslim, and that Paulin-Ramirez almost
immediately gave the phone to her son. That is when Christian said
his name had been changed to Wahid.

The boy asked them to give a black-and-white kitten his old
name, Christian. He said he was being taught how to shoot guns, the
family said.

"He said all Christians will burn in hell and that Christians
will be punished," Christine Mott said.

She said even if her daughter is released, her grandson remains
in grave danger. She hopes to gain custody of the child but lacks
the money to hire an attorney. As of 5 p.m. Saturday, the family
had not received any official news.

"If she thinks she's out scot-free, is she going to go back to
those people and put that baby in the same situation?" she said.
"Even if they can't prove it, these people are terrorists and that
baby is still in danger."
