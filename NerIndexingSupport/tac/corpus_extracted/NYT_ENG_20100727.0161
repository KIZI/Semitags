Jack Tatum, the former Oakland Raiders player who earned the
nickname the Assassin for his brutal hits, none of them more
devastating than a blow that left New England Patriots wide
receiver Darryl Stingley paralyzed in 1978, died Tuesday in
Oakland, Calif. He was 61.

The Raiders announced his death on their website. The cause was
a heart attack, Tatum's friend and former Ohio State teammate John
Hicks told The Associated Press. Tatum had suffered from diabetes
in recent years, leading to the amputation of a leg.

Tatum played 10 seasons in the National Football League and won
a Super Bowl ring in 1977 with the Raiders, whose outlaw image was
enhanced by Tatum's ferocious style of play.

Tatum, a three-time Pro Bowl selection, was one of the most
feared hitters in football, and he came to be a symbol of a violent
game. "I like to believe that my best hits border on felonious
assault," he wrote in a 1980 book, "They Call Me Assassin."

His collision with Stingley, one of the most indelible in NFL
history, defined Tatum's reputation. It came on Aug. 12, 1978, in a
preseason game against the Patriots at Oakland Coliseum. Stingley
was running a crossing pattern, and the force of the hit fractured
two vertebrae in Stingley's neck and severely damaged his spinal
cord, leaving him a quadriplegic.

No penalty flags were thrown and Tatum was not disciplined -- but
Stingley and Tatum never reconciled. Tatum did not apologize for
the hit, earning him considerable national scorn.

"It was tough on him, too," Hicks told The AP. "He wasn't the
same person after that. For years he was almost a recluse."

In his 1980 book, Tatum wrote: "When the reality of Stingley's
injury hit me with its full impact, I was shattered. To think that
my tackle broke another man's neck and killed his future."

In 1996, Tatum and Stingley were supposed to meet for a
television appearance, but Stingley called it off after being told
it was to publicize a book written by Tatum. Stingley died in 2007
at the age of 55.

"It's not so much that Darryl doesn't want to, but it's the
people around him," Tatum told The Oakland Tribune in 2004. "So
we haven't been able to get through that. Every time we plan
something, it gets messed up. Getting to him or him getting back to
me, it never happens."

Tatum was involved in a number of plays that have become
enshrined in NFL history. In the 1977 Super Bowl against the
Minnesota Vikings, he hit Vikings wide receiver Sammy White so hard
that White's helmet flew off, a play immortalized on highlight
reels.

And it was Tatum's hit on Pittsburgh receiver Frenchy Fuqua in a
1972 playoff game that sent a Terry Bradshaw pass ricocheting into
the arms of Franco Harris, who ran the ball in for the winning
Steelers touchdown, a play christened the Immaculate Reception.

John David Tatum was born on Nov. 18, 1948, in Cherryville,
N.C., and grew up in Passaic, N.J., where he did not start playing
football until he was at Passaic High School. He was such a gifted
athlete that Ohio State Coach Woody Hayes recruited him as a
running back before he was moved to defensive back -- partly at the
behest of the assistant coach Lou Holtz -- where he became a
two-time all-American, won a national championship in 1968 and was
named the nation's best defensive player in 1970.

Ohio State now gives the Jack Tatum Hit of the Week award to its
football players.

Tatum was drafted 19th over all by the Raiders in 1971, and his
hard-hitting style was obvious from his first NFL appearance. In
that game, against the Baltimore Colts, Tatum knocked out two Colts
tight ends.

Tatum was traded to the Houston Oilers in 1980 and played his
last season with them before retiring at the end of the season.
Afterward he worked in real estate, was a part-owner of a
restaurant and worked to promote diabetes research.

He is survived by his wife, Denise, and their three children.

Besides "They Call Me Assassin," Tatum wrote two other books,
"They Still Call Me Assassin: Here We Go Again" (1989) and
"Final Confessions of an NFL Assassin" (1996).

"I was paid to hit, the harder the better," he wrote in the
final book. He added: "I understand why Darryl is considered the
victim. But I'll never understand why some people look at me as the
villain."
