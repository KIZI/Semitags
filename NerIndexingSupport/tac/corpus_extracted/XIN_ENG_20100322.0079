Pakistani government filed a petition on Monday in eastern city Lahore's High
Court for granting permission to question nuclear scientist Dr. Abdul Qadeer
Khan regarding his interview with media.

The government in its petition stated that A.Q Khan has revealed national
secrets in his recent interview with an American daily Washington Post.

The government has pleaded to the court to grant permission for questioning the
nuclear scientist.

Another government plea requesting ban over interviews and meetings with Qadeer
is already under the court hearing, which was likely to be decided Monday.

The Washington Post recently in a report claimed that A.Q Khan states, in the
documents obtained by the daily, that Pakistan gave Iran bomb-related drawings,
parts for centrifuges to purify uranium and a secret worldwide list of
suppliers, in lieu of weapons.

"It is yet another repackaging of fiction, which surface occasionally for
purposes that are self-evident," said Abdul Basit, Pakistani Foreign Office
spokesman on March 15.

A.Q Khan is a closed chapter, the spokesman said, adding that Pakistan's non-
proliferation credentials are second to none and its export controls are
foolproof.
