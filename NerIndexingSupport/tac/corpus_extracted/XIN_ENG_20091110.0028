Syrian President Bashar al-Assad sent a message Tuesday to congratulate his
Lebanese counterpart Michel Suleiman on Lebanon's formation of a new national
unity government, the official SANA news agency reported.

In his congratulation cable, President al-Assad expressed hope that "this stage
would be good and would serve the Lebanese republic and the brotherly Lebanese
people," SANA said.

Lebanese new Prime Minister Saad Hariri announced the formation of Lebanon's new
cabinet on Monday night, bringing an end to the five-month cabinet impasse
following the June parliamentary elections.

Although Syria had withdrawn its troops from the neighboring country in April
2005, Damascus still has big influence in Lebanon by supporting the Hezbollah-
dominant March 8 Alliance opposition.

Many inside and outside Lebanese blamed Syria for involving in the 2005
assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri. However, Damascus
denies it had anything to do with Hariri 's murder.
