Since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Nawar Shora, the legal director for
the Arab American Anti-Discrimination Committee, has sparred with the federal
government over what he saw as security abuses against minorities. Now, he is
joining the Transportation Security Administration as a senior adviser for its
office of civil rights and liberties.

Shora, 33, said the move next month to the Department of Homeland Security will
back up what he has been telling summer interns for a decade as he urged them to
enter federal service.

"I'm finally practicing what I preach," said Shora, a self-described "Arab
country boy" who was born in Syria and raised in Huntington, W.Va. "It's about
time I cross over to the government and start working within the system. That's
the beauty of our society: Anybody can work with the government."

The move by Shora, who started with the ADC as an intern in 1999 after
graduating from Marshall University and the West Virginia University College of
Law, comes at a challenging time for the TSA and other security agencies.

U.S. law enforcement agencies have confronted a growing number of incidents
since 2009 involving violent "homegrown" extremists and cases in which overseas
terrorist groups have recruited and trained Americans. Separately,
vulnerabilities in international aviation security were exposed in the case of
Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, an alleged al-Qaida operative from Nigeria charged
with trying to blow up a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam to Detroit on
Christmas Day.

In January, the TSA heightened security measures for travelers who are from _ or
traveling through _ 13 predominantly Muslim countries, plus Cuba. Those
procedures drew criticism from Arab, Muslim and South Asian civil liberties
groups, which said the measures were too broad.

"Complaints are going to come in fast and furious" from Americans visiting those
countries during the upcoming peak summer travel months, said James Zogby,
founder of the Arab-American Institute and a longtime Washington civil rights
advocate. "I know no one better equipped to handle them than Nawar."

"All of a sudden, people are labeled as being related to terrorism just because
of the nation they are from," Shora said this winter, calling the TSA move
"extreme and very dangerous."

Federal civil rights offices have for decades tapped a pipeline of talented
young lawyers from private organizations. Shora also has built a decade-long
track record of trying to bridge the differences between law enforcement and
Muslim and Arab-Americans.

Shortly after the 2001 attacks, Shora became a founding member of an Arab,
Muslim and Sikh advisory council set up by the former head of the FBI's
Washington field office, Joseph Persichini. The council aired concerns about
hate crimes, the USA Patriot Act, FBI investigations and other sensitive topics.

Shora made nearly 50 appearances before FBI agents to increase cultural
awareness of Arab and Muslim Americans; appeared in training videos for the
Justice Department Community Relations Service and the DHS Office for Civil
Rights and Civil Liberties in 2003 and 2007; and joined a group organized by the
American Society for Industrial Security International dedicated to security
issues for religious groups including Jews, Muslims and Mormons and other
Christians.

"As a devout Muslim, my mother always taught me you must be a good Jew and a
good Christian," too, said Shora, who met his wife, a French Catholic exchange
student, at law school in West Virginia. "That lesson stayed with me over the
years."

Shora also has written a book, "The Arab American Handbook," which is billed as
an "non-politicized, fun ... quick read."

Shora said he worked with, not for, the FBI, and never on investigations. Still,
he acknowledges that increasing understanding between two camps can be a "lose-
lose" proposition, with some Muslim activists labeling him a "collaborator" and
some law enforcement agents suspicious of an Arab or a Muslim working alongside
them.
