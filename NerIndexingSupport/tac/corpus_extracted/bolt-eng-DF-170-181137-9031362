 
 
Seahawks play for the NFC West title
 
 
at Qwest Stadium.

Should be able to sqeek by the Rams.

Even with Charlie Whitehurst.
 
 
St Louis Rams are no great shakes.

If the Hawks beat them - both wind up 7-9 - andthe hawks win the tie breaker (what is with that - since the Ramsbeat the Hawks 20-3)

whatever

Beat the rams at home - then have a home game playoff game
 
 
The Seahawks are a fine alternative to NFL football.
 
 
Seahawks worse than they look. Rank 28th in the league in total offense with two of their wins in the last seven games over the Carolina Cruds and Arizona Anuerisms. They are a terrible team whom if they somehow won, would embarass the NFL.
 
 
I think the Rams are the better team.....but that's not saying much.
 
 
Didn't Cleveland go to the AFC title game after posting an 8-8 record? Did the Arizona Cardinals go to the SB after posting a 9-7 record?

If either the Rams or the Seahawks win their home playoff game will that shut anyone up?

It will shut a lot of people up....ya...we will all have heart attacks! That's not even a believable tease. I suggest that the fans get really drunk on the way to the game. Maybe even to the point of blacking out.
 
 
As crappy as the Seahawks are playing this year...The worst football game is still better than the best soccor game.

Just sayin..  
 
 
Who wins the division if these two pathetic pitiful teams play to a 0-0 tie? I've seen better high school football teams than that division.
 
 
We're 7 and 9!!! We're 7 and 9!!! We're 7 and 9!!! We're 7 and 9!!! We're 7 and 9!!! We're 7 and 9!!! We're 7 and 9!!! We're 7 and 9!!! We're 7 and 9!!! We're 7 and 9!!! We're 7 and 9!!!

Seahawks are the cream of the crap.
 
 
Way to set the bar, seattle. What an absolute eyesore of a ballgame.

After Seattle won, thousands of birds dropped dead out of the sky. There's gotta be a connection!
 
 
Wanna hear something funny? We actually played NO pretty well in their stadium...losing 34 to 19. Hasselbeck passed for 364 yards..22 for 34. We were in the red zone four times without scoring. Playing in Seattle is a whole different animal. It is the loudest stadium in the NFL. You have to be there to understand what number 12 does to the other team's ability to sustain drives.

If the same defense as last Sunday night shows up this could be a real fight. Our offensive line is healthy for a change and the defensive was awesome last week. I'm not predicting a win but it is definitely not a gimmie for N O by any stretch.

If the Seahawks get a couple of lucky bounces it could be a long day for Orleans...

Just sayin... If you are betting take the OVER....There will be scoring!

HUGGY'S prediction... Seahawks 31.... N O 26

Listen to the dude who always claims that sports is meaningless spitting mad knowledge about sports  
 
 
I see no reason why Seattle can't beat Nawlins, and for that matter anyone else. IF they do three things:

1.) Protect the football. NO turnovers.
2.) COLLECT some turnovers.
3.) Be able to consistently RUN the ball, and stick with it. This will help keep the score LOW by keeping Nawlins' offense on the bench.

Drew Brees is turning into another Farve.

Making all of these grab-bag plays - like a couple in a recent game - forward flips that got returned for TDs.
 
 
The key to the game WILL BE TURNOVERS!!!

In true Cinderella fashion the shape of the football will determine the outcome of the game.

Will the biggest Sunday Sports headlines read 8-9 team advances in playoffs? OR World Champs.. Chimps?

Wrong.

PROTECTING the football, no matter its shape.....
 
 
If Seattle is as sorry as their win Sunday night, NO will annihilate them.

That was our back up QB. Most Seahawk fans couldn't pick him out of a lineup.
 
 
Seattle is 2 wins away from a superbowl appearance. That is fucking crazy!

If they win Saturday I'm not sure this town will know how to deal with it. I bet there isn't one fan planning to go to the SB.

Charlie Whitehurst looks like Jesus.

Maybe that is a good sign.
 
 
Pete Carroll should stop being coy/cute and name Matt Hassellback as the starting QB against the Saints.

Matt H gives the Hawks the best chance to win. Passed for almost 400 yards against the Saints in the regular season.

Is probably around 95% healthy.

All Whitehurst did was manage the game against the crappola Rams. Aside from the one deep pass on the opening drive - which was woefully underthrown -it was all dinks-and-dunks, or taking off to run.

Wise up Pete!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Nope! It is the smart play not announcing. Whitehurst is more mobile than Matt. This way the Aints have to prepare for both on a short week. Two different styles...I like it.

They have to change what they did last time because they were lucky Matt didn't find the end zone four more times in the last meeting. Now our starting left tackle is back on board so it will be even more difficult to prevent Matts passing accuracy. His broken left wrist has had time to mend and his hip strain is not a big deal if he doesn't try to be a hero and run for touchdowns like he did two weeks ago.

I would like to see Charlie and Matt both play. With little time to prepare and not much book on Whitehurst combined with Matt shredding their secondary last outing I see a Seattle advantage. The Key on our offense is how many of our receivers will be healthy. If N O has short safeties they will be fucked trying to out jump Mike Williams on those end zone corner routes. Dude is tall like a strong forward on a basketball team.

Here is the real problem for the Saints. 9 players reported injured. Neither of their running back back ups will play. Bush is it and he is just returning from a broken leg. A couple of good pops on the stilts and his will to run through people will go bye bye. Shockey..will be a no show. Seattle has no player not ready to play. That was not the case when we lost to them in N O.

If we can get to Brees you all may be in for a big surprise.
 
 
Who do we play after we dethrone the defending SB champs?????????????

OK not the Giants...I must have miss read the chart. I wouldn't get too excited about the next round. Haven't played N O yet. I'm pretty sure we play N O next.  
 
 
Carroll agrees. Don't tip hand. No QB announcement.
 
 
Hasselbeck will start.

Seahawks haven't lost a playoff game at home in a LONG time, and in fact have won last four.
 
 
 
Hasselbeck will start.

Of course he will. He has mucho playoff experience. Charlie has none.
 
 
I think, if the Packers and Seahawks both win, Seattle heads to Chi-town.

Not for nothing but Seattle did beat Da Bears in Chicago this year. One of few, if not their only "good" win this year.

Of course getting by the Saints is no small thing. At least it will be cold and a little wet. (suck it Dome pussies)

Seattle needs to win three games to get to the Super Bowl.

Go Seahawks!

Yup this one then two road games.

And again, I know of no reason they cannot pull it off. The player talent in the NFL is comparable, team to team, especially with the playoff teams. There's not much difference at all between the 7-9 team and the 13-3 team. Often it's just a matter of a play here, a play there.
 
 
Except in extreme cases, I think there is a distinct difference between 13-3 and 7-9. Look at the point differentials....the Seahawks gave up almost 100 more than they scored. That's a 300 point difference with the Pats!

I'll grant, in the one-and-done playoffs of the NFL, anything is possible. But the Seahawks (and any other team that could have come out of the horrible NFC West) are a much poorer team than the other playoff contenders.

There's really very little difference in player personnel talent level in today's NFL. That was my point, not stats.

This is why any team can beat any other team at any given time. And the Seahawks aren't as "poor" as the stats and their record indicates.

There's no reason they cannot win tomorrow, and really no reason they cannot win the SB. Vegas odds say NO but, that's why they play the games.
 
 
 
at Qwest Stadium.

Should be able to sqeek by the Rams.

Even with Charlie Whitehurst.

 

First team in history to have a losing record and make the playoffs!

The NFL does so many things right making it by far the best sports league in the world. But they need to change one thing back. 3 divisions per conference and 3 wildcard teams.
 
 
Forecast is for rain/snow mix this afternoon. Good luck with your tiny cold wet hand Brees!

Go Hawks!
 
 
We gotta game fellas! GO NOT THE SAINTS! GO NOT THE SAINTS!
 
 
 
After falling behind 10-0 in the first quarter, the Seahawks have outscored the Saints 31-10 since.

Win or lose, this "7-9, doesn't deserve a playoff game" team is giving the defending SB champs a run for their money. I'm sure all the talking heads who were calling for reseeding are going to be doing some talking gymnastics come monday.
 
 
Hawks got healthy at the right time.

Verses the beat up Saints and at Quest, I just hope they can keep hanging on and get this big big win...
 
 
If the Seahawks blow this, I'm gonna be highly upset.
 
 
this is it, they must hold them...5 minutes left.

They look awful nervous for being in the lead with only 5 minutes left.

Lynch just had the greatest run I've seen all year.
 
 
holy hell!!!!!!!!!!!

The Saints defense has been exposed.

Musta' missed DeSean Jackson in 15 for the win over NYG  
 
 
well let's see, the 7-9 team is not only allowed in but is at home....
 
 
Even though they gave up a TD, what a great stop to prevent the two extra points.
 
 
on side kick coming up...here we go.
 
 
OOOOOOOOOOOVer
 
 
Wow, what a terrible onside kick.  

Game over.
 
 
looks like Pete Carroll picked the right time to get out of the ethically challenged whirlwind, eh?
 
 
 
well let's see, the 7-9 team is not only allowed in but is at home....

 

They are the 8-9 Seahawks now.          

Get well soon Lofa!!

 

Real soon!

Second that "greatest run... all year"! (see link)

Oh when the Saints, go marching home
Oh when the Saints go marching home
Lord did you see Hasselbeck's numbers
When the Saints went marching home

Marching home!
Marching home!
La la la la, la la, la la

             
 
 
See?

I told ya'll so!
 
 
None of this would have been possible if the Rams hadn't beaten the 49ers.

That gave the Seahawks the luxery of losing at Tampa Bay. Then beat the Rams at home.

Best scenerio going forward - Green Bay wins at Philadelphia, which means the Hawks play at Chicago - where they won earlier this season.

Highly possible the Hawks could host the NFC title game against the Packers.

Maybe the most awesome game sealing 67 yard run from scrimmage in playoff history!!!!!

This one was for the ages!!! HE WAS NOT TO BE DENIED!!!!!!!!!!!!

           
 
 
I commend Lynch for having the awareness to grab his nuts at the absolute pinnacle of his life.
 
 
Lynch's stiffarm is all-time highlight reel material, turning what was just another run of the mill horrible tackling display into an instant classic.

Without the bionic stiffarm, this was just typical Nawlins defensive football.

Moved up to Al Michaels/Cris Collingsworth for the Rams game - and the Notre Dame (Tom Hammond/Mike M) crew for the Saints game..
