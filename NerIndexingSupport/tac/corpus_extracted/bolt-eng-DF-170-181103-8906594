 The Palin Implosion - Yahoo! News 

 
NEW YORK  Sarah Palin has gone from the most divisive figure in politics to the most polarizing within the GOP. John Avlon on the polls that show her path to the nomination keeps getting steeper.

Call off the coronationthe medias caught on to the slow motion implosion of Sarah Palins popularity, and with it her prospective presidential campaign.
A new Washington Post/ABC News poll found that Palins approval ratings among Republicans had declined by double digits since October, while her strongly unfavorable rating reached 17 percent among the GOP and 28 percent among Republican-leaning independents. This shift in the conservative populist tide provoked a series of memorable (and frankly enviable) headlines like The Incredible Shrinking Sarah Palin from Politico and other outlets.

But the real story is the continued erosion of support for Sarah Palin. By the end of her three-month stint as John McCains VP nominee, 59 percent of American voters believed that Sarah Palin was not ready for the job, and 47 percent of self-described centrists said they were actually less likely to vote for McCain because of Palins presence on the ticket.

There was no doubt that she was beloved by the conservative base, but one year after the election, with Palin acting as voice of the opposition, 63 percent of Americans already said that they would not seriously consider her for president.

By April 2010, even 47 percent of Tea Party supporters said that Sarah Palin would not have the ability to be an effective presidentwhile only 40 percent believed she would. At the height of Tea Party enthusiasm, Palins conservative populist base was saying thanks, but no thanks to a prospective presidential campaign. It was a judgment call by the people who knew her best..

 

Gift wrapped present for CG and Stephanie, the rest of the Palin loving Repugs wipe your arses.
 
 
 
 
 
Palin is a never-was who is also a never-will-be. Her sole claim to fame is that she was selected to be the VP Candidate for one of the worst POTUS nominees in the history of the Republican Party and proceeded to help her running mate drive their campaign into the ground. She's a Liberal and a Hypocrite. That the Republican Party would even consider her as a potential candidate is a farce. That any Conservative would even consider supporting her in any way is even more laughable.
 
 
It has been weeks since we saw a Palin thread. Now five in a day. Those who enjoy Palin thread rejoice while you can. She is now headed into the sunset.

Since Palin isn't running for anything I really can't see where anyone would give a shit there Fail&GO.

However, if it makes you happy then by all means carry on. LOL
 
 
Sarah Palin is a gift wrapped distraction to keep liberals eyes off the real ball.
 
 
As usual, Fail&Won'tGo doesn't get his fucking facts straight. I'm not a Palin supporter. Clearly, it's not Fail&Won'tGo's turn for the brain cell today.

Stupid, lyin' little shit.
 
 
Sarah is making a ton of money and would be a fool to run for the presidency. Most people feel that she is not qualified anyway. She's still a good looking woman though.
 
 
 
...... She's still a good looking woman though.

 

Which has exactly WHAT to do with her qualifications to be a political candidate? Beautiful or ugly have nothing to do with it.

Yep.... intelligent conservatives view her as a 'useful idiot'. I'm not quite sure what word we would use to describe Fail&Won'tGo.... Idiot, sure... but what descriptor? That's the puzzle.... he's clearly not 'useful'.... perhaps 'embarrassing idiot'?

The left wants to insist how unpopular she is, yet they are the very ones who consistently want to bring her back out into the spotlight for more media exposure. The more they complain, the bigger the platform they give to her.
 
 
I really dont think people on the right were ever that obsessed with Palin. But please keep attacking her Flaylo. That way our real candidate, whomever he may be, will beat you guys without you paying attention.
 
 
I cant understand the lefts fascination with ol Sarah. She hasnt been a factor in politics for a long time.

SOP reply for Fail&Can'tGo. 'Shut the fuck up' on a public message board. Goes to demonstrate the intellectual level of the lefty borgs very nicely. Thanks Fail.

I think Palin would be a good president, FAR better than what we have now. The only reason I don't want her to run is this nation has such a strong prejudice against powerful women that she could not win. This nation believes for a woman to be strong and powerful they should be ugly. Look at our supreme court or the head of homeland security. The nation has this belief that if a woman is nice looking she should be home either helping her husband and raising a family or be a single mother struggling to make ends meet. There seems to be no place for a nice looking, intelligent woman in politics today. The democrats will now try to tell us that pelosi is pretty. Well that's why they are democrats.

There has never been another person and her family that has been so ill treated in American politics as Mrs. Palin and her children. It's just flat out disgusting to me. And no matter how they try the lefties and the lefty ass kissers can't justify it.
 
 
Sara was a never was and will not ever be. She is a nice lady who discovered she could make more money making speeches than being governor. Her quitting Alaska for money is far worse to me than the mindless BS she puts out. Let her go back to fishing and looking at Russia from her front porch.
 
 
 
I really dont think people on the right were ever that obsessed with Palin.

 

Yeah.....

 "Palin Is Racist, Sexist, Vindictive, And Mean 

 
 
 
Palin was granted a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity by McCain to position herself for the 2012 Republican Presidential Convention. With few serious presidential contenders in the GOP, this should have been her big opportunity to take center stage for 2012 - and certainly 2016.

Potential presidential candidates for president are put on a steep learning curve and expected to learn from their past mistakes. Under the close scrutiny of the media and the opposition, you are only allowed so many "mistakes" before your fiancial donors bail out and you are unceremoniously relegated to the sidelines.

After serving as a state governor and spending almost 3 years in the national spotlight (including FOXNEWS), Palin has had every opportunity to demonstrate signs of personal or political "growth" as a candidate. Sarah Palin's recent remarks about Michelle Obama and "blood libel" are just 2 in a long series of "guffaws" that may endear her to The Tea Party, but finally appear to have pushed her far beyond the legal limit of "self-inflicted" mistakes.

Appearently Roger Ailes, president of Fox News Channel and chairman of the Fox Television Stations Group, is totally exasperated with Palin for seeking and receiving his advice on how/how not to respond to the "fallout" from the Arizona shootings - and then totally ignoring it. Ailes had also been the media consultant for Republican presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George H. W. Bush, as well as Rudy Giuliani, during his 1st campaign for mayor of New York.

After 3 years, Sarah Palin has demonstrated that she is not, and never will be, ready got prime-time - unless its "Saturday Night Live!"

So you don't have the brain cell either... so who the hell has it today? Not you, not Fail&Won'tGo.... ohhhhh.... are y'all saving it for a special occasion?

For the non brain cell lefties.... my objection is that he accuses me of being a Palin supporter. Fucking idiot.

Yeah, sure, you just described " conservatives' " description of the traditional -woman; powerful, strong, intelligent.

Ya' want traditional....like the good, ol' days ????

 

How 'bout morality?? Ya' want some good, traditional " conservative " -morality????

 
"And her parents let her attend school like that. And I think its incumbent upon us to create some areas where students can be safe in school and show up in proper attire so what happened in Texas doesnt happen to our students," she added."

 Morality; Just Like God Intended...

That comment is beneath anyone Willow. Your man had 8 yrs (2000-2008) to do whatever it is he wanted to do besides liberate the wealthy. I'm guessing you voted for him 2X?

So, Fail&Won'tGo doesn't have the brain cell today, Plamsabollocks doesn't have the brain cell today.... and Dotty Commie doesn't have the brain cell today.... who the fuck has the lefties brain cell?

Jeeez, 'you people' (and by 'you people', I mean those who are so stuck in their groupthink borg state that they assume that if one does not support Obama, that automatically means one did support Bush) are so fucking stupid, it's actually painful for other people.

Just be glad that stupidity isn't illegal.
 
 
I wonder why Fayzie is so hung up on Sarah Palin. We have two posts back to back designed to give the impression that Palin's popularity is fading in the GOP. What's the point of posting stuff about the former governor of Alaska while gas prices hover around $4.00, food prices spiked, there is record flooding in the midwest and northeast, three nuclear reactors are melting down upwind from Hawaii, crazy Moammar is murdering his own people and the president is playing golf and planning a spring break to Rio? I guess it indicates that hatred is sometimes stronger than common sense.

Let's review.

The OP claims "CG and Stephanie, the rest of the Palin loving Repugs wipe your arses."

1. You will not find a post from me supporting Palin.

2. I am not a Republican.

Which one of us is stupid?

It is not me. It is you and fail&won'tgo.... and any other fucking idiot who thinks anyone who doesn't support Obama must automatically be a Republican... and that supporting the principles of the TEA Parties automatically makes me a 'Palin lover'.

For the terminally stupid (again)....I am not a Republican. I have never been a Republican. I am unlikely ever to be a Republican. I am a conservative. I support the principles of the TEA Party. I do not support Sarah Palin. Just because none of you are capable of critical thought and logic to form your own opinions, do not assume that the rest of us are incapable. Your stupidity does not reflect badly on me.... but it confirms your status as assclown for anyone with an IQ over room temperature.
 
 
These stupid ass liberals still don't understand the GOP's strategy.

The GOP (including Palin) are USING PALIN.........read again, USING PALIN and other big name conservatives right now as a strategy. They are lightning rods to attract the zombie rage of the left wing. You moron lefties are gonna expend all your energy and hate trying to tear down a handful of right wing people, expose your ugly side, and basically direct all your rage towards them. The mainstream is gonna get tired of if, and it will manifest in a few ways. ONE is a lower rating for those lightning rods. EVERYONE, left and right and middle, gets tired of hearing the same names and same left wing rage. It gets dull. And right now, Palin, Gingrich, Bachman, etc, etc, are doing EXACTLY what they are meant to do, attract the rage and hate of the left.

Meanwhile, dark horse, unknown candidates are being groomed to come out for the GOP. The 2012 Republican nominee won't be Romney, or Palin, or Gingrich. You moron lefties are just taking the bait.

I almost feel bad telling you this strategy, but your zombie like hatred is so strong, you'll keep chasing Palin and Co until the day before the election.

THEN, when the GOP does bring up some fresh faces, the public will see the left wing zombie rage shift into attack mode towards them, and they'll all think "Why haven't they been talking bad about this guy before? They're just trying to tear him down." And you'll look like pathetic losers.

I told you all the strategy of the GOP in 2009, with a "leaderless" movement. You lefties preached "THE GOP HAS NO LEADERS" and you then attacked the simple idea of being right wing. Which backfired. Without a leader to attack, you all attacked the people, creating the Tea Party and right wing momentum. You made the average joe feel like you were attacking him directly. Brilliant GOP tactic which gave them the house in 2010 and countless state victories, which brought us the Wisconsin victory and other right wing wins. The "leaderless" strategy made you moron lefties direct your hate to the common folk, and it was a brilliant tactic.

Now, with the imminent need for a 2012 candidate, the GOP uses a lightning rod tactic. Draw out all the left wing's hate efforts to well known names, then sucker punch the Dems with a no-name candidate that comes out of nowhere (sound familiar?) in 2012.

You Dems just never learn.

That comment is beneath anyone Willow. Your man had 8 yrs (2000-2008) to do whatever it is he wanted to do besides liberate the wealthy. I'm guessing you voted for him 2X?  

 

It's not beneath you lefties. "MY MAN" as you so aptly put it was called every damn name in the book and then some. And no, you'd guess wrong. I actually voted for Al Gore the first time. Gawd, and I glad he wasn't President. He sucks.
 
 
 
 
...... She's still a good looking woman though.

 

Which has exactly WHAT to do with her qualifications to be a political candidate? Beautiful or ugly have nothing to do with it.

 

Actually there are historians who say that JFK was elected on his looks. There was a bump in voting from the female gender.

You can't believe that article written about Ailes. They used a unnamed source. That's what they have been talking about since it came out. There is no source to the story and you all fell for it hook line and sinker. Just like when they came out with a editorial within 2 hours after Giffords being shot blaming it all on Palin. TWO HOURS with no idea who the shooter was, motive or name of victims. The media went into overdrive with democrats and blamed Palin. You people don't use much common sense, reason with logic when it comes to her. Everybody acts on impulse when she does something. The media know's how to play everyone of you.

 The Palin Implosion - Yahoo! News 

 
NEW YORK – Sarah Palin has gone from the most divisive figure in politics to the most polarizing within the GOP. John Avlon on the polls that show her path to the nomination keeps getting steeper.

Call off the coronation—the media’s caught on to the slow motion implosion of Sarah Palin’s popularity, and with it her prospective presidential campaign.
A new Washington Post/ABC News poll found that Palin’s approval ratings among Republicans had declined by double digits since October, while her “strongly unfavorable” rating reached 17 percent among the GOP and 28 percent among Republican-leaning independents. This shift in the conservative populist tide provoked a series of memorable (and frankly enviable) headlines like “The Incredible Shrinking Sarah Palin” from Politico and other outlets.

But the real story is the continued erosion of support for Sarah Palin. By the end of her three-month stint as John McCain’s VP nominee, 59 percent of American voters believed that Sarah Palin was not ready for the job, and 47 percent of self-described centrists said they were actually less likely to vote for McCain because of Palin’s presence on the ticket.

There was no doubt that she was beloved by the conservative base, but one year after the election, with Palin acting as voice of the opposition, 63 percent of Americans already said that they would “not seriously consider” her for president.

By April 2010, even 47 percent of Tea Party supporters said that Sarah Palin would not “have the ability to be an effective president”—while only 40 percent believed she would. At the height of Tea Party enthusiasm, Palin’s conservative populist base was saying “thanks, but no thanks” to a prospective presidential campaign. It was a judgment call by the people who knew her best..

 

Gift wrapped present for CG and Stephanie, the rest of the Palin loving Repugs wipe your arses.

 

The world around us is falling and the do nothing president is given a pass, yet you are worried to death about Sarah Palin.  
 
 
It's irrelevent. Palin never intended to run. The only good news is that, once people realize she's not a viable candidate, she will go away and leave the rest of us the fuck alone.

Wish away. You can't get around the fact that he is the duly elected leader of this country. That means enough of your countrymen pulled the lever for him to make your sour grapes irrelevant.

At this point, Palin is a sideshow.

She knows it too. That's why she's bringing in as much cash as possible before the circus closes.

To things like that, NOPE.

 
Describing her as a Liberal pretty-much exposes you as one o' those folks who was sucked- in, by her....and, now, you're tap-dancin' around it....trying to make things seem otherwise.

How weak.

 

LOL. Palin was the final straw that ensured I couldn't vote for McShame in 2008. There is no way on this planet that I could ever approve of a female politician, nevermind vote for one.
 
 
 
Palin is a never-was who is also a never-will-be. Her sole claim to fame is that she was selected to be the VP Candidate for one of the worst POTUS nominees in the history of the Republican Party and proceeded to help her running mate drive their campaign into the ground. She's a Liberal and a Hypocrite. That the Republican Party would even consider her as a potential candidate is a farce. That any Conservative would even consider supporting her in any way is even more laughable.

 

Sarah Palins a Liberal?
She helped to drive McCains campaign into the ground?
Are there any Conservatives in the New England area?
 
 
 
She's a Liberal? Boy, I can understand you're wanting to get rid of her but, really?

 

Conservatives WALK the TALK. That's why I'll tell you there aren't ANY Conservatives in Washington, DC and haven't been since the Presidency of Andrew Jackson. Sarah Palin has been unable to Walk the Talk. That makes her a Liberal by definition; just like every other member of the Republican Party.

Whats wrong wih a female as a political candidate? Surely you aren't suggesting that a man could do better? Hell men have been running this country for years and look where we are now.

It has been my opinion for my entire life that women do not belong in politics in any way. Not as candidates. Not as campaign workers. Not as voters. It is not the appropriate and proper role of women in society so far as I'm concerned and never will be.

Yes, cause the fuctard men have done so well. Right? You are a moron.

Sarah Palin is not a liberal
McCain's campaign was down long before Sarah came along she gave it a boost.
What exactly is a conservative to you?
Would any New England Republican be one in your viiew?
 
 
 
Yes, cause the fuctard men have done so well. Right? You are a moron.

 

I'm not saying that the Men have done any better. However, there is the POTENTIAL for a decent Male politician while there is not such a potential with female candidates.
 
 
Who?

Sarah Palin is not a liberal

 

On that we will have to disagree.

From women and metrosexuals. Not the people I'd want voting for me.

 
What exactly is a conservative to you?

 

A traditionalist. Someone who believes in traditional morals, values, and ideals above all else. Someone who does not compromise and who actually lives their life by the same ideals they pronounce.

 
Would any New England Republican be one in your viiew?

 

No. Not a one. There is no such thing as a two party system here in New England. New Hampshire is about the lone holdout of any decency whatsoever.

Men haven't the right to dictate to women they have a shared investment in this country I think they should bare some of the respondsibility in leadersip of this country.

Let's agree to disagree on the first three and the last one I really feel sorry for you, your field is limited.
 
 
 
This is why people view Conservatives the way they do.^^^^^^^ wake up barefoot and pragnet days are over with.

 

Then humanity no longer has any value and we've become nothing more than another worthless virus on this planet. The United States WAS the last hope for any form of values and decency in humanity and apparently we've thrown that away. The ability to choose Right over Wrong is what supposedly made human beings BETTER than the other animals. Without that we're nothing more than any other animal, fit to be hunted to extinction for the betterment of the planet as a whole.

I disagree about as completely as humanly possible.

That's fine. Agreeing to disagree is more than acceptable to me. On the last item.... With any luck I'll be leaving New England before the next election cycle, so it's not that big a deal to me.

In the declaration of indepenence it starts out with "We the People" That means all people of all sexist and races.
 
 
There was a time, long long ago and far far away when Anachronism actually posted a couple of insightful things.

But he has certainly jumped the shark, as evidenced in this thread. Un-FRELLING-believable.

How many Founding Mothers signed that document, or were involved in the writing of the US Constitution?

Though I will agree with you on the race issue.

Oh you agree with me on race but not about women? Women aren't proprety they are people too.

If you folks had known me better you would have realized that the insightful comments were the anomaly for me, not these types of comments.

Correct. They aren't property. That doesn't mean they're the same as Men or that they should be the same as Men. You can see the latrine this country has turned into over the last century, and the feminist movement has been Abigail part of that.

There isn't much more I will say on this subject, but this simple statement.

Man was created first, then the women. God took the rib from man because he created them equal partners. He did not take a bone from the foot, so they are not stepping stones, He did not take a bone from the back because they were never meant to follow nor did he take a bone from the hand because they were never meant to be hit. From the rib they ame to be equal with man.
 
 
 
 
 
I'd vote for Palin before I'd vote for the present piece of shit. Thanks for listening.

 

That comment is beneath anyone Willow. You're man had 8 yrs (2000-2008) to do whatever it is he wanted to do besides liberate the wealthy. I'm guessing you voted for him 2X?  

 

So, Fail&Won'tGo doesn't have the brain cell today, Plamsabollocks doesn't have the brain cell today.... and Dotty Commie doesn't have the brain cell today.... who the fuck has the lefties brain cell?

Jeeez, 'you people' (and by 'you people', I mean those who are so stuck in their groupthink borg state that they assume that if one does not support Obama, that automatically means one did support Bush) are so fucking stupid, it's actually painful for other people.

Just be glad that stupidity isn't illegal.

 

What the Hell is this "brain cell" you keep referring-to??!!!

 

I'm pretty certain it's obvious, to most, you're lacking any-and-all capabilities/intelligence to (even) be considered a chemical-biologist or neurobiologist....that you're nothing-more than a common, ordinary, garden-variety Bubblehead / Bimbo....so, I'm wondering....from what academic-discipline have you gleaned the term "brain cell"....as if it was some kind of individual-entity/organ ????  
 
 
 
These stupid ass liberals still don't understand the GOP's strategy.

The GOP (including Palin) are USING PALIN.........read again, USING PALIN and other big name conservatives right now as a strategy. They are lightning rods to attract the zombie rage of the left wing. You moron lefties are gonna expend all your energy and hate trying to tear down a handful of right wing people, expose your ugly side, and basically direct all your rage towards them. The mainstream is gonna get tired of if, and it will manifest in a few ways. ONE is a lower rating for those lightning rods. EVERYONE, left and right and middle, gets tired of hearing the same names and same left wing rage. It gets dull. And right now, Palin, Gingrich, Bachman, etc, etc, are doing EXACTLY what they are meant to do, attract the rage and hate of the left.

 

 

 

Nice try.

That's Christianity's take on things. However, I'm not a Christian, so I'm not sure why that would have any impact on me.

Did I say I was? I just believe in creation. It takes more faith to believe in the big bang theroy and here we are, than it does to believe something bigger than any of us is out there.

You're touting their party line, so I had to believe that you were supporting it. I'm not a Big-Banger. I believe in Creation, just not Christianity's version of it.
