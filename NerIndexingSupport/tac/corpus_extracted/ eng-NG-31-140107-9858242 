Well after much debating i have decided to take the plunge and go to
Madrid. Our neighbour died on Monday at the age of 51 and hey what the
heck, life's too short!!!
So anyway, any tips for a good hotel, and a good area to stay. I'm
taking my wife and daughter and going to make a holiday of it.
Also, for those going, and who have an iPod, you can download a free
city guide to madrid at http://www.podcityguides.com/
