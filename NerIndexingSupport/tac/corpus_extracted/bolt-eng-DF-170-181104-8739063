Obama has already rebounded in the polls so the race baiting aint working for you guys.
 
 
The only thing McCain has to do to win is show Jeremiah Wright preaching for 5 seconds.

Obama is running for President. Jeremiah Wright is not running and the voters realize this. The Republicans have ridden this Wright horse into the ground. There is nothing more that can be done with this strategy  and the more that the Republican try, the more the voters will be turned off by the apparent desperation.

The over-the-top rhetoric was brought to Obamas attention. Obama denounced it. Enough said. I sort of hope that the Republicans keep bringing it up. The more they do so, the more the voters will vote for him out of spite.

Please. This is America, dude. By November, most people won't have the faintest idea who the hell Jeremiah Wright is.

True  unless the Republicans keep reminding them.
 
 
And we keep reminding American John "W" McSame sought the Hagee endorsement.

Expect the Dems to keep showing that clip of McCain saying we'll be in Iraq for 100 years.

That's probably as good a strategy as any.
 
 
 
And we keep reminding American John "W" McSame sought the Hagee endorsement.

 

Care to expand on that thought? McCain NEVER sought out Hagee and asked for his endorsement. That is why we tend to call such things an unsolicited endorsement.

McCain NEVER attended Hagee's congregation.
McCain NEVER called Hagee a "friend" or "mentor."
McCain has NEVER referred to Hagee as being "like part of his family."
McCain has NEVER had Hagee participate with ANY of his campaigns in ANY capacity.

So please, post your reason for trying to equate Hagee's unsolicited endorsement of McCain to Wright's endorsement of Obama. It won't fly, and by now you should be aware of which logical fallacies you're guilty of when trying to make that connection.
 
 
 
True  unless the Republicans keep reminding them.

 

You might want to consider that the Clinton camp will be running, and re-running this and other clips (notably one by Sen. James Meeks (D-IL)) in an effort to derail the Obama nomination altogether.

If somehow, Obama hangs on to the Democrat nomination, THEN you'll probably see the Republicans pulling out all the stops. But, before that time you should expect the Clintons to be doing the heavy lifting against Obama.

you mean that he wouldn't mind us being in Iraq for 100 years....but you all seem to forget the second part with no casualities

It's funny how you all say a racist is taken out of context...

It's worked so far...
 
 
 
is call the R candidate John "W" McSame.

 

I realize you like to think you're being original, TM, but couldn't you have just piggybacked this onto one of the countless Obama threads already in existence?

It's just the same old stuff.

But Gunny, Obama is their "knight" in shinning armor, they need to spread the word, no matter the repetition.  
 
 
No hes my candidate of choice.

He will at least not continue the destruction or our country presided over by Bush.

McSame has already said he would.

No, he'll just destroy the country with a race war and Jeremiah Wright leading the way with the New Black Panther party.

Ok wise guy explain how if Obama will withdraw all the combat brigades with in 16 months AND have no permanent bases in Iraq how he will ALSO have combat brigades in Iraq to crush any AL Queda that resurface? He has stated that IS his plan.

Because he has already said he will listen to the commanders on the ground and do what is best to achieve a safe exit.

McSame on the other hand will have us there his entire tenure in office.

Look at what he said. You can not both have no combat brigades and no permanent bases in Iraq AND have combat Brigades IN Iraq at the same time. They are mutually exclusive. Further the dieing won't stop IF he is going to pull out but go back every time there is a problem, in fact I suggest the dieing will increase for us since rather then on the ground in place we will have to move to the hot spots allowing attacks every step of the way. We won't have a working knowledge of the people or the forces already there either.

Or this one...
 http://rasmussenreports.com/public_c..._tracking_poll 

Nationally, Hillary Clinton now holds a very slight advantage over Barack Obama, 46% to 44%. Before the story broke about his former Pastor, Obama led Clinton by eight percentage points (see recent daily results). While the national polls remain close, Rasmussen Markets data gives Obama a -% chance to win the Democratic nomination while expectations for a Clinton victory are at -%.
 
 
 
Wow I hope this is a joke.

 

What? You never heard of Mugabe?
 
 
We were talking about President Obama.
 
 
 
Wow I hope this is a joke.

 

It is silly speculation, imagination and paranoia.

Whether McCain was taken out of context or not - or even if he is correct - the American public does not want hear the troops being in Iraq for 100 years, especially when there is no end in sight to the conflict and Americans continue dying.

Doesn't matter.

Clinton must pull off a string of upsets in states like NC and Indiana to win, which seems unlikely.

Hey, touche. I mean, this campaign will be a heck of a lot of fun for the negative ad-makers on both sides.

No she doesn't just come closer than she is now and continue to create doubt that Obama can win the general election. The superdelegates will hand her the nomination, remember, her and Bill have been at this alot longer than Obama.

That would be inconvenient to include, it would destroy the spin they want on it. That it COMPLETELY invalidates the complaint is beside the point.

It would be the same as complaining that we still have troops in Europe now for 63 years and no end in sight. Or Korea for 58 years. Or Japan for 63 years as well.

Oh. Obama rejects Black Panther Party endorsement.

When we were alerted of the existence of this page, we pulled it down. Yet even after we pulled the page, Fox News continues to disingenuously and prominently feature this “story” on their homepage.

After I tried to cut through the spin and get to the cold, hard, facts and learned of the details, I considered it to be no big deal.
