A Wisconsin man was held on Wednesday for holding police at bay for 15 hours after shooting out his television in a rage over Bristol Palin's performance on TV's "Dancing with the Stars."

The standoff in the central Wisconsin town of Vermont ended peacefully Tuesday with the arrest of Steven Cowan, 67, on charges of reckless endangerment.

According to a criminal complaint, Cowan shouted an expletive, took out a shotgun and shot into his television during an airing of the popular reality show.

The object of his ire was Bristol Palin, a contestant on the popular ABC show and the daughter of former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin.

Cowan didn't consider her a good dancer, Cowan's wife, Janice, told authorities, according to the complaint.

Fearing that she might be the next target, Janice Cowan went to the local police department and the standoff ensued.

Other viewers of the show voted to promote Palin into the next round.

Bristol Palin was propositioned by "Dancing with the Stars" rival Mike "The Situation" Sorrentino of "Jersey Shore" fame backstage, who went so far as to whip out some condoms.

But it wasn't for real -- it was a public service announcement to promote safe sex.

In the commercial, Palin -- whose mother Sarah was the last Republican vice presidential candidate and is a leader of the conservative Tea Party movement -- rebuffs The Situation's advances, saying, "I avoid situations."

The spotlight fell on Bristol Palin during the 2008 presidential campaign when her teen-age pregnancy became known. The single mother now advocates sexual abstinence.

Palin and The Situation made the ad for the Candie's Foundation, whose goal is to reduce teen pregnancy. Palin became an ambassador for the organization last year.

In the ad, The Situation, who gained fame in MTV's reality show "Jersey Shore," bumps into Palin backstage and starts hitting on her.

Sarah Palin's 16-year-old daughter Willow Palin used multiple homophobic slurs -- including the word f**got -- to attack a Facebook user who criticized her mom's new reality show.... TMZ has learned.

During the premiere of "Sarah Palin's Alaska" Sunday night -- a boy named Tre who went to school with the Palin kids wrote a status update that read, "Sarah Palin's Alaska, is failing so hard right now."

The comment sparked an intense response from Willow -- who replied on the boy's wall, "Haha your so gay. I have no idea who you are, But what I've seen pictures of, your disgusting... My sister had a kid and is still hot."

Willow followed up that comment with another that read, "Tre stfu. Your such a f**got."

Bristol Palin also got in on the smacktalk -- writing a message to Tre saying, "You're running your mouth just to talk sh*t."

Eventually, a message board war erupted -- and Bristol took aim at another person named Jon -- saying, "You'll be as successful as my baby daddy, And actually I do work my ass off. I've been a single mom for the last two years."

After more users began to gang up on the Palins, Willow dropped another message that read, "Sorry that you guys are all jealous of my families success and you guys aren't goin to go anywhere with your lives."

Sources connected to the Palin family tell us... Willow normally doesn't use this type of language, but she felt like she was being attacked along with her family. The source added it was the baby bear defending Mama Grizzly.

Sarah's fans are voting and keeping Bristol on Dancing With the Stars.
Most people agree she can't dance. I've only seen clips and she can't.
 
 
I do not get the appeal of DWTS. Bad dancing, bad music, bad interviews. I could care less whether Bristol Palin is on it or not. I think I saw about 15 minutes of this crap during its first season.

I do think it is odd Bristol Palin is doing up a safe sex ad with the current poster boy for Everything That Is Wrong With Young Men Today from "The Jersey Shore". If that was my daughter, I wouldn't even want her in the same room with Mr. Sleaze. And if I had a public image, I would not want my child associated with what may be the worst television show ever made.

What next? PSAs on drunk driving with Snookie? Tips on single motherhood with one of the Kardashian sluts?
 
 
 
Apparently Palin is not teaching this 16 year old proper English anymore than she is teaching her morals. Why can't this kid use an apostrophe? You are = you're, not your.

 

Come on, Mad...you have plenty of ammunition to attack Palin without having to resort to bringing her kids into the mix. Besides, it's a stretch to judge any parents based on how their children talk smack with their peers. The guy got under her skin and she felt inclined to defend her family in a childish manner...BFD.

I do not run a media outlet, Sherry. I did not report this story. But for the record, I also don't excuse the Palins for the homophobic slurs their 16 year old feels comfy using on the 'net....and a bit of supervision would have prevented this brohauhau.

I find them irrelevant because she is NOT running for election.

I ridicule those who want to make relevant discussions out of the irrelevant, not for the first time, or the second, or the third, or the forth, or maybe the fifth.....but since November 2008, there appears to have been at least 50 threads about Palin, Palin's family, Possible Palin Plans, Etc., Etc., Etc., using as weak as an excuse as an article in TMZ to hurl vapid insults like "this bitch."

Even Tina Fey's Palin references are getting old.

I scarcely know where to begin.........

Your thoughts?

 

My thoughts? OK. You need to accept the fact that you just are not as hot nor as personable as Sarah Palin and find something of significance over which to have your meltdowns.

Or, if that's not possible, get a Golds membership, use it, and find a good plastic surgeon.

Your obsessive hate is pathological at this point. As I said before, your obsessive and visceral hate-spewing about her and her family is like your taking poison and hoping they die.

My wife watches "Dancing With the Stars" religiously. She knows everything and everyone on that show.

She thinks that Sarah Palin's daughter is being allowed to work her way up to the finals for political reasons. She thinks that Sarah Palin's daughter is a terrible dancer - much worse than a number of others who have already been kicked off.

She thinks there is a hidden agenda here, designed to keep Sarah Palin herself in the national spotlight as much as possible. Could it be that the producers of this show are right wingers?

Anyone else think like my wife?
 
 
I doubt there is an agenda... it would be shocking if a tv channel participated in such trickery  

But seriously, what makes her a star?

Nothing.... she is the daughter of a politician, and nothing more.

This is why I would rather watch grass grow than watch ANY of these type of shows.
 
 
I don't watch the show, but I thought that the viewers from home voted on who went on and who gets kicked off.

If thats so, how in the hell could she be "allowed" to continue? She got more votes, nationwide, than the person who got kicked off.

The whole fauxrage just comes across as complete whinery to me.

Already forgotten that crappy karaoke singer, who kept getting votes to stay on American Idol a few years ago?

This all a goofy popularity contest.

So what if they are?

That's no different than Howard Stern listeners "stacking the deck" on American Idol.

The difference here is that it's making heads on the nutbar left explode, so it's much more amusing this time around.
 
 
Who fucking cares?

If the people who didn't want Bristol to continue disliked her that much, they could stack the vote the other way.

Any way you cut it, it's a level playing field. It's all a bunch of whinery.

Fuck, I can't even stand the Palin clan, but getting panties in a bunch over a stupid reality show is a waste of time.

Wrong. Since it is a contest with a prize, ignoring the results would be in violation of many laws.

That's just sick. Really.
 
 
 
 
 
Sixteen is far too old to excuse using homophobic slurs, Sherry, especially in public. If this was my kid I'd be keeping her at home for a semester -- but then Palin has much better things to do than watch her kids, eh?

 

For typing faggot in the heat of the moment?? That is a complete overreaction in my opinion. I do believe your hatred for Sarah Palin is overshadowing your better judgment in this situation.

 

You're hoping for a lot from Maddie there...  

 

Honestly, I don't know what I would have done, Sherry. My kid has no bigotry in her, never has, and it just never came up.

I did once ground her for a semester, though. I was not a permissive parent.

Which there is no law against. Vote for the Worst has been ruining American Idol for four years now. It's a goddamn popularity contest. Let's all focus on more important things.

 

There is also no law against the producers ignoring the votes and advancing whoever they please.

 

Wrong. Since it is a contest with a prize, ignoring the results would be in violation of many laws.

 

Name one.

My thoughts? OK. You need to accept the fact that you just are not as hot nor as personable as Sarah Palin and find something of significance over which to have your meltdowns.

Or, if that's not possible, get a Golds membership, use it, and find a good plastic surgeon.

Your obsessive hate is pathological at this point. As I said before, your obsessive and visceral hate-spewing about her and her family is like your taking poison and hoping they die.

 

Its OK for her to hate, its for the greater good, Object to an ideology that calls for your death and prove it with scripture.
You're a Nazi monster!

Good to know that your kid managed not to pick up the bigotry of its mother.

*Since Maddie bought her kid into the thread, I see no reason why others shouldn't respond to it.

I wouldn't assume that a 16-year old trying to lash back at someone in the heat of the moment is necessarily a bigot. Everyone and everything was "so gay" when I was in HS. It's insensitive, but does not prove bigotry. Also, our children behave differently around us than they do their peers. My mother thought I was quite the angel.    
 
 
 
 
A Wisconsin man was held on Wednesday for holding police at bay for 15 hours after shooting out his television in a rage over Bristol Palin's performance on TV's "Dancing with the Stars."

The standoff in the central Wisconsin town of Vermont ended peacefully Tuesday with the arrest of Steven Cowan, 67, on charges of reckless endangerment.

According to a criminal complaint, Cowan shouted an expletive, took out a shotgun and shot into his television during an airing of the popular reality show.

The object of his ire was Bristol Palin, a contestant on the popular ABC show and the daughter of former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin.

Cowan didn't consider her a good dancer, Cowan's wife, Janice, told authorities, according to the complaint.

Fearing that she might be the next target, Janice Cowan went to the local police department and the standoff ensued.

Other viewers of the show voted to promote Palin into the next round.

Bristol Palin was propositioned by "Dancing with the Stars" rival Mike "The Situation" Sorrentino of "Jersey Shore" fame backstage, who went so far as to whip out some condoms.

But it wasn't for real -- it was a public service announcement to promote safe sex.

In the commercial, Palin -- whose mother Sarah was the last Republican vice presidential candidate and is a leader of the conservative Tea Party movement -- rebuffs The Situation's advances, saying, "I avoid situations."

The spotlight fell on Bristol Palin during the 2008 presidential campaign when her teen-age pregnancy became known. The single mother now advocates sexual abstinence.

Palin and The Situation made the ad for the Candie's Foundation, whose goal is to reduce teen pregnancy. Palin became an ambassador for the organization last year.

In the ad, The Situation, who gained fame in MTV's reality show "Jersey Shore," bumps into Palin backstage and starts hitting on her.

Sarah Palin's 16-year-old daughter Willow Palin used multiple homophobic slurs -- including the word f**got -- to attack a Facebook user who criticized her mom's new reality show.... TMZ has learned.

During the premiere of "Sarah Palin's Alaska" Sunday night -- a boy named Tre who went to school with the Palin kids wrote a status update that read, "Sarah Palin's Alaska, is failing so hard right now."

The comment sparked an intense response from Willow -- who replied on the boy's wall, "Haha your so gay. I have no idea who you are, But what I've seen pictures of, your disgusting... My sister had a kid and is still hot."

Willow followed up that comment with another that read, "Tre stfu. Your such a f**got."

Bristol Palin also got in on the smacktalk -- writing a message to Tre saying, "You're running your mouth just to talk sh*t."

Eventually, a message board war erupted -- and Bristol took aim at another person named Jon -- saying, "You'll be as successful as my baby daddy, And actually I do work my ass off. I've been a single mom for the last two years."

After more users began to gang up on the Palins, Willow dropped another message that read, "Sorry that you guys are all jealous of my families success and you guys aren't goin to go anywhere with your lives."

Sources connected to the Palin family tell us... Willow normally doesn't use this type of language, but she felt like she was being attacked along with her family. The source added it was the baby bear defending Mama Grizzly.

You obsession with the Palins borders on the clinical.

It's a by-product of the quiz show scandals of the 1950's. It definitely is illegal.

Quiz Show Scandals:

 
The entire matter was called "a terrible thing to do to the American people" by President Dwight D. Eisenhower.[3] After concluding the Harris Commission investigation, Congress passed a law prohibiting the fixing of quiz shows (and any other form of contest). [4] However, at the time, while the actions may have been disreputable, they were not illegal. As a result, no one went to prison for rigging game shows. The individuals who were prosecuted were charged because of attempts to cover up their actions, either by obstruction of justice or perjury.

My wife watches "Dancing With the Stars" religiously. She knows everything and everyone on that show.

She thinks that Sarah Palin's daughter is being allowed to work her way up to the finals for political reasons. She thinks that Sarah Palin's daughter is a terrible dancer - much worse than a number of others who have already been kicked off.

She thinks there is a hidden agenda here, designed to keep Sarah Palin herself in the national spotlight as much as possible. Could it be that the producers of this show are right wingers?

Anyone else think like my wife?

 

Lots of people. Probably the same people who believe crop circles are alien landing sites.

 

My wife believes that also.
 
 
My kids would be in serious trouble if they were on facebook calling people faggots and claiming that people are jealous because mom is successful.

Serious trouble.
 
 
 
 
 
Apparently Palin is not teaching this 16 year old proper English anymore than she is teaching her morals. Why can't this kid use an apostrophe? You are = you're, not your.

 

bristol is 20......unless you are referring to something 4 years ago????? In which I case I would say, rehab for palinism maddy, this is nuts.

 

The 16 year old is Willow, Trajan, not Bristol. This facebook meltdown just happened Sunday.

 

So?? You have hysterical foul mouthed meltdowns all the time. Why should you care? Hypocrite. LOL

Because there is a difference between calling you a useless blood-sucking tick on the ass of USMB and calling you a butch dyke, Shadow. One is accurate but nasty; the other is likely not accurate and not relevant and just plain bigotted.

I hope this little lesson in human dynamics has been helpful to you. Have a lovely Thanksgiving, you twit.

So a teenager called someone a faggot on the internet? Why is this an issue?

It's only bad to call someone a faggot if they really are a faggot.

Fuck that. She's raising a bigot and I find that abhorent.

Hate whom, Newby? I am not even angry at Shadow; I bet she really needed to ask me that question. I like you, despite all our differences.

I like Meghan McCain -- who is an adult, not a child. I dun think Chelsea -- who is also an adult -- got a fair shot at life and I hope she'll be happy in her marriage...and out from under the thumbs of those two sociopaths.

But let's not be disingenuous here, Trajan. Palin wraps Motherhood around herself like the American flag and for the exact same reasons. If she had no kids, she'd have bought some for the sake of her despicable climb to the top.

Like your phrase- "despicable climb to the top"...what was so despicable, or the better question is what is different form HER "climb" than say obamas or McCain or bush Clinton et al?

And at the end of the day, maddy, she never made it to the top....she an ex 2 year governor....I agree with Si Modo...you are consumed, you don't even know WHY you hate her because what you have said so far, well me? I just don't see it..

It's unfair to make a judgment on a teenager being a bigot, and by extension the parent's parenting skills, if--in the middle of an internet spat--the teen calls someone who's ripping on her family a faggot.

I've seen you throw around the cunt slur against some female posters on here, so by your own measure that must mean you're a woman-hating bigot.

If I remember right, you started another thread awhile back about her kids, in the FZ I think, and you also took the time to make that video about "Palin steak". What you're doing with threads like these is the USMB equivalent of those 501 (C) attack ads that are nothing more than slimy ad homs that hit outside of politics.

Bashing a politician's or public figure's family or personal life, even if their life and family is visible, is the dregs of discourse... if it can even be called that. It's like the rules here; you can go after family if that person brings it up... but even though it's allowed I still think it's tacky and smarmy to go after family anyways. It shows a lack of ammo from the attacker, that they have to stoop to that level.

If her highly-visible and publicized political views are a threat to this country, go after her politics. But hitting outside of her politics and going after her as a mom says more about what type of person you are than what type of parent she is.

Self-awareness is for winners, and you're looking the bitter fool with this Palin obsession. For real. You're the mirror version of USArmyFail when it comes to Palin. Think about it.

No way Americans think her no talent daughter can dance
 
 
No talent? Why? Because she can't dance or because her last name is Palin? Jeeez, get the fuck over yourself - bitching about some young girl cuz you dislike her Mom is seriously shallow.

Maybe conservatives are voting for her - just because it appears to drive the whiner nuts. I'm doing that... and I haven't even seen her dance. I've voted for her - just to piss people like you (and Madeline) off. It worked! Cool!
 
 
Norton, you are a mental case.

It's a popularity contest, not a dance competition.

She can dance.

Also she is the only person who has a no performance background in the show. She has made phenomenal progress.

She has earned her position.

Speaking of barely being able to converse without insulting anyone.........what exactly do you contribute to this board other than snarky comments about people and things you thing are "beneath" you? That's right.........not a fucking thing.

Go fuck yourself you sperm burping slimy rep whore, you have nothing of value or interest for anyone other than small minded assholes such as yourself.

Fuck off ya goddamn pedant, go please purists.
 
 
MERGED!!!

Suh-WEET!
 
 
 
 
 
The 16 year old is Willow, Trajan, not Bristol. This facebook meltdown just happened Sunday.

 

So?? You have hysterical foul mouthed meltdowns all the time. Why should you care? Hypocrite. LOL

 

Because there is a difference between calling you a useless blood-sucking tick on the ass of USMB and calling you a butch dyke, Shadow. One is accurate but nasty; the other is likely not accurate and not relevant and just plain bigotted.

I hope this little lesson in human dynamics has been helpful to you. Have a lovely Thanksgiving, you twit.

 

Keep telling yourself that anyway,if it helps you sleep at night...    
 
 
 
 
Oh!

My!

God!

This is an outrage! Who the fuck does she think she is?

 

I think it's a Caddy anyway. Looks like it. And the tail-light pattern when she steps on the brakes looks like those LED caddy taillights.

 

Whatever it is, it's outrageous! Puppies will die, or maybe little furry purry kitties.

Why do you hate so much, Maddie??  

 

Hate whom, Newby? I am not even angry at Shadow; I bet she really needed to ask me that question. I like you, despite all our differences.

I hate the rising tide of bigotry and fake religiosity in US politics, but that's an idea, not a person.

 

Sure I did. You think you must lecture everyone else on internet manners...of which you have none.

I see what you did here....    
 
 
 
 
 
The 16 year old is Willow, Trajan, not Bristol. This facebook meltdown just happened Sunday.

 

Willow...right.....I am having a hard time figuring out whats more ridiculous, that you know how old her kids are and what they are up to (I had to look up bristols age) etc. or you are off on this as if it means anything......whats the point maddy?  

 

The point is, Palin wants to be POTUS, Trajan. She whores out these kids of hers all over the media and then when one acts the fool we all have to pretend she's still Mother Of The Year?

Fuck that. She's raising a bigot and I find that abhorent.

Mamma Grizzly is a fuck up as a parent... that is the point.

 

That is once again just your hysterical opinion based on rumors and inuendo. You have no idea what the Palin kids home life is like,or what their relationship is with their parents and other siblings. And anyway...who made you the "judge" of who can and cannot be "mother of the year". How very moralistic and intolerant of you....self rightous hag that you are.  
 
 
Whatever...Palin's kids get a pass because they are kids, but kids that get knocked up out of wedlock are trash...there is so much bullshit on this thread.
 
 
Are parenting skills a prerequisite for the job of POTUS, or is this only if the person is female?

Theodore Roosevelt was one of the great Presidents. As a Parent, he was beyond lame.

James Buchanan didn't ever have Parenting problems, but he was a lousy president.

George Washington was a great father of the country, but he married a widow with two kids, and never had any of his own. However, the granddaughter of one of his step sons gained  notoriety as the wife of a famous traitor. 

We need to evaluate the candidate for office on competence and ideas.

From what I have seen, Palin did her work in a competent manner. And I like her basic ideas.
One can argue that her resignation as Governor was was either selfless surrender of a prize because of the expense Alaska was suffering because of PDS. Or her chickening out from the constant barrage of PDS. Or just selling out in order to flog a book. I would argue the first. You are, of course, entitled to your mistaken opinion if you disagree.

Getting bent out of shape because of a 16 year old girls face book screed is more than just a tad unhealthy.
 
 
Palin overload, for sure...STOP already...
 
 
 
Palin overload, for sure...STOP already...

 

they can't get enough.
 
 
Holy cow... Isn't it enough to dump on Sarah Palin? Why do you have to drag her kids into the "I hate Sarah" threads? You hate her so much you have to hate her kids too? That's pretty sad...
 
 
 
 
Palin overload, for sure...STOP already...

I have had my fill
 Can't get enough

Does this mean we should have "open season" on the Obama girls? They can't be all that perfect.

Hey, I love Sarah Palin and the job she does. She is spreading herself and clan, too thin, I fear, though. I haven't watched her Alaskan documentary ( reality show? ) OR DWTS, but have seen enough of the Palin lifestyle just surfing channels...   I could care less about their lifestyles, but am happy as heck that Sarah is doing a great job stimulating voters...
 
 
 
but am happy as heck that Sarah is doing a great job stimulating voters...

 

weeelll she could be doing a uhm ahhh better job of that too...there's a cable Chanel called Cinemax on cable and well....late at night they play    .....
 
 
 
Does this mean we should have "open season" on the Obama girls? They can't be all that perfect.

 

Geez.

        :eusa_ shhh:
 
 
First we had a liberal who can't take Bristol Palin made it to the finals, takes a shotgun and blows his TV set up and has a police standoff and now we have a White Powder substance sent in a envelope to Bristol at CBS studios. This was likely done by desperate liberals who has now resorted to terrorism to try to threaten Sarah Palin daughters life or possibly kill her. I think it is about time for the Palins to go ahead and get protection since most likely Sarah will run for President. This story is breaking as it happened tonight so stay tuned as more info comes in.

 Emergency at 'Dancing With the Stars' Over Powder Substance | TMZ.com 

 Inside Pulse | Dancing With The Stars Scandal: Bristol Palin’s Life Threatened By White Powder Substance 
 
 
There's so much hate for the Palins...it's sad really.
 
 
Good.
 
 
 
Good.

 

Are you wishing death upon Sarah Palins daughter and approve of this substance sent to her?
 
 
 
Whatever...Palin's kids get a pass because they are kids, but kids that get knocked up out of wedlock are trash...there is so much bullshit on this thread.

 

70% of black babies are born out of wedlock.

Racist.
 
 
The whole point of being a decent human being is you don't go there, no matter how bad a jerk off the other guy is. What makes a jerk off is jerk off behavior, not that you don't agree with him on economic questions.

So open season on 0bama girls is out of the question.

But for those who think it is ok to rap on the Palins, I wish you would crawl back under your rock.
 
 
 
 
 
glass houses, and all that.

Megan McCain is a know nothing dope grasping for viability, I wouldn't let her walk my dog....so what?

Chelsea married a hedge fund manager for god sakes at a multi million dollar wedding.... You don't hear me bashing her dad who RAN for pres. and the other who WAS pres..........so what?

Who has asked you to see her as mom of the year????  

PDS.....thats all I see here maddy, sorry.

 

I like Meghan McCain -- who is an adult, not a child. I dun think Chelsea -- who is also an adult -- got a fair shot at life and I hope she'll be happy in her marriage...and out from under the thumbs of those two sociopaths.

But let's not be disingenuous here, Trajan. Palin wraps Motherhood around herself like the American flag and for the exact same reasons. If she had no kids, she'd have bought some for the sake of her despicable climb to the top.

 

I think you are looking for reason to be 'offended' maddy. I think you really have a case of PDS.

Like your phrase- "despicable climb to the top"...what was so despicable, or the better question is what is different form HER "climb" than say obamas or McCain or bush Clinton et al?

And at the end of the day, maddy, she never made it to the top....she an ex 2 year governor....I agree with Si Modo...you are consumed, you don't even know WHY you hate her because what you have said so far, well me? I just don't see it..

 

About 10 days ago, CNN ran an outtake from a speech Palin gave to some midwest audience...Iowa, I think. She made enough biblical references to have it qualified as a homily, and the audience was in orgasm. The implication of her remarks was, the bible foretold her presidency and once installed in office, she will further the goals of every frustrated bully in the Religious Right.

Palin is Jimmy Swaggart on steroids, with the ambition of a Ghengus Khan. This woman will say or do anything to reach a position of power and God help us all if she succeeds. She is not a biblical prophecy come to life, but she is Sinclair Lewis':

"When fascism comes to America, it will come wrapped in a flag and waving a cross."

It saddens me that you don't see the threat she represents, Trajan -- but I have no doubt, eventually you will. This bitch is not subtle.

Bullshit. Palin cannot bang on her alleged superior mothering, whore her kids out to the media and then claim they should be "off limits" when something they do in public view disgraces her. I'm not gonna be silenced by this goofy hide-the-pea routine, Baruch.
 
 
 
 
 
No one denies these children actually exist, Tank.

Your point?
 
 
 
 
Good.

 

Are you wishing death upon Sarah Palins daughter and approve of this substance sent to her?

 

Yep, that's totally what I said.  
 
 
merged
 
 
Again? How the hell many threads on the bad conduct of Palin offspring are there?

Nice family
 
 
 
Whatever...Palin's kids get a pass because they are kids, but kids that get knocked up out of wedlock are trash...there is so much bullshit on this thread.

 

WTF??? So, if one is pregnant out of wedlock they are trash, eh?

Wow, just wow, ravi. That's some serious judgmental bullshit from you.
 
 
 
 
 
Willow...right.....I am having a hard time figuring out whats more ridiculous, that you know how old her kids are and what they are up to (I had to look up bristols age) etc. or you are off on this as if it means anything......whats the point maddy?  

 

The point is, Palin wants to be POTUS, Trajan. She whores out these kids of hers all over the media and then when one acts the fool we all have to pretend she's still Mother Of The Year?

Fuck that. She's raising a bigot and I find that abhorent.

Mamma Grizzly is a fuck up as a parent... that is the point.

 

It's unfair to make a judgment on a teenager being a bigot, and by extension the parent's parenting skills, if--in the middle of an internet spat--the teen calls someone who's ripping on her family a faggot.

I've seen you throw around the cunt slur against some female posters on here, so by your own measure that must mean you're a woman-hating bigot.

If I remember right, you started another thread awhile back about her kids, in the FZ I think, and you also took the time to make that video about "Palin steak". What you're doing with threads like these is the USMB equivalent of those 501 (C) attack ads that are nothing more than slimy ad homs that hit outside of politics.

Bashing a politician's or public figure's family or personal life, even if their life and family is visible, is the dregs of discourse... if it can even be called that. It's like the rules here; you can go after family if that person brings it up... but even though it's allowed I still think it's tacky and smarmy to go after family anyways. It shows a lack of ammo from the attacker, that they have to stoop to that level.

If her highly-visible and publicized political views are a threat to this country, go after her politics. But hitting outside of her politics and going after her as a mom says more about what type of person you are than what type of parent she is.

Self-awareness is for winners, and you're looking the bitter fool with this Palin obsession. For real. You're the mirror version of USArmyFail when it comes to Palin. Think about it.

 

I do appreciate the time and energy you dedicate to defending Palin, Sheldon. It's very appealing at first blush, this cry to "leave the kids alone", except that........

Palin has leveraged her oldest child's teen pregnancy into some sort of martyrdom and Bristol is now a public figure in her own right. The search phrase "bristol palin magazine interviews" returns about 6,080,000 results on Google. She's a reality tv star and has been on the covers of various magazines. The Palins cannot shove Bristol out into the limelight as a spokesmodel for safe sex (?) or any other high moral principle and then demand that all discussion of hypocrisy on her part will remain unspoken of.

Palin has also leveraged her youngest child as grounds for claiming she has a special claim to extraordinary consideration as a mother that the parents of normal, healthy children do not share. We did discuss this on a thread the Mod Squad has pulled, though I still dunno why. Once again, the hypocrisy thing: if you claim the moral high ground on some biographic basis and your private life reveals you do not adhere to the principles you claim to embody, that is discussion-worthy.

Palin makes so many references to her children and her motherhood, it's hard to keep track of them all. How many times has she said the phrase "Momma Grizzlies" alone? She cannot bang on her reproductive talents and then expect her parenting skills are beyond the pale by those who find fault with her, as a politican. And BTW, this is something Obama (nor any other politican I can think of) has ever done...."vote for me, I'm a great Mom" is unique to the Palin playbook, IMO.

Calling a woman a "cunt" is not a verbal act that reveals anyone's anti-woman bigotry IMO. You wanna imbue that word with more power than it deserves. Calling a youngster a "f*ggot", on the other hand, does reveal a homophobic bias. You may not like that these two are not the same egregious moral lapses, but that's life, Sheldon.

Relying on the USMB's own TOS for a logical reason why Palin's performance as a parent cannot be discussed is also a fail. Palin is not a USMB member -- she is a public figure. She wants to be POTUS and more'n a few people support her. She's a threat to this country and the very deceitful way she claims to be morally superior whilst deflecting any criticism of her moral lapses is one of the reasons I so despise her -- I find this woman to be canny but not smart, manipulative but not persuasive, jingoistic but not patriotic, etc.

Palin weaves her personal life and back story into her politics, Sheldon. She opposes abortion rights about as vehemently as it is possible to do -- more than most RCC clergy do -- and then waves her baby in the air. She opposes sex education in public schools and then shoves her single mom daughter into the limelight, and sees nothing at all hypocritical about allowing her to do up ads for condoms with a poster child for promiscuity. She attacks Obama as a "politican" and talks endlessly about how much she hates government -- how she'd rather be doing just about anything with her kids. Then she leaves the kids and runs around the country on a million dollar speaking tour, etc.

There's no way to have a full and frank discussion about Palin's suitability to serve as POTUS without drawing on examples of her hypocrisy, because that data is what I think most people are missing...and IMO, Palin is all about concealing her real motives and acts from public view whilst she dazzles the stupid with bullshit.
 
 
 
Are parenting skills a prerequisite for the job of POTUS, or is this only if the person is female?

Bingo.

So-called feminist sellouts to partisanship.

I suppose some have no grasp of what 'mock' means.

Yeah, I don't know, either. Same here, not going to put the waders on and go through it.

Good thread you started, though.   Most got it.

Funny, I learn more about Palin in this sort of crap than I ever had any desire to learn. (Same phenomenon with Limbaugh, too.)
 
 
 
The whole point of being a decent human being is you don't go there, no matter how bad a jerk off the other guy is. What makes a jerk off is jerk off behavior, not that you don't agree with him on economic questions.

So open season on 0bama girls is out of the question.

But for those who think it is ok to rap on the Palins, I wish you would crawl back under your rock.

 

I'm only saying that Sarah Palin and her family get absolutely vile insults, accusations, contemptuous slamming on a daily basis from Dems, feminists, leftists, etc. - if the same thing were done to the Obama girls there would be an ungodly uproar from the left.

I don't see that happening to the Obama girls. Should it happen? No. Maybe it all boils down to a lack of character in the antagonists.

If Sarah Palin had embraced the hard feminist doctrine and political views - she would have been adored. But she represents everything that feminists despise in a real woman.

If Sarah Palin had just done the right thing and aborted that useless little shit of a kid, she would have been applauded. But she's got the damned kid and that's a very sore point.

Bristol Palin is not the first teenager to get pregnant and have a child out of wedlock but she's a slut, a wanton whore, and has a negligent, despicable mother for allowing it to happen. Half the adored, fawned over women of Hollywood sleep with any man that comes down the pike and have children out of wedlock and it's celebrated.

There's a hell of a double standard when it comes to right and wrong.

Yeah, I don't know, either. Same here, not going to put the waders on and go through it.

Good thread you started, though.   Most got it.

Funny, I learn more about Palin in this sort of crap than I ever had any desire to learn. (Same phenomenon with Limbaugh, too.)

 

I'm tempted to start more Palin children threads, but I don't want to taunt the happy fun balls.
 
 
 
 
 
It's unfair to make a judgment on a teenager being a bigot, and by extension the parent's parenting skills, if--in the middle of an internet spat--the teen calls someone who's ripping on her family a faggot.

I've seen you throw around the cunt slur against some female posters on here, so by your own measure that must mean you're a woman-hating bigot.

If I remember right, you started another thread awhile back about her kids, in the FZ I think, and you also took the time to make that video about "Palin steak". What you're doing with threads like these is the USMB equivalent of those 501 (C) attack ads that are nothing more than slimy ad homs that hit outside of politics.

Bashing a politician's or public figure's family or personal life, even if their life and family is visible, is the dregs of discourse... if it can even be called that. It's like the rules here; you can go after family if that person brings it up... but even though it's allowed I still think it's tacky and smarmy to go after family anyways. It shows a lack of ammo from the attacker, that they have to stoop to that level.

If her highly-visible and publicized political views are a threat to this country, go after her politics. But hitting outside of her politics and going after her as a mom says more about what type of person you are than what type of parent she is.

Self-awareness is for winners, and you're looking the bitter fool with this Palin obsession. For real. You're the mirror version of USArmyFail when it comes to Palin. Think about it.

 

I do appreciate the time and energy you dedicate to defending Palin, Sheldon. It's very appealing at first blush, this cry to "leave the kids alone", except that........

Palin has leveraged her oldest child's teen pregnancy into some sort of martyrdom and Bristol is now a public figure in her own right. The search phrase "bristol palin magazine interviews" returns about 6,080,000 results on Google. She's a reality tv star and has been on the covers of various magazines. The Palins cannot shove Bristol out into the limelight as a spokesmodel for safe sex (?) or any other high moral principle and then demand that all discussion of hypocrisy on her part will remain unspoken of.

Palin has also leveraged her youngest child as grounds for claiming she has a special claim to extraordinary consideration as a mother that the parents of normal, healthy children do not share. We did discuss this on a thread the Mod Squad has pulled, though I still dunno why. Once again, the hypocrisy thing: if you claim the moral high ground on some biographic basis and your private life reveals you do not adhere to the principles you claim to embody, that is discussion-worthy.

Palin makes so many references to her children and her motherhood, it's hard to keep track of them all. How many times has she said the phrase "Momma Grizzlies" alone? She cannot bang on her reproductive talents and then expect her parenting skills are beyond the pale by those who find fault with her, as a politican. And BTW, this is something Obama (nor any other politican I can think of) has ever done...."vote for me, I'm a great Mom" is unique to the Palin playbook, IMO.

Calling a woman a "cunt" is not a verbal act that reveals anyone's anti-woman bigotry IMO. You wanna imbue that word with more power than it deserves. Calling a youngster a "f*ggot", on the other hand, does reveal a homophobic bias. You may not like that these two are not the same egregious moral lapses, but that's life, Sheldon.

Relying on the USMB's own TOS for a logical reason why Palin's performance as a parent cannot be discussed is also a fail. Palin is not a USMB member -- she is a public figure. She wants to be POTUS and more'n a few people support her. She's a threat to this country and the very deceitful way she claims to be morally superior whilst deflecting any criticism of her moral lapses is one of the reasons I so despise her -- I find this woman to be canny but not smart, manipulative but not persuasive, jingoistic but not patriotic, etc.

Palin weaves her personal life and back story into her politics, Sheldon. She opposes abortion rights about as vehemently as it is possible to do -- more than most RCC clergy do -- and then waves her baby in the air. She opposes sex education in public schools and then shoves her single mom daughter into the limelight, and sees nothing at all hypocritical about allowing her to do up ads for condoms with a poster child for promiscuity. She attacks Obama as a "politican" and talks endlessly about how much she hates government -- how she'd rather be doing just about anything with her kids. Then she leaves the kids and runs around the country on a million dollar speaking tour, etc.

There's no way to have a full and frank discussion about Palin's suitability to serve as POTUS without drawing on examples of her hypocrisy, because that data is what I think most people are missing...and IMO, Palin is all about concealing her real motives and acts from public view whilst she dazzles the stupid with bullshit.

 

Madeline. I can't stand Palin. But you are obsessed here. Sheldon was 100% correct, you are acting as USArmyRetired's doppelganger.

 

I'm sorry you see things this way, Radio. I like you and value your opinion -- but all you Palin apologists are 100% wrong IMO. Mark my words....her campaign for POTUS, successful or not, will rip this country in two because of the rhetoric she will use.

She's no country fair buffoon...she's Joe McCarthy is a skirt.

We could have a 'Palin Forum' with a sub forum for each family member. That would be nice.

A better way to arrange that would be to give USarmyret, Madeline, Sinatra, and whoever the other obsessive is each a subforum, perhaps.

Pretty funny shit, eh?

But, the strawman IS Madeline's forte (only it's not purposeful when she consistently does it); and grasping reality is not. Stunning.
 
 
 
 
The whole point of being a decent human being is you don't go there, no matter how bad a jerk off the other guy is. What makes a jerk off is jerk off behavior, not that you don't agree with him on economic questions.

So open season on 0bama girls is out of the question.

But for those who think it is ok to rap on the Palins, I wish you would crawl back under your rock.

 

I'm only saying that Sarah Palin and her family get absolutely vile insults, accusations, contemptuous slamming on a daily basis from Dems, feminists, leftists, etc. - if the same thing were done to the Obama girls there would be an ungodly uproar from the left.

I don't see that happening to the Obama girls. Should it happen? No. Maybe it all boils down to a lack of character in the antagonists.

If Sarah Palin had embraced the hard feminist doctrine and political views - she would have been adored. But she represents everything that feminists despise in a real woman.

If Sarah Palin had just done the right thing and aborted that useless little shit of a kid, she would have been applauded. But she's got the damned kid and that's a very sore point.

Bristol Palin is not the first teenager to get pregnant and have a child out of wedlock but she's a slut, a wanton whore, and has a negligent, despicable mother for allowing it to happen. Half the adored, fawned over women of Hollywood sleep with any man that comes down the pike and have children out of wedlock and it's celebrated.

There's a hell of a double standard when it comes to right and wrong.

 

No one I know of has judged Bristol for getting pregnant. I have and do judge Sarah Palin an unfit mother on various bases, none of which would be worth mentioning if she did not run around declaring herself to be Mother of The Year as she "uncampaigns" for POTUS, Granny.

I have never said nor read any comment to the effect that she had no right to have that baby. What I did say was getting pregnant for the fifth time in your forties is irresponsible and that abandoning a special needs infant to caretakers so you can pursue "loftier ambitions" is bad parenting. Again, her crappy parenting is not relevant except she is a public figure, wants to fuck up my nation and is seeking office in this sleazy, sub rosa way of hers in part by banging on her credentials as a mom.
 
 
You truely are a fucked up bitch.
You can not defend your sleazy behavior.
 
 
How Sarah Palin or anyone else manages their kids is none of your fucking business as long as they are doing it legally.

This is exactly what she did with me... on the Thomas thread. If you don't agree with her, you are an 'apologist' or a 'defender' of the opposite viewpoint. The woman is an idiot.

You should learn to differentiate between your opinion and fact.

Fact: Lots of women choose to have children in their forties. It is no one else's business.

Fact: Downs Syndrome is not that big a deal.

Fact: Millions of women choose to work and bring up children at the same time.

All of these 'issues' are ones you have created to justify your manic hatred of a woman who you disagree with politically. Idiot.
 
 
Well, downs syndrome not being a big deal can pretty much be downgraded to opinion.
 
 
 
 
 
The point is, Palin wants to be POTUS, Trajan. She whores out these kids of hers all over the media and then when one acts the fool we all have to pretend she's still Mother Of The Year?

Fuck that. She's raising a bigot and I find that abhorent.

Mamma Grizzly is a fuck up as a parent... that is the point.

 

It's unfair to make a judgment on a teenager being a bigot, and by extension the parent's parenting skills, if--in the middle of an internet spat--the teen calls someone who's ripping on her family a faggot.

sheesh, so much hate can't be good for you.  
 
 
 
Well, downs syndrome not being a big deal can pretty much be downgraded to opinion.

 

I have two family members with Downs. It isn't that big a deal. They both manage perfectly fine. Of course, with everything, there are degrees of Downs, but, generally speaking, these kids do fine.

Right, being that there are degress of downs would make that an opinion. I also have Family members. It's not a simple thing, the sisters require 100% of the time supervision. That's not easy.

But Maddie is criticizing Palin for having given birth to a Downs Syndrome child. Personally, I find that incredibly offensive and breathtakingly stupid. Who the hell is she to decide who should be born and who should not?

It's Maddie's continuous double standard that I find intolerable. Poor minorities who have kids out of wedlock, at 17... That's fine... We should do everything we can to help them... Bristol Palin does it and the whole family should be condemned. 16 year old kids mouth off on social networking sites all the time... but this one is Willow Palin... so again, it's a huge issue. Sarah Palin has a Downs Syndrome kid and that makes her a bad person - she dared to give birth to an 'imperfect' human being.

I'm amazed that anyone can defend Maddie's continual ranting hatred of anyone she disagrees with.

I bet if someone criticized one of the Obama kids, it would be a whole different story.
 
 
 
I'm the most bumfuddled by the man who shot his tv. Seriously? After 67 years, this is the one thing in the mass media you cannot abide?

And I thought I hated Palin......

 

He's an excellent Poster Loon for all of the PDS whackjobs.

And BTW, this is something Obama (nor any other politican I can think of) has ever done...."vote for me, I'm a great Mom" is unique to the Palin playbook, IMO.

Calling a woman a "cunt" is not a verbal act that reveals anyone's anti-woman bigotry IMO. You wanna imbue that word with more power than it deserves. Calling a youngster a "f*ggot", on the other hand, does reveal a homophobic bias. You may not like that these two are not the same egregious moral lapses, but that's life, Sheldon.

Relying on the USMB's own TOS for a logical reason why Palin's performance as a parent cannot be discussed is also a fail. Palin is not a USMB member -- she is a public figure. She wants to be POTUS and more'n a few people support her. She's a threat to this country and the very deceitful way she claims to be morally superior whilst deflecting any criticism of her moral lapses is one of the reasons I so despise her -- I find this woman to be canny but not smart, manipulative but not persuasive, jingoistic but not patriotic, etc.

Palin weaves her personal life and back story into her politics, Sheldon. She opposes abortion rights about as vehemently as it is possible to do -- more than most RCC clergy do -- and then waves her baby in the air. She opposes sex education in public schools and then shoves her single mom daughter into the limelight, and sees nothing at all hypocritical about allowing her to do up ads for condoms with a poster child for promiscuity. She attacks Obama as a "politican" and talks endlessly about how much she hates government -- how she'd rather be doing just about anything with her kids. Then she leaves the kids and runs around the country on a million dollar speaking tour, etc.

There's no way to have a full and frank discussion about Palin's suitability to serve as POTUS without drawing on examples of her hypocrisy, because that data is what I think most people are missing...and IMO, Palin is all about concealing her real motives and acts from public view whilst she dazzles the stupid with bullshit.

 

Holy shit, you can feel the hate oozing out of our computers.
sheesh, so much hate can't be good for you.  

 

The Madster is a hater; that's what she does best.
 
 
 
 
The whole point of being a decent human being is you don't go there, no matter how bad a jerk off the other guy is. What makes a jerk off is jerk off behavior, not that you don't agree with him on economic questions.

So open season on 0bama girls is out of the question.

But for those who think it is ok to rap on the Palins, I wish you would crawl back under your rock.

 

Bullshit. Palin cannot bang on her alleged superior mothering, whore her kids out to the media and then claim they should be "off limits" when something they do in public view disgraces her. I'm not gonna be silenced by this goofy hide-the-pea routine, Baruch.

 

What matters in this life is not the behavior of others, but one's own behavior.

I don't buy into the notion she is doing this, but even if she were, you don't race her to the bottom.
 
 
 
 
 
Where did she do that...I recall her criticizing Palin for not staying home with her retarded child but not what you are claiming.

 

She argued that very point in another thread...for pages...before it got shut down and deleted.

 

I don't think so...she didn't say what CG is claiming though I know a lot of the rightwingloons claimed she did.

 

Let's put it this way: When I asked her a direct question if women who intend on having unprotected sex (with their husbands or otherwise) after the age of 35 should be forced to use BC and/or sterilized if they also intend on continuing to work, she responded in the affirmative.

Fuck that sort of authoritarianism.

(Looking for her post but I can't find the thread, even.)
 
 
 
 
 
I do appreciate the time and energy you dedicate to defending Palin, Sheldon. It's very appealing at first blush, this cry to "leave the kids alone", except that........

Palin has leveraged her oldest child's teen pregnancy into some sort of martyrdom and Bristol is now a public figure in her own right. The search phrase "bristol palin magazine interviews" returns about 6,080,000 results on Google. She's a reality tv star and has been on the covers of various magazines. The Palins cannot shove Bristol out into the limelight as a spokesmodel for safe sex (?) or any other high moral principle and then demand that all discussion of hypocrisy on her part will remain unspoken of.

Palin has also leveraged her youngest child as grounds for claiming she has a special claim to extraordinary consideration as a mother that the parents of normal, healthy children do not share. We did discuss this on a thread the Mod Squad has pulled, though I still dunno why. Once again, the hypocrisy thing: if you claim the moral high ground on some biographic basis and your private life reveals you do not adhere to the principles you claim to embody, that is discussion-worthy.

In this thread, she claimed that having a child in your forties is "irresponsible". For what reason is it irresponsible, unless it is because the risk of having a Downs Syndrome baby increases significantly at that age? What other reason does one have for calling a 40+ Mom irresponsible?

I'm guessing that if another stupid fucking thread like this one shows up, then yes.

Yes she did. She ranted for pages and pages that Palin was a bad mother for "being so irresponsible" That she brought a downs baby into the world. Either by not aborting...or by having the nerve to get pregnant in her forties.

Arnold, Jesse.....and Sonny:

 
Landham was born in Canton, Georgia. He is a descendant of the Cherokee and Seminole nations.

In 2003, Landham ran in the Republican Party primary election for the post of Governor of Kentucky, hoping to repeat the success of his Predator castmates Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura and California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. He based his candidacy on opposition to an amendment which endorsed the Kentucky Family Court, saying his bad experiences at the hands of the family court had convinced him that it was run for the benefit of lawyers rather than families or children. He was unsuccessful in gaining the party's nomination. He ran briefly as an independent candidate, but withdrew on June 18, and endorsed the Republican slate.

In January 2004, Landham announced his candidacy for the 27th State Senate District of Kentucky.

In 2005, Landham spoke at a Council of Conservative Citizens convention. Landham has also appeared on the CofCC-affiliated radio show, The Political Cesspool.

In the Spring of 2006, Landham also accepted a bid as an honorary member of Alpha Sigma Phi, Beta Chi Chapter at American University.

On September 19, 2006, Landham was injured in a four-car accident in Ashland, Kentucky.[4]

On June 25, 2008, Landham announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate seat currently held by Mitch McConnell on the Libertarian line.[5] The same day Landham called for genocide against Arabs and referred to them as "ragheads". His comments were made on the political radio show the Weekly Filibuster.[6] Three days later, on June 28, the Kentucky Libertarians voted unanimously to withdraw Landham's nomination, citing his comments were not in keeping with the party's platform and values.[7]

Still waiting for evidence that Palin's racist, given her Indian hubby and kids.

Or that Willow is anything but a dumb teenager who wrote something goofy on her facebook. Which wasn't even an attack on faggots, but an attack on the pigs who attack her family.
 
 
 
 
I'm the most bumfuddled by the man who shot his tv. Seriously? After 67 years, this is the one thing in the mass media you cannot abide?

And I thought I hated Palin......

 

He's an excellent Poster Loon for all of the PDS whackjobs.

 

Whatever he is, what a sad end to what most likely was a law abiding life of dignity and hard work. He reminds me of this fuckwhit.....

Yes, true. Todd Palin's family has some Native blood and are entitled to certain benefits because of it. I dun think this qualifies her as a friend to Native peoples or to any people of color, and it doesn't immunize her from criticism for the racial rhetoric she spews.
 
 
LOL, Palin was ELECTED Governor of Alaska with a 80% approval rating.

so I'd say that INCLUDES the native population up there.

but hey, spin spin spin the shit out of things.

So what? Does this immunize her from criticism for her racist attacks on the Obamas? Does it suggest to you she'd be a friend to the Cherokee or any other tribe in the lower 48?

Your reasoning seems to be more or less that Sarah Palin is the third rail of the 2012 POTUS race and no one can touch her for fear of being slammed.

Fuck that, Stephanie. Build her up into a sacred cow if you like....to me, she's just a cow.

yeah, that is what has you lefties panties all in a bunch over her, she HAS THE NEVE, to criticize your alls "boyking" Obama.  
 
 
I have seen her sort before, Stephanie. She's a direct descendant of Joe McCarthy and Jimmy Swaggart and Anita Bryant and every other right wing demagogue we've been afflicted with in my lifetime.

Her campaign will divide us, play on our fears and cause immeasurable pain to many on both sides of the aisle. Other conservatives before her have tried to play the "us against them" card but not like she will. Hers will not be a campaign of ideas and solutions -- it will be about who "really" has the right to call themselves "American" and live well in this country.....and it will not be people of color, nor folks like me neither.

We'll be decades getting past the discord and bullshit this woman plans to poison us with.

I wish with all my heart you Palin worshippers would read Sinclair Lewis' Elmer Gantry and get a eye opener on religious-based propagandizing before it is too late.

Oh... so now you are going to start in with the race card...typical. This of course wouldn't have anything do with the many smear campaigns brought on by the Native Corporations around Alaska that had many huge projects in the works that were being funded by big oil and had been soaking the state for decades. At the time Sarah took over as governor and cleaned house...Alaska's state legislature was in the back pocket of these crooks.

Nope she never did anything good for the people of Alaska...

For God's sakes, she's married to an enrolled tribal member, last I heard.

 

Yes, true. Todd Palin's family has some Native blood and are entitled to certain benefits because of it. I dun think this qualifies her as a friend to Native peoples or to any people of color, and it doesn't immunize her from criticism for the racial rhetoric she spews.

 

That's because you're an idiot. Racists do not marry and have children with the races they despise.

And I'm still waiting for evidence of her racism.
 
 
 
I have seen her sort before, Stephanie. She's a direct descendant of Joe McCarthy and Jimmy Swaggart and Anita Bryant and every other right wing demagogue we've been afflicted with in my lifetime.

Her campaign will divide us, play on our fears and cause immeasurable pain to many on both sides of the aisle. Other conservatives before her have tried to play the "us against them" card but not like she will. Hers will not be a campaign of ideas and solutions -- it will be about who "really" has the right to call themselves "American" and live well in this country.....and it will not be people of color, nor folks like me neither.

We'll be decades getting past the discord and bullshit this woman plans to poison us with.

I wish with all my heart you Palin worshippers would read Sinclair Lewis' Elmer Gantry and get a eye opener on religious-based propagandizing before it is too late.

 

This whole rant of yours is exactly what you are all about Madeline. Playing on fears...dividing people...telling others who can and can't be considered "a good mother" "a good feminist" " a good christian" "worthwhile"...etc..etc.. I still don't know where you get off judging everyone else and then claiming the moral high road. You are so full of shit...

You friggen lefties DIVIDED US all during the Bush years. so don't give us this song and dance about how we "should all come together now, because it's the Obama. AND for your information, we'll be decades getting over the DIVIDER IN CHIEF you all put in the white house. I just hope we can SURVIVE THAT LONG before he's GONE..

 

And the right didn't divide us during the Clinton years? Give me a break.
When you guys divide us, you spout crap about who is really a true patriot or american. I really want to know how one decides what part of the US represents the real America.
 
 
MADeline who do the fuck do you think you are judging someone based on whether they are a good mother or not?

How about using a mirror instead of a microscope.

Did anyone besides Sarah Palin ever say that? about the real americans...
 
 
Ever notice how Palin's kids are always with here on the stage, maybe she should be with them when they are home. I saw that she put up a 2 ft gate that was to keep the baby off the stairs and as she also put it to keep boys out of her daughters rooms. yeah that will stop it Palin, just put up a fence and then nobody will be able to know whats going on and everybody will have to abide, even your kids boy friends.

Oh by the way I have watch her on DWS and she really does suck as a dancer, and she surly isn't what I would call a BABE. So that makes me believe one thing, the show is a farsce.

DWS is a stupid competition when the worst dancer can make people who are much better be eliminated because of who that person is, not what they can do. Anyone remember Buzz, all I could say was OMG, how can this be. Just once put your kid, wife, husband,friend or yourself in the shoes of those who get screwed in this way.
 
 
At least Sarah doesn't call her grandmother a typical white person.

No it's not crooked, it's just unfair. But of course you don't understand what unfair means. It's win at all cost.

Using your kids for poto ops everytime is sad. Yes at times it does happen on special events but not every time there are camera's there. I really wonder how much time she spends with them when nobody holding a camera is around to film it.

omg, it's gotta be the end of the world.

So is Palin the only politician that uses her kids for photo ops? Nope. As a matter of fact, most do it. Do you also wonder about how they treat their kids or is it just Palin?

Idiot.

I can.

I suspect Maddie will struggle with the concept.
 
 
Brandi?
I don't know of who you are talking about, but if she comes under the same top, then her also.

If your there because of what you have accomplished is one thing, but because your related or know someone, no thanks. Then if your kept there even tho you not any good all it does is cheapen the show and basically turns off those who are really there to watch DWS because of the talent.

for those of us that dont throw fits of rage at every word the woman utters, would you please show some proof of her "racial" remarks that you find so offensive

PS: i dont know if anyone pointed this out to you as i didnt read every page of this thread, but Willow is NOT the 16 year old, that's Piper

Maddie, still waiting for evidence of any but your own racism, evinced by your sneering implication that Todd, rather than being an enrolled tribal member who receives benefits the tribes bargained for IN RETURN FOR vast tracts of land, is somehow on the "dole" for sinking so low as to accept those benefits....

So please, please. Enlighten us about Sarah's racism. While you're at it, make some rude comments about how she should have aborted her baby because she was "too old" to have one (heaven knows nobody else has ever had a little surprise after they thought their families were complete...me included, pregnant at 39! OMG! I should have aborted, I may have given birth to a monster!) and how "uncomfortable" she appears in the hundreds of pictures we have of her holding her baby (usually in the background of another picture)..while at the same time you claim she delegates all care of the baby to a nanny, leaves the kid alone with unloving mother substitutes, subjects the rest of us to the uncomfortable reality of handicapped children...and also showing your incredible ignorance about what are telling signs of babies with down's syndrome. Namely that they are limp and unresponsive as infants, learn to crawl and creep at a later age, and are quite difficult to hold as they get past their infancy due to the fact that they don't exactly cling so much as just hang there.....

Yes, unfair would be like having to compete on DWTS with professional dancers...like say... Jennifer Grey...when you have never danced before and are not a known celeb. And then have the nitwit fans and judges expect you to be just as good. Or they call you a "fat ass" among other choice words LOL

Who cares if the fans call in to keep Bristol on the show. Apparently they think she is likeable. God knows she has a ton of guts (kudos to her) knowing assholes like you are out there hoping she falls on her ass.

And since you really have no idea what goes on with Sarah when the cameras aren't running...Maybe you shouldn't assume things...ya know??  

There are plenty of public figures that actually do go out in PUBLIC (OMG!!!) With their family. So what?? They cant control what the idiot poparazzi point their cameras at 24/7.

As for it being "a lousy, despicable thing to do" to point out the emperor has no clothes, build your own third rail, Baruch. I am not buying what you are selling. It all seems like faux outrage to me unless you ALSO condemn Palin's endless attempts to claim some sort of moral high ground by climbing on her kids.

2) She's beautiful

Two claims you could NEVER make. Ya' bitter old witch.

He's an excellent Poster Loon for all of the PDS whackjobs.

 

Whatever he is, what a sad end to what most likely was a law abiding life of dignity and hard work. He reminds me of this fuckwhit.....

 Muslim woman was cursed and spat on in Walmart | Islamophobia Today eNewspaper 

There is something desperate in US politics these days I have not seen since the 1960's. The level of anger and hysteria among decent people -- especially mature folks -- is breath-taking.

 

Oh this brings back fond memories of my days as a program manager for diminished capacity fuckwits....

We had one particularly crazy, violent and epileptic dude. We really did love him but he was off the charts nuts. Completely insane.

So as part of his "life plan" which is the plan we devise that addresses all aspects of the lives of these poor souls, and in doing so, attempts to fulfill as much of what constitutes a "normal" life as possible, this lunatic got to go shopping with our unfortunate staff.

So he wigged out at walmart. He grabbed a knife, called the workers all sorts of names, threatened to stab himself, and repeatedly spat in the face of the female staff member accompanying him.

Good times. As I told her..."Never get close enough to be spit upon or hit."

Words to live by, let me tell you.

PS: i dont know if anyone pointed this out to you as i didnt read every page of this thread, but Willow is NOT the 16 year old, that's Piper

 

Willow is 16, Divey. Track was born in 1989 and Trig in 2008; Bristol was born in 1990, Willow in 1994 and Piper in 2001.

 Sarah Palin - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 

BTW, facebook has evidentially received complaints about Willow's use of homophobic slurs and has responded publically.....

 
The social network that is home to 500 million users addresses Willows use of the words f**got and calling someone gay while defending her mother!

Facebook is finally responding to Willow Palins homophobic slurs on Nov. 14 when she called another user gay and a f**got while defending her familys new show, Sarah Palins Alaska! In a letter to HollywoodLife a Facebook spokesperson said, We want Facebook to be a place where people can openly discuss issues and express their views, while respecting the rights and feelings of others.

They went on to note, Facebook is highly self-regulating, and people can and do report content that they find questionable or offensive. We take our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities very seriously and react quickly to reports of content and behavior that violate our policies. Specifically, were sensitive to content that singles out private individuals, or that includes pornography, direct statements of hate, or actionable threats of violence.

This makes it clear Willows actions, however ill advised, will not be landing the 16-year-old in any sort of serious trouble. We are sure mom Sarah Palin is very relieved to hear that!

Yes, true. Todd Palin's family has some Native blood and are entitled to certain benefits because of it. I dun think this qualifies her as a friend to Native peoples or to any people of color, and it doesn't immunize her from criticism for the racial rhetoric she spews.

 

for those of us that dont throw fits of rage at every word the woman utters, would you please show some proof of her "racial" remarks that you find so offensive

PS: i dont know if anyone pointed this out to you as i didnt read every page of this thread, but Willow is NOT the 16 year old, that's Piper

 

Willow is 16, Divey. Track was born in 1989 and Trig in 2008; Bristol was born in 1990, Willow in 1994 and Piper in 2001.

 Sarah Palin - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 

BTW, facebook has evidentially received complaints about Willow's use of homophobic slurs and has responded publically.....

 
The social network that is home to 500 million users addresses Willows use of the words f**got and calling someone gay while defending her mother!

Facebook is finally responding to Willow Palins homophobic slurs on Nov. 14 when she called another user gay and a f**got while defending her familys new show, Sarah Palins Alaska! In a letter to HollywoodLife a Facebook spokesperson said, We want Facebook to be a place where people can openly discuss issues and express their views, while respecting the rights and feelings of others.

They went on to note, Facebook is highly self-regulating, and people can and do report content that they find questionable or offensive. We take our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities very seriously and react quickly to reports of content and behavior that violate our policies. Specifically, were sensitive to content that singles out private individuals, or that includes pornography, direct statements of hate, or actionable threats of violence.

This makes it clear Willows actions, however ill advised, will not be landing the 16-year-old in any sort of serious trouble. We are sure mom Sarah Palin is very relieved to hear that!

I never said I had proof...you mix me up with someone else. I simply said I don't believe him.

None of your dancing around takes away from the fact that you wrote porn about Obama's daughters...you piece of shit.

 

 

Yeah, wrote it in jest, as everybody up here knows.......It fully exposed you as being just as big a heartless bitch as Madeline is.......Ya' lil wench.

Where's the proof of con hogs lack of service.......You made the claims, moron....Prove it!

Or were you lying to me in private.........?  

 

Jest or not, porn is porn. You wrote porn about children.

You are beyond suck.

You think there might just be an ulterior motive the HuffPuff to "report" on Palin's alleged racism? Wouldn't have anything to do with the HuffPuff being an openly biased left wing 'news' site?

God Almightly, Maddie, you are either breathtakingly naive or just seriously stupid.

It still contains a number of blog and OpEds. It seems to me that - just like some people cannot tell the difference between a news show and a comment show, they also cannot tell the difference between a news article written by a reporter and a blog or OpEd written by someone with no journalistic integrity, and a clear agenda.

Yep, you have a point there. If, and I say if Palin made a "racist" comment it doesn't come close to that racist church obie wan sat in for 20 years. He tries to tell us he was deaf as a doorknob too but I don't believe him do you?

So? Attacking children is now ok according to you sad fuckers.
 
 
 
 
 
The point is, Palin wants to be POTUS, Trajan. She whores out these kids of hers all over the media and then when one acts the fool we all have to pretend she's still Mother Of The Year?

Fuck that. She's raising a bigot and I find that abhorent.

Mamma Grizzly is a fuck up as a parent... that is the point.

 

It's unfair to make a judgment on a teenager being a bigot, and by extension the parent's parenting skills, if--in the middle of an internet spat--the teen calls someone who's ripping on her family a faggot.

I've seen you throw around the cunt slur against some female posters on here, so by your own measure that must mean you're a woman-hating bigot.

If I remember right, you started another thread awhile back about her kids, in the FZ I think, and you also took the time to make that video about "Palin steak". What you're doing with threads like these is the USMB equivalent of those 501 (C) attack ads that are nothing more than slimy ad homs that hit outside of politics.

Bashing a politician's or public figure's family or personal life, even if their life and family is visible, is the dregs of discourse... if it can even be called that. It's like the rules here; you can go after family if that person brings it up... but even though it's allowed I still think it's tacky and smarmy to go after family anyways. It shows a lack of ammo from the attacker, that they have to stoop to that level.

If her highly-visible and publicized political views are a threat to this country, go after her politics. But hitting outside of her politics and going after her as a mom says more about what type of person you are than what type of parent she is.

Self-awareness is for winners, and you're looking the bitter fool with this Palin obsession. For real. You're the mirror version of USArmyFail when it comes to Palin. Think about it.

 

I do appreciate the time and energy you dedicate to defending Palin, Sheldon. It's very appealing at first blush, this cry to "leave the kids alone", except that........

Palin has leveraged her oldest child's teen pregnancy into some sort of martyrdom and Bristol is now a public figure in her own right. The search phrase "bristol palin magazine interviews" returns about 6,080,000 results on Google. She's a reality tv star and has been on the covers of various magazines. The Palins cannot shove Bristol out into the limelight as a spokesmodel for safe sex (?) or any other high moral principle and then demand that all discussion of hypocrisy on her part will remain unspoken of.

Palin has also leveraged her youngest child as grounds for claiming she has a special claim to extraordinary consideration as a mother that the parents of normal, healthy children do not share. We did discuss this on a thread the Mod Squad has pulled, though I still dunno why. Once again, the hypocrisy thing: if you claim the moral high ground on some biographic basis and your private life reveals you do not adhere to the principles you claim to embody, that is discussion-worthy.

Palin makes so many references to her children and her motherhood, it's hard to keep track of them all. How many times has she said the phrase "Momma Grizzlies" alone? She cannot bang on her reproductive talents and then expect her parenting skills are beyond the pale by those who find fault with her, as a politican. And BTW, this is something Obama (nor any other politican I can think of) has ever done...."vote for me, I'm a great Mom" is unique to the Palin playbook, IMO.

Calling a woman a "cunt" is not a verbal act that reveals anyone's anti-woman bigotry IMO. You wanna imbue that word with more power than it deserves. Calling a youngster a "f*ggot", on the other hand, does reveal a homophobic bias. You may not like that these two are not the same egregious moral lapses, but that's life, Sheldon.

Relying on the USMB's own TOS for a logical reason why Palin's performance as a parent cannot be discussed is also a fail. Palin is not a USMB member -- she is a public figure. She wants to be POTUS and more'n a few people support her. She's a threat to this country and the very deceitful way she claims to be morally superior whilst deflecting any criticism of her moral lapses is one of the reasons I so despise her -- I find this woman to be canny but not smart, manipulative but not persuasive, jingoistic but not patriotic, etc.

Palin weaves her personal life and back story into her politics, Sheldon. She opposes abortion rights about as vehemently as it is possible to do -- more than most RCC clergy do -- and then waves her baby in the air. She opposes sex education in public schools and then shoves her single mom daughter into the limelight, and sees nothing at all hypocritical about allowing her to do up ads for condoms with a poster child for promiscuity. She attacks Obama as a "politican" and talks endlessly about how much she hates government -- how she'd rather be doing just about anything with her kids. Then she leaves the kids and runs around the country on a million dollar speaking tour, etc.

There's no way to have a full and frank discussion about Palin's suitability to serve as POTUS without drawing on examples of her hypocrisy, because that data is what I think most people are missing...and IMO, Palin is all about concealing her real motives and acts from public view whilst she dazzles the stupid with bullshit.

 

More smurf vomit from Blue's Clueless.  

I stopped reading after the second paragraph, after it became obvious that whole wall of text is just you trying to hoodwink yourself into thinking you have a righteous position here.

You don't. Try to justify your nonesense all you want, it'll only make you look like a clueless fool even more. Step back, look at the sheer length of that post, and realize you have a problem. It's the first step.  
 
 
How about that time Sarah Palin said that Obama was a "light skinned" African-American "with no Negro dialect, unless he wanted to have one"?

It is, Divey. But so is the Tallahassee Democrat and Chronicle and more yellow journalism you never saw in your life. Still, it has a plant, employs reporters and editors and is a media outlet.

By contrast, a blog is the (usually) unpaid, unsupervised, unedited work of a single person who feels the need to exhibit every stray thought they have to the world.

Yes, true. Todd Palin's family has some Native blood and are entitled to certain benefits because of it. I dun think this qualifies her as a friend to Native peoples or to any people of color, and it doesn't immunize her from criticism for the racial rhetoric she spews.

 

for those of us that dont throw fits of rage at every word the woman utters, would you please show some proof of her "racial" remarks that you find so offensive

PS: i dont know if anyone pointed this out to you as i didnt read every page of this thread, but Willow is NOT the 16 year old, that's Piper

 

Willow is 16, Divey. Track was born in 1989 and Trig in 2008; Bristol was born in 1990, Willow in 1994 and Piper in 2001.

 Sarah Palin - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 

BTW, facebook has evidentially received complaints about Willow's use of homophobic slurs and has responded publically.....

 
The social network that is home to 500 million users addresses Willows use of the words f**got and calling someone gay while defending her mother!

Facebook is finally responding to Willow Palins homophobic slurs on Nov. 14 when she called another user gay and a f**got while defending her familys new show, Sarah Palins Alaska!

This makes it clear Willows actions, however ill advised, will not be landing the 16-year-old in any sort of serious trouble. We are sure mom Sarah Palin is very relieved to hear that!

I came to this board only recently. Do people here know that David Axlerod's son became a Huff Po employee upon graduating from I think it was a school of journalism in Colorado?

So Axelrod can pull the strings right from the WH at Huff Po.
 
 
 
 
A Wisconsin man was held on Wednesday for holding police at bay for 15 hours after shooting out his television in a rage over Bristol Palin's performance on TV's "Dancing with the Stars."

The standoff in the central Wisconsin town of Vermont ended peacefully Tuesday with the arrest of Steven Cowan, 67, on charges of reckless endangerment.

According to a criminal complaint, Cowan shouted an expletive, took out a shotgun and shot into his television during an airing of the popular reality show.

The object of his ire was Bristol Palin, a contestant on the popular ABC show and the daughter of former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin.

Cowan didn't consider her a good dancer, Cowan's wife, Janice, told authorities, according to the complaint.

Fearing that she might be the next target, Janice Cowan went to the local police department and the standoff ensued.

Other viewers of the show voted to promote Palin into the next round.

Bristol Palin was propositioned by "Dancing with the Stars" rival Mike "The Situation" Sorrentino of "Jersey Shore" fame backstage, who went so far as to whip out some condoms.

But it wasn't for real -- it was a public service announcement to promote safe sex.

In the commercial, Palin -- whose mother Sarah was the last Republican vice presidential candidate and is a leader of the conservative Tea Party movement -- rebuffs The Situation's advances, saying, "I avoid situations."

The spotlight fell on Bristol Palin during the 2008 presidential campaign when her teen-age pregnancy became known. The single mother now advocates sexual abstinence.

Palin and The Situation made the ad for the Candie's Foundation, whose goal is to reduce teen pregnancy. Palin became an ambassador for the organization last year.

In the ad, The Situation, who gained fame in MTV's reality show "Jersey Shore," bumps into Palin backstage and starts hitting on her.

Sarah Palin's 16-year-old daughter Willow Palin used multiple homophobic slurs -- including the word f**got -- to attack a Facebook user who criticized her mom's new reality show.... TMZ has learned.

During the premiere of "Sarah Palin's Alaska" Sunday night -- a boy named Tre who went to school with the Palin kids wrote a status update that read, "Sarah Palin's Alaska, is failing so hard right now."

The comment sparked an intense response from Willow -- who replied on the boy's wall, "Haha your so gay. I have no idea who you are, But what I've seen pictures of, your disgusting... My sister had a kid and is still hot."

Willow followed up that comment with another that read, "Tre stfu. Your such a f**got."

Bristol Palin also got in on the smacktalk -- writing a message to Tre saying, "You're running your mouth just to talk sh*t."

Eventually, a message board war erupted -- and Bristol took aim at another person named Jon -- saying, "You'll be as successful as my baby daddy, And actually I do work my ass off. I've been a single mom for the last two years."

After more users began to gang up on the Palins, Willow dropped another message that read, "Sorry that you guys are all jealous of my families success and you guys aren't goin to go anywhere with your lives."

Sources connected to the Palin family tell us... Willow normally doesn't use this type of language, but she felt like she was being attacked along with her family. The source added it was the baby bear defending Mama Grizzly.

I scarcely know where to begin.........

Your thoughts?

 

This OP is simply disgusting and frankly, stupid. And a hodgepodge of personal attacks on people or children somehow related to Palin. I tell you what Madeline, How about you attack Palin on policy and see how that works for ya?
 
 
 
How about that time Sarah Palin said that Obama was a "light skinned" African-American "with no Negro dialect, unless he wanted to have one"?

 

lol

it appears Harry can get away with this shit....

Good show.

 
 
 
 
I'm the most bumfuddled by the man who shot his tv. Seriously? After 67 years, this is the one thing in the mass media you cannot abide?

And I thought I hated Palin......

 

If you HATE Palin, then she OWNS YOU  
 
 
 
 
 
I do appreciate the time and energy you dedicate to defending Palin, Sheldon. It's very appealing at first blush, this cry to "leave the kids alone", except that........

Palin has leveraged her oldest child's teen pregnancy into some sort of martyrdom and Bristol is now a public figure in her own right. The search phrase "bristol palin magazine interviews" returns about 6,080,000 results on Google. She's a reality tv star and has been on the covers of various magazines. The Palins cannot shove Bristol out into the limelight as a spokesmodel for safe sex (?) or any other high moral principle and then demand that all discussion of hypocrisy on her part will remain unspoken of.

Palin has also leveraged her youngest child as grounds for claiming she has a special claim to extraordinary consideration as a mother that the parents of normal, healthy children do not share. We did discuss this on a thread the Mod Squad has pulled, though I still dunno why. Once again, the hypocrisy thing: if you claim the moral high ground on some biographic basis and your private life reveals you do not adhere to the principles you claim to embody, that is discussion-worthy.

Palin makes so many references to her children and her motherhood, it's hard to keep track of them all. How many times has she said the phrase "Momma Grizzlies" alone? She cannot bang on her reproductive talents and then expect her parenting skills are beyond the pale by those who find fault with her, as a politican. And BTW, this is something Obama (nor any other politican I can think of) has ever done...."vote for me, I'm a great Mom" is unique to the Palin playbook, IMO.

Calling a woman a "cunt" is not a verbal act that reveals anyone's anti-woman bigotry IMO. You wanna imbue that word with more power than it deserves. Calling a youngster a "f*ggot", on the other hand, does reveal a homophobic bias. You may not like that these two are not the same egregious moral lapses, but that's life, Sheldon.

Relying on the USMB's own TOS for a logical reason why Palin's performance as a parent cannot be discussed is also a fail. Palin is not a USMB member -- she is a public figure. She wants to be POTUS and more'n a few people support her. She's a threat to this country and the very deceitful way she claims to be morally superior whilst deflecting any criticism of her moral lapses is one of the reasons I so despise her -- I find this woman to be canny but not smart, manipulative but not persuasive, jingoistic but not patriotic, etc.

Palin weaves her personal life and back story into her politics, Sheldon. She opposes abortion rights about as vehemently as it is possible to do -- more than most RCC clergy do -- and then waves her baby in the air. She opposes sex education in public schools and then shoves her single mom daughter into the limelight, and sees nothing at all hypocritical about allowing her to do up ads for condoms with a poster child for promiscuity. She attacks Obama as a "politican" and talks endlessly about how much she hates government -- how she'd rather be doing just about anything with her kids. Then she leaves the kids and runs around the country on a million dollar speaking tour, etc.

There's no way to have a full and frank discussion about Palin's suitability to serve as POTUS without drawing on examples of her hypocrisy, because that data is what I think most people are missing...and IMO, Palin is all about concealing her real motives and acts from public view whilst she dazzles the stupid with bullshit.

 

More smurf vomit from Blue's Clueless.  

I stopped reading after the second paragraph, after it became obvious that whole wall of text is just you trying to hoodwink yourself into thinking you have a righteous position here.

You don't. Try to justify your nonesense all you want, it'll only make you look like a clueless fool even more. Step back, look at the sheer length of that post, and realize you have a problem. It's the first step.  

 

Yeah, Madeline - you have to dumb it down for the Rightwing on this board.

Talk in sound bites: that's what they are used to hearing from their 'leaders'.

 

In that entire rant she provided not one single example, an iota of evidence, that anything that she said is true. No links, no quotes. Sorry, the right doesn't just go on the vile and hateful ramblings of the left, who have proved again and again that not only are the liars, but that they don't even understand the concept of truth.

Madeline's primary gripe with Palin is now and always has been that she is a professional woman who dares to have children, and who (gasp) doesn't hide those children away or refuse to talk about them. I have yet to meet a mother who doesn't love to talk about her kids, and the more kids you have, the more you talk about them. You make decisions based upon them, your politics are influenced by them, and that irritates Madeline no end. She not only hates children (you'll have to take my word for it, the way you have to take Madeline's word for her vile spewings) but even more, she hates mothers who leave the house to pursue careers.
 
 
 
 
 
The point is, Palin wants to be POTUS, Trajan. She whores out these kids of hers all over the media and then when one acts the fool we all have to pretend she's still Mother Of The Year?

Fuck that. She's raising a bigot and I find that abhorent.

Mamma Grizzly is a fuck up as a parent... that is the point.

 

It's unfair to make a judgment on a teenager being a bigot, and by extension the parent's parenting skills, if--in the middle of an internet spat--the teen calls someone who's ripping on her family a faggot.

I've seen you throw around the cunt slur against some female posters on here, so by your own measure that must mean you're a woman-hating bigot.

If I remember right, you started another thread awhile back about her kids, in the FZ I think, and you also took the time to make that video about "Palin steak". What you're doing with threads like these is the USMB equivalent of those 501 (C) attack ads that are nothing more than slimy ad homs that hit outside of politics.

Bashing a politician's or public figure's family or personal life, even if their life and family is visible, is the dregs of discourse... if it can even be called that. It's like the rules here; you can go after family if that person brings it up... but even though it's allowed I still think it's tacky and smarmy to go after family anyways. It shows a lack of ammo from the attacker, that they have to stoop to that level.

If her highly-visible and publicized political views are a threat to this country, go after her politics. But hitting outside of her politics and going after her as a mom says more about what type of person you are than what type of parent she is.

Self-awareness is for winners, and you're looking the bitter fool with this Palin obsession. For real. You're the mirror version of USArmyFail when it comes to Palin. Think about it.

Excellent post!
 
 
So calling someone a faggot is WORSE than calling a woman a Cxxt.

We see how the left has now taken to dumping on CHILDREN, especially if they are the Palin children. I think Maddie is really Joy Behar, that ugly leftie was also dumping on a child.

the left crawls so low, a snake doesn't even compete.
 
 
 
You truely are a fucked up bitch.
You can not defend your sleazy behavior.

 

Uh, CMike....Sarah Palin is not actually here on the boards. You'll have to send that to her Facebook page, or publicist, or something.

All the "cunt" word means is "woman". "F*ggot", on the other hand, is a slur on someone's sexuality. If they are gay, it denigrates them and if they aren't, it is a denial of their sexual identity.

I dunno why you cannot wrap you pea brain around this and frankly, you are no poster child for high morals, Stephanie. If I looked at every conservative as someone as honest, compassionate and thoughtful as you I'd be condemning whole swaths of people myself.

Fortunately, I don't. I think you're unique...sort of. The rabid dog type the Religious Right is so anxious to recruit and wind up. A real American traitor.

When is Poor Sarah going to show Trig's birth certificate?

And when is someone going to come up with some photos of Poor Sarah "out to here" in her 7/8/9th months of pregnancy?

This is her at 7 months:

JUNEAU -- Gov. Sarah Palin shocked and awed just about everybody around the Capitol on Wednesday when she announced she's expecting her fifth child.

The governor, who recently turned 44, told a handful of reporters as she was leaving work to expect a new member of the first family, then headed to a reception at the Baranof Hotel to feast on king crab.

Palin said she's already about seven months along, with the baby due to arrive in mid-May.

That the pregnancy is so advanced astonished all who heard the news. The governor, a runner who's always been trim, simply doesn't look pregnant.

Even close members of her staff said they only learned this week their boss was expecting.

"I thought it was becoming obvious," Palin said. "You know, clothes getting snugger and snugger."

But people just couldn't believe the news.

"Really? No!" said Bethel state Rep. Mary Nelson, who is close to giving birth herself.

"It's wonderful. She's very well-disguised," said Senate President Lyda Green, a mother of three who has sometimes sparred with Palin politically. "When I was five months pregnant, there was absolutely no question that I was with child."

- Palin's daughter Bristol who attends an Anchorage high school, was reportedly absent for what would have been the last 4 -5 months of her mother's pregnancy, claiming to be suffering from a prolonged case of mono.

- Sarah Palin's water broke while she was attending a conference in Texas. She then proceeded to give a 30-minute speech before taking an 11-12 hour flight home to Alaska to give birth.

- All photos on the Alaska State Department's official website that show Sarah Palin and her family have been taken down.

What bullshittery. I m not opposed to Palin because she is a woman, or a mother, or a good looking woman in some people's eyes.

I am opposed to her because her opinions offend me in the deepest way possible. Because, if she were elected, she'd bring this nation into the Dark Ages. Because she is stupid and incompetent. Because, IMO, she has the morals of an alley cat.

I know more about Palin than I do about this twerp, but I plan to oppose him as well....

So, here are the facts:
*Fox News has exclusive video they have been showing on t.v. about the everyday life of Sarah while she was pregnant with Trig. During the show, she keeps asking,"where's Bristol?",and then at one point she tells her husband to call Bristol's phone. During the entire video, there is no footage of Bristol, even though she was supposed to be home sick with Mono.

I think the birth of Trig was perfectly described by a USMB member as, "Sacred Baby Syndrome". Sounds beautiful.
 
 
 
 
 
I hope she runs. That would be so much fun!
 
 
 
 
So calling someone a faggot is WORSE than calling a woman a Cxxt.

We see how the left has now taken to dumping on CHILDREN, especially if they are the Palin children. I think Maddie is really Joy Behar, that ugly leftie was also dumping on a child.

the left crawls so low, a snake doesn't even compete.

 

All the "cunt" word means is "woman". "F*ggot", on the other hand, is a slur on someone's sexuality. If they are gay, it denigrates them and if they aren't, it is a denial of their sexual identity.

 

Really?? I am a woman, I am NOT you  
You continually denigrate and eat your own Madeline, typical nasty post when it concerns women on the right. I lose more respect for you by the post

Allow me to edit my thoughts..... in reality, I lost complete respect for you a couple of months ago
 
 
 
What bullshittery. I m not opposed to Palin because she is a woman, or a mother, or a good looking woman in some people's eyes.

I am opposed to her because her opinions offend me in the deepest way possible. Because, if she were elected, she'd bring this nation into the Dark Ages. Because she is stupid and incompetent. Because, IMO, she has the morals of an alley cat.

I know more about Palin than I do about this twerp, but I plan to oppose him as well....

 Mike Huckabee lauds ousting of Iowa justices over gay marriage, courts evangelicals | cleveland.com 

I'm not gonna stand idly by whilst racism, sexism, stupidity and hate become the guiding lights for this nation's future.

 

Bullshit.

If that were the case for your seething hatred of her, then you would not attack her children and attack her for making a Choice to give birth to a Down Syndrome child while choosing to continue working.

Fail, liar.

Pig.

Sexist.

Idiot.

What amazes me is that it is not all that intellectually challenging to honestly attack Palin, yet Madeline does this shit continuously.
 
 
 
 
 
I do appreciate the time and energy you dedicate to defending Palin, Sheldon. It's very appealing at first blush, this cry to "leave the kids alone", except that........

Palin has leveraged her oldest child's teen pregnancy into some sort of martyrdom and Bristol is now a public figure in her own right. The search phrase "bristol palin magazine interviews" returns about 6,080,000 results on Google. She's a reality tv star and has been on the covers of various magazines. The Palins cannot shove Bristol out into the limelight as a spokesmodel for safe sex (?) or any other high moral principle and then demand that all discussion of hypocrisy on her part will remain unspoken of.

Palin has also leveraged her youngest child as grounds for claiming she has a special claim to extraordinary consideration as a mother that the parents of normal, healthy children do not share. We did discuss this on a thread the Mod Squad has pulled, though I still dunno why. Once again, the hypocrisy thing: if you claim the moral high ground on some biographic basis and your private life reveals you do not adhere to the principles you claim to embody, that is discussion-worthy.

Palin makes so many references to her children and her motherhood, it's hard to keep track of them all. How many times has she said the phrase "Momma Grizzlies" alone? She cannot bang on her reproductive talents and then expect her parenting skills are beyond the pale by those who find fault with her, as a politican. And BTW, this is something Obama (nor any other politican I can think of) has ever done...."vote for me, I'm a great Mom" is unique to the Palin playbook, IMO.

Calling a woman a "cunt" is not a verbal act that reveals anyone's anti-woman bigotry IMO. You wanna imbue that word with more power than it deserves. Calling a youngster a "f*ggot", on the other hand, does reveal a homophobic bias. You may not like that these two are not the same egregious moral lapses, but that's life, Sheldon.

Relying on the USMB's own TOS for a logical reason why Palin's performance as a parent cannot be discussed is also a fail. Palin is not a USMB member -- she is a public figure. She wants to be POTUS and more'n a few people support her. She's a threat to this country and the very deceitful way she claims to be morally superior whilst deflecting any criticism of her moral lapses is one of the reasons I so despise her -- I find this woman to be canny but not smart, manipulative but not persuasive, jingoistic but not patriotic, etc.

Palin weaves her personal life and back story into her politics, Sheldon. She opposes abortion rights about as vehemently as it is possible to do -- more than most RCC clergy do -- and then waves her baby in the air. She opposes sex education in public schools and then shoves her single mom daughter into the limelight, and sees nothing at all hypocritical about allowing her to do up ads for condoms with a poster child for promiscuity. She attacks Obama as a "politican" and talks endlessly about how much she hates government -- how she'd rather be doing just about anything with her kids. Then she leaves the kids and runs around the country on a million dollar speaking tour, etc.

There's no way to have a full and frank discussion about Palin's suitability to serve as POTUS without drawing on examples of her hypocrisy, because that data is what I think most people are missing...and IMO, Palin is all about concealing her real motives and acts from public view whilst she dazzles the stupid with bullshit.

I stopped reading after the second paragraph, after it became obvious that whole wall of text is just you trying to hoodwink yourself into thinking you have a righteous position here.

You don't. Try to justify your nonesense all you want, it'll only make you look like a clueless fool even more. Step back, look at the sheer length of that post, and realize you have a problem. It's the first step.  

 

Yeah, Madeline - you have to dumb it down for the Rightwing on this board.

Talk in sound bites: that's what they are used to hearing from their 'leaders'.

 

Keep swinging, brainiac.

I'm not a rightwinger, conservative, or Republican. I voted for Obama. If someone was trying to discredit him by going after him as a father, I'd be posting the same thing. It's called principle. Look the word up if you don't know what it means.

Thats assuming everything will be done above board  
 
 
On the day that anyone can explain how the fuck this is anyone's business other than the Palin family, I'll take a view on it. Until then, might I just say this.....

There are some seriously fucking deranged people in this country - and many of them do not have the last name Palin.
 
 
 
Palin will easily beat whoever the Dem Candidate is in 2012

 

Tell ya what Frank.......I'll make a bet with you........

If Palin runs and wins the WH, I will pos rep you once a week for a year.

If she runs and loses, or doesn't make it past the primaries? You pos rep me once a week for a year.

Put up or shut up. She's not gonna win, even if she does run.

BTW.........Wicked Jester took a bet like that for Christine O'Donnell.

oooooooooooooooooooooooo, Palin would take uS back to the DARK AGES.

I can't stand the Shrillery, but I don't DWELL on it DAY IN and DAY OUT.

Where did you get your fortune telling degree, Mrs. Cleo's school of predictions?
 
 
I can't get that link to work but I gather from others posts that this OP is repeating the vile garbage that Andrew Sullivan spread during the campaign.

That Todd Palin was the father of Bristol's baby take a choice Trig or Trip. Depending on what website you visit.

It's as disgusting and appalling today as it was then. For all the liberals who like to consider this family white trash, you should really look in the mirror and assess what type of person are you to conntinually spread lies about a family who's only sin is that they are all related to a woman you hate for her politics?

What type of person just hits the keyboards and with no proof whatsoever condemn a father and daughter of committing incest?

When you really can't stand one woman for her politics that you have to stoop this low it really is time for serious therapy.

Now put on your thinking cap Lil Old Lady, DNA tests are available to Levi Johnston He can clear up Trip's lineage at least and maybe parlay this rumour into more big bucks for himself.

If the rumour was true that Todd fathered Trip as well, Levi would have had that test taken lickety split to further spit in the eye of the Palin's and get his sorry ass out of child support.

Sheesh. You should be ashamed of yourself but you won't be.

I don't care.

I am sorry to hear that, Miss Pix. Politics is not now nor has it ever been a great place for those with delicate feelings.

And yes, "cunt" means nothing more or less than "adult human female". Like it or not, it is not a slur on anyone's morals.

The websites on this are crazy. Somehow, someway the theories abound that Trig is Bristol's baby fathered by her father and then the kid then gets knocked up by Levi and has Trip.

This is wilder than any episode of Twilight Zone meets Jerry Springer. And the white trash are the people spreading this rumour.

His kids are public figures; millions of people know who they are. I don't see either Palin or Obama claiming to be the world's greatest parent. Obama has brought his life as a dad into the public. Other politicians do it also; it helps to connect with voters.

Sara Palin Uncovered: Controversy Over Baby Trig News Type: Event  Seeded on Sun Nov 21, 2010

So, here are the facts:
*Fox News has exclusive video they have been showing on t.v. about the everyday life of Sarah while she was pregnant with Trig. During the show, she keeps asking,"where's Bristol?",and then at one point she tells her husband to call Bristol's phone. During the entire video, there is no footage of Bristol, even though she was supposed to be home sick with Mono.

Change that to OBAMA derangement syndrome, and you have the kind of shit we've been looking at posted by you partisan hacks for over two years. Cons have mastered hypocrisy to the point it could be considered sinful if it weren't such an obvious mental condition.
