The decision by the Madagascan president of the Highest Transitional Authority
(HAT), Andry Rajoelina, not to contest in the forthcoming presidential election
has triggered different responses from politicians in the Indian Ocean island
country.

Rajoelina's supporters are giving full backing to the decision, describing it as
wise and responsible.

Former president Albert Zafy, who heads one of the opposition camps, accuses the
36-year-old HAT president of confusing national issues with personal decisions.

"Nobody is telling him not to contest in the presidential election. I even
encourage him to be a candidate, but his current statements do not resolve the
Madagascan crisis," he said.

Mamy Rakotoarivelo of former president Marc Ravalomanana's camp and Ange
Andrianarisoa of former president Didier Ratsiraka's camp admitted that the
roadmap being suggested by Rajoelina is similar to what was recommended jointly
by France and South Africa.

"In any case, it is not the first time that Rajoelina has made such
declarations. It might appear good now, but he will soon change his mind.
Therefore why should anyone believe him?" Rakotoarivelo asked.

Gabriel Rabearimanana, who is the secretary general of the Monima party of Monja
Roindefo, the first prime minister under Rajoelina, also expressed reservations
about Rajoelina's statement.

He said he did not believe at all what Rajoelina declared. "On many occasions,
he has promised so much yet delivered nothing. He has even denied his own
signature."

Political leaders close to the Madagascan transitional government hailed
Rajoelina's decision. "No Madagascan leader, even in Africa, could take such a
decision. The transitional president has proven that national interests come
before any political calculations," said Jean Lahiniriko, who is the president
of the pro-government party UDR.

As for Rajoelina's TGV Association, they announced their participation in all
the elections.

"We have already agreed that TGV will be a grand national political party and we
are ready for the constitutional referendum as well as the presidential
elections. For the time being, we shall not say who will be our presidential
candidate, but we shall discuss that in the near future," the party's national
secretary Lanto Rakotomavo said.

Pierrot Rajaonarivelo of the Madagascar's Democratic Movement , who was also a
deputy prime minister during the reign of Ratsiraka, hailed the initiative of
Rajoelina.

"I must support such a decision not to contest in the presidential election.
Only politicians who are not seeking their own selfish interests will honor such
a decision," he said in a statement on Wednesday.

Roland Ratsiraka, president of the MTS party, suggested, however, that Rajoelina
should sign an official document to signify the seriousness of his statement.

"A new transitional charter should be drafted to guide the president until the
end of the transition," said Roland, who is also Didier Ratsiraka's nephew.

Rajoelina vowed not to run in the presidential race after failing again to
resolve differences with the three former presidents in the latest round of
talks South Africa.

According to the opposition parties, Rajoelina is simply imposing his unilateral
agenda including a national dialogue scheduled for May 27-29, a constitutional
referendum on Aug. 12, the legislative elections on Sept. 30 and the
presidential elections on Nov. 26.

Madagascar was thrown into turmoil towards the end of 2008 and this led to the
March 2009 overthrow of the then president Ravalomanana and the takeover by
Rajoelina, his main opponent and former Antananarivo mayor who was backed by the
military.

The HAT was put in place afterwards with Ravalomanana forced to flee from the
country. But the new government has not yet been recognized by the international
community, which considered the power transfer as a military coup.

In order to end the political crisis, the four camps led by Rajoelina and former
presidents Ravalomanana, Ratsiraka and Zafy went into negotiations which
culminated in the signing of the Maputo political accord and the Addis Ababa
additional act last year.

They failed to carry out the agreements amid differences over power sharing and
how to organize free and fair elections.

The four camps last month met in Pretoria, South Africa to try and resolve the
issues, but again did not come out with an agreement. The mediator of the
Southern Africa Development Community, former Mozambican president Joaquim
Chissano, does not give up the efforts, saying the next round of negotiations
will be held within 15 days.
