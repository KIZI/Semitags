Well, its a start I suppose...

 NATO warship sinks pirate ship off Somalia 

 
A NATO destroyer has sunk a pirate mothership in the Indian Ocean off the Somali coast after allowing the crew to leave, the alliance said Monday.

HDMS Absalon

By SLOBODAN LEKIC
Associated Press Writer

BRUSSELS Â—A NATO destroyer has sunk a pirate mothership in the Indian Ocean off the Somali coast after allowing the crew to leave, the alliance said Monday.

Shona Lowe, an anti-piracy spokeswoman, said the HDMS Absalon - the Danish flagship of the three-vessel NATO flotilla in the region - disrupted a pirate operation by "scuttling" one of the large boats used by Somali gangs to transport attack teams to piracy hunting areas far off the coast.

The mothership was fired on and sunk after its crew members were transferred to a smaller boat in tow, which was allowed to return to the mainland, she said.

"NATO is not in the business of firing at skiffs with pirates in them," Lowe said in an interview from NATO's naval headquarters in Northwood, near London.
 

I think they will find anti-piracy operations will be much more effective if they sink the pirates while in their ships.
 
 
Hmm. NATO does something pretty constructive.

Whats constructive about it?
 
 
Stupid move. The only way to eliminate piracy is to eliminate pirates.

My apologies MHP

Piracy is a business, increase the cost and you decrease the frequency, increase the violence and innocent people die.

You referring to the pirates themselves?

Or to the possibility of retaliation, by the pirates, upon innocent civilians?

I'm referring to their victims, who could expect rougher treatment if the level of violence is increased.

Piracy won't end because the supply of potential pirates has dried up, it will end because the return on investment drops to the point where no one will put up the money for a mother ship.

How much do pirates cost?

Well, I'm hesitant to disagree with the above statement. Off the top of my head, I can't recall anyone being killed by pirates, unless I'm missing something.

Yup. Or decrease the profit for risk margin.

Not very much.

Not in this context (that I know of).

But pirates ever?  
 
 
Dead pirates have never, to my knowledge, killed anyone, regardless of profit/risk.

Wouldn't that just make ransoms even higher?
 
 
Ahem if this had been a Royal Navy ship, they would have hung these brigands from the yardarm, arrrrr! Where is Meadehall Pirate anyway?
 
 
Lads,

To get a better understanding of Pirates (or Afghanistan) check out Ross Kemp Series on his documentaries... He has award winning documentaries on both confilcits.. He interviews the pirates and gets into what they are about...

By the way his Afghanistan stuff is brilliant... He basically goes on patrols and missions with a British units in helman province... Number of scenes of him taking fire and alot of battle scences (the guy must be a bit daft).. He is very unbiased...

Actually just after doing a two part series on Israel-Palestine conflict, one from the Palestine side and one from the Israel side... Gripping stuff (especially when he goes into one of the tunnels between Gazza and Egypt, bloody dangerous, great reporting)..

Here is the you tube but you could get the torrent download of it as well( I don't know if this would be legal)... By the way the company that paid for these series is SKY which is owned by Murdoch but has no editorial input, think they say if a guy is willing to go into warzone and get shot at by the Taliban then he say what he likes... This is one of the top shows on SKY...

Exactly. Pirates tend to have pretty high opinion of themselves, and won't risk it if they are guaranteed death if caught.

These guys will be back at it tomorrow and pissed because we sank their boat.
 
 
"The mothership was fired on and sunk after its crew members were transferred to a smaller boat in tow, which was allowed to return to the mainland, she said."

okay now i'm confused.

Pirate mothership is cruising along, and HDMS Absalon intercepts it. HDMS Absalon Captain orders crew of pirate mothership to abandon her, and retreat to smaller vessel that she was towing. After the pirates complied, HDMS Absalon sinks pirate mothership, as pirates head back to shore in their smaller vessel.

That, or something very similar to that, is what occurred, as far as I can tell.

yes of course an increase in pain or consequences as in making it less attractive to be a pirate by expunging them violently and demonstrably as they were for centuries before we got all civilized would then make anyone imposing such, guilty of ratcheting up the violence

God thats perfect, I mean it goober, you're the best..perfect Liberal thinking, don't deal with the disease, cure the symptom. Oh, and you get points for the usual peaceful and chic spineless Euro collaboration as that has been their take on it too...........gotta love the consistency.

hang them, hang them out of hand. Shit would blow over...period, they would prey on each other on shore and cut the crap...but hey...I am only for like effective answers...sorry, guess I need to seek absolution.  

 
Piracy won't end because the supply of potential pirates has dried up, it will end because the return on investment drops to the point where no one will put up the money for a mother ship.
 

oh so now its an exercise in economics? Supply & demand, return on investment etc.....you've turned into a republican......

i'm just baffled. even if they didn't want to kill the pirates for whatever ethical reason, why didn't they arrest them all? why would you just let them return to shore? at least take the leader in for questioning or something.

clearly this is obama's fault.

I can't see Uh-bama's hand in any of this, but I agree with you that to just let them go free merely invites them to return with another ship to pirate some more. Poorly thought out, in my view.
 
 
Even I am not convinced that Obama writes NATO's rules of engagement. That doesn't doesn't mean he can't publicly shame them from their shenanigans.

But that I know he won't do.  
 
 
lol, pirate "mothership". Probabily a shrimp trawler with a make-shift electric motor. But I like how epic it sounds anyways.
 
 
If you have the right crew, you can sink the 'mother---ship' with all hands and who's gonna know it wasn't an electrical failure, RPG misfire, or rogue wave? The pirates don't have to know Why their comrades sometimes don't come back to dissuade them from going out themselves...
 
 
Killing them would not have accomplished anything. Arresting them makes things difficult, too, because the question arises of where you will try them and imprison them. Any action sets a precedent that could make things difficult in the long term.

Unfortunately, long-term, big picture thinking seems to be a rarity these days.

It wouldn't have eliminated one batch of pirates and sent a message to others that piracy might not be a healthy career choice?

Indeed.

Unlikely. There aren't a whole lot of options for these people. And, young men aren't known for their strong grip on the concept of their own mortality. Killing these men would have potentially triggered reprisals gainst future hostages. It would have been very unlikely to result in difficulty recruiting.

why not just bring them aboard for questioning, see what you can get out of them, then let them go if you want to?

You think a bunch of guys who are going to storm a giant cargo vessel in order to hold its crew and cargo for ransom in fairly heavily patrolled waters is going to buy a mother ship? No, they first seize a mother ship, which is usually just a fishing boat, and turn it into a mother ship. The only way to stop it is to ruin the countryÂ’s fishing industry. ThatÂ’s what makes this such a thorny problem.
 
 
Congrats to the Danes!

then I suggest a re-reading of history..where active anti Piracy took place piracy disappeared.....thats why they wondered the '7 seas', the piracy in the Med completely disappeared when Jefferson sent Decatur to handle it and those brave euros. only I think Sweden of all folks stepped up to help, the french et al paid them to leave them alone.

I guess that all cool with your idea of not upsetting the apple cart, apparently, because...carrying Goobers idea to its only conclusion we might as well build them a club med or sandals resort and just avoid them even having to have a boat, we'll pay them a stipend on top of it, to sit on their beach as we sail by, forgoing any 'inconvenience' at all, makes sense right?

I mean a gun could go off one day actually hurt someone, we don't want an escalation in violence because well, they will take it out on their hostages, sooooo we'll pay them then, hows that? The whole conflict goes away right?
 
 
Imp raises a good point. Piracy flourished (ie the Caribbean, the Spanish Main, Captain Morgan, as Tann pointed out) because it often had the backing of various governments. Remove that backing, and add in active and forceful anti-piracy campaigns, and we saw piracy crumble.

Look, I'm sorry, but until you actually put that into English, I can't take what you say seriously. That, and your take on history is specious, since piracy still takes place now, and I can't understand what you're saying.

More bullshit. Go ahead and show where, in terms of piracy, I've ever had an 'idea' of not upsetting an apple cart.

Carrying out what I've actually posted, as opposed to your fantasies about the same, don't you ever get tired of looking the fool?

Huh ?  

The coastal Somalis engage in piracy precisely because their local self-sufficient fishing industry has been ruined by heavily subsidized agro-industrial corporations with the help of local corrupt functionaries. Destroying what's left of it would leave the coastal Somalis even less options.

there also wasn't the MASSIVE discrepancy in tech between the pirates and the rest. We've got satallite imaging and US destroyers and cruisers. We've got navy seals. They are 3rd world highwaymen of the sea that are pretty lucky if they can have a functioning.50 cal on their piece of shit boat.

But back in the day, the pirates had smaller, much faster ships, there was no radio or gps, or air support, or snipers rifles or missles etc. just dinky little cannons and muskets. (which will kill you dead enough but aren't nearly as effective as cutting edge tech. which we have and the somali pirates most certainly don't)
If they'd just send a few subs over there and have them perform a few months worth of hunter killer ops on the pirates, i think it would go a long way to taking some of the fight out of them.
 
 
That's well and good until we start slaughtering fishing vessels by mistake.

They're not flying skulls and crossbones.

thats what you got periscopes and the ability to surface and question people before you blow the fuck out of them. Also what youve got a radio for. Just sayin.
Its easy, answer a distress call? follow the little boats filled with guys with aks back to the big boat and torpedo the shit out of it

Not really. If we can dump more nuclear waste off the coast of Somalia we can ruin the fishing industry and the their overpopulation problem at the same time.

And, thus, the problem. The ships with pirates on them aren't advertising themselves with big signs saying "hey, we're pirates!"
 
 
No they're not, but when they show themselves, they should die.

which is what you've got satellite surveillence, on site surveillence (in the form of submarines) and airial surveillence for. you find the ones that board other ships and shoot up the place. boom. dead pirates.

You're talking about literally thousands of square miles (10s of thousands? 100s of thousands?). Is this really worth repurposing most of the Navy and our satellite coverage to deal with?

that would be called a patrol. and we've got ships ALL over the world, whole fleets of them, with enough nukes to turn us all into creepy radioactive zombies 3 times over. the billion dollar operation is already launched. i just want it to be used right there. i'm not talking a land war. I'm talking a small battlegroup consisting of maybe a pair of destroyers, and a sub. thats not alot, and it would go a long way to catching most anything around the somalian coast.

dude idk if you know this or not, but our navy is pretty fucking big. add to that the fact that nothing the pirates have can do much of anything compared to a fully armed battlegroup, say like the one thats touring the east in a goodwill tour at this very moment. My friend is with the marine detachment, he's a lieutenant. They are literally spending billions of dollars to wine and dine the chinese, indonesia etc why not just take that money and that battlegroup and let them hunt pirates?

and we've got plenty of spy satellites and recon planes.
What say ye matey? Avast!
 
 
It's a fun and game until someone drives a LNG carrier into a major port and sets it off.

It's true that our navy is more oriented towards large ships and air forces than lots of small ship spread out, though that's changing.

Of course we can solve that in about 12 hours with a handfull of bombers.

we could solve it in about an hour with one ICBM loaded with a high yield nuke. that doesn't make it a great idea. there has to be some discretion involved, and carpet bombing doesn't have discretion. A small battlegroup wouldn't have too much trouble hunting up and down the coast, and it wouldn't kill everthing it came across, just those caught in the act of piracy.

Dude, I'm not sure if you understand the scale that you're talking about. The Somali coastline is 1880 miles long. They're operating up to 1000 miles offshore. That's 1,880,000 square miles to patrol. If you dispatched the entire US navy to patrol the area, there would still be huge swaths of ocean that would be days of travel from any ship.

This is the third time I've seen you use this argument. While you seem to think it makes you look clever it actually shows you to be simple minded in the extreme. Noone is trying to argue that dead people can do anything, but rather that if you make the penalty for kidnapping death it will result in more dead kidnappees, not less kidnapping.

I keep waiting for you to use it against suicide bombers

It's not just that, there are also thousands of perfectly innocent fishing/commerce and even pleasure boats in the area. It''s like the muggers in a crowded street how do you even tell who the bad guys are?

Not if you just focus on the major shipping lanes.

ah i see. we can't solve 100% of the problem so we shouldn't do anything at all.

Hey gosh i guess we should just let all those rapists and murderers out. I mean after all theres no way we can get them all so we might as well just sit on our hands

You wait for them to mug someone while you observe from concealment. Like i said, air support, sat support, sub support. Hell have the sub shadow some of the fatter targets and wait for them to be boarded etc.

False. there are better ways to deal with the piracy problem, though. I'm against wasting resources on an ineffective strategy.

Extreme, maybe, but I think that it's you who is being simple minded here.
As a hypothetical: Suppose I was the god of USPOL and I decided that I didn't want you posting on my forum any more. Hell, actually, I didn't want any brain dead liberal posting, but I'll start with you because you called me simple minded. How do I stop you from posting? I suppose I could take away your keyboard and send you on your merry way. Your first stop would likely be Comp USA to pick up another board. I guess I could confiscate keyboard after keyboard, but until Comp USA runs out of stock, you'll keep coming back.
If however, I put a round between your eyes, you will stop posting immediately.
Maybe Rhamota and Danny will get the message, maybe they won't. A bullet to Rhamota's brain and another problem is solved. Danny may or may not stop posting. His choice, but I have more bullets than Comp USA has keyboards. Pretty soon, liberals would see that I'm not fucking around and find something else to occupy their time.
Simple, huh?

I'd love to hear your strategy, or is sinking their boat and sending them home all you have?

Well, my strategy would involve a serious commitment over a period of many years. First, we have to help Somalia stabilize and come under a single government. Yeah, that would likely involve military action, though I'd prefer that that part be performed by troops with blue helmets.

Once a government is stabilized, the next step is to help to develop the Somali economy such that these coastal villages can support themselves via legal, nonviolent means, whether farming, fishing or otherwise.

In the meantime, I would increase international patrols of the shipping lanes. I would work with the UN to develop a new directive that makes piracy in international waters a crime that can be tried via an international court, possibly in the hague, with imprisonment distributed reasonably across member nations that can ensure humane treatment of prisoners. This imprisonment would be under the supervision of the Red Cross/Red Crescent.

So your first step is to militarily stabilize the country?

How do you do that without killing pirates, either on land or on shore?

Lads,

There is so much horse manure on this thread it is unbelievable... For starters using a $80k torpedo to blow up a 100 buck fishing boat is not going to solve the problem. The problem does stem from the land as there is no law there. Patroling of the major shipping lanes is already being done and fishing boats are searched continuously...

The problem is that the major shipping lanes are the places a fishing for large communities a vast majority are law abiding citizens just going on with there business weaving between these big ships.. There is no large pirate boat and the whole process of kidnapping these ships involves nothing more than tiny ship boats (more like dingies) and a ladder or pole they shimmy up on the boats usually from the rear. Really have to get the idea of Captain Morgan and a skull and cross roads out of your head...

Fishing boats are on the waters everyday continuously and are boarded for signs of piracy but if the boat was involved in piracy it is nearly impossible to know because before they have a chance to board these small boats all evidence is usually thrown over the side.

If the pirates board the boats it is nearly impossible to get them off as they have hostages and the ransoms are usually not huge in comparison.

Why are there pirates? Simple, Money. A fisherman out there was lucky to make $500 / year. This figure has dropped dramatically due to Nuclear waste dumping and illegeal fishing by mainly European and Asian companies. We let this happen. We didn't protect the Somalian people and the government was unable to help themselves. This forced alot of people into starvation with big expensive merchant boats cruising up and down outside the door.
If 10 men hijack a ship and get $1 million. Even by giving half of it to the local warlord(tax is a bitch in Somalia) they still have $50,000 a piece... they are now living like royality being able to buy proper house, send the kids to school and look after the extended family(stealth tax)... Therefore the risk versus reward is not there... We killed there way of life and the ability to feed themselves and before they starved to death they did the only thing they know to feed there families...

First things first stop nuclear waste dumping and illegal fishing of Somalia....

Lads, Most of this post is based on a brilliant documentary called 'Ross Kemp - In Search of Pirates'... Honestly download it/you tube... He is very good and seems very unbiased... He started this sersis by first meeting the marines and navy who patrol these waters and then meets the pirates himself.... Very interesting, mind nearly all of Ross Kemp's recent documentarys have been great..

Seems that the libs want to make the pirates the protected class.... We just need to encourage hiring practices that get more pirates into government jobs. Wait! There is no government in Somalia. I guess we'll have to move them all to Washington. obama can make them maritime law czars.
