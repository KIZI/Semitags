A woman is in critical condition after a car being chased by Philadelphia police crashed into a crowd and killed three young children, at least one of them hers.

Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey says Wednesday night's crash began with two men stealing a motorcycle at gunpoint. One man fled on the motorcycle, and the other sped away in a car.

Police were pursuing the car when it jumped the curb and hit the crowd in front of a house. All the children killed were under age 10.

Mayor Michael Nutter says the scene was "horrific."

The car's driver was arrested at the scene. The motorcycle rider was arrested at his home. Police say they will release more information Thursday morning.
