Stuff the Steelers! The Seattle wave will wash 'em overboard!
     
 
 
Seahawks by 10.
 
 
People who base their predictions on "Steelers having a better defense" are ingorant of 'facts' which show both teams do about the same job of keeping people out of the endzone.

Oh - and seattle averages more than a field goal MORE Points per game, than does Pitt.  
 
 
Pitt by at least 10. I don't wanna ever see you "Left" coast weenies in Wa. win a Super bowl! :funnyface
 
 
I don't like either team. I think Steelers will win it but I don't want them getting near Dallas' record of 5 SB wins, so I'll be rooting for Seahawks.
 
 
I'm for the Steelers this year.

One of their star running backs (Parker)
is from my alma mater (North Carolina).

Bill, a bar owner buddy of mine, is from Pennsylvania,
and Kelly, my favotite aerobics instructor,
is from Beaver Falls (Joe Namath's home town).

I asked Kelly if she was gonna watch the game
at a Pittsburgh sports bar, dreaming we might
watch it together somewhere.

She said she was going to watch it at home, alone,
no callers.

I hope next time I see her, next week, she gives me
another even better hug 'cause the Steelers won.
 
 
Steelers roll, 38-20.
 
 
I'm rootin for the Seahawks.  
 
 
'Hawks shock them 33 to 21....
 
 
I'd like the steelers to win for Bus and Cowher. But the steeler fans that live around me are obnoxious. Besides that point, im starting to see the the popular pick is the Steelers, but the pro gamblers are putting the money on Seattle. That tells me something.

Im saying Seattle 24 Pitt 23. Its definitely not going to be a blowout.
 
 
I say Steelers, probably by at least 10. I have no knowledge of the two teams, though. I'm basing this purely on Glenn Beck's "Moron Trivia," which correctly predicts 3/4 of all NFL games.
