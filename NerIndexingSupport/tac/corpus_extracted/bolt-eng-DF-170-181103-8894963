Former White House adviser Van Jones says that progressives are going to launch an "October offensive" to rival the Tea Party, in the spirit of the Arab Spring protests across the Middle East.

"Everybody should hold onto their seats. October is going to be the turning point when it comes to the progressive fight back. You can see it coming," Jones said this week on MSNBC's "The Last Word" with Lawrence O'Donnell.

"You are going to see an American Fall, an American Autumn, just like we saw the Arab Spring," Jones continued. "You can see it right now with these young people on Wall Street. Hold onto your hats, we're going to have an October offensive to take back the American dream and to rescue America's middle class."

What are they going to call it, the Leach Party?

I thought the TEA Party was already dead. Why does anyone need to counter it?

ABC News’ Olivia Katrandjian reports:

The Occupy Wall Street movement, growing to more than 1,500 people in its second week, called for a march in lower Manhattan today at 3 p.m. to “show that it is time that the 99% are heard.”

“We are unions, students, teachers, veterans, first responders, families, the unemployed and underemployed. We are all races, sexes and creeds. We are the majority. We are the 99 percent. And we will no longer be silent,” read a post on the Occupy Wall Street website.

Wow, they must want to be really, really certain obama isn't reelected.
 
 
Again?

First they tried the 'Coffee Party'.... Epic Fail.

Then they tried the 'citizen journalists' (via the HuffPuff).... Epic Fail.

So now they're trying an 'October Offensive'.... Who gives a fuck? Bring it on. This country is, by nature, center right. Live with it, Lefties. Your constant fails are fun.

Funny how when it's a Democrat in the WH, Congress has 'tied his hands', but when it was Bush, he alone was responsible.   That shows an interesting 'thought process'... in that it clearly shows an absolute lack of any thought whatsoever.

Must be hard to be that dumb.

If that is still true, then maybe that's the problem.

Not true. We are all Americans, but some of us want to live according to the Constitution and you, clearly, do not. Since those who want to live by that document outnumber those who want to trash it, we win. You lose. Simple math.

Van Jones is a communist. I suggest he, and anyone who agrees with him, move to China.

<Yawn>

They have tried this before and failed epically.

You have to pay union people to show and bus them in to boot. Somehow its hard to imagine their hearts are really in it. Offensive? That sounds military and violent. Reminds me of targeting. So, you are all good with this? Hypocrite.

Van Jones is a "former" communist.

 

By the time he took the job in the White House, Jones was becoming accustomed to working within the system, and was admired by members of both parties. But before that, he was a radical activist, an admitted angry Communist who took the kind of positions not normally embraced in the mainstream. In one speech he gave this year, he called Republicans assholes  he called himself one, too, but thats not really what the right cared about. And, conservative bloggers discovered, hed signed on to a petition promoted by 9/11 Truthers.

At least it was recognizable as a free country where people could choose whether or not to purchase services from corporate entities.

Obama's lack of leadership and experience have screwed up the economy beyond all recognition and things won't be getting better as long as he resides at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. No matter how much you scream that things are getting better. Getting better my ass!

Former? only if you agree he moved on to Fascist. Otherwise if he's a former communist, my ass can chew bubblegum.
 
 
Van Jones is more socialist than communist.
 
 
Take note folks, Van Jones is a person the Obama appointed to his administration.

This is the TYPE of people he runs around with and has always ran around with..

nice job you people who voted to bring the Obama on us.
 
 
 
Again?

First they tried the 'Coffee Party'.... Epic Fail.

Oh ok, might as well just get rid of the opposing side entirely then, right?

sometimes i feel like i am reading the crucible rather than usmb.
 
 
 
Beck would have been on solid ground if he said Jones used to be a communist. Jones has been up front about that.

But Beck has repeatedly said Jones is a communist. Present tense. Although we could not find a comment in which Jones explicitly said why he is no longer one, we found ample evidence that he now believes capitalism is the best force for the social change he is seeking. So there's truth to Beck's claim in that Jones was a communist, but it's apparent he isn't any longer, as Beck suggests. So we find the claim Barely True.

If you're referring to the carbine that was held by the black man, I hope you are correct too, only difference being is that 1) the left dont know how to use guns and they are pussies.
2) Even the ones that do know how will end up shooting themselves or an innocent bystander which will lead to more outcry by the left for gun control, and the dumbass who did it will be painted a tea party member that just happened to be there or something stupid like that because that message fits in with the lefts propoganda.

You really are blind aren't you? Heres an example of how the left are ins so much harmony and peaceful. I bet the dude thought he could go in "Because he is a black leftist" and trick someone into hitting him, and it didn't work out so he got violent himself.

More left wing lunicy, even our own president advocates violence. You're an idiot if you actually believe half the things you say. Make sure you pay attention at 3:40 of the last video, Loughner was a devote leftist, but yet the left blamed the right for it!!! HAHA!!!

It's so nice to see protest signs spelled correctly.

 

That's because curse words are the only words within the violent scope of the leftist brains that they know how to spell correctly.
 
 
Was that Herman Cain in that first video?
 
 
 
 
 
Yes, everything was sooo perfect when he took office...

 

And instead of passing policies that made things better he doubled down on the ones that ended up making things worse. You can only blame Bush for so long, it's been 3 years, and after 2 years Bammie has to take credit now.

 

How long did it take to recover from the Great Depression? Also, was Obama just supposed to walk away from Bush's TWO wars? At least Obama is whacking the evildoers.

 

Obama promised to get us out of Iraq and Afghanistan, and then he realized he could further depreciate the value of the dollar even faster by pumping even more money into both wars....and also a 3rd war that was not authorized by congress. How many campaign promises has he broke so far?
And that's besides the point, the man has spent almost 4 trillion dollars in 3 years on programs that failed,political kick backs and corrupt back room deals to allies at the tax payers expense, that's more then the last 3 presidents have spent combined in 20 years. Do you not find that a little odd and does that not piss you off just a wee little bit? To have so much money thrown away at the expense of the country that you wish to save?
 
 
 
You almost gotta laugh. The communist former leader of an arson and looting rampage says he is organizing an "october offensive" and the mind numbed robots on the left think it's good news.

 

Obama might have promised him immunity if he starts a race war, just like the Obama DOJ gave the New black panther party immunity for the voter intimidation during the 2008 elections in Philadelphia.

Good Luck, I love the Idea of More Points of View being out there.

Good Luck rivaling the Popularity of the Basic Tea Party Ideas though. Twice as many Americans consider themselves Conservative then Liberal. Already, Despite the Smear Campaign about 3% more Americans say they agree with the Tea Party, as the Number of Americans that Self Identify as Liberal.

You can Marginalize us/them all you want, but Fiscal Conservatives, and Limited Government types like myself are not going anywhere. The More you Liberals build the Debt, and Ignore our Problems with Entitlement, and Expand Government, the More Popular our Message becomes.

"Moyer-Sims, of Portland, Ore., said the group has grown much more organized. "We have a protocol for most things," she said, including getting legal help for people who are arrested."

The levels of ineptitude on display with the protestors is astounding. What can be surmised from this objective is showing up for some type of confrontation with authority. Other than that, they're clueless.

You know... if the Tea Party and the loony left armed up and went at each other, my money's on the tea party. It's much more likely they're better shots.

Of course, the loony left would be better at bombing innocent civilians and symbolic targets like they did in the 1960's as well as committing arson. Yes sir. My money's on them for that.
 
 
 
 
 
Wow, they must want to be really, really certain obama isn't reelected.

 

Congress has Obama's hands tied, so he may even have a hand in this...

 

Funny how when it's a Democrat in the WH, Congress has 'tied his hands', but when it was Bush, he alone was responsible.   That shows an interesting 'thought process'... in that it clearly shows an absolute lack of any thought whatsoever.

Must be hard to be that dumb.

 

well no, it was more like, Bush had him and congress and was able to do basically what he wanted. between 00 and 06.

he also had a week Democrat party that bent over at every turn..

But keep trying.

The Occupy Wall Street movement, growing to more than 1,500 people in its second week, called for a march in lower Manhattan today at 3 p.m. to show that it is time that the 99% are heard.

We are unions, students, teachers, veterans, first responders, families, the unemployed and underemployed. We are all races, sexes and creeds. We are the majority. We are the 99 percent. And we will no longer be silent, read a post on the Occupy Wall Street website.

Attacks on family members will not be tolerated and will be subject to action by an Admin/Mod. Action taken could range from a warning to banning and will be at Admin/Mod discretion. The only exception to this is IF a member brings his/her family member(s) into the conversation first.

Movement Liberalism died when the Left rebelled against LBJ and Vietnam. It died when they lost their hero McGovern, only to suffer through a couple of weak Southern centrists in Carter and Clinton (both of whom sold Labor down river). The Left dropped out of politics, and balkanized into a million disparate parts, from peace-&-love hippies to alternative energy, feminism, and Yoga cults.

Indeed, SDS disbanded just as the Young Republicans started to build a tightly organized national movement - spreading their chapters to every major university. The Left now has nothing at the university level to pull students into a cohesive political force (like the college Republicans, who were lead by men like Grover Norquist & Jak Abermoff, both of whom created vast networks for moving business profits into political outcomes). Remember: the Left glamorized the act of "dropping out" and rebelling against their straight-laced 50s parents. The Left glamorized its war against authority and political power in favor of hippie-dippie Kerouac free-love blah, blah. Now they are paying a terrible price for not having a powerful national movement. The best they can do is have a few disorganized sit-ins and protests - maybe throw a few rocks at bankers - but they lack national organization. They don't have the corporate funding channeled through outfits like "Freedom Works" which busses Tea Party members to Town Hall meetings. The Left has nobody to blame but themselves.

If you spend 30 years smoking dope and preaching about how power corrupts... than don't be surprised if you have no power. Duh!?!

When people talk about a Leftist movement, they are being naive. The Left is 30 years behind the Republicans, who have an empire of think tanks and media holdings - with the best funding source available: business (which wants lower taxes and austerity for the serfs). Do you really think Greenpeace can deliver more electoral funding than Exxon or Eli Lilly? People who say the media is filled with Left sympathizers are merely repeating GOP garbage. Everyone knows that the mega-corporations who own Big Media want lower taxes, less regulations, and zero unions.

The Left gave-up on power many years ago. They made fun of people who "joined the system". Now they are paying a terrible price because movement conservatism and big business run the country. The only thing the Left is good at now is organizing a drum circle.

 Occupy Wall Street: Celebrities Show Support 

 

you don't get us at all do you?

We bring millions. That's why 2010 was so bad for you.

If push comes to shove, watch what will happen.

Wolverines will be the cry.
 
 
As a matter of fact progressive "celebrities" are the biggest fucking hypocrites when it comes to politics.

A bunch of rich do-good nothings that wouldn't buy a box of boyscout cookies but would buy a $35,000 dinner from Obama who won't be attending.

Fucking losers....

I know phonetic youphanisms (euphemisms).....

Considering progressives are such Noam Chomsky fans - I'd figure you would understand this.

Either that or you believe those who oppose you are idiots - when in fact they're generally way more intelligent than you are.
 
 
 
Are there any teabagger celebrities? I don't recall ever seeing any. Although I don't consider him a celebrity, I've seen Ted "Draft Dodger" Nugent supporting teabaggers.

 

Gary Sinise for starters.

And as far as Teddly goes don't get me worked up before I can even get dewey on him.

You don't consider him a celebrity? Who are you? Who the hell are you? The Nuge isn't big enough for the high and mighty God Lakhota poster?

What have you done in your life? Where are all your awards? Truly, what have you done to deem Nugent not worthy of consideration?

By all means justify your existence on the planet compared to the talent I know as Ted.

What and who are you? And back it up.

Why does it matter?

Since when does being famous make you an knowledgeable person on politics or anything else for that matter?

Their job is to "entertain" us - much like our currant president and congress.

Now show pictures of the camps....

Show that billy badass pic of that progressive whore doing yoga with her hippies. Yea, she had a badass ass (politics aside).

Anyways - politics included - you're a dishonest fool, that is only showing one side the 5% that are not hippie fools, or even people looking and stopping out of curiosity.
 
 
 

Wow, there must be millions...
 
 
 
Where's the Occupy Wall Street for Jesus lady...?

 

 

At least the lady can spell simple words we learn in the 1st grade.

 

I bet learning the word "Island" would melt their brains....

The funny part is that they're not even phonetically correct..

WTF...

It only proves democrats HIRE people who cant spell for shit, probably illegal aliens to make signs in which democrat idiots never noticed...

The idiots in the picture are too goddamn stupid to have a draem.

They're being paid to hold those stupid illiterate signs...

Obviously they have been paid to hold those signs and have absolutely no idea what the fuck is going on or they never attended kindergarten.

I wonder if those sign makers argued over the correct spelling of the word...

If so I would kill to see that one..... hahahaha...

October 2011

October 2011 is the 10th anniversary of the invasion of Afghanistan and the beginning of the 2012 federal austerity budget. It is time to light the spark that sets off a true democratic, nonviolent transition to a world in which people are freed to create just and sustainable solutions.

Starting on October 6, 2011, thousands of concerned Americans will assemble in Freedom Plaza, in Washington DC to take control of our country and our lives. We will occupy the plaza and hold a People's Assembly where we come up with just and sustainable solutions to the crises we face and demand that these solutions be presented and that the people's needs be addressed. We will plan and engage in creative acts of civil resistance and demand that our inherent rights and freedoms be protected, and that our children have a chance to live in peace,to breathe clean air, and to grow edible natural food.

Will you stand with us and denounce the systems and institutions that support endless war and unrestrained corporate greed?

I would warn against doing what they do because I would recommend individuals throwing people around.

Yes, violence against opposition is the only way! Crush their dreams mein Führer!
 
 
 
 
I bet none of the Occupy Wall Street protesters ever bombed an abortion clinic. They are not violent people.

 

No just police stations and ironically college universities.

Wait until they start smashing storefronts an steal shit - you'll have a fun time defending them then.

Yeah that's what the cavemen do when society tells their message to fuck off...

It's only a matter of time - tick, tick tick...

Oh and don't be shocked if the tea party gets involved if you riot...

"please police the man is beating me for stealing a free TV from a smashed store window - brutality - someone help me, brutality - it's mine."

Fucking dirty pieces of shit.....

 

You don't see how ridiculous you look here?

There's been no "violence". There's been no "riots".

You're raging against some fantasy in your own head. You don't know who the people there are - I'm sure there are plenty of trust-fund kids and "Socialists", but they're not the only ones there. Just like there are some people at "Tea Parties" that you guys are probably pretty ashamed of as well.

Reality doesn't fit your "all conservatives are hard-working, America-loving good ol' boys and all liberals are on the verge of rioting like the animals they are" nonsense.

I suppose property rights go out the window today...

Strong man..........
 
 
 
Again?

First they tried the 'Coffee Party'.... Epic Fail.

Then they tried the 'citizen journalists' (via the HuffPuff).... Epic Fail.

So now they're trying an 'October Offensive'.... Who gives a fuck? Bring it on. This country is, by nature, center right. Live with it, Lefties. Your constant fails are fun.

 

And everyone can clearly see who's REALLY destroying America.

... Oh, except for Lakhota, who has his head too far up Obama's ass to see anything very clearly. Maybe he can get his Messiah to put a peephole in his belly button.
 
 
 
 
It's not a problem for us. If you don't like it be sure not to come here.

 

I'm sure it isn't a problem for you. You stole the land and used slave labor to build.

 

Yeah, we're the only country in the history of the world that had conquest and slavery.

Can you pussyache a little more, Princess?

Oh ok, might as well just get rid of the opposing side entirely then, right?

Heil!

 

Why? Watching you mouthbreathers step on your johnsons every couple of days is so much fun.
 
 
 
 
"The resistance".....lol!!! They don't even know what they're protesting. They're so pitiful it's laughable.

 

Oh, I don't know. I think this guy has a thoughtful and eloquent view:

 

 

At least it's lettered neatly.
 
 
 
 
 
Yes, everything was sooo perfect when he took office...

 

And instead of passing policies that made things better he doubled down on the ones that ended up making things worse. You can only blame Bush for so long, it's been 3 years, and after 2 years Bammie has to take credit now.

 

How long did it take to recover from the Great Depression? Also, was Obama just supposed to walk away from Bush's TWO wars? At least Obama is whacking the evildoers.

 

A lot longer than it had to, since the nation was stuck with a dumbass, big-government liberal who wanted to spend money like it was water.

Sounds familiar.
 
 
What ever happen to liberals version of the tea party the coffee party? OH thats right it was an utter failure.
 
 
 
 
Jones is nothing more than a professed communist that would love to see our society replaced by socialism. And idiots think he is doing the right thing, IDIOTS!!!!!

 

Van Jones is a "former" communist.

 

Yea, he conveniently 'converted' when power called. If you believe that, I got some land in Florida you're gonna love.

He is a self proclaimed 'radical communist'. He's yours. We don't want him. We do not do communism in the US. It goes against our Constitution. Only the weak follow communists... and, historically, it hasn't worked out to well for them.

  Yea, sure you did.
 
 
The left is free to do and think whatever they like, unlike the ideologues on the right, who all fall in line behind whatever corporate and conservative think tank and media are telling them to repeat. Note how many apologies the republican presidential candidates give every time they have an individual thought or engage a talking point that is sacrosanct. Freedom for the right is slogan, marching in line behind the ideological lines is their only refuge. The question on taxes at the debate exemplifies the right's lack of free thought. And their booing a gay soldier nailed them. Of course the left suffers politically because of their inclusion of all people and all ideas, but that at least is more American and democratic than the lemmings on the right.

The shooting of Giffords has nothing to do with the right. The only ones who claim otherwise are the moronic left. That's no big claim to logic. It does not take the brain of a rocket scientist to see that.

Tell that to your moronic borg. The ones who parrot the left wing talking points provided to them by the left wing media.

It is laughable to claim one side is any better than the other when it comes to parroting bullshit.... But you would need to use some critical thinking to see that.

Former White House adviser Van Jones says that progressives are going to launch an "October offensive" to rival the Tea Party, in the spirit of the Arab Spring protests across the Middle East.

 

 

Yes, because nothing wins over votes than a bunch of radical blood in their eye nutbags threatening to burn things down...

The thing I have always criticized the Union movement for is that they expect the government to do their jobs for them.

When I was a kid, I grew up in a Union household. We didn't need the government. When an employer had a strike called against it, you didn't do business with it. You bought products that said "Made in the USA".

Today we whine why the government doesn't do more when we take our fat asses to WalMart and buy cheap made in China crap that falls apart in a week.
 
 
 
Yeah, it okay when moronic teabaggers protest - but it's un-American when the left does it. Right?

I've yet to see any of the Wall Street protestors packing weapons or stomping heads.

 

It's patriotic dissent when a Republican is in the White House -- but it's treason when there's a Democrat in the White House. Right?

Shhhhh, that's the resistance. Take away the profanities and you have....is, and, up.

 

   
 
 
 
 
 
They are barely getting any recognition.

Maybe they need to take over some university campuses and set fire to some admin buildings.

 

Exactly, and I'd like to see some "moran" signs and weapons like the teabaggers.

 

If you're referring to the carbine that was held by the black man...

 

Oh, the black man video of whom that MSDNC edited to so they could talk about scary white TEA Party racists with guns?  
 
 
 
It's so nice to see protest signs spelled correctly.

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Van Jones is a great American patriot. I'm sure you prefer Ayn Rand types.

 

Van Jones is a patriot, but not for the United States. He's a patriot for the USSR.

 

I think he would be leaning more closer to China right now than the USSR, but you never know, he maybe hauling for both of them for all we know.

 

Either one. He certainly hates the way America is set up now.
 
 
 
 
They really believe they are accomplishing something I guess..

What a pathetic bunch, mostly college kids...I hope they look back someday when they have a job on Wall street and see how stupid they were.    

 

Yeah, just like those misguided kids at Kent State. Oh wait - they're dead.

 

They're dead because leftists got violent.

I can guarantee you that everything you believe about Kent State is a lie.

No one is asking you to, America was founded on diversity and tolerance of all ideas, an open idea you can call it core if you like but it doesn't fit your ideology. And do you think Enron, Arthur Anderson, and all the corruption that lead to the near collapse of the economy in 2008 under a republican was just wonderful? Seems you are so brainwashed you fail to see reality. Protest is American, whining about freedom and justice for all is right wing conservative republican.

No one is asking you to, America was founded on diversity and tolerance of all ideas, an open idea you can call it core if you like but it doesn't fit your ideology. And do you think Enron, Arthur Anderson, and all the corruption that lead to the near collapse of the economy in 2008 under a republican was just wonderful? Seems you are so brainwashed you fail to see reality. Protest is American, whining about freedom and justice for all is right wing conservative republican.

 

Protest is AMERICAN, except when it is the Tea party, eh?
wow, so wanting FREEDOM AND JUSTICE for all is now called, whining? And that freedom and justice FOR ALL is not having THE GOVERMENT impose IT on the people. It is going out there where you HAVE to Freedom to MAKE YOUR OWN LIFE. If you don't succeed at it that IS YOUR FAULT, no one ELSES.
 
 
 
 
 
The left is free to do and think whatever they like, unlike the ideologues on the right, who all fall in line behind whatever corporate and conservative think tank and media are telling them to repeat. Note how many apologies the republican presidential candidates give every time they have an individual thought or engage a talking point that is sacrosanct. Freedom for the right is slogan, marching in line behind the ideological lines is their only refuge. The question on taxes at the debate exemplifies the right's lack of free thought. And their booing a gay soldier nailed them. Of course the left suffers politically because of their inclusion of all people and all ideas, but that at least is more American and democratic than the lemmings on the right.

Former White House adviser Van Jones says that progressives are going to launch an "October offensive" to rival the Tea Party, in the spirit of the Arab Spring protests across the Middle East.

"Everybody should hold onto their seats. October is going to be the turning point when it comes to the progressive fight back. You can see it coming," Jones said this week on MSNBC's "The Last Word" with Lawrence O'Donnell.

"You are going to see an American Fall, an American Autumn, just like we saw the Arab Spring," Jones continued. "You can see it right now with these young people on Wall Street. Hold onto your hats, we're going to have an October offensive to take back the American dream and to rescue America's middle class."

yea some people say Rush is a great American.....funny how easy it is to put a label on someone.....
 
 
This will end badly for Liberals as it always does.

If they "win" and topple Wall Street and America, just like in every other successful Progressive Jihad (China, USSR, Cambodia, Hitler's Germany, Cuba) the new leaders will round up the protesters and make them disappear because they betrayed they country and were easily manipulated into doing so, you can't have people that stupid breathing the same air as the new rulers.

When they "lose" in the 2012 Landslide they will have successfully pulled the Dem Party down on the ash heap of history be exposing the true Neo-Marxist face of the Dem Party.

It's a Lose-Lose for USMB Progressive and why I will do my part and volunteer at a Suicide Prevention hotline after the November Landslide.

When you are preaching the destruction of the foundations of this nation and replacing it with.... what? bullshit you're defending yourself. You're attacking the innocent.

Greed is not a crime. And the greediest people I see are the people at those protests. They want the money of others without merit or work. That's fucking greed. Ill gotten gain. Why not have a protest "Muggers Against Wage Earners". That's essentially what they're doing. A am reminded of a bit from Die Hard 3 delivered so well by Jeremy Irons:

"Simple Simon met a pie man
going to the fair
Said Simple Simon to the pie man
give me your pies...

... or I'll cave your head in."

That's all I see with these chanting zombies. When they chant every silly thing that drips out of drips mouths like Cornell West, Roseanne Barr and Michael Moore... they're just the Zombiepocalypse.

ROFLMAO. You are so fucking stupid I'm astounded to the depths you'll dip to.

The russian revolution, started by communists. Millions killed.
The Chinese "Cultural Revolution" started by Communists. Over 50 million killed.
The Killing Fields of Cambodia started by Communists. Millions killed.
The Third Reich in Germany, started by the National Socialists. over 60 million killed world wide
The Vietnam War
The Korean War
El Salvador
Nicaragua
Venezuela

All of these revolutions were started by communist agitators and costs the lives of millions. They only were stopped by the death of the people at the helm of the communist movements to spread their totalitarian control over fellow men because of envy and greed.

All I said is that they refuse to stop save for death because they are insane. I did not once say they must be killed. To say otherwise is a fucking lie, and everyone knows it save you.

You don't get people to like you by attacking them or demeaning their success. You know, I grew up in a family of 10 kids, first one to go to college, and I've earned my success. I've earned my right to fly private if I choose to do so.

"And by attacking me it is not going to convince me that I should take a bigger hit because I happen to be wealthy. You know, it is the old -- I think Ted and Fred and I we both sort of take the old Ethel Merman approach to life. I've tried poor and I tried rich and I like rich better. It doesn't mean that I am a bad guy.

"I didn't go in to business to create a public policy success for either party, Republican or Democrat. I went in business to create jobs and opportunity, create opportunity, create value for myself and my investors. And that's what the president should be praising, not demagoguing us simply because Warren Buffet says he pays more than his secretary. He should pay the secretary more and she will pay more."

I just watched "An American Carol". The one scene that kept me chuckling was the "Columbia Peace Studies Lecture" scene where the professors brainwashing the kids there start into a Hair-esque musical about how awesome the 60's were. These gray haired ex hippies now tenured professors because they couldn't survive in the real world dancing and singing about how awesome they were as kids was funny and pathetic.

But that's pretty much what's going on too. The boomers, particularly former radicals, desperate to hold onto their youth and relevance are getting crazier as time goes on, and till age finally ends them, we're going to have to suffer them.
 
 
 
Why aren't they protesting government greed?

 

Apparently, there's no greed involved when you want to take other people's money to redistribute. There's only greed when you want to keep your own money that you've earned.

It's funny how, when you get past the specific, propagandized phrasing of poll questions to a detailed discussion of the real issues, people who thought they supported the more liberal side find out that they didn't really.
 
 
And then all the Commies can come out the closet...
 
 
 
 
It's about damn time the middle class stood up to the bullies!

 

got news for ya, those fuckers out in the streets aren't middle class,, they are basement dwellers. lasy fucking basement dwellers.

 

'Cause if they were middle-class, they wouldn't have TIME to camp out for weeks on Wall Street. They'd have fucking JOBS to go to.

The fact that Mommy and Daddy back home, paying the bills for these twits, are middle-class isn't exactly the same thing.
 
 
 
 
 
Van Jones is a communist. I suggest he, and anyone who agrees with him, move to China.

 

Van Jones is a great American patriot. I'm sure you prefer Ayn Rand types.

 

Van Jones is a hater. An instigator. An agitator. An inflamer. One who incites violence like he's doing now. Are you working for him and his ilk? I imagine there will be more of you joining boards like this over the coming days and months.

 

I agree wholeheartedly!!!
 
 
 
I'd say those polls reflect less of an overall political positioning than they do the success of media-driven propaganda.

 

And I would say that's an excuse, and a blame-tossing explanation of why people believe as they do, which in no way changes the fact that they do.

 
It's funny how, when you get past the specific, propagandized phrasing of poll questions to a detailed discussion of the real issues, people who thought they supported the more liberal side find out that they didn't really.

 

That would be funny, if it were true. Do you have any evidence that it is?
 
 
 
Someone said above that self-professed conservatives outnumber self-professed liberals two to one, or some such. However, going by issue polls, liberals outnumber self-professed liberals by more than two to one. That is, many people who don't call themselves liberals really are.

This country isn't center-right. On most issues, it's center left:

 For First Time, Majority of Americans Favor Legal Gay Marriage 

 Polls: More support for unions in Wisconsin labor battle  CNN Political Ticker - CNN.com Blogs 

 Polls show most Americans support raising taxes on wealthy - Political Hotsheet - CBS News 

 In U.S., Majority Still Wants Less Corporate Influence 

The views of those involved in these left-wing protests (the Wisconsin uprising, Occupy Wall Street, and now this) are supported by a majority of the people, according to polls, while those supporting the positions of the Tea Party are no more than 25% of the people.

It's not possible to change capitalism as it's currently practiced without eradicating it altogether? Is that what you believe?

Thats the funny part...

allegedly their economic plan resembles Stalinism - they claim they're not communists yet they want the government to dictate economy - putting unions at the front of the line. They want wealth redistributed by the government - yet they're not communists.

Of course they will all insist they're not communists - yet they look to the GOVERNMENT for answers...

It really shows how ignorant they are..

Wait Wait,,, don't jump the gun.. Dragon is gonna tell us how they intend to CHANGE capitalism.. I'm making the popcorn,, run get some cold beer. We'll have a beer summit.

I could give you my own ideas, and have done so elsewhere in this forum, but you're asking about the leftist insurgency generally rather than me, so I'll refer you to begin with to the Declaration of the Occupation of New York City. Think of this as a list of grievances similar to those in the Declaration of Independence (on which it may have been patterned):

 Declaration of the Occupation of New York City | NYC General Assembly 

"They have taken our houses through an illegal foreclosure process, despite not having the original mortgage.
They have taken bailouts from taxpayers with impunity, and continue to give Executives exorbitant bonuses.
They have perpetuated inequality and discrimination in the workplace based on age, the color of ones skin, sex, gender identity and sexual orientation.
They have poisoned the food supply through negligence, and undermined the farming system through monopolization.
They have profited off of the torture, confinement, and cruel treatment of countless animals, and actively hide these practices.
They have continuously sought to strip employees of the right to negotiate for better pay and safer working conditions.
They have held students hostage with tens of thousands of dollars of debt on education, which is itself a human right.
They have consistently outsourced labor and used that outsourcing as leverage to cut workers healthcare and pay.
They have influenced the courts to achieve the same rights as people, with none of the culpability or responsibility.
They have spent millions of dollars on legal teams that look for ways to get them out of contracts in regards to health insurance.
They have sold our privacy as a commodity.
They have used the military and police force to prevent freedom of the press. They have deliberately declined to recall faulty products endangering lives in pursuit of profit.
They determine economic policy, despite the catastrophic failures their policies have produced and continue to produce.
They have donated large sums of money to politicians, who are responsible for regulating them.
They continue to block alternate forms of energy to keep us dependent on oil.
They continue to block generic forms of medicine that could save peoples lives or provide relief in order to protect investments that have already turned a substantial profit.
They have purposely covered up oil spills, accidents, faulty bookkeeping, and inactive ingredients in pursuit of profit.
They purposefully keep people misinformed and fearful through their control of the media.
They have accepted private contracts to murder prisoners even when presented with serious doubts about their guilt.
They have perpetuated colonialism at home and abroad. They have participated in the torture and murder of innocent civilians overseas.
They continue to create weapons of mass destruction in order to receive government contracts."

Do otherwise than all of the above, for starters.

I can get more economics-technical for you if you like, but there's no evidence I can see from any of your posts that you would understand it, so for the moment I'll let this speak for itself.

Well, government intervention is one of the biggest problems with capitalism. Capitalism would be a great economic model but democrats believe in DICTATED economies and like other economies, such as socialism (with progressives adore) they try to dictate capitalism. Hence Keynesian economics....

When progressives attempt to dictate an economy they call it a "mixed economy." This economy is not "mixed" capitalism is dictated here in the US...

I want a true capitalist model - that's not dictated by a government...

Their method of dictation is in the form of "regulations" - for the progressives that will ask "how does the government dictate the economy?"

WHO is THEY?

 

and

Why should unions be allowed to give money to politicians but THEY should not??? freedom for thee? but none for Me??? is that it?
 
 
"They" is corporate America, of course, the ruling class.

And

If corporations could not give money to politicians, there would be no need for unions to do so.

EDIT: Of course, I don't expect most right-wingers to agree with most of the above. The point is that most Americans do, including, as it turns out, many of the original Tea Party members (who might disagree about some of the fine points, but emphatically agree that corporate influence on government is far too great). This is a movement that is not going away, and it is going to influence things very strongly over the course of the next few election cycles. The boat is only beginning to rock.

So a more humane economic model involves culls and purges when the economic model can no longer sustain a populace??

You know. Kill millions or let them starve when there is not enough food to feed everyone because there was a bad crop season or because you have created no incentive to progress because everyone is "equal."
 
 
 
"They" is corporate America, of course, the ruling class.

And

If corporations could not give money to politicians, there would be no need for unions to do so.

 

So what will you replace corporate America with?

and

do you favor politicians receiving no money from anyone anytime anywhere?

Go smoke another fatty....
 
 
And, who is they ?
 
 
 
The two factions of right and left have grown so far apart that there is no point on which compromise could be reached. There is only one place this can go.

 

That place where Van Jones is hoping it will go. Obama may have tried to unite Americans and he failed miserably. So now he goes the route of class warfare, pitting American against American and Van Jones is leading the way.

This post is my own personal opinion.

No, unions only exist from laymen greed.

They're unwilling to learn a skill and since there is an abundance of laymen idiot workers supply and demand is not on their side and "organizers" figured out a way to get rich by forming unions and coercing business holding production over their heads if they don't pay a ransom for labor...

It's funny how there is no "accountant union" they don't need a union because they're not idiots - they have a skill..

Is there a civil engineering union? NOPE - they have a skill.

Get the point?

Unions exist because there was a time when labor was exploited by management and workers needed the protections that union membership provided.

Unfortunately over the past fifty years, unions have morphed into organizations that exploit both labor and business to the benefit of union leaders not the workers.

exactly, the union bosses are rich, their workers are unemployed. they still have to pay their dues though employed or not. The unions have priced American jobs overseas and offshore. They have no one to blame but themselves and they try to throw a smoke screen up by blaming the evil rich, wall street and corporations and the unemployed union dupes keep on drinking their kool aid. and NOT answering pertinent questions.
 
 
 
So what will you replace corporate America with?

 

Like those straw men, don't you?

 
do you favor politicians receiving no money from anyone anytime anywhere?

 

I'm in favor of public financing of campaigns such as most democracies today use. I also have no problem with small donations from private individuals. The point is to break the veto power that corporate interests have over public policy.

Correct. And as that is still the case, unions are still needed. Unfortunately, they exist to a much lesser degree than was once the case. As a result, real wages have declined over the past thirty years even as productivity and corporate profits have soared.

liberal ansswer to I got no answer.. drag out the strawman. why can't you answer?
 
 
 
 
I'd say those polls reflect less of an overall political positioning than they do the success of media-driven propaganda.

 

And I would say that's an excuse, and a blame-tossing explanation of why people believe as they do, which in no way changes the fact that they do.

 
It's funny how, when you get past the specific, propagandized phrasing of poll questions to a detailed discussion of the real issues, people who thought they supported the more liberal side find out that they didn't really.

 

That would be funny, if it were true. Do you have any evidence that it is?

 

Only experience, and the evidence of polls which changed the wording on the exact same issue questions, and got different responses.

And I'm quite sure you think it's "just an excuse", because you hate the whole idea that the left's intensive media campaign hasn't succeeded in truly changing people in a fundamental way.
 
 
 
 
then what's yer point?

 

It's not possible to change capitalism as it's currently practiced without eradicating it altogether? Is that what you believe?

 

Capitalism is capitalism. If you change it, it's not capitalism any more. So what are you proposing to change it to?

Okay, How are you going to CHANGE capitalism? what's yer plan?

 

I could give you my own ideas, and have done so elsewhere in this forum, but you're asking about the leftist insurgency generally rather than me, so I'll refer you to begin with to the Declaration of the Occupation of New York City. Think of this as a list of grievances similar to those in the Declaration of Independence (on which it may have been patterned):

 Declaration of the Occupation of New York City | NYC General Assembly 

"They have taken our houses through an illegal foreclosure process, despite not having the original mortgage.
They have taken bailouts from taxpayers with impunity, and continue to give Executives exorbitant bonuses.
They have perpetuated inequality and discrimination in the workplace based on age, the color of ones skin, sex, gender identity and sexual orientation.
They have poisoned the food supply through negligence, and undermined the farming system through monopolization.
They have profited off of the torture, confinement, and cruel treatment of countless animals, and actively hide these practices.
They have continuously sought to strip employees of the right to negotiate for better pay and safer working conditions.
They have held students hostage with tens of thousands of dollars of debt on education, which is itself a human right.
They have consistently outsourced labor and used that outsourcing as leverage to cut workers healthcare and pay.
They have influenced the courts to achieve the same rights as people, with none of the culpability or responsibility.
They have spent millions of dollars on legal teams that look for ways to get them out of contracts in regards to health insurance.
They have sold our privacy as a commodity.
They have used the military and police force to prevent freedom of the press. They have deliberately declined to recall faulty products endangering lives in pursuit of profit.
They determine economic policy, despite the catastrophic failures their policies have produced and continue to produce.
They have donated large sums of money to politicians, who are responsible for regulating them.
They continue to block alternate forms of energy to keep us dependent on oil.
They continue to block generic forms of medicine that could save peoples lives or provide relief in order to protect investments that have already turned a substantial profit.
They have purposely covered up oil spills, accidents, faulty bookkeeping, and inactive ingredients in pursuit of profit.
They purposefully keep people misinformed and fearful through their control of the media.
They have accepted private contracts to murder prisoners even when presented with serious doubts about their guilt.
They have perpetuated colonialism at home and abroad. They have participated in the torture and murder of innocent civilians overseas.
They continue to create weapons of mass destruction in order to receive government contracts."

Do otherwise than all of the above, for starters.

I can get more economics-technical for you if you like, but there's no evidence I can see from any of your posts that you would understand it, so for the moment I'll let this speak for itself.

 

WHO is THEY?

 

Rich people.

What a bunch of utter horseshit. If I sat a bunch of middle-schoolers down and asked them to write a protest manifesto, that's what they would come up with.
 
 
 
liberal ansswer to I got no answer.. drag out the strawman. why can't you answer?

 

Because it is a straw man and as such deserves no answer.

Was it TDM that said earlier in this thread that these people weren't Lemmings? Bullshit. they are all a bunch of lazy whiners following a few morons who are telling them that they deserve to get rich off the work of others.

They're hardly lazy, but sure.

Before I present the polls, please check this out for clarification of what OWS's grievances are:  Occupy Wall Street Manifesto | vegasmike433 on Xanga 

On foreclosure:  Views on Government Aid Depend on the Program 

(I may refer to this poll again on other issues. Specifically, note the support for a jobs program.)

On bonuses to CEOs, especially those whose companies received bailout money:  http://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/pdf/Mar09b-AIG.pdf 

On unions and the right to collective bargaining:  Poll: Americans favor union bargaining rights - USATODAY.com 

On raising taxes on the rich:  Americans Favor Jobs Plan Proposals, Including Taxing Rich 

On corporate donations to politicians and the Citizens United decision:  Poll: Large majority opposes Supreme Court's decision on campaign financing 

These are just a few points that I could easily find polls for, but as you can see, many of the grievances listed by OWS have widespread public support. I'm not sure quite 100% of them do (not at all sure how most people feel about cruelty to farm animals for example), but the core issues do.

No, I think you misunderstand. It is not the issues that people disagree with. It is the remedies or solutions that these lazy kids propose.

Basically when you start crying that you owe too much on the student loans that you took out for your own benefit therefore the government should intervene on your behalf is where people have the problems.

I don't believe that most Americans agree with your point of view that we should become a Socialist nation. Most of us can agree that Health Care needs to be reformed. But that does not mean that most Americans believe that we should mandate everyone carry insurance or that the government should run Health Care.

In regards to the poll about AIG, I thought it was wrong of the financial industry to pay out those large bonuses after receiving the bailout. That does not mean I, or most Americans, would support a takeover by the government of AIG or the financial industry as a whole.

Most of us can agree that there are problems with corporate America. That doesn't mean most Americans want to Socialize the nation.

Now, I see I have to reply to Mr. Nick and I am going to cut this reply short and await your reply.

They're fucking ignorant losers, and I'm not shocked they're ignorant to our economic problems... They pay less to the government in which they receive - that tapped out the government and they expect the government to tax people more so the government can continue to give them free programs..

They're ignorant lazy little pukes...

They're addicted to handouts because they're either a) lazy or b) stupid...

But that would be like expecting an apple to grow legs and walk...

 

Speaking of apples... I bet Apple is their twitter god.. know what I mean?

 

As Glenn Beck pointed out today. Ever wonder how so many poor protesters can afford Apples? Seems like almost all of them had one in which to capture video and stream it live.
 
 
 
 
 
Tell me, dear, was it a lot of work stuffing all that straw into that straw man? How long did it take you?  

 

The question's still pending....

 

Pending but threatening to destroy the brainwashing.

What specifically WILL you replace the system with?

Capitalism doesn't work in your mind. History shows central planning doesn't work. So... What's left?

 

capitalism works when the governments keep their greedy hands off of the model.

Socialism is thievery, and violates property rights - especially the farmers.

History has proven government dictation of economies is lethal...

Socialism is lethal...
 
 
 
 
 
"nor can you spell"

I stopped punctuation a few weeks ago, however I wouldn't call punctuation "spelling" you ignorant motherfucker.

Of course you think I need "help" because I don't think like your authoritarian punk ass..

You're a Maoist loser that does as it's told...

 

You are the ignorant jackass that spelled the two words, Oh really -- as O'rilly. I can't help the fact that you are an idiot through and through.

I think you need help because I happen to be on your side on most issues and you are completely unable to intellectualize that. You are nothing short of an idiot which has been pointed out to you many times.

Immie

 

You claim I can't spell because I used a euphemism?

Then you call me an idiot but you claim you agree with the "idiot" on most issues?

How about you go your way and you can continue to agree with this idiot?

Good compromise?

 

I'll compromise in this manner if you wish, but I don't generally have any problems with you except for the fact that you seem to have this need to attack me unprovoked whenever you enter a thread I have posted in. Also, I will not agree to not post in a thread just because you have posted in it.

It seems to me that you are the one that instigates these clashes maybe you see it differently. I don't attack you. Rather it is you that feel the need to constantly attack me as you did in this thread.

For some stupid reason, you seem to think that you know me better than I know myself.

Just because I think you are an idiot doesn't mean that I am not conservative. There are plenty of conservatives who are idiots, but not all conservatives are idiots.

A better compromise would be if you would simply call me out when I espouse an idea that you think is wrong. I'm fine with that. I am definitely not always right, but I don't think you know me as well as you think you do.

Immie
 
 
 
 
Okay, How are you going to CHANGE capitalism? what's yer plan?

 

I could give you my own ideas, and have done so elsewhere in this forum, but you're asking about the leftist insurgency generally rather than me, so I'll refer you to begin with to the Declaration of the Occupation of New York City. Think of this as a list of grievances similar to those in the Declaration of Independence (on which it may have been patterned):

 Declaration of the Occupation of New York City | NYC General Assembly 

"They have taken our houses through an illegal foreclosure process, despite not having the original mortgage.
They have taken bailouts from taxpayers with impunity, and continue to give Executives exorbitant bonuses.
They have perpetuated inequality and discrimination in the workplace based on age, the color of ones skin, sex, gender identity and sexual orientation.
They have poisoned the food supply through negligence, and undermined the farming system through monopolization.
They have profited off of the torture, confinement, and cruel treatment of countless animals, and actively hide these practices.
They have continuously sought to strip employees of the right to negotiate for better pay and safer working conditions.
They have held students hostage with tens of thousands of dollars of debt on education, which is itself a human right.
They have consistently outsourced labor and used that outsourcing as leverage to cut workers healthcare and pay.
They have influenced the courts to achieve the same rights as people, with none of the culpability or responsibility.
They have spent millions of dollars on legal teams that look for ways to get them out of contracts in regards to health insurance.
They have sold our privacy as a commodity.
They have used the military and police force to prevent freedom of the press. They have deliberately declined to recall faulty products endangering lives in pursuit of profit.
They determine economic policy, despite the catastrophic failures their policies have produced and continue to produce.
They have donated large sums of money to politicians, who are responsible for regulating them.
They continue to block alternate forms of energy to keep us dependent on oil.
They continue to block generic forms of medicine that could save peoples lives or provide relief in order to protect investments that have already turned a substantial profit.
They have purposely covered up oil spills, accidents, faulty bookkeeping, and inactive ingredients in pursuit of profit.
They purposefully keep people misinformed and fearful through their control of the media.
They have accepted private contracts to murder prisoners even when presented with serious doubts about their guilt.
They have perpetuated colonialism at home and abroad. They have participated in the torture and murder of innocent civilians overseas.
They continue to create weapons of mass destruction in order to receive government contracts."

Do otherwise than all of the above, for starters.

I can get more economics-technical for you if you like, but there's no evidence I can see from any of your posts that you would understand it, so for the moment I'll let this speak for itself.

 

Sounds like the soviet goals from 1963 warmed, up re hashed and served with a side of useful idiot fries and dumbass shake.

There is only a few places for the government in capitalism:

1. To ensure consumers, labors and competition are not abused by market power by unfair tactics that stifle business and fair competition or unfairly give advantage to one over another.

2. To make sure that those in the market are being truthful and honest about the product and business practices they employ.

3. To make sure that trade is facilitated by maintaining it's mandated infrastructure so the most people can benefit from the system.

4. To protect the consumer, labor and public from direct effects created by industry in the market, to be directly checked by the need to show both direct cause AND immediate harm to the parties involved.

Beyond that, they need to stay the fuck out.

liberal ansswer to I got no answer.. drag out the strawman. why can't you answer?

 

Because it is a straw man and as such deserves no answer.

 

Apprently this "strawman" is kicking the left's ass all day today.

Give us logistics on what you want to CHANGE to? Or are you just HOPING we quit asking you the obvious questions?

This kinda hopey changey shit doesn't get you a business loan, and it shouldn't win you political points either. Details, son... details. But see, this is what you know. We will hear what you really want to do and throw your ass down a dead philosophical mine shaft because what you will propose is probably the same shit that failed in the USSR, Eastern Europe and China before they tried to do Glasnost.
 
 
 
 
 
the only thing he supports is kool aid drinking ideology and someone else has to pay for his kool aid.

 

Yep, they/he/she favors whatever model gives them more than they pay in taxes (if anything).

They're fucking ignorant losers, and I'm not shocked they're ignorant to our economic problems... They pay less to the government in which they receive - that tapped out the government and they expect the government to tax people more so the government can continue to give them free programs..

They're ignorant lazy little pukes...

They're addicted to handouts because they're either a) lazy or b) stupid...

The sooner they realize the fact they're retards and need to learn a skill there is a demand for the better..

But that would be like expecting an apple to grow legs and walk...

 

Speaking of apples... I bet Apple is their twitter god.. know what I mean?

 

If they had it their way they would steal farmland from owners and would decimate the land in a matter of years for its food...

Farmers make sure their land is green - The government wont be able to do that.... If they even attempted to do it it would be like Pol Pots Cambodia er Khmer Rouge, beating former land owners over the head with farming tools until they submit to the establishment....

Yet the socialists think socialism is utopia...

I suppose it will be different this time?    

Yeah let the ignorant fucks who want something for free sell us to the communists..

Progressives are political whores.

I believe true capitalism regulates itself through competition.

Capitalism is a perfect economic model but can be abused which hinders its effectiveness.

Socialism is an absolute failure on every level - because its not a structure its a philosophy... Socialism is a pseudo-economic structure and its really based on a philosophy.... Thats why it fails and it takes brutal totalitarians to dictate.

Not quite. The Gilded age proved that unfortunately. There must be an impartial judge and arbiter, not just the invisible hand involved. Monopolies and trusts are dangerous for all the same way a tyrant is.

The government needs to be involved a little as that arbiter and protector and objective observer. It's when it becomes MORE than that when problems erupt.

Asking questions about Solyndra is a waste of time? Interesting view point...

So when this Administration blows half a billion on loan guarantees that never should have been given...to a corporation whose honchos were major campaign contributors TO this Administration...that shouldn't be questioned?
 
 
ESPN Pulls 'Monday Night Football' Opener After Singer Slams Obama

 

 
UPDATE: ESPN has released a statement expressing their disapproval of Williams' comments, and will pull his intro from tonight's Monday Night Football telecast.

“While Hank Williams, Jr. is not an ESPN employee, we recognize that he is closely linked to our company through the open to Monday Night Football. We are extremely disappointed with his comments, and as a result we have decided to pull the open from tonight’s telecast.”

A source at ESPN told The Huffington Post that they are still evaluating whether they will use the song in the future.

Former White House adviser Van Jones says that progressives are going to launch an "October offensive" to rival the Tea Party, in the spirit of the Arab Spring protests across the Middle East.

"Everybody should hold onto their seats. October is going to be the turning point when it comes to the progressive fight back. You can see it coming," Jones said this week on MSNBC's "The Last Word" with Lawrence O'Donnell.

"You are going to see an American Fall, an American Autumn, just like we saw the Arab Spring," Jones continued. "You can see it right now with these young people on Wall Street. Hold onto your hats, we're going to have an October offensive to take back the American dream and to rescue America's middle class."

I support their effort in general. They are trying to get organized. I'm sure reasonable goals will be defined and refinded as they go along.

At least they aren't violent and packing weapons. Someone has to take back America - and I sure as hell don't want it to be Hank Williams teabaggers.
