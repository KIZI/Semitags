Myanmar's two main opposition parties Friday accused the political group
representing the military regime of "cheating" and "threatening" voters ahead of
the country's first election in two decades.

The Democratic Party (Myanmar) and the National Democratic Force (NDF)
complained that the junta-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP)
has illegally collected advance votes for Sunday's poll.

Democratic Party chairman Thu Wai told AFP his party had written to the Union
Election Commission in the capital Naypyidaw outlining the accusations, while
the NDF made similar claims but has yet to file an official complaint.
