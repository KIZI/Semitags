Support is growing in Sweden for a far-right party ahead of September 19
elections, a poll showed Tuesday, suggesting the group could enter parliament
and even determine the outcome of the vote.

The United Minds-Cint poll, published in the Aftonbladet daily, handed the
Sweden Democrats (SD) a record 6.5 percent support -- well above the four
percent threshold for entering parliament.

Nearly 46 percent of people intended to vote for the ruling centre-right
coalition while 45 percent said they would vote for the left-wing opposition
coalition, the poll of 2,004 people between July 12 and August 1 showed.

With less than a percentage point difference between the two main blocs, the
right-wing SD party, which has never before made it into parliament, would
likely become the kingmaker of the election, observers said.

"It is probable that we will have a very messy parliamentary situation after the
election," Carl Melin of United Minds told the paper.

The four parties in the centre-right coalition and the three main leftist
opposition parties have ruled out cooperating with SD but observers say it could
be difficult to block the far-right party from the decision-making process.

The Sweden Democrats leader, Jimmie Aakesson, said he was convinced the two main
blocs would rethink their stance as his party gains in popularity.

"They don't want to give up their power in the parliament, that is what is most
important for them," he told the news agency TT.

If either bloc manages to secure a parliamentary majority, SD would not make
much difference, political scientist Peter Santesson-Wilson of the Ratio
research institute in Stockholm told AFP.

However, "a minority government would be very unstable if it refused to ever
vote with (SD)," he said, pointing out that the party could for instance choose
to vote on the opposition's, rather than the minority government's, budget
proposal.

"That would cause political chaos and the government would quickly be forced to
resign," he said.

The Sweden Democrats won just 2.9 percent of the vote in the country's last
elections in 2006. The party argues that Sweden should remain a "homogeneous
society" by drastically cutting the numbers of immigrants.
