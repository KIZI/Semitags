The Pakistani federal government filed a petition at the Lahore High Court on
Tuesday, seeking a ban on the free movement of renowned nuclear scientist Abdul
Qadeer Khan, local TV channel reported.

The petition said that the liberty granted to Qadeer is a threat to national
security, the private TV DAWN News reported.

It has been reported that the nuclear scientist has shared sensitive information
in an interview with an American newspaper.

Earlier the High Court had granted permission to Qadeer to live as a free
citizen. The federal government has appealed that the scientist be kept under
constant surveillance by authorities and a security escort be assigned to him.

The court has issued notification to Qadeer for Jan. 25.

Qadeer was detained in December 2003 and admitted in early 2004 sole
responsibility for operating a network that spread nuclear weapons technology to
some countries.

He was pardoned by then President Pervez Musharraf, but immediately placed under
de facto house arrest. In February 2009, the Islamabad High Court announced he
was a "free citizen," subject to a confidential accord struck with the
government.

The government said the restrictions are necessary for his own safety. While
reviled in the West, Qadeer is regarded as a hero by many in Pakistan because he
led the country's efforts to produce a nuclear weapon.
