I know its a PJ newsgroup, but this is the only one I ever post in, so I
thought I say how awesome ACDC was last night.

It was the Edmonton show and a storm blew over during the concert.
There was a shitload of rain coming down (plus thunder and lightning!)
during ACDC's set.  The crowd got soaked, the band got soaked but it was
incredible!

I think it was also the biggest crowd I've seen at a concert (50k plus).
The storm didn't stop anyonebody, not the crowd, not the band.

They did stop between songs to shove some of the water of the stage, but
other then that they kept playing.  I have to give them credit for that,
because it must of been some pretty shit conditions on the stage.

The scene of them play in the rain, getting soaked, with lightning the
background was surreal.

Probably one of those concert of a lifetime things.
