Greenland upgraded its political status into self-rule from home rule on Sunday,
said reports reaching here from Nuuk, capital of the Arctic island.

Greenland will take control of the police and the courts and have its official
language Greenlandic, a language related to Inuit, according to the self-rule
agreement approved by Greenlanders in a referendum in November.

Greenland will also keep a greater share of revenue from its natural resources,
although much of the oil, gas, gold and diamonds the island holds has been
inaccessible because of the Arctic ice that covers most of the land mass.

But the security, foreign and monetary issues in Greenland will still be decided
by Denmark in the future.

Danish Queen Margrethe, dressed in Greenlandic national costumes, handed over
the self-rule documents to the Speaker of Greenland's Parliament, Josef
Motzfeldt at a ceremony in Nuuk. Danish Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen
also attended the ceremony.

Greenland, which is the largest island in the world with more than 57,000
inhabitants, is part of the Kingdom of Denmark and has had home rule since 1979.
