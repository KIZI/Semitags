To all the Hilltop Yankee Fans (Box, Cliff, Michael O, Mike C., etc)

Congratulations on your 13th consecutive playoff appearance, and a truly great 2nd half comeback....Best of luck to the pinstripes in the post season....and best of luck to Paul Flieg and his long suffering Cubbies....Now, if you'd be kind enough to excuse me while I prepare to say Kaddish for the Mets, and then quietly adjourn to the kitchen where I will be placing my head firmly inside the oven.....
