Sheep: 24 (average of what we have allowed last 2 games, rounded
down optimistically)
SeaVictims: Â  9 (average of what we have scored last 2 games, rounded up
optimistically)

This team looks pathetically outcoached, out played, out managed and
completely disorganized.
Clock management is atrocious, the offensive line is.. well, offensive, even
Wally got beat this week.

These are NOT talent issues they are purely coaching and game planning
issues..

-----
Picking the correct winning team (2 pts)
(regardless of which team you pick)

1 Pt each for:
Exact (or closest to)Seattle Score
Exact (or closest to)Opponent Score

**IF** you have the winner **AND**

Exact (or closest to)spread (1pt)
Total (or closest to)points scored (1pt)
Closest to actual score (1pt)

This last will be an arbitrary and assigned point,
usually only one person gets this point.
This means SOMEBODY will get a point if they pick
a tie and the game actually ends in a tie, even if
they pick say 1-1 (except as their "default" score)
and the game finishes 55-55, and that over everybody else
picking either 54-55, 55-56 etc.
This will reflect a small reward for having the right
sense about a game.
I will only give out ONE of these awards per week
and many weeks I will not give out any! (if 2 or
more folks get the exact score, likely I will NOT
give anybody the closest to award.)

Maximum (per week) possible 7pts for exact score.
