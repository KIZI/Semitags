Justice Department lawyers are reluctantly defending a law that
bars the
federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages, making
their legal
arguments in a Boston court while pointing out that the Obama
administration opposes the measure.

Government attorneys said in a brief filed yesterday in US
District Court
that the administration believes the federal Defense of Marriage
Act, which
bars the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages, is
discriminatory and wants it repealed.

"Consistent with the rule of law, however, the Department of
Justice has
long followed the practice of defending federal statutes as long as
reasonable arguments can be made in support of their
constitutionality,
even if the department disagrees with a particular statute as a
policy
matter, as it does here," the attorneys said.

The law defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman.
Six
same-sex couples and three men whose husbands have died - one of
the
deceased was retired Massachusetts congressman Gerry E. Studds -
have filed
a lawsuit, asserting that the law treats them like second-class
citizens
and is unconstitutional.

Because of the law, the plaintiffs said, they were excluded from
using
federal benefits that opposite-sex couples can obtain, including
health
insurance programs for federal employees, retirement and survivor
benefits
under the Social Security Act, and the ability to file joint
federal income
tax returns.

Janson Wu - a lawyer for Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders,
which is
representing the plaintiffs - said the legal team was prepared for
the
government's motion to dismiss, which closely resembled the Obama
administration's response to a similar lawsuit filed by a southern
California gay couple. A federal court dismissed that suit on Aug.
24.

"There's nothing in the brief that we were unprepared to deal
with, and
there's nothing in the government's brief that addresses the fact
the DOMA
is the only exception in a long history of the federal government's
deferral to the states' determination of who is married," he said.

Martin Koski, a 67-year-old retired federal employee who became
a
plaintiff after the government refused to extend federal health
benefits to
his husband, James Fitzgerald, said he should be treated no
differently
from other federal retirees.

"We're married in the state of Massachusetts, and the federal
government,
as far as we're concerned, has chosen to disregard that and say
we're
second-class citizens," said the Bourne man, who married
Fitzgerald two
years ago.

Koski said that he had voted for Obama in the election, but that
he was
not upset with him.

"Congress makes the law, and until Congress decides to do
something about
it, I guess there's not much the executive branch can do," he
said. "If
someone feels it's not right, we have to go through the process,
and,
hopefully, it will get to the Supreme Court and they'll make a just
decision for us."

Legal specialists have said the suit filed in March was the
first serious
challenge by a group of plaintiffs to the federal law passed in
1996.

The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the first in the nation to
legalize gay
marriage, filed a separate challenge to the law in July.

The lawyers who submitted the Boston brief yesterday included US
Assistant
Attorney General Tony West and Michael Loucks, the acting US
attorney in
Boston.

The government argued the court should not act as a
"superlegislature,"
judging the wisdom of a law, but must uphold the DOMA "so long as
there is
any reasonably conceivable set of facts that could provide a
rational basis
for it."

Congress was entitled to address social reforms on a piecemeal
basis and
provide benefits only to those who have historically been allowed
to marry,
the government argued.
