Premier Silvio Berlusconi's ruling People of Freedom (PdL) party on Thursday
said there was no need for early elections, contradicting its key ally the
Northern League.

"We're all completely convinced that we shouldn't go for an early vote," Foreign
Minister Franco Frattini said after a PdL meeting.

Northern League leader Umberto Bossi, who on Wednesday said he was prepared to
bring down the government himself to force an early election, said he thinks
"reason and wisdom will prevail on the League's part too."

Berlusconi said earlier Thursday that "we have the numbers and we will go
forward."

The remark prompted observers to speculate that he was confident of winning a
confidence vote on a five-point revamped policy platform at the end of the month
even without the 34 votes of Future and Freedom (FLI), a group established by
House Speaker Gianfranco Fini after he was ejected by the PdL in July.

Berlusconi was eager to show he doesn't need the support of the rebels led by
Fini, who have deprived the government of a safe majority in the House, local
media reported.

Bossi on Wednesday said early elections were the best way out of the "quagmire"
and if needed, he would pull the government's house down by voting no in the
confidence vote expected Sept. 28th or 29th.

Frattini assured reporters Thursday, however, that Berlusconi would be able to
persuade his old ally that such a drastic move was not needed.

Rome Mayor Gianni Alemanno, a PdL heavyweight and former member of Fini's pre-
PdL rightist party, said he was "prepared to wage 200,000 euros that the
government will go on."

Observers say the Northern League is in favor of having elections soon because
polls show it would be the biggest gainer.

According to polls, the PdL and Northern League would be returned in a snap
vote, with a slimmer majority.
