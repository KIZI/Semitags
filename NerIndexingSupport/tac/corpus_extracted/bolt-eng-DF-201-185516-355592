 
 
Do CTists believe that ANY Muslim-extremist terror attacks were real?
 
 
it seems like these days, conspiracy theorists will dismiss ANY and EVERY terrorist attack by either an actual Islamist organization or even just an extremist-Muslim lone wolf, as a false-flag CIA op.

do they believe that Islamic extremism even exists? do they believe that 100% of Muslims around the world are peaceful and believe in cotton candy and sugarplums?
 
 
I highly doubt CT nutters will ever believe Muslim extremism as long as it is used as part of the explanation for such events. The goal of the CT mindset is to place oneself in the role of Heroic Defender of the Truth against a unstoppable and all-powerful wave of elite forces hell-bent on world domination, destruction, chaos, and general doom.

As part of that worldview, any explanation for any event which comes from the government must by default be a disinformation/false flag/etc. op designed to stop the truth. As such, when Muslim extremists do actually do something that harms people - from 9/11 to the recent plane incident - the CT crowd will NEVER accept it.

I think of the CT crowd as doing whatever it takes to make it look like they are going against "the MAN" - it would be interesting to see what would happen if the government came out and said that such things were simply failed false flag attempts...would the CT nutjobs then proclaim that it was really Muslim extremists if their views became mainstream?
 
 
Even if they are real, they were radicalized by the US government.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3LlA3ht55c  Alex Jones has the info!

where was AJ on 9-11?
 
 
All of them were ZOG false-flag attacks.

I believe that there are definitely extremist fundementalist Muslims that have been involved in terrorist acts for decades......The same can be said of some fundementalist Christians in the US....Are you aware that there are also Jewish Zionist extremists supported and funded by the US and the State of Israel that are responsible for numerous acts of terrorism and espionage throughout the world since before the State Of Israel existed? Some of these arrogant maniacs actually believe that just by being Jewish they are chosen by God to reign over others, much like Nazis and KKK members. Also they have a large nuclear arsenal. Quite alarming, I'd say...
 
 
How did a thread about Muslim extremists get transformed into a CT rant room about how they hate the joos?
 
 
 
Please provide examples of 1 person - in any position of reasonable authority - for which you have proof that they (1) believe that they are chosen by god to reign over others and (2) have access to a nuclear arsenal.

You know, the jew haters really have got to update their propaganda. This canard has been debunked so many times. Just because some orthodox jews may believe that their ancestors were "gods chosen people" does not mean those same people believe their actions are sanctioned by their God nor do they believe that it gives them any innate authority over others.

By the way...how did a thread about Muslim extremists get transformed into a CT rant room about how they hate the joos?

 
Is this thread only for those who hate Muslim extremists?

"If a Jew needs a liver, can you take the liver of an innocent non-Jew passing by to save him? The Torah would probably permit that. Jewish life has an infinite value, he explained. There is something infinitely more holy and unique about Jewish life than non-Jewish life."

Fail, CTer.

CT Tactic #1: When confronted with the obvious that you cannot deny, beat down a straw man.

CT Tactic #2: When called for evidence, provide a quote that has absolutely no connection with your claim.

Conveniently, I cannot actually find your quote except on lovely sites like DAVID DUKE'S WEBSITE and STORM FRONT. Good to know where you do your research.

This Statement you conveniently cannot find was made by a Lubavitch Rabbi named Yitshak Ginsburgh and it can be found in the April 26, 1996 Jewish Week.....No doubt, David Duke forced him to write it, and Jewish Week to publish it....We all know how much power Duke has over the Lubavich Rabbis and Jewish Weekly.....LOL

  If you would like a thread about Jewish terrorism, please start one. In this thread, the topic is Muslim terrorism. Stay on topic. Posted By:LibraryLady

Sure it was. Problem is no one can seem to provide a scan of it, and it just happens to be all over white supremacist and Neo-Nazi websites - which apparently share your views. Interestingly, I can't find any publication called Jewish Week...for such a important publication, they don't have anything online?

And were still awaiting evidence. Even if the quote were true - and it probably isn't - it still is not evidence for your original claim. Still waiting. We're going to be waiting for a while, aren't we?

You really need to work better at spreading Neo-Nazi propaganda.

You providing unverified quotes which are most likely fake that come straight from Neo-Nazi cites does nothing except prove your own warped world view. It does not prove the joos are out there to destroy us all with their nuclear arsenal.

That was not my argument at all. My position is as it has always been that the 911 attacks had little to do with Muslim extremism and everything to do with US, British, and Israeli imperialism. The evidence shows that certain sectors of Islamic nations such as Saudi Arabian and Pakistani intel ops were involved in the attacks. The so called extremists, al Queda have always been and still are CIA lackeys...I am not in favor of any terrorism or war crimes regardless of who is behind them. Bush=Clinton=Bush=Obama....all whores to the power brokers in NY London and Tel-Aviv...

we Jews are very used to people accusing us of crimes we did not commit, with zero evidence. we've been facing this for more than 2,000 years.

Why do you suppose that the murderers at the King David Hotel were directed by former Prime Minister Begin to dress up like Arabs to plant the explosives? Ever heard of the Lavon Affair? Look it up. Why do you suppose that the Israeli Spies arrested in NJ after they were observed filming and celebrating the deaths of 3000 Americans told the NJ Highway Patrol that the Palistinians did it? Your boys are not just poor innocent people that are always getting blamed for crimes they didn't commit champ. They have been involved in some pretty filthy deals in the last 60 years. I read somewhere that some of their leaders are wanted for war crimes right now. If I were a Jew, I would try to get these guys to clean up their act instead of whining and making weak excuses for their repulsive behavior. Their actions reflect on you..There's an idea!!

Not necessesary....Most of these so called zionist apoligists KNOW the quote is real and they agree with it wholeheartedly. Then there's parky who knows that rampant bigotry and hatred exists, yet he doesn't want to alienate himself from the others, so he cries derail!!. Those words were not meant for goy eyes. Just like these ones from the "Grand Rebbe" (Sounds KKKish-like Imperial Wizard) of Chabad Lubavitch, Menacham Schneerson, who eloquently stated.....

" The difference between a Jewish and a non-Jewish person stems from the common expression: Let us differentiate. Thus, we do not have a case of profound change in which a person is merely on a superior level. Rather, we have a case of let us differentiate between totally different species. This is what needs to be said about the body: the body of a Jewish person is of a totally different quality from the body of [members] of all nations of the world 

An even greater difference exists in regard to the soul. Two contrary types of soul exist, a non-Jewish soul comes from three satanic spheres, while the Jewish soul stems from holiness.

We therefore ask: Why should a non-Jew be punished if he kills even a non-Jewish embryo while a Jew should not be punished even if he kills a Jewish embryo? The answer can be understood by [considering] the general difference between Jews and non-Jews: A Jew was not created as a means for some [other] purpose; he himself is the purpose, since the substance of all divine emanations was created only to serve the Jews.
 
 
Yes, the conspiracy theorists do believe that there was one terrorist attack committed by Middle Easterners.

 Oklahoma City .
 
 
 
it seems like these days, conspiracy theorists will dismiss ANY and EVERY terrorist attack by either an actual Islamist organization or even just an extremist-Muslim lone wolf, as a false-flag CIA op.

do they believe that Islamic extremism even exists? do they believe that 100% of Muslims around the world are peaceful and believe in cotton candy and sugarplums?

 
Conspiracy mongers have never met a terrorist they didn't like.

All terrorist attacks according to these loons are either government sponsored (Black Flag) operations or the terrorists are acting under "mind control" by the... can you guess?... evil gubment.

They are also largely, but not completely, racists ("Arabs in Caves") or anti-Semitic (the anti-Semitism finding cover under "anti-Zionism).

the attack in the King David Hotel was not a false-flag attack. the Irgun claimed responsibility for it and Israelis honor the attack till this day.

the 1993 WTC bombing was done by Muslim extremists. they were found guilty in a court of law. do you respect America's justice system?

They do it with JFK's "secrecy" speech, they do it with Albert Pike, and on and on and on.

Then again, even if you could prove this quote is real (and you won't), IT STILL HAS NO RELATIONSHIP TO YOUR CLAIM THAT THE JOOS WANT TO DESTROY US ALL WITH THEIR NUCLEAR ARSENAL. Do you know why? Because you have no evidence.

Don't you wish the world were like you want to be in your little fantasy here. In my experience majority of people who debunk CTs come from three sources:

(1) They are former members of the CT woo community that embraced reason.
(2) They come from a racial, ethnic, or other group which has historically been targets of CT nutjobs (jews, African Americans, freemasons, etc.)
(3) In the course of researching some issue they stumbled across CT nuttery and were astounded by the stupidity.

The only person who gets programmed are the conspiracy theorists who so desperately want to fight against the MAN and believe that they aren't responsible for their own station in life that they choose to believe in your fantasies.

You haven't researched a single piece of the racist propaganda you've tried and failed to represent as fact in this thread, and you never will - because its not about the truth for you, its about the desire to feel special and all knowing.

No wonder half the board has you on ignore - its not worth even responding to you because your responses are so filled with ignorance and stupidity that you debunk yourself. Ignored, troll.

Don't feed the racist troll, guys. Hes just a kid playing Xbox and making himself feel special by thinking he knows the TWOOF. Unfortunately he fails at the Xbox thing:

If you read the writings and works of "Grand Rebbe" (Imperial Wizard)Menacham Schneerson or any of the many advocates of this sick cult (Chabad Lubavitch) you will find the quote I cited and many more that are even more offensive and ridiculous than the one I posted. The tact that you and what's his name are taking is laughable. (prove it on line or I'll pretend that the ahole didn't say it) Are you and your buddy asserting that these quotes are made up? WRONG champ. Both are mild examples of the sick racism which thrives in high circles of zio-world. There are high ranking leaders of the zionist movement that are every bit as ignorant, arrogant and disgusting as any tobbacco spitting moron speaking at a KKK meeting in Mississippi. The only difference is that the KKK guys generally have below room temp IQs and the Lebavitchers are usually fairly intelligent and well read. What I am trying to convey is anything but "anti-semitic"....You live in NY....Go to the library and check out those quotes....THEY ARE GENUINE CHAMP, and I think you know this all too well. Why do you continue to defend these racist supremicist slimes? ANYONE who uses words like shiksa to describe a non jewish woman or goy to describe non jews is just as bad as ignorant stupid southern racists who call black people ******* or jewish people kikes.....
 
 
A bit more relevant to the OP than this derailment:

Do CTists believe ANY Muslim-extremist terror attacks were real?

Well, over at Craig Murray's blog, his entourage of wierdo Truthers who love him, not necessarily for blowing the whistle on genuine instances of torture by Uzbekistan's government but because it made him an establishment critic of the US and UK, are pretty confident that the bony evil hand of the US/UK and Israel is present in the latest attempted airplane bombing. They're using all kinds of groundbreaking logic to do so:

 http://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archiv..._nigerian.html 

But, I did discover a Truther who seems to believe Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was an acomplice in the 9/11 attacks. Presumably because it took all responsibility away from him having to present any evidence of his innocence to the court and being exposed and prosecuted for perverting the course of justice. This Truther was, of course, none other than Richard Gage:

What is this "debate by quotes" stuff jmh423 does?
 
 
False flags succeed- Only the evil NWO could pull them off.

Botched attacks are real- Terrorists live in caves and are stupid.
 
 
Hey JMH423- got a source for that quote yet?

 
 
 
 
What is this "debate by quotes" stuff jmh423 does?

 
Its a pretty common tactic used by CTers - argument by quotation. Over the years the CT community has either (1) completely made up or (2) woefully taken out of context a ton of quotes that CTs think proves their arguments. Since CTers don't actually do any research beyond finding the quote and thinking it must be true, they repeat it and it gets picked up by other CTers.

Even if they were all true - and I have yet to find even one actual CT quote that was not a complete lie or so taken out of context that the original text does not say what they claim - it still would be arguing via appeals to authority. They think that because some famous person said something in support of a CT existing, that it MUST mean it exists. Its a fallacy.

In the case of jmh, in his fantasy world that because some Rabbi said something about jews being better than non-jews (even if the quote were real - which he has not shown evidence for), THIS MUST be evidence for a vast global jewish plot against us all. It couldn't possibly be that some crazy person who happened to be jewish said something that everyone thought was nuts and ignored.
 
 
To me it's not so much the "argument by quotation" tactic that is the main problem here. I recall watching a story on 60 Minutes, 20/20 or some similar program back in the early 90s about Rabbi Schneerson. He was definitely an odd duck with some controversial views. Of course I can't back that up either unless I find a video on the web about the original piece.

The real dishonest and intellectually lazy tactic we should be having a problem with here is jmh's trying to change the subject of the discussion. jmh423; if you want to discuss Schneerson, start a new thread devoted to that topic, don't derail another thread that has absolutely nothing at all to do with the subject at hand. Far too many discussions between skeptics and woos of various stripes seem to go like this:

woo: I assert X!
skeptic: No, X is not true and here's why (goes on to make the case)
woo: Oh yeah? Well what about Y?
skeptic: Whoa, wait a minute. Are you tacitly admitting that you were wrong about X?
woo: Stop dodging the question! What about Y and Z while we're at it?
 
 
  Derail over. Back to the topic in the OP please. Posted By:Gaspode
 
 
I honestly don't think that they believe that ANY of the extremist muslim terrorist attacks that have happened since around, oh, say about 1940's or so.

I haven't found a single CTer to agree that there are certain extremists that want us dead, and for no other reason than a silly religious belief.

I honestly believe that there are religious extremists of many sects that are so crazy that they believe killing and bombing innocents is their duty. Some are Muslims, some are Hindus, some are Christians and some are Jews. The most dangerous are the ones who have access to leaders of militarily powerful countries such as the US, Israel, and UK. That is why I pointed out the danger of this crazed bunch called the Chabad Lubavitchers. Racist, supremicist maniacs in positions of power are extremely dangerous to all of us.

name ONE Lubavitcher who is in a position of power, either in the USA or in Israel.

JMH423, you have no idea what you are talking about.

got a source for that Schneerson quote yet? didn't think so.
 
 
 
the burden of proof is on YOU to prove these quotes are real.

provide evidence, or they are anti-Semitic lies.

 
What an idiotic assertion!! He either said it or he didn't....That is all that matters....Pointing out outrageous statements does not constitute "anti-semitism" except in ADL world....Do you live there champ?

When leaders of a crazed sect of racist supremicists are given access to US Presidents, and Israeli Prime Ministers I consider them to be in positions of power. Kind of like if the Imperial Wizard of the KKK was photographed shaking hands with a sitting US President in the White House...I would consider that a problem. See what I mean?

the attack in the King David Hotel was not a false-flag attack. the Irgun claimed responsibility for it and Israelis honor the attack till this day.

THIS !
King David Hotel bombing  WP 
Disguised as Arabs, Irgunists planted a bomb in the basement of the main building
of the hotel, under the wing which housed the Mandate Secretariat and part of the
British military headquarters.

 
the 1993 WTC bombing was done by Muslim extremists. they were found guilty in a court of law. do you respect America's justice system?

 
Fonebone <i Yes I do respect the American justice system and a black civil rights worker in Mississippi or an Arab/Muslum in New York could expect
a fair and balanced show trial conducted by hand-picked judges selected
to ensure the desired verdict.
In the WTC 1993 bombing the hand picked judges were nice Jewish boys
and in Mississippi the hand picked judges were respectable Christians.

OH - And you did request evidence--

of the World Trade Center in 1993."

Mossad operative named Guzie Hadas."

I don't see what difference it makes if he did say it. There are extremists in every religion. It doesn't prove anything apart from that.

the judge who presided over that trial was named Kevin Duffy  WP  i cant find any information about his religion, but does that sound like the name of a "nice Jewish boy"?

Tut tut, don't you realise that won't be his real name?! He'll have changed it so he can infiltrate the justice system and execute his part in the zionist agenda  

In fact, his parents probably changed their names, put him through law school etc. knowing that he would one day be involved in the 911 trial.

As to the thread topic, the answer is no. It's just more evidence of the endgame they have planned.

The Jews seem to be getting it from all angles at the moment. Not only do they have to put up with it from Nazis but there's the new generation of jew hating muslims at it as well, all pinning atrocities like 911 on the Jews instead of looking in their own backyards. There's a kind of tag-team effort against the Jews from the far right and radical/extremist islam.

No it's not just you, and I am not a "Jew Hater". Are you a Muslim hater?...I guess that what you are referring to, (pointing out troubling realities no matter whose feathers get ruffled), is a by product of the free flow of information that the internet has created. Are you in favor of limiting this info to "accredited sources" like AP and Reuters? It was nice while it lasted for the scum of the earth but now the BS monopoly has been forever SHATTERED....Let FREEDOM RING....

 http://alyahya.blogspot.com/2009/11/...d-leaders.html 

This is a GREAT source of truth.....

Excerpts:

When the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace" - Jimi Hendrix -(anti-semitic hater)

and.....

"Before you look at the photos above, I want you to consider something...

Think about the people who rule your country... with their thousand dollar suits, their chic stretch limousines, their 200 dollar luncheons - paid for by you, of course - their many lucrative contacts with moneyed-up corporate sponsors, as well as their ties to "big banks" and "special interest" groups of all kinds...

Think about YOUR untouchable leaders.

Now ask yourself honestly:

How many of these so-called "leaders" would actually take the time to meet with us, if we so desired?

How many of these "leaders" would not only set aside the time to meet with us, but actually invite us into their work environment, so that we may confide in them; so that we may express our heartfelt desires for the betterment of our people and our families?

Not too many, I hear you say.

Indeed, no matter how you look at it, whether you admire your leaders, or despise them; we all know that the vast majority of them would NEVER voluntarily meet with "us".

Enter the Jewish Chabad-Lubavitch..."

Let us EXPOSE this pack of RABID RACIST SUPREMICIST LUNATICS....(Talk about "tin foil hatters")....Who seem to be respected by world leaders throughout the globe....And relagate them back to the CARNY ACT that they truly are like the KKK or the Skokie Nazis...Thanks

The topic of this thread is whether or not certain people believe that religious maniacs exist who are a party to terrorism. What I am pointing out is directly on topic. Again, I believe that there are several sects of religious lunitics who are responsible for murder and terrorism. The one I am focusing on is underpublicised as such, and I am giving those who are unaware of this FACT a heads up. Muslim extremism is highly publicised here in the US every day...Turn on an AM radio...24-7-365. That is what I call "ranting"....If you were not previously aware of the pack of wild eyed racist supremicist lunitics I am referring to then you were "asleep"...so, WAKE UP. Thanks

Islamic terrorism has been proven to exist on countless occasions, when have any of these people (in the pictures on the blog for example) been linked to anything similar? Can you even name any of them? Can provide one shred of evidence that they are doing what you say they're doing?

I never said you were off topic, I said no one will believe a word you say without providing evidence. Your unwillingness to do so speaks volumes. I'm not sure why you believe the things you do, but you can't expect anyone else to do so without proof.

What is happening right now and for the past 60 years is direct evidence of the power that these lunitics have. Read Schneersons Wiki page....Many thought he was some kind of god. They readily admit to believing crazy writings from the past such as:

Israelites are a “chosen people,” chosen by God above all the other peoples of the world.

Israelites have a right to rule over all other people and are promised that they will someday own and rule over the whole world.

Israelites are forbidden to make slaves of their own people, but are encouraged to enslave non-Israelites whom they may pass down as slaves to their descendants forever.

Israelites are forbidden to intermarry or “mix their seed” with other peoples.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >>>>

Now pardon me, but that sounds like racism and fanaticism to me........
People who believe such TRASH are likely to be predisposed to murdering enslaving and stealing land and property from those they consider to be lesser beings. (Which by the way, is EXACTLY what they have done)...... From Ben Gurion to Netanyahu the leaders of Israel have constantly espoused these idiotic fables and used them to justify their ongoing murderous reign of terror. And yes there have been documented cases of Islamic terrorism, true, but there also have been numerous and ongoing occasions where ZIONIST terrorism has been documented, proven and even celebrated by these lunitics. Learn some history, and get back to me. Thanks

And note how he ignores that the Chasad Lubavitchers are a pretty small group within Judaism, there Grand Rebbe's opinions carry no weight outside that small community.
Not that his characterization of the Lubavitchers is anywhere near accurate, though.

based on the small Jewish population of the Earth, it is clear that the percentage of Jews who marry outside of their faith is MUCH higher than the percentage of Christians or Muslims, who marry outside of THEIR faith.

and as far as slavery is concerned, those rules are 2,500 years old. so get a grip. ever heard of the White-Slave traffic act?

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mann_Act 

why should white-slavery be seen as any different than black slavery..hmmm?

 

oh, and then there is this:

Under the Christian Roman Empire

When Christianity became the state religion of Rome in the 4th century, Jews became objects of religious intolerance and political oppression. Christian literature began to display extreme hostility to Jews, and this occasionally resulted in attacks on Jews and the burning of synagogues.

Emperor  Constantine I  instituted several laws concerning Jews: they were forbidden to own Christian slaves or to circumcise their slaves. Conversion of Christians to Judaism was outlawed. Congregations for religious services were restricted, but Jews were allowed to enter Jerusalem on  Tisha B'Av , the anniversary of the destruction of the Temple.

Discrimination became worse in the 5th century. Jews were barred from the civil service and the army. The Jewish Patriarchate was abolished and the scope of Jewish courts restricted. New synagogues were confiscated and old synagogues could be repaired only if they were in danger of collapse. Synagogues fell into ruin or were converted to churches.

dude, the rules placed upon non-Jews that were NEVER under our authority, pales in comparison to the racist and insane rules placed upon Jews by our Christian rulers.

how you like them apples, tough guy?

And what were they doing at the Whitehouse? Do you know? And why are you so concerned about this group while ignoring the Bush admin's relationship with fundy christians for example? Answer: because they're Jews.

 
I was and remain very concerned with the unholy alliances with the whack job Christian Fundementalists like Falwell, Hagee, Dobson et al with US politics, not because they are "Christians" but because they are fundementalist whackos. I would also be wary of "fundy" Muslim whackos having access to our leaders. Religious racists and crazies should stay out of politics no matter what whacky sect they blindly follow. Thanks

I point out the Christians in the whitehouse as they directly influenced the gvmnt on such things as stem cell research, gay marriage and foreign policy in Israel. So what direct influence have the lubavitchers had? I'd say the end-timers whispering on the president's ear is much more dangerous than the lubavitchers.

That pack of religious whack jobs who directly influenced Bush, Regan, and others seems to have been exposed for the charlatons they are and thrown out as a result of the Abrahamson scandal. (By the way most of them are also rabid zionist creeps) Good. My question is this: Why aren't these whacko Jewish cults exposed and thrown out. Why does it seem that all US politicians are kissing their racist looney butts? They, and especially their Kaballist racist supremicist beliefs should be scorned by all men of good will regardless of their religion. I point out that the US blind support for the terrorist regime in place in Israel is a result of the power this cult holds over our whorish leaders. Call their influence direct or indirect, but the real question is why not publicly condemn these racist creeps like we finally did to the KKK? Truman was once a member, so was Robert Byrd and they both publicly renounced their affiliation years ago. Now its time to call these creepy supersticious racist whackos out and quit coddling them also. Thanks

Wolfowitz and Perle are both Jewish anyway, so why is it so surprising that they would want to support Israel? I still don't see where the lubavitchers really come into it. Maybe they do have friends in Washington who have similar ideals, so what? You not liking American foreign policy doesn't equate to there being a kabbalist conspiracy. There are Islamic states that wish to destroy Israel (i.e. Iran), so why should people stand by and do nothing?

Gaza is an issue fair enough, but that's not all down to the Israelis, seeing as it's chock full of islamic militants who oppose the very idea of the Israeli state.
 
 
 
burning like the Lebavitchers in their ridiculous garb and their outright support for Israeli terrorization of the Palistinians,

The link I posted above contains a bit about Desmond Tutu. The video also makes a distinction between criticism of jews, criticism of lobbying by the israeli government and CT rubbish like the lubavitch nonsense in this/other threads.

JMH423- what is your opinion of the Nazi expulsion and terrorization of the Jews of Germany?

 
Fonebone < Desmond Tutu speaks on collective punishment and home demolitions ---

" Israel is like Hitler and apartheid: Ive been deeply distressed in my visit to the Holy Land; it reminded me so much of what happened to us black people in South Africa... I have seen the humiliation of the Palestinians at checkpoints and roadblocks, suffering like us when young white police officers prevented us from moving about... I say why are our memories so short? Have our Jewish sisters and brothers forgotten their humiliation? Have they forgotten the collective punishment, the home demolitions, in their own history so soon?... The Apartheid government was very powerful, but we said to them: Watch it! If you flout the laws of this universe, youre going to bite the dust! (applause) Hitler was powerful. Mussolini was powerful. Stalin was powerful. Idi Amin was powerful. Pinochet was powerful. The Apartheid government were powerful. Milosevic was powerful. But, this is Gods world. A lie, injustice, oppression, those will never prevail in the world of this God. That is what we told our people. And we used to say: those ones, they have already lost, they are, they are going to bite the dust one day. We may not be around. An unjust Israeli government, however, powerful will fall in the world of this kind of God." __Desmond Tutu

Fonebone < look up the word "racist " in a grown up dictionary and
we can discuss the subject intelligently, Bic ?
 
 
 
it seems like these days, conspiracy theorists will dismiss ANY and EVERY terrorist attack by either an actual Islamist organization or even just an extremist-Muslim lone wolf, as a false-flag CIA op.

do they believe that Islamic extremism even exists? do they believe that 100% of Muslims around the world are peaceful and believe in cotton candy and sugarplums?

 
I would have to say that no, they don't think Islamic extremism exists.

If an Islamic extremist is caught doing something suspicious, they say they're a patsy, or a shill.

Case in point:  http://www.freedomcrowsnest.org/foru...ic.php?t=82962  (The writer of the OP is a truther, as are, I think, all of them.)
 
 
I pressed a Truther on this question many months back and he believed that the most any Muslim would do in terms of protest would be maybe marching in front of an embassy or (IIRC) at worst setting himself on fire, but never anything more violent than that.  
 
 
 
what does their clothes have to do with anything?

I smell bigotry.

JMH423- what is your opinion of the Nazi expulsion and terrorization of the Jews of Germany?

 
I really think their garb and ZZ Top beards look silly in this day and age, just like the KKK garb with or without the hoods....The Nazi deportation and terrorization of the Jews, Gypsys, and others of Germany and other nations was racist genocidal mania. The same type of racist idiocy is happening in Palistine as we speak. I am against all racism and discrimination. Thanks
 
 
 
Wolfowitz and Perle are both Jewish anyway, so why is it so surprising that they would want to support Israel? I still don't see where the lubavitchers really come into it. Maybe they do have friends in Washington who have similar ideals, so what? You not liking American foreign policy doesn't equate to there being a kabbalist conspiracy. There are Islamic states that wish to destroy Israel (i.e. Iran), so why should people stand by and do nothing?

Gaza is an issue fair enough, but that's not all down to the Israelis, seeing as it's chock full of islamic militants who oppose the very idea of the Israeli state.

 
It is not surprising that rabid zionists like Perle and Wolfowitz would want to support Israel. What is surprising is that two dubious characters like this would ever gain the security clearance to get antwhere near the pentagon. Their loyalty is obviously to a foreign power. The same is obviously true of Rahm Immanuel and countless others. You underestimate the power of the lubavitchers who are seen as moral leaders by these zionists.

They're not Lubavitchers. Just because you keep repeating it doesn't make it so. Why can't you just say that you don't like the fact that a lobby of zionist right wingers (not all jews by the way) and zionist Jewish American politicians are aiding the oppression of the palestinians by their lobbying to give financial and military support to Israel? Why are you incapable of having a political opinion without there being a shadowy, ancient sect of religious Jews manipulating things behind closed doors. I'll tell you why; because you obviously don't like Jews and you're trying to criminalize a perfectly legal activity - lobbying. To you, they must be crooked because they're Jews. You can't conceive of Jewish involvement in something without it being corrupt. Did you watch the video? I guess not.

Why are Perle and Wolfowitz dubious characters? I'm by no means fans of theirs, but I'd like to see any evidence that they should be denied security clearence to anywhere.

yup. no anti-Semitism here.  

JMH423- have you ever met a Jew that you DIDN'T hate?
 
 
 
That was not my argument at all. My position is as it has always been that the 911 attacks had little to do with Muslim extremism and everything to do with US, British, and Israeli imperialism. The evidence shows that certain sectors of Islamic nations such as Saudi Arabian and Pakistani intel ops were involved in the attacks. The so called extremists, al Queda have always been and still are CIA lackeys...I am not in favor of any terrorism or war crimes regardless of who is behind them. Bush=Clinton=Bush=Obama....all whores to the power brokers in NY London and Tel-Aviv...

Parky, I have met and I know many Jewish people and I don't hate any of them. I don't even hate traitorous Zionists like Rahm, Perle, Wolfowitz et al. They are just doing their jobs, however ill concieved their beliefs and motives are. I am simply aware of their agenda as agents for international zionism. As I have previously stated I am PRO Semitic as I support the semitic peoples of Palistine who have been invaded by the Khazarian terrorist war mongers and systematically purged from their land and ripped away from their culture. I think that there is an extreme conflict of interest problem with the above mentioned zio-agents being involved in any US governmental activity. Constitutionally, the US is the exact opposite of what these zionists believe in and stand for. Thanks

Evidence....................................?

 
There is ample eidence contained in governmental documents of both before and after the false flag terror attacks of 911 and the subsequent fraudulant "War On Terror" that had been called for decades earlier by US, British and Israeli zionists. Research Christopher Story's take on 911 and world events in general for the past 20-30 years. That would be a good start. Good luck in your search for the truth. That's what this life is really all about. Thanks

Here we are in familiar CT territory again...I've read plenty about 911, terrorism, false flags and all the rest of it. I'm not disagreeing with you because I haven't read the appropriate (in your eyes at least) material, I'm disagreeing with you because what your saying is wrong. Typical arroganrt CT logic - "You don't know the bigger picture, that's why you're disagreeing, you need to open yours eyes and read this..." Al queda are not CIA lackeys for starters; that's just a disgustingly simplified buzz phrase bandied about on the net to explain an extremely complex subject. Just addressing that on it's own would take a whole thread.

There is also not a shred of evidence that 911 was an inside job, and that it wasn't done by extremist muslims.

Obviously I am stating my opinion.....

Here is one example:

"Richard Perle is a traitor. There's no other way to put it."

Seymour Hersh (Jewish American Patriot) and what has become a rarity in America these days -- an INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST.........

Why would the most credible journalist of our times say this?????
Do some research on Perle, Wolfowotz, Zakheim, Feith, and the others I have mentioned....You'll get the gist. I can't do all your research for you mate.

I don't know, and neither do you...Perhaps he ********** his wife... Or perhaps it was just a personal opinion, based on the fact he disagreed with his political stance. You might want to look at Seymour Hersh's Kennedy book, which he also makes some unsubstantiated claims based purely on rumour. Just because Mr Hersh calls himself an investigative journalist, doesn't mean he's any good at it.

The fact that the 911 attacks took place at all is evidence that it was an "inside job" considering the targets and the non response...Nothing that precise, costly, and complicated could be pulled off without the help of US traitors. You are misinterperting the available information, and taking for fact deception and disinformation. It's OK, could happen to anyone who misplaces his trust in paid liars. Thanks

JMH423- do you believe that members of the 6 million strong Jewish-American community should be allowed to have jobs in the Federal govt? or should we be limited to money lending?

 
I believe that ANY of the 6 million Jewish Americans should be allowed to have any job in the country including President. However I don't believe that anyone involved with a foreign government's defense policy should be allowed to participate in high level securuty clearence US military positions thereafter. Also I believe that any dual citizens should be excluded for obvious conflict of interest reasons. People have been stripped of their US citizenship for simply voting in a foreign election. Perle, Feith, (convicted felon) Abrahams and others were directly involved in a project for "Securing The Realm" under Sharon in Israel before going on to write the PNAC documents that led to 911 and the bloody "War On Terror" debaucle that is costing trillions and killing millions. THEY ARE TRAITORS....As are those who helped them ooze into positions of power, Thanks
 
 
"When Perle was working for Senator Scoop Jackson, he was investigated by the Justice Department and found to have violated US policies relating to unlawful transmission of sensitive classified US information to Israel.

"An FBI summary of a 1970 wiretap recorded Perle discussing classified information with someone at the Israeli embassy," writes Paul Findley (They Dare To Speak Out, Chicago, Ill, Lawrence Hill Books 1989)."He came under fire in 1983 when newspapers reported he received substantial payments to represent the interests of an Israeli weapons company. Perle denied conflict of interest, insisting that, although he received payment for these services after he had assumed his position in the Defense Department, he was between government jobs when he worked for the Israeli firm."

In other words, Richard Perle is an Israeli spy.

What the **** is a guy like this doing ANYWHERE NEAR a US military installation??? Call homeland security!!!

what about Lubavitch Chassidim? what about Jews who have relatives and/or friends who are Lubavitch?

should we do a thorough cleansing of all Lubavitch related Jews from the nation?

u know what? forget it. I'm tired of this bigotry. welcome to permanent ignore.

So the guy was up to no good apparently (sources - What co.? When?) Now prove his part in 911. Prove he's a Lubavitcher. I find the U.S's aid to Israel during the occupation more than questionable, but please; provide evidence of any illegal activity, and/or Lubavitch involvement by specific people. Otherwise it's just disagreeable politics.

You're really beginning to piss me off now I 'll admit it...Is anything you say ever going to be backed up by fact?!!! Give me one 911 fact that I'm "misinterpreting". I havn't even said anything whatsoever about any detail of 911, yet you're already telling me I've got it wrong. There's a million dollar challenge on this forum...Why don't you enter seeing as you're obviously psychic.

I've also already said I don't automatically trust the government; trust should be earned, not given without question. But that's what you're asking of us on here who disagree with you...You're making outlandish statements with nothing to back them up.

THE TOP 40
REASONS TO DOUBT THE OFFICIAL STORY OF SEPTEMBER 11th, 2001

"We are continuing to compile the best documentation links for every single point on this page, and intend to post the updated version as soon as possible, and create teaching tools and more from the info. This is a significant and time-consuming process--if you have useful links, please send them to janice[at]911truth[dot]org. Thanks for your help!
If you use the search function with title key words, you will discover that 911Truth.org is home to articles backing virtually every point made below. Much of the basic research is available at the Complete 9/11 Timeline (hosted by cooperativeresearch.org), the 9/11 Reading Room (911readingroom.org), and the NY Attorney General Spitzer petition and complaint (Justicefor911.org). For physical evidence discussion, see Point 7.

THE DAY ITSELF - EVIDENCE OF COMPLICITY

1) AWOL Chain of Command
a. It is well documented that the officials topping the chain of command for response to a domestic attack - George W. Bush, Donald Rumsfeld, Richard Myers, Montague Winfield - all found reason to do something else during the actual attacks, other than assuming their duties as decision-makers.
b. Who was actually in charge? Dick Cheney, Richard Clarke, Norman Mineta and the 9/11 Commission directly conflict in their accounts of top-level response to the unfolding events, such that several (or all) of them must be lying.
2) Air Defense Failures
a. The US air defense system failed to follow standard procedures for responding to diverted passenger flights.
b. Timelines: The various responsible agencies - NORAD, FAA, Pentagon, USAF, as well as the 9/11 Commission - gave radically different explanations for the failure (in some cases upheld for years), such that several officials must have lied; but none were held accountable.
c. Was there an air defense standdown?

3) Pentagon Strike
How was it possible the Pentagon was hit 1 hour and 20 minutes after the attacks began? Why was there no response from Andrews Air Force Base, just 10 miles away and home to Air National Guard units charged with defending the skies above the nation''s capital? How did Hani Hanjour, a man who failed as a Cessna pilot on his first flight in a Boeing, execute a difficult aerobatic maneuver to strike the Pentagon? Why did the attack strike the just-renovated side, which was largely empty and opposite from the high command?

4) Wargames
a. US military and other authorities planned or actually rehearsed defensive response to all elements of the 9/11 scenario during the year prior to the attack - including multiple hijackings, suicide crashbombings, and a strike on the Pentagon.
b. The multiple military wargames planned long in advance and held on the morning of September 11th included scenarios of a domestic air crisis, a plane crashing into a government building, and a large-scale emergency in New York. If this was only an incredible series of coincidences, why did the official investigations avoid the issue? There is evidence that the wargames created confusion as to whether the unfolding events were "real world or exercise." Did wargames serve as the cover for air defense sabotage, and/or the execution of an "inside job"?

and on and on......

How did Hani Hanjour, a man who failed as a Cessna pilot on his first flight in a Boeing, execute a difficult aerobatic maneuver to strike the Pentagon? Why did the attack strike the just-renovated side, which was largely empty and opposite from the high command?

4) Wargames
a. US military and other authorities planned or actually rehearsed defensive response to all elements of the 9/11 scenario during the year prior to the attack - including multiple hijackings, suicide crashbombings, and a strike on the Pentagon.
b. The multiple military wargames planned long in advance and held on the morning of September 11th included scenarios of a domestic air crisis, a plane crashing into a government building, and a large-scale emergency in New York. If this was only an incredible series of coincidences, why did the official investigations avoid the issue? There is evidence that the wargames created confusion as to whether the unfolding events were "real world or exercise." Did wargames serve as the cover for air defense sabotage, and/or the execution of an "inside job"?

and on and on......

 
Do you believe that General McArthur was complicit in the Japanese attack on the Phillipines? I ask because his knowledge of the impending attack was much more immediate than what the Bush administration had on the 9/11 attacks, and yet he was caught completely off guard. He KNEW the Japanese were coming, he knew WHERE they were coming from, and he knew approximately WHEN they were coming, and his planes were still all caught on the ground by Japanese bombers.

Sometimes, despite our best efforts, we don't get the results we want. And sometimes people just don't put out their best efforts.

Welcome to the Real World.
 
 
 
Very nice...do you believe any Muslim-extremist terror attacks are real? If not, then why not?

 
First post on this thread (#6) by jmh423:

"I believe that there are definitely extremist fundementalist Muslims that have been involved in terrorist acts for decades......The same can be said of some fundementalist Christians in the US....Are you aware that there are also Jewish Zionist extremists supported and funded by the US and the State of Israel that are responsible for numerous acts of terrorism and espionage throughout the world since before the State Of Israel existed? Some of these arrogant maniacs actually believe that just by being Jewish they are chosen by God to reign over others, much like Nazis and KKK members. Also they have a large nuclear arsenal. Quite alarming, I'd say..."

Oh, sorry.

Your position on Muslim extremists was overshadowed by your rampant anti-Semitism in this post, but it's indeed there.

Oh, sorry.

Your position on Muslim extremists was overshadowed by your rampant anti-Semitism in this post, but it's indeed there.

 
I see.......Posting negative material about Arabs or Muslims in general is as American as apple pie. Even Hitleresque hatespeech like Medved or Prager spew daily is acceptable...Pointing out anything negative about Israel, Zionsm or anything where Jews are involved is branded "anti-semitic"....That seems to be an ongoing theme among the debunking set....Watch this little gem..

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qbKypqXADk 

Just a couple days ago on national TV, zionist Ben Stein calls Ron Paul an anti-semite for questioning idiotic US foreign policy....Paul doesn't even refer to Jews or Israel...Stein just pukes it out as if by gag reflex..ANTI_SEMITE..... Like Uncle Leo on Seinfeld. PRICELESS!!!

No, but I bet MacArthur would have held the Philipines if the Japanese would have come at him with four airliners and a case of boxcutters. Pretty silly analogy sport.

Since everyone here is very familiar with the PNAC documents, having read them years ago, it might be more helpful for you to share your thoughts on how you think they are enlightening.
 
 
the PNAC documents show how the Lubavitcher vampire Zionists plan on taking over the Earth and using Christian blood for Passover Matzohs.

 
 
 
I'm guessing the "...catalysing and catastrophic event - Like a new Pearl Harbour" quote is about to be unleashed.

THE DAY ITSELF - EVIDENCE OF COMPLICITY

1) AWOL Chain of Command
a. It is well documented that the officials topping the chain of command for response to a domestic attack - George W. Bush, Donald Rumsfeld, Richard Myers, Montague Winfield - all found reason to do something else during the actual attacks, other than assuming their duties as decision-makers.
b. Who was actually in charge? Dick Cheney, Richard Clarke, Norman Mineta and the 9/11 Commission directly conflict in their accounts of top-level response to the unfolding events, such that several (or all) of them must be lying.
2) Air Defense Failures
a. The US air defense system failed to follow standard procedures for responding to diverted passenger flights.
b. Timelines: The various responsible agencies - NORAD, FAA, Pentagon, USAF, as well as the 9/11 Commission - gave radically different explanations for the failure (in some cases upheld for years), such that several officials must have lied; but none were held accountable.
c. Was there an air defense standdown?

3) Pentagon Strike
How was it possible the Pentagon was hit 1 hour and 20 minutes after the attacks began? Why was there no response from Andrews Air Force Base, just 10 miles away and home to Air National Guard units charged with defending the skies above the nation''s capital? How did Hani Hanjour, a man who failed as a Cessna pilot on his first flight in a Boeing, execute a difficult aerobatic maneuver to strike the Pentagon? Why did the attack strike the just-renovated side, which was largely empty and opposite from the high command?

4) Wargames
a. US military and other authorities planned or actually rehearsed defensive response to all elements of the 9/11 scenario during the year prior to the attack - including multiple hijackings, suicide crashbombings, and a strike on the Pentagon.
b. The multiple military wargames planned long in advance and held on the morning of September 11th included scenarios of a domestic air crisis, a plane crashing into a government building, and a large-scale emergency in New York.

There is evidence that the wargames created confusion as to whether the unfolding events were "real world or exercise." Did wargames serve as the cover for air defense sabotage, and/or the execution of an "inside job"?

and on and on......

 
All irrelevent to the point at hand. Although not irrelevent to rethinking the U.S' security strategies; something clearly went awry. However, none of it is evidence of an inside job.
 
 
At times I think the 9/11 Kooks are just recycling some of the Pearl Harbor Conspiracy theories.

Read the "PNAC" documents and the Israeli think tank documents regarding "Securing The Realm". Note who some of the authors were, the positions they held and who they were working for during both timelines. Being critical thinking skeptics as you all are, can you draw any possible conclusions that would lead one to believe that some of these people might be involved in a politically motivated false flag terror attack that would facilitate EXACTLY what they wanted on many levels? Then add the FACT that at least one of the main authors of both documents had previously been found to be passing classified documents to a foreign government while working for the US DOD and not only wasn't prosecuted but was welcomed back into the highest levels of the DOD right before the attacks. Also a Vice President and signee to PNAC who was CEO of a major military contracting firm (even though he never worked a day in his life in such a bussiness) and held major stock in this company upon his retirement to become VP of the US. These facts and many others lead me to believe that some of these people were involved in the 911 attacks. Thanks

Rather than having us read this stuff yet again, why don't you do a forum search for the endless discussions we've been having on this topic for the last four years or so. Then let us know if we've missed anything.

None of this proves anything. You just think it does because of your bias. Same as the cut n paste job earlier a few posts back about chain of command/air defence etc. - Most of which was wrong anyway. The air defence thing is complete rubbish for starters.

I will stipulate that you and the debunking crew here at JREF have probably overcooked all of these assertions with the classic CIA "plauseable deniability" tactics at length and they may even be somewhat plauseable. Let's just say that we disagree about what can be ascertained from this and much other information regarding 911. Nothing personal mate.

I don't know if you are aware of this or not, but cases can not be "proved" here on the net. I didn't say that I have proved anything, however I think that there is ample evidence of foul play by US officials and other foreign entities other than the ridiculous mysterious Al Kader boogeymen scenario that has been fed to the ignorant masses. I am certain that a true investigation into this debaucle would turn up much of what I have alleged and a lot more. There have not even been witnesses who have testified under oath before a criminal grand jury as of yet 8+ years later. Don't you find that strange?

You'll have to help me out here; let's take Dick Cheney...What did he do? Edit: And how is it tied to 911 being an inside job?

O.K, so you don't want to be specific on any issue. Spoken like a true CTist. You've not addressed one single point in any depth in this entire thread, and you call me dense for wanting to do so.

If he were, you wouldn't have to ask.

 
NO, I don't. Wrong again champ....If he were a Jr NSA informant, why wouldn't I have to ask? That certainly doesn't make ANY sense.

On that note, I'll be taking my leave of you now, returning every so often to look in but not to post. You proved yourself very trollworthy tonight and as such I have little use for you.

You remind me very much of another poster here who goes by the handle 'Galileo'. You two are of a kind. See ya around, Skippy.

That's the best you can do, Mack? I make a point while having a little fun your penchant for tossing out the condesending nicknames, G-slice, and that's your response? A series of incoherent insults?

Well, Tough Guy, I'm not gonna do this little dance with you. We are skeptics here, Babalooee. That means we go where the evidence takes us. You have had ample opportunities to present that evidence and sway us, DJ Jazzy Jeff. But because to the sheer amount of evidence you have against you in regards to 9/11, Bootyliscous, you have a very steep slope ahead of you. And all the whining and insults in the world aren't gonna smooth that out for ya, Gumba.
 
 
 
the attack in the King David Hotel was not a false-flag attack. the Irgun claimed responsibility for it and Israelis honor the attack till this day.

the 1993 WTC bombing was done by Muslim extremists. they were found guilty in a court of law. do you respect America's justice system?

welcome to the forum. I'm sure your stay will be short.

 
respect americas justice system, oh dear. I know the loons around here that pass themselves of as skeptics think america can do no wrong but really, come on, no really, i mean do the words Guantanamo Bay mean anything. Oh sorry i was forgetting it's ok to take people, lock em up torture em for years if they're accused of killing americans since we all know that americans are worth more than anybody else. I look forward to the american troops who killed 9 children the other day being brought to account, oops silly me, dead arabs don't count, do they ?

You have no idea what you are talking about, do ya, Buddy? You are posting like a monkey playing chess, Spinache Chin, just moving the pieces around in hopes you win. Even when you try to make fun of someone, it's like you've seen people do this before, Snuffleuphagus, but can't quite grasp the concept.

Anyway, Gulliver, since you seem to be in the midst of a meltdown, having dropped the subject of Muslim Terrorism in favor of lame personal attacks, I'll leave ya to it.

Good Luck, Charlie!

You seem like a reasonably intelligent chap. It is hard for me to believe that you really buy the story of Osama Ben Laden and the 19 Dwarves....Are you really on the level here?

 
Tell me why I shouldn't. Give me one "specific" (if you know what the word means) piece of evidence that goes against the official story. Why do you think BIn Laden wasn't behind it? Why do you think the 19 terrorists are innocent?

And yes, I would like to think I have a reasonable level of intelligence, that's why I don't believe in conspiracy theories. I don't get carried away by knee jerk leftist reactions to a government I don't particularly like and believe they commited atrocities they didn't. There have been one or two moral blackspots in the administration, but I'd like to see anything that supports the notion of them murdering 3000 American citizens. Which brings me to another point on the subject of terror attacks/flase flags; do you actually believe that with the amount of hatred the Bush Administration stirred up, some notable opponent of theirs wouldn't have backed up the flase flag theory given the first opportunity? Take Noam Chomsky for instance who said the idea was "extremely unlikely"., or Ron Paul who blamed U.S foreign policy for "them attacking us" It's funny how all of the Bush admin's critics all back up the official story. And why do they do this? Because there's no evidence to the contrary. It's funny how thousands and thousands of experts from the political world, science, business - wherever...Almost everyone of any worth won't give these theories the time of day.

The "case" - using the term extremely loosely - for 911 being an inside job is based on a chain of nonsensical crap, connected by non existent links. And this is why I would like to look at one issue at a time, and demonstrate that it's either not valid or has no bearing on the issue at hand. I'm pretty confident any point you bring up has been manipulated by the truth movement, been erroneously quoted as fact when it's not, is an out and out lie or has no connection to 911.

I am on the level, yes...Are you? You're the one refusing to look at any of point of your position in detail then making out I'm not "on the level". If you are "on the level" why don't you open the books as it were. You're one of the people I should imagine who is demanding a 911 investigation? why can't we have a 911 investigation of our own surrounding your accusations? You're screaming about cover ups and secrecy and doing pretty much the same thing here. This is a skeptics forum, and you seem to think we're unreasonable for being skeptical..? Why did you come here if not to debate your point? Just to try and spread your propaganda? If so, wrong forum.

SO, I ask you again, what was Dick Cheney's part in the cover-up/false flag? And why should I believe Bin Laden & the "19 dwarves" are innocent?

It's strange that you're quite willing to accept political gain as a motive for the Bush/Cheney gang, and yet not for Bin Laden and his minions and benefactors. Interesting.

Is a knee jerk leftist reaction more dangerous than a knee jerk rightist reaction? How about kneejerk centrists? Should we also watch for them? Please give me a proper definition of "specific", oh wise one. Come on, what are you? A second year student at a Junior College in Poli-Sci? You seem to know all the silly buzz words. Are you a fan of Chris Matthews? I think he is a classic example of a knee jerk moderate liberal fascist. He has spent the last week railing about how we should deal with underwear bombers. It seems to be his opinion that we should make our country more like Israel in terms of looking up everyones ass before they travel more than 100 miles, and that America as we knew it is a thing of the past. You are onto something with this "knee jerk" concept.

In my opinion the "minions and benefactors" of the "Bush/Cheney gang" are the same as those of Bin Laden & the 19 Dwarves. They are all on the same team. Wasn't old man Bush cutting some kind of military contracting deal with OBLs brother as we were being attacked? As a "skeptic", doesn't that make you wonder? Hmmmmm...

More irrelevant posting and question dodging. Specific is the opposite of what you're doing. Making vague statements and avoiding any of the details in your argument. Do you want to start from your last question instead?

 
Wasn't old man Bush cutting some kind of military contracting deal with OBLs brother as we were being attacked?

 
Please be specific! If you mean the Carlyle/SBG meeting, no he wasn't in the meeting "as we were being attacked" it was the day before, neither was he in the meeting with Shafiq bin Laden as that was the day after and he didn't attend. And why shouldn't he be in a meeting? The Bin Laden's are major players in the middle east business world and the Carlyle Group has interests there. Also, can you verify in any way it was a military contracting deal? Or that it had anything SPECIFICALLY to do with Bush Sr? Defence contracting is not what the Carlyle Group does primarily (not that it matters all that much), and the Bush's are one of many investors. Please tell me why this is so wrong and what bearing it has on 911.

And yes, all knee jerk reactions are usually a bad thing, not just the leftist variety. And no I won't be giving you any definition of specific as we both know damn well what it means. Your entire belief in the 911=inside job relies on your complete disregard for detail.

I'll ignore the rest of your post seeing as it's a rant about some guy i've never heard of and is completely irrelevant. "Thanks".
 
 
[quote=Rogue1stclass;5464375 The "cover story", Homes, has a metric buttload of evidence supporting it.[/QUOTE]

Red

I think that your cohort here nailed it! The "evidence" presented by the officials directly after these attacks smells worse and worse the more you are exposed to it. Rogue1stclass was dead on, although I would term it more of a pantload...The Atta suitcase with the official terror handbook, the pristine passport, the official red Al Kader terrorfascist bandana in Shanksville, Cheney sitting there and letting a missile hit the Pentagon, Bush-Bin Laden connections, the plan for the Afghan invasion finalized a day or two before the attacks, the FEMA drill set up months before, less than a mile from ground zero....One by one they are just farts...But when you add it all up it comes out to something that can only be measured in as Rogue so eloquently stated "metric buttloads"....The whole thing reminds me of an episode of the great old '70s detecvtive show Columbo. It would always start with an open and shut case against someone who was set up for the murder...But Columbo always smelled something rotten and it ususally turned out that the one planting the evidence and pointing to someone else ended up being the "very feller"....As GW Bush said:"You can fool some of the people ALL the time. Let's keep working on them...Don't be one of them. Use your head mate.

You didn't explain the difference between "Leftist kneejerk and Rightist kneejerk reactions"....What's that all about? Stalin was the picture boy for leftists and Hitler and Mussolini were for rightists? The answer is....There is no difference mate. It is just the way the elite divide the ignorant masses with meaningless garbage while both sides are working for more governmental control for the same cabal no matter who wins. Quit exposing yourself as a dupe of the Hegalian propagandists and rise above the metric buttloads of crap you have been wallowing in your whole life.

Forget I said it. It was a knee jerk reaction! I don't have time to look into your last post, but at a glance i'll just say that finding bits of the hijackers' clothing isn't strange at all...They found clothing, paperwork...allsorts of stuff...The only reason why the hijacker's stuff stands out is because it belongs to the hijackers. Debris of all kinds was spread all over the crash sites, both NY. and Washington. Why is it strange that some of it was found?
 
 
To get back on topic, Zuit Suit, why don't you name some terrorist attacks that were actually done by Muslims. We get that you don't think 9/11 was, but there is whole subforum dedicated to that, Melvin. Feel free to continue that discussion over there, Cool Cat.

I'll make it easy for ya, John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown Band, name which of the following was actually done by Muslim Terrorist and which were "false flags".

The Beirut car bombings.
The Lockerby plane bombing.
The WTC bombing.
The Embasy bombings in Africa.
OKC (this one's tricky)
The USS Cole bombings.
The cartoon riots.
The Madrid bombings.
The 7/7 London bombings.
The Christmas airplane bombing.

You can do that for us, can't ya, Dawg?

Excerpt from Article:
When armed agents from the Mossad, Israel s spy agency, infiltrated the North African city of Tunis in 1988 to kill Abu Jihad, 51, Yasser Arafat's PLO deputy commander, "they employed up to 4,000 men for his assassination," wrote Robert Fisk in The Independent on April 13, 2001. Led by former Prime Minister and then-deputy military chief Ehud Barak, who waited in a warship off-shore, a Mossad death squad killed Abu Jihad's driver, a gardener, then his bodyguard. His son remembers how "four men stepped forward to empty an entire clip of bullets from an automatic weapon into my dad--like it was a kind of ritual. Then an officer in a black mask stepped forward and shot him in the head, just to make sure."

Noted Fisk, "Today, Israel's murder squads come cheaper: a computer chip that activates a bomb in a mobile telephone, a family collaborator, or even a splash of ultra-violet paint on the roof of a car to alert an Israeli Apache helicopter pilot to fire a Hellfire missile into the Palestinian's vehicle."

Nice guys eh!!

Hey Parky, who do you think has more spies monitoring US governmental installations, Israel or Al Kadar??? If it's Al, the Israelis must be real dip****s, because there have been hundreds of them caught right here since 911....Al Kader must be a genius because we can't even find Ben Laden after 9 years.....And he is sending Christmas bombs to Detroit in a Bank President's sons speedos....These Kaders are really sharp!!!

Intriguing....

Ever heard of these terms?

"Katya and Sayanin: A Katya is a Jewish spy. The Sayanin are those Jews resident in the host nation who provide support and assistance to the spies in their missions. In 1979 an ex-CIA official said "Mossad can go to any distinguished American Jew and ask for help." (9/3/1979, Newsweek) Were the 200 Israeli spies expelled after 9/11 the only spies they have in this country? If it were any other country and we caught 200 spies what would we have done? Why did the spy story only run on one network? Why did the spy story disappear from the Fox News website? As Jews make up about 2% of our population and blacks make up about 14% there should be 6 times as many black spies as there are Jewish spies wouldn't you think? I can't think of any black spies."
 
 
 
Got back to you in 5 minutes sport.....Were'd you go?

 
I had other things to do, Pilgrim, then sit around reading your paranoid fantasies 24/7.

I see from the list that you happen to believe that "Muslim wackos" are capable of ridiculous acts of violence, Cabage Patch, you just don't think they could have done any of the really bad ones. I wonder how that works. Yeah, they do bad things, just not this particular set of bad things.

Your answer on OKC, Buck-o, is intriguing to me. You see, Mister Man, Tim McVeigh was your One Guy. For all your talk about government oppression and such, Scooby, Tim McVeigh was the only person who actually had the guts to do something about it. He was the revolutionary all the current CTers want to be, Spongebob. If he is just patsy, then, well, you got nothin' but a bunch of big talkin' cowards spouting off online.

Though, Putintane, it is hillarious to me just how much you got wrong about OKC in your little blurb. I suppose that, lo these 15 years, the whole Clinton/Militia show down has become legend in CT circles, and as such has been bent around to fit their worldview.

For the record, I was a militia nut back in the day. The OKC bombing happened in response to Clinton's attacks on the Bill of Rights (via gun control) and heavy handed method's of dealing with anti-government groups, not allow them. I don't recall any "anti-terrorism bill", and in fact, post-OKC, Clinton pretty much abandoned those positions anyway. So, Partner, you got all that backwards.

as a former "militia nut" (congrats on coming back to the real-world, by the way), what do you think is the MAIN driving force behind the psychology of these people?

is it racism? insecurity? repressed homosexuality or other sexual issues? child abuse?

these are honest questions. ive always wanted to figure these guys out. and I'm pretty sure it has NOTHING to do with freedom, God, or guns.

In my day, it really was all about freedom and guns. From a certain perspective, it really did seem like Clinton was trying to disarm the country and really didn't care about how much blood had to spilled to do it. The militias originally were response to that. On the one hand, it was an attempt to claim exemption from disarmament because even a tight interpretation of the 2nd Amendment allowed for miltias to be armed. On the other hand, it was a protection against the type of force displayed at Waco and Ruby Ridge.

Neither purpose was particularly well thought out, really.

Racism in militias was mainly incidental. An organization that appeals to rural, white gun owners is going to draw it's share of racists. One of the more uncomfortable moments in my life was when my best friend, who is black, and I went into a gun shop that also sold Klan periphenalia. He, however, thought it was the funniest thing he'd ever seen in his life, and the staff at the shop was plenty friendly to him. It was a surreal experience.

The thing is, though, that none of the issues that drew relatively normal folks into militias 15 years ago are factors anymore. So I have to imagine that those who are still in them have to be hardcore CTers preparing for the coming of the NWO. I have to add that this wasn't a part of the militias when I was involved. There was some talk about Clinton eventually handing over our sovereignty to the UN, but those were the fringe nuts.

With all due respect, you're talking absolute bollocks again. debunker's handbooks, t.v nit wits, ad hominem attacks...When you feel ready, please answer at least one point I brought up addressing the evidence on which you base your view of false flag terror attacks - 911 in this case. You clearly don't know what you're talking about and this is getting extremely boring. You're just another CTist arguing from a point of ignorance and refusing to accept the fact.

Tell me, if you can, why it's so strange that a few bits of property belonging to the hijackers was found among thousands of other bits? In fact, explain why finding (or planting as you suggest) the passport is even important. Why would they need to find the passport? What bearing would it have on 911 overall?

Madrid-Post 911 Mossad- alCIAda joint op to get Spain into Iraq War

 
You got this one backwards, too. Spain was already in Iraq. The bombings convinced them to leave.

So, again, pretty much the opposite of what you claim.
 
 
I thought the Madrid bombings were a Zionist false-flag attack, to convince the Spanish to hate Muslims even more and stay in Iraq.

but of course, that backfired, due to the conflict between the Zio-Communists who wanted to instead blaim Basque seperatists, and Zio-fascists..who wanted to blaim the Muslims.

u see..the Jews are behind it all!!!!

 
 
 
 
Even if they are real, they were radicalized by the US government.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3LlA3ht55c  Alex Jones has the info!

 

 
Alex Jones SURE DOES have a lot of info about these guys.

where was AJ on 9-11?

 
As much as I enjoy participating in a good ol' nutter lynching, we should examine the claim before pulling the lever..

 http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp...nguage=printer 

You can find similar content from the Boston Globe, and quotes from some UN education functionary. So there is pretty good evidence the US did ship "radicalizing" pro-Taliban, anti-communist textbooks to Afghanistan during their antiRussion campaign.

Now it's a huge and highly tenuous (I'd say unsupportable) leap to claim that US funded textbooks are the originating cause of current Muslim extremism, but it's at least an arguable point and the premise condition is well supported by reliable news sources.

I find it strange that the denizens of this forum are only willing to pick on the total-screw-loose nutters - the Alex Jones, the birthers, the Obama-is-a-crypto-muslim ppl who seem together seem to be a tiny minority, almost powerless and politically isolated, yet ignore the less spectacular but more prevalent and powerful breeds of nutters. It's like picking on the town fool while ignoring the profoundly stupid town planning board.

Hey Parky, who do you think has more spies monitoring US governmental installations, Israel or Al Kadar??? If it's Al, the Israelis must be real dip****s, because there have been hundreds of them caught right here since 911....Al Kader must be a genius because we can't even find Ben Laden after 9 years.....And he is sending Christmas bombs to Detroit in a Bank President's sons speedos....These Kaders are really sharp!!!

Intriguing....

Ever heard of these terms?

"Katya and Sayanin: A Katya is a Jewish spy. The Sayanin are those Jews resident in the host nation who provide support and assistance to the spies in their missions. In 1979 an ex-CIA official said "Mossad can go to any distinguished American Jew and ask for help." (9/3/1979, Newsweek) Were the 200 Israeli spies expelled after 9/11 the only spies they have in this country? If it were any other country and we caught 200 spies what would we have done? Why did the spy story only run on one network? Why did the spy story disappear from the Fox News website? As Jews make up about 2% of our population and blacks make up about 14% there should be 6 times as many black spies as there are Jewish spies wouldn't you think? I can't think of any black spies."

 

Hmm, you somehow seem to be able to hold the two ideas
a) The Mossad manages to put a lot of false flag operations without the normal public noticing
b)The Mossad manages to get caught a lot of times
in your head at the same time. Don't they seem somewhat contradictory?  

Also: why does the Mossad need to monitor US agencies and installations if they already control the US?  
 
 
 
Hmmmm...?????

 
Indeed. I think that you are a little overdue to respond to  a post that got moved over here . Why not defend your sources, just once?
 
 
 
I thought the Madrid bombings were a Zionist false-flag attack, to convince the Spanish to hate Muslims even more and stay in Iraq.

but of course, that backfired, due to the conflict between the Zio-Communists who wanted to instead blaim Basque seperatists, and Zio-fascists..who wanted to blaim the Muslims.

u see..the Jews are behind it all!!!!

 

 
That's so crazy it has to be true!
 
 
 
Also: why does the Mossad need to monitor US agencies and installations if they already control the US?  

 
Good question.
 
 
 
Good question.

 
You'll have to ask those in control of the Israeli government...But the FACT is that the US is lousy with mossad spies and traitotous "Americans" who aid and abet them. In my opinion those who are involved, both foreigners and "Americans" should join Jonathan Pollard in jail....For the safety of all...That would be a great beginning for the real "war on terror". We need to start locking these thieves and murderers up and rid our country of this menace.

"Spies, Criminals, and Terrorists

What was behind that exchange between Jones and Powell?

Since the Alert report of the Israeli spy story, and the suspected links to Sept. 11, EIR has compiled evidence of a vast network of Israeli drug and diamond smugglers, spies, and communications intelligence operativesall working under Israeli, American and Canadian corporate covers, on behalf of the mafia-riddled Sharon government, and Sharon's international sponsors in the Mega Group and allied Anglo-American circles (See EIR, Aug. 31, 2001, "Mega Was Not An AgentMega Was the Boss;" and Nov. 16, 2001, "The `Mega-maniacs' Steering Sharon's Mideast War Drive").

A number of sources have confirmed earlier EIR investigative findings that this network is engaged in:

A massive ecstasy trafficking operation, delivering hundreds of millions of dollars in illegal drugs, manufactured in the Netherlands, to cities across the United States. The drug trafficking operation is also engaged in black market diamond smuggling, using Hassidic Jews as couriers.
Portions of the funds garnered from the illegal operations, according to sources, are funneled to offshore bank accounts of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. Some of these dirty funds were reportedly diverted to Sharon's election campaigns. This Israeli mafia apparatus receives technical support via a number of Israeli communications firms, that subcontract with major American telephone companies and government law enforcement agencies.
Spy operations, targeted at mosques and other centers of the Islamic-American communities. According to sources, the goal is to foment nominally "Arab" or "Islamic" labeled violence and terrorism inside the United States, to win Bush Administration support for an Israeli war against the Palestinians and Arabs. These sources believe further, Israeli-abetted terror attacks are to be expected.

Surveillance of U.S. government law enforcement, military and intelligence facilities, to gather profile information for such terrorist attacks, as well as espionage penetration. Organized teams of young, "recently retired" Israeli Defense Force soldiers, (go to any Westfield Mall and you'll be harassed by a cadre of them) often associated with specialty units engaged in electronic signal intercepts and explosive ordinance, have targeted at least 36 domestic U.S. military bases, and many federal law enforcement and intelligence installations. A second feature of this targeting of USG facilities is the recruitment of "a new generation of Jonathan Pollards" (Israeli spies)."
 
 
blah blah blah - more antisemitic tripe.

That just screams "fake quote" to me. No page number, no name for the "ex-CIA official" and it is footnoted exactly the same way on  all the hate websites . We eagerly await sources for the many quotes posted here lately.
 
 
No, no, no.

The real conspiracy is there are no Jews.

They were invented by the Romans 2000 years ago to justify their excursions into the Middle East and the myth was promolgated by the Catholics and Muslims as a scapegoat and excuse to butcher and torture people. "Jewish" money lenders throughout the medivel period were actually Jesuit priests who continued the lie (with special absolution) to keep money exchanges in the hands of the Church but remain blameless for it.

This practice continues to this very day. "Israel" is really a continuation of the Crusades run by a coalition of this same Jesuit order and Nazi and Soviet refugees pretending to be "Jews" in order to deflect blame from The Church. The United States government is, of course, in on it and funnels millions in military and monetary support to prop up the lie.

It's really pretty obvious when you think about it. Wake up, Sheeple!

You seem to share the views that were once expressed by a certain Austrian chap by the name of Hitler. I'd be a bit careful about that if I was you, because, you know, he came to a bad end.

Just an observation.

No, probably just the right time. This is the 3rd or 4th outright false quote from jmh423. I wish he could defend even one of them. He just copies and pastes lies from hate websites and acts like that makes it true. It's worse than parody.

I don't suppose someone could check on a 1996 Jewish Week article? (April 26) That would be nice to track down:

 
…If a Jew needs a liver, can you take the liver of an innocent non-Jew passing by to save him?
"The Torah would probably permit that. Jewish life has an infinite value,” he explained. “There is something infinitely more holy and unique about Jewish life than non-Jewish life.”

 
The man in question said something on that date, but no one can find an original.

These anti Jewish guys make me laugh...They're jumping up and down "guarding the gates" against the alleged "zionist agenda", meanwhile radical islam's walking straight in the back door.
 
 
Add "  U.S. Bankers Magazine  " or whatever to the list as well.

This isn't really any different than the many fake verses that have been attributed to the Talmud over the years.

Victor Ostrovsky spells it out in his own words-
Got any insulting or derisive things to say about Victor Ostrovsky ?
Anti-semetic, Anti-zionist,or jew-hater perhaps ?
In Victor Ostrovsky's book "By way of deception"
the network is a family of "little helpers" --A Sayanim
<excerpt>
The Mossad - believe it or not - has just 30 to 35 case officers, or katsas, operating in the world at any one time. The main reason for this extraordinary low total, as you will read in this book, is that unlike other countries, Israel can tap the significant and loyal cadre of the worldwide Jewish community outside Israel. This is done through a unique system of sayanim, volunteer Jewish helpers.

It takes a true woo like yourself to think that someone pointing out a source has no credibility and is known for posting flat out lies is an "insult." Of course, I guess when you embrace reasonless thinking...anything applying logic WOULD be an insult.

But nope - horrible choice yet again. You've just posted a site that has absolutely 0 credibility...anyone can post anything on there for any reason. No credibility, no references.

Do you just believe everything you read because it happens to agree with your fantasies? Its the woo mindset in action: if it says what I want to believe, it must be true!

Looks like the guy has been catering to the Anti-Jew crowd for the past ten years, publishing books (each less popular than the other) ever few years of the same flavor:
 http://www.amazon.com/Victor-Ostrovs..._athr_dp_pel_1 

Granted you linked to a book that at least (briefly) reached the bestseller list...but with 0 third party verification, I'm not sure what we are expected to do here. If your looking for evidence to support jew hatred, this is a pretty weak link.
 
 
The weird thing is that I read that Victor Ostrovsky book when I was in high school. It was completely random - a bestselling paperback on a grocery store shelf and I was bored, but there you go. For a while, it had me thinking.

Mossad-CIA Behind Christmas
Plane Bombing Attempt

The Mutallab Op - Same Ol' Christmas Spirit
By Leland Lehrman
1-2-10

Excerpt:

"We now have Marine combat veterans debunking the official propaganda
about the Christmas airline bombing attempt on established veteran websites. The cavalry's finally coming, can you hear the trumpets? The comments on the Veterans Today article linked below are vital.
An attack on Christmas and an excuse for further war and domestic tyranny was the main gig. But a key side deal here is probably getting the necessary permanent silence from Mutallab's father, who probably knows too much about Zionist Jew Mossad running Nigeria, Africa and the WORLD. He may have subtly indicated discomfort with something, probably the US/Saudi/Israeli proxy terror war against his wife's country, Yemen. The Yemeni wife may also be the target. She may know someone in Yemen and may have explained to Yemen who "Al Qaeda" in Yemen really is, which is why Yemen is now openly telling the world that "Al Qaeda" is really ISRAELI."

JUST THE FACTS:

Let's review what we know thus far:

* Our terrorist traveled to Yemen to meet with terrorists there

* The terrorists in Yemen had been in Guantanamo but had been ordered released by the Bush Administration though they were, perhaps the most dangerous detainees held

* The government of Yemen tells us that Islamic terrorists there have been arrested who have proven ties to Israeli intelligence

* Our terrorists father, though we are told is a retired "Nigerian banker" actually ran their defense industry in close cooperation with Israeli Intelligence (Mossad)

* Our terrorist's visa to the US was never with withdrawn, though he was on a "terrorist watchlist"

* Our terrorist, though flying from Nigeria, entered the Netherlands without passing thru customs, something impossible to do without assistance from an intelligence agency

* Our terrorist, while at the Amsterdam airport, was being assisted by a man appearing to be Indian, who claimed our Nigerian terrorist was a Sudanese refugee with no passport (no passport was used entering the EU, something technically impossible)

* However, Dutch authorities, the same ones who confirmed he entered the country with no passport also confirmed he had a valid US visa, though on a terrorist watch list that is shared with Dutch authorities.

* Airport security in Amsterdam is contracted to an Israeli controlled company with, not only the most sophisticated technologies, but, in fact, the company that had developed the concept of security profiling.

* The parallels between this case and the Richard Reid "shoe bomber" case are much more than admitted."

You gotta love it!! The truth is a beautiful thing....
 
 
 
But a key side deal here is probably getting the necessary permanent silence from Mutallab's father, who probably knows too much about Zionist Jew Mossad running Nigeria, Africa and the WORLD.

 
no anti-Semitism here folks. it doesn't even exist. look away!!

No, you are welcome to prove that your quotes are real. Will you?

1 - Newsweek Magazine 9/3/1979 - please post page # and name of "ex-CIA official" for your quote. Or admit your source is a lie.
2 - Please provide a scan or source for "U.S. Bankers Magazine." Or "US Bankers Association Magazine." Or "The Bankers Manifesto of 1892." Or better yet, admit what you posted was a lie.
3 - Please provide a real source for the April 26, 1996 "Jewish Week" article. (Is that Jewish Week in NY?)

Then we will deal with the anti-semites at places like rense.com where you evidently get your (fake) information.

Carlitos, I do not have a copy of Newsweek 9-3-79. I posted an assertion from the source I cited. I believe it to be accurate, as I am confidant that Newsweek would be all up in arms over such a comment attributed to their publication being bandied about on the net on these so called "hate sites" and set the record straight. I'm sure that some of the uber researchers and critical thinking skeptics here at JREF could and probably have ascertained whether or not the quotation is real. NONE of you have come forward with proof of that it IS a lie. WHY NOT? If I get around to finding and scanning the article referred to, I will. But your ploy: "Post the page number, and name the ex CIA agent or it is a lie", is not valid. As I told parky a while ago, it is either there or it is not...I would bet money that the article is in that copy of Newsweek, and that a former CIA agent was quoted.

As far as the Ginsburgh qoute in the 4-26-96 edition of the New York Jewish Week, again I do not have a copy handy but one of the other gentlemen here found some reference to the edition and ascertained that Ginsburgh had written an article in that edition. I find it interesting that 10 years later a New Jersey Rabbi dressed up much like Ginsburgh was arrested for dealing in illegal human body parts trading and a Sweedish journalist wrote a story about Israelis hacking out the organs of murdered Palistinians for resale. Priceless!! Again, I'd bet money that the quote I posted is accurate, especially after reading some more pearls of hatred and racist supremacy spewed by this raving lunitic. Here is another piece that refers to Rabbi Ginsburgh and some more of his holy thoughts:

 http://www.rebelnews.org/books/zioni...-at-the-mosque 

As to the several quotes regarding the Bankers that were made in Congressional hearings by Lindburgh, McFadden, and others, I believe them to be true considering the impeccable character of these men....

Popular Rabbis Comments on Treatment of Arabs Show a Different Side of Chabad
By Nathaniel Popper
Published June 03, 2009, issue of June 12, 2009.

"Like the best Chabad-Lubavitch rabbis, Manis Friedman has won the hearts of many unaffiliated Jews with his charismatic talks about love and God; it was Friedman who helped lead Bob Dylan into a relationship with Chabad.

But Friedman, who today travels the country as a Chabad speaker, showed a less warm and cuddly side when he was asked how he thinks Jews should treat their Arab neighbors.

The only way to fight a moral war is the Jewish way: Destroy their holy sites. Kill men, women and children (and cattle), Friedman wrote in response to the question posed by Moment Magazine for its Ask the Rabbis feature."

This is from another anti-semitic hate site...no doubt...The Jewish Daily Forward....Thanks for starting this thread.

Jewish Fundamentalism in Israel
By Israel Shahak and Norton Mezvinsky. London:Pluto Press,1999, 176 pp.List: $18.95; AET: $16.00

Reviewed by Allan C. Brownfeld

"The difference between a Jewish and a non-Jewish person stems from the common expression: Let us differentiate. Thus, we do not have a case of profound change in which a person is merely on a superior level. Rather, we have a case of let us differentiate between totally different species. This is what needs to be said about the body: the body of a Jewish person is of a totally different quality from the body of [members] of all nations of the worldAn even greater difference exists in regard to the soul. Two contrary types of soul exist, a non-Jewish soul comes from three satanic spheres, while the Jewish soul stems from holiness.

We therefore ask: Why should a non-Jew be punished if he kills even a non-Jewish embryo while a Jew should not be punished even if he kills a Jewish embryo? The answer can be understood by [considering] the general difference between Jews and non-Jews: A Jew was not created as a means for some [other] purpose; he himself is the purpose, since the substance of all divine emanations was created only to serve the Jews.

You are nit picking sporto....Either version, one or the other could have been slightly changed in translation....Both are equally disgusting...Here's another from the same article written by the same two Jewish Scholars, Israel Shahak and Norton Mezvinsky:

"Rabbi Yitzhak Ginsburgh, who wrote a chapter of a book in praise of (terrorist and cold blooded murderer) Baruch Goldstein and what he did, is another member of this group. An immigrant to Israel from the U.S., Rabbi Ginsburgh speaks freely of Jews genetic-based, spiritual superiority over non-Jews. If you saw two people drowning, a Jew and a non-Jew, the Torah says you save the Jewish life first, Ginsburgh states. If every simple cell in a Jewish body entails divinity, is a part of God, then every strand of DNA is part of God. Therefore, something is special about Jewish DNAIf a Jew needs a liver, can you take the liver of an innocent non-Jew passing by to save him? The Torah would probably permit that. Jewish life has an infinite value.

This part was definitely in both quotations......I think this is a theme that should be condemned by all people of good will, Jew and Gentile alike....

That's all you had to say 7 pages ago instead of trying to pretend they (the quotes) didn't exist. I didn't get that quote from stormfront, or any idiotic Aryan Nation type site. Some of the CRAP that Luther wrote is disgusting and inflammitory and blames ALL Jews for a few criminal banksters who acted in concert with "Christian" Royalty to defraud and murder common people Jewish and Christian alike. I'm sure Father Coughlin's radio broadcasts were just as inflammitory although I haven't read the transcripts. I also wholeheartedly condemn the racist rantings of any left or right wing nit wits. I don't think it is any more "ok" to attack Jews simply for being Jews (or any other reason except in self defense) any more that it is ok for the Israeli right wing Zionists who have been in control of Israel since before it's inception to attack Palistinians.

did you make an honest mistake, or are you a liar? it is highly dishonest to falsely attribute a quote to a writer, when they clearly did not write it.

if you had written this in a publication, you could be sued.
 
 
..crickets.
 
 
I think that this question is best directed to Mr. jmh423:

When (not if) it is demonstrated to you that the quotes you posted are false, will you question the sources where YOU read them? Will you ask - " why are they lying about this ?" Will you question whether the opinions you formed based on these lies are indeed the correct ones?

These are not matters of translation. They are matters of fact. Why are your sources lying about facts? If they want to blame Jews for everything, surely they could just use the tremendous amount of published material that could be cited accurately, no?
 
 
no. this is something else. JMH423 attributed a quote to a source that had a similar quote, but not the same quote. His quote, was a lot more provacative.

So, either he did not actually read the source of his quote to make sure they matched, or he dishonestly attributed a more provacative quote from a less trusted source, to a source that is more trusted.

I have to assume that his true source, is a Neo-Nazi or white supremacist web site.

why else would be refuse to reveal the true source?

3 - he's completely clueless that people make **** up that defames Jews.
4 - he lacks the ability to evaluate information and assess its credibility (some call this 'gullible')
5 - he's a white supremacist and is rightfully embarrassed to reveal his reading material.
6 - insanity.

Bla, Bla Bla......

This SLIMY tactic of nit picking quotes and trying to discredit thier authenticity by stating that they come from some disreputable publication, (at least in your eyes) is a classic Zio-Nazi/ADL style disinfo technique. Laughably transparent and pitifully WEAK. Either they said it or they didn't, either they believe it or they don't. It does not make ONE BIT of difference whether it was printed in the NY Times or the KKK monthly... The point remains that some well respected Jewish leaders have been exposed as racist maniacs, and people in power have used this as cover for terrorism, murder and ethnic cleansing. The old "we are god's favorite people, therefore whatever heinous deeds we do are just and holy", crap. Some of these types have close associations with US and Israeli leaders. What is even more troubling are some of the quotes ON THE RECORD made by high ranking Israeli Officials. Racism is an ugly thing even when practiced by Jews...Thanks

Both quotes reek of religious ignorance and intolerance, but Jews aren't the only people guilty of this. It also doesn't prove anything being argued about the "zionist agenda"; it's just the words of some religious fundamentalist - Judaism has them just the same as any other religion.. But JMH, I don't understand how you can't see the problem surrounding the doctored quote. It's obviously been altered to suit a specific audience - in this case the christian supremacists.

Has the original source surfaced for either of them?

I can't believe that you don't understand this. You haven't "pointed out" anything. What you posted is false. It is not true. Those people didn't say those things. You (and your racist websites) have drawn conclusions that are unsupported by fact.
Your "Newsweek" quote is a lie. The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is a lie. The "Bankers Manifesto" / U.S. Bankers (Association?) Magazine is a lie. The quote "non-Jewish soul comes from three satanic spheres" is a lie. The Jewish Week article is a lie.
To the standards of this forum, you have posted nothing other than unsubstantiated rumor. Fiction. Again, feel free to prove me wrong.

yup. no hatred of Jews here. nothing to see here. just respect for Jews here. nothing to see.

though, at least now we have the TRUE source of JMH423's quote. a blatantly anti-Semitic website. just as we figured.

respect for Judaism and Jews? only against Zionist Jews and Lubavitchers huh? BS. your posted articles prove otherwise. and we knew it.

The Truth shall set you Free.
 
 
So, I clicked one source that I thought would be credible, and (surprise!) the quote "satanic spheres" does not appear there.

jmh423, Can you please explain how  this link to a book on google books that you posted  supports your argument in any way?
 
 
Chabad Lubavitch isn't even the biggest orthodox Jewish movement. So I keep on wondering: why does jmh423 want to sell it to us as if Rabbi Schneerson was any kind of religious authority for both Jews in general and Jews in Israel?
Makes as much sense as taking Fred Phelps as an authority on Christian theology.

Exactly. Even if someone did say it or something similar, it proves nothing except the existence of extreme views. I think focusing on these quotes is missing the point. Even if there are fundamentalist Jews - there are indeed Rabbis who hold extreme separatist/supremacist views, and denying they exist isn't honest - but he's still not proved their influence on (any) government, or that there's some all encompassing zionist/supremacist conspiracy.
 
 
Wow the Lubavitch Chasidim are a respected group, they make up the great minority of American Jews...and even American Orthodox Jews.

The reason for trying to portray Schneerson as some sort of dominant figure in American Judaism is as clear as the swastika is crooked.
 
 
Right. Just to parse jmh423's argument. His words are in bold.

The point remains that some well respected Jewish leaders have been exposed as racist maniacs - no "well respected Jewish leaders" have been quoted here.

, and people in power have used this as cover for terrorism, murder and ethnic cleansing. - no "people in power" have been quoted here as justifying anything or using it as cover.

The old "we are god's favorite people, therefore whatever heinous deeds we do are just and holy", crap. - yes, it's crap. which is why the racist websites make up lies.
 
 
well, lets be honest now. there are a few very racist and intolerant Rabbis..especially in the West Bank. i have exposed this in a few threads.

but the websites he posted do not simply attack the few racist rabbis. they attack ALL of Judaism. they are anti-Semitic and hate Jews and Judaism.

I guess the only Jews these guys like, are non-Jewish Jews.

"Public Papers of the Presidents
April 4, 1985

CITE: 1985 Pub. Papers
LENGTH: 365 words
HEADLINE: Education Day, U.S.A., 1985
HIGHLIGHT: Proclamation 5317.
BODY: By the President of the United States of America

A proclamation

In order to achieve its highest goals, education must be more than just a training in facts and figures, or even in basic skills, as important as they are. It must also include instruction in the deepest ethical values of our civilization.

Very few Americans have done more to promote these ethical values as the basis of civilization than Rabbi Mendel Schneerson, the leader of the worldwide Lubavitch movement. The word "Lubavitch" comes from the name of a Russian city and means city of love. That is very appropriate because, of all the ethical values which inform our civilization, none is more important than love of wisdom, love of our fellowman, and love of our Creator.

These are the values which Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson exemplifies. And they are the values, with their roots in the Seven Noahide Laws, which have guided the Lubavitch movement throughout its history. They are the essence of education at its best, and we should be certain that we pass on this precious heritage to all young Americans.

In recognition of Rabbi Schneerson's contributions and in honor of his 83rd birthday, which falls this year on April 2, the Congress, by House Joint Resolution 186, has designated April 2, 1985, as "Education Day, U.S.A." and authorized and requested the President to issue an appropriate proclamation in observance of this event.

Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Tuesday, April 2, 1985, as Education Day, U.S.A., and I call upon the people of the United States, and in particular our teachers and other educational leaders, to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.

In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and ninth."

Ronald Reagan

LIES ALL LIES I TELL YA!!!!

Proclamation 5314 -- National Weather Satellite Week, 1985

April 4, 1985

By the President of the United States

of America

A Proclamation

The United States' weather satellites have tracked the Earth's weather since April 1, 1960, and have brought unique benefits to the American people and to the world.

Weather satellites have proven exceptionally valuable in detecting, monitoring, and giving early warning of hurricanes, severe storms, flash floods, and other life-threatening natural hazards, on a local, national, and international basis.

The international weather satellite search-and-rescue program has saved over three hundred lives since 1982. The achievements of the scientific and aerospace communities in developing weather satellites have contributed significantly to the United States' leadership in satellite technology, international cooperation in space, and an integrated global weather forecasting system.

Weather satellites have evolved into environmental satellites that also monitor snow and ice cover, forest damage, vegetation, forest fires, volcanic eruptions, sea surface temperatures, and ocean currents.

Environmental satellite data are used for research and for commercial purposes in meteorology, hydrology, agriculture, oceanography, forestry, and fisheries. The United States' prestige is enhanced by the direct dissemination of environmental satellite data to more than one hundred and twenty countries.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has been the world leader in the development of experimental and prototypical weather and environmental satellites. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the Department of Commerce has demonstrated outstanding leadership in the management of operational weather and environmental satellite systems and programs.

The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 62, has designated the week of March 31, 1985 through April 6, 1985, as ``National Weather Satellite Week,'' and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this event.

Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning March 31, 1985 through April 6, 1985, as National Weather Satellite Week. In recognition of the twenty-fifth anniversary of weather satellites, I call upon the people of the United States to observe such week with appropriate ceremonies.

In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this 4th day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and ninth.

Ronald Reagan

ALL of the quotes you cited above are real and I'm sure you are fully aware of this.

 
As a reminder:
* Your "Newsweek" quote is a lie.
* The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is a lie.
* The "Bankers Manifesto" / U.S. Bankers (Association?) Magazine is a lie.
* The quote "non-Jewish soul comes from three satanic spheres" is a lie.
* The Jewish Week article is a lie.

As I stated before, please feel free to prove me wrong.

Regarding the Reagan quote - would you agree that, in the 24 years since that proclamation, " nwo noachide judge and courts " have NOT in fact replaced our judicial system? Would you agree that this is an indicator of the reliability of your reading material?
 
 
 
And your counterpoint to my assertion that high ranking US officials have constantly honored racist supremicist ranting lunitics such as Schneerson is???

 
Remind me of the date of the jewish week article? 1996 was it? And when was Reagan in office? Supposing he did say what you allege he did, how do you know he held those views years previously? And how do you know, that even if he did, Reagan knew about them? That's justy one man, how can you prove the others held these views?

And that's going on the assumption that the Jewish week quote is correct. Which we don't know as conveniently no one can find!

edit: In fact, forget most of the above, I'm not wasting time on this until you provide a legit source for the quote.
 
 
The NWO like to take their time.
 
 
 
And your counterpoint to my assertion that high ranking US officials have constantly honored racist supremicist ranting lunitics such as Schneerson is???

 
you refuse to admit that you dishonestly attributed a quote to someone who did not write it. until you come clean, your views and opinions are pretty meaningless. and very unreliable.

as far as I am concerned, unless you provide an accurate source for EVERYTHING you claim, all of your accusations are suspect and should be taken with a ton of salt.

1)The Newsweek quote is genuine...

2)The protocols are attempting to be carried out as we speak by a small ruling elite. However their recent worldwide exposure due to the internet has been very effective in exposing the thieving bankers who are now running scared.

3)The quotes regarding the "Bankers Manifesto" et al are real and were presented in Congress almost a century ago by Congressman Lindberg and others.

4)The quote that the "non Jewish soul comes from three satanic spheres" is obviously a lie, but that hasn't stopped dozens of Jewish racist lunitics from repeating it and teaching it to children for decades...

As I stated before...proof cannot be ascertained in an internet chat room. I have provided ample evidence that there have been, AND STILL ARE many influential religious leaders who are racist raving lunitics. What needs to be done is let our leaders know that it is not acceptable to legitimize these whack jobs, and therefore their teachings any more than some group or leader of the toothless, tatooed meth cooking militia nuts...If I see the Aryan Brotherhood's leader being honored at the White House, I'll be the first to speak out.
 
 
I think what we need to do is teach our children not to believe raving lunatics posting on internet forums.

and if it is a lie...how can you claim that dozens of Jewish racists teach it to children?

why are you working soo hard to defame Jews and spread hatred of the Jewish people?

I'm not in an internet chat room. I'm in a big city in the USA. If I had posted those things, I could prove them quite easily. As I stated, feel free.

Could you please answer one thing though?

Regarding the Reagan quote - would you agree that, in the 24 years since that proclamation, " nwo noachide judge and courts " have NOT in fact replaced our judicial system?

Would you agree that this is an indicator of the reliability of your reading material? I mean, you linked that article for us to see. What that article predicted hasn't come true in 24 years. Do you see why we are skeptical of your conclusions?

Just for clarity for those who didn't click it - jmh's "source" for Reagan's proclamation started with this. It also seems to hint that this implementation of Noachide Judges was suggested by Al Gore.

 
Noachide Judges and Courts will Replace the

Existing Court System of Each Country

Al Gore Letter 10 01-Nov-2000 Education Day USA

[Upon seizing the reins of government, the new Noachide leaders will move quickly to implement a full agenda of reform.... Full support will be given to Israeli forces to reinvade PLO-controlled areas, with military assistance offered where necessary. Jewish courts... will be granted full legal sovereignty over Jewish citizens within each country, who will no longer be subject to the authority of gentile courts.

The pre-existing Noachide judges and courts will replace the existing court system of each country, and the legal code will be drastically rewritten to conform to halacha........ And law and order will be fully restored through the establishment of internal security measures, again in accordance with Torah law. — Committee for Israeli Victory]

It's from  here , the link jmh423 posted with the Reagan proclamation.

The most logical conclusion at this point is that he gets these quotes from stormfront or wherever, then when asked for sources, he googles them and tries to post a less-offensive source. I can't explain it any other logical way.

Those who teach these idiotic premises to children and others have defamed the Jews who don't subscribe to this idiocy...Don't shoot the messenger champ. And quit deflecting the blame away from those who are responsible for the defamation.

The funniest thing is that Schneerson was even criticised by reform and conservative Jews about his beliefs. So not really the ONE spokesperson for American Jews. But that is surely again only disinfo that you do not need to look into closely.
And while that comment by Schneerson isn't particularly nice, I don't see that it differs much from contemporary orthodox/fundamentalist about society.
Where is your proof that thinking like that actually influenced Reagan et al. ? Reagan is talking about the Seven Noahide Laws which form the basis (if you want to believe the biblical tradition) for the Ten Commandments, not some "jews are superior" stuff.
Neither the Schneerson quote nor the Education Day proclamation is any proof of a conspiracy. And where is your proof of a Schneerson-Mossad connection btw.?
 
 
Oldest smear tactic in the world; Take the most extreme, wack job members of a group and portray them as being representitive of a group.
 
 
Some posters seem to have overlooked the fact that the Jewish Week quote isn't attributed to Schneerson, it's was (allegedly) Yitzchak Ginsburgh. While all the Reagan stuff applies to Schneerson alone. So JMH:

1) Did Ginsbergh ever go to the Whitehouse?
2) Did the rest of the Lubavitchers know that Ginsbergh taught/thought these things?
3)If so, did they?
4)Did Reagan et al know about it, if the answer to any of the above is "yes"?
5)Were they influenced by the group in any way more than it was documented, ie foreign policy/political decisions?
6)Is the quote even accurate?
7)If it is accurate, is it in context?
8)Are there politicians in positions in the U.S, Israel or anywhere else that hold positions of power that hold the same views and are implicit in crimes against non Jews? (Specifically because of these beliefs)

Can you answer any of these? And more importantly can you prove any of them?
 
 
 
My agenda is clear: WORLD PEACE and Prosperity for ALL men..

 
and a world free of Jews. why else would you post and link to venomous anti-Semitic websites?

the hatred and racism in your posts is as clear as Goering was fat.

What Israel Shahak Tells Us
About Rabbi Schneerson

However, evaluations of Rabbi Schneerson's contribution are not always as overwhelmingly positive as we have seen above, as is exemplified in the writings of Israel Shahak:

My final, more general example is, if possible, even more shocking than the others. It concerns the attitude of the Hassidic movement toward non-Jews. Hassidism — a continuation ( and debasement! ) of Jewish mysticism — is still a living movement, with hundreds of thousands of active adherents who are fanatically devoted to their "holy rabbis," some of whom have acquired a very considerable political influence in Israel, among the leaders of most parties and even more so in the higher echelons of the army.
What, then, are the views of this movement concerning non-Jews? As an example, let us take the famous Hatanya, fundamental book of the Habbad movement, one of the most important branches of Hassidism. According to this book, all non-Jews are totally satanic creatures "in whom there is absolutely nothing good." Even a non-Jewish embryo is qualitatively different from a Jewish one. The very existence of a non-Jew is "inessential," whereas all of creation was created solely for the sake of the Jews.

This book is circulated in countless editions, and its ideas are further propagated in the numerous "discourses" of the rabbi, M. M. Schneurssohn, who leads this powerful world-wide organisation from his New York headquarters. In Israel these ideas are widely disseminated among the public at large, in the schools and in the army. (According to the testimony of Shulamit Aloni, Member of the Knesset, this Habbad propaganda was particularly stepped up before Israel's invasion of Lebanon in March 1978, in order to induce military doctors and nurses to withhold medical help from "Gentile wounded." This Nazi-like advice did not refer specifically to Arabs or Palestinians, but simply to "Gentiles," goyim.) A former Israeli President, Shazar, was an ardent adherent of Habbad, and many top Israeli and American politicians — headed by Prime Minister Begin — publicly courted and supported it. This, in spite of the considerable unpopularity of the Lubavitcher rabbi — in Israel he is widely criticised because he refuses to come to the Holy Land even for a visit and keeps himself in New York for obscure messianic reasons, while in New York his anti-Black attitude is notorious.

The fact that, despite these pragmatic difficulties, Habbad can be publicly supported by so many top political figures owes much to the thoroughly disingenuous and misleading treatment by almost all scholars who have written about the Hassidic movement and its Habbad branch. This applies particularly to all who have written or are writing about it in English. They suppress the glaring evidence of the old Hassidic texts as well as the latter-day political implications that follow from them, which stare in the face of even a casual reader of the Israeli Hebrew press, in whose pages the Lubavitcher rabbi and other Hassidic leaders constantly publish the most rabid bloodthirsty statements and exhortations against all Arabs.

A chief deceiver in this case, and a good example of the power of deception, was Martin Buber. His numerous works eulogising the whole Hassidic movement (including Habbad) never so much as hint at the real doctrines of Hassidism concerning non-Jews. The crime of deception is all the greater in view of the fact that Buber's eulogies of Hassidism were first published in German during the period of the rise of German nationalism and the accession of Nazism to power. But while ostensibly opposing Nazism, Buber glorified a movement holding and actually teaching doctrines about non-Jews not unlike the Nazi doctrines about Jews. One could of course argue that the Hassidic Jews of seventy or fifty years ago were the victims, and a "white lie" favouring a victim is excusable. But the consequences of deception are incalculable. Buber's works were translated into Hebrew, were made a powerful element of the Hebrew education in Israel, have greatly increased the power of the blood-thirsty Hassidic leaders, and have thus been an important factor in the rise of Israeli chauvinism and hate of all non-Jews. If we think of the many human beings who died of their wounds because Israeli army nurses, incited by Hassidic propaganda, refused to tend them, then a heavy onus for their blood lies on the head of Martin Buber.

So you are saying that Israel Shahak is a "self hating Jew"....And that's it...Hmmm...I guess that's the canned ADL answer for any Jew who disagrees with these racist lunitics, exposes them and makes it clear that he is NOT one of them...Pretty weaselie answer mate. Benjamin Freedman converted to Catholicism and then he liked himself fine. No self hating involved there. I was born and raised a Catholic but later discarded it because I found that it was a bunch of crap. Does that make me "self hating"? Are all converts somehow "self hating" according to you? By the way Freedman is not one of my heros...Roberto Clemente is though..

First of all I respect Judaism about as much as I do Christianity, Islam, Hinduism etc. I think all have been misused by power brokers against true believers. However I respect all people of good will no matter what religion they happen to believe in.

If Schneerson actually spoke of or wrote about, "The Jewish Victory over all Slavs" and someone pointed out that this was how the Rebbe (who was there during the Bolchevik Revolution) described it in his writings and speeches, how is pointing out that fact, "Jew-hatred to the core"? Thanks

(The link on the site seems to have been sanitized to hide evidence that may point to the fact that he did say it or write about it....None the less, my question was posed as a hypothetical.)

until you prove that he said it, it is a disgusting anti-Semitic lie. and you have a very bad track record when it comes to providing legitimate evidence.

someone who posts a quote and knowingly links it to a source that has a slightly different yet much more inflammatory quote, is not someone who can simply be trusted.

For a critical thinking skeptic, you seem to have trouble with this concept:

It does not matter if the referenced quote is proven beyond a reasonable doubt to be authentic, here and now on the internet as to it being a "disgusting anti-semitic lie" or not. Again, the only thing that DOES matter in reference to that is whether or not Schneerson actually said or wrote it. We will find out at some point....My money is on "He said it or wrote about it, just like the Newsweek article will contain the quote I attributed. But I could be wrong about one or both....You are conveniently assuming "facts" not in evidence again.

I didn't say that they "Control Judaism or Israel". What I did say is that it is quite scary seeing these people being photographed and honored by the President of The US and Congressional leaders. I am also concerned with alleged close ties that men like Dov Zakheim and Michael Chertoff have to these lunatics...

Israel Shahak who seems more than credible intimated that these radicals have a great influence on the Israeli leadership especially in the military, which I'm sure you also find troubling. Thanks

All three of those statements are false...But who's counting?
 
 
 
The most dangerous are the ones who have access to leaders of militarily powerful countries such as the US, Israel, and UK. That is why I pointed out the danger of this crazed bunch called the Chabad Lubavitchers. Racist, supremicist maniacs in positions of power are extremely dangerous to all of us.

 

 
Are you kidding? How about Gaza, funded with US taxpayer dollars and munitions used to kill innocents and bring about their zio-dream world. Iraq war was promulgated by zionis whack jobs like Perle, Wolfowitz, Cheney and the PNAC gang along with those Zio-Christian cultists you mentioned. Right now the same pack of rats is trying to get us into a war with Iran...Who coined the phrase "Axis Of Evil"? David Frum another racist zionist creep. Wake up pal. The so called religious leaders of these uber zionists are the Lebovitchers. Thanks

 
May I point you to your very own statements?
You still fail to provide evidence that Chabad Lubavitch has influence over world leaders in the way you ascribe to them. And over the cited Jewish Americans. You still only imply a conspiracy with the link being both sides involved being Jewish (and not necessarily Jewish in the same flavour).
That isn't skeptical, that is conspirathink.

"An even greater difference exists in regard to the soul. Two contrary types of soul exist, a non-Jewish soul comes from three satanic spheres, while the Jewish soul stems from holiness."

the above link includes NO such quote.

 http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/False...ewish_race.htm 

the above link is the TRUE source of the quote, a vehemently anti-Semitic and disgusting website.

 
This is from the " vehemently anti-Semitic and disgusting website." that parky cited":

Are Jewish people "better" than others?

No, we are are created EQUAL in God's eyes!

"For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him." -Romans 10:12 (King James Bible)

This website is a from Christian Bible thumper who is simply pointing out that some who call themselves Jews subscribe to the ridiculous notion that Jews are a superior race and that all non Jews are inherently evil. As Harry Truman said: "I'm just telling the truth on them, and they call it hell." This is not a hate site or "anti-semitic" in any way. The disgusting quotes are those that come directly from Jewish Supremicist "holy books" that are now being taught to children in Israel and in the radical Lubavitcher sect headquartered in Brooklyn. Here is an excerpt regaurding the Imperial Wizard type leader of this looney sect that is highly praised by key members involved in US and Israeli politics:

In our generation, the spiritual leader of the Jewish people  and therefore of the whole world  is Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson (known as the "Lubavitcher Rebbe"), in New York. He is a righteous prophet who has never sinned, nor even been tempted, in his entire life; indeed, he has brought hundreds of thousands of Jews and gentiles back to the Law. Moreover, he is a direct descendant of King David. [Ednote: 1 John 1:8 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.]
 www.noahide.com/flier.htm 

Now again here is an excerpt from the so called disgusting anti-semetic site that parky is so concerned with....You decide which one is more dangerous to the people of the world in general....

Are Jewish people "better" than others?

No, we are are created EQUAL in God's eyes!

"For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him." -Romans 10:12 (King James Bible)

I am not a bible thumper but I concur that we are all created equal, and that some whacky nit wit from Brooklyn is not the king of the world....How about you parky?

 http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/False...ewish_race.htm 

and so is this:

" Today, in fact, it is Jews who make all these poisonous claims to racial superiority. No, not all the Jews. But, as I will document, a huge number of leaders among the Jews ascribe to these wicked and dangerous theories of racial and blood superiority."

and this:

" Since the Jews are claimed to be the Master Race, whose souls are said by the Talmud to be on a far higher plane than the animalistic, "satanic souls" of Gentiles, it is common for Jewish authorities to brand all Gentiles by the derogatory Yiddish term "goy," a term akin to a curse word. Meanwhile, Arabs are deemed so inferior they are even lower than the goy."

and this:

" Indeed, the hate-filled, anti-Christian movie, The Last Temptation of Christ, produced by Universal Studios and its Chairman, the Jew, Lewis Wasserman, was an accurate, if disgusting, reflection of what the Jews' most holy book, the Talmud, teaches."

and this:

" The Talmud is full of language that portrays the Jews as God's Master Race and depicts all other races as trash and garbage. It warns Jews to stay away from Christians because Christians are said to be "unclean" and "murderers." On the other hand, a Jew is pictured as one of God's Chosen People. The Jew is said to possess so great a dignity that no one, not even an angel, can share equality with him. In fact, the Jew is said to be the equal of God. "

and this:

" In Rome, Italy, in 2000, Italian police broke up a ring of eleven top Jewish gangsters. It was discovered that they had been kidnapping Gentile (non-Jewish) children between the ages of two and five from orphanages, raping them, and then murdering the children."

Was it Judaism's most holy book, the Talmud, that put it in the hearts of those monsters to commit such brutish and evil crimes against children? After all, their Talmud says that if a grown man rapes a young girl under three years of age, "it is nothing." And Gentiles, according to the Talmud, may be killed practically without restriction."

and this:

" In any event, the Jewish Master Race cannot be held to normal standards of righteousness and morality. They are said to be "beyond good and evil." That is what Adolf Hitler believed about the Aryans. It is what Ariel Sharon and hundreds of Jewish rabbis and Illuminists believe about the Jews."

and this:

" The Jews fervently believe their blood is divine, and that only the Jews comprise a Holy Nation. They view themselves as "God's Chosen," a special Master Race. Their Zionist leaders smugly view other peoples as vermin, as inferior and of little value."

" Moreover, our God is preparing for them a great surprise. Unless they repent of their racism and sins and turn to Jesus Christ, these elitist Jews are going to a place where there is a lot of room.

Indeed, Proverbs 27:20 and Isaiah 5:14 assure us that Hell is never full, and is always being enlarged. Thus, there is plenty of room amidst the flames for the ungodly Jews whose arrogance and pride cause them to esteem themselves the Master Race."

nothing anti-Semitic here. Just Christian love of mankind. Nothing to see here folks. Jews are held in the highest esteem by this web site.

This seems to be a general theme among conspiracists, that the "illuminati" / masons / jews / elites have a thing for raping children. I have seen it a number of times here at jref. I guess because it's the worst thing you can imagine, therefore the worst people must be doing it?

Go here, to see the TRUTH about what the Talmud says about Gentiles.

Now, some Jews of course are bad and do not follow the laws of the Torah. There are no more bad Jews, than there are bad Christians. But most Jews do follow this rule:

"When an alien lives with you in your land, do not mistreat him. The alien living with you must be treated as one of your native-born. Love him as yourself, for you were aliens in Egypt. I am the Lord your God"

-Leviticus 19:33

Are non-Jews treated in Israel perfectly? Of course not. But have non-Jews been treated in Israel the way Jews have been treated in Gentile lands, over the last 2,000 years???? Certainly not.

Jews and Israel have a long way to go. But we certainly are acting better then the way we have been treated by our Gentile hosts.

the fact remains, that JMH423's website is full of anger, hate, and lust for Jews to go to Hell. while the Noahide site, as wacky and silly as it may be, paves a CLEAR path for ALL PEOPLES, Jews and Gentiles, to bring peace and salvation to the Earth.

I agree with you on those points. However I do not consider Jewish Americans alien in any way, nor has it been my observation that they have been held down by gentiles in the US. To the contrary, as a whole the Jewish community has flourished in the US. They are simply Americans as are Irish Americans, Italian Americans, African Americans etc.

What I am pointing out on this thread a crazy racist sect who are claiming to be Jews that are giving richeous Jews world a bad name. I believe they should be exposed for what they are, and watched closely much like these so called Christian Militia groups who are really White Supremicists, or Muslim radical groups who feel that it is OK for them to kill infidels. My concern with the Lubavitchers is that they seem to have many US politicians fooled into thinking that they are not dangerous racist looneys, which they definitely are. Thanks

um.....you may not know...but many high-end universities in the USA had Jew-quotas until the 1960s.

Jews were routinely kept out of neighborhoods across this country. Even today in NYC, applicants to certain gated communities are asked to present a letter of recommendation from their "pastor or priest".

yes, even in the USA, Jews faced discrimination. Peter Stuyvesant tried to kick us out of New Amsterdam. General Grant tried to exile Jews out of parts of the South that he occupied during the Civil War. Jews faced massive discrimination in immigration policy from 1924-1964.

did we suffer as much as blacks or Native Americans did? nope. but we did suffer.
 
 
Again, from the Lubavitcher Noahide site:

" Regardless of your race, religious background, or nationality, G-d is calling on you to help the Jewish people bring the Messiah. You don't have to be Jewish to help "

I see no hatred or racism here.

excerpt:

Salvation Through the Law

The Jewish people have been taught the secret to eternal life and blessings for all people, and now they finally have the freedom to reveal G-d's message.

According to that message, the key that unlocks the door to a personal relationship with G-d is His Law one part for the Jews, the other part for the rest of the world.....

parky must have forgot about that part.....LOL....

I agree that there are some over the top assertions and misrepresentations in Marrs website.

The thread we are posting on is under the heading of whether "CTists" believe ANY Muslim-extremist terror attacks were real...I believe there have been several such attacks in the past 5 decades. However I believe that several of those attributed to so called Muslim Extremists have actually been false flag attacks perpetrated by those who are yearning for this crazy "Final War For Jeruselem. I agree that there are muslim extremists, my assertion is that these vile Jewish extremist racists are far more dangerous because of the monetary and political clout they have throughout the world. I believe them at their word when they say that the want to subvert US soverignty and put us under some whacky set of laws made up by a bunch of sneaky self serving power brokers hundreds of years ago. I'd just like to stick as close as possible to the US Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Thanks

Thanks JMH for the interesting thread...I'm becoming somewhat of a student of orthodox Judaism! All quite interesting...By the way, did you find a source for your quotes yet? Just curious, because i can find nothing in any Chabad literature that I've read to suggest they think anything remotely similar. In fact, I've found quite a few sources that say pretty much the opposite (these were also written for a jewish audience, not us gentiles), and say that even the most evil of souls contains a spark of good. I don't think you've read any other hasidic texts other that the worthless, evil goyim crap that gets posted on stormfront & david duke etc.

You can get this book at any fairly large Public Library. Written by former IDF Soldier and Professor in an Israeli University. This and all other quotations and assertions are impeccably sourced....Thanks for your continued support. Remember pp. 26-28

Israel Shahak, Jewish History, Jewish Religion: The Weight of Three Thousand Years, Pluto Press, London and Boulder Colorado, 1994, pp. 26-28.:

Excerpt:

"My final, more general example is, if possible, even more shocking than the others. It concerns the attitude of the Hassidic movement toward non-Jews. Hassidism  a continuation (and debasement!) of Jewish mysticism  is still a living movement, with hundreds of thousands of active adherents who are fanatically devoted to their "holy rabbis," some of whom have acquired a very considerable political influence in Israel, among the leaders of most parties and even more so in the higher echelons of the army.

What, then, are the views of this movement concerning non-Jews? As an example, let us take the famous Hatanya, fundamental book of the Habbad movement, one of the most important branches of Hassidism. According to this book, all non-Jews are totally satanic creatures "in whom there is absolutely nothing good." Even a non-Jewish embryo is qualitatively different from a Jewish one. The very existence of a non-Jew is "inessential," whereas all of creation was created solely for the sake of the Jews.

This book is circulated in countless editions, and its ideas are further propagated in the numerous "discourses" of the rabbi, M. M. Schneurssohn, who leads this powerful world-wide organisation from his New York headquarters. In Israel these ideas are widely disseminated among the public at large, in the schools and in the army. (According to the testimony of Shulamit Aloni, Member of the Knesset, this Habbad propaganda was particularly stepped up before Israel's invasion of Lebanon in March 1978, in order to induce military doctors and nurses to withhold medical help from "Gentile wounded." This Nazi-like advice did not refer specifically to Arabs or Palestinians, but simply to "Gentiles," goyim.) A former Israeli President, Shazar, was an ardent adherent of Habbad, and many top Israeli and American politicians  headed by Prime Minister Begin  publicly courted and supported it. This, in spite of the considerable unpopularity of the Lubavitcher rabbi  in Israel he is widely criticised because he refuses to come to the Holy Land even for a visit and keeps himself in New York for obscure messianic reasons, while in New York his anti-Black attitude is notorious.

The fact that, despite these pragmatic difficulties, Habbad can be publicly supported by so many top political figures owes much to the thoroughly disingenuous and misleading treatment by almost all scholars who have written about the Hassidic movement and its Habbad branch. This applies particularly to all who have written or are writing about it in English. They suppress the glaring evidence of the old Hassidic texts as well as the latter-day political implications that follow from them, which stare in the face of even a casual reader of the Israeli Hebrew press, in whose pages the Lubavitcher rabbi and other Hassidic leaders constantly publish the most rabid bloodthirsty statements and exhortations against all Arabs.

A chief deceiver in this case, and a good example of the power of deception, was Martin Buber. His numerous works eulogising the whole Hassidic movement (including Habbad) never so much as hint at the real doctrines of Hassidism concerning non-Jews. The crime of deception is all the greater in view of the fact that Buber's eulogies of Hassidism were first published in German during the period of the rise of German nationalism and the accession of Nazism to power. But while ostensibly opposing Nazism, Buber glorified a movement holding and actually teaching doctrines about non-Jews not unlike the Nazi doctrines about Jews. One could of course argue that the Hassidic Jews of seventy or fifty years ago were the victims, and a "white lie" favouring a victim is excusable. But the consequences of deception are incalculable. Buber's works were translated into Hebrew, were made a powerful element of the Hebrew education in Israel, have greatly increased the power of the blood-thirsty Hassidic leaders, and have thus been an important factor in the rise of Israeli chauvinism and hate of all non-Jews. If we think of the many human beings who died of their wounds because Israeli army nurses, incited by Hassidic propaganda, refused to tend them, then a heavy onus for their blood lies on the head of Martin Buber."

got anything else for us from 1983?

lolololololol
 
 
 
What, then, are the views of this movement concerning non-Jews? As an example, let us take the famous Hatanya, fundamental book of the Habbad movement, one of the most important branches of Hassidism. According to this book, all non-Jews are totally satanic creatures "in whom there is absolutely nothing good." Even a non-Jewish embryo is qualitatively different from a Jewish one. The very existence of a non-Jew is "inessential," whereas all of creation was created solely for the sake of the Jews.

 
If his book is so impeccably sourced, does he tell us where to find this quote in the Tanya?

i have never heard of this book.

sorry folks, but until a few years ago, I considered Chassidim to be the Jewish equivalent of the Amish.

but lets say, for arguments sake, that there are some writings that are less than kind and nice to Gentiles.

so what. there are many MORE writings, which do not have hateful or demeaning messages about Gentiles.

like the Noahide site that JMH423 loves to source, Gentiles are given an equal place in God's kingdom. In fact, it is EASIER for Gentiles to be in God's favor. They only have 7 laws to follow, while Jews have 613.

Meanwhile, according to Christianity, there is NO way for a Jew to enter God's kingdom without accepting Jesus as his Lord and Savior.
 
 
This is the book in question:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanya 

As you said above, so what? There are questionable passages in every religious book. Not that this is one to anyone outside the chabad group as far as I know.

In 1797, when this document was written, Jews lived under incredible persecution in many parts of the world. We would not receive full political rights in most of Europe until the early 1900s.

within this context, especially in backwards Eastern Europe, if some Jews regarded Gentiles in a less than positive light, I could not blame them.

Hell, in Poland and Russia, Jews were treated like **** and faced constant pogroms. I would hate Gentiles too.

Here is an interesting customer review:

A guide to understanding Israel., April 17, 1998
By  joe.baker@virgin.net  (London, England) - See all my reviews

"In his most illuminating and disturbing book Professor Shahak takes the lid off previously hidden Orthodox Jewish beliefs and practices. He explains how these beliefs are at the heart of the Zionist adventure and constitute a major influence upon Israeli government policies and actions. We are made aware of the paradox of a largely secular state basing its raison d'etre and future direction upon biblical text. The depth of Orthodox Jewish antipathy toward the gentile, and especially toward Christianity (and Jesus) will come as an unsettling surprise to the many millions of American evangelical Christians who uncritically accept a fawning admiration of all things Israeli repeatedly displayed by the TV evangelists. Frightening, too, is the near-total control of most Jewish organizations now in the hands of Zionists; it is now almost impossible for a Jew to openly disassociate him or herself from, let alone be critical of, the state of Israel or the aims of Zionism. Whereas the critical gentile must be an 'anti-Semite' so must the critical Jew be 'self-hating'. Whatever your point of view on the situation in Israel, whatever your religion or philosophical perspective, however deeply you hold your convictions, you cannot fail to be challenged by this marvelous book."
 
 
 
Exactly. Context...

 
JMH423 is basically asking slaves to love their masters.

Asking concentration camp inmates to love the Nazis.

I heard that Native Americans used to call white people bad names. How dare they!!!!!!!!

So what if the Lubavitchers are teaching this crap to 8 year olds in their summer camp programs and the IDF uses this material to justify what they are doing to the Palistinians right now..Not to mention Baruch Goldstein..Those mean gentiles in 1644 are at fault....I love you guys.....

 http://www.chabad.org/library/articl.../Chapter-1.htm 

 
From [this nefesh] stem all the evil characteristics, deriving from the four evil elements within it.
Just as the four physical elements of Fire, Air, Water and Earth are the foundation of all physical entities, so too is this nefesh comprised of four corresponding spiritual elements. Since they derive from kelipah and evil, they themselves are evil, and from them in turn one’s evil characteristics come into being.

From this soul stem also the good traits inherent in every Jew’s character, such as compassion and benevolence.

But since this is a nefesh of kelipah and evil, how do good characteristics come from it? This matter is now addressed.

For in the [case of the] Jew, this soul of kelipah is derived from the kelipah called “nogah”, which also contains good; and the good within this nefesh gives rise to these positive natural traits.

[This kelipah] is from the esoteric “Tree of Knowledge” [which is comprised] of good and evil.30

The souls of the nations of the world, however, emanate from the other, unclean kelipot which contain no good whatever,
as is written in Etz Chayim, Portal 49, ch. 3, that all the good that the nations do, is done out of selfish motives.
Since their nefesh emanates from kelipot which contain no good, it follows that any good done by them is for selfish motives.

So the Gemara31 comments on the verse,32 “The kindness of the nations is sin” — that all the charity and kindness done by the nations of the world is only for their self-glorification...

When a Jew acts in a benevolent manner he is motivated mainly out of concern for the welfare of his fellow. The proof of this is that were his fellow not to need his help, this would give him greater pleasure than the gratification derived from his act of kindness.

Concerning the nations of the world, however, this is not so. Their motivation is not the welfare of their fellow; rather, it stems from a self-serving motive — the desire for self-glorification, a feeling of gratification, and the like.

It should be noted that among the nations of the world there are also to be found those whose souls are derived from kelipat nogah.33 Called “the pious ones of the nations of the world,” these righteous individuals are benevolent not out of selfish motives but out of a genuine concern for their fellow.

 

Nice of him to throw us a bone at the end! If the Lubavitchers are following this (and it looks like they clearly are -  http://www.forward.com/search/?query...alut&x=16&y=14  -  http://www.forward.com/search/?query...alut&x=16&y=14  ) then it is a bit concerning...But I'd still like to see some evidence about their influence on government. Despite it's historical context, it pretty much speaks for itself as something that shouldn't be being taught etc.
 
 
this has become a very stupid thread.
 
 
 
umm I speak English and I am muslim and I have never called anyone an infidel. A jackass maybe but never an infidel.   (Oh and no I am not calling anyone here a jackass) well not yet anyway..  

 
Thanks for posting this. It's an important perspective. No one should hold the majority of adherents to any belief system responsible for the extreme fringe of that belief system. Religious or otherwise, there are nuts on the fringe no matter what.
 
 
 
You can get this book at any fairly large Public Library. Written by former IDF Soldier and Professor in an Israeli University. This and all other quotations and assertions are impeccably sourced....Thanks for your continued support. Remember pp. 26-28

 
Well, this weekend Fonebone will have his Newsweek issue, and I will check this book out from the Chicago Public Library. Let's hope that we aren't all disappointed!

jmh423, since we are now doing your legwork for you, and you don't seem to be contributing much, do you think that, in between golf rounds, you could maybe find a real source for your "U.S. Bankers Magazine" quote or maybe the Rebbe Schneerson "satanic spheres" nonsense? Thanks!

or you could make up a religion about a virgin whore who had sex with a Roman, and that kid was a homosexual pedophile who claimed to be the son of God.

and then, he died on the cross, cause the Romans thought he was a threat, and then his followers made believe they saw him rise from the grave, even though they were lying.

hows that sound?

This is pretty typical racist behavior. They can dog you about your race/creed/ethnicity forever, but when you attempt the same thing, even if just hyperbolizing to make a point, somehow, you are the real racist.

Well, this IS a bit of a tu quoque I suppose, but  Fitna  should be interesting for jmh423 to watch. Concerning the harmless falseflagged muslims.
(For whose doings we have some evidence).
 
 
there is no need to accuse Muslims of false-flag attacks. Shia militants do not kill other Shia. Sunni do not kill other Sunni. They do, however, kill each other.

Its not different than the 100 Years War in Europe.
 
 
And concerning the chemistry professor Shahak I recommend reading  this .

Al Qaeda are Sunni and kill lots of Sunni.

that is because they seek a Sunni-Shia civil war in Iraq. This would equal a defeat for the Bush adventure in Iraq.

chaos in Iraq= victory for Al Qaeda.

peace and quiet in Iraq= defeat for Al Qaeda.
 
 
 
And concerning the chemistry professor Shahak I recommend reading  this .

 
There are several refutations of Professor Shahak's writings. Would you expect any less considering the controversial nature of his works? I'm sure I could cite several articles and essays praising his work also. No big surprise here Moss. Thanks

All of these radical fundementalist Christians, Muslims, and Jews are simply tools used to stir the cauldren and create hate, war and destruction for profit and power of the elites. This has been going on for centuries.

That is exactly what the Soviet secret police used to say to dissenters before locking them up in mental institutions or gulags....You must be crazy if you accuse the authorities of what they are obviously doing. Were you born in the USSR? What I pointed out regarding the motive behind wars and terrorism is obvious to any clear thinking and well informed individual...Have you ever considered that you might be a little slow, or that you have a "mental disorder"...Perhaps you should explore these distinct possibilities.

I didn't say that at all. There are mentally ill people from all political genres and world views. However your cohort Carlitos blurted out an insult aimed at me because I don't conform to his obviously CNN-FOX News et al created world view. I am 55 years old and have never been diagnosed with any sort of mental illness. I'm fine, I just disagree with his and your world view. As far as all the millions worldwide who share some or most of my views regarding 911 and other issues I cannot speak for them. I can say that I have met hundreds of 911 truthers and almost all of them seemed to be intelligent and well grounded in realiity. Thanks

Just like any other person of reasonable intelligence I try to read about and observe the world from as many sources and varying point of views as possible, and draw my own conclusions. My views are not set in stone and constantly change as new information comes to light. I try to find out everything I can about my sources to evaluate their reliability, as I am sure you do. Perhaps we have drawn different conclusions based on life experience and other factors. Thanks

That said, many of your posts are indeed quite paranoid, highly irrational, and definitely full of hate.

I said early on that I am aware that there are Muslims who are involved in terrorism. You can't turn on a TV or radio without hearing about these fiendish swarthy Islamoterrorfascists, with their weird clothes and beards. My position is that they are tools for the same people who have turned the viscious dogs of war loose on the Palistinians in their homeland, who are Jewish terrorfascists and the US maniacs who have reigned unspeakable terror on the citizens of Iraq and Afghanistan, not to mention Viet Nam, Panama, Nicaragua and countless others....They are Christian terrorfascists. I say, let's expose all of them instead of continually focusing on the Muslims...Thanks

I don't recall ever meeting a 911 truther who believed that "Da Joos did 911". I am aware there are some ignorant Jew haters that blame it all on them, but I am not, nor have I personally met any. Most agree with me that there were Mossad operatives involved in the attacks, along with ISI, MI6, and CIA....Jews, Muslims, Protestants and Catholics working together to create a new world...Thanks
 
 
Without reference to your permanent mental state, could I ask about the temporary cognitive dissonance you are achieving by simultaneously believing these 2 seemingly contradictory things?

Why do you care what some bible thumping nit wits say? Are you afraid they are right? As far as terrorfascists go these wankers don't have much political clout or do much damage comparitively. The worst terror they are usually invloved in are the occasional cowardly attack on an abortion doctor, a Jewish Community center or an unarmed black man. I agree that they should be watched closely and prosecuted accordingly when they act out. However they don't even aproach the level of the three groups I mentioned earlier. The Islamo, Jewish, and Zio Christian terrorists are responsible for 10,000 times more death and destruction than all these tatooed, meth cooking, toothless Aryan Brotherhood types combined. As far as Texe Marrs he is a bible thumper but he is vehemently anti-war. I don't agree that everyone who doesn't accept Jesus is going to hell or anywhere else except maybe to titty a bar once in a while. I do not believe Marrs is an anti-semite, as he supports the semitic peoples of Palistine, and other semitic Jews who are against Zionism. You are constantly misusing the term anti-semite. Are you aware of that?

Can you differentiate between "Da Joos Did 911" and what my post clearly states? If you can not, I don't know what else I can say....Conversely I think that you and yours are stuck on: "Dem Moosalums did 911"...My post clearly said that there were Jews, Muslims, and Christians involved...Does your mental state allow you to recognise the difference between that and "Da Joos Did 911"?.
 
 
 
"Da Joos Did 911" & "Dem Moosalums did 911"...

 
yes, it is equally stupid to blame all Jews for 9-11...as it is stupid to blame all Muslims for 9-11.

and yet, no one at JREF has argued that.

though, a terrorist network of Islamic extremists does exist in our world. They have killed tens of thousands of innocent Westerners and Muslims. to deny this, is to deny fact.

no such comparable Jewish or Israeli network exists.

though, a terrorist network of Islamic extremists does exist in our world. They have killed tens of thousands of innocent Westerners and Muslims. to deny this, is to deny fact.

no such comparable Jewish or Israeli network exists.

 
And to deny that a terrorist network exists comprised of Jewish Mossad and Christian CIA operatives is quite naive also...Jewish, and Christian extremists also exist along with a world wide network of spies and disinfo experts that make these Ak Kaders look like a single A ball club compared to the New York Yankees. Al Kader is just a farm team...
 
 
 
first you question someone's attack upon YOUR possible mental condition, and now you do the same?

interesting.

 
I answered the question the way it was posed. Read the thread.
 
 
 
Yes, I can differentiate between those two statements, but I disagree with both....OBVIOUSLY.

 
And, yet again, this thread here would be a wonderful place for you to present EVIDENCE that supports your belief about something.
 
 
 
Christianity, Judaism, Islam - All a load of divisive,ignorant, bigoted crap. We'd all be better off without any of it.

 
This guy is learning.....

I'd love to sit here and play another couple of hours of 1 on 4 with you mooks but I'm going down to Zuma Beach for a winter low tide run....Enjoy your day, and keep on debunkin'...Thanks

Never heard of 9/11 did you?
Oh, you probably think that was a CIA/Mossad plot..........
 
 
You only have to go back a page or so to see that, yes.

prove it. with evidence. from a site other than Metapedia, Stormfront, Jewwatch, Rense, or some other Jew-hating website.

Excerpt:

"On July 23, 1982 "Mr. Fadl Dani, deputy head of the Palestine Liberation Organization's office in Paris, was killed by a bomb which exploded in his car as he was about to drive from his home in the 13th arrondisement of the city. According to some witnesses, Mr. Dani, who was 37, had just got into his car shortly after 8 a.m. after saying goodbye to his French wife and their five-month-old son, Said, when three mendrove past and threw the bomb through the car window...

"Mr. Ibrahim Souss, head of the PLO office in Paris, denounced the attack which, he said, 'adds to the long list of Palestinian martyrs who have fallen in Lebanon and elsewhere at the criminal hands of the Israelis.'

"In a message to Mr. Faruk Kaddumi, head of the PLO foreign affairs department, M. Claude Cheysonne, the French Foreign Minister, condemned the 'cowardly attack' on Mr. Dani, and expressed his condolences, adding that the French government would spare no effort in its search for those responsible." (57)

On May 3, 1984 Mossad agents shot and killed Hanna Moqbell, secretary general of the Arab Journalists Union, in Nicosia, Cyprus. "He was shot in his automobile in Nicosia. Mr. Moqbell's secretary, who was in the car with him, was wounded in the attack." (58)

"Mr. Moqbell, 42 years old, was a member of the Information Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization." (59)

On June 10, 1986 Mossad agents shot and killed "38 year old Khaled Ahmed Nazal, secretary general of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), in Athens, Greece. The PLO diplomatic office in Athens and DFLP headquarters in Damascus claimed he was killed by agents of the Israeli secret service. Mr. Nazal was killed by four shots to the head fired at close range by a youth waiting for him outside his hotel." (60)

On October 21, 1986 "a high ranking Palestinian official was killed by a bomb explosion while driving a rented car in a suburb of Athens, Greece at dawn. The Palestine Liberation Organization blamed the Israeli Secret Service for the death of Munzer Abu Ghazala, aged 44, a senior member of Fateh's national Palestinian council." (61)

On July 22, 1987 Mr. Ali Naji Awad Al-Adhami, "a leading Arab journalist was gunned down outside his office in Chelsea, London, England. The 48 year old cartoonist, a Palestinian, lived in London and worked for Al Qabas, a leading Kuwaiti newspaper read widely in the Middle East.

"Mr. Al Adhami was shot in the head by a gunman who approached him as he left his newspaper office in Ives Street, Chelsea, late in the afternoon. The editor of Al Qabas said, 'I don't know who could be responsible because Mr. Al Adhami has been a critic of many groups." (62) Mr. Al Adhami was a cartoonist whose pen spoofed anyone and everyone, including the Israelis. But ultimately Scotland Yard traced the assassins to the Israeli Embassy in London.

On February 14, 1988 Mossad killed two Palestinians in Limmassol, Cyprus, Abu Al Hassan Kasim and Hamdi Adwan, and wounded Marwan Kanafami. "PLO sources alleged that the Israeli secret service, Mossad, was responsible. Police said the car bomb exploded shortly after noon in the tourist area. The sources said one victim was a humanitarian affairs officer in Lebanon..."

i do not consider it a total act of terrorism, to target known militants.

PLO personnel who routinely murdered innocent children, are fair game.

but civilian casualties should be avoided at all costs. if 15 civilians will die in order to take out one bad guy, its not worth it.
 
 
 
...some other Jew-Hating website

 
Take a look at some of Issa Nakhleh's speeches, and I think you'll find that "palestine-encyclopedia.com" is in this category.
 
 
 
Got your verb tenses wrong there. Your sentence clearly says you didn't read it.

 
That is a false assertion.
 
 
if the USA sent in a CIA hit squad to take out Bin Laden, this would not be an act of terrorism. it would be an act of justice.
 
 
 
That is a false assertion.

 
i do not think you are in any position to make such a statement. you provided a false source for a quote. and you knowingly did it and failed to recant it.

...and when I confronted you on this issue in a PM, you said "sue me!!!".

I don't think that the families of those murdered care what you consider "total acts of terrorism". Civillian casualties should be avoided at all costs....Like Deir Yasin? Righto...Israel is and always has been a terrorist nation..They have constantly elected admitted terrorist murderers to high office. If a Palistinian snuck up on an Israeli Official and blew up his car in France, or Cypress, or Brussels, what would that be called? Terrorism? Oh yeah, I forgot, one set of rules for the Jews, and another for "the rest of the world"....Isn't that what it says in the book?...
 
 
Bin Laden is a Mossad patsy. Princess Diana did 9/11.

Why would CIA send a hit squad to take out one of their main assets? If CIA wanted this guy dead, he'd be dead...
 
 
Im not stepping into any running debates but responding to the OP. Here are my buddy's thoughts on the Christmas Undies Attack:

 
Yep... Dude's father is the richest man in Nigeria. The alleged bomber was highly educated and very well off. He paid cash for his ticket, had no passport, checked no baggage, only wanted to go one way and was on a watch list, yet he was allowed to board the plane with explosives strapped to his taint. Of course, that doesn't sound suspicious to you, but it's clear with a bit of critical thinking that something isn't quite right here. Especially since (problem-reaction-solution) the solution is to take away regular peoples' rights so quickly by forcing us to submit to virtual strip searches, barring us from bringing carry-on luggage etc etc etc... I'm sure it was no coincidence that, had the plane actually exploded, it would have done so over Canadian territory thus forcing us to submit to more amalgamation with our terror-fearing brothers to the south. It's funny: the day after the failed attack I read about it on one page of the star, and then read about amalgamating our borders with the US and creating a continent-wide security perimeter on the next page. Just another step towards losing our national sovereignty. Hell, read what the government is saying about why they are so quick to implement these x-rape machines in the airport: they don't want the US to be mad at us, they told us to, so that's what we have to do! Jokes.

 
In addition to being wrong, he can't seem to locate the enter key.

(we're canadian BTW which is why the focus on what we need to do to align w/ America)
 
 
x-rape machines?

So, to come to a logical conclusion, the reason the CIA set this Nigerian guy up to blow a plane out of the sky, killing everyone on board, is so....TSA workers can get their jollies at the airport. That makes sense.

I think at this point we can conclude the answer to the original post is a resounding "no." There are no Muslim-extremist terror attacks. It's all a scam in order to see boobies.

i got no problem with that. is the TSA hiring?

maybe they should now be called the T & A SA?

well, as you have provided no evidence or proof of Mossad terrorism against the USA, your post is BS.

If there truly was a conspiracy, how easy would it be to exclude that info from the indexes of google and other search engines? Pretty easy. But hey, the conspiracy is too dumb to manipulate search engines, just like it can't foil the efforts of truthers...

It is not as easy as had been hoped by the scums, to sanitize the net....Too bad for you and your buddies. The whole world is well aware of what I have been pointing out. Now even Americans who have been inundated with BS from a media totally controlled by Zionist war profiteers and their bankster masters have the option to research these events on the net. It will be all steeply down hill for the banksters and the war profiteers from here on out. The game is just about over...Better get a lawyer champ..

That's a pretty black and white worldview, and miles away from the differentiated view you pretended to have all the thread long.
If that's what you think it is pretty pointless for me to discuss with you. Because anything that might challenge your views is discarded at first sight.
Oh well, nothing I shouldn't have known all along.
 
 
 
Chaos and endless costly wars=Victory for those who profit from them....Defense contractors and bankers, oil barons and the Government sluts worldwide who are owned by them and paid handsomely to do their bidding...al Queda=Likud=Hamas=CIA=Mossad=ISI=MI6=RAW=.......Al l sluts for a small cadre of International Bankers, arms dealers, oil barons and power brokers...Connect the dots already...

 
Just a little tip for you....

If you wish to be taken seriously, avoid using the term "Government sluts" in a sentence.
 
 
What should happen to Arab-Americans who give aid and comfort to foreign agents of other governments working iin the US? Tried for TREASON and prosecuted accordingly!!

And what should happen to this type of traitor?:

Sayanim
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump to: navigation, search
Sayanim (sing. Sayan; Hebrew: helpers, assistants) refers to Diaspora Jews who provide assistance to the Mossad.[1] Gordon Thomas estimates that in the United States and Britain, there are at least 20,000 sayanim who aid Israel's intelligence agencies in a number of ways.[2]

Generally-speaking, these non-Israeli Jewish volunteers are asked to engage in legal activities that will not bring them into trouble with the authorities. There are exceptions, however, as for example in the case of Jonathan Pollard, the U.S. Naval intelligence employee who engaged in espionage on behalf of Israel's intelligence agencies and whose exposure by the FBI strained relations between the U.S. and Israel.[3]

Parky,

Sorry, but there is no way I could have profited from those wars. I'm neither American nor Israeli. Nor a banker (you somehow managed to get that word wrong).
And for the "truth" going out: Sorry, your message has and will be ignored for years. Because most people know it is not based on facts.

This is the trouble with conspiracy theorists. The game is ALWAYS just about over. The big revolution / revelation is ALWAYS just out of reach. It's really no different from the Essenes of the first Century or messianic cults.

ETA - or any other faith-based belief system. I think it was Mark Roberts Ryan Mackey who I first saw write "he didn't arrive at this position by reason, therefore he can't be reasoned out of it."
 
 
 
Since Israel isn't an enemy, and there is no attempt to overthrow the US Government, there is no treason.

 
In other words you condone foreign spies who are surveiling US government installations including Military, DEA, and local law enforcement agencies....Hmmmm, are you a part of this Sayinim program?

Seriously, the term Cohort is a term used in sociology to refer to people of a similiar social background. But the guy misuses it.

Stero types are not funny!

I don't recall ever meeting a 911 truther who believed that "Da Joos did 911". I am aware there are some ignorant Jew haters that blame it all on them, but I am not, nor have I personally met any.

For the 4th time....Page 1, post #6....

I believe that there are definitely extremist fundementalist Muslims that have been involved in terrorist acts for decades......The same can be said of some fundementalist Christians in the US....Are you aware that there are also Jewish Zionist extremists supported and funded by the US and the State of Israel that are responsible for numerous acts of terrorism and espionage throughout the world since before the State Of Israel existed? Some of these arrogant maniacs actually believe that just by being Jewish they are chosen by God to reign over others, much like Nazis and KKK members. Also they have a large nuclear arsenal. Quite alarming, I'd say...
 
 
 
Ladies and gentlemen, the strawman logical fallacy. Not an argument.

 
Nor is it an argument to sumarily dismiss any evidence or information you don't happen to agree with as "crap"...For example this piece:  http://www.cassiopaea.org/cass/globemovers.htm 

Which is sourced and qualified by different publications from here to Jeruselem...I, along with most others I have corrasponded with who have actually read it, feel that it contains ample "Evidence" of Iraeli involvement in and around the 911 attacks, and the coverup thereafter. You, on the other hand may see this same information and see nothing out of the ordinary. I disagree with you regarding this. Understand??
 
 
 
Nor is it an argument to summarily dismiss any evidence or information you don't happen to agree with as "crap"...

 
is it a legitimate argument to ask people if they are a member of an foreign intelligence service, due to their views and opinions?

So, in a word, 'yes.' Thank you for reminding me.
 
 
Before the 911 Attacks, this was an assessment by a US intel agent:

On September 10, 2001, the Army School of Advanced Military Studies issued a report written by elite US army officers, which was made public just prior to 9/11. The report gave the following description for the Mossad: "Wildcard. Ruthless and cunning. Has capability to target US forces and make it look like a Palestinian/Arab act." [Washington Times, 9/10/01
Were these elite US Army officers "ANTI-SEMITES"?

What does this official report printed in a major US paper seem to suggest????? Anyone.....Anyone....Anyone....???
 
 
 
is it a legitimate argument to ask people if they are a member of an foreign intelligence service, due to their views and opinions?

 
It is not an argument to ask that or any question...I just asked a question. Why don't you answer it. It is not that complicated.

U.S. troops would enforce peace under Army study
by Rowan Scarborough - The Washington Times September 10, 2001
(Article ID: U00682760115:

"An elite U.S. Army study center has devised a plan for enforcing a major Israeli-Palestinian peace accord that would require about 20,000 well-armed troops stationed throughout Israel and a newly created Palestinian state.

There are no plans by the Bush administration to put American soldiers into the Middle East to police an agreement forged by the longtime warring parties. In fact, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld is searching for ways to reduce U.S. peacekeeping efforts abroad, rather than increasing such missions.

But a 68-page paper by the Army School of Advanced Military Studies (SAMS) does provide a look at the daunting task any international peacekeeping force would face if the United Nations authorized it, and Israel and the Palestinians ever reached a peace agreement. Located at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., the School for Advanced Military Studies is both a training ground and a think tank for some of the Army's brightest officers. Officials say the Army chief of staff, and sometimes the Joint Chiefs of Staff, ask SAMS to develop contingency plans for future military operations. During the 1991 Persian Gulf war, SAMS personnel helped plan the coalition ground attack that avoided a strike up the middle of Iraqi positions and instead executed a "left hook" that routed the enemy in 100 hours.

The cover page for the recent SAMS project said it was done for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. But Maj. Chris Garver, a Fort Leavenworth spokesman, said the study was not requested by Washington.

"This was just an academic exercise," said Maj. Garver. "They were trying to take a current situation and get some training out of it."

The exercise was done by 60 officers dubbed "Jedi Knights," as all second-year SAMS students are nicknamed.

The SAMS paper attempts to predict events in the first year of a peace-enforcement operation, and sees possible dangers for U.S. troops from both sides.

It calls Israel's armed forces a "500-pound gorilla in Israel. Well armed and trained. Operates in both Gaza and the West Bank. Known to disregard international law to accomplish mission. Very unlikely to fire on American forces. Fratricide a concern especially in air space management."

Of the MOSSAD, the Israeli intelligence service, the SAMS officers say: "Wildcard. Ruthless and cunning. Has capability to target U.S. forces and make it look like a Palestinian/Arab act."

Let me guess your response:

If you can't directly link it through the net right now, it is nothing but anti-semitic hate speech....But as always, the TRUTH is, it was printed as written by Scarborough on 9-10-01 in the Washington Times....You guys can just keep pretending that it wasn't and hope nobody notices what a pack of weak pointless "debunkers" you truly are....
 
 
 
Are you a member of Aryan Nations or any Ku Klux Klan organizations?

 
No I am not. In fact I despise those groups.

See how easy it is just to answer the question directly? Try it sometime.

I posted the link earlier on this page....Apparently, you just didn't bother to read it..The quote is from the Washington Times, 9-10-01. What more do you need regarding this? Pick up a copy. I'm sure they'll mail you one...Give em a call.
 
 
 
Of the MOSSAD, the Israeli intelligence service, the SAMS officers say: "Wildcard. Ruthless and cunning. Has capability to target U.S. forces and make it look like a Palestinian/Arab act."

 
Capability equals the willingness to do something? And to go further, the obligatory use of that capability?
I am capable of doing myself physical harm, that doesn't mean that I'm willing to do it nor that I will do it.
 
 
 
I posted the link earlier on this page...

 
Ugh. It was way down at the bottom of that  http://www.cassiopaea.org  link. Which was nothing more than a bunch of dots that didn't need connecting. Your "source," on that page, gives equal credence to Jane's Defense Digest as they do to "whatreallyhappened.com." Is there no one you read who exhibits critical thought?

Does that change the FACT that this article was written on 9-10-01 in the Washington Times by Rowan Scarborough? What exactly is it that you are trying to say here?

Are you also a cunning ruthless wildcard....Because that seems to indicate that these people are not very dependable allies, and that they might attack the US and try to blame it on Arabs or Palistinians..To me, this along with the police reports from NJ regarding Israelis who were arrested and later found to be Mossad agents who were celebrating the murder of 3000 Americans, then told the police that Palistinians did it and countless other items is evidence of possible Israeli involvement in the attacks..But I do give you credit for at least admitting the OBVIOUS FACT that this article was written. Thanks
 
 
 
No I am not. In fact I despise those groups..

 
if you say so...

#1. 3,000 Americans were not killed on 9-11. Your
research sucks big time.

#2. The Israelis pulled over in the van did NOT say "The
Palestinians did it". Again, your research on this
subject is pathetic.

Where did you learn to do research?

I'm trying to say that my only source for this "fact" is a bat-crap crazy article that draws a bunch of conclusions from a myriad of sources, not all of which are based on reality (e.g., whatreallyhappened.com). Sorry. You just don't seem capable of separating the wheat from the chaff.

Plus, as noted, the article says that the Mossad are 'capable' of doing something. If SAMS really wrote that study, maybe they were jealous and suggesting that our guys develop the same capability. It doesn't mean that the Mossad did anything at all.

are you sure about that?

 

I am postive that I do not now, nor have I ever belonged to the Aryan Brotherhood, the KKK or any other such organization. I am also positive that I despise both of these organizations and their hateful, racist beliefs in general.

That is what is known as a direct answer. Why do you always evade answering my direct questions? Generally, you either ignore them and ask another, or come back with a non responsive and rather snotty comment..Is this some advanced debunking system? I must advise you that it is very transparent and ineffective.

if we assume israel was involved, and if we assume the israelis in the van were mossad agents and thus intimately aware of such involvement, why would they blame palestine? didnt they get the memo that the scapegoat was to be al qeada? seems to be evidence AGAINST their involvement if you ask me

Or perhaps they were arrogant, stupid low level operatives who blew the deal for the perps...I am greatful for them as are very much responsible for blowing the lid off this whole fiasco within hours after the attacks while the fragmented bodies of those murdered were still warm. I'd call it some sort of divine providence that these aholes were apprehended, as it led directly to this brilliant peice of journilism from of all places Fox News,

Of course it was immediately sanitized from their website and archives but thanks to tivo and the net, it will live forever..While the rest of America was eating up the Osama and the 19 Dwarves crap and were led blindly into two useless bloody, murderous conflicts,a world wide group of brilliant dilligent and courageous independent investigators went to work and have totally exposed who was not only behind 911 but most of the murder and mayhem of the last century...The clip I posted is one of a series of 10. If you would like to know what is going on in the world, I suggest that you watch these clips and follow up on the links...Watch for some more attempts at false flag in Vancouver in late January..They will most likely FAIL, because of those in Canada who are loudly protesting about this mossad front providing security at the Vancouver Airport right now.

Thanks

Now that's a great prediction. The attacks will fail because of protests? What? How does that work? Who is protesting this "mossad front" and where?

Then, when no attacks materialize in Vancouver, your response will be to admit that you were wrong that the Canadian protests caused the bad actors to pull back in fear of the "protestors?"

That is some tortured logic you have there.

Right you are.

notice the creative spelling of Israel:

"The Israeli Intel front company Verint is doing security in Calgary (YYC) and Vancouver (YVR) International airports. The company is famous for putting back-doors in its software, which phones home to Isr-el. The company is suspected with facilitating the 9/11 attacks, and the 7/7"

The software calls home. Isn't that cute. Wonder if it hits Dad up for money?

"Besides, the average Canadian is a Zionist tool and deserves to be abused. the more the better for now I suppose.

Any comments on Camerons excellent piece that totally exposed the criminal terrorist network based in Israel that has been hard at work subverting the US Government? Was it an "anti-semitic" attack? LOL

Did you watch the 10 part series with the young Canadians confronting their elected leaders regarding inviting this criminal virus "Verint" into their country to be paid by the taxpayers? That is PRICELESS!! And it is happening ALL over the world, even here in the US, the dumbed down masses are waking up exponentially every day. I can feel the slimes squirming in their boardrooms and hideaways as we sit here and exchange these ideas. There are too many of us and there is not a damn thing they can do about it, as now THEY are the hunted. I, and countless others are letting our elected representitives know that we are aware of exactly what is going on here in America and around the world every day...Via email, FAX, Phone, and US Mail...And we are not going to go away...So keep on debunkin...I really enjoy your transparent weak and ineffective tactics...I gives me comfort to know that this is the best you got...Thanks

Here's a great 7 minute piece showing the direct conection between Verint and the London 7-7 false flag attack...It just keeps getting better....

Hume: Carl, is there any reason to suspect that the Israeli government is involved?
Cameron: No, there's not.

Israeli organized crime hacks into a data system.

Therefore, the Mossad did 9/11 is, as I said earlier, quite the leap of logic. But, keep on truckin' - sheeple are awakening, etc.

In other words you condone foreign spies who are surveiling US government installations including Military, DEA, and local law enforcement agencies....Hmmmm, are you a part of this Sayinim program?

 
The most fundamental right given to Americans under Constitutional law -- even more basic than the bill of rights -- is the right not to be charged with treason unless you have taken specific actions against the government. The founding fathers obviously found it very important to protect citizens from being charged with treason simply because someone in power didn't like them.
 
 
Treason, as defined by the US Constitution:

 
Section 3. Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort.

 
Pretty sure declaring open rebellion against US gov't meets that first criteria. So, who is really the traitor here?

Your answer is non responsive. Are you another obfuscater who answers questions with questions? You intimated that I was calling for open rebellion against the US government. Can you cite the evidence?

Now I will answer your question. I will continue to expose the fact that the US government is rife with agents of foreign and domestic criminal organizations to everyone I can possibly reach. Also, I vow to support those legal forces and organizations that are led by men who are true to their oath "to protect and defend the US Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic". Like any good American.

My question to you is: How does a self proclaimed ex militia patriot end up here sucking up to, and defending these criminal entities? Did you get in a little trouble and sell out to the crooked Feds for a few bucks? What's the dealio?

That's right. The Feds came to me and offered to pay me to post pro-gov't stuff on an obscure website about skepticism. To no one else but you would that make any sense.

Or, more likely, I saw my political statement taken over by nuts and kooks who went and blew up a building after we'd already won and have been highly critical of, if amused by, such nuts and kooks ever since.

This is just a message board, dude. It's not part of some vast, government conspiracy. If I was trying to "suck up and defend" criminal entities, there are a hell of a lot better places I could go.

Not necessesarily. But your constant insistance on ignoring the REAL threat regarding foreign agents undermining US legal authorities as it pertains to Israeli spying and terrorist activity here in America, indicates that you may be mezmorized by the mind numbing propaganda spewed forward daily in the main stream media.
 
 
 
I believe that there are definitely extremist fundementalist Muslims that have been involved in terrorist acts for decades......The same can be said of some fundementalist Christians in the US....Are you aware that there are also Jewish Zionist extremists supported and funded by the US and the State of Israel that are responsible for numerous acts of terrorism and espionage throughout the world since before the State Of Israel existed? Some of these arrogant maniacs actually believe that just by being Jewish they are chosen by God to reign over others, much like Nazis and KKK members. Also they have a large nuclear arsenal. Quite alarming, I'd say...

 

 
Muslim terrorists don't exist. They are all crypto-Jews. Remember this pic?

I'm sure that many, though certainly not all (as I clearly stated in post #6 of this thread) so called "Muslim terrorists" are really zionist agents disguised as Arabs or "Muslim" agents working for Mossad. Research the King David Hotel murders, and the Lavon Affair, or the numerous recent PLO type terrorists, who turned out upon further review to be working with Mossad. This false flag type of attack has been used by Israel and the Mossad since their inceptions. It is and always has always been their MO. Thanks
 
 
Uh, you're saying that the King David Hotel bombing of 1946 was a false flag attack? wtf?

The King David murders were not necessarily false flag, but the attack was certainly the typical sneaky, underhanded, chicken**** and murderous act that we have all come to expect from this bunch. What is even more disgusting is the annual celebration that is held by these criminals to this day commerating this cowardly terrorist act. It is also very telling that some of the key players were later elected to the highest government positions of this criminal terrorist state. Thanks

I don't watch cable news. I don't even watch local news. I can't be mesmerized by something I don't even consume, can I?

Regarding foreign agents undermining US legal authorities, are you getting back to noahide courts or something? Because you haven't proven a single thing in this extensive thread-full-of-opportunity-to-do-so. Just a bunch of accusations and innuendo, mostly repeated verbatim from your fellow traveler dot-connector paranoiacs.

Trojan Horse

How Israeli Backdoor Technology Penetrated the US Government's Telecom System and Compromised National Security
by Christopher Ketcham

Excerpt:

"According to former CIA officer Giraldi and other US intelligence sources, software manufactured and maintained by Verint, Inc. handles most of American law enforcement's wiretaps. Says Giraldi: "Phone calls are intercepted, recorded, and transmitted to US investigators by Verint, which claims that it has to be ‘hands on' with its equipment to maintain the system." Giraldi also notes Verint is reimbursed for up to 50 percent of its R&D costs by the Israeli Ministry of Industry and Trade. According to Giraldi, the extent of the use of Verint technology "is considered classified," but sources have spoken out and told Giraldi they are worried about the security of Verint wiretap systems. The key concern, says Giraldi, is the issue of a "trojan" embedded in the software.

A Trojan in information security hardware/software is a backdoor that can be accessed remotely by parties who normally would not have access to the secure system. Allegations of massive Trojan spying have rocked the Israeli business community in recent years. An AP article in 2005 noted, "Top Israeli blue chip companies…are suspected of using illicit surveillance software to steal information from their rivals and enemies." Over 40 companies have come under scrutiny. "It is the largest cybercrime case in Israeli history," Boaz Guttmann, a veteran cybercrimes investigator with the Israeli national police, tells me. "Trojan horse espionage is part of the way of life of companies in Israel. It's a culture of spying."

Verint appears to be involved in covering up the video tapes in the 7-7 London bombings, and the Israeli owned ICTS appears to be complicit in the cover-up of the 911 attacks...No video of the train tunnels on 7-7 or the boarding gates on 911. Go figure???

Do you want sleazy, foreign companies like this monitoring our communiction systems or being responsible in any way for airport or subway security? I sure the hell don't.

True there was some video in the tunnels, however just like the boarding gate video at all airports allegedly used by Arab terrorists on 911 which haven't been produced by Israeli owned ICTS, the critical cameras on 7-7 in London were not functional at the time of the murders. Thanks

 http://jewishterrorism.blogspot.com/...terrorist.html 

Excerpt:

"Serious concerns remain about the lack of London Underground CCTV images of the London Bombers on 7th July itself, as opposed to those published of a dummy run of the bombing suspects two weeks earlier. Also an exercise on 7/7 by Visor Consultants with imaginary bombs at the exact four locations where the real bombs went off has raised more questions than it has answered.

Also to be considered is the vanishing CCTV footage from Stockwell Underground Station of the moments leading up to the killing of Brazilian Electrician Jean Charles De Menezes. LU staff handed checked and correct CCTV tapes over to the Metropolitan Police but were later told there was nothing on them."

Yes, and we were attacked by our supposed allies in Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan with inside help from the dozens of traitors within our own government. We should "go after" these people by any and all means necessary. Instead, up to this point we have illegally invaded and are now occupying two soverign countries and installed puppet regimes. Also, we have murdered over a million innocents, got 30,000 of our young men killed and maimed and wasted trillions in money and rescources. We are on the wrong track. Thanks

Fonebone < FiRST, A DEFINITION OF "FALSE FLAG attack---
 http://www.wanttoknow.info/falseflag 
So, What makes the KING DAVID HOTEL BOMBING a FALSE FLAG TERRORIST ATTACK ?
THIS !
King David Hotel bombing  WP 
Disguised as Arabs, Irgunists planted a bomb in the basement of the main building
of the hotel, under the wing which housed the Mandate Secretariat and part of the
British military headquarters.

i Yes I do respect the American justice system and a black civil rights worker in Mississippi or an Arab/Muslum in New York could expect
a fair and balanced show trial conducted by hand-picked judges selected
to ensure the desired verdict.
In the WTC 1993 bombing the hand picked judges were nice Jewish boys
and in Mississippi the hand picked judges were respectable Christians.

OH - And you did request evidence--
 http://takingaimradio.com/articles/permanentwar.html 
< excerpts >
"The hands of the FBI and of the Mossad were all over the bombing
of the World Trade Center in 1993."
and
"It was later established that the person who secured the rental van and organized the
apartment where the preparations (for the 1993 WTC bombing occurred was a
Mossad operative named Guzie Hadas."
 http://911review.org/Wiki/FirstWTCBombing.shtml 
<excerpt>
According to one source this terrorist attack was initiated by a Josie - or Guzie - Hadas,
an Islamist, who, according to the International Herald Tribune, was
"long established as a Mossad operative." 1
She had hired 2 Arabs, who were later arrested,
Mohammed Salameh, a Palestinian, and Nidal Ayyad.

 

King David hotel
Lavon affait
WTC 1993 bombing

Hey Fonebone, you were going to scan that Newsweek article for us. Any progress?
 
 
 
Really? When?

So we should nuke Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan?

 

On 9-11-01...

As soon as humanly possible.

No, I don't think we should "nuke" anyone.

No, when did this attack occur?

Nuking a country, such as we did in Japan, would most likely result in many more innocent bystanders being killed...I, (along with any other sane individual) certainly don't approve of that.

Fonebone, aren't you aware that pointing out any of these attacks makes you a "racist" and an "anti-semite" according to our jref army of ADL storm troopers here? Shame on you!! LOL
 
 
So, according to jmh423, on 11-September, 2001, We were " attacked by our supposed allies in Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan with inside help from the dozens of traitors within our own government."

The gents from Saudi, Yemen, UAE, etc. hijacked the planes and did the damage. Could you possibly post a little evidence of the "dozens of traitors?"

Wait, no. On second thought, we are going to get caught up with you posting more articles and such.

Please, jmh423, post ONE such traitor. Name the traitor within our government that gave inside help to the Saudi, Israeli, Pakistani terrorists that attacked us on 9/11/01.

Thanks in advance.

Hey Fonebone, you were going to scan that Newsweek article for us. Any progress?

 
Yes I did Carlito- The Newsweek magizine came in the mail yesterday-
i don't have a scanner but I did take a picture of the page with a digital camera but the image was blurred and was over a meg in size.

I can email it to you before we start because the words are ledgible and
the article is extremely germain to this thread.
 
 
Fonebone, looking at the Newsweek magazine, could you please confirm on which page this quote appears?

"Katya and Sayanin: A Katya is a Jewish spy. The Sayanin are those Jews resident in the host nation who provide support and assistance to the spies in their missions. In 1979 an ex-CIA official said "Mossad can go to any distinguished American Jew and ask for help."

Excerpt:

'Al Qaeda', as its known, is the so called master Islamic terrorist group of the 21st century that nobody has ever seen or heard. This infamous group -- supposedly directed from a cave by an old Saudi born millionaire on kidney dialosis, Osama Bin Laden -- has been blamed for countless acts of terror and has been 'officially' credited with effortlessly defeating the most sophisticated security and intelligence apparatus in the entire world; that of the USA on 9/11. Yet how is it that this group seems to always evade authorities and remove all evidence of wrong doing before authorities can get their hands on it to actually be able to prove the existence of this ominous group? All we've ever seen of this group is what we've been shown on television. The replaying of old archive footage of Bin Laden and other cave-dwellers roaming the desolate mountain regions of Afghanistan does not constitute as proof. What reason do you have to believe that this far reaching and elusive group actually exists and is capable of such remarkable feats? Does it even exist? Or is it simply a front operation being used as misdirection for the benefit of a more devious criminal network that lurks in the shadows? I have reason to believe that this so called terrorist group is a mere INVENTION of imaginative Zionists of the Hollywood persuasion.Yes that's right, Al Qaeda is Zionist fiction; a facetious fairy tale! I will quickly run through the reasons why I think this is.

Reason #1; Is 'Al Qaeda' a Fitting Name for a Terror Group?

The widely known translation of 'Al Qaeda', sometimes spelled 'Al Qaida', is 'The Base'. However, this is not the only translation of the ominous term. There is another. "Ana raicha Al Qaeda" is colloquial for "I'm going to the toilet". A very common and widespread use of the word "Al-Qaeda" in different Arab countries in the public language is for the toilet bowl. This name comes from the Arabic verb "Qa'ada" which mean "to sit", pertinently, on the "Toilet Bowl". In most Arabs homes there are two kinds of toilets: "Al-Qaeda" also called the "Hamam Franji" or foreign toilet, and "Hamam Arabi" or "Arab toilet" which is a hole in the ground. Lest we forget it, the potty used by small children is called "Ma Qa'adia" or "Little Qaeda". Why would a terrorist group call itself 'The Toilet'? Did Osama really choose to name his terror network after potty humor?

Reason #2; 'Al Qaeda' = Creation of American, Israeli and Saudi Intelligence

The real origins of what has now 'officially' been deemed "Al Qaeda" did not stem from radical Islamists who took their interpretation of the Qur'an a little too seriously, but was actually a creation of the American CIA, the Saudis, and some have said the Israeli Mossad as well. Former British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook told the House of Commons that "Al Qaeda" is not really a terrorist group but a database of international mujaheddin and arms smugglers used by the CIA and Saudis to funnel guerrillas, arms, and money into Soviet-occupied Afghanistan in the late 70's early 80's. A few weeks later Robin Cook abruptly died of a "heart attack". Hmmm. Former French Military Intelligence official Pierre Henry Bunel expanded on this noting that "Al-Qaeda," was an early form of intranet, which was used by Islamic nations and influential families to communicate with each other. It was also used by the "American agent," Osama bin Laden to send coded or covert messages back to his CIA handlers from Afghanistan. [#] This concept is so mainstream nowadays that even the BBC aired a movie which admits Al Qaeda is nothing but propaganda."

At about 6:49 minutes, there is footage of the late Tim Russert talking to Donald Rumsfeld about some really neat super terror condos built by these fiendish swarthy Arabs. I remember seeing it in real time the Sunday after the attacks and rolling around on the floor laughing and wondering how many gullible morons were taking it seriously. Rummy could barely keep a straight face. Have you seen this footage yet? I highly recommend it for entertainment purposes. Please get back to me after watching it. "Is he a warrior? Is he a preacher? Is he a politician?...LOL...This is priceless stuff mate. Thanks

My father fought in WWII in the Pacific as an engineer gunner on a B-25 for three years and he told me about his experiences there. Just before he died in 2004 he made a film at the Van Nuys airport with a B-25 which is now in the library of congress. Two of his brothers were involved in the Normandy Invasion...One died on Omaha Beach and the other was a paratrooper in the 101st who eventully made it all the way to Berlin. He told me about his first hand experiences.

Do you believe in the super deluxe terror condos that Rummy was selling us on Meet the press? How much do you think a 15000 sq ft 5 story condo would go for in the Khyber Pass these days?

Former High-Ranking Intelligence Officer: Cheney Responsible for 9/11

David Steele is a former 20-year Marine Corps infantry and intelligence officer, the second-ranking civilian in U.S. Marine Corps Intelligence, and former CIA clandestine services case officer.

Steele has previously written that "9/11 was at a minimum allowed to happen as a pretext for war".

This month, Steele went further, writing:

Pakistan briefed Cheney [about the plans for the terrorist attacks ahead of time] nations also got wind of this and warned the CIA. We also had two walk-ins to the FBI, one in Orlando, one in Newark, that were dismissed by the FBI because the names were all virgins and not in the FBI data basethe arrogance of stupid bureaucracy.

Cheney saw an opportunity for what Bush called his trifecta, and gave it to him by giving the go-ahead to ISI and Al Qaeda, and ordering up a terrorism exercise that allowed him to send all relevant close-in air defense strip alert craft away from the target areas, and to disable the NORTHCOM normal response to flight path diversion.

While the details might be open to debate, many other very high-level intelligence officers have said the "official" explanation for 9/11 makes no sense."

Hmmm... My (web namesake) Grand father was a Tuskegee Airman and My actual grandfather was in the 761st. Also my cousin worked at WTC 2, and none of the survivors she worked with think there is any evidence of and "inside job". Why should I believe you over them?

 
Do you believe in the super deluxe terror condos that Rummy was selling us on Meet the press? How much do you think a 15000 sq ft 5 story condo would go for in the Khyber Pass these days?

 
I've seen no evidence of that either. Also, none of that means that we were attacked by the CIA, Mossad, or jewninjas. What's your point?

My point is, that the evidence points to the fact that they and you are wrong.
My point is, 9/11 happened because some Muslims got pissed off at us for a myriad of reasons and we figured that no one would have the balls to do something like that so we were sloppy.
My point is, truther's arguments always boil down to "how do you really know" and few of us were around for WWII.

Let's see how that turns out...

It's a joke. A parody of CTers ability to deny the existance of something so profoundly well documented that denial is ridiculous. However, I realize that the existance of Poe's Law may make some people take it seriously.

Never played paintball. The militia thing was like 15 years ago and mostly consisted of going to the range, shooting a whole bunch of ammo, and bitching about politics. Nope, no meth lab either, so if you want to find a connection, you'll have to look elsewhere.

That shot was easy to call after the New Orleans game a couple weeks ago, champ. Also I am happy any time Bill Beli cheat and company get their butts humiliated in front of their own fans like today. I really enjoyed the game this morning...Thanks for bringing it up.

Relax Rogue, we all believe you, and I was just kidding. Are you sure there was no meth lab? LOL

But here's a little hint. Whenever someone uses the term CTer, he gives away the fact that he knows nothing about the nature of crime in general. The FACT is that your theory of 911 is a CT. Over half of the prosecutions for major crimes worldwide and especially in the US because of the statutory nature of our laws are prosecuted using "conspiracy theories" advanced by the US Attorney, The District Attorney, or States Attorney...When major crimes are committed, conspiracy is the rule rather than the exception. CT is just another deceptive buzzword aimed at, and used to, discredit anyone who dares to challenge the official explaination for shady behavior by powerful entities. If you believe in Osama Bin Laden and the 19 dwarves you are in FACT a conspiracy theorist....Understand?

- "The Second Coming" by William Butler Yeats

Conspiracy Theorists seem to take this line by Yeats to heart and take the sentiment to its illogical conclusion. That all people can be split up into two unambiguous camps; oppressed/oppressor or truth tellers/liars or simply good/evil. If one person is evil it logically follows that anyone who opposes that evil person must by definition be good. Since they are so "good" (or at least so ineffectual) they would never commit an evil act against their evil oppressor. This is why Truthers go to such laughably absurd lengths to cobble together counter-explanations for say, 9/11:

"What's that? The Government says Islamic Terrorists were the perpetrators? That must mean Islamic Terrorists had nothing to do with it!"

"The Government says jets were used? That means jets played no part in the attacks and it must have been bombs, missiles or death rays!"

"The Government says that the attacks occurred on September 11th, 2001? That means that they must have occurred on some other da- (puts hand to earpiece), I'm sorry I'm now being told by someone who was actually an adult in 2001 that the attacks did in fact happen on that date. OK, (grumble) we'll give them that one."

And they say that a debunkers' view of the world is naive and simplistic

OK Carlitos Newsweek /september 3, 1979 page 23 titled
" Israel's spies in the U.S. "
<excerpt >" They have penetrations all through the U.S. government. They do better than the KGB " says one U.S intelligence expert With the help of
American jews in and out of governmemt, Mossad looks for any softening in U.S. support, and tries to get any technical intelligence the Administration unwilling to give to Israel "
" Mossad can go to any distinguished American Jew and ask for his
help,"says a former CIA agent. The appeal is a simple one :
when the call went out and no one heeded it, the Holocaust resulted."

The article is bi-lined by Bob Levin & DAVID c. Martin

 
Congratulations Fonebone. You just showed exponentially greater research skills and initiative than any other truther / CT believer that I have debated online. I applaud the effort. So, we know that the highlighted phrase was uttered by a former CIA agent. Thank you. I may go dig up that Ostrovsky book again one day soon.

I didn't get a chance to go find jmh's other source. Apologies - painting the ceilings.

 
David Steele is a former 20-year Marine Corps infantry and intelligence officer, the second-ranking civilian in U.S. Marine Corps Intelligence, and former CIA clandestine services case officer.

 
Appeal to authority noted.

 
Steele has previously written that "9/11 was at a minimum allowed to happen as a pretext for war".

This month, Steele went further, writing:

Pakistan briefed Cheney [about the plans for the terrorist attacks ahead of time] …nations also got wind of this and warned the CIA. We also had two walk-ins to the FBI, one in Orlando, one in Newark, that were dismissed by the FBI because the names were all virgins and not in the FBI data base—the arrogance of stupid bureaucracy.

Cheney saw an opportunity for what Bush called his trifecta, and gave it to him by giving the go-ahead to ISI and Al Qaeda, and ordering up a terrorism exercise that allowed him to send all relevant close-in air defense strip alert craft away from the target areas, and to disable the NORTHCOM normal response to flight path diversion.

While the details might be open to debate, many other very high-level intelligence officers have said the "official" explanation for 9/11 makes no sense. "

 
Bull.
 
 
Does JMH423 still believe that 3,000 Americans died on 9-11?

does he still believe the Israelis in the white van said "the Palestinians did it"?

 
 
 
 
"Many other survivors of WTC, and relatives of the dead believe there was an inside job, I have talked to several of them...Why should I believe you over them? What's yourpoint?"

If you believe the story of Osama Bin Laden and the 19 Dwarves YOU are a Conspiracy Theorist, just as those who have advanced that ridiculous "conspiracy theory". I wonder what Yeats would have to say about that? Get yourself a dictionary and find out the definitions of conspiracy, and then theory. Is English your first language? :rolleyes???..lol... Thanks

"Here's a little hint. Whenever someone uses the term CTer, he gives away the fact that he knows nothing about the nature of crime in general. The FACT is that your theory of 911 is a CT. Over half of the prosecutions for major crimes worldwide and especially in the US because of the statutory nature of our laws are prosecuted using "conspiracy theories" advanced by the US Attorney, The District Attorney, or States Attorney...When major crimes are committed, conspiracy is the rule rather than the exception. CT is just another deceptive buzzword aimed at, and misused to, discredit anyone who dares to challenge the official explaination for shady behavior by powerful entities. If you believe in Osama Bin Laden and the 19 dwarves you are in FACT a conspiracy theorist....Understand?"
 
 
 
Does JMH423 still believe that 3,000 Americans died on 9-11?

Close to 3000 Americans died on 911. I can not name all of them....

The NJ Highway Patrolman related that one of the Israeli spies with the boxcutters in his pocket and $4500 cash stuffed in his socks said that he was told: "We are Israelis, we are not your problem, the Palistinians are your problem...You are NITPICKING again sporto..

hmmm...you spoke to 10 people. maybe even 20...who think 9-11 was an inside job.

possibly 20,000 people escaped towers 1 and 2.

there are possibly 30,000 victim's relatives.

but you are convinced that 9-11 was an inside job, cause you spoke to 20 people. wow.

convinced easily huh? sure seems that way. find 20 people who confirm your pre-conceived notion of truth, and you will believe ay?

nice. a true skeptic.

Ah, that old chestnut. Do you really think that splitting hairs is in any way helpful or meaningful? I suppose if I hadn't used that term you would have taken the rest of my post seriously? I can almost hear you thinking to yourself "****, what he's saying makes sense but I don't know how to respond to it. Maybe if I latch onto some pedantic quibble over his post I can trick everyone into thinking I actually addressed his points". I use the term "Conspiracy Theory" in the commonly accepted definition as seen here from Wikipedia (Emphasis mine):

Conspiracy theory is a term that originally was a neutral descriptor for any claim of civil, criminal or political conspiracy. However, it has come almost exclusively to refer to any fringe theory which explains a historical or current event as the result of a secret plot by conspirators of almost superhuman power and cunning.

Can you please tell me why anyone over the age of 10 would consider "Osama Bin Laden and the 19 Dwarves" clever?

Another strong, concise, pointed argument from Carlitos...Thanks buddy

 
You really don't deserve much more. Your source is wrong. Dick Cheney was not in charge of NORAD, and had no authority to " end all relevant close-in air defense strip alert craft away from the target areas, and to disable the NORTHCOM normal response to flight path diversion."

 Here is the original source  for this canard.

 
In May of 2001, by presidential order, Cheney was handed direct control of all wargame and drill operations. This meant he was solely in charge of the overlapping NORAD drills and wargames on the morning of 9/11, that prevented Standard Operating Procedure from being implemented, and any of the hijacked planes being intercepted.

 
 Here is the relevant presidential order . It contains no reference to NORAD. The only reference to the DoD was pertaining to weapons of mass-destruction, not air defense.

 
Statement by the President
Domestic Preparedness Against Weapons of Mass Destruction

Protecting America's homeland and citizens from the threat of weapons of mass destruction is one of our Nation's important national security challenges. Today, more nations possess chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons than ever before. Still others seek to join them. Most troubling of all, the list of these countries includes some of the world's least-responsible states -- states for whom terror and blackmail are a way of life. Some non-state terrorist groups have also demonstrated an interest in acquiring weapons of mass destruction.

Against this backdrop, it is clear that the threat of chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons being used against the United States -- while not immediate -- is very real. That is why our Nation actively seeks to deny chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons to those seeking to acquire them. That is why, together with our allies, we seek to deter anyone who would contemplate their use. And that is also why we must ensure that our Nation is prepared to defend against the harm they can inflict.

Should our efforts to reduce the threat to our country from weapons of mass destruction be less than fully successful, prudence dictates that the United States be fully prepared to deal effectively with the consequences of such a weapon being used here on our soil.

Today, numerous Federal departments and agencies have programs to deal with the consequences of a potential use of a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapon in the United States. Many of these Federal programs offer training, planning, and assistance to state and local governments. But to maximize their effectiveness, these efforts need to be seamlessly integrated, harmonious, and comprehensive.

Therefore, I have asked Vice President Cheney to oversee the development of a coordinated national effort so that we may do the very best possible job of protecting our people from catastrophic harm. I have also asked Joe Allbaugh, the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to create an Office of National Preparedness. This Office will be responsible for implementing the results of those parts of the national effort overseen by Vice President Cheney that deal with consequence management. Specifically it will coordinate all Federal programs dealing with weapons of mass destruction consequence management within the Departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, Justice, and Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, and other federal agencies. The Office of National Preparedness will work closely with state and local governments to ensure their planning, training, and equipment needs are addressed. FEMA will also work closely with the Department of Justice, in its lead role for crisis management, to ensure that all facets of our response to the threat from weapons of mass destruction are coordinated and cohesive. I will periodically chair a meeting of the National Security Council to review these efforts.

No governmental responsibility is more fundamental than protecting the physical safety of our Nation and its citizens. In today's world, this obligation includes protection against the use of weapons of mass destruction. I look forward to working closely with Congress so that together we can meet this challenge.

 
There are many ex-CIA operatives who have bought into your worldview; their previous employment doesn't make them right, and they aren't special to me. Many times they "talk big" about stuff they had no exposure to while at the Agency (Shyam Sundar comes to mind).

So, when you post something written by David Steele 8 years after 9/11, and he is merely regurgitating long-debunked conspiracy theories, you really don't deserve more than "bull" from me. In this case, I made an exception. You're welcome.

My question is: How did a pair of words that are so simple "come almost exclusively to refer to any fringe theory"? Ponder on that a bit and see what you come up with.

Anti-semite is another one. In terms of the middle east conflicts, anti-semite would seem to indicate that those who invaded a semitic population and stole their land would be the "anti-semites", the Romans, the Turks, the Brits, the Irgun, the Likudis etc...Have the Palistinians suddenly lost their semitism, and if so when did that happen?

Another one that has sprung up in the last 30 or so years is Judeo-Christian..I grew up in the 50s and 60s and there weren't any "Judeo-Christians" then. I never even heard the term until the '80s when the right wing whack tele-preachers like Falwell and Hagee sprouted up in the US and started pounding that one home. Were'd that come from? Are there any Judeo-Muslims? Both claim to be the sons of Abraham and believe the old testament...hmmmm...

My point is: When I hear buzzwords like "conspiracy theorists" misused in a degrading way, or "anti-semite" misused to say the exact opposite of what it means, or Judeo-Christian misused to obviously pit Christians against Muslims, unlike those who are simply conditioned by clever buzzwords to think a certain way, I am automatically suspicious of what the possibly inadverdent buzzworder is trying to convey either wittingly or unwittingly.

I started thinking about such things directly after 911 when the whole country was inundated with the buzzphrase "War On Terror". This seemed like an incorrect use of the English language and very silly and stupid to say the least. Yet Harvard and Yale graduates throughout the US media were puking it out endlessly over the airwaves 24-7-365 and then normal, once intelligent people started repeating it as if it made sense. I find this phenomena facinating. What say you?

As far as studies showing that marajuana use is linked to paranioa: I haven't seen all the studies and I am sure that there are conflicting sides in this issue. However, I would concede that over use or abuse of any mind altering substance like caffiene, alcohol, nicotine, canibus, opiates or countless perscription drugs could lead to altered states of mind and paranoia certainly could result. That said, I am not an abuser of any of these substances. Thanks
 
 
This source seems helpful on the Judeo-Christian  WP  thingie. Looks like it goes back 110 years, but the American usage evolved in the 40's.

That was actually a reasonable post, even though you still steered clear of my main point (i.e., the ideological need to disbelieve EVERYTHING a certain group says can force one into believing ridiculous lies). I may not agree with all of the post but you stated it reasonably calmly and rationally, making it very hard for me to get snarky  . Keep it up and maybe we'll all learn something.

I've always thought the term "War on Terror" was pretty lame, too, though perhaps for different reasons. What you have to understand is that there are plenty of sincere people who have (to put it mildly) a low opinion of the Bush administration who nevertheless see no evidence that the USG was responsible for 9/11. There's plenty to criticize in the smorgasbord of lies, unjustified arrogance and general incompetence they offered us for eight years. You don't need to make stuff up about them. Nor do you have to believe they are bottomlessly evil. The same goes for any group. There's nothing wrong with being critical of Israel, either. Plenty of people of good will are. There's no need to turn them into super villains.

Finally, just because you have a "things that make you go hmmmmm...." moment, believing you've uncovered some sinister secret connection, doesn't automatically mean you actually have.

"anti-Semitism" does not mean "hatred of Semites" any more than calling someone a "Barbarian" is accusing someone of being from the Barbary coast, or calling someone a "Cretan" is accusing someone of being from Crete, or calling someone a "Phillistine" is accusing someone of being a descendant of the Aegean tribes that lived in ancient Gaza.

Unlicensed taxis in NYC are called "Gypsy cabs". does this name mean that they are all Roma from Central Europe?

When you accuse someone of going "Berzerk", are you saying they are acting like a member of the pre-Christian German tribe?

"Long debunked" is in the eye of the beholder. You, who apparently spend a great deal of your life "debunking", (for god only knows what reason), are obviously going to assert that any evidence linking Cheney, or anyone else but OBL and his swarthy bearded terrorfascists is: "BULL". No big surprise there...The article I posted is just the latest in thousands of links accusing Cheney of being complicit in the attacks. I'm with Steele, Bob Bowman, Guy Razer and millions of others world wide who believe that Cheney is a liar, a thief, a murderer and a terrorist...I like where I stand on this issue after reearching it for over eight years...I know that defending this Dick-h**d must be a full time job in itself. Good luck in your future endeavors...Thanks again

Patriots Question 911 Report

 http://patriotsquestion911.com/ 

Excerpt:

Lt. Col. Robert Bowman, PhD, U.S. Air Force (ret) – Director of Advanced Space Programs Development under Presidents Ford and Carter. U.S. Air Force fighter pilot with over 100 combat missions. (PhD in Aeronautics and Nuclear Engineering, Cal Tech). Former Head of the Department of Aeronautical Engineering and Assistant Dean at the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology. 22-year Air Force career. Also taught Mathematics and English at the University of Southern California, the University of Maryland, and Phillips University.
Member: Political Leaders for 9/11 Truth Association Statement:

"Scholars and professionals with various kinds of expertise---including architects, engineers, firefighters, intelligence officers, lawyers, medical professionals, military officers, philosophers, religious leaders, physical scientists, and pilots---have spoken out about radical discrepancies between the official account of the 9/11 attacks and what they, as independent researchers, have learned.

They have established beyond any reasonable doubt that the official account of 9/11 is false and that, therefore, the official “investigations” have really been cover-up operations.

Thus far, however, there has been no response from political leaders in Washington or, for that matter, in other capitals around the world. Our organization, Political Leaders for 9/11 Truth, has been formed to help bring about such a response.

We believe that the truth about 9/11 needs to be exposed now---not in 50 years as a footnote in the history books---so the policies that have been based on the Bush-Cheney administration’s interpretation of the 9/11 attacks can be changed.

We are, therefore, calling for a new, independent investigation of 9/11 that takes account of evidence that has been documented by independent researchers but thus far ignored by governments and the mainstream media."

Video 9/11/04: "A lot of these pieces of information, taken together, prove that the official story, the official conspiracy theory of 9/11 is a bunch of hogwash. It’s impossible. … There’s a second group of facts having to do with the cover up. … Taken together these things prove that high levels of our government don’t want us to know what happened and who’s responsible.…

Who gained from 9/11? Who covered up crucial information about 9/11? And who put out the patently false stories about 9/11 in the first place? When you take those three things together, I think the case is pretty clear that it’s highly placed individuals in the administration with all roads passing through Dick Cheney.
I think the very kindest thing that we can say about George W. Bush and all the people in the U.S. Government that have been involved in this massive cover-up, the very kindest thing we can say is that they were aware of impending attacks and let them happen. Now some people will say that’s much too kind, however even that is high treason and conspiracy to commit murder."

My question is: How did a pair of words that are so simple "come almost exclusively to refer to any fringe theory"? Ponder on that a bit and see what you come up with.

 
Because, unlike the legal cases you refer to, what are commonly known as "conspiracy theories" are never proven. Moon hoax, JFK, Protocols of the Elders of Zion, chemtrails, bigfoot, etc. All just theories.
 
 
 
"Long debunked" is in the eye of the beholder. You, who apparently spend a great deal of your life "debunking", (for god only knows what reason)

Who gained from 9/11? Who covered up crucial information about 9/11? And who put out the patently false stories about 9/11 in the first place?

 
Sorry Ricky, but you are gonna have to wait at least 50 years before there will be a 4th investigation into 9-11.

Finally, just because you have a "things that make you go hmmmmm...." moment, believing you've uncovered some sinister secret connection, doesn't automatically mean you actually have.

 
Thanks John

I don't have time to delve into all this right now but your points are recieved respectfully and I'll get back to you. Right now, 5 miles on the beach at noon....I hope the rest of you super debunkers enjoy the day in your cubicles...Onward and upward...Adios!!
 
 
Great. Now you have posted another person who believes something vague and nefarious about Dick Cheney. Robert Bowman. A man whose BS filter is so defective he is also a member of Captain Rob Balsamo's "Pilots for 9/11 Truth." Why do you think that a PhD makes people impervious to faulty logic?

So far, in your attempt to "prove" that Dick Cheney is a "traitor," you have posted one recycled, disproven canard and now a vague opinion statement. This proof, will it ever be forthcoming?
 
 
 
Relax Rogue, we all believe you, and I was just kidding. Are you sure there was no meth lab? LOL

 
Relax? I've had nothing but fun in this thread.

 
But here's a little hint. Whenever someone uses the term CTer, he gives away the fact that he knows nothing about the nature of crime in general. The FACT is that your theory of 911 is a CT. Over half of the prosecutions for major crimes worldwide and especially in the US because of the statutory nature of our laws are prosecuted using "conspiracy theories" advanced by the US Attorney, The District Attorney, or States Attorney...When major crimes are committed, conspiracy is the rule rather than the exception. CT is just another deceptive buzzword aimed at, and used to, discredit anyone who dares to challenge the official explaination for shady behavior by powerful entities. If you believe in Osama Bin Laden and the 19 dwarves you are in FACT a conspiracy theorist....Understand?

 
Semantics. "Conspiracy theory" means something when put together that transends the meaning of the individual words. If you don't like that, you need to take it up with the English language, not me.
 
 
 
I do feel that we should make a sincere and dilligent effort to remove agents of ALL terrorist groups from positions of power in the US government, military, and media.

 
Oh, hey! That's a good idea! Let's do that!
 
 
 
I do feel that we should make a sincere and diligent effort to remove agents of ALL terrorist groups from positions of power in the US government, military, and media.

 
Agreed. Anyone who is a member of the Mossad should be immediately removed from their position in the US govt. and the American media.
 
 
I just can't believe I never thought of it. It seems so obvious!
 
 
 
My question is: How did a pair of words that are so simple "come almost exclusively to refer to any fringe theory"? Ponder on that a bit and see what you come up with.

Anti-semite is another one. In terms of the middle east conflicts, anti-semite would seem to indicate that those who invaded a semitic population and stole their land would be the "anti-semites", the Romans, the Turks, the Brits, the Irgun, the Likudis etc...Have the Palistinians suddenly lost their semitism, and if so when did that happen?

Another one that has sprung up in the last 30 or so years is Judeo-Christian..I grew up in the 50s and 60s and there weren't any "Judeo-Christians" then. I never even heard the term until the '80s when the right wing whack tele-preachers like Falwell and Hagee sprouted up in the US and started pounding that one home. Were'd that come from? Are there any Judeo-Muslims? Both claim to be the sons of Abraham and believe the old testament...hmmmm...

My point is: When I hear buzzwords like "conspiracy theorists" misused in a degrading way, or "anti-semite" misused to say the exact opposite of what it means, or Judeo-Christian misused to obviously pit Christians against Muslims, unlike those who are simply conditioned by clever buzzwords to think a certain way, I am automatically suspicious of what the possibly inadverdent buzzworder is trying to convey either wittingly or unwittingly.

 
These are called "idioms", and are a common characteristic of all languages.

Interesting point from Mark Steyn regarding  Umar Farouk  :

 
What did the Pantybomber have a membership card in? Well, he was president of the Islamic Society of University College, London. Kafeel Ahmed, who died after driving a burning jeep into the concourse of Glasgow Airport, had been president of the Islamic Society of Queen's University, Belfast. Yassin Nassari, serving three years in jail for terrorism, was president of the Islamic Society of the University of Westminster. Waheed Arafat Khan, arrested in the 2006 Heathrow terror plots that led to Americans having to put their liquids and gels in those little plastic bags, was president of the Islamic Society of London Metropolitan University.

Unlike Wayne Madsen or the disgruntled ex-government types you have posted here, Mark Steyn usually bases his opinion pieces on proven facts. To illustrate:

 Farouk 

 
Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the alleged Detroit bomber, was president of University College London's Islamic society, according to a university spokesman.

 
 Ahmed 

 
Kafeel Ahmed, Glasgow airport bomber, former president of the Islamic society Queens University Belfast

 
 http://www.britannica.com/bps/additi...AN-THE-BOMBERS 

 nassari 

ETA -  better link for Nassari 

 
Yassin Nassari, who was sentenced for smuggling terrorist training manuals into the UK, is said to have been radicalised while at the University of Westminster, where he was president ofthe Islamic Society in 2003

 
 Khan  - AHA! I think he may have the wrong 7/7 bomber. Possibly not Khan, but Zaman. I have emailed Steyn and will print his reply, if any.

 
Waheed Zaman, 22, of Queens Road, Walthamstow

Mr Zaman is a biomedical science student and a well-known political activist. He is head of the Islam Society at London Metropolitan University and is reported to have spoken at Muslim rallies and written a number of articles about Islam for the student magazine.

 
So, based on the articles posted above, are the Times, Telegraph, Encyclopedia Brittanica, etc., all wrong, or did Mr. Steyn correctly deduce that Presidents of 4 different Islamic Societies at UK universities have turned out to be terrorists?
 
 
"A scientific (or  empirical  ) skeptic is one who questions the reliability of certain kinds of claims by subjecting them to a systematic investigation.  [6]  The  scientific method  details the specific process by which this investigation of  reality  is conducted. Considering the rigor of the scientific method, science itself may simply be thought of as an organized form of skepticism. This does not mean that the scientific skeptic is necessarily a scientist who conducts live experiments (though this may be the case), but that the skeptic generally accepts claims that are in his/her view likely to be true based on testable  hypotheses  and  critical thinking ."

9-11 Truthers...are VERY poor skeptics. If anything, they are pseudo-skeptics.

Perhaps you could post a link to 4 president of Christian or Jewish student groups that have committed mass murder? Since you seem to be making claims of equivalency.

PS - we eagerly await your evidence that Dick Cheney committed treason. You are 0 for 2.

I can do better than that. I can name four Presidents or Prime Ministers of whole countries who have committed mass murder that exceeds anything these alleged Muslim Terrorists could ever dream of both in terms of numbers killed and the sneaky lying ways they did the killing.

1)Lyndon Johnson: Escalated what was a small police action that about 300-400 men were killed into a mass murder spree that lasted for almost ten years and killed 58000 US servicemen and two to three million Vietnamese and Cambodians. He and his minions in the US Navy engineered a false flag attack in the Gulf of Tonkin to start the kill fest. I think he may have claimed to be a Christian at some point in his life.

2)George H. W. Bush: Was involved in mass killings from Baghdad to Panama City along with encouraging Saddam Husein into a bloody war with Iran has killed more people than small pox in his long and disgusting career. Anglican Christian.

3)Menachem Begin: A real terrorists terrorist! Started killing people in the early '40s when he was in his twenties and remained active and prolific into his eighties. A disgusting sneaky backstabber and huge racist supremicist. This guy was a five tool terrorist. Athiest Jewish Supremicist.

4)George W. Bush and his band of neo-CON liars. Holds the modern day record (since 1960s) for sheer number killed for absolutely no reason other than the fact that he wanted to break his fathers record. The blood is still flowing all around the gulf as a result of this little puke. Claimed to be a "born again" Christian.

Cheney was the "brains" and the mastermind behind the G W Bush killing spree. The Babe Ruth of War Criminals, since the days of Hitler and Stalin.

Re: the 9/11 "truth" movement, I think George Monbiot put it best:

The obvious corollorary to the belief that the Bush administration is all-powerful is that the rest of us are completely powerless. In fact it seems to me that the purpose of the “9/11 truth movement” is to be powerless. The omnipotence of the Bush regime is the coward’s fantasy, an excuse for inaction used by those who don’t have the stomach to engage in real political fights.

ETA - More George Monbiot, since Slayhamlet is quoting him too:

The 9/11 conspiracy theories are a displacement activity. A displacement activity is something you do because you feel incapable of doing what you ought to do. A squirrel sees a larger squirrel stealing its hoard of nuts. Instead of attacking its rival, it sinks its teeth into a tree and starts ripping it to pieces. Faced with the mountainous challenge of the real issues we must confront, the chickens in the “truth” movement focus instead on a fairytale, knowing that nothing they do or say will count, knowing that because the perpetrators don’t exist, they can’t fight back. They demonstrate their courage by repeatedly bayoneting a scarecrow.

Here's a bases loaded double to right center....

 http://www.informationclearinghouse....ticle22684.htm 

Excerpt:

"Since everything the people were told turned out to be lies, questions would inevitably arise regarding the catalyst itself, the new Pearl Harbor event so useful to PNAC and the Bush Administration.

This, I submit is what officials in the Obama Administration fear the most. An investigation of torture would inevitably lead to questions about what 9/11 was really about. We know with certainty that the official version of events is a pack of lies; what if America had to confront the fact that 9/11 really was an inside job? (The recent finding of nano-thermite in WTC dust is just one more compelling argument.) Its even possible that Cheney has threatened to spill the beans if anyone comes after him for torture for which he has openly and brazenly taken credit. Would a torturer refuse to stoop to blackmail? If that seems farfetched wouldnt torture itself have seemed so a relatively short time ago? Cheney et al have enhanced interrogated at least a hundred people to death. To paraphrase the Bard, Cheney crap by any other name would smell as foul. Torture is torture, even by their twisted Bybee/Yoo definitions.

Such a finding would so undermine Americans core beliefs as to have profoundly unpredictable consequences. It would mean that no American is safe from its own terrorist government. It would mean that government is not only corrupt to its very foundations, but also that it is a force of malevolence toward its citizens. It would mean that there is nothing in which to place ones political faith. It would mean that the same forces that killed 3000 Americans on that day (and many subsequently) still operate behind the scenes in Washington, and change is only cosmetic. It would prove that over the last two terms, democracy was a cruel illusion in America (and some would say since November 22, 1963). It would mean that for the patriotic American citizen, at last theres nothing left to lose.

Thats what theyre rightly afraid of.

Thats why they want to allow the Bush putsch to get away with murder.

And to look even further into the abyss."

But look into the abyss we must ~ for true transformation is never painless and must start with the truth and transparency ~ regardless of the consequences. We have a malignant cancer and it must be fully identified and isolated before it can be treated.

It's time for Congress to investigate the massive Iraq-Torture Scandal ~ and for the Department of Justice to prosecute Dick Cheney for creating it.

Funny how 9-11 Deniers believe that one of the main reasons for 9-11 and the invasion of Afghanistan was to build a natural gas pipeline from the Caspian Sea.

And yet, to this date, no such pipeline has been built.

That is because we diverted our rescources from Afghanistan and couldn't secure the pipeline route sufficiently to begin construction safely. Obama has sent another 30000 men for this reason. Now they hope to be able to secure the pipeline route while also holding down control of the heroin fields. These things take time champ...

Ralph Schoenman was ignored in '67. He was later proved to be directly on target then....50,000 dead American soldiers later, the war finally ended in Viet Nam....How long before this debaucle is ended, and the perps locked up? It is up to us...Thanks

What you inaccurately portyay regarding Shoenman and others as ones who: " have no desire to do anything, ever, other than complain about things to each other", is an obvious falacy as proven by the excellent documentary I have presented for your perusal.

 http://video.google.com/videoplay?do...2929899&hl=en# 

The research and expense of creating this and other journalistic ventures into world politics is anything but "doing nothing". And to assert that they are in it for the money is laughable at best. When people like Nimmo and Shoenman are given fair access to the mass media, then we will get the necessesary changes to overcome the insanity, death, wars, disease and brutality that prevails as the accepted norm for our "civilization".

I notice that you haven't adressed ANY of the claims made in this excellent and succunct 18 minute film, but instead attack the messenger ad hominem.

Thanks

And that is the exact reason that we have had an almost seamless continuation of same insanity after Viet Nam...Central America, Chile, and now the oil and heroin wars in the middle east. It will go on and on until we DO get these animals locked up. That is the whole point. When we realize the obvious fact that those who profit from this vile murderous behavior are the very ones who stage and choreograph these attrocities from behind the scenes, then we'll take appropriate action against them. That is what the "TRUTH" movement is all about.

The owners of the banks who make their fortunes loaning money at usury rates to both sides of these conflicts, the armament manufacturers who sell to both sides at a hefty profit while the blood of young men and innocent women and children flows, and the whores in government who are paid off to give them licence to operate through crooked legislation are the culprits. Find out who controls these entities and you have your perpetrators. This is not rocket science and it has been going on for centuries.

Spoken like a couple guys who are aware of the truth of the matters being discussed here, but are smug and confident that their heros will continue to get away with the profitable murder and mayhem that they deal in. People who seek truth and justice for all men will never give up, and rarely "break down in tears". We just keep fighting the good fight champ.

those ripples build a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.

Life isn't as you represent it. There is no black and white, no cabal of evil people who hold the rest in thrall. It might be nice if there was a single source of evil that we could track back to it's lair and slay it with a single stroke of the sword but the fact is that we are all sources of both evil and good. The hero who slays the dragon today becomes the tyrant of tomorrow, the oppressed seize power and immediately use to oppress others, those who are blessed quickly turn to curse others and so it goes and so it has been.

Your reform would soon become repression all done in the name of good.

It's so cute that you think people would support the hellishly oppressive, dystopian nightmare you guys would impose if you were in charge. You can say what you want about our (fictional) NWO overlords, but at least they let us live in a free society where I can think and do what I want. In your society, Sweetcakes, it seems that even having this conversation would get us locked up and ordered for reprograming.

I'll keep what we've got, Tiger.
 
 
 
Life isn't as you represent it. There is no black and white, no cabal of evil people who hold the rest in thrall. It might be nice if there was a single source of evil that we could track back to it's lair and slay it with a single stroke of the sword but the fact is that we are all sources of both evil and good. The hero who slays the dragon today becomes the tyrant of tomorrow, the oppressed seize power and immediately use to oppress others, those who are blessed quickly turn to curse others and so it goes and so it has been.

Your reform would soon become repression all done in the name of good.

(yes Darat that's just a long version of your sig)

 
There is some black and white, not all is such, but there definitly IS an evil cabal who now holds "much of the world in it's thrall". To say otherwise is to ignore the history of the last two hundred years and beyond. It is however true that in recent history many of the popular uprisings have resulted in a different set of tyrants being installed and controlled by the same entity. I would agree that it is not some dragon who can be stopped by simply "tracking it back to its lair" and slaying it. The entity I am referring to is international in scope and multifaceted. At any rate, the first step in ending its tyranny is to identify it and expose it for what it is. That is my intention here. Thanks

Excerpt:

"From all available evidence * it's clear that the most compelling hypothesis explaining the interconnected crimes, lies, and human slaughter occurring in our modern world is that an international cabal took control of the United States in the early part of the twentieth century and is now methodically destroying American and world institutions and values. The main goal of the cabal has been to consolidate political, economic, and social power in its hands while obliterating the minds of the masses to establish a militaristic, imperialistic dictatorship.
By designating this cabal as "demonic," I do not imply that there is need for hatred, anxiety, or hopelessness. It is simply the situation that this cabal has seized control and we need to face it and get on with the business of overcoming this global cartel and bringing about fundamental change in our society. We should not simply sit about idly theorizing or smiling at the devastation of human beings in our society and throughout the world. Something must be done!"

A good read. Informative and interesting.

And the head of this evil cabal lives in an extinct volcano in Japan, has a scar down his face, and has a white Persian cat as a pet, right?
 
 
 
What you inaccurately portyay regarding Shoenman and others as ones who: " have no desire to do anything, ever, other than complain about things to each other", is an obvious falacy as proven by the excellent documentary I have presented for your perusal.

 http://video.google.com/videoplay?do...2929899&hl=en# 

 
God bless those journalists for exposing the truth, sure. And the real-world consequences of the words they write are ____________? That Dick Cheney indictment should be a slam-dunk with these heroes at the helm. It's coming when, again? As beachnut often notes, a proof of 'inside job' for 9/11 would earn a Pulitzer prize. None is forthcoming. Just silly opinion pieces on 'looking into the abyss' and such. Impotent is almost too kind a word.

 
The research and expense of creating this and other journalistic ventures into world politics is anything but "doing nothing". And to assert that they are in it for the money is laughable at best. When people like Nimmo and Shoenman are given fair access to the mass media, then we will get the necessesary changes to overcome the insanity, death, wars, disease and brutality that prevails as the accepted norm for our "civilization".

 
Why do they need to be "given" anything? What kind of lousy movement do you have there, waiting for media handouts? Why is your movement incapable of accomplishing anything, vs. real not-for-profit associations that effect real change in the world? Do you think that Greenpeace, the WWF, Amnesty International or heck, PETA are "given" access to the media? No, they earn it by providing compelling information that makes people actually want to do something.

 
I notice that you haven't adressed ANY of the claims made in this excellent and succunct 18 minute film, but instead attack the messenger ad hominem.

Thanks

 
There was no ad-hominem. I said I'd rather watch paint dry. And it's true. I am, right this second, watching paint dry. Second coat on the ceiling. I got 2 gallons of the good Behr stuff on sale for $25 in a big tub. And you don't want me to watch cable news, but I should watch google videos instead? This seems odd. You can't succinctly make your point here; I have to watch a video?

PS - the word you are looking for is astute.  
 
 
SO now jmh423 has gone from blaming all the evils in the world on Hasidic Jews to some Sooper Sekrit Organization right out of a James Bond movie. Don't know if that is a step forward (at least it is not as bigoted) or backward (but it is a lot crazier).

Is this what you are referring to as the "Blofeld Brigade"?

Carroll Quigley, Georgetown University history professor (deceased), in Tragedy and Hope: A History of the World in Our Time, 1966, made this claim:

"There does exist and has existed for a generation, an international Anglophile network which operates, to some extent, in the way the radical Right believes the Communists act. In fact, this network, which we may identify as the Round Table groups, has no aversion to cooperating with the Communists, or any other groups, and frequently does so. I know of the operations of this network because I have studied it for 20 years and was permitted for two years, in the early 1960s, to examine its papers and secret record.
"In addition to these pragmatic goals, the powers of financial capitalism had another far-reaching aim, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements arrived at in frequent private meetings and conferences. The apex of the system was the Bank for International Settlements in Basle, Switzerland, a private bank owned and controlled by the world's central banks which were themselves private corporations. The growth of financial capitalism made possible a centralization of world economic control and use of this power for the direct benefit of financiers and the indirect injury of all other economic groups.''

1)Do you think that Professor Quigley was a crackpot or a liar?

2)If this claim by Quigley is indeed true, do you percive any danger to the US Constiitution and the personal freedom of the average citizen?

3)If this group exists, and is enacting the agenda that Professor Quigley says it is, do you support this group and its goals?
 
 
 
While tales of Muslim terrorists so vile that we must now subject our wives and daughters to a vaginal inspection by a ten dollar an hour TSA hack before getting on an airliner polute the airwaves, and half of the morons in the country actually welcome this idiocy....The debunking crew here at JREF refuse to discuss the real terrorists who have been steadily destroying the US Constitution, the Bill of Rights and the right of all citizens of the world to Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. I know who the REAL terrorists are...do you?

 
Your lofty ideals are admirable. Your slippery grasp of reality, less so.
 
 
I really wasn't calling anyone a name, just trying to bring a little levity to things. Unlike Norman Livergood, who owns the domain "hermes-press.com" and posts at rense.com, I am not a hater.

And 'vaginal inspection' is not even the most ridiculous strawman raised here. Which is sad.
 
 
 
3)If this group exists, and is enacting the agenda that Professor Quigley says it is, do you support this group and its goals?

 
If Santa Claus exists, and engages in the activities described in popular culture, do you support his practice of breaking into peoples' homes to leave gifts made by elves?

Yes, I think Quigley is a crackpot.
Sad to say, you can find lots of Woo among College and University professors.

Thanks for providing a clear and responsive answer. That as you can see, is becoming a rarity here. That said, do you also think that Woodrow Wilson and Professor Arthur S. Miller were cranks dealing in "Woo"???? By the way, what is woo?

"In his 1913 book The New Freedom, President Woodrow Wilson stated:
"Since I entered politics, I have chiefly had men's views confided to me privately. Some of the biggest men in the United States, in the field of commerce and manufacture, are afraid of something. They know that there is a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive, that they had better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it."

After years of studying the present cabal, Arthur S. Miller, George Washington University law professor asserted:

"Those who formally rule take their signals and commands not from the electorate as a body, but from a small group of men (plus a few women).... It exists even though that existence is stoutly denied. It is one of the secrets of the American social order.... A second secret is the fact that the existence of the Establishment -- the ruling class -- is not supposed to be discussed.''
 
 
 
1)Do you think that Professor Quigley was a crackpot or a liar?

 
Yes.

 
2)If this claim by Quigley is indeed true, do you percive any danger to the US Constiitution and the personal freedom of the average citizen?

 
In the 43 years since he wrote it, personal freedom has decreased how much for the "average citizen?" I suspect that African-Americans in the South would have a different opinion than gun owners in urban areas, but really there hasn't been much of a paradigm shift.

 
3)If this group exists, and is enacting the agenda that Professor Quigley says it is, do you support this group and its goals?

 
It doesn't, and I don't.

Lots of well-educated people believe wacky stuff. Did you notice that most Universities have theology departments, and often Christian / Buddhist / Islam / Jewish centers? They can't all be right, can they?
 
 
 
"In his 1913 book The New Freedom, President Woodrow Wilson stated:

They know that there is a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive, that they had better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it."

 
And here is the complete quote for context, where Wilson is clearly relating corporate and business monopoly power.

 
Since I entered politics, I have chiefly had men's views confided to me privately. Some of the biggest men in the United States, in the field of commerce and manufacture, are afraid of somebody, are afraid of something. They know that there is a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive, that they had better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it.
They know that America is not a place of which it can be said, as it used to be, that a man may choose his own calling and pursue it just as far as his abilities enable him to pursue it; because to-day, if he enters certain fields, there are organizations which will use means against him that will prevent his building up a business which they do not want to have built up; organizations that will see to it that the ground is cut from under him and the markets shut against him. For if he begins to sell to certain retail dealers, to any retail dealers, the monopoly will refuse to sell to those dealers, and those dealers, afraid, will not buy the new man's wares.

 
This powerful cabal was so powerful that Wilson was able to create the Federal Trade Commission and pass the Clayton Anti-Trust Act. The FTC was not shy about exercising the power, and issued literally dozens of cease-and-desist orders in Wilson's time.

(ETA link to  Wilson & Anti-Trust Legislation  )

And again, what you claim your quote proves is nothing of the sort. Do you ever tire of this?
 
 
 
Is this a sarcastic way of conveying that you feel that Quigley was lying or delusional? Quigley was one of Bill Clinton's mentors, and was generally considered to be a credible, learned and intelligent man.

 
I have no way of evaluating whether he was lying or delusional, because I can't interact with him as I can with you.

I believe that YOU are delusional.

Oh, and your appeal to authority is noted, as always.

OK so Quigley was a crackpot, and Wilson was taken out of context.... I think that you are quite presumptuous to consider yourself more versed about the subjects that Quigley so eloquently wrote of in '66. In fact I have never read or even heard of anyone of note who directly challenged the Professors assertions outside of unqualified chat room "debunkers", much less called him a liar or a crackpot like you and dudalb have this morning. That is interesting.

In reading Wilson's book, as I did years ago, I was left with the impression that Wilson was talking about what was known as "The Money Trust". Wilson in the quote I mined, clearly states that "Some of the biggest men in the United States, in the field of commerce and manufacture, are afraid of something". This was about the time that Henry Ford publicly attacked the international banking cartel.

You and the rest of the so called "skeptics" have a habit of demonizing and marginalizing anyone who attacks the corrupt financial sysytem that is, and has been for at least a century, totally undermining the US government and our Constitution by the means of bribery and blackmail. I wonder why?
 
 
 
That said, do you also think that Woodrow Wilson and Professor Arthur S. Miller were cranks dealing in "Woo"???? By the way, what is woo?

 
Evidence here is judged by its own merit, not by the supposed character of historical figures you choose to quote.

 
"In his 1913 book The New Freedom, President Woodrow Wilson stated:

They know that there is a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive, that they had better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it."

 
The fact that this "power" he spoke of can, and has been, interpreted to mean any number of things (satanists, aliens, repto-sapiens, etc.) shows that this statement should not be taken out of context.

What is the context, exactly? Have you read the book?
 
 
 
OK so Quigley was a crackpot, and Wilson was taken out of context.... I think that you are quite presumptuous to consider yourself more versed about the subjects that Quigley so eloquently wrote of in '66.

 
I demonized and marginalized no one. If this Quigley guy believes in a super-secret "Round Table" organization, then he's delusional.

 
In fact I have never read or even heard of anyone of note who directly challenged the Professors assertions outside of unqualified chat room "debunkers", much less called him a liar or a crackpot like you and dudalb have this morning. That is interesting.

 
And I have never met anyone who voted for Richard Nixon. Or anyone who was abducted by aliens for that matter. Interesting.

I am quite sure that you got that impression regarding Wilson's book. Because you see conspiracies everywhere. When Catholics see the virgin Mary in the wall after the roof leaks, it is because they are pre-disposed to see something there. Make sense?

When I correctly point out that Wilson enacted legislation and created a new agency, the FTC, to combat monopolies, how can you still find this all-powerful cabal in there? What, the "international banking cartel" couldn't stop the President and Congress? Too weak? Nonexistent, maybe?

ETA - re: This was about the time that Henry Ford publicly attacked the international banking cartel.... the fact that Henry Ford was a flaming anti-semite who saw a grand Jewish conspiracy to control the world is no doubt related to what you are saying, yes?

You still don't understand that you're appealing to authority, rather than making a coherent argument backed by evidence?

It doesn't matter what a person's credentials is. It isn't a good idea to accept whatever he says, or reject whatever he says, based on whether or not he is a person of "note".

 
You and the rest of the so called "skeptics" have a habit of demonizing and marginalizing anyone who attacks the corrupt financial sysytem that is, and has been for at least a century, totally undermining the US government and our Constitution by the means of bribery and blackmail. I wonder why?

 
You are wrong. Skeptics attack anyone who makes outrageous statements without presenting a shred of evidence. It doesn't really matter what the topic is.
 
 
 
Yes.

In a 1912 campaign speech Wilson said:

"We have restricted credit, we have restricted opportunity, we have controlled development, and we have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated, governments in the civilized world--no longer a government by free opinion, no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men."

Later Wilson was duped into signing the Federal Reserve act which was concocted and disguised as an opposition bill to a similar Republican sponsored bill both of which amounted to the same result, which was the stealth and permanant takeover of the US monetary system by a coeterie of international bankers who have used it to greatly enrich themselves at the expense of the American people. The record is abundantly clear regarding this. Look at what is going on right now. This Islamo-terror crap is just a staged distraction similar to a band of thieves staging a fight in a store, keeping security personell busy, while their coconspirators walk out with the loot.

It was a campaign speech not a reasoned analysis.

First you quote Wilson as an authority then you say he was duped so which is it dupe or expert.

Ah, now you are getting to the crux of the truther paradox.  

With this in mind, I eagerly wait for any evidence of anything at all to be posted here.
 
 
 
I understand exactly what I'm trying to convey here, what I am appealing to, and its implications. I disagree with your condecending assertion that I am not making a "coherent argument".

 
You're not making any type of argument, coherent or otherwise. You are simply copy-and-pasting the words of famous people and expecting us to draw the same conclusions you have from them.

 
It DOES "really matter what a person's credentials is", for the purpose of this forum, whether you like it or not.

Self proclaimed, yet utterly unqualified (by any and all accepted measures) "skeptics" here on this thread, are continually either denying the viability of noted experts who ARE qualified (by any reasonable measures and standards) and disparaging them as crackpots, liars, anti-semites and worse.

 
Their viability is irrelevant. Whether or not they are crackpots, liars, or anti-semites is irrelevant. All that matters is whether or not their arguments make sense. Otherwise, it's just an appeal to authority.

The bottom line is this: We will not accept what you say as the gospel truth simply because you have quoted a few famous people. State your case and back it up with evidence, not flowery words.
 
 
 
The final solution of parky and Carlitos, after being humiliated repeatedly for days on end here, (for which there is documented evidence) is to go into a Peewee Hermanesque duet of ignoring the facts and calling me a pussy in unison. I know you are but what am I? You guys are precious. You should go get a room. Thanks again boys.

"The cabal has stolen money from Social Security to finance its militaristic wars in Afghanistan and Iraq (hence the cabal's frantic effort to destroy the Social Security system). It has skewed the tax laws so that the rich pay almost nothing while the working class suffers under huge tax burdens. The cabal is so insane that it has led America--and the world--into a financial catastrophe that makes the 1930s depression look like child's play."

"Thank you for that wonderful tribute to Henry Kissinger yesterday. Congratulations. As the most recent National Security Advisor of the United States, I take my daily orders from Dr. Kissinger, filtered down through Generaal [sic] Brent Scowcroft and Sandy Berger, who is also here. We have a chain of command in the National Security Council that exists today."

Remarks of U.S. National Security Adviser James L. Jones at the 45th Munich Conference on Security Policy at the Hotel Bayerischer Hof, 2/8/09

Does this smack of unelected entities excercising control illegally over US citizens? It sure looks that way to me.

 

OOPPPSSS Facts dont seem to back you up there sport!

IRS data shows that in 2004, the richest 50% of the taxpayers paid 96.7% of all income taxes. From 1986 to 2004, the share paid by the richest half increased from 93.5% to 96.7%, and the share paid by the richest 1% increased from 25.75% to 36.89%. At the same time, the amount paid by the poorer half decreased from 6.5% in 1986 to 3.3% in 2004. While the poor's contribution was cut in half, the richest Americans saw their contribution increase by nearly 50%. When you get past the propaganda, for the last two decades the rich have been paying more and more while the poor have been paying less and less.

To put it simply, of the $832 billion in personal income taxes collected in 2004, the richest half of the country paid $804 billion while the poorest half only paid $27.4 billion.
 http://www.craigsteiner.us/articles/9 

Our tax system, however, is highly progressive, meaning that as one's income rises, a higher proportion of that income is taxed. Thus, those in the highest tax brackets contribute more to the overall tax burden even though there are far more people in lower tax brackets.1

* According to data from the IRS, the bottom 50 percent of income earners pay approximately 4 percent of income taxes.
* The top 25 percent of income earners pay nearly 83 percent of the income tax burden, and the top 10 percent pay 65 percent.
* The top 1 percent of income earners pay almost 35 percent of all income taxes.
* The top 400 richest Americans paid 1.58 of total income taxes in 2000.

Rising Federal Taxes for the Rich

The empirical evidence shows that the wealthiest citizens are also paying an ever-increasing proportion of all taxes collected by the federal government. Data from the Congressional Budget Office show not only that taxes on the wealthy have risen over time but that the 2001 Bush tax cut barely kept their share of the tax burden from rising further:2
 http://taxesandgrowth.ncpa.org/news/...eir-fair-share 

2. What income group pays the most federal income taxes today?

The latest data show that a big portion of the federal income tax burden is shoul*dered by a small group of the very richest Americans. The wealthiest 1 percent of the population earn 19 per*cent of the income but pay 37 percent of the income tax. The top 10 percent pay 68 percent of the tab. Meanwhile, the bottom 50 percent—those below the median income level—now earn 13 percent of the income but pay just 3 percent of the taxes. These are proportions of the income tax alone and don’t include payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare.

These are what sane people call facts!Not he said she said but facts!
You sir have been duped! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  
 
 
 
I love this. A report puked out by a GOP thinktank stating that the rich are getting hosed. Priceless!!

I'm sure that I can dig up a completely different set of figures by consulting a Democrat sponsored hype site. Along with different IRS numbers showing how the poor are getting hosed by the rich....bla bla bla bla.....Skewed numbers and so called "facts" cooked up by political spinmeisters bore me champ. I certainly don't want to get into a Demikin vs Republicrat turdfest here... and once again....You are out of your element...

Actually dipstick I did something you have never done!
That is present facts from 3 different sources!
I will not watch your stupid you tube crap!
Facts are facts wither you agree with them or not!
Not my fault!

Lets look at some more facts from a independt source sshall we.....

As nearly everyone knows, some taxes fall heavily on upper-income Americans while others fall heavily on low-income Americans. For example, the federal income tax is heavily skewed toward those with the highest incomes, because it has six tax rates that rise from 10 percent to 35 percent as income rises. In contrast, cigarette taxes fall mostly on the lowest-earning Americans, because those with low incomes are more likely to smoke than those with high incomes.
However, when all taxes are considered together, Americas highest-earning income groups clearly pay the largest amounts of taxes to finance government spending programs.

When all government spending is included, households in the lowest quintile received about $8.21 in spending for every dollar of taxes paid. Households in the middle quintile received $1.30, and households in the top quintile received $0.41.

In 2002 the latest year of available data, the top 5 percent of taxpayers paid more than one-half (53.8 percent) of all individual income taxes, but reported roughly one-third (30.6 percent) of income.
The top 1 percent of taxpayers paid 33.7 percent of all individual income taxes in 2002. This group of taxpayers has paid more than 30 percent of individual income taxes since 1995. Moreover, since 1990 this groups tax share has grown faster than their income share.
Taxpayers who rank in the top 50 percent of taxpayers by income pay virtually all individual income taxes. In all years since 1990, taxpayers in this group have paid over 94 percent of all individual income taxes. In 2000, 2001, and 2002, this group paid over 96 percent of the total.

Treasury Department analysts credit President Bush's tax cuts with shifting a larger share of the individual income taxes paid to higher income taxpayers. In 2005, says the Treasury, when most of the tax cut provisions are fully in effect (e.g., lower tax rates, the $1,000 child credit, marriage penalty relief), the projected tax share for lower-income taxpayers will fall, while the tax share for higher-income taxpayers will rise.

# The share of taxes paid by the bottom 50 percent of taxpayers will fall from 4.1 percent to 3.6 percent.

# The share of taxes paid by the top 1 percent of taxpayers will rise from 32.3 percent to 33.7 percent.

# The average tax rate for the bottom 50 percent of taxpayers falls by 27 percent as compared to a 13 percent decline for taxpayers in the top 1 percent.

The White House has announced it will lobby Congress to pass legislation making most of President Bush's tax cutting measures permanent.

The highest earners pay the lion's share of the dollars Uncle Sam collects.

The top fifth of households made 56% of pre-tax income in 2006 but paid 86% of all individual income tax revenue collected, according to the most recent data available from the Congressional Budget Office.

Narrowing in further: The top 1% of households, which made 19% of pre-tax income, paid 39% of all individual income taxes.

Sorry dude your lies dont hold water!
Every source you look at says the same thing.Heck most of them say 42% of Americans dont pay any tax at

You may try and dispute the facts all you want but you will only be lieing to us and yourself!
 
 
 
Who the hell are you to decide unilaterally whether Wilson's assertions in that campaign speech were or were not, a "reasoned analysis"????

He was an authority who was later duped into signing the Federal Reserve Bill, which in many learned peoples opinions, turned out to be the worst monetary policy decision in the history of the US. I know it is unfortunate, but credible well meaning experts are sometimes duped by clever ruses. It wasn't the first time this has happened, and certainly not the last. Thanks

 
I'm not sure what my residence has to do with it but "reasoned analysis" and "campaign speech" are not equivalent.

Maybe he was duped when he made the speech and not when he signed the bill or maybe he was duped both times.

BTW do politicians routinely expose vast evil cabals in their stump speeches?
 
 
I wonder if any members of the secret round table cabal who have been taking over the world for at least the last 100 years are Muslim?

Some of those Saudi oil Sheiks are pretty rich and influential, how would they get along with the Jews in their little cabal?

Do the CEOs of Coke and Pepsi get together and collude over how much market share each shall get?

Same for all the different Oil companies, Arms manufacturers, Mining companies etc?

Just how can you imagine that a handful of Plutocrats not only are capable of agreeing on a specific agenda, but are also capable of ordering everyone else in the world to do their bidding?

These people don't believe in or care about main stream religion. These concocted religions and their leaders are used by the elite to manipulate the ignorant masses into useless conflicts that generate war profits. This whole religious war crap is a hoax fomented by the power brokers. The head Jews, Christians, Muslims, and Hindus who are at the high levels of the banking aristocracy don't buy any of that "religious" crap. The "religion" of the elites is Egyptian Mystery School and Kaballah type black magic....pedofilia seems to be a part of it..

"Just how can you imagine that a handful of Plutocrats not only are capable of agreeing on a specific agenda, but are also capable of ordering everyone else in the world to do their bidding?

Good question. If I were them I would arrange meetings every year or so of the top banking aristocrats, the Royal Families, top arms dealers and oil barons and invite a select group of useful tools that are hired or elected by different countries to attend. (Governors, Senators, Prime Ministers, future Presidential candidates and such.) I would also invite high ranking, key members of the largest world media outlets to attend and make sure that nothing inside these meetings was printed or reported in any main stream publications or other sources. Can you think of any such arrangement?

Thanks for your interest.

"Major players in the demonic cabal include the Saudi royal family and The Big Three--the bin Laden family, the al Ahmoudi family, and the Mahfouz family--the richest clans in that medieval kingdom. The Saudi brand of Islam is Wahabism, which enjoins its adherents to destroy all infidels in a holy war. Most of the "Iraqi insurgents" now killing Iraqis and American service personnel are trained in Saudi Arabia."
 
 
 
Could this be relavent?

"For the vast majority of Masons, Freemasonry is a lifelong succession of deceptions. Most Lodge leaders do not realize that they are deceiving their members. For the most part, they are simply reciting the same things they have heard and said, over and over, assuming that they are right and good. However, the Princes and Adepts of Freemasonry deliberately deceive the Masons under them."

"The Blue Degrees are but the outer court or portico of the Temple. Part of the symbols are displayed there to the initiate, but he is intentionally misled by false interpretations. It is not intended that he shall understand them, but it is intended that he shall imagine he understands them. Their true explanation is reserved for the Adepts, the Princes of Masonry."

Yes, the one that says that all Conspiracy Theories were started by con men to steal money and fame from the delusional.

Which is, in fact, the most realistic CT...

They don't buy any of "that religious crap", and yet they believe in the Egyptian Mystery School and Kaballah type black magic... You don't see a contradiction here?

Pedophilia? Really? These elite power mongers who control the world and profit from all kinds of atrocities are also a pack of rock-spiders? Obviously their evil knows no bounds, in much the same way that your argument knows no evidence.

Is it bigger than a breadbox?

I particularly like the way you presume to know what goes on at these "top secret" meetings even though you are not a top Banking Aristocrat, Arms Dealer, Presidential Candidate etc. Do they sit around agreeing to stuff like killing 80% of the world's population with flouride and lobotomising the rest with reality TV?

And our main weapon will be SURPRISE!
 
 
 
You're not making any type of argument, coherent or otherwise. You are simply copy-and-pasting the words of famous people and expecting us to draw the same conclusions you have from them.

 
This is correct.

jmh423, I guess what we are all missing is the following:
Who is in the cabal? What is their goal? Where do they meet? How often? What's the name of the club? Do they wear funny hats? Do they pay dues?
And, as always, some evidence ** that supports your claim. Or at least a cogent attempt at dot-connecting. Even that crazy chart I posted is easier to follow than your vague intimations, and argument-by-quote technique.

**To clarify, these things are not evidence that a demonic transnational cabal of pedophiliac bankers / Saudi royals / freemasons are responsible for evil deeds and secretly manipulating the world to achieve their aims: Anonymous ex-CIA official tells Newsweek magazine that Mossad could recruit Jews in US to help them. Israeli criminals steal security secrets and commit cyber-crime. Woodrow Wilson's book where he talks about monopoly power. Fake quotes about satanic spheres of non-Jews' souls. Wayne Madsen opinion pieces. Anything on youtube!!! Summarize the 'proof' in your words and source it!
I mean, at the end of it all, you seem to be saying that "the powerful people are running things." Which is really not insightful or sinister. You haven't even attempted to offer evidence of collusion in some sort of 'cabal' or whatever. Your arguments here are no different than the fellow trying to convince JREF in the reality of UFO aliens, or the poor fellows trying to prove that the "New Testament writers told the truth." You haven't posted a shred of evidence here.
 
 
 
Gee champ. You would make a good Fox News GOP economic pundit....One thing that NONE of your figures seem to take into consideration (I wonder why) are what is known as: PAYROLL TAXES. And since the post you are responding to relates to super rich thieves raiding the SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM, all your points are MOOT..When the nunmbers are redone with the PAYROLL TAXES the percentages of ALL taxes paid by the extremely wealthy compared to the lower brackets the numbers change dramatically. Get to work and redo the numbers taking into consideration ALL TAXES paid. You are just spewing a bunch of deceptive figures aroud in the mode of Sean Hannity, Hugh Hewitt, and any number of other lying, pseudo-conservative morons. You are not breaking any new ground here sport. You should try to find the typical Democrat vs Republican thread to ply your transparent, and sneaky trade. I'm sure there is one right here on JREF. With the sneaky set of deceptive numbers that you no doubt have loaded up in your favorites list, you could be a real star there as a GOP rallier!!!

Here however, I am already dealing with 3-5 pseudo-intelectual obfuscaters along with a couple of mentally challenged ADL-type bomb-throwers. (parky/dudalb) I don't have time right now for your nonsense. Go find some phony liberal and give him hell. I wish you and the old GOP all the best!!Thanks

 

That is 57,000 wealthy American tax cheats at one swiss bank
How many banks in switzerland cater to wealthy " Americans "
avoiding taxes ?
How many countries act as Tax havens for wealty " Americans"
avoiding taxes ?

One DoJ lawyer and whistle-blower are given credit for exposing this massive tax evasion conspiracy.
Can the U.S. citizens view the names of these criminals that illegally
hid incomes and assets in off shore tax havens?
Certainly NOT ! That would be against IRS/DoJ privacy policy.
We'll just have to wait until the newspapers decide to tell the
law abiding Americans who these wealthy tax cheats are eh ?

UBS, U.S. and Swiss reach deal on releasing names of possible tax evaders
UBS AG and the U.S. and Swiss governments have worked out agreement
to settle a dispute over whether the Swiss bank should be forced to disclose
the names of 52,000 wealthy American clients suspected of tax evasion, media
outlets reported today.
 
 
 
1)Qualified "main stream" as opposed to Kaballah & Mystery School....No contradiction....Try to read all the words, smarty pants.

 
So they only believe in non-mainstream religious crap. OK. I still don't see how that means they all get along and share the same goals.

 
2)Rock spiders??? I'm not aware of this term. I believe there is evidence that many of these types like little boys, yes.

 
Rock-spider is a slang term for a pedophile. I note that this evidence that you believe exists, failed to materialise in your post...

 
3) Breadbox?? A lame attempt at humor? I don't know about this breadbox or its size...

 
Lame indeed. A reference to your little guessing game. If you mean the Bilderberg Group, why not just say that, instead of expecting people to guess what you mean?

 
4) Did I ever say that I know what goes on at these meetings, or anthing at all about killing 80% of the population? I just gave a hypothetical of how I would come to arrangements with other powerbrokers to conspire if I had a mind to. Are you just pulling this out your arse? Again, a good practice is to actually READ the post you are respondiing to.

 
You seem to think that these meetings do happen and that a secret evil demonic pedophiliac banker cabal uses them to plan world domination and I am curious as to how you know these things if the meetings are so top secret...

 
5)Demonic cabal was someone elses characterization, not mine. You should have said: How midevil of HIM.....

 
You don't agree with his characterisation? Why post it then?

 
Adios for now...DEBUNKERS SWARM!!!!

 
OK everyone it's safe to come out now, the big scary man has gone...
 
 
 
Demonic cabal was someone elses characterization, not mine

 
So, when someone asks you for evidence of this mysterious organization of which no evidence exists, and you post a paragraph on the subject, you don't agree with the paragraph you posted to support your argument? Really, that's what you are doing here?
 
 
 
I believe there is evidence

 
Ah, there's your problem!

Come back when you KNOW there is evidence.
 
 
 
Ah, there's your problem!

Come back when you KNOW there is evidence.

 
Or when he actually has it and is willing to post it. With this much of a tease he should at least show some skin.
 
 
  Given that this thread no longer makes any pretence at staying on topic, or even staying on any of the off-topic topics for more than a couple of posts, and has mostly degenerated into pointless bickering and personal attacks, it is being closed. On the off chance that there may be something worth reading somewhere in it, I won't dump the whole thread to AAH, but if people, especially Parky76 and and jmh423, carry on with this kind of behaviour they are likely to face stronger action.
