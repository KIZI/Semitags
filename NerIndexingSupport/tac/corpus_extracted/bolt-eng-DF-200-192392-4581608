Recently in inception and (500) Days Of Summer. I think he's a sexy, sexy, little Jew. Yay or nay?

 

 

 
 
 
Nicer in the later days of Third Rock From the Sun.
 
 
He is so hot. Also in inception...him in those suits....yum

He didn't have the suit then though... I think watching too much How I Met Your Mother has given me a thing for suits.

Scrap the suit, bring back the floppy hair and oversized shirts.

I have a compromise - scrap all the clothes. Full stop.

IKR? I have a poster of him from Inception that I SO didn't use my school printers to print  
 
 
yes, he would get it any time  , he looked his best with the joy division t-shirt and the floppy hair in 500 days of summer <3.
 
 
Fancied him when he was in Brick

That could work...

yeah I like him! Huge fan of 3rd rock and I think his hitrecord project is really cool
 
 
He is so hot in those suits in Inception. Although he's got some competition when he stands next to Tom Hardy...  

Plus he speaks French, which doesn't hurt.  
 
 
So, so, so hot. I've thought this ever since (500) Days of Summer.

He spea-? Oh dear God, i'm not getting that image out of my head in a long time. Though i did read a fanfiction in which Arthur knew French.

Yum Tom Hardy   And yum all the fanfics with the two of them "together".

Oh dear. -MEGASWOON-  
 
 
Oh yeah he's HAWT    
 
 
He's not ugly, but I don't find him particularly hot either. So meh from me.
 
 
He is amazinnggg  
 
 
JGL singing. In French.

Yes.
 
 
I wouldn't kick him out of bed..

I'd tie him to it.  
 
 
Loved him since 10 things I hate about you  
 
 
I always thought he looked best in Brick

I really shouldn't have made this thread, with you guys putting images like THIS   into my head, my obsession's not going to get any better.
 
 
i like him.   i've only seen him in inception, but i think he's very adorable.
plus he looks a little bit like heath ledger.

Yeah, he'd definitely get it.

lol we seem to share the same opinion on virtually everything on TSR.

Yeah, it's a bit creepy actually. Perhaps it's some sort of TSR parallel universe thing...

Re: JGL speaking French, I just found this

I don't even know what he's offering but I want some of it...

Haha... Nice! I want him to talk French to me. Or at me. Whatever it counts as when you don't really understand what someone's saying. He could literally not even be speaking French and I wouldn't care.

Ok. I'll stop. I'm sounding too full on and stalkery now. Plus he's not even my #1 celebrity crush

Inception fanfiction?? Where the f*** have I been?
Why didn't that occur to me?  

*goes off to find some*
 
 
Anyone remember him in 10 Things I hate about you? :P

Who is your number 1? Gotta ask, cos you obviously have good taste?

It's amazing, most of it's just Eames doing Arthur. Often involving suits.
 
 
yeah, he is like soooo hot you guys.....

Well, it's Jason Schwartzman. Not everybody's cup of tea I know, but he's the epitome of 'my type' and is creative and talented and lovely to boot.

I have a bit of a mini obsession  
 
 
 
Anyone remember him in 10 Things I hate about you? :P

 

Yeah LOL he was adorable!
 
 
I love him so much. My friend and I, being complete losers, sometimes have 'Joseph Nights' where we both watch one of his films but in our separate houses and quote it on msn in real time  

Oh hai neg-rep, how nice to see you  
 
 
He is perfection.
 
 
I wouldn't say no.

Whoa, you're right.
And to think, that pairing never occurred to me. It's hot though

It never occurred to me either. I had no idea all this fanfic was out there until the topic popped up in this thread... I have to admit I find it all a tad strange.

One of the few SFW fan art pictures of the pair:

 

Imagine how it must feel to be one of the actors... Confusing, I imagine  
 
 
A definite yay. He's just so cute.
 
 
He's really cute! And he was recently unofficially announced to play a role in the new Batman film =O Looking forward to seeing him there!
 
 
 

His face is beyond amazing
 
 
 
Yes.
