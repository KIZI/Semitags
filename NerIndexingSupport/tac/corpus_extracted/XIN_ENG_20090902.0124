South Korea's Daewoo International Company will invest 1.7 billion U.S. dollars
in expanding gas exploration and production at two blocks in western Myanmar's
Rakhine offshore area from where the gas produced will be exported to
neighboring China in 2013, a local weekly quoted an announcement of the Daewoo
as reporting Wednesday.

The investment will be used in expanding construction of infrastructure at
blocks A-1 and A-3 from where China will buy the gas for 30 years, the Voice

Starting 2013, the China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) will import 7.3 billion
cubic feet (206 million cubic meters) of natural gas daily from block A-1's Shwe
field and Shwe Phyu field and block A-3's Mya field, it said.

The Daewoo International holds 51 percent of stake in the consortium, while ONGC
Videsh Ltd of India 17 percent, GAIL of India 8.5 percent, Korea Gas Crop 8.5
percent and  Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE) 15 percent, it added.

Gas deposit was found at the two blocks by the consortium in January 2004 and
April 2005 respectively.

The Shwe field holds a gas reserve of 4 to 6 trillion cubic feet (TCF) or 113.2
to 170 billion cubic meters (BCM), while the Shwephyu 5 TCF and the Mya 2 TCF
with a combined proven reserve of 5.7 to 10 TCF of gas being estimated by
experts.
