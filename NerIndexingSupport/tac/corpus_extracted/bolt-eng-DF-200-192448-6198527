If you could kick any country out of Europe who would it be and why?
 
 
here it comes.
 
 
It would have to be Sweden. I hate almost everything about their political system and the way they run the country.
 
 
The EU or Europe as a continent?

Why is it whenever this government tries to convince us of something they say “it works in Sweden” “they have a similar system in Sweden” Who gives a toss about Sweden! When somebody says the word Sweden i think of sweetcorn for some reason.
 
 
The EU
 
 
Whatever did those nice gentle Swedes do to you  
 
 
The Swedish are just about the best at everything. I know someone who was in a Swedish hospital. He said it was like being in a 5 star hotel, and he literally walked through the door and was shown straight through to a room where he met a consultant. No wait at all.

Yes but use the argument not the fact that the Swedish do it.

Agreed! I hate it when people try use that argument. And it is usually used to try to support some ridiculous new over-regulation or some pathetic politically-correct socialist argument. If I found out Sweden had floated away overnight I would invite all my friends over and have a party.

Sweden is the most politically-correct country in the world. It is obsessed with green politics, health and safety, unfair equality and discrimination legislation and quotas, regulation and all the other nasty things that are creeping into British politics with this Labour government. That is why I dislike the country so much.

It's hard to believe they were ever Vikings.
 
 
If I had to choose one country to kick out of the European Union, I would choose Poland. The countries religious, right-wing dominated politics is an affront to basic European Union ideals. However, I would not kick them out because I'm optimistic that European integration and EU assisted economic growth would enlighten that part of Europe.

I am also quite wary of Cyprus. Although I would be against kicking them out of the EU, the continuous barriers and pitfalls they set Turkey in its membership negotiations is very frustrating and I agree with Angela Merkel that the EU was wrong to accept Cyprus into the Union at the time it did. I might support a temporary suspension of Cyprus' membership to the Union till they get their act together.

Yes well look at the real unemployment figures here - I mean when you ignore the fact that people can work one and a half days a week and be classed as employed, whilst every other country classes them as unemployed. When you do that, you'll find the gap between us and Sweden is nothing like as great.

Shockingly enough, I was joking. In actual fact, I probably know a great deal more about the European Union than you do - in fact, I'm presently in the stages of planning a dissertation on a matter relating to EC law. You might have noticed from all the exciting and illuminating discussions I've involved myself in on TSR in relation to EU constitutional matters and so forth.

So kindly piss off; you are now added to my long list of complete idiots... oh, wait, you were already on it. I'll just start a list of pseudo-intellectual ******* instead.

Polish society is indeed a very homophobic. It is without a doubt the most intolerant in the Western/developed world, and I don't think it ends with hostility against homosexuals. There's a general homogeneity in Polish society which causes intolerance against most minorities.

Britain - it's widely established that a majority of British people want to leave the EU, and we hold back those countries that want a federal European superstate, so if we get out they can go and do what the heck they like.

Big deal. There are underground gay bars in Iran as well. I know you have a connection with Poland, i think you have Polish ancestry, but you have to stop defending Poland when it comes to issues of tolerance.
 
 
Unfortunately it seems to be Poland's heavily catholic population which gives Poland her homophobic reputation.

I agree. It's ironic because bordering Poland in the south is the Czech Republic, which is arguably the most tolerant country in the EU.

We'd also retain our veto in the UN Security Council, whereas the new IGC EU proposals include the addition of a sixth member, to speak for the EU in common (and thus, for the French and British representatives not to act indepdently them where the EU decides upon common foreign policy), in addition to our capacity to negotiate our trade deals in the WTO, rather than relying on that hideous blockhead Mandelson.

For the EU, of course, there would be the removal of the biggest opponent to more social welfare arrangements and the primary QMV obstructer of French/German initiatives in that, and other, EU competencies - like the 48 hour maximum working week, the French-style 35 hour week, higher EU-wide harmonised minimum wages, the "right to strike" and so on. And, more importantly, the ability to achieve that common security and defence policy to be articulated by the EU UN rep, which Britain's Anglospheric filial ties have hitherto precluded.

Thus, a United States of Europe, as Churchill said, would arise from the ashes of the post-war settlement. But with the important caveat that Britain, whose proximity to the US has for 150 years been closer than that to Europe, would remain outside it, an independent actor uncontrolled by the new European bloc and retaining its national sovereignty.
 
 
Glad you agree.
 
 
Yes, the EU has lots of protectionism, so when are on the outside looking in, what do you think it wil feel like? Would the farmers be around for much longer?

I am half making a point that it would be bad to leave, but half asking a question because you clearly know more than I do.

You do have arguments but mostly they seem to be economic, and there are plenty of economic reasons to stay inside the EU.

What about immigration? If we leave the EU, what do you propose?

But then kicking Britain out of the EU really would be fantastic to symbolise the distinction between the historical British model and the Continental model; one based on  classical liberalism ,  free-trade ,  democracy  &  natural rights  ; the other based on  absolutism ,  collectivism ,  nationalism  and  enslavement to the state .

British farmers aren't competitive, if they trade freely. So by leaving the EU's subsidised agricultural environment, you free up their inefficient labour to be used elsewhere in productive energies.

And it will feel brilliant - protectionism hurts people inside the "protected" nations, not outside it. British consumers will be able to buy European goods (and other international goods) even cheaper than we can now - because French and German taxpayers would be contributing part of the cost of producing the food through their taxation, whilst Brits would retain more of their own money which wasn't taken in such a fashion. It's a perfect solution which doesn't give any special privileges to one economic group (eg. farmers) over another (eg. businessmen).

Since we'll control our own borders, I propose we totally remove the barriers to immigration which the EU imposes; so Turkish and Russian people will be able to enter Britain just as freely as their national neighbours, Lithuanians and Greeks, can now. Of course, that'd have to be the first step in removing welfare protection for immigrants, and gradually weaning the entire population of the (quite brilliantly expressed) "entitlement complex," to which a new topic about Britain referred.

A young educated workforce? A member state which demonstrates that secular democracy can function in a Muslim-majority nation? One of the worlds most powerful military force in the world? A booming economy?

Look, I accept that Turkey has to do a lot more to deserve entry into the European Union. However, I think it's most unhelpful to shut the door in their face at this moment in time. Turkey is the only Western orientated secular democracy in the Muslim world. Its a bridge between the Western world and the Muslim world. To shut the door in Turkeys face now would risk alienating the Western worlds most loyal allies.

Keep going on with the negotiations, provide Turkey with the potential future membership incentive, let them improve themselves and come 2012, 2015, you still don't want them to join, fair enough. We reject their application. But to shut the door in their face now would be a huge mistake.

Lamo... So its ok for Turkey to violate human rights outside the EU? If we tempt them with the prospect of membership they will refrom. If we slam the door they'll cosy up with the middle east.
 
 
The EU should be used as a carrot. By saying we demand reforms before we allow you in, then it's a lot easier to encourage reform.

I agree, but the main reason why a lot of Turkish people are frustrated and angry with the EU is because in terms of economic development, democracy, protection of civil liberties such as freedom of speech and etc, Turkey is on par, if not ahead of recently admitted countries such as Bulgaria and Romania. Many Turks feel that the EU is placing a higher barrier for them, and I think I agree.

Thats exactly what i said the post before you!  

Its because they are Muslim, that's what the fuss is about. Also people believe Turkey will become a be a security risk. Because of the potential for people of middle eastern appearance to slip into Turkey undetected and then into the rest of Europe. Turkish Passports will be very popular in a few years time.

I don't see why they would, no.
 
 
I genuinely despise Sarkozy.

I do slightly blame the European Turkish population though. There are around 5 million Europeans of Turkish origin all over the European Union. They should have more influence over politics, especially in countries such as Germany (where up to 5% of the population are German Turks), France, the UK, the Netherlands, Austria and etc.

But if it is not dealt with within the European Union then it won't get dealt with at all.
 
 
How is the EU a bad thing? Collectively, countries can make a bigger difference. Its not as if we are all about to lose our national identity. Thats happening regardless
 
 
With the EU comes some restrictions. That's what some people would contest over.

To what?

The EU is not about 'making a difference' to anything using collective weight.

and to answer the question:

France
 
 
So what is the EU for? Surely the restrictions are all humanitarian and for the best

It's not a 'silly idea', or even an 'idea' - it's been established in several opinion polls in newspapers I've seen, why on earth is it surprising that a majority of people in this country want to leave the EU? Considering the circulation figures of the Sun, Mail, Express and Telegraph, I would have thought it a reasonable proposition. Anyway, I'm always pleasantly surprised at how much some people know about the corrupt, authoritarian, undemocratic and dysfunctional nature of the EU and how much it works against British interests. In fact, I recall last year at university, a book on the EU published by one of my lecturers showed data (perhaps from Eurobarometer?) showing that in 2003/4, only in 9 out of the then 15 member states did a majority of people want their country to remain in the EU. Obviously that's old data, but it does show just how widely unpopular the EU can be.

I have never come across a single opinion poll where the majority of Brits wanted to leave the EU. I'm sure you'll find many polls where most people do not want to join the Euro or ratify the EU constitution, but none that shows a majority in favour of leaving the EU.
 
 
wouldn't kick any out but if i had to then France. take too much up with the CAP, too negative towards competition and privatisation and under Sarkosy against Turkey entering the EU, when Turkey's benefits of joining completely outweigh the costs of them joining (contrary to what Tufts incorrect view of Turkey is).

Yes they have human rights problems but they can be fixed and as 1984 said economically they will be extremely postive for the EU.

as for UK leaving the EU it makes no sense. You only have to look at reports that show how badly even over a few years it would be if Soctland left the UK. They'd have to apply to join the EU and in the years it will take them to get 'back in' they'll already of felt the economic impact of leaving the EU.

Well that's quite interesting, but still a one off. The vast majority of polls show support for EU membership. I'm not denying that the UK is a Euro-sceptic country, but the majority of the people, most of the time, wish to remain in the EU.

 link  to a Yougov poll, July 2005:

Q2 If a referendum were held and these were the available options, which would you choose?

Britain remaining a member of the European Union – 34%

Britain leaving the European Union and replacing our membership with a free trade agreement – 50%

So basically, join the European Economic Area and for all practical purposes be an EU member except in name and have no say on anything the EU does? Great.

In the end of the day, most people in this country know that the benefits of the EU, outweigh the detriments. In an either/or poll, the majority of Brits almost always state that they would rather the UK continue its membership of the European Union.

So can you now accept then that it is perfectly possible that a majority of people in the UK may want to leave, given that you didn't accept that an opinion poll existed earlier to suggest this, but now you've seen that it does?

Oh, and your first point here is simply wrong. What people want is (shock horror) what they actually signed up for in 1973: a free trade area, or a 'common market' to use the phrase at the time. People are rightly resentful that their elected officials from both Labour and Conservative have systematically lied to them for over 30 years on what the European Project is all about. Nobody ever voted for a 'European Union' with important powers in justice and home affairs, immigration and asylum, foreign policy etc etc etc. What they want is the only sensible option: free trade with Europe which is beneficial for people and the economy as a whole, without being burdened by the £100,000 per hour costs of membership, and having to accept many many thousands of regulations that stifle our businesses, people and general freedoms. Furthermore, you can't really put a price on being governed democratically, which simply isn't the way Britain has governed since we joined the EU. If we had a free trade agreement, we could move back in that direction.

There may be moments of frustration and rising nationalistic sentiments when people are not very supportive of the EU, but in general, the majority of the population does want to stay in the European Union.

Also, you may not be in favour of the EU, but you have to accept that withdrawal from the EU is simply out of question. It will never happen. There has to be an unprecedented incident/event for such a thing to even be foreseeable.

Go on, say it, at least sometimes a majority of people in the UK want to leave the EU, I promise it won't hurt  

On a more serious note, I think you're simply wrong to suggest that people's desire to leave the EU is based on mere frustration or nationalism: the pro-EU side need to accept that there ARE genuine people with genuinely honest and decent reasons for wanting to leave the EU, even if you don't like them, otherwise you're just being disrespectful.

I would definitely say that in the forseeable future the chances of Britain leaving the EU are under 1% because the LibLabCon party are committed to lying to and deceiving the British people about the EU, and (if I can now have my turn in criticising the British people) the people are far too concerned about what's on TV to care about who governs them and how. I'd say that in politics, nothing is impossible. I know one thing for certain though - I'll keep working and fighting hard until the day Britain does leave the EU, no matter how long it takes.

No, I cannot. I would be going against my European tendencies.

How dare you? You must think not I respect not your views (WTF? lol).

Look, I am by no means a Europhile. I can get very frustrated with the EU myself and there have been times when I came close to considering where it would be more beneficial for us to leave. The inward looking members of the EU such as France and Germany can be very annoying. However, I think the majority of people, most of the time, want to stay in the EU.

I don't think it will ever leave. Obviously, its silly to say 'never', but for the time being, its simply out of the question.

Hmm, it may go against your European tendencies, but it also against the truth. Also, it wouldn't be going against your "European tendencies" but your "EU tendencies" - it is perfectly possible to love Europe and despise the EU as I've explained many times.

Do you think, as a comparative argument, that if "most people" in 1938 Austria wanted to re-unify with Germany, they would be justified in compelling the rest of the Austrian population to accept it?

And there are, as Greyhound02 has mentioned, principled reasons to oppose the EU. For me, the EU's protectionism, regulation and collectivist impositions on free trade are enough to merit leaving, never mind its monolothic control-freakery, as in the holocaust-denial and tv-regulation issues the Commission is presently looking at. It has become, in its self-righteous, collectivist arrogance, a form of nationalism of its own.

Well, I don't think the significance of EU membership is on the same level as the unification of two separate states into a single unitary state. member states of the European Union still have considerable freedoms. I don't understand why you use the quotations marks when you say most people. The majority of the British population, most of the time, DOES want to stay in the EU.

You do ask a good question, in so far as, to what extent should the majority be able to govern the destiny of a state, especially if the views of the majority are vehemently opposed by a minority. There's no easy answer.

I recognise your concerns about the EU. It has made a joke of itself with certain regulations put in place, but I think the way forward is to reform to EU rather than withdrawing from it.

That has been said for thirty years without result. Instead we've seen further progression towards a super-state while the big parties dither and lie. We and our other less enthousiatic partners do not have the clout to infuence significantly how the Union develops. The UK, Poland, Czech Republic, Denmark and others do not have enough voting power and are not in the 'cliques' that swing decisions. The best we can do is to secure amendments here and there to shield ourselves from the worst of the damage.

If we were to examine it in such away, I'd have seceded from the United Kingdom a long time ago.

Unfortunately, statehood does not work like that.
 
 
If one country hasn't its place in Europe, I think it would be Great-Britain and they themseves say that, remember Churchill who told De Gaulle that between USA and Commonwealth in the one hand and Europe in the other hand, they'll always choose USA or commowealth...
 
 
If we leave the EU, how are we ever going to be able to change it for the better?

What you say is ridiculous, you speak as English people, and it's normal, maybe you are English. But I am not english and I tell you that in France (for example) we see that Great-Britain isn't like other europeans countries which are in EU. English people are mainly against the european treaty (2005) (you didn't vote against because Nederland and France did it before you), against the euro, and too much "american" like shows the desatrous war in Iraq. (like Spain, Polen, Italy but they aren't in Iraq anymore...)
Compared with Germans, French, I can assert that English people don't feel european.

Are you sure? That's strenge, but I've always thought that it was Monnet, Schuman, Gasperi and Adenauer who founded the EU. (At the beggining, the CECA, in english maybe ACEC, I don't know sorry...) Not Churchill! However, he was Prime Minister in 1951.

Not in a let's-join-the-EU sense, no. But I think he saw Britain's loyalties as lying at least as much with Europe as with the USA. I'm sorry I can't immediately find any quotes for you to back this up - I'll have a look. There's one I remember that involved a man being able one day to walk, unhindered by borders, right across Europe. Which sounds very much like a United States of Euroland; but as I said, he was a politician. It may be a quote taken from an address to a bunch of French bigwigs or something.

I think Churchill would have liked to create a kind of EU, but not a politic union, he didn't want. He just wanted an economic union, that is why Great Britain didn't join the CECA but an other union with Norwege, Iceland, Danmark... (I don't remember the name of this union which doesn't exist nowadays anymore.)

There's some kind of Scandinavian union around these days, but it's probably something different.

EDIT: The "Nordic Council". That was it. Sounds a bit neo-Nazi, doesn't it?

"Why should there not be a European Group which could give a sense of enlarged patriotism?"

—Winston Churchill in Zürich, 19 September 1946

"We hope to see a Europe where men of every country will think as much of being a European as of belonging to their native land, and that without losing any of their love and loyalty of their birthplace. We hope wherever they go in this wide domain, to which we set no limits in the European Continent, they will truly feel 'Here I am at home. I am a citizen of this country too.'"

—Winston Churchill in Amsterdam, Dam Square, 9 May 1948

1. Plenty of Europe was opposed to the Constitutional Treaty. Generally speaking, British people want an effective European Union that can demonstrate itself to be useful before handing it more powers. They generally do not like seeing it take on the symbolism of a country either, which is what annoys us about having European Foreign Ministers and so forth.

2. Yes, we went into Iraq. Just like Spain, Poland, Italy etc. Unlike them, however, we were too far in to cut our losses and run.

There may be some truth in that. By the way, being from Great Britain, I am British, not English... slightly minor point, but it's an annoyance when I'm in France to see exchange rates for the "Livre Anglaise" etc.

The main problem I identify is that many people in Great Britain now associate European identity solely with the European Union, which is - in British popular opinion at least - a bureaucratic, authoritarian and incredibly incompetent regime.

Everyone outside the UK refers to Britain as "England", because they don't know any better. Live with it.

We should eject the nation of Japan out of the European Union because the Japanese authorities refuse to call a halt to the slaughter of whales when there's very little financial, cultural incentive to kill whales, who are one the endangered species list. The dirty ****ing bastards!

The illuminati want to set up a European union, which they have done, a North American union, A Pacific Union and an African Union, all which they will control through a one world government of front organisations such as the UN, Nato etc. The structure of control is the famous illuminati pyramid with the ignorant masses at the base and the ignorant illuminati at the top. The EU was one building block of the New World Order pyramid of world control they would like to build.
