Roy Halladay of the Philadelphia Phillies has unanimously won the National League Cy Young Award, making him the fifth pitcher to earn the honor in the NL and American League.

Halladay pitched a perfect game in May and then threw a no-hitter in the Major League Baseball playoffs. In his first season with the Phillies, he led the NL with 21 wins and topped the majors in innings, shutouts and complete games.

Halladay received all 32 first-place votes in results released on Tuesday by the Baseball Writers' Association of America.

Adam Wainwright of St. Louis was second and Ubaldo Jimenez of Colorado was third. San Francisco ace Tim Lincecum, who won the past two NL Cy Youngs, finished 11th.
