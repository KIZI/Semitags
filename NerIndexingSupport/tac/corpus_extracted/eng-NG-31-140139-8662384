The offical site - video footage

Guys – am I missing something on the site??

I had the selling phone call from ECF a week ago with the free access for £2
for a month and then £40 for the complete year.

The selling point was that there would be live commentary of each match
(which would not interest me) and a video archive of all old matches from
the past six seasons.

I went on this morning expecting to find video footage of the Weymonth game
from Monday – all I can find is footage from the 2001/2002 and 2002/2003
season!

Am I being a ‘silly billy’ and just not found it, of is is simply not there
??

..there hasn't been footage for years.......I didn't know until I had
paid the yearly fee either..........and last year there were quite a
few games that the commentary was not available....including some of
the final games of last year that I was looking forward to listening
to.

You can get commentary with most League and non league games on ANY
club site, so I don't think I will renew with the ECFC site
again......probably with one of my old teams I grew up watching,
Ipswich or Colchester, so I can at least watch footage of their games
and have better access for the fee and still get to listen to City
games (when they broadcast)......

Don't forget the commentaries are available free on the BBC Devon website
anyway :>)

You cannot rely on this Neil.
There was none provided online for the Weymouth game, which was very
frustrating.

they were for a while Neil but were taken off the air a season or two
ago, which was why I subscribed to the "World Site'...........I didn't
know that they were available again..........

overall, it's just not consistant, so it's not worth paying for, and I
doubt the club makes any money off the few subscribers anyways.....I
wouldn't think City would spend any money upgrading the world site for
the sake of few forty quid subscriptions...........

I see a blank Saturday on November 10 in our fixture list.  Is that FA Cup
day?

"they were for a while Neil but were taken off the air a season or two ago,

I circulated a message saying commentaries were back on BBC Radio Devon a
little wile ago Mark, you must have missed it. I speculated as to whether it
was because Torquay were now down with us.
