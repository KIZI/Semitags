Goldikova swept to victory in the Breeders' Cup Mile for the second straight
year Saturday to take her place among racing's greats.

Goldikova emulated the feat of Miesque, who captured back-to-back Mile crowns in
1987-88.

Her trainer Freddy Head had been aboard Miesque for those victories, and
Goldikova's win here last year had already made the 62-year-old the first man to
win a Breeders' Cup race as both a jockey and a trainer.

"She's very special," said Head, who insisted all week that Goldikova was as
good as if not better than Miesque.

"It has been a long season and now to make this long trip in November.

"To have ridden a filly like Miesque is one thing to have trained one like
Goldikova is another.

"She (Goldikova) is extraordinary and what a burst of speed she had!" added
Head, son of legendary trainer Alec and brother of well respected trainer
Criquette.

Courageous Cat, a 33-1 shot trained by Bill Mott and ridden by Garrett Gomez,
was second, and Justenuffhumor, trained by Kiaran McLaughlin and ridden by Alan
Garcia, was third.

Peslier had to overcome Goldikova's unfavourable draw in the outside 11th post.
She was second-to-last after a quarter of a mile as Gladiatorus set the early
pace.

When Goldikova at last made her move, she powered to the front for the win.

"The draw wasn't a big help," Peslier said. "I didn't want to make a run until
the last turn. I came wide because that was the only place to go. She's lovely.

"She won last year. She won this year. I'm glad for my owners that they have a
filly like this."

Courageous Cat headed the field coming into the final straight.

"I thought we might win it," Mott said. "He looked like a winner. He ran a
winning race. He's a 3-year-old colt that is a little tender experience-wise and
he nearly beat last year's Breeder's Cup Mile champion."

Added Gomez: "He ran his eyeballs out. He kept digging, but the filly was just
too good."
