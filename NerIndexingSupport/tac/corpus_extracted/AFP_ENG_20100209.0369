Haiti's quake battered and greatly diminished weather service urgently needs
help ahead of the flood and storm prone country's impending rainy season, the
UN's weather agency said on Tuesday.

"We feel there is absolutely no time to waste and it's very important to help
Haiti to be as ready as possible," said World Meteorological Organisation
Secretary General Michel Jarraud, referring to the National Meteorological
Centre of Haiti.

While the quake last month left some 200,000 dead and about one million
homeless, 90 percent of Haiti's disasters, including floods and drought, are
triggered by extreme climatic conditions, according to the WMO.

The rainy season is looming in April and hurricanes are normally due from June.
In 2008 Haiti was exceptionally struck by four hurricanes in succession.

The WMO said the Caribbean nation's geographical vulnerability was amplified by
deforestation in recent years, increasing the risk of mudslides and flooding.

"It is something which is a major hazard in a normal situation but now the
hazards will be even more important, because most buildings considered as
potential shelters or resistant were destroyed or severely damaged," Jarraud
told journalists in Geneva.

Thousands of poor people in makeshift shantytowns on flood plains and coastal
areas were also vulnerable, and adequate weather and evacuation warnings were
needed, WMO officials warned.

The earthquake devastated the national weather service's office in the capital
Port-au-Prince, relegating some 21 meteorological specialists to a tent on the
airport tarmac and disrupting a nationwide network of volunteers.

"When there are floods and when there is a hurricane, a clear voice is needed
saying 'this is an emergency and these are the actions to take'," said WMO
development director Robert Masters.

Essential weather forecasts for the country have been provided by Canada,
neighbouring Dominican Republic, France and the United States since the quake
struck on January 12.

The WMO has also called on countries due to meet in a regional hurricane
committee next month, as well as UN agencies, for longer term help.

It estimated that about one million dollars in emergency aid was needed to prop
up basic weather services within months, as well as another 15 million dollars
in longer term aid.
