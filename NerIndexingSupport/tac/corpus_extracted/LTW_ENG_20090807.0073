It's that, with relatively little else happening, the darndest people
and causes tend to grab the spotlight. This time last year, we were hearing
a lot about the Puma PAC, an obstreperous group of Hillary Rodham Clinton
supporters who somehow believed that throwing their votes to John McCain
showed more loyalty to Clinton and her issues than supporting the Democratic
presidential nominee. The year before that, there was the opportunistic
display surrounding the 10th anniversary of Princess Diana's death -- that
means you, Larry King. The year before that, Madonna fell off her horse and
it seemed no one would shut up about it until Hurricane Katrina came
along.

You've heard the term "august personage." This refers to an eminent or
venerable figure. I am hereby coining a slight and notably downscale
variation on this label: the August personality.

Neither eminent nor venerable, August personalities are the unopposed
candidates of the public sphere. They gain traction because they're just
nonsensical and bizarre enough to fit the "man bites dog" profile and, oh
yes, no one else bothered to show up. August personalities tend to have both
an ax to grind and a chip on their shoulders. Undaunted by the foolishness
of their 15 minutes, they are thrilled to be in the national media, no
matter how low the vacation ratings go.

At any other time of the year, they would be relegated to the outer
limits of cable access and the Internet. But it being August, August
personalities wind up on prime time. With all the shrinks out of town, the
country goes a little bit crazy.

This year's August personality? Orly Taitz, the woman spearheading the
campaign behind the apparently unvanquishable issue of President Barack
Obama's country of birth. A dentist/lawyer/real estate agent turned
"eligibility activist" from Laguna Niguel, Calif., Taitz looks like a cross
between Dr. Laura and Carol Channing and sounds like a 16-year-old Zsa Zsa
Gabor fighting with her mom about her curfew. Her movement's mission, of
course, is to show that the president was not born in Hawaii, as has been
exhaustively proved by officials from that state, but in Kenya and is
therefore ineligible to serve as commander in chief.

Were it any other month, you probably wouldn't be seeing so much of
Taitz. You probably would have to seek out her Web site or go to the
far-right news site World Net Daily, which is collecting signatures for an
online petition related to the issue. (A "Where's the birth certificate?"
billboard on a freeway near downtown Los Angeles is part of it.)

But in the past few weeks, Taitz has appeared on CNN, Fox News and "The
Colbert Report," where she likened the Obama administration to Nazi Germany
and apparently took her host seriously when he remarked how refreshing it
was to hear someone make the comparison. "Really? I have even more
information,"  Taitz said, before pointing to documents she claimed proved
that the president's Social Security number was issued in Connecticut and
showed him to be 190 years old.

OK, because everyone's such a stickler for details, I guess I should
point that that some of these interviews, including the Colbert exchange,
took place at the end of July, the official throat-clearing period for
August personalities. But Taitz's true breakout moment came  Monday, when
she appeared on MSNBC. Revealing a debilitating strain of defensiveness
straight out of the gate, Taitz responded to anchor David Shuster's first
question -- about the Obama birth announcement printed in two Honolulu
newspapers -- by asking how much time she would have to respond because she
had "had a bad experience on CNN." She went on to tell Shuster that "you
need to display some decency and integrity as a journalist" and  that people
are "sick of the lies coming from the mainstream media," which she referred
to as "Obama brownshirts."

The interview unraveled into a shouting match between Taitz, Shuster and
co-host Tamron Hall and within minutes was ricocheting around the
blogosphere, amid a lot of cackling about Taitz's mental state.

Is she certifiable? Only a 190-year-old Connecticut man would know for
sure. What is certain is that every August (come home, shrinks!), the
public's wackadoo threshold reliably goes up. And although we can only hope
that next year's August personality won't be quite as xenophobic as Taitz,
you have to admit she's pretty entertaining, in a summer-disaster-movie kind
of way.

But let it be said, she's not as enjoyable as a good book and an iced
tea on the deck. That would be August minus the personality. Dare to dream,
people.
