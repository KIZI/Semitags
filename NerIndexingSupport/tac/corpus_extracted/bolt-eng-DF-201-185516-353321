 
 
The Role of The Press and the birth certificate
 
 
Regardless of your position on the issue, since it is a lingering, nagging and persistent question, at least with some,

why has no one in the press ever just directly asked President Obama concerning the matter?

Do you think any journalists should or should not do so and why or why not?
 
 
At least some people are idiots and shouldn't be pandered to.

Eta: Ignoring of course the   false assumption underlying the question .
 
 
When a member of the press gets a chance to ask Obama a question, why should they waste it on a question that stupid?
 
 
He's been asked many times and given the correct answers. And the only reason this question is "nagging and persistent" is because idiots can be nagging and persistent, even if they only have two brain cells that don't like each other.
 
 
 
Regardless of your position on the issue...

 
And the fact that there is a "position on the issue" only goes to show that people are stupid.
 
 
 
He's been asked many times and given the correct answers.

 
Obama has been asked directly? I missed it. Link?
 
 
 
Regardless of your position on the issue,

 
It is not an issue. It is a documented fact.

 
why has no one in the press ever just directly asked President Obama concerning the matter?

 
How exactly do you picture such an exchange

Case 1)
reporter: "where were you born?"
Obama: " I was born in Hawaii. Hawaiian officials have repeatedly and consistently reported that there is documentation of my birth in that state. I have provided my birth certificate. Fifty different secretaries of state checked my credentials before placing me on fifty different state ballots."

Case 2)
reporter: "where were you born?"
Obama: "I was born in Kenya. I am surprised it took this long for anyone to ask, but because I cannot lie to a reporter, I am confessing my charade. I announce my resignation. I will now surrender to Special Agent Jethro Gibbs who will place me under arrest."
 
 
 
Do you think any journalists should or should not do so and why or why not?

 
Groundless character assassination is an ugly and dishonest tactic that journalists should refuse to play into. That's obvious to just about everyone, which makes me wonder why you would even bother to ask.
 
 
I think asking him if the issue has caused him any discomfort--perhaps in his home--might be something worth asking.
 
 
It's only an issue to people with a retarded mental capacity.

America, I love you, but you're bringing me down.
 
 
 
Do you think any journalists should or should not do so and why or why not?

 
Why should they bother? The eviudence has been available for more than two years. The only reason there is a question is that a few psychotics keep it in the public eye.

Mostly because the president provided his birth certificate publically years ago. Any lingering questions on the matter are just a denial of evidence. What good would more evidence be?
 
 
The press should be reminding the public just how disconnected the birthers are from reality.

Flip this around. There are a large number of responsible, objective and inteligent journalists out there.

Should the fact that none of them has "run with" this story clue you in on the validity of said "story?"

The birthers just can't accept that the US elected a black man as President. It offends their deeply held belief that only white men have the right to that office. If we had elected Hillary Clinton in 2008, these same folks would be searching for a way to deny that we legitimately elected a women.
 
 
On his last census form, Obama listed his race as "African-American." Why would he say "african" if he was born in Hawaii? Hmmm?

Some reporter should ask him about that.

That's interesting because it's true (AMY tm). It probably deserves a thread of its own, but shouldn't he list himself as a Pacific Islander?

If they asked him directly, it would pretty much be carpet-bombing their own--and by extension, their network's--credibility. There's no need to ask him directly since the question has been handled and handled again. Besides that, currently, we are in an ongoing war that we have been involved in for quite some time, we are expected to contain and mitigate the unrest and brutality in Libya, and we are still mired in one of the greatest economic crises in history. And you want a reporter to ask the President if he was really born in America, or if he's just saying that to mess with us. And you expect us to take that desire seriously.

You posted this thread. There's no point in asking you why you haven't done it, or where your real thread with that title is, or even what you think about all those people who don't believe you've actually posted this thread. Those are, in fact, stupid questions, and therefore there's no reason to ask them, especially in the context of a serious discussion.

Obama has released his birth certificate. There's no point in asking him why he hasn't done it, or where his real birth certificate is, or even what he thinks about all those people who don't believe he's actually released it. Those are, in fact, stupid questions, and therefore there's no reason to ask them, especially in the context of serious journalism.

I have been evaluated by three different panels of mental health experts and been found sane enough to posess firearms, so it stands to reason that I would side with Obama on issues like this.
 
 
 
Are you a Democrat/Obama voter/Obama supporter?

 
No/yes/not sure what you mean by "support". I don't like everything he's done, but I don't dislike everything he's done, and some things he's done I don't like or dislike. Does that count as "support"?
 
 
 
Are you a Democrat/Obama voter/Obama supporter?

 
I'm not a Democrat, I didn't vote for Obama, and I support some things he's done and am pretty angry at other things he's done.

Now that I've answered your question, answer this one for me: what does that have to do with the fact that more than two years ago Obama released his state-certified, state- verified birth certificate showing when and where he was born, thus making any further "questions" about his birth or the certificate thereof beyond pointlessly stupid.

Brian Williams has, see here -

No.

Your original post is incorrect (see above) and continued questions about the President's birthplace are unseemly and uncalled for.

Yes/no/sometimes.

Your turn. Why do you think it's relevant on any level for a member of the press to sacrifice his or her credibility to try to satisfy the demands of a howling percentage of the population when there are immeasurably more important matters to be attended to? And for that matter, why do you think it necessary that a member of the press ask a question that has already been answered several times over?
 
 
 
Are you serious? Obviously, I did.

Are you serious? So are you saying that anyone in the press has ever directly asked Obama about the birth certificate question? ANTPogo, please show me where ANYONE has EVER ASKED OBAMA DIRECTLY about his birth certificate.

 
See Alfred above. Why do you doubt that he has been asked this? The campaign made a big deal about releasing the certificate (with the raised and embossed seal from the state of Hawaii) to the press....  http://msgboard.snopes.com/politics/graphics/birth.jpg ... So, should Obama have to address this issue repeatedly because morons refuse to believe facts?

But, what is your agenda here? Do you doubt that Obama was born in the U.S.? If you believe that he was, why asking this question? What does it matter? If you don't why don't you, especially given the universal refutiation of all birther "facts" by anyone and eveyone (sane) who has looked at the issue?

What facts/lack of facts bother you and why?

Do you, for example, subscribe to the theory that the State of Hawaii is lying when it says the document it issues -- the only document it issues -- is proof that Obama was born in Hawaii? Are all Hawaiian birth certificates suspect in your mind?

What is your agenda here?
 
 
Are you a Nazi or a white supremacist? Are you a moron or a credulous fool? Are you a troll or a sockpuppet?

Yes, I voted for Obama and support many but not all of the things he has done as president. Please help me to understand what my political affiliation has to do with your OP. Remember, the than Republican Hawaiian Secretary of Health attested to the vailidity of the Birth Certificate. What is your point? What is your agenda?
 
 
Both Hillary Clinton and John McCain believe Obama was born in Hawaii and is an eligible U.S. citizen. Can you name any two people in the entire country with less reason to believe Obama's birth certificate?

Are you a conspiracy theorist? I ask because you would have to be if you think 20+ Republican secretaries of state put Obama on the ballot. It's OK if you are one. We just have to move the thread to the appropriate forum.
 
 
 
Do you, for example, subscribe to the theory that the State of Hawaii is lying when it says the document it issues -- the only document it issues [the only document it is allowed to issue by law] -- is proof that Obama was born in Hawaii? Are all Hawaiian birth certificates suspect in your mind?

What is your agenda here?

 
I added a phrase
 
 
Indeed and in fact, not only the only document it issues under law...but one that EVERY state in the union must rely on and accept BY LAW for the purposes of proving birth and identification. Also the only document a court would rely on regardless of jurisdiction, for the puroposes of proving birht. As is also true for the federal government in the issuing of passports, or other federal documents.

What do you say is the role of the press in the United States of America?
 
 
 
How is that relevant? Either the man has posted evidence of his birth certificate and nationality or he hasn't.

 
I'm just asking because I would like to know. I find the consistency of responses interesting and revealing.
 
Do you have any reason to reject the evidence as it has already been presented?

 
I haven't seen inarguable evidence presented.

 
Obama has released his birth certificate. There's no point in asking him why he hasn't done it, or where his real birth certificate is, or even what he thinks about all those people who don't believe he's actually released it. Those are, in fact, stupid questions, and therefore there's no reason to ask them, especially in the context of serious journalism.

 
My understanding is that he has issued a copy of his certificate of live birth which is not the same as his actual birth certificate, and that there are serious questions concerning the legitimacy of even that document. I also understand that some deliberately refuse to consider and acknowledge that distinction, for whatever their own reasons.

 
Do you have an example of a reporter asking George W. Bush if he was really born in america?

 
No. I also am not aware of anyone seriously questioning it. I would have no objection to any individual or member of the press asking Bush directly if they felt it necessary for any reason. Would you?

 
Now that I've answered your question, answer this one for me: what does that have to do with the fact that more than two years ago Obama released his state-certified, state- verified birth certificate showing when and where he was born, thus making any further "questions" about his birth or the certificate thereof beyond pointlessly stupid.

 
As I answered above to you. "Stupid" to "beyond pointlessly stupid" noted.
 
 
 
My understanding is that he has issued a copy of his certificate of live birth which is not the same as his actual birth certificate, and that there are serious questions concerning the legitimacy of even that document. I also understand that some deliberately refuse to consider and acknowledge that distinction, for whatever their own reasons.

 
Can you outline the distinction that you think is important?

As previous posters have pointed out, the released document is recognized by the State Department as part of a passport application. In fact, every department of the federal government recognizes this form. Every state government recognizes this form. In short, everyone recognizes this form.

Also, please itemize the "serious questions concerning the legitimacy of even that document."
 
 
And so another birther outs himself.
 
 
 
Brian Williams has, see here -

 
Brian Williams did not ask Obama where he was born. Obama's answer does not say where he was born.

Obama said "Well, look, the facts are the facts, and so we went through some of this during the campaign. Um, you know, there is a mechanism, uh, a network of misinformation that in a new media era can get churned out there constantly. Um, we dealt with this when I was first running for the U.S. Senate. We dealt with it when we were first running for the presidency. There were those who said I couldn't win as U.S. senator because I had a funny name, and yet we ended up winning that senate seat in Illinois because I trusted in the American people's capacity to get beyond all this nonsense and so I will always put my money on the American people and I'm not gonna be worrying too much about whatever rumors are floating out there. If I spend all my time chasing after that, I wouldn't get much done... Well, look Brian, I would say that I can't spend all my time with my birth certificate plastered on my forehead. It is what, the facts are the facts, and so it's not something that I can I think spend all my time worrying about and I don't think the American people want me to spend all my time worrying about."

Obama was not asked and did not answer where he was born.

 
Your original post is incorrect (see above) and continued questions about the President's birthplace are unseemly and uncalled for.

 
I disagree. You have a right to your opinion and I still have a right to mine.
 
 
 
I'm just asking because I would like to know. I find the consistency of responses interesting and revealing.

 
An intelligent rational person may wonder if the consistency of the responses reveals something about themselves rather than the responders. This though assumes two things about you which are not in evidence.
 
 
 
Your turn. Why do you think it's relevant on any level for a member of the press to sacrifice his or her credibility to try to satisfy the demands of a howling percentage of the population when there are immeasurably more important matters to be attended to?

 
Apparently we have different standards of sacrifices for credibility.
 
And for that matter, why do you think it necessary that a member of the press ask a question that has already been answered several times over?

 
It has not been asked of or answered by Barack Obama.
 
 
 
I haven't seen inarguable evidence presented.

 
You'd have to really try to not have seen the evidence by this point. Regardless, David did, in fact, present the evidence:

 
 http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama...ertificate.asp 

 
 
 
 
I'm just asking because I would like to know. I find the consistency of responses interesting and revealing.

 
Well, I'll give you this, you certainly are consistent. Both in this and the thread about Beck, you've consistently ignored evidence that challenges your beliefs.
 
 
 
I haven't seen inarguable evidence presented

 
Why does the evidence have to be "inarguable" anyway? Should the detractors of these inane conspiracy theories simply assume that you'll continuously deny evidence presented to you on the basis that a conceivable counter-argument exists regardless of its quality?
 
 
 
But, what is your agenda here?

 
I simply would like to know the truth of the matter. That is my "agenda."
 
Do you doubt that Obama was born in the U.S.?

 
I don't know but I do think it is entirely possible that he was not.
 
If you believe that he was, why asking this question? What does it matter?

 
It is extremely important and it matters a great deal, or at least it should.
 
If you don't why don't you, especially given the universal refutiation of all birther "facts" by anyone and eveyone (sane) who has looked at the issue?

 
It is not "universal" no matter how many people seek to likewise dismiss the dissent. This thread is a perfect microcosm of the apparent vast majority of those on the left in the nation. Those that disagree are personally disparaged and their arguments are always vilified. It is the Standard Operating Procedure.

 
Do you, for example, subscribe to the theory that the State of Hawaii is lying when it says the document it issues -- the only document it issues -- is proof that Obama was born in Hawaii?

 
I would like to see some courageous member of the press investigate and question some state officials of Hawaii.
 
Are all Hawaiian birth certificates suspect in your mind?

 
No.

 
What is your agenda here?

 
Again, still, only the truth, wherever it may lead and whatever it may be.

 
I think it would be stupid for a reporter to raise the question as only an idiot could think there is an issue here.

 
Of course, only an idiot birther wingnutbag whackjob racist radical extremist. I know. Of course.

 
Can you outline the distinction that you think is important?... Also, please itemize the "serious questions concerning the legitimacy of even that document."

 
No, you can easily find others that have done so. I will not bother. If you do not accept and will not consider what they have found and what they say, you certainly will not be persuaded by me. And I'm not making their case anyway. I am not conclusively persuaded by any answers available thus far. I question everyone, including those who are so certain they have the answers.

 
And so another birther outs himself.

 
There it is. I do not know the truth of the matter. I want to know the truth of the matter. With some, with frighteningly many, it is wrong to want to pursue the truth of the matter and anyone who is open to doing so must be personally disparaged. Standard Operating Procedure.
 
 
 
Are you serious? Obviously, I did.

 
Look, calm down. All we are asking is that you start a thread entitled "The Role of The Press and the birth certificate". It is a simple procedure. Stop evading the issue.
 
 
 
I don't know but I do think it is entirely possible that he was not.

 
You do? Even after being presented with evidence of his place of birth? Why?
 
 
 
Brian Williams did not ask Obama where he was born. Obama's answer does not say where he was born.

Obama was not asked and did not answer where he was born.

 
That is a lie.

The first lines of the linked interview are :

Interviewer : "Mr President, you are an American born Christian?"
Obama : "Uh huh." <nods>

Question asked, question answered.
 
 
 
An intelligent rational person may wonder if the consistency of the responses reveals something about themselves rather than the responders. This though assumes two things about you which are not in evidence.

 
Of course. Like I said.

 
Well, I'll give you this, you certainly are consistent. Both in this and the thread about Beck, you've consistently ignored evidence that challenges your beliefs.

 
I am ignoring nothing. That I do not accept what you swallow does not mean I ignore. It means we differ. It means we have arrived at different conclusions. For whatever your reason, you refuse to allow that of me. You apparently allow for no other legitimate opinion than your own. Leftists never do.

Perhaps because you refuse to actually explain why you reject the evidence presented to you or, in most cases, acknowledge its existence. What differing conclusion do you draw from Obama's  Birth   Certificate  ? How does his birth certificate, which certifies that he was born in Hawaii, allow any possibility that he was not born in the US?

 
You apparently allow for no other legitimate opinion than your own. Leftists never do.

 
You assume I'm a leftist? Why?

ETA: An opinion that is in contradiction to the facts isn't legitimate. It has nothing to do with not agreeing with my opinion.
 
 
 
Why does the evidence have to be "inarguable" anyway?

 
Would you prefer "conclusive"?
 
Should the detractors of these inane conspiracy theories simply assume that you'll continuously deny evidence presented to you on the basis that a conceivable counter-argument exists regardless of its quality?

 
"Inane"... We have no conclusive evidence. We do not even have the question posed directly to the man who can certainly give the answer.

If and when required, I can answer the question simply, honestly and directly and I can provide my birth certificate without any hesitation, obfuscation or evasion and without employing attorneys.
 
 
 
Would you prefer "conclusive"? "Inane"... We have no conclusive evidence.

 
 Yes, we do. 

You are allowed to have your own opinions, not your own facts.
 
 
 
You do? Even after being presented with evidence of his place of birth? Why?

 
Is this evidence? I don't know... but you do.

"The Evidence

In this case, the Democrat Party was responsible for vetting and certifying Barack Hussein Obama as legally eligible to seek the Oval Office. The U.S. Constitution has only three very specific requirements for the job. The proper legal text used on the DNC Party Official Certification of Nomination document reads as follows, and I quote;

THIS IS TO CERTIFY that at the National Convention of the Democrat Party of the United States of America, held in Denver, Colorado on August 25 through 28, 2008, the following were duly nominated as candidates of said Party for President and Vice President of the United States respectively and that the following candidates for President and Vice President of the United States are legally qualified to serve under the provisions of the United States Constitution.

The document is signed by Chair of the DNC Convention and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, DNC Secretary Alice Travis Germond and Colorado Notary of Public Shalifa A. Williamson. It is dated August 28, 2008.

However, this document was never delivered to a single state DNC Office for state certification, and it was therefore, never presented to any state Election Commission as certification of these candidates, although I do have a copy of this notarized document myself.

Instead, a very similar document was delivered to fifty state DNC offices, which those offices certified to each of fifty state Election Commissions, who then date-stamped the document and stuck it in a file cabinet, and proceeded to place these certified candidates on the ballot.

The Official Certification of Nomination that was presented by the DNC in all fifty states for the 2008 Presidential election, in which Barack Hussein Obama became the new President of the United States, was almost identical, and it too was signed by Chair of the DNC Convention and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, DNC Secretary Alice Travis Germond and Notary of Public Shalifa A. Williamson, dated August 28, 2008.

But this version of the document was missing the following text, and I quote;

- and that the following candidates for President and Vice President of the United States are legally qualified to serve under the provisions of the United States Constitution.
 
 
The obvious JREF consensus thus far seems to clearly be that the press should not ask Obama directly concerning his birth.

Would any of you likewise find it inappropriate and unacceptable for a investigative journalist among the press to ask Nancy Pelosi about the DNC Official Certification of Nomination of Barack Obama for President of the United States of America that she signed?

Would that be a fair expectation within the role of the press?
 
 
You still haven't addressed the fact that you have been provided his both certificate in living color.

So far, you've provided a fake Kenya sign (ignored) and a document that does says nothing about Obama's place of birth one way or the other.
 
 
Why is this conspiracy theory not in the Conspiracy Theory forum?
 
 
 
The obvious JREF consensus thus far seems to clearly be that the press should not ask Obama directly concerning his birth.

 
Except that he has been asked and Obama has gone out of his way to provide show that he is a natural born citizen. Your entire premise is flawed and misinformed.
 
 
 
I didn't,  but Snopes did .

eta: I know you aren't a fan of actually looking at the evidence provided, so I'll cut to the chase. Here is the original of that Photoshop job you posted:
 http://msgboard.snopes.com/politics/...kenyasign2.jpg 

 
I would look into it further before confidently accepting this dismissal as conclusive, but if it is in fact false, I have absolutely no objection to its rejection. None whatsoever. I have no objections to the truth, whatever it may be.
 
 
 
The obvious JREF consensus thus far seems to clearly be that the press should not ask Obama directly concerning his birth.

 
No. The JREF concensus is that the press HAS asked him and his answer was satisfactory, even to his biggest rivals.

 
Would any of you likewise find it inappropriate and unacceptable for a investigative journalist among the press to ask Nancy Pelosi about the DNC Official Certification of Nomination of Barack Obama for President of the United States of America that she signed?

 
Are you suggesting it was fake? What exactly do you think an "investigative journalist" is? Do you think it is somebody who asks the same questions which have already been answered and are no longer in question to anyone other than conspiracy theorists? True investigative journalists look for evidence. When they find it, they report. Nobody has any evidence that Obama's birth certificate (or his nomination documentation) is anything other than legitimate.

 
Would that be a fair expectation within the role of the press?

 
The press, for the most part, are not questioning Obama's citizenship. There are, however, a number of very vocal bloggers who are screaming their adenoids out about it. But you see, there are no qualifications to become a blogger. All you need is a website and a burr up your ass.

DavidJames?

Tricky, what do you think? Do you think it would be fair and reasonable to expect someone in the press to ask Nancy Pelosi about the DNC Official Certification of Nomination?
 
 
Even investigative reporter Bill O'Reilly believes Obama is a U.S. citizen.
 
 
Jude, have you read  this link?  (It's been posted twice already)

If so, do you find the evidence presented therein to be insufficient? Why?
 
 
 
Do you think it would be fair and reasonable to expect someone in the press to ask Nancy Pelosi about the DNC Official Certification of Nomination?

 
It is inconsequential. Obama has been shown to be a natural born US citizen. Of what importance is this document?
 
 
 
My understanding is that he has issued a copy of his certificate of live birth which is not the same as his actual birth certificate,

 
It's not?

So why does my birth certificate say "certificate of live birth" on it? I've had this copy since I was born in 1966. What does yours say?
 
 
 
Tricky, what do you think? Do you think it would be fair and reasonable to expect someone in the press to ask Nancy Pelosi about the DNC Official Certification of Nomination?

 
I'm not sure. What do you think they should ask? Do you see anything questionable? If so, what?
 
 
I'm curious and open to considering any possible answer. If the above quoted is true, can any one of you suggest any good reason why this part would be removed from the the DNC Official Certification of Nomination?

If it was removed, and I don't know whether or not it was, then it was probably removed because it was completely useless. Nobody would get to the point of being certified as nominated without having their eligibility thoroughly checked. And it has been checked more thoroughly for Obama than for any other candidate.

Now, are you proposing that someone removed something from the nomination form in order to keep from lying about his eligibility? Seriously, are you really suggesting something this ridiculous? If not, what exactly is your point?
 
 
 
It's not?

So why does my birth certificate say "certificate of live birth" on it? I've had this copy since I was born in 1966. What does yours say?

 
Wait a minute. I have not been bothering to read jude's idiotic rantings, but has he really suggested that a "Certificate of live birth" is NOT a birth certificate?

What in the bloody heck else would it take? It is a document that certifies his birth. That is a birth certificate. Saying that he was alive at the time when he was born somehow contradicts that?

Honestly, how disconnected does someone have to be to seriously argue that a "certificate of live birth" is not a birth certificate?

"...The Obama "Fight the Smears" website has published a digital photograph of a short-form "Certification of Live Birth" issued by the Hawaiian Department of Health that lists his place and date of birth as Honolulu on August 4, 1961. At that time, Hawaii''s practice was to issue also a long-form Certificate of Live Birth which contains more information, including the name of the hospital, or address of the place, where the birth occurred; the identity of the physician or other "attendant" at the birth; and the signature of the parent or other ''informant" certifying the accuracy of the information, etc. President Obama has not given the permission required by Hawaiian law for release of that long-form certificate. "

"Numerous lawsuits challenging Obama's eligibility have been rejected by every court involved, including the Supreme Court of the United States. Some are still pending. The rejections have been based on various grounds, including the plaintiff''s lack of standing to sue and other specified and unspecified procedural grounds. No court has agreed to decide any of those suits on the merits. "

"...I suggest no conclusion as to whether Obama is eligible or not. But the citizens whom the media and political pundits dismiss as "birthers" have raised legitimate questions. That legitimacy is fueled by Obama''s curious, even bizarre, refusal to consent to the release of the relevant records. Perhaps there is nothing to the issues raised. Or perhaps there is. This is potentially serious business. If it turns out that Obama knew he was ineligible when he campaigned and when he took the oath as President, it could be the biggest political fraud in the history of the world. As long as Obama refuses to disclose the records, speculation will grow and grow without any necessary relation to the truth. The first step toward resolving the issue is full discovery and disclosure of the facts."
 
 
Just goes to show that even professors at prestigeous religious universities can be Obama-haters. Charles E. Rice has provided no evidence whatsoever that there is anything unusual going on, and the Supreme Court has tossed out every challenge of Obama's legitimacy. (Remember, the Supreme Court is still a majority of Republican appointees.)

So there is still nothing. Everybody who has had a good, or even partisan, reason to try to sideline Obama has accepted the legitimacy of his citizenship. Either this is an incredible bipartisan conspiracy of Obama's supportors and detractors who have put aside their differences in order to perpetuate a lie to the American People in order to advance some anti-American agenda, or it is a complete load of bollocks that anyone with a minimally functioning brain could see through.
I'm a little dismayed to see that so many Americans don't have the mental capacity to do this.
 
 
 
Jude, have you read  this link?  (It's been posted twice already)

If so, do you find the evidence presented therein to be insufficient? Why?

 
Jude, you have been accused, on multiple threads covering multiple subjects, of repeatedly ignoring the evidence that you have asked for. When you ignore very simple posts like the quoted one above, it's no wonder.
 
 
 
Tricky, what do you think? Do you think it would be fair and reasonable to expect someone in the press to ask Nancy Pelosi about the DNC Official Certification of Nomination?

 
Why does every raving lunatic deserve to have his niggling little doubts satisfied?

There exist legal documents to the effect that Obama was born in Hawaii. There is no evidence that he was born elsewhere.

Birfers need to stop bothering the adults.

But he has published the short form, which settles the question.

 
"...I suggest no conclusion as to whether Obama is eligible or not. But the citizens whom the media and political pundits dismiss as "birthers" have raised legitimate questions.

 
Which legitimate questions have they raised? I've never seen one.

 
As long as Obama refuses to disclose the records, speculation will grow and grow without any necessary relation to the truth. The first step toward resolving the issue is full discovery and disclosure of the facts."

 
This is true but incomplete. It needs to go on to add that speculation will ALSO continue to grow if Obama does (assuming he even can) release some other form of his birth certificate. Birthers would simply say it was faked, or come up with some other requirement for him to fulfill. There is literally no evidence that Obama could present that would stop this issue.

And given that, why should he bother? Why give up the political initiative and dance to the tune of enemies who will never be satisfied but only demand a bigger, more elaborate dance?
 
 
 
Look, calm down. All we are asking is that you start a thread entitled "The Role of The Press and the birth certificate". It is a simple procedure. Stop evading the issue.

 
I find it revealing that nobody on JREF has asked Jude Brando whether he has started a thread entitled "The Role of The Press and the birth certificate". Does anybody think it should be the responsibility of JREF members to ask him this question?

Dave
 
 
So, Jude is not merely a misinformed and gullible JAQer, but also a full-on Birther, huh?

Well, this answers my question from another thread about whether he plans on wasting my time.
 
 
At this point, I don't care if he was born here or not. If the Republican party was so incompetent, so amateurish, so bush-league, so inept as to not get this resolved before 2011, then they don't deserve the presidency. If "an effete corps of impudent snobs who characterize themselves as intellectuals" can put an impostor in the White House, then I say more power to them.

I, for one, welcome our new Kenyan overlord.
 
 
 
If we had elected Hillary Clinton in 2008, these same folks would be searching for a way to deny that we legitimately elected a women.

 
Since the USA is not located on Venus, I think it's pretty obvious that Hilary Clinton cannot be a US citizen.
 
 
 
What do you say is the role of the press in the United States of America?

 
It's more of a biscuit than a role.

Mmmm. Biscuits...
 
 
 
Now, are you proposing that someone removed something from the nomination form in order to keep from lying about his eligibility? Seriously, are you really suggesting something this ridiculous? If not, what exactly is your point?

 
Sounds like that is what he is saying.

So this massive conspiracy has been in place since Obama's birth, but the Democratic Party -- a political party -- had to leave that phrase out to keep themselves from lying. The massive conspiracy has been in place since he was born, but it would all crumble apart if a reporter asked him the same question again, because he would be incapable of lying about it.

If you can't follow the simple logic there...well, good.

 
Honestly, how disconnected does someone have to be to seriously argue that a "certificate of live birth" is not a birth certificate?

 
That does seem to be the whole of the argument.

I'm curious as to how many birthers could produce such a document for themselves. Can Jude Brando? If it's not the original, signed by the doctor who delivered him, then it doesn't count and I'll assume he was born in Kenya.

I know that if I need a copy of a birth certificate, I go and get a version that the county prints on the spot. I do not recall anyone prior to Obama's campaign suggesting that a valid birth certificate had to be anything other than what the state normally produces for its citizens.

 
I find it revealing that nobody on JREF has asked Jude Brando whether he has started a thread entitled "The Role of The Press and the birth certificate". Does anybody think it should be the responsibility of JREF members to ask him this question?

Dave

 
I would like to know why he keeps evading the question. Jude Brando, why can't you do this?

(And for proof, I really need to see his original long form post on the thread, verified by James Randi.)
 
 
 
President Obama has not given the permission required by Hawaiian law for release of that long-form certificate. "

 
Except that there is no provision under current Hawaiian law for this. Hawaii isn't refusing to release the "long-form certificate" because Obama hasn't given his permission.

Hawaii is refusing to release the "long-form certificate" because even if Obama tells them to release it, they can't under the laws as they currently stand.

The law says you can get one of three things: a certified copy (which is what Obama got and released), a letter on state letterhead saying "yes, that information exists" if you ask them whether a specific piece of information regarding a birth exists, or you can go in and look at the records yourself (but not get a copy).

The "long form" is not issued any more. Ever. Under any circumstances. No matter who gives their permission. Period.
 
 
Even if you're in the press, and have a nice cinnamon roll?
 
 
I love birthers. They simply cannot get over the fact that their president is a black man. Since the election wasn't close enough to call 'FIX', they try to rationalize it by declaring President Obama ineligible after the fact. This messes with their heads so much that they go deaf, dumb and blind when presented with any evidence that shows that their claim is completely irrational and bogus.

Well, to be fair. It could be an irrational hatred of Democrats rather than an irrational hatred of blacks.
 
 
 
My understanding is that he has issued a copy of his certificate of live birth which is not the same as his actual birth certificate, and that there are serious questions concerning the legitimacy of even that document. I also understand that some deliberately refuse to consider and acknowledge that distinction, for whatever their own reasons.

.

 
I am sure I repeating other people here (haven't read through the whole thread yet), but this is exactly wrong. What Obama released -- his Certificate of Live Birth -- is the ONLY record that the state of Hawaii releases. It is, for all intents and more importantly legal purposes, his birth certificate. There is NO OTHER DOCUMENT. All states and the federal government recognize it as such.

The fact that you don't is, well, stupid. It means that you would not recognize anyone who was born in Hawaii as being really born in Hawaii because they haven't produced some some sort of mythical, non existant birth certificate.

I was born in Michigan. I do not have the "certificate" that was issues in 1958 by the Hospital or the County (something that I'm sure is true for many Americans). The County and State both have issued me a Certificate of Life Birth for the purposes of getting a passport, security clearnances, etc. The Document is verification and "proof" by the County and State that I was born in Michigan.

What part of this process don't you understand? Perhaps you should see a nuerologist.
 
 
 
Well, to be fair. It could be an irrational hatred of Democrats rather than an irrational hatred of blacks.

 
I think it's more like an irrational hatred of Democrats compounded by an irrational hatred of blacks.
 
 
 
The obvious JREF consensus thus far seems to clearly be that the press should not ask Obama directly concerning his birth.

Would any of you likewise find it inappropriate and unacceptable for a investigative journalist among the press to ask Nancy Pelosi about the DNC Official Certification of Nomination of Barack Obama for President of the United States of America that she signed?

Would that be a fair expectation within the role of the press?

 
Typically, you've mischarachterized the response. It isn't that the press "shouldn't ask" (which in your strange mind implies some sort of conspiracy of silence abetting a fraud), it is that it is a meaningless question, asked already and answered and thus a waste of time.

Why? Because a minimal amount of digging...beyond revealing tons of fake documents produced by people who believe what you believe...finds the only recognized, legitimate documents to be in place, existent and showing that Obama was born where he says he was, when he was.

You suggest that it "possible" for Obama to be born in Kenya. You come to this conclusion by looking at material created by people who have repeatedly shown their willingness to forward fake documentation as "real"...fakes that are easilly shown to be fakes...but, you take them at face value. On the other hand, official state documents and items like newspapers that couldn't have been faked at the time, show that Obama's history is consistent and indipendently verifiable by legally recognized documentation.

And, yet, we're supposed to take your questions seriously?
 
 
 
I would look into it further before confidently accepting this dismissal as conclusive, but if it is in fact false, I have absolutely no objection to its rejection. None whatsoever. I have no objections to the truth, whatever it may be.

 
You've already shown this to be if not a lie, a delusional misrepresentation.
 
 
 
I think it's more like an irrational hatred of Democrats compounded by an irrational hatred of blacks.

 
Yes, I see I posed a false dichotomy, but my underlying point still stands. I believe the number of non-racist birthers to be greater than zero.

"

 
The long-form is no longer available. While it is possible that his mother once had a long-form copy, it is easy to believe that it was lost after moving several times. Even if President Obama says "dear Hawaii, release my long form certificate to the press," Hawaii will not. The state no longer issues long forms.

Oh, and before I forget, I wanted to ask you: Why did Hillary Clinton, the most ruthless and treacherous woman in the history of U.S. politics, accept his birth certificate? Why did John McCain accept President Obama's birth certificate?
 
 
Since JudeBrando has ignored the fact that Obama WAS asked directly and continues to bring up talking points instead of directly responding to questions asked, it is difficult not to presume that his only purpose here is to continue to generate buzz about the issue without actually trying to resolve any of the questions.

^^This.

I currently possess two copies of my birth certificate. Now, I wasn't born in Hawaii, but my point will still stand; the original has the words "Certificate of Live Birth" on it, while the copy I requested when I thought I had lost my original does not; in fact, it has no words indicating "birth certificate" at all. I have used the copy to provide proof that I was born in the United States for the purposes of receiving a fairly high-level security clearance. By Jude's logic, I have apparently received my current security clearance through fraudulent means, despite the fact that the copy was issued from the Ohio Department of Vital Statistics and is notarized as a legitimate certification that I was born there.

Someone may want to inform the Office of Personnel Management.

Well, let's cut to the chase: Where you born in America? If so, why?
 
 
 
Yes, I see I posed a false dichotomy, but my underlying point still stands. I believe the number of non-racist birthers to be greater than zero.

 
As far as I can see, for one to be a birther, at least one of the following must apply:

1. A shocking level of ignorance.
2. Bitterness at the 2008 campaign results, and a desire to see Obama removed from office by any illegitimate reason whatsoever. (i.e., grasping at straws)
3. Some degree of racism, which may be something as mild as, "Well he's not white, so he must be foreign."
 
 
I have no knowledge, but based on my ignorance, I believe that Obama is more, purer an American than Jude. My ignorance tells me that Jude is trying to tear this great country down and probably as a result of some sort of anti-American snetiment he learned at the knee of his obviously Nazi-collaborationist Grandfather. I can't prove it, but it is my right to ask the question.
 
 
 
...the Democrat Party...

 
Please clarify. Are you referring to the party in  Thailand ,  Turkey ,  Indonesia ,  Azerbaijan , or 1930's  New Zealand  ?

And what does this have to do with the topic at hand?
 
 
 
Well, let's cut to the chase: Where you born in America? If so, why?

 
Better; I was born in the United States!  
 
 
To steal an old internet meme: Why hasn't JudeBrando addressed the accusation that he raped and murdered a girl in 1990?
 
 
 
Regardless of your position on the issue, since it is a lingering, nagging and persistent question, at least with some,

why has no one in the press ever just directly asked President Obama concerning the matter?

Do you think any journalists should or should not do so and why or why not?

 
This is an excellent question!
I suggest you start a thread on this topic, entitled "The Role of The Press and the birth certificate"
In fact, I am wondering why you haven't done so already, and when, if ever, you are going to start such a thread, and what do you fear to loose if you would start a thread entitled thusly?
 
 
 
Well, to be fair. It could be an irrational hatred of Democrats rather than an irrational hatred of blacks.

 
Unlikely. If Obama is gone, he will be succeeded by Biden, who is also a Democrat.

Indeed, I think JudeBrando really needs to address the lingering, nagging and persistent question of why he hasn't started a thread on this topic, entitled "The Role of The Press and the birth certificate".

In fact, why hasn't he done so already, if he has nothing to hide?
 
 
 
Unlikely. If Obama is gone, he will be succeeded by Biden, who is also a Democrat.

 
and who has also not countered the mounting, troubling evidence that he was born in Kenya. No one has asked him, specifically I note, whether or not he was born in Kenya. So he has never really adressed the question. Suspicious isn't it? A failure of the press, too, I might add.

But, worse yet, what does it say about America that it elected two men who were both born in Kenya and whose Grandfathers were leaders of the Mau Mau movement?
 
 
Most "investigative journalists" find evidence before asking a pointed question. Finding objective evidence that contradicts the POTUS being born in the USA would include records showing his mother left the USA prior to his birth.

In other words: an investigative journalist investigates.
 
 
 
JudeBrando, why have you not yet started a thread titled "The Role of The Press and the birth certificate"? Hmm? Why?

When you figure out what's wrong with my question above, you'll have figured out what's wrong with yours.

 
 
 
 
 
Unlikely. If Obama is gone, he will be succeeded by Biden, who is also a Democrat.

 
Again, I cannot believe the number of birthers who would say that John McCain is the rightful heir to the crown is zero.
 
 
If John McCain were heir to the crown, that would make him a reptillian member of the NWO. Cheez, can't you keep your NWO conspiracies straight?
 
 
Hm. There appears to be some persistant, lingering questions about whether or not JudeBrando has created a thread titled "The Role of The Press and the birth certificate". This seems like an easy thing to determine and yet, the question remains.

(Do you understand the point of this analogy, JudeBrando, or are we just beating a dead horse here?)
 
 
I don't understand why you're even asking him about starting a thread when the question of his birth certificate remains. Why won't you release your birth certificate, Jude? What are you trying to hide?
 
 
 
Regardless of your position on the issue, since it is a lingering, nagging and persistent question, at least with some,

why has no one in the press ever just directly asked President Obama concerning the matter?

Do you think any journalists should or should not do so and why or why not?

 
Of course someone should ask him, I'd ask the following questions...

1. Where were you born?
2. What hospital were you born in?
3. Was a birth certificate created and signed at the hospital?
3. Is this birth certificate, or a photocopy, still in existence?
5. Why have you not authorized HI to reveal this original birth certificate?

This is nothing more than plain common sense, the fact that it has not been done tell you that the press that has access to the President is a controlled press. It also tells you something about Obama's character/role that he has not volunteered this information.

You pose those as if they are somehow novel questions or meaningful questions.

he has said he was born in Hawaii.
he has identified the hospital.
he has provided the only legal document that Hawaii issues testifying to his birth in that state. And, as pointed out above, he can not "authorize" Hawaii to release an "original" birth certificate.

But the worst lie you tell is "the fact that it hasn't been done..." it has been done repeatedly and investigated repeatedly.

Now, interestingly enough, for all of your and Jude's supposed skepticism, the only docments in this whole affair are the obviously manufactured documents used to try to prove Obama wasn't born in the United States. There's been no showing that any U.S. documents, or newspapers, etc. have been doctored or fake. The only fake ones exist on the other side.

Tells you something, I think, about both the quality of the skepticsm, the skeptics and their argument.
 
 
 
Of course someone should ask him, I'd ask the following questions...

1. Where were you born?
2. What hospital were you born in?
3. Was a birth certificate created and signed at the hospital?
3. Is this birth certificate, or a photocopy, still in existence?
5. Why have you not authorized HI to reveal this original birth certificate?

This is nothing more than plain common sense, the fact that it has not been done tell you that the press that has access to the President is a controlled press. It also tells you something about Obama's character/role that he has not volunteered this information.

 
Why do you think Obama should even be asked those questions, much less have to answer them? The answer to every single one of those questions is already known, and has been for a long time now.

To wit:

1. Honolulu, Hawaii, just like it says on the state-certified and state-verified birth certificate that Obama has released (and as contemporary Honolulu newspaper announcements said).

2. Kapi'olani Medical Center for Women & Children in Honolulu.

3. Conveniently, the two separate questions that you labeled with this number both have the same answer: yes, there was an original form, and yes, either it or a copy of it still exists on file with the Hawaii Department of Health, as verified by the head of that department.

5. Under Hawaiian law, Obama cannot authorize the release of that copy. Hawaii only issues copies of the form he's already released, and no other form.
 
 
 
And so another birther outs himself.

 

And he is a big Glenn Beck fan,as he has shown in other threads. Big Surprise.
 
 
 
3. Conveniently, the two separate questions that you labeled with this number both have the same answer: yes, there was an original form, and yes, either it or a copy of it still exists on file with the Hawaii Department of Health, as verified by the head of that department.

 
Which brings up the underlying question. If someone had control of the CIA, the Federal Bureau of Engraving, all the resources available to the U.S. Marshall's witness protection program, the governor of Hawaii (who already publicly supported the U.S. citizen claim) and the head of the Hawaii Department of Health (who also already publicly supported the U.S. citizen claim), then wouldn't it be absurdly easily to fabricate a long form birth certificate and place it in the records?

Obama has been asked directly? I missed it. Link?

 
Politifact.com - They asked Obama directly as well as his campaign offices about the issues surrounding the rumors that his middle name was Mohammad. His office sent a copy of his COLB to politifact and Fightthesmears.com was opened to answer this question (where he posted his COLB)

 http://forums.randi.org/showthread.php?t=155786 
 
 
Jude:

I’ve written this a couple of times before in other threads, here it goes to you: you say it is possible that Obama was born overseas. Please explain to me, and show me evidence how you think this was done. Specifically tell me how which parts of the scenario makes sense and which if any you can show to be real:

Mama Obama, pregnant, travels from Hawaii to Kenyan in 1961. Her husband is a student living in America on a student visa. She is not from a wealthy family. How did they get there? Did they fly? Do you know what the cost of air travel of this length and time was in 1961? Where did they get the money? How did they go?

Did they fly Hawaii to LA, LA to NY, NY to London, London to Kenya? Did they fly Hawaii to Japan, Japan to Hong Kong, Hong Kong to India, India to Kenya? Can you or any birther support the proposition with timetables, flight schedules, costs and payment possibilities?

Did they travel by boat for one or more legs of the journey? How long did it take (remember we’re dealing with a pregnant woman here)? Can you support the proposition with boat schedules and information about the cost, length of time, ports of call, etc.?

Did she have an American passport? Did he have a Kenyan Passport? Did she have to get a visa to go to Kenya through the British Consulate? Which British Consulate? Why is there no record of her being issued a visa to travel to British terriory?

Assuming she travels to Kenya, to meet his family (?), and to have the baby there? Can’t provide proof to this, but answer me why she would want to have the baby in Kenya, away from her mother and the supposed blessings of a developed world hospital for a hospital in a underdeveloped third world country that had just essentially wrapped up a long insurrection and was about to split off from Britain?

So, a white woman carrying a half white baby travels to a heavily segregated and unintergrated country ruled by white people who look down on race-mixing, and has the baby…but not in the country were her husband is really from but instead, crosses yet another border and has the baby in a different British territory than the one her husband is from…because Mombasa (alleged place of birth) was not part of Kenya in 1960/61.

Additionally, no one at the hospital is stating that they remember what must surely have been a very singular event: a teenage American woman married to a Kenyan who crossed the border to go to hospital in Mombasa to have a mixed race baby in a country where we can pretty much assume that most mixed race children would have been mothered by black natives (not white women).

Next, she has to get the baby back. Even in 1960, you just don’t get on a plane and fly to England or the United States with a baby without documentation.

Did she put the baby on her passport? If she did, than she had to visit an American counsel somewhere in Kenya or Mombasa (if there was one in Mombasa or Kenya) to register the child, and if he was registered there as the son of an American citizen and put on a US passport, at least arguably, he was recognized as a citizen from birth…thus eliminating all of the citizenship gobbledygook even if you could show he was born overseas. And, BTW, there is no record of her putting him on her passport, registering a baby in Kenya or Mombasa, or anyone remembering the strange sight of a teenage mother from Hawaii trying to register her mixed race baby in Kenya or Mombasa.

BTW, the whole mixed race thing is no small matter. It would have stuck out like a sore thumb. People would have remembered a mixed race baby and a white teenage mother traveling by airplane (an expensive and rather limited travel option in the 1960 early 1960s), especially as Kenya and the United States were very segregated societies.

But, getting back to the matter at hand, did Obama senior put him on his passport? If he was on Obama Sr.’s passport how did Obama Senior get him back in with no one noting it either in the British Foreign Office of the agency that issues passports, or at the U.S. boarder? Did he have to renew his Student Visa to re-enter the U.S.? No one in New York or Hawaii thought to note the strange sight of a black African student traveling with his white teenage wife and re-entering the U.S. with the baby on one or the other’s passport?

BTW, she apparently went to Kenya without a Camera and no one in his Family either had a camera or thought to take pictures of mom and newest member of the family at the hospital in Mombasa or in the village in Kenya…. It isn’t like photography (unlike air travel) was out of reach.. So, you think she went all the way to Kenya to have her baby, took no pictures, sent no post cards to friends or family, brought back no native arts and crafts…just a mixed race baby that she brought into the United States at a time when such things were practically unheard of?

Now, she gets back to Hawaii, I’m assuming, slaps herself on the head and says “doh” I had the baby in Kenya, not sure he’s a citizen, not sure I’m a citizen anymore…better what? Consult a lawyer about making sure baby is a citizen or gets citizenship (no record of this), or better still, fake a newspaper announcement that suggest that the baby was born in Hawaii, because once its in the newspaper, no one will ever check and ask for an official record. Also, pretty lucky on her part and Obama’s don’t you think that Hawaii changed its record keeping practices in the 70s, so that the real record of his birth was fortuitously put on microfiche, the paper destroyed, and this bogus CLB became the legal standard for the state verifying a baby’s birth.

SO anyway, these are just some of the problems with your theory, as opposed to the plain and simple fact that Obama has a completely legal, state verified birth certificate attesting to his birth in Hawaii.

Now, what is wrong with my alternative scenario? Why does this work for you?
 
 
 
And so another birther outs himself.

 
It was obvious.
 
 
@headscratcher4=

If he answers, which he probably won't, he'll say he has no idea what actually happened and that this is what America needs to find out.
 
 
Indeed, my point, overmade as usual, is that it takes too many complicated events and circumstances to sustain the belief...when what is provable and fact disposes of the outstanding issues nicely (and verifiably...unlike all that I've written). Yes, he will say: I don't care how it was done, I just know it was done....
 
 
 
Obama has been asked directly? I missed it. Link?

 

 
Brian Williams did not ask Obama where he was born.

 

 
That is a lie.

5. Under Hawaiian law, Obama cannot authorize the release of that copy. Hawaii only issues copies of the form he's already released, and no other form.

 
There are two reasons he should answer the questions, so that we will know his answers, and to put an end to the questioning. There is going to be hell to pay in the next election, and the US citizenry will be paying, if he does not answer these questions forthrightly.

As for 1, 2, and 3, I'm with you.

I don't think you're right about 4, that he cannot authorize the release of his original BC, it defies common sense, and I've never seen it claimed before, not that I've paid much attention to the issue. So I guess I'll believe you are wrong until I see some verification.

Exactly. This - along with the implication that if a journalist would just ask Obama ( again, as it turns out, despite the OP's failure to acknowledge this) where he was born, he would be forced to blow the whistle on himself - makes "birtherism" the stupidest conspiracy ever.

The ony question is which is stupider: birthers who actually expect us to believe they'd accept a "long form" or another verbal statement confirming the President's place of birth in Hawaii, or birthers who would actually believe it themselves.

Either way, it's a big ol' heapin' helpin' o' stupid. With a fail garnish.

 Here  is the current Hawaiian state law governing the release of any birth documentation information.

Pay close attention to the opening section, where it says that no information can be released, save for what's authorized by the rest of the law.

Note how what's authorized falls into three main categories: 1) a certified copy of the birth record or the ability to go into the vault and view (but not get a copy of) that original record, which can be granted only to a limited subset of people. 2) Index and research data extracted from the original records but which isn't a complete accounting of what's on any individual record (save for records older than 75 years being used for a specific genealogical purpose). 3) A letter of verification saying that yes, the Hawai'i DOH has a birth record containing specifically-asked-about information on file (that is, they won't tell you anything you don't already know, merely confirm what you do already know). This also can only be given to a limited subset of people.

Nothing else can be released. To anyone. Ever. PERIOD.

Now note that the "long form birth certificate" does not fall into any of those three categories above. Even those with a "tangible interest" can only look at the original (but not get a copy), get a certified copy (which is actually what Obama obtained and released to the public), or get a letter saying certain information is on file.
 
 
I'm waiting for someone to offer a plausible explanation as to why, if President Obama was truly not born in the U.S., the Republican Party has never formally and legally challenged his ability to take the office. This is the party after all that had no trouble going to court in order to protect its interests back in 2000 over the contested election results in Florida. Why is it suddenly now so reticent to fight?

Regardless of your position on the issue, since it is a lingering, nagging and persistent question, at least with some,

why has no one in the press ever just directly asked President Obama concerning the matter?

Do you think any journalists should or should not do so and why or why not?

 
Because they would look like a retard if they did so as it is such an ridiculous conspiracy theory now.

I wanted to use that word but thought it would be in bad taste. It pretty much is the most accurate description.
 
 
Let's play a fun game of JudeBrando Logical Fallacy Bingo! Please note that several of these occur throughout the thread, but I'm shortening this post by omitting them (and portions of long blocks of copy/pasted and bolded text).

First ball drawn from the tumbler is... appeal to incredulity!

 
Obama has been asked directly? I missed it. Link?

 
Next up, we have... poisoning the well! I'm leaving this one in its "long form" for entertainment value.

 
Are you a Democrat/Obama voter/Obama supporter?

Next (and throughout the thread), JAQing off is called!

 
I simply would like to know the truth of the matter. That is my "agenda."

 
From the same post, we have a hasty generalization! I may have categorized this one wrong, but I'm sure there is a name for this type of argument.

 
Those that disagree are personally disparaged and their arguments are always vilified. It is the Standard Operating Procedure.

 
The next ball pulled is hard to get out of the tumbler, due to being a strawman!

 
Of course, only an idiot birther wingnutbag whackjob racist radical extremist. I know. Of course.

 
Someone should be getting close by now... self-victimization!

 
Of course. Like I said.
I am ignoring nothing. That I do not accept what you swallow does not mean I ignore. It means we differ. It means we have arrived at different conclusions. For whatever your reason, you refuse to allow that of me. You apparently allow for no other legitimate opinion than your own. Leftists never do.

 
Not technically a logical fallacy (consider it a free space), but citing evidence that doesn't exist! It should be noted that the Arabic below "birthplace of Barack Obama" doesn't even come close to phonetically spelling "Barack Obama" or anything similar, but that doesn't deter our hearty JudeBrando!

 
Is this evidence? I don't know... but you do.

 
And finally, we have appeals to authority!

There is no mention of' 'birth records' or 'birth certificates' in the link you gave, so I'll have to withhold judgment on this one.

That said, the idea that the state has a document, in this case a long form birth certificate, that cannot be copied by any person is on its face absurd, so I don't believe it. (Oops, yes I do, results of some investigations cannot be copied, I've had that experience myself, i.e., tried to obtain a copy of an investigation of myself ! and been denied, I was able to see the results). Of course, sometimes absurd things are true, so I'll have to wait a see, maybe even do a bit of googling !

Just out of curiosity, who was the doctor who performed the delivery? My guess is that the answer is not known.
 
 
And I see that JudeBrando is once again ignoring all evidence presented against his point of view,his SOP in other threads. It's just the way he rolls.
 
 
 
Why has the press not asked Obama about not putting $1 Billion into Bigfoot research? What is Obama hiding?

More importantly, why has he spent millions on lawyers to PREVENT research into Bigfoot!

Or you could go to the  Hawaii Department of Health's own website , where they state explicitly that birth certificates are covered under HRS §338-18, the law I linked to. And even more explicitly notes that they're covered under section b, the part of that law that says you can either go in and look at the original record, or get a certified copy (the form Obama released). And that's it.

 
Just out of curiosity, who was the doctor who performed the delivery? My guess is that the answer is not known.

 
 You'd be wrong . It was  Dr. Rodney T. West , an obstetrician who spent virtually his entire life and career in Hawaii, and was in the Navy during World War II (he was actually at Pearl Harbor when the Japanese attacked, and used his medical skills to aid the wounded in the aftermath).

EDIT: Found a better bio of the good doctor (from the website for a book he wrote about the attacks), one that confirms he delivered babies at the Kapi`olani Maternity Hospital.
 
 
What should the press be saying, if anything, about Obama's birth certificate is a conspiracy theory?

Should the Professional Questioners question Obama directly with the question a great many of the public have of Obama - is a conspiracy theory?

Interesting...

Of course it's not.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Jude, have you read  this link?  (It's been posted twice already)

If so, do you find the evidence presented therein to be insufficient? Why?

 
Yes, I looked at it. So what then? Perhaps you accept "factcheck.org", and Snopes, as Gospel truth and think those people are beyond bias but I do not. Many others, as you could also find, do not. They may be right. They may be wrong. I see no blatant problems with what they say. I do not dismiss what they say. I do not know. Point/counterpoint. Prosecution/defense. One side/the other side. I do not know. I would like to know. I am not prejudiced. I see valuable points of contention from both sides. I'd like to see resolution of that contention. It appears that all of you here do not. I'm not surprised at all.

 
Jude, you have been accused, on multiple threads covering multiple subjects, of repeatedly ignoring the evidence that you have asked for. When you ignore very simple posts like the quoted one above, it's no wonder.

 
Yes, Leftists ALWAYS accuse. I don't ignore no matter how many times some of you insist as much. I disagree. Comprende yet?
 
 
 
By Jude's logic, I have apparently received my current security clearance through fraudulent means, despite the fact that the copy was issued from the Ohio Department of Vital Statistics and is notarized as a legitimate certification that I was born there.

Someone may want to inform the Office of Personnel Management.  

 
Nonsense. You, like me, are nobody. Barack Obama is President of the United States of America. There are significant differences in possibilities and in reasons. Think about it. Or not. Probably not...

 
Which legitimate questions have they raised? I've never seen one.

 
And I suspect and fully expect that you never would see any.
 
 
 
Yes, I looked at it. So what then? Perhaps you accept "factcheck.org", and Snopes, as Gospel truth and think those people are beyond bias but I do not. Many others, as you could also find, do not. They may be right. They may be wrong. I see no blatant problems with what they say. I do not dismiss what they say. I do not know. Point/counterpoint. Prosecution/defense. One side/the other side. I do not know. I would like to know. I am not prejudiced. I see valuable points of contention from both sides. I'd like to see resolution of that contention. It appears that all of you here do not. I'm not surprised at all.

 
So, the words of respected factchecking organizations and officials (and documents) of the state of Hawaii hold the same evidential value to you as the words of random bloggers and crackpots?

That's...telling.
 
 
 
At this point, I don't care if he was born here or not. If the Republican party was so incompetent, so amateurish, so bush-league, so inept as to not get this resolved before 2011, then they don't deserve the presidency. If "an effete corps of impudent snobs who characterize themselves as intellectuals" can put an impostor in the White House, then I say more power to them.

 
I salute your honesty. Most of your comrades lack your courage.

"Though we live in an era when all undesirable facts are often blindly labeled “conspiracy theories” by political operatives with an agenda at risk, a very real conspiracy unfolds every now and then. A political national committee, the Chair of the Party convention, the Secretary of the Party, Party offices in each of fifty states, and maybe many – many more, have knowingly and wantonly defrauded the American election system and more than 300 million American citizens. They plotted and planned an act of evil, unlawful, treacherous fraud in a blind quest for unbridled political power, and they hoped that you would never catch it. They almost got away with it too… They snuck it past fifty state election commissions, congress, the US Supreme Court and Justice Department, the Federal Elections Commission and countless members of the Electoral College nationwide. Not a single member of the, as Limbaugh says, “drive-by media” caught it either, or if they did, they decided to become complicit for their own political reasons."

"Are you still wondering why Barack Obama has spent nearly $1.5 million in taxpayer’s funds to race Department of Justice lawyers around the country to stop all cases questioning Obama’s eligibility before discovery can force Obama to open up his top secret life? Now I realize that leftists, I mean liberals, no “progressives” – don’t like getting all bogged down in minutia and nit-picky details like the Constitution, but this is actually very serious business here. We are talking about the top-down leadership of the ruling political Party knowingly and wantonly defrauding voters by way of playing monkey business with fraudulent election documents."

Dr. Charles E. Rice
Professor Emeritus of Law
University of Notre Dame

His areas of specialization are constitutional law and jurisprudence. He currently teaches Law and Morality at Notre Dame.

"The courts are not the only entities empowered to deal with such a question. A committee of the House of Representatives could be authorized to conduct an investigation into the eligibility issue."

"... It is difficult to imagine, to borrow Wilson''s phrase, a more pressing "affair of government" than the question of whether a sitting president obtained his office illegally, and perhaps even by fraud. "

"... An investigation into Obama's eligibility by a committee or subcommittee of the House could have several legitimate objectives, including among others:

1. To ascertain the facts, compelling by subpoena the production of all the available records relevant to Obama's eligibility, including the complete Hawaiian records of his birth; his passport records to ascertain whether he traveled to Pakistan in 1981 on an American or other passport; the records from Occidental College, Columbia University and Harvard Law School to determine whether Obama described himself as a foreign student; and such other records as may be relevant. The disclosure of such information to the public would be an appropriate exercise of Congress'' "informing function."

2. The consideration of legislation to require candidates for a federal elective office to produce, at an appropriate time, evidence of their eligibility for that office. There is now no federal law or regulation that requires such disclosure.

3. The consideration of legislation to define the constitutional term, "a natural born Citizen. "

"The American people do not know whether the current president achieved election by misrepresenting, innocently or by fraud, his eligibility for that office. I neither know nor suggest the answer to that question. But it would be a public service for the House of Representatives to employ its authority to determine those facts and to recommend any indicated changes in the law or the Constitution."
 
 
 
If what he ^ says is true

 
As has been shown in this thread (among many others here at JREF), it's not.

What that guy says and the truth aren't even on each others' Christmas card lists.
 
 
*********** liar.

 
 
Obama has been asked directly? I missed it. Link?

 

 
Brian Williams did not ask Obama where he was born.

 

 
That is a lie.

The first lines of the linked interview are :

Interviewer : "Mr President, you are an American born Christian?"
Obama : "Uh huh." <nods>

Question asked, question answered.

 
I couldn't play the video on TPM. Here it is on youtube.

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4MQbKN9cSw 

 
 
 
 
"The American people do not know whether the current president achieved election by misrepresenting, innocently or by fraud, his eligibility for that office. I neither know nor suggest the answer to that question. But it would be a public service for the House of Representatives to employ its authority to determine those facts and to recommend any indicated changes in the law or the Constitution."

 
Why should Obama be subject to this, when no other President (or even Presidential candidate) has ever been subject to this? Especially when Obama has already provided more verified and documented evidence for his birth than any other President (or even Presidential candidate) has ever provided?
 
 
 
I love birthers. They simply cannot get over the fact that their president is a black man. Since the election wasn't close enough to call 'FIX', they try to rationalize it by declaring President Obama ineligible after the fact. This messes with their heads so much that they go deaf, dumb and blind when presented with any evidence that shows that their claim is completely irrational and bogus.

 

 
Well, to be fair. It could be an irrational hatred of Democrats rather than an irrational hatred of blacks.

 
Of course, it is simply impossible that any of them legitimately and honestly care. Of course not. They are simply rotten people... and therefore, their concerns are dismissed... Standard Operating Procedure.

 
I think it's more like an irrational hatred of Democrats compounded by an irrational hatred of blacks.

 
Oh yes of course! That must be it.

 
Yes, I see I posed a false dichotomy, but my underlying point still stands. I believe the number of non-racist birthers to be greater than zero.

 
Of course, but many like Spindrift simply cannot allow for any simple human decency in any of their political opponents.
 
 
 
Of course, it is simply impossible that any of them legitimately and honestly care. Of course not. They are simply rotten people... and therefore, their concerns are dismissed... Standard Operating Procedure.

 
Now that your original post has been shown to be a clear, blatant lie, are you seriously going to try this ******** strawman thing? Are you that transparent? Really?
 
 
 
Point/counterpoint. Prosecution/defense. One side/the other side. I do not know. I would like to know. I am not prejudiced. I see valuable points of contention from both sides. I'd like to see resolution of that contention. It appears that all of you here do not.

 

No, you do not. There are NO valuable points from your side.

Birthers are as bewildering in their beliefs as 9/11 truthers. This whole birther thing came from rumor and falsely created documents on the internet. Despite explanations to the contrary and the conspiracy believers inability to appreciate the sheer numbers of people keeping their lips zipped, from the media to personnel in the department where those records are kept, there are certain die-hards who will never give up the struggle easily like the Japanese straggler Hiroo Onoda.

For the record, I am not a Democrat and have never voted for a Democrat in my life at either the local or national level. The only Republicans I have ever voted for President was Nixon in 68 and McCain 40 years later, a vote cast only AGAINST Obama.

I am definitely NOT a leftist.

Anybody who still believes any of this claptrap about Obama or even believes that those pix of Marcy Moore is Obama's mother is too far down the rabbithole to see the light, and if you happen to be sitting anywhere on my side of the political spectrum, it must be on the Group W bench.
 
 
 
You suggest that it "possible" for Obama to be born in Kenya. You come to this conclusion by looking at material created by people who have repeatedly shown their willingness to forward fake documentation as "real"...fakes that are easilly shown to be fakes...but, you take them at face value.

 
No, that's not why, if the truth about me matters to you at all, which I entirely doubt at this point. I saw a video, no longer available, of Obama's paternal grandmother saying he was born there. I have no reason to call Obama's black African grandmother a liar. Maybe you are that racist though?
 
 
 
EDIT: Found a better bio of the good doctor (from the website for a book he wrote about the attacks), one that confirms he delivered babies at the Kapi`olani Maternity Hospital.

 
Did Dr. West confirm publicly on the record that he delivered the baby O?
 
 
 
Nonsense. You, like me, are nobody. Barack Obama is President of the United States of America. There are significant differences in possibilities and in reasons. Think about it. Or not. Probably not..

 
You seriously think that receiving a high-level security clearance translates to me being nobody?

I assure you, according to the US Government, I am actually pretty important. They don't hand those things out like candy, you know. Took a while to get, and they had to dig into my background pretty extensively.

Much like they would to, oh say, a PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE.

Occam's razor, my friend. Look it up, learn it. Maybe then you'll see the ludicrousness of your claims.
 
 
 
Did Dr. West confirm publicly on the record that he delivered the baby O?

 
He died before the crackpot "birther" theories even arose, at the venerable age of 98. So he never had the chance.

But, as the linked Buffalo News article shows, a family friend of Dr. West's who also knew the Obama and Dunham families talked about his reaction to Obama's birth, and why it was memorable for him even long, long before Obama became a public figure.
 
 
 
Yes, I looked at it. So what then? Perhaps you accept "factcheck.org", and Snopes, as Gospel truth and think those people are beyond bias but I do not. Many others, as you could also find, do not.

 
No we accept their reporting of FACTS based on their research and the fact that they BACK up their claims.

Factcheck - went to the campaign offices of Obama in Chicago and PHOTOGRAPHED the COLB in person. The fact that you didn't NOTICE this, means that YOU did not look at it.

Snopes - they link to ALL of their findings based on their research. ALL of their articles are footnoted. Which means YOU didn't bother to read what was at snopes either, because YOU could have easily seen where they got their information form

So when you said "I looked at it" - we know that YOU did not look at anything.

 
They may be right. They may be wrong. I see no blatant problems with what they say. I do not dismiss what they say. I do not know.

 
YOU have unequivocally dismissed what they stated.

 
Point/counterpoint. Prosecution/defense. One side/the other side. I do not know. I would like to know. I am not prejudiced. I see valuable points of contention from both sides. I'd like to see resolution of that contention. It appears that all of you here do not. I'm not surprised at all.

 
Crock.

 
Yes, Leftists ALWAYS accuse. I don't ignore no matter how many times some of you insist as much. I disagree. Comprende yet?

 
You haven't comprende anything

.

 
anyone who relies on the lies of Candafreepress have no business telling us who is reporting the truth.

CFP is the equivalent of World Nut Daily in the states.
 
 
 
Except that there is no provision under current Hawaiian law for this. Hawaii isn't refusing to release the "long-form certificate" because Obama hasn't given his permission.

Hawaii is refusing to release the "long-form certificate" because even if Obama tells them to release it, they can't under the laws as they currently stand.

The law says you can get one of three things: a certified copy (which is what Obama got and released), a letter on state letterhead saying "yes, that information exists" if you ask them whether a specific piece of information regarding a birth exists, or you can go in and look at the records yourself (but not get a copy).

The "long form" is not issued any more. Ever. Under any circumstances. No matter who gives their permission. Period.

 

 
The long-form is no longer available. While it is possible that his mother once had a long-form copy, it is easy to believe that it was lost after moving several times. Even if President Obama says "dear Hawaii, release my long form certificate to the press," Hawaii will not. The state no longer issues long forms.

Oh, and before I forget, I wanted to ask you: Why did Hillary Clinton, the most ruthless and treacherous woman in the history of U.S. politics, accept his birth certificate? Why did John McCain accept President Obama's birth certificate?

 
You may be correct. I would have no objection to the truth of the matter. Perhaps one of you would like to contact and challenge Professor Rice? I bet you would get a response. Please post it here.

And why would you say such things about Hillary? Why do you hate strong women? Why are you such a bigoted sexist?

BTW: THe steadydrip blog is a known birther blog. they post lies.

It came from the insane rantings of  Andy Martin . A known racist and anti-semite
 
 
What the press should be saying is that Birtherism is a mental illness.

Every editorial section in the country should be screaming for the involuntary committal of Birthers, and their humane treatment by means of prefrontal lobotomy.
 
 
 
Since JudeBrando has ignored the fact that Obama WAS asked directly and continues to bring up talking points instead of directly responding to questions asked, it is difficult not to presume that his only purpose here is to continue to generate buzz about the issue without actually trying to resolve any of the questions.

The first lines of the linked interview are :

Interviewer : "Mr President, you are an American born Christian?"
Obama : "Uh huh." <nods>

Question asked, question answered.

 
 
 
 
Most "investigative journalists" find evidence before asking a pointed question. Finding objective evidence that contradicts the POTUS being born in the USA would include records showing his mother left the USA prior to his birth.

In other words: an investigative journalist investigates.

 
And those that do are then dismissively condemned as birthers...
 
 
 
Of course someone should ask him, I'd ask the following questions...

1. Where were you born?
2. What hospital were you born in?
3. Was a birth certificate created and signed at the hospital?
3. Is this birth certificate, or a photocopy, still in existence?
5. Why have you not authorized HI to reveal this original birth certificate?

This is nothing more than plain common sense, the fact that it has not been done tell you that the press that has access to the President is a controlled press. It also tells you something about Obama's character/role that he has not volunteered this information.

 
Wow. Look how long it took. How striking is the disparity between simple and obvious common sense and the blatantly ridiculous partisan servitude that dominates thought here.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Useful_idiot 
 
 
 
And those that do are then dismissively condemned as birthers...

 

Wrong. Birthers do not investigate. They rely on hearsay, rumors, fake evidence, opinions that have no basis in law, and racism.

Anyone who continues to ask the same questions that were debunked LONG ago should be condemned as birthers.
 
 
 
Wow. Look how long it took. How striking is the disparity between simple and obvious common sense and the blatantly ridiculous partisan servitude that dominates thought here.

 
wow, have you not been reading the replies to this thread?

Of course not. You skipped over every post that I have made including  linking to a previous thread  that has destroyed every claim you have made.
 
 
JudeBrando... I am fascinated by your ability to look at a mountain of facts and still claim you don't have enough information to draw a conclusion.

Your behavior remains consistent with one who wants to keep a question open rather than settle it, as one with intellectual honesty would.
 
 
 
Rice is known to be anti-gay, anti-abortionist, and a bigoted narcissist.

 
What are you known to be?

 
...SO anyway, these are just some of the problems with your theory...

 
I have advanced no theory. I have doubts and questions.

 
Yes, he will say: I don't care how it was done, I just know it was done....

 
I do not know what was or was not done.

It was nice to see you not repeatedly insult me though.

Oh and also that his 'article' is posted to a known raving, racist lunatic, filled birther site also brings a lot of doubt as to his understanding of the issues.

There are two reasons he should answer the questions, so that we will know his answers, and to put an end to the questioning.

 
A-ha! What madness! Another crazy birther exposed!

 
I'm waiting for someone to offer a plausible explanation as to why, if President Obama was truly not born in the U.S., the Republican Party has never formally and legally challenged his ability to take the office.

 
Because they are an inept and cowardly opposition?
 
 
 
Because they are an inept and cowardly opposition?

 
scapegoating there. typical birther bs tactic.

McCain had his own eligibility issues as well, wouldn't you think that because of his own status, he would also want to confirm Obama's? Oh wait, McCain is on record that he wasn't concerned about Obama's Citizenship status, and voted for the resolution that recognized Hawaii was the place of birth for our 44th President.

Hillary's campaign would have done the same. Oh wait, they had no reason to question Obama's citizenship status.

Inept? Not likely.
Cowardly? Hardly. If anything Hillary would have raked Obama over the coals. There wasn't a single day through the Democratic campaigns where Hillary hadn't targeted Obama for an issue or something.
 
 
 
A-ha! What madness! Another crazy birther exposed!

 
OK, let's cut to the chase. Assuming a Reporter who got recognised at a Press Conference was silly enough to risk his job by re-asking the President the question at this late date, if this was the response, would you pick up your bat and ball and go home?

Next up, we have... poisoning the well! I'm leaving this one in its "long form" for entertainment value.
Next (and throughout the thread), JAQing off is called!
From the same post, we have a hasty generalization! I may have categorized this one wrong, but I'm sure there is a name for this type of argument.
The next ball pulled is hard to get out of the tumbler, due to being a strawman!
Someone should be getting close by now... self-victimization!
Not technically a logical fallacy (consider it a free space), but citing evidence that doesn't exist! It should be noted that the Arabic below "birthplace of Barack Obama" doesn't even come close to phonetically spelling "Barack Obama" or anything similar, but that doesn't deter our hearty JudeBrando!
And finally, we have appeals to authority!
Any winners? The game may not be over yet!

The disclosure of such information to the public would be an appropriate exercise of Congress'' "informing function."

 
I would support discovery compelled by subpoena to ascertain the facts under oath.

Stop lying, liar. See, I can do it too.

Brian Williams said "You are." He did not say "Are you?"

Brian Williams - "Mr President, you are an American born Christian."
Obama - "Uh huh."

The question mark is asserted but is by no means plain. That was hardly a question but much more plainly a statement. Obama's clear, definitive, unmistakable response to that statement? "Uh huh."

Which is precisely why I have repeatedly said that no one has directly asked him "Where were you born?"

That is not a lie.

Stop lying.
 
 
 
No, that's not why, if the truth about me matters to you at all, which I entirely doubt at this point. I saw a video, no longer available, of Obama's paternal grandmother saying he was born there. I have no reason to call Obama's black African grandmother a liar.

 
So you have no reason to call her a liar but you have no problem saying that Democratic party members and leaders in 50 states conspired to violate federal law and the Constitution - a conspiracy of such magnitude and infamy that if it were to become known it would would destroy the Democratic party as we know it and ensure that the Republicans held the House the Senate and the Presidency for 8 to 12 years at least. A conspiracy so vile that its discovery might generate unbridled violence in the streets of D.C.

What's more is that this conspiracy is so tenuously constructed that a well-placed question in the White House press room might bring it all tumbling down, yet so impregnable that the entire Republican Party is powerless against it. The whole thing is laughable.
 
 
Suddenly, Arus808 is not posting incessantly, nor is anyone else. Hmm, wonder why that is? Kind of an unmistakable question on the table right now regarding who is and who is not interested in the truth of the matter, isn't there?

Suddenly, Arus808 is not posting incessantly, nor is anyone else. Hmm, wonder why that is? Kind of an unmistakable question on the table right now regarding who is and who is not interested in the truth of the matter, isn't there?

 
Perhaps other people have lives to lead rather than spending 24 hours a day on the internet refuting nonsense, unlike many Conspiracy Theorists, who do nothing other than live in their mothers Basements, eat takeaway Pizza, and live for the next post they can make which does not usually reflect reality.

So you have no reason to call her a liar but you have no problem saying that Democratic party members and leaders in 50 states conspired to violate federal law and the Constitution - a conspiracy of such magnitude and infamy that if it were to become known it would would destroy the Democratic party as we know it and ensure that the Republicans held the House the Senate and the Presidency for 8 to 12 years at least. A conspiracy so vile that its discovery might generate unbridled violence in the streets of D.C.

What's more is that this conspiracy is so tenuously constructed that a well-placed question in the White House press room might bring it all tumbling down, yet so impregnable that the entire Republican Party is powerless against it. The whole thing is laughable.

 
I am not saying she is or is not a liar. Democratic leadership is, or at least should be, accountable. The rest, most, as always, surely just went along. I am saying I would like answers.

I would like the press to ask Obama. I would like the press to ask Pelosi. They will not do so. I think that is a criminal dereliction of duty. Since they will not do so, even though I do not expect it to happen, I would fully support discovery compelled by subpoena to ascertain the facts under oath by a court or, preferably, in public hearings by the House of Representatives.

Ladewig, would you support or oppose discovery compelled by subpoena to ascertain the facts under oath? If not, why not?

How come you didn't say that to Arus808 or duabadoo or whatever his name is when he repeatedly asked why I hadn't responded to him?

I know, because you are so fair, honest and interested in the truth, whatever it may be, Norm.
 
 
 
There are two reasons he should answer the questions, so that we will know his answers, and to put an end to the questioning.

 

 
A-ha! What madness! Another crazy birther exposed.

 

We already knew that. Welcome to the party.
 
 
 
I know, because you are so fair, honest and interested in the truth, whatever it may be, Norm.

 
Yep and I would like a fair and honest answer to the question I now ask for the third time, and perhaps an answer to a second question:

So, if a reporter said:

Reporter : Mr President, where were you born?
Obama : Hawaii

Would that end it for you?

Why did I have top ask this question three times (so far) before you answered?

Wait. What?
You are saying that the press should be arrested for not asking questions. It is almost like you are not taking the topic seriously and now are just saying things to see how people respond.

 
Since they will not do so, even though I do not expect it to happen, I would fully support discovery compelled by subpoena to ascertain the facts under oath by a court or, preferably, in public hearings by the House of Representatives.

Ladewig, would you support or oppose discovery compelled by subpoena to ascertain the facts under oath? If not, why not?

 
I think the facts have already been ascertained so no special prosecutor or special investigator is necessary. But let's come right down the the critical question. Why does the Republican Party not ask these questions? not launch an investigation? not bring lawsuits? not break down the doors to the Hawaiian Department of Health?
 
 
 
Wait. What?

Of course not. Don't be ridiculous. You are better than that.

As you know, I did not ask if you thought it was necessary, but this is how you avoid answering?

Oppose. Sending prosecutors on wild goose chases is a waste of resources and valuable time. But I am not alone, the Republicans also oppose discovery compelled by subpoena to ascertain the facts under oath.

I oppose such discovery just as I would oppose a Senator who suggested we launch an investigation as to whether or not we went to the moon.
 
 
 
I would support discovery compelled by subpoena to ascertain the facts under oath.

WOULD YOU?

 
I think our congress' non-infinite time could be better spent looking into matters where we DON'T already have the answer.

Dear Arus808 and carlitos,

I would support discovery compelled by subpoena to ascertain the facts under oath.

 Oh wait, it was already done 

 And it failed. 

In fact 8  0 cases have been brought forth  most of them was to try and get access to Obama's birth records. ALL have failed. One lawyer was sanctioned $20,000 for filing frivolous lawsuits.

(Hawaii, btw hasn't issued a "long form" in over 10 years),

I. Have. A. Life.

I noticed however,that you:

1) avoided the fact that Obama has already been asked where he was born

2) That you avoided my post where your claim that OBama's step-grandmother said he was born in Kenya, when she didn't say that at all (I even linked to the transcript as well as the ACTUAL audio of the interview)

Nice that you avoid when you are answered pointedly with FACTS, ignore those facts and go one to repeat the same question over again, when not 1 or 2 posts earlier your question was answered.

huh? We are asking why you are not responding to posts and questions that directly REFUTE your claims. Like the fact that you ignored being shown that Obama was asked where he was born.

We don't care when you answer them, just that WE NOTICED that you have not answered them,and skipped to replies/posts after those questions and replied to them instead.

It had nothing to do with timing of your replies.

You could spend 4 days trying to respond to posts. we dont care. Just that its not surprising that you will not directly respond to any post/reply that shows your argument to be wrong.

it's very telling.

Because you tried to claim he wasn't responding to you simply because he hadn't responded for a while to your most recent post, while you continued to post for pages and pages while ignoring the oft repeated question. Can you not see the difference?

Sounds trollish to me. An opinion further cemented by the common troll technique of deliberately misspelling someone's user name in spite of the fact that it's easily checked.

And that accent......  
 
 
 
Yes, I looked at it. So what then? Perhaps you accept "factcheck.org", and Snopes, as Gospel truth and think those people are beyond bias but I do not.

 
Okay, that is not a sufficient answer.

Even if you completely ignore that both FactCheck and Snopes have built up a long history of accurate and non-biased fact checking, dismissing them because they might be wrong, you don't know could be applied to any evidence no matter how rock-solid it might be. Unless you can say why you don't except FactCheck and/or Shopes evidence, you are essentially admitting that no evidence can ever be enough to convince you that Obama was born in Hawaii.

 
Many others, as you could also find, do not. They may be right. They may be wrong. I see no blatant problems with what they say. I do not dismiss what they say. I do not know. Point/counterpoint. Prosecution/defense. One side/the other side. I do not know. I would like to know. I am not prejudiced. I see valuable points of contention from both sides. I'd like to see resolution of that contention. It appears that all of you here do not. I'm not surprised at all.

 
I call BS on this. You are obviously not impartial on this issue.

Perhaps you could answer your own question from earlier that you found so important:

Are you a Democrat/Obama voter/Obama supporter?
 
 
Just returning to the OP:

 
why has no one in the press ever just directly asked President Obama concerning the matter?

 
"Mr President, you are an American born Christian," while not a question, is a statement which clearly invites President Obama to confirm or deny its veracity. "Uh-huh," though informal, is clearly meant to convey the meaning, "Your statement is correct". Therefore, someone in the press has directly asked President Obama to confirm or deny that he was born in the United States, and he has responded with a confirmation.

Therefore, the thread is predicated on a false assumption, and there is no point discussing the matter any further other than to point out the following facts:

There is no evidence, other than the existence of a JREF thread entitled "The Role of The Press and the birth certificate" which lists Jude Brando as its originator, that Jude Brando has originated a thread on JREF entitled "The Role of The Press and the birth certificate". No certified paper copy has been produced by the JREF to confirm that this thread exists, and in any case the JREF is no more than an internet discussion forum and cannot therefore be an authoritative source from which to conclude that this thread exists. Jude Brando has repeatedly refused to answer whether or not he has started a thread on JREF entitled "The Role of The Press and the birth certificate," nor has he provided the legal authorisation for release of the official long form version of the thread. From this, I can only conclude that this thread does not exist, and cannot therefore continue to post in it.

Dave
 
 
The idiocy in here is so deep I need waders.
 
 
 
And those that do are then dismissively condemned as birthers...

 
Please point to the objective evidence that has been produced to contradict the evidence that the President was born in Hawai'i.

Evidence would include:

Flight records or the passenger manifest from a ship that show his mother left the island state prior to his birth. Since you can't drive or walk to leave Hawai'i there would need to be one of these.

Withdrawls from her or parent's bank account in the amount that would pay for a plane or cruise ticket to Kenya (or anywhere).

Customs/Border/immigration records showing an arrival in Kenya or another foreign country and return to the US with a child.

Proof the President's mother had a passport at the time, since records indicate she didn't have one until 1965.

A birth record from the hospital he was born in, that is not in the USA.

Once you have found any of those and independently confirmed their authenticity using multiple sources you would be correct to confront the President or a White House representative with a question about his birth place.

Read All the President's Men. That is how investigative journalists bring down a President.
 
 
See: there is objective evidence the president was born in the U.S. -- starting with, but not limited to, the CLB issued by the state of Hawaii, but also including contemporaneous newspaper annoucements and personal memories.

But: there is absolutely no objective, unbiased evidence that he was born elsewhere, no passports, passport/visa applications, postcards from far away places, nick-nacks bought on the trip, family photographs, etc.

So, the essential position is: I will dismiss all objective evidence as biased and accept all biased evidence as credibly possible.

Brilliant.
 
 
 
Better; I was born in the United States!  

 
The United States of... Mexico?!?  

 
Snopes - they link to ALL of their findings based on their research. ALL of their articles are footnoted. Which means YOU didn't bother to read what was at snopes either, because YOU could have easily seen where they got their information form

 
That's exactly what Snopes want you to think.
 

Edit:

 
"Mr President, you are an American born Christian," while not a question, is a statement which clearly invites President Obama to confirm or deny its veracity. "Uh-huh," though informal, is clearly meant to convey the meaning, "Your statement is correct".

 
Bear in mind that this was on video, not just a radio interview. The "nods" part makes the answer even more unambiguous.
 
 
 
He died before the crackpot "birther" theories even arose, at the venerable age of 98. So he never had the chance.

But, as the linked Buffalo News article shows, a family friend of Dr. West's who also knew the Obama and Dunham families talked about his reaction to Obama's birth, and why it was memorable for him even long, long before Obama became a public figure.

 
Well, he died in 2008? It's too bad, as if he did deliver O, and publicly verified it, it would.... have probative value. As it stands, though, I'm not so sure.... here is more on the story....

 http://www.examiner.com/city-hall-in...-obama-s-birth 

excerpt...

When confronted with the fact that West could not possibly have delivered Obama since, according to a Hawaiian Pearl Harbor history website, he retired in 1956, five years before Obama's birth, Nelson backtracked a bit: "I don't know in what capacity [West] knew about this particular birth," she said. Later in the interview, Nelson said the assumption that West delivered the baby, or that she said that, were just misunderstandings on the part of the Buffalo News reporter.

So, this is just another example of why Obama should speak forthrightly on the issue, all this looking for clues under 50 year old rocks borders on the absurd.

Maybe you can find something that shows he was born somewhere other than Hawaii, because until then you just sound like a whining twit.

No. The justice system is not to be used to faciliatate the obsessive repetition by idiots of questions that have already been answered to the complete satisfaction of anybody with a shred of objectivity and intelligence. People with no case to present should not be allowed to waste the time of the justice system. A legally valid certificate confirming that Barack Obama was born in the US State of Hawaii in 1961 has been made public, and this should be the end of it.

Would you support testimony under oath? Yes or no?

 
I would love to answer this question as soon as you start a thread titled "The Role of The Press and the birth certificate", which would be a proper venue to discuss these pressing matters. This here is not.

Also I am beginning to think that you are simply ignoring the numerous requests made of you to post start such a thread. Do you hope it will simply go away? Rest assured it will not. If you only started such a thread, or explained why you do not want to start such a thread, all this questioning would stop. Really, its so simple, just click a button. Why don't you?

Later in the interview, Nelson said the assumption that West delivered the baby, or that she said that, were just misunderstandings on the part of the Buffalo News reporter.

 
So, WingNutDaily's exhaustive debunking research consisted of quoting a Pearl Harbor website, and just uncritically accepted all the dates in that?

According to the  Mamiya Medical Heritage Center at the Hawaii Medical Library , Dr. West only became board-certified obstetrician in 1958 (before that, he was in general practice).

That means Dr. West would have retired at the rather young age of 46, and had been retired for two years at the time he became a board-certified obstetrician! That'd be... unusual, to say the least.

And, lo and behold, the Medical Heritage Center reveals the much more sensible information that he was a practicing physician all the way up until his actual retirement in the 1970's, after having reached the common retirement age of his mid-sixties.
 
 
 
The rest, most, as always, surely just went along. I am saying I would like answers.

 
No, you are refusing to accept valid answers because they aren't what you want to hear.

 
Dear Arus808 and carlitos,

I would support discovery compelled by subpoena to ascertain the facts under oath.

WOULD YOU?

 
No, the question has been answered.

There is, however, the troubling and unresolved question of why you haven't started a thread titled "The Role of The Press and the birth certificate."

 
So, the essential position is: I will dismiss all objective evidence as biased and accept all biased evidence as credibly possible.

Brilliant.

 
Exactly.

 
So, this is just another example of why Obama should speak forthrightly on the issue, all this looking for clues under 50 year old rocks borders on the absurd.

 
Posting his birth certificate -- the standard proof provided by the state he was born in -- was forthrightly speaking on the issue. (And even then, it was really sad that it was even necessary.) Continuing to address the question would be giving legitimacy to people who will never believe anything he says anyway.

The people who continue pretending there is something worth questioning are the cause of the absurdity.
 
 
 
And, lo and behold, the Medical Heritage Center reveals the much more sensible information that he was a practicing physician all the way up until his actual retirement in the 1970's, after having reached the common retirement age of his mid-sixties.

 
Well, you know the Medical Heritage Center is probably in on it too.
 
 
 
Would you support testimony under oath? Yes or no?

 
Why, exactly, is this needed?
Only looney toons that can't accept that Obama legitimately got elected keep harping on this.
Besides, by the time any legal action was taken to remove him from office, he'll be out of office. It's too late, dude. Even if he gets re-elected, by the time any challenge got through all the legal whoop-dee-do, President Ah-nold will issue a Presidential Pardon!
 
 
 
Well, you know the Medical Heritage Center is probably in on it too.

 
I'd like to see some proof that the Medical Heritage Center exists.
 
 
 
Stop lying, liar. See, I can do it too.

Brian Williams said "You are." He did not say "Are you?"

Brian Williams - "Mr President, you are an American born Christian."
Obama - "Uh huh."

The question mark is asserted but is by no means plain. That was hardly a question but much more plainly a statement. Obama's clear, definitive, unmistakable response to that statement? "Uh huh."

Which is precisely why I have repeatedly said that no one has directly asked him "Where were you born?"

That is not a lie.

Stop lying.

 
Argument by magical order of words? Are you one of those freemen on the land types?

Oh wait, it doesn't even matter if a reporter asked in the way you said because:

 
So, if a reporter said:

Reporter: Mr President, where were you born?
Obama: Hawaii

Would that end it for you? It's just a "yes" or "no"

 

 
No.

 
JudeBrando could receive live video of Obama's birth with palm trees and pineapples and a King Kamehameha statue in the background, and he'd still have questions about our dear leader. It's either trolling 101 or a racist thing. Either way, there isn't much point engaging other than to point out the obvious lies.
 
 
 
Plus there's a small group of extreme Clinton supporters. That's the triad though.

 
Yeah, I knew one. Thought she was a friend. Then she started posting these horrible racist Obama cartoons on her supposedly "Progressive" blog. I mean these things reminded me of 30s Nazi cartoons. Horrible.

I don't speak to her any more.
 
 
I don't think any questions should be asked under oath. People lie under oath. I think that they should be thrown in the water. If they sink, they're telling the truth. If they float, their witches and should be burned at the stake. Simple, straightforward method of leveraging out the truth.

BTW, if I'm not mistaken (and I may be), when he applied for a passport, didn't Obama have to sign or affirm in a legally binding way that what he was attesting to for the passport...i.e. a CLB verrified by the state of Hawaii...was true to the best of his knowledge. My sense is...and again, I could be wrong...that this is tantamount to affirming under oath and would open himself up to a perjury charge, lying to a federal agent, fraud, and I think other charges.

The passport agency, interestingly enough, accepted the Hawaii Certificate -- as they would be required to do by law -- without any doubt about its veracity. This was well before Obama was running for much of anything.

So, it seems to me that A). you actually have Obama under oath, and B) you have a federal agency charged with verifying such things as where a person was born before issuing a passport, accepting, as it must, that the state "certified" certificate is both legitimately issued by the state and conveys correct information, in this case that the person named on the certificate was born in the state of Hawaii.

There. Problem solved.
 
 
 
See: there is objective evidence the president was born in the U.S. -- starting with, but not limited to, the CLB issued by the state of Hawaii, but also including contemporaneous newspaper annoucements and personal memories.

But: there is absolutely no objective, unbiased evidence that he was born elsewhere, no passports, passport/visa applications, postcards from far away places, nick-nacks bought on the trip, family photographs, etc.

 
Plus, he admitted that what "evidence" caused him to start questioning Obama's birth, was the video of Obama's grandmother. A video which has since been shown, without a doubt, to be a blatant misrepresentation of what actually happened. Berg lied by editing a video to make it appear to say the opposite of what it really said.

Jude, I haven't seen you acknowledge this. Do you acknowledge that this video was a lie?
 
 
 
Because they are an inept and cowardly opposition?

 

Really? That's your explanation? The same party that went to court in 2000 to protect the results from Florida and the election of George W. Bush to the Presidency? The same party that fought that case all the way to the Supreme Court? The same party that spent millions of dollars contesting the 2008 Presidential election? The same party that had campaigning master Karl Rove?

Your explanation would have to improve one thousand-fold in order to make it to pathetic.
 
 
 
Would you support testimony under oath? Yes or no?

 
I already answered this, and again troll, you ignore it:

 
 Oh wait, it was already done 

 And it failed. 

In fact 8  0 cases have been brought forth , most of them was to try and get access to Obama's birth records. ALL have failed. One lawyer was sanctioned $20,000 for filing frivolous lawsuits.

Unless you can say why you don't except FactCheck and/or Shopes evidence, you are essentially admitting that no evidence can ever be enough to convince you that Obama was born in Hawaii.

 
You bring up an interesting point. Here on the CT board, you see a lot of what I like to call light-switch skepticism. You see, it's not entirely fair to say that conspiracy theorists are not skeptical. As Jude has illustrated, when it comes to evidence that Obama was born in Hawaii, he is very skeptical, even overly skeptical. His switch is in the on position. But does this make him a skeptic? Well, that's not entirely accurate, either. Just earlier in the thread, he had posted this:

 
 http://forums.randi.org/imagehosting...f0fe171292.jpg 

 
Well, there you go. That settles it. Obama was born in Kenya. Case closed. This is evidence that points towards the conclusion he likes (Oh, if only Obama weren't actually the president). Time to turn the switch off.

But then it was pointed out that the image was an obvious fake. So he turned his switch back on and then said this:

 
I would look into it further before confidently accepting this dismissal as conclusive, but if it is in fact false, I have absolutely no objection to its rejection. None whatsoever. I have no objections to the truth, whatever it may be.

 
Well we don't really know! It could be anything. You can never be too sure.
 
 
Since we've still got birthers lingering around here, I have the following argument to propose:

1. The evidence for Obama's American birth is insufficient.
2. If evidence for a proposition is insufficient, then less evidence must also be insufficient.
3. If one has less evidence for an American birth than Obama, then that evidence is insufficient. (from 1 and 2)
4. For any given individual, there is less evidence for their American birth than there is for Obama's.
C. There is insufficient evidence that anyone was born in America. (from 3 and 4)

In case it isn't obvious, this argument is used to highlight how the central tenet of birthers must inevitably lead to a very absurd conclusion.

Premise 1 is being accepted for the sake of argument. Birthers must accept that the evidence is there, but that it is either faked, misleading, or there just isn't enough to prove that Obama was born in America.
Premise 3 and the conclusion are logical necessities.
Premise 2 is fairly obvious. After all, how can an unjustified position become more justified with less evidence?

So that leaves us with only one premise we can possibly discuss: #4. If you don't think that premise 4 is true, then by all means, show me any single individual with more evidence for their American birth than Obama. Here's what I will need you to show me:

1. A birth certificate.
2. A newspaper clipping that highlights the birth.
3. Records proving that the mother was present in America at the time of birth.
4. Investigations from multiple fact-checking organizations that have held the documents with their own hands to verify that they exist and are authentic.
5. A press release by at least two officials within the state of birth, verifying that the records are on file.

Good luck.
 
 
 
Darn it, I could've sworn there used to be a goalpost around here somewhere.

 
We have a bingo! No one clear your cards until the winner has been verified.
 
 
How does the person asking the question make the answer more valid?

If some schmuck on the Internet asks you, "What's two plus two," and you answer, "Four," and then some national reporter asks you, "What's two plus two," and you again answer, "Four," how is second answer any more important than the first?
 
 
It is interesting how the birth certificate CT has become a years-long, textbook example of the moving the goalposts fallacy.
 
 
Conversely, how does the reporter asking the question: were you born in the United States? Have any more validity than the Pass Port office asking "where were you born" and requiring submission of a verified, State certified birth certificate as proof?

Is it that reporters are never wrong, where as the State of Hawaii and the US State Department must be assumed to be either wrong or so prone to error that they are untrustworthy?
 
 
 
Is it that reporters are never wrong, where as the State of Hawaii and the US State Department must be assumed to be either wrong or so prone to error that they are untrustworthy?

 
No, of course not! Don't be silly!

Any source of evidence that indicates Obama isn't actually lying about being a US citizen must be assumed to be either wrong or so prone to error that they are untrustworthy.
 
 
 
Oh wait, it doesn't even matter if a reporter asked in the way you said because:

JudeBrando could receive live video of Obama's birth with palm trees and pineapples and a King Kamehameha statue in the background, and he'd still have questions about our dear leader. It's either trolling 101 or a racist thing. Either way, there isn't much point engaging other than to point out the obvious lies.

 
I get the impression that most Birthers who call for the media to question the President are looking for events to follow a fantasy script where they can catch him in a definitive lie, pull back the curtain, and yell "AH-HA! Now all the world can see you for what you are! A _________"
 
 
 
Since we've still got birthers lingering around here, I have the following argument to propose:

1. The evidence for Obama's American birth is insufficient.
2. If evidence for a proposition is insufficient, then less evidence must also be insufficient.
3. If one has less evidence for an American birth than Obama, then that evidence is insufficient. (from 1 and 2)
4. For any given individual, there is less evidence for their American birth than there is for Obama's.
C. There is insufficient evidence that anyone was born in America. (from 3 and 4)

Good luck.

 
Oh darn. I only fulfill the first requirement. Unless a background check by the US government suffices to answer number four... but even then I have less evidence than the President does that I was born in the US.

Guess you got me. I'm really a spambot programmed to scoff at ludicrous conspiracy theories.

(Note for the humor challenged: the above statement was extreme sarcasm.)

The birthers could try arguing that Hawaii isn't legally a US state.  
 
 
Remember people. Once a nutjob decides to believe in a conspiracy theory nothing will ever make him change his mind, it doesn't matter that it's disprove all the time in-front of his eyes. He wants to believe.
 
 
 
The birthers could try arguing that Hawaii isn't legally a US state.  

 
They've already done that (or, rather, that it didn't become a state until after Obama was born, rather than before).

Indeed, the open question here is what Jude would accept as proof, period. He says he wants a reporter to ask the question straight up...though he doesn't accept that that has in fact taken place. He has doubt about all the official paperwork -- the material that is regarded as verified under the law -- and instead choses the interpretation of a crank law professor. He says he's interested in truth, but what truth?

Reproter: Were you born in Hawaii?
Obama: Yes.

Jude: He's lying
of
Jude: what does he really mean by yes?

It is, essentially, metaphysical. All of us burdened down with ordinary everyday proof that is okay as proof for mere mortals don't fully appreciate the metaphyisical nature of Obama. Not only can he not be trusted to answer truthfully in any circumstance, none of the commonly acceptable documents or laws that are used to verify, say, where a person was born is acceptable when it applies to Obama. And why? Because he's president and the whole scam was set up long ago to burry his past and make him president so he could sell our country down the river.

As they said in JFK, we're through the looking glass here, people. We're into how many angles can dance on the head of a pin.

In fact, it is a complete deconstructionist methodology that takes apart every word as it is commonly used and renders them meaningless in the face of the larger meta-message of Obama's alieness.
 
 
 
They've already done that (or, rather, that it didn't become a state until after Obama was born, rather than before).

 
Unfortunately, for birthers, that wouldn't matter. Hawaii was a territory of the US after the overthrow in 1893 (Hawaii became a US Territory in 1897 thanks to President McKinley). So even if Hawaii wasn't a State, the citizens born in Hawaii before statehood would still be considered US Citizens

Guam - territory of the US. My friend was born there, however he is a US Citizen from birth.
 
 
Puerto Rico-US Territory (or principality, I'm not sure which).

I have a dear friend who was born there; he is considered a US Citizen by default, despite spending the first twenty-odd years of his life not speaking a lick of English. He's a decorated member of the US Army now. Even has a security clearance.

Just to add on to Arus' example above.
 
 
 
You bring up an interesting point. Here on the CT board, you see a lot of what I like to call light-switch skepticism. You see, it's not entirely fair to say that conspiracy theorists are not skeptical.

 
Hence the quote in my sig. But I'd not limit it to just conspiracy theorists.

As is John McCain  WP , who was born in the Panama Canal Zone. Also 1964 Republican Presidential candidate AuH2O  WP , who was born in Arizona three years before it became a state.

Don't forget George Romney who was born in Mexico.

Hey, that reminds me, Mitt wants to run for President, but at least one of his parents was born outside of the U.S., why doesn't he fail the natural born citizen test of some of the birthers?

Seriously, why isn't that being raised? Is it because George Romney's parents were U.S. Citizens? Not sure how the logic works here.
 
 
 
Yes but is he a natrual born citizen?

 
My god...if McKinley wasn't born here, then he wasn't really the president, and Hawaii isn't really part of the US....
 
 
 
My god...if McKinley wasn't born here, then he wasn't really the president, and Hawaii isn't really part of the US....

 
I think he was born in Ohio...which is quite a lot like not being born in the US.
 
 
And what about those Bush-family reptilian presidents, who weren't so much born as hatched in the US? I'm fairly sure that isn't natural.
 
 
 
I think he was born in Ohio...which is quite a lot like not being born in the US.

 
Is there a long form birth certificate to prove it?
 
 
Yes, the form of birth is long.

That means Dr. West would have retired at the rather young age of 46, and had been retired for two years at the time he became a board-certified obstetrician! That'd be... unusual, to say the least.

 
LOL. But according to the article it rattled Nelson. Good strategy for shaking the nuts out of the tree?

Also, I note that the controversy did precede West's death... this is from wiki....

"Sarah Obama shed more light on the controversy in a 2007 interview with the Tribune Company."

The wiki article is long with lots of twists and turns. All the more reason O should speak forthrightly on the issue and put an end to all this nonsense.

"The Evidence

In this case, the Democrat Party was responsible for vetting and certifying Barack Hussein Obama as legally eligible to seek the Oval Office. The U.S. Constitution has only three very specific requirements for the job. The proper legal text used on the DNC Party Official Certification of Nomination document reads as follows, and I quote;

THIS IS TO CERTIFY that at the National Convention of the Democrat Party of the United States of America, held in Denver, Colorado on August 25 through 28, 2008, the following were duly nominated as candidates of said Party for President and Vice President of the United States respectively and that the following candidates for President and Vice President of the United States are legally qualified to serve under the provisions of the United States Constitution.

The document is signed by Chair of the DNC Convention and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, DNC Secretary Alice Travis Germond and Colorado Notary of Public Shalifa A. Williamson. It is dated August 28, 2008.

However, this document was never delivered to a single state DNC Office for state certification, and it was therefore, never presented to any state Election Commission as certification of these candidates, although I do have a copy of this notarized document myself.

Instead, a very similar document was delivered to fifty state DNC offices, which those offices certified to each of fifty state Election Commissions, who then date-stamped the document and stuck it in a file cabinet, and proceeded to place these certified candidates on the ballot.

The Official Certification of Nomination that was presented by the DNC in all fifty states for the 2008 Presidential election, in which Barack Hussein Obama became the new President of the United States, was almost identical, and it too was signed by Chair of the DNC Convention and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, DNC Secretary Alice Travis Germond and Notary of Public Shalifa A. Williamson, dated August 28, 2008.

But this version of the document was missing the following text, and I quote;

- and that the following candidates for President and Vice President of the United States are legally qualified to serve under the provisions of the United States Constitution.

 
Not that the certificate of nomination has any importance whatsoever, but it's pretty evident that the document in question has been misquoted. Specifically, it refers to the "National Convention of the Democrat Party" (bolding mine).

Note that the political party that nominated Barack Obama is officially named the Democrat ic Party. Members of said party are called Democrats. It has become popular in recent years among Republicans and conservatives, for reasons that make no sense to me, to drop the "ic" from the name of the party. However, I'm pretty sure that the Democrat ic Party does not refer to itself as the "Democrat Party" in official documents. It's kind of hard to take the claim of an incomplete certification of nomination seriously when the allegedly quoted document has the name of the party incorrectly incomplete. Kind of makes me wonder what else was left out of the alleged quotation.
 
 
 
LOL. But according to the article it rattled Nelson. Good strategy for shaking the nuts out of the tree?

 
I can rattle people too by making up falsehoods to nitpick regarding memoties from half a century ago.

 
Also, I note that the controversy did precede West's death... this is from wiki....

"Sarah Obama shed more light on the controversy in a 2007 interview with the Tribune Company."

 
Nope,  the article cited for that  also preceded the "controversy". In fact, the article takes no issue about where Obama was born at all (hint: it wasn't Kenya), and doesn't mention anyone who doubts that in the least.

 
The wiki article is long with lots of twists and turns. All the more reason O should speak forthrightly on the issue and put an end to all this nonsense.

 
As has been shown, not only has he, but all the available evidence speaks louder than he ever could.
 
 
 
I think he was born in Ohio...which is quite a lot like not being born in the US.

 
 

I was born in Ohio...
 
 
 
 

I was born in Ohio...

 
So was I!

Though I was born at a military base (Wright-Patterson, in Dayton). So maybe that still counts as the US.

As has been shown, not only has he, but all the available evidence speaks louder than he ever could.

 
Let's see, his grade school teacher said that Dr. West delivered the baby O, but recanted on close questioning, there is not a shred of other evidence, and you know for a fact that Dr. West delivered the baby O.

And, Obama says 'the facts are the facts', and "I can't walk around with my birth certificate plastered to my forehead", and you say that he has spoken forthrightly on the issue.

Plus, you construct a fantasy of obstructions, legal and otherwise, to anyone ever seeing what is on the original birth certificate, which makes no difference anyhow because we already know.

I perceive a black/white quality to your thinking where everything is known, even when it isn't, and every doubt or uncertainty not only unwarranted but maliciously motivated.

I guess you are an official 'Randi' skeptic ! Congratulations.
 
 
Birthers are more stupid than 911 CT morons but not as disgusting as holocaust deniars.

Strangely these seems to be a mix here. Lowest of the low.
 
 
 
Let's see, his grade school teacher said that Dr. West delivered the baby O, but recanted on close questioning

 
Since she never said Dr. West delivered the baby (that was a connection made by the Buffalo News reporter who wrote the article, not by Nelson), she didn't actually "recant" anything when the WND liars confronted her with false evidence.

 
there is not a shred of other evidence, and you know for a fact that Dr. West delivered the baby O.

 
Since all the actual evidence points to Dr. West being a board-certified obstetrician in active practice in 1961 who often delivered babies at Kapo'ilani Hospital and was known for personally recording the birth information from every delivery he performed, the fact that he knew so many details of Obama's birth is a pretty strong indication that Dr. West was personally involved in the delivery of the future president in some capacity.

 
And, Obama says 'the facts are the facts', and "I can't walk around with my birth certificate plastered to my forehead", and you say that he has spoken forthrightly on the issue.

 
When directly asked if he was born an American, he said that he was, in addition to releasing his certified birth certificate which confirms that beyond a reasonable doubt.

 
Plus, you construct a fantasy of obstructions, legal and otherwise, to anyone ever seeing what is on the original birth certificate, which makes no difference anyhow because we already know.

 
Fantasy? I quoted and linked to the explicit statements of State of Hawaii government websites that say exactly that.

Fantasy? I quoted and linked to the explicit statements of State of Hawaii government websites that say exactly that.

 
Well, there's the problem -- Saggy has reality and fantasy mixed up.
 
 
 
I would like the press to ask Obama.

 
I think I found another problem with the birther thing.

How could Obama possibly remember his own birth? All he can go by is what his family told him all his life.

Well, and his birth certificate obviously.
 
 
Saggy: the CLB created and verified and certified by the State of Hawaii says he was born in Hawaii. Obama had nothing to do with its creation or the information on it. The State director says the document is what the document says it is, and that the information on the document is correct. The State Director has no affiliation with Obama, and in fact was a republican. You say because Obama says "I can't go around with my birth certificate plastered on my forehead..." that is some sort of evasion.

He can't. He has produced the document. He has stated in no uncertain terms that he was born in Hawaii.

If his document is no good, than there is no such thing as a valid birth certificate from Hawaii and any number of states...including my own Michigan CLB.

It is as simple as that. BTW, the reason that states rely on documents like Certificates of Live Birth for verification, is because memories are untrustworthy especially with time, people die and most of don't remember our own births...I'll assume you do for the purposes of your own certainty, though I suspect you were born overseas. The states certify these docuents explicitly and exactly to stand as proof for what the document says. If you through out the documents, you have no proof whatsoever.

In short, the only way that you get to the document being bad is to show that the entire system employed by the State of Hawaii is bad, corrupt or in error and by asserting that EVERY Hawaiian CBL is not only wrong but a fraud...and you only believe those people whose parents were smart enough to hold on to some pre-1970s document.

Whereas I am sure that is fine with you, here in reality, that is just silly.
 
 
 
Since she never said Dr. West delivered the baby (that was a connection made by the Buffalo News reporter who wrote the article, not by Nelson), she didn't actually "recant" anything when the WND liars confronted her with false evidence.

 
I asked did we know who delivered the baby, you said we did. Now I see that you are recanting. This is just idiotic dishonesty on your part. Why, what is your 'stake' in this, none that I can imagine.

 
Since all the actual evidence points to Dr. West being a board-certified obstetrician in active practice in 1961 who often delivered babies at Kapo'ilani Hospital and was known for personally recording the birth information from every delivery he performed, the fact that he knew so many details of Obama's birth is a pretty strong indication that Dr. West was personally involved in the delivery of the future president in some capacity.

 
Good grief. You have absolutely no evidence that he delivered O, just supposition.

 
When directly asked if he was born an American, he said that he was, in addition to releasing his certified birth certificate which confirms that beyond a reasonable doubt.

 
He was asked if he was born an American Christian, and said, looking away.... "uh huh"..... LOL.

We not talking about 'reasonable doubt' here, we're looking for the best available evidence, which is the long form birth certificate. There is no reason it should not be made available.

 
Fantasy? I quoted and linked to the explicit statements of State of Hawaii government websites that say exactly that.

 
Baloney.

 
I'd be a lot more hurt by the above accusation if you weren't, y'know, a known dishonest Holocaust denier.

 
Ad hominem. You've earned the official seal of a 'Randi' skeptic. LOL.
 
 
 
So was I!

Though I was born at a military base (Wright-Patterson, in Dayton). So maybe that still counts as the US.

 

me too, in Dayton actually. Guess we're not REAL Amuricans.

I wonder how the OP feels about his main ally on this thread being Saggy, one of the board's holocaust deniers....
 
 
 
I asked did we know who delivered the baby, you said we did. Now I see that you are recanting. This is just idiotic dishonesty on your part.

 
I'm not recanting anything. I think that, based on all the available evidence, that it's extremely likely that Dr. West was the obstetrician who delivered Obama. At the very least, Dr. West was there when it happened, and remembered it occurring (which is the whole point behind the doctor-who-delivered-him canard that birthers like to harp on).

 
Why, what is your 'stake' in this, none that I can imagine.

 
My interest is the desire for truth. Which is pretty much the opposite of your 'stake' in this.

 
Good grief. You have absolutely no evidence that he delivered O, just supposition.

 
No, I have evidence that points to a probable conclusion. Though since you're a Holocaust denier, I already know that you don't understand concepts like "consilience of evidence", so I'm not really expecting you to understand the argument here, either.

 
We not talking about 'reasonable doubt' here, we're looking for the best available evidence, which is the long form birth certificate.

 
No, the best available evidence is the certified record of birth issued by the State of Hawaii and released to the public by Obama, verified and confirmed by the statements of Hawaiian state officials. The "long form" cannot provide any additional probative value to the fact of Obama's undeniable birth in Honolulu, Hawaii, as proven by the released certificate and the statements made about it.

 
There is no reason it should not be made available.

 
Other than, of course, the laws preventing exactly that.
 
 
 
 

I was born in Ohio...

 
You're a Buckeye, so am I.

Not only that but I have my original long form birth certificate!!
 
 
Saggy, since you can't illustrate why  my argument  is wrong, do you now believe that nobody was born in the United States?
 
 
 
No, I have evidence that points to a probable conclusion.

 
We don't know diddley, I agree that Dr. West is the best guess, but it is far from certain. And you said we 'knew'. Why the dishonesty?

And, the only reason we don't know is that O refuses to provide the info.

Are the Rs gonna bring this up in congress? I hope they do, as it'll prevent or at least delay them from doing anything worse ! like invading Pakistan.

scapegoating there. typical birther bs tactic.
...
Cowardly? Hardly. If anything Hillary would have raked Obama over the coals. There wasn't a single day through the Democratic campaigns where Hillary hadn't targeted Obama for an issue or something.

 
Your antipathy has already clouded your vision of me, or you would realize that it was the Republicans I said that are inept and cowardly.

 
You said that they were committing a crime. Surely you agree that criminals should be arrested for their crimes.

 
Ok, as you know, it was a figure of speech, but since you wish to be that meticulous; Yes, you are correct. "Criminal" was my over-statement and I retract it. "Dereliction of duty" stands.

 
Okay, that is not a sufficient answer.

 
Unfortunately for you, your opinion does not dictate my conclusion.

 
I call BS on this. You are obviously not impartial on this issue.

 
The truth is the truth. A courtroom or public hearings in the House of Representatives would be great for some standard of examination, trial, accountability and enforcement. I favor whatever is a best effort at something approaching conclusive resolution to the best of our ability when and as required. For some reason, it seems most of you do not.

 
Perhaps you could answer your own question from earlier that you found so important:
Are you a Democrat/Obama voter/Obama supporter?

 
No/no/no. And no problem.

Because it's not needed. The existence of the released birth certificate, verified as it has been by Hawaii state officials, already answers any question as to the location and circumstances of Barack Obama's birth in a form that is and has been accepted by the entire US legal system.

A hearing would be redundant.
 
 
JudeBrando is avoiding the challenge to find someone with more proof of birth in the US than Obama.

 
... show me any single individual with more evidence for their American birth than Obama. Here's what I will need you to show me:

1. A birth certificate.
2. A newspaper clipping that highlights the birth.
3. Records proving that the mother was present in America at the time of birth.
4. Investigations from multiple fact-checking organizations that have held the documents with their own hands to verify that they exist and are authentic.
5. A press release by at least two officials within the state of birth, verifying that the records are on file.

Good luck.

 
 
 
Not only are there a large number of native Ohioans, I count three (including myself) born in Dayton.

That's just waaaaaayyy beyond coincidence! *LOL*

From all appearances, this whole birth certificate thing is a contrived controversy. I see a lot of parallels with the "Teach the Controversy" catchcry of creationists, where the only controversy is the one they're trying to manufacture.

Same approach appears to be in use for the birth certificate: "why doesn't O provide the proof". But he has... "But what about <insert red herring here>?" Facepalm facepalm

Reasonable doubt was passed a long time ago - what we appear to be dealing with here is unreasonable doubt. If there was ever any hard evidence of O being ineligible to hold the office of President, don't you think that after a several year witch-hunt that it would have surfaced?
 
 
 
Your antipathy has already clouded your vision of me, or you would realize that it was the Republicans I said that are inept and cowardly.

 

Why were they not cowardly in 2000? Again, they had no problem in defending the results of the Florida vote in the Presidential elections of that year. Where did their courage go? Why fight then but not in 2008?

(A Constitutional question: What would happen if a President-elect was indeed later found to be ineligible for the office? Would the office of President then go to the Vice President-elect?)

 
A courtroom or public hearings in the House of Representatives would be great for some standard of examination...

 

Wait, a hearing in the House controlled by the Republicans whom you have said are too cowardly to prove President Obama's ineligibility to hold the office?
 
 
 
Not only are there a large number of native Ohioans, I count three (including myself) born in Dayton.

That's just waaaaaayyy beyond coincidence! *LOL*

 
Actually, they're Australians, operating under a false flag. Our infiltration was becoming a bit obvious...  
 
 
 
Why is a link to the law on the state website Baloney?

Id the State of Hawaii in on this as well?

 
I have not really paid much attention to the issue but I have read several times that Obama has the prerogative of releasing the doc. Never saw it questioned before. So I checked the first link which didn't say a thing about BC's and that was enough for me. Interpreting state statutes is beyond my pay level anyhow.

In any case, O could have a look and tell us what's on the original BC, if he desired, but, he doesn't.

So, the 'legal' can't do it is just baloney, probably formally but in any case effectively.
 
 
 
Just returning to the OP:
"Mr President, you are an American born Christian," while not a question, is a statement which clearly invites President Obama to confirm or deny its veracity. "Uh-huh," though informal, is clearly meant to convey the meaning, "Your statement is correct". Therefore, someone in the press has directly asked President Obama to confirm or deny that he was born in the United States, and he has responded with a confirmation.

 
I accept that it can be interpreted that way, but this is not a technicality, a get out jail free card, a question and case dismissed.

The statement and "uh-huh" was probably deliberately so imprecise, as if reviewed and approved by weasel lawyers. A hypothetical possibility I'm sure... but I'm quite confident that there are top-tier weasel lawyers in abundance in the vicinity.

Beyond that one exchange, which is reasonably and arguably imprecise, uncertain and possibly unclear, as simply evidenced by our difference regarding it,

the matter can be clarified simply by asking a clearer question, if anyone would dare do so. No one dares do so.

IF you support finding out the truth of the matter, no matter what that truth may be, there is no legitimate reason to oppose any well-known and reputable questioner/reporter simply, clearly and directly asking the question:

"Mr. President, where exactly were you born?"

But some of you do not want the truth of the matter openly exposed and known because your own intellectual and moral complicity to the deception is also then openly exposed.

Not to mention the societal eruptions that could be precipitated by the exposure of such a massive story if true. That is certainly another card in this hand we've got, whether you can handle or care to think about it now or not.
 
 
 
Not only are there a large number of native Ohioans, I count three (including myself) born in Dayton.

Plus, I stayed at the Comfort Inn across the street from the Air Force Museum in Dayton.

Now you know it's an evil plot!

So, you vaguely heard about something, admit you never even bothered to question it, clicked only one Hawaii State website link and found it too hard for you to figure out, didn't click the other Hawaii State website link that would have told you that birth certificates are governed by the law from the first link, and then decided that wallowing in your own ignorance was preferable to actually educating yourself as to the truth of the matter?

Can't say I'm surprised, really.

 
In any case, O could have a look and tell us what's on the original BC, if he desired, but, he doesn't.

 
He doesn't have to. The form released actually tells us what was on the original BC (that's what "certified copy" means ). And that fact was even confirmed by the director of the Hawaii Department of Health, meaning Obama's birth is now actually more confirmed than anyone else who has been born in Hawaii!

And even if he did issue a statement saying "I went in and looked at my own records, and yup, they totally say I'm an American," you wouldn't believe him anyway.

As I asked earlier, and y6ou ignored, "What would your follow up question be?

Besides, by the time any legal action was taken to remove him from office, he'll be out of office. It's too late, dude. Even if he gets re-elected, by the time any challenge got through all the legal whoop-dee-do, President Ah-nold will issue a Presidential Pardon!

 
Oh, I know that too. I don't disagree with you and you could have figured out the script there; Obama2/Ah-nold. Wouldn't surprise me anymore.

 
I don't think any questions should be asked under oath. People lie under oath. I think that they should be thrown in the water. If they sink, they're telling the truth. If they float, their witches and should be burned at the stake. Simple, straightforward method of leveraging out the truth.

 

 
I don't think any questions should be asked of birthers under oath. People Birthers lie under oath. I think that they should be thrown in the water. If they sink, they're telling the truth.

I graduated from the University of Dayton!
 
 
So, after we get Pres. Obama to testify under oath about where he was born, can we get him to tell the truth about the secret UFO base at Area 51, the moon landing hoax and the reptilian aliens? These issues have just as much validity as birther claims.

Have birthers stopped insisting that a birth certificate and a certificate of live birth are fundamentally different? If not, and the above were true, that would be awesome.

 
If he's a liar he'll lie and if he isn't then he's already told the truth so the question is pointless.

 

This. It's something that devout truthers are blind to, also, when they insist on putting Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, et al. under oath in an attempt to discover the truth about 9/11.
 
 
 
So, you vaguely heard about something, admit you never even bothered to question it, clicked only one Hawaii State website link and found it too hard for you to figure out, didn't click the other Hawaii State website link that would have told you that birth certificates are governed by the law from the first link, and then decided that wallowing in your own ignorance was preferable to actually educating yourself as to the truth of the matter?

You gave me one bad answer on the law question, which contradicts everything I've read thusfar, and I was disinclined to check the second, suspecting that it would require me to analyze a state statute whose legalese and context I do not know.

Why don't you provide a link to some published article where they make that claim. I still think it's baloney. If you cannot do that, it will confirm my opinion. If you can do it, I'll have to reconsider.

Certified copy cannot mean what you says it means as if it did we would know who delivered him. So, you're lying again. Why?

I would ask him for a description of every field on the form, including the name of the Dr, and to identify every signature. I don't think he could get away with lying about it. I'd believe him.

I don't think this problem is unsolvable, I think O is making it unsolvable.

His army of apologists, I don't really understand.
 
 
 
Unfortunately for you, your opinion does not dictate my conclusion.

 
But it does highlight that your conclusion is not based on evidence or reason.

 
The truth is the truth. A courtroom or public hearings in the House of Representatives would be great for some standard of examination, trial, accountability and enforcement. I favor whatever is a best effort at something approaching conclusive resolution to the best of our ability when and as required. For some reason, it seems most of you do not.

 
You realize this has already been addressed by the Supreme Court and dismissed, don't you? Assuming you do, is it surprising that despite your claim, for you the truth is not the truth?

 
No/no/no. And no problem.

 
And yet, it is a problem or relevant for those who might have answered yes/yes/yes? What were you saying about consistency?
 
 
 
IF you support finding out the truth of the matter, no matter what that truth may be, there is no legitimate reason to oppose any well-known and reputable questioner/reporter simply, clearly and directly asking the question:

"Mr. President, where exactly were you born?"

 
Well, there is a legitimate reason in that it is needless given the ample documentation that is readily evidence and none to the contrary. The question itself neither advances nor hinders finding the truth of the matter.

Regardless, you've said yourself that you would not believe the answer, so what is the point?
 
 
 
Really? That's your explanation?

 
What do you mean "my explanation"? What makes you think I have any interest in explaining anything for the Republicans? I am in favor of anyone in the press asking whatever they want to ask of any Republicans also. The truth is whatever the truth is.
 
The same party that went to court in 2000 to protect the results from Florida and the election of George W. Bush to the Presidency? The same party that fought that case all the way to the Supreme Court? The same party that spent millions of dollars contesting the 2008 Presidential election? The same party that had campaigning master Karl Rove?

 
See, I think that's exactly why this all can continue as it is. Mostly inflexibly loyal political partisans defending their own. Loyal Democrats are so very anti-Republican, anti-Bush that this is  Republican vs. Democrat  and not simply the truth of the matter of Obama.
 
 
 
You gave me one bad answer on the law question

 
No, I gave you the actual law in question.

 
which contradicts everything I've read thusfar

 
That appears to be the real problem you're having here, actually.

 
and I was disinclined to check the second, suspecting that it would require me to analyze a state statute whose context I do not know.

 
No, you were disinclined to click it because you didn't want to face the truth. And, so you can't run away from it any more, I'll even quote what that link says, right here:

 
In light of the unprecedented number of requests for information relating to the vital records of President Barack Hussein Obama II, the DOH has reviewed the requirements of UIPA and the confidentiality provisions of HRS Chapter 338.

Based upon that review, the DOH has determined that the information listed below constitutes all of the publicly available information related to requests for vital statistics records pertaining to President Barack Hussein Obama II, and the only disclosures pertaining to those records that can be made in accordance with Hawaii law. The Department of Health is providing links to copies of the records in the form that they are available to the public.

Birth Certificate or Certificate of Live Birth

State law prohibits the DOH for disclosing any information about a Hawaii vital record unless the requestor has a direct and tangible interest in the record. This includes verification of vital records and all the information contained in a record. Vital records disclosure laws protect all birth, death, marriage and divorce records held by the department and all amendments, changes, supporting records, and requests related to vital records.

Direct and tangible interest is determined by HRS §338-18(b). This statute may be accessed on the state legislative website at:
 http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/hrscur... 0338-0018.htm 

The law that governs vital records in the State of Hawaii is Hawaii Revised Statutes chapter 338, which may be accessed on the state legislature website at:
 http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/hrscurrent/ 

Information on how to order certified copies of vital records in Hawaii and who is eligible to order vital records in Hawaii, is available on the DOH website at:
 http://hawaii.gov/health/vital-recor...rds/index.html 

 
And if you click on that last link, the page it takes you to says:

 
About Vital Records

Vital records (birth, death, marriage, and divorce certificates) for events that occurred in Hawaii are received and preserved by the Office of Health Status Monitoring, a unit of the Department of Health. In Hawaii, access to vital records is restricted by statute (HRS §338-18).

*  Frequently Asked Questions About Vital Records of President Barack Hussein Obama II 

Certified copies of these records may be issued to authorized individuals and used for such diverse purposes as school entry, passports, Social Security participation, driver’s licenses, employment, sports participation, survivor’s benefits, proof of property rights, and other needs.

*  Who is eligible to apply for issuance of certified copies of vital records? 
*  How to apply for issuance of certified copies of vital records. 

 
So, there you go. Birth Certificates are covered under the law I linked you to, and nothing can be done regarding those records except as authorized by that law. And under that law, if you want a copy of the records, you get a certified copy, the form that Obama got. You can't get a long form. You can't even ask for one. And you can easily tell this because the website says it provides the "only disclosures pertaining to those records that can be made in accordance with Hawaii law," and while a certified copy is one of those disclosures, a "long form" is not. Period.

And, just in case you had extra doubts, at the above links you can also read  this official statement  by Dr. Chiyome Fukino, the director of the Hawaii Department of Health, where she says:

 
There have been numerous requests for Sen. Barack Hussein Obama’s official birth certificate. State law (Hawai‘i Revised Statutes §338-18) prohibits the release of a certified birth certificate to persons who do not have a tangible interest in the vital record.

Therefore, I as Director of Health for the State of Hawai‘i, along with the Registrar of Vital Statistics who has statutory authority to oversee and maintain these type of vital records, have personally seen and verified that the Hawai‘i State Department of Health has Sen. Obama’s original birth certificate on record in accordance with state policies and procedures.

 
But wait...that just says that the State of Hawaii has the original, with nothing about whether that original has some information that might cast doubt on whether Obama is a citizen or not.

You're in luck, though, since at the above links you can also  read this followup statement  from Dr. Fukino, where she says:

 
I, Dr. Chiyome Fukino, Director of the Hawai‛i State Department of Health, have seen the original vital records maintained on file by the Hawai‘i State Department of Health verifying Barack Hussein Obama was born in Hawai‘i and is a natural-born American citizen. I have nothing further to add to this statement or my original statement issued in October 2008 over eight months ago.

 
Guess you really should have clicked that link, huh?

 
Why don't you provide a link to some published article where they make that claim.

 
Because only a complete idiot or someone deliberately refusing to accept the truth would think that a third-party article about something would prove it, while the actual first-hand official statements by the relevant state departments does not.

 
I still think it's baloney.

 
 

 
Certified copy cannot mean what you says it means as if it did we would know who delivered him. So, you're lying again. Why?

 
Er, what? That doesn't make any sense. Certified copy does mean what I says, because that's what the form Obama got was. And we can plainly see that said form doesn't list who delivered him.

And the reason for that is plain: on the so-called "long form" that was issued at the time of Obama's birth, the name of the attending physician isn't printed at all. It appears solely as a signature. And since the only form that's issued now is a computer-printed form on which no signatures at all appear (for anyone, not just Obama), then there's no way the name of the doctor would appear and no reason to expect it would.

Unless you're actually denying that the form Obama received and released isn't the certified copy issued by the state if you request it via the links I provided to you (and you refused to look at). Which, frankly, wouldn't surprise me, given your previously-evinced ability to reject plain facts and reality in favor hurling the "liar" epithet at anyone who shows just how wrong your worldview really is.
 
 
 
No, I gave you the actual law in question.

That appears to be the real problem you're having here, actually.

No, you were disinclined to click it because you didn't want to face the truth. And, so you can't run away from it any more, I'll even quote what that link says, right here:

First, you're lying about the meaning of a certified copy as demonstrated in my previous post.

Second, the reason a published article is preferable is because I do not understand the legalese and context of the statutes.

Third, I suspect that the reason you have not provided a published article is because no one responsible person who understands the law would publish such a lie. Prove me wrong or admit there is no such article.

Funny, the  Hawaii Department of Health says I'm right on the money .

 
The state Department of Health no longer issues copies of paper birth certificates as was done in the past, said spokeswoman Janice Okubo.

The department only issues "certifications" of live births, and that is the "official birth certificate" issued by the state of Hawaii, she said.

And, it's only available in electronic form.

Okubo explained that the Health Department went paperless in 2001.

"At that time, all information for births from 1908 (on) was put into electronic files for consistent reporting," she said.

Information about births is transferred electronically from hospitals to the department.

"The electronic record of the birth is what (the Health Department) now keeps on file in order to provide same-day certified copies at our help window for most requests," Okubo said.

Asked for more information about the short-form versus long-form birth documents, Okubo said the Health Department "does not have a short-form or long-form certificate."

"The birth certificate form has been modified over the years and decades to conform to national standards and models," she said.

Okubo also emphasized the certification form "contains all the information needed by all federal government agencies for transactions requiring a birth certificate."

She added that the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the state's current certification of live birth "as an official birth certificate meeting all federal and other requirements."

The issue of what constitutes an official Hawaii birth certificate received national attention during last year's presidential campaign. Those who doubted Barack Obama's American citizenship called the copy of the Hawaii birth document posted on his campaign Web site a fake.

Asked about that document, Okubo said, "This is the same certified copy everyone receives when they request a birth certificate."

 
Exactly as I've been saying all along, Saggy. And that certified copy does not list the delivering doctor.

 
Second, the reason a published article is preferable is because I do not understand the legalese and context of the statutes.

 
No, it's because you don't want to admit that you're wrong, even after I provided you the wording of the law itself, and the plain-text interpretation of that made by the Hawaii Department of Health itself.

 
Third, I suspect that the reason you have not provided a published article is because no one responsible person who understands the law would publish such a lie. Prove me wrong or admit there is no such article.

 
As you can see at the above Honolulu Star-Bulletin link (is that enough of an "article" for you?), your idea of what constitutes "responsible person" and "lie" have no resemblance in any way, shape, or form to reality.

Now, what do you have to say about Dr. Fukino's statements regarding Obama's records confirming he's a citizen. Anything, Saggy?

You said the 'certified copy' contained the info the the long form BC, but it does not, for example, contain the name of the delivering physician. You were/are lying.

I still don't understand the damn statute or even what a 'certified copy' is supposed to mean.

The link was useless.

You'd better watch out, I may google up some info myself ! (Probably not, ain't worth it)

I'll wait on the published article to reconsider my opinion that your info is hopelessly biased and, indeed, wrong.
 
 
 
You said the 'certified copy' contained the info the the long form BC, but it does not, for example, contain the name of the delivering physician.

 
No, it doesn't. It's signed by the delivering physician and the registrar, but the signatures aren't part of the record (they merely verify that the record is correct), and neither name is typed onto the form as a part of the record being created. Therefore neither name appears on the electronic copy because they aren't part of the recorded information.

All of the actual, typed-in information is the same on both types of forms.

 
I still don't understand the damn statute or even what a 'certified copy' is supposed to mean.

 
No, you understand all too well. That's why you're trying so desperately to find a way to avoid acknowledging any of that.

 
The link was useless.

 
It proved you wrong about pretty much everything, in exactly the format you requested it be in.

In fact, let's see it again!

 
The state Department of Health no longer issues copies of paper birth certificates as was done in the past, said spokeswoman Janice Okubo.

The department only issues "certifications" of live births, and that is the "official birth certificate" issued by the state of Hawaii, she said.

You'd better watch out, I may google up some info myself !

 
Maybe you should have done that first, so you could have perhaps avoided coming into this thread and making a fool of yourself.
 
 
 
I still don't understand the damn statute or even what a 'certified copy' is supposed to mean.

 
Even though the link above specifically says that the certified copy is the same as what Obama put on his website?

I'm assuming you are not stupid or illiterate. Surely this was merely an oversight on your part.

 
The link was useless.

 
No to anyone interested in the truth,

 
You'd better watch out, I may google up some info myself !

 
Please do.

 
(Probably not, ain't worth it)

 
Not for your side of the argument it isn't.
 
 
 
You bring up an interesting point. Here on the CT board, you see a lot of what I like to call light-switch skepticism. You see, it's not entirely fair to say that conspiracy theorists are not skeptical. As Jude has illustrated, when it comes to evidence that Obama was born in Hawaii, he is very skeptical, even overly skeptical. His switch is in the on position. But does this make him a skeptic? Well, that's not entirely accurate, either. Just earlier in the thread, he had posted this:

Well, there you go. That settles it. Obama was born in Kenya. Case closed.

 
Scum, what is so difficult to understand? I know, it's not difficult at all, it's deliberate. I can't be any more plain: Did I ever say he was born in Kenya? No. I don't know if he was born in Kenya. I don't know if he was born in Hawaii. He may absolutely have been born in Hawaii. If that is so, then location of birth is not the information of their concern on the birth certificate. Then it could be something else. You know what? Guess what. If it turns out to be something else, I'd be interested in asking what that may be also.

 
This is evidence that points towards the conclusion he likes (Oh, if only Obama weren't actually the president). Time to turn the switch off.

 
What? Do you think I want Biden? What, do you think I want McCain? Unfortunately, I haven't had a horse in this race in a long time now. I am nothing but an observer of our times. Not invested. Maybe, really, I'm just wondering about the truth of this man Obama. Thankfully this isn't a very big audience, or the way things are going, it would probably get me killed. This is much bigger than the good old days of the Arkansas Mafia. Bush/Clinton/Bush delivered to Obama. I'm intrigued by the power game and the players. The Bestseller's List doesn't have plots as good as the realities of our time. Any guesses as to how this book ends?
 I'm just watching the wheels go 'round. 

Which leads me to another thread title also...

And thus, you once again show your desire to wallow in your own ignorance.

 
I'll wait on the published article to reconsider my opinion that your info is hopelessly biased and, indeed, wrong.

 
You mean the  Honolulu Star-Bulletin article I linked you to already , the one that basically torpedoes your entire position regarding the "certified copy" thing, and thus the one that you completely refuse to acknowledge?

The one that has a Department of Health spokeswoman saying:

 
Those who doubted Barack Obama's American citizenship called the copy of the Hawaii birth document posted on his campaign Web site a fake.

Asked about that document, Okubo said, "This is the same certified copy everyone receives when they request a birth certificate."

 
That published article, Saggy?

Why do you assume there is "information of their concern?" There is no legitimate concern or doubt about any information regarding the birth certificate. None. Zero. zilch.

If you don't know where he was born, then it is because you have made no effort to find out. All the information you could possibly need is available and there is no legitimate doubt.

If I am wrong, please give me an example of "information of concern."

 
Maybe, really, I'm just wondering about the truth of this man Obama.

 
Well you have been given the truth and plenty of supporting evidence.
What else do you need before you acknowledge it as "the truth" ?
We will be happy to give it to you.

Plus, he admitted that what "evidence" caused him to start questioning Obama's birth, was the video of Obama's grandmother. A video which has since been shown, without a doubt, to be a blatant misrepresentation of what actually happened. Berg lied by editing a video to make it appear to say the opposite of what it really said.

Jude, I haven't seen you acknowledge this. Do you acknowledge that this video was a lie?

 
No admission, confession, inquisition required. No secret. That was one reason, not the reason. As if this all hinges on any one point or issue. I heard about the birth cert. questions almost 4 years ago and ever since. I saw grandma's video and found it interesting. Then I saw that I couldn't find grandma's video anymore and found that interesting. I remember seeing a Chicago news video about, if I still recall correctly, young "Kenyan-born" state senator Obama... and finding that interesting. Then I remember not being able to again find that old Chicago news video about young Kenyan-born state senator Obama... and found that interesting. If Obama's paternal grandmother video testimony is proven fraudulent, I would find that interesting. I find the entire Obama story interesting. It is quite a web of intrigue.

I'd be interested to see a day of subpoena'd depositions under oath. Imagine if it was all televised? That would be interesting. You know what? You guys would be interested and would be watching.

Why were they not cowardly in 2000? Again, they had no problem in defending the results of the Florida vote in the Presidential elections of that year. Where did their courage go? Why fight then but not in 2008?

 
Who cares about them here and now? If you still must care against them so much, then start a thread about them and say whatever you want to say. Otherwise, moveon.org and get to Obama now if you would, unless we should talk about Clinton so as not to look any closer at Bush so as not to delve any deeper into Obama?

No piece of evidence that I have seen that shows Obama to be a citizen has been shown ot be fake.

I don't claim to be all knowing. Thus there may be evidence on either side that I have missed. If you know of any non-fake evidence for his non-citizenship, please let me know. In the absence of that, my mind will be quite made up.
 
 
 
First, you're lying about the meaning of a certified copy as demonstrated in my previous post.

 
No she/he isn't.

As defined under the LAW, the COLB that is issued by the State Department of Health of Hawaii is considered a CERTIFIED Copy. It contains the DATE, SIGNATURE of the Registrar and the embossed SEAL of the department

 
Second, the reason a published article is preferable is because I do not understand the legalese and context of the statutes.

 
IF YOU don't understand it, then YOU're in no position to second guess its meaning.

I dont understand legalese at all, but the LAW in question, is quite clear to anyone who has a 5th grade vocabulary. You don't need a lawyer to help explain it.
 
 
 
You said the 'certified copy' contained the info the the long form BC, but it does not, for example, contain the name of the delivering physician. You were/are lying.

 
ANT never said that it contained ALL the information found on the original birth record.

SINCE all the information is not needed, only the pertientn information is included on the COLB. ALL that of that information is found on the original birth record.

 
I still don't understand the damn statute or even what a 'certified copy' is supposed to mean.

 
Its explained quite well in the law. Get a 5th grader to help you to understand the VERY simple words they use to tell you what a Certified copy is. Again, you don't need a lawyer to help you explain the law.

Oh and the fact that the spokesperson for the HDoH have clearly stated in their interviews in laymens terms what a certified copy is, is quite telling that you rather just repeat your ignorant views.

I went to King's Island as a teenager. Still have my "The Beast" t-shirt around here some place (do they even still have that ride?) My Mom accidentally bleached it at one point, so it's now a chocolate brown rather than the supper-cool black that it was (The Beast was what we called the pickup I drove in high school) and probably doesn't fit any more, but it's still around.

Let's see, there was The Racer, and the Tidal Wave, and that cool little replica of the Eiffel Tower. Great park.

ETA: okay, the Tidal Wave seems to be gone -- that was a charge: up and around in what I think was the biggest loop in the world at the time. And then backwards the way you came from. "I lost my lunch on the Tidal Wave" was the catch phrase, IIRC.

He claims the released COLB is coutnerfeit. I have seen zero evidence of this. I may have missed this evidence. Do you have a link to it? Why owudl Hawaiian official confirm its authenticity if it is coutnerfeit as they have repeatedly shown to do in evidence presented in this thread?

MCRAE: When I come in December. I would like to come by the place, the hospital, where he was born. Could you tell me where he was born? Was he born in Mombasa?

OGOMBE: No, Obama was not born in Mombasa. He was born in America.

MCRAE: Whereabouts was he born? I thought he was born in Kenya.

OGOMBE: No, he was born in America, not in Mombasa.

MCRAE: Do you know where he was born? I thought he was born in Kenya. I was going to go by and see where he was born.
OGOMBE: Hawaii. Hawaii. Sir, she says he was born in Hawaii. In the state of Hawaii, where his father was also learning, there. The state of Hawaii.

 
Oh oopsies. Phil Berg caught in his misrepresentation of the interview:

 http://www.obamaconspiracy.org/2009/...-obama-speaks/ 
 
 
 
What do you mean "my explanation"? What makes you think I have any interest in explaining anything for the Republicans?

 

Because it is a logical necessity central to any claim of President Obama not being born in Hawaii. Not only does such a claim require direct evidence, it must also pass the logic test (or, if one prefers, indirect evidence).

Thus offering some sort of reasonable explanation as to why the Republicans would let a non-citizen assume the Presidency in direct violation of the Constitution is a key part of furthering any sort of born elsewhere claim.

So, once more, why would the Republican Party, which in 2000 was quite willing to defend its interests vis-a-vis a Presidential election, stand silent in 2008?
 
 
 
You said the 'certified copy' contained the info the the long form BC, but it does not, for example, contain the name of the delivering physician. You were/are lying.

You know what else is interesting?

In each case, you only acknowledge the possibility that you might have been wrong, not that you were wrong, if you acknowledge it at all.

It is almost as if you don't have the intellectual honesty to admit when you are wrong. Don't you find that interesting?

It might be interesting, but faking claims about the President's place of origin isn't illegal. There would be no grounds for bringing Birthers to trial, let alone subpoena them. Of course, if they were to lie under oath as they do on the internet, that would be a different matter. Now, that would be interesting.

Ok, this is so three pages ago, but here goes:

I would consider it a waste of time. The President's birthplace has been legally established by the presentation of the Hawaii COLB listing his place of birth.

Absent credible evidence that this document was fraudulent, and absent a plausible alternative scenario, there seems no point.
 
 
 
Unfortunately for you, your opinion does not dictate my conclusion.
The truth is the truth.

 
If you truly believed this, you would have retracted your 'doubts' in the face of the evidence that has been presented in this thread. In reality, no amount of evidence would be enough for you and Saggy. You two would simply move the goalposts, cry "FORGERY!" or whatever else it took to keep this fantasy alive. It's pathetic, actually.

 
the matter can be clarified simply by asking a clearer question, if anyone would dare do so. No one dares do so.

 
Nope. You've already stated that Obama answering that direct question wouldn't satisfy you.

 
The truth is whatever the truth is.

 
Unless it's presented with evidence you don't agree with; evidence that contradicts your worldview.

 
I still don't understand the damn statute or even what a 'certified copy' is supposed to mean.

 
So your failure to understand or comprehend something equalls it being incorrect? Really?
 
 
I'm sure this has been asked, but can Jude or Saggy explain what the problem is with the birth certificate that has been shown?
 
 
 
Actually, they're Australians, operating under a false flag. Our infiltration was becoming a bit obvious...  

 
Having NIcole Kidman being a "Birthright Citizen" was a really nice touch......
 
 
 
Certified copy cannot mean what you says it means as if it did we would know who delivered him. So, you're lying again. Why?

 
A "certified" copy means EXACTLY what he says it means. THe State "Certifies" that the information contained on it is correct and true. In this case Hawaii "certifies" that Obama was born in Hawaii on the date stated in the document. That is it. End of story.

But, you want the magic, double wink wink extra special certified hidden document that only the illuminati and holocaust deniers get to see or know exists.

I also oppose it. You see, if we take EVERY question to court, no matter how idiotic, the courts will shut down under the pressure of question people under oath if, in fact, the sky is blue and whether, if no one is around when the Pope ***** int he woods, if it makes a sound.

Why would we put someone under oath to tell us what we ALREADY KNOW and what has ALREADY BEEN PROVEN?

As I have said before, there is not a single piece of evidence of which I am ware, that even remotely suggests that Obama is not American. If there is one, please make me aware of it so that I can change my stance. In the meantime, when there is zero evidence otherwise, why would I support wasting the court's time?

Truly amazing: Birthers' best piece of "evidence" actually says Obama was born in Hawaii. They got a "yes" from the interpreter to "Were you present when Obama was born in Kenya?", which Obama's grandmother probably interpreted as "Were you in Kenya when Obama was born?", then multiple efforts to tell the interviewer that Obama was born in Hawaii which were conveniently ignored. Quote mining at it's finest.

In post 174, I likened it to Hiroo Onoda. He gave up after 29 years. Maybe some of these guys will wise up sooner.
 
 
Seems to me that there is an inflated faith in the power of a subpeona and oaths much like the 9/11 stuff. In order to show that the subpeona was not complied with or that perjury took place it is still necessary that that fact be proved. Just because the material provided under subpeona do not prove or confirms one's beliefs does not mean that one can then claim that material was withheld and that the providers were engaged in contempt of court. Same thing with oathed testimony.

It should be noted that in discovery this (I think) cuts both ways. The defendants will have access or the ability to subpeona ALL the material that the plaintiffs have. If the plaintiffs withhold material and then try to spring it on the defendants later I don't think the court would look too kindly on that.

In any case, if it came to a suit, I don't think I can conceive of anyone being able to make a good enough case to even begin to overcome the burden of proving their allegations sufficiently to get to beyond a summary dismissal hearing much less proceed into discovery.

Of course IANAL.  
 
 
 
Why is it important who delivered him if there is no question as to where?

Funny that people -- this is an ad hominin -- seemingly so worried about how awful Obama is undermining the freedom of Americans are so quick to "put him under oath" and therefore the penalty of law without anything even resembling a honest, reasonable suspicion that a crime has been or is being commited. There is NO evidence of lying, disembling, fraud, etc. NO evidence. There is no evidence that a court would even accempt (as shown by the complete failure of ALL lawsuits on the matter) that the documentation provided is anything other than what it purports to be...proof, certified by the State of Hawaii that Obama was born in the state of Hawaii.

In short, it is a sort of "don't tread on me...tread on him" philosophy that is not only profoundly irrational but positively unAmerican.

Absent credible evidence that this document was fraudulent, and absent a plausible alternative scenario, there seems no point.

 
I bring this point up to birthers all the time. The (then) REPUBLICAN governor and the (then) REPUBLICAN ATTORNEY GENERAL of the state of Hawaii had ample time to present a case against Obama for violation of the following state statute:

§338-30 Penalties....
(b) Any person who wilfully makes or alters any certificate or certified copy thereof provided for in this part except in accordance with this part, shall be fined not more than $1,000, or imprisoned not more than six months, or both.

Birthers can never explain why they did not do so.
 
 
In fact, I woudl venture that the Gov. of Hawaii and the Head of the Health Department had an active obligation to report any seeming wilful alteration, otherwise they would be leaving themselves open to accusations of culpability...and yet, nary a peep, other than to confirm that the CLB is what it says it is, the only valid state recofd of Obama's birht in Hawaii.
 
 
 
You gave me one bad answer on the law question, which contradicts everything I've read thusfar, and I was disinclined to check the second, suspecting that it would require me to analyze a state statute whose legalese and context I do not know.

 
No, you were given a correct answer to the question, both with the actual legal language and in a plainly written explanation by the state. But because it contradicts what you vaguely remember seeing somewhere, you dismiss it.

 
Why don't you provide a link to some published article where they make that claim. I still think it's baloney. If you cannot do that, it will confirm my opinion. If you can do it, I'll have to reconsider.

 
That was done, and yet you did not reconsider. So, you lied. (And by the way, by your standards something is more likely to be true if you find an article somewhere that says so, than by going straight to the source? That explains a lot.)

 
I would ask him for a description of every field on the form, including the name of the Dr, and to identify every signature.

 
Again, why? There is nothing suspicious about any of the answers he has given, or about the published birth certificate. There is no need for further questioning, not for Obama or anyone else.

 
First, you're lying about the meaning of a certified copy as demonstrated in my previous post.

 

 
I still don't understand the damn statute or even what a 'certified copy' is supposed to mean.

 
Do you see the contradiction here? You don't understand it, but you accuse people who do understand it of lying. Based on what?

 
Second, the reason a published article is preferable is because I do not understand the legalese and context of the statutes.

 
You know that makes absolutely no sense, right? The fact that you understand one source better than another does nothing to show which source is more reliable. A published article is worthless, unless the facts it contains can be verified.

It's a silly argument. And it's rather obvious that you have been backed into a corner, and came up with the lame "it's too hard to understand, so I refuse to believe it" defense because you can't think of anything else to say. Particularly since it's not actually hard to understand.
 
 
 
No, you were given a correct answer to the question, both with the actual legal language and in a plainly written explanation by the state. But because it contradicts what you vaguely remember seeing somewhere, you dismiss it.

That was done, and yet you did not reconsider. So, you lied. (And by the way, by your standards something is more likely to be true if you find an article somewhere that says so, than by going straight to the source? That explains a lot.)

I find the newspaper announcement of Obama's birth in Hawaii to be more damning evidence than anything.

I can guarantee you that no one in 1961 was thinking that the child of a white Kansan and a black Kenyan was going to grow up to be president. At the time his parents could be arrested in several states for sleeping together.

The mother was American so Barack was going to have American citizenship no matter where he was born. If Obama was born in Kenya there was absolutely no reason to 'plant' an article in a Hawaiian newspaper. For the birthers to be right someone would have had to plant a birth notice in 1961. That's just ludicrous.

I can make the argument for the other side that his mother wouldn't have wanted people thinking he was born in Kenya, the technicalities of citizenship aside, and so placed the birth announcement so he could say he was American-born. No presidential aspirations needed.
 
 
Seeing that it was posted 4 days after Obama was born, that is a fast return trip from Kenya at a time it would have taken a full 7 days to travel.
 
 
Who's to say that the birth announcement was actually placed by his mother herself?

This is a bit scary, I've debated enough truthers to tell you exactly what they'll say.

Then why the (bleep) would she have gone to Kenya, when all she needed to do for people to think he was born in Hawaii was to stay in Hawaii?

Which, also, brings us to Headscratcher´s question nobody can answer: why tracel to Kenya at all, while eight or nine months pregnant, and how did she manage not to leave a paper trail while doing so?
 
 
 
Who's to say that the birth announcement was actually placed by his mother herself?

 
Because the newspapers didn't print announcements based on information provided by parents (or other relatives), but based on information from the hospitals themselves.

So, the only way a birth announcement for Obama to have appeared in a Honolulu newspaper, would be for him to have been born in a Honolulu hospital.

You can watch WingNutDaily try to spin away the statements from both the newspaper people and the department of health directly to WND making that explicitly and directly clear, right  here .

Rev. Wright had to give him his Muslim baptism right at birth, it keeps better that way.
 
 
 
Who's to say that the birth announcement was actually placed by his mother herself?

 
couldn't. Hawaii law at the time, birth announcements were only retrieved from the Department of Health and Vital Statistics (this has been covered already in the huge birther thread that I've linked to repeatedly).

The DoHVS got their information straight from the hospitals

So unless Stanely Ann Dunham within 2 hours of giving birth to Obama, took a supersonic jet back to Hawaii to then break into the records at Kapiolani Medical Center and forged a certificate without anyone noticing (complete with Doctor's signature and Attending Nurse's signature), before that following Monday, it was impossible for her to place any birth announcement; and the DoHVS didn't notice the forgery.
 
 
Notice that these guys always seem to be disgusting racists?
 
 
 
I can make the argument for the other side that his mother wouldn't have wanted people thinking he was born in Kenya, the technicalities of citizenship aside, and so placed the birth announcement so he could say he was American-born. No presidential aspirations needed.

 
How did she get the child from Kanya to Hawaii?
 
 
I just looked at a globe. The antipodal point from Hawaii is Botswana, not Kenya, but they are surprisingly close. That would have been one helluva trip in 1961.

ETA: It is not really an issue in this discussion, but was technology in 1961 advanced enough that one could make a phone call between the two locations?

Actually, the announcements were placed by the DOH when the birth certificate was received from the hospital.

Plots and conspiracies aren't required, but there is propaganda directing you away from the truth? You can't have your cake and eat it too, JB.

There is such a thing, you know, as being so open minded that your brains fall out. You allow for the possibility that Obama was not born in Hawaii. Okay, do you have any reason to believe this is true? So far, all evidence you've referenced has been fake: from photoshopped Kenya signs to creatively edited videos of Obama's grandmother.

It is fair to be open minded to a possibility when the possibility still has a chance of being true, but the question has been settled. There is no possible way Obama was born outside the US without an extraordinary sequence of highly improbable events occurring that would lead to a current set of evidence showing what it does today.

It's akin to insisting that the literal Biblical creation story could true and that God might have gone to extraordinary lengths to make it appear that it wasn't.

Nope. Transatlantic communication wasn't commonly available in August of 1961 from Kenya (Africa).  It wasn't available till the following year (July 1962)  and it was via Radio.

eghad, i remember that this was debunked in 2008 when the Kenyan "travel" theory was proposed.

Wow, did you miss the part where we have stated over and over again the Department of Health and Vital Statistics was the only department that posts birth announcements in the State of Hawaii to the newspapers?

Yes you did, because you wouldn't have replied with this ignorant answer.

 
No, just that bigotry, plots and conspiracies aren't required for fair, obvious and honest questions to arise, despite what all the propaganda will tell you. That you display an allowance and toleration for the slightest bit of open-minded consideration against the tide here is commendable.

 
Yet you repeat the claims of known racists and bigots. The first Obama birth conspiracies was developed by ANDY MARTIN, a KNOWN racist, anti-semite and bigot. All birthers who followed (Phil Berg, Orly Taitz, Dr. K(h)ate) have taken his play book and ran with the claims without realizing just exactly who they were parroting.

No open minds needed. When the original claims come from racists about a duly elected black man in our highest office, there is no "wondering" needed as to where they pulled their lies from.
 
 
 
eghad, i remember that this was debunked in 2008 when the Kenyan "travel" theory was proposed.

 
Actually I believe this is the case with most of the notions surrounding the birther conspiracy theories, and this is the point in which I become frustrated. Literally this is by far the easiest of conspiracy theories to debunk, because the information is right there in front of anyone who wishes to actually look at it.

From my experience most birthers simply refuse to actually look at the information. I mean honestly there is a thread in this section which actually stands as something of a catalog of birther CT's, and why they are wrong.

Honestly I imagine at some point this thread will turn into an argument of Vattel like most others or stagnate in a constant "why won't he just show the birth certificate?" and a refusal to acknowledge that the COLB is the only required proof.
 
 
I simply find it amazing that the Republican Party, which fought so hard to protect the results of the 2000 election, would simply roll over and say nothing when a person not legally entitled to be President was nominated. It would have provided the Republicans with one of the greatest weapons they ever could have had against the Democrats. It would have been a chance to thoroughly embarrass and humiliate the party, to portray the Democrats as so hopelessly incompetent they couldn't even properly check the status of who they were nominating as candidate for President.

And yet we are to believe, in spite of being handed golden opportunity, they simply stood mute.

That sound you hear is the sound of credulity being stretched well past its breaking point...

Republicans? Other Democrats would have tore Obama apart if there was any truth to the birther claims. There is enough drive for power in any political party to motivate an opponent to use something like to gain the nomination. Heck many of the original birthers came from the PUMA members who were desperately looking for any reason to disqualify Obama from the nomination.

The birther conspiracy theory requires us to suspend disbelief and accept a conspiracy that reaches to not only to numerous political offices but is bi-partisan in nature and is able to overcome the infighting within a party itself.

Simply put...it is the most well executed conspiracy ever, ever.
 
 
I would like to ask JB a question at this point.

JudeBrando, with the excellent, verifiable information in this thread and a preponderance of the evidence shown, and the thorough debunking of the arguments you posted, do you now accept that Obama was born in the US?

Is the matter settled for you? If not, why?
 
 
 
Republicans? Other Democrats would have tore Obama apart if there was any truth to the birther claims.

 

Perhaps so. But let's assume for the sake of argument that the Democrats decided to keep this particular bit of 'dirty laundry' behind closed doors for the sake of party unity.

I will go along with your hypothesis for the sake of JREF unity, but I do want to point out that the birthers are almost always the same folks that believe that H. Clinton literally has blood on her hands. She is a stone-cold killer capable of doing anything to gain and keep power. She is a lesbian who pretends to be straight just to further her ends. Her Machiavellian lust for power knows no bounds, but she just rolled over and let a non-American become president.

It goes even beyond what you describe. Many Republicans (including those in office) believe that President Obama's primary goal is to destroy America. He wants to bring this great country to its knees and chop off its head. That's the guy that they won't drop a dime on.
 
 
 
How did she get the child from Kanya to Hawaii?

 

How did he/she get the fake birth certificate into the Hawaii record base so that when it was converted to electroinc data it was recorded as "born in Hawaii"?

My point is that one of the great birther lies (we see Saggy making it) is that somehow the underlying document for the Hawaii issued CLB has more complete information and, thus, should be "shown"...the true birthers, not merely the trolls...believe that the underlying document says he wasn't born in Hawaii...note that Saggy hasn't made that claim, only that the underlying record has some information that we don't have (usually, it is along the lines of it shows he was adopted or maybe even made an indonesian citizen...though why a static birth record made at the time of birth in 1960 would show such changes in status i don't know...from personal experience, my father's name was changed in the State of Maryland in 1927 -- four years after his birth -- i"ve a copy of his State issued Birth Certificate and the Court document changing his name, they are not one and the same or connected).

My point is for the underlying now electronic (I assume microfiche? some other data-type?) to have information that is vastly different than what is available through the released and verified CLB, you have to assume that there was some sort of knowing manipulation of the paper record prior to it being stored electronically. Who? Why? Back when they changed the records to elecronic format, the notion that Barak Obama would be President someday was pretty absurd, or at least far fetched. Further, nothing in the record...even had he been born in Kenya...would have disqualified him from the Senate or other political jobs that he held.

So, who and why were the records changed? Because it should be clear that the CBL reflects what was on the original, now electronic file?

You quicly get to a level of absurdity and metaphysics that is rediculous beyond all measure...
 
 
Why didnt John McCain mention this when they were both running for President?
 
 
 
JudeBrando... I am fascinated by your ability to look at a mountain of facts and still claim you don't have enough information to draw a conclusion.

Your behavior remains consistent with one who wants to keep a question open rather than settle it, as one with intellectual honesty would.

 
He's also a sufferer from xianity.
 
 
 
No, just that bigotry, plots and conspiracies aren't required for fair, obvious and honest questions to arise, despite what all the propaganda will tell you. That you display an allowance and toleration for the slightest bit of open-minded consideration against the tide here is commendable.

 
I'm sorry, but "who's to say that his mother didn't place the notice herself to cover for her secret trip to Kenya" is by definition a plot. It's ridiculous that you might actually believe pointless speculation in the desperate hope that maybe, just maybe one of the theories will stick and it will turn out that Barack Obama didn't technically get elected President of the United States. Here's an example of an obvious, fair, and honest question:

What evidence is there that Barack Obama was not born in the United States?

There have been multiple instances of evidence being presented that Barack Obama was born in the United States. So far, all you have for "evidence" is a bunch of quotes from some people JAQing off.
 
 
 
Possible legitimate reason. Another is that family there listed it there anyway. What's a couple of days?

 
Others have addressed this, I think.

 
No, just that bigotry, plots and conspiracies aren't required for fair, obvious and honest questions to arise, despite what all the propaganda will tell you. That you display an allowance and toleration for the slightest bit of open-minded consideration against the tide here is commendable.

 
Honest questions, however, that have very good answers that would settle it to satisfaction, if one were willing to APPLY information received.

I appreciate the compliment but I can't return it. You're not being open-minded, in fact you're being rather obtuse. You've shown no ability to actually react to new information, just to move from one talking point to the next when you don't have a good rebuttal. Again, signs of someone wanting to artificially sustain doubt where none need exist--to influence those who are not familiar with the facts.

Unfortunately you will not find easy pickings here.
 
 
 
You allow for the possibility that Obama was not born in Hawaii. Okay, do you have any reason to believe this is true? So far, all evidence you've referenced has been fake: from photoshopped Kenya signs to creatively edited videos of Obama's grandmother.

 
I was thinking about this. There is clear evidence of a real plot out there: there are people who are clearly faking evidence in order to manipulate public opinion. Those people are the ones who deceptively edited the video, photoshopped the Kenya sign, and planted false rumors (easily proven false!) about what constitutes a valid birth certificate, etc.

And birthers are frantically waving their hands in the air, shouting "me! me! I'm gullible! I'll believe it!"

For all their pretense of just asking questions, they ask no questions of those promoting birther CT. They don't seem remotely offended or upset that people fabricate evidence that makes them look silly when they post it.

What misplaced outrage!
 
 
I personally don't see a racist factor in this, or care if they become embarassed. Just...

Hurts Obama=good.
Defends Obama=bad.

Alright... prove me wrong though... Saggy, JudeBrando--any other "birthers"...

Is there ANY claim that is critical of Obama that you think is probably untrue and unjustified?
 
 
 
For all their pretense of just asking questions, they ask no questions of those promoting birther CT. They don't seem remotely offended or upset that people fabricate evidence that makes them look silly when they post it.

Have they started blaming disinfo agents yet?
That's the usual way this goes when a CTers "evidence" is shown to be utter rubbish, or downright lies. They blame the originator of the evidence for being a disinfo agent...
 
 
I'm sure it's just a coincidence that the Birthers I know are also open bigots who toss around "the N Word" with impunity. No correlation there whatsoever...
 
 
Plenty of correlation--actual racists will love the "Birther" stuff, but it's not limited to racists. Lots believe it for two reasons--- 1) they are politically opposite the president and want it to be true so that he'll go away, and 2) it's exciting to think you've learned a secret that only brave people want to talk about.

A new version of the Emperor's New Clothes, so to speak.
 
 
 
They blame the originator of the evidence for being a disinfo agent...

 

It's amusing how conspiracy theorists in general take pride in their supposed ability to sift through the lies and misinformation to find The Real Truth, yet are so easily deceived by anyone offering up fake evidence to support their position.

Hey, conspiracy theorists... if you find that more and more of your once-trusted sources and leaders are turning out to be disinformation agents, the problem is you, not them.
 
 
Yeah, there's plenty of just stupid people around to pick up on this.
 
 
 
Have they started blaming disinfo agents yet?

Yes, actually. The fake Kenyan birth certificates have been blamed on Obama disinfo agents by Orly Taitz.
 
 
 
I saw Obama swear an oath. Maybe you missed it?

"I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States."

 
If I remember right, that was effed-up too, for what it's worth, if anything...
Yeah, then he did another later, they say...

It's curious, very curious, everywhere curious,
unless you're not...
 
 
I'll ask again.

JudeBrando, with the excellent, verifiable information in this thread and a preponderance of the evidence shown, and the thorough debunking of the arguments you posted, do you now accept that Obama was born in the US?

You keep using that word, I do not think it means what you think it means.

To you it means ignoring the difference between plausible and implausible speculations. I don't know about you, but sooner or later I have to actually make up my mind.

Will you still be asking after he's no longer president? What good did that do? When does your uncertainty translate into action?
 
 
 
OK. lets play..,.

 
No.

Your words and tone, on the record in this thread, have already sufficiently shown to my satisfaction, that a strict commitment to the truth of the matter is not the priority to you. Something else is for your own reasons. There is no point in my going further with you in any way. We do not have the same purposes. We are incompatible. I have nothing further to say to you and I will not play with you.

 
When I got a job with the federal government, I had to show them my cert of live birth. I assure you, pulling a blueish-pinkish paper out of my pocket, showing it to a guy, and him checking a box is not "interesting" and I wouldn't advise anyone waste their time watching something that boring.

 
I assure you, lest you were mistaken, absolutely no one gives a bat crap about your anything or finds it in any way "interesting," and we agree again, no one is or will be watching.

I'm fairly confident that we can all unanimously agree...

 
So, once more, why would the Republican Party, which in 2000 was quite willing to defend its interests vis-a-vis a Presidential election, stand silent in 2008?

 
I support Corsair asserting that any member of the press ask whoever he/they feel is most appropriate to ask and also starting a thread to make his significant point that needs making...
 
 
I want to go back to the opening post.

If President Obama committed a crime, then why should the press be investigating it? Isn't that the role of the Justice Department or the FBI or Congress or the Hawaiian State Police ("book him, Danno, first degree forgery")?

And let me re-reiterate again: until you provide a plausible reason why the Republican Party is not lifting a finger to prosecute President Obama, your fanciful speculation is not worth taking seriously.

................

Go, Team Obama!
 
 
 
In any case, if it came to a suit, I don't think I can conceive of anyone being able to make a good enough case to even begin to overcome the burden of proving their allegations sufficiently to get to beyond a summary dismissal hearing much less proceed into discovery.

 
Yes, getting to discovery is the critical threshold, the prevention of which is exactly what Obama's legal team is tasked with performing.

That point alone, more than any other, should be enough for anyone who cares about the truth.

"On the legal front is the dramatic case of Lt. Col. Terrence Lakin, who challenged Obama's eligibility as an Army officer and could face prison for his decision. The goal of his case, like others, is to reach the level of discovery, so that Obama's documentation becomes public."

That point alone, more than any other, should be enough for anyone who cares about the truth.

 
I care abotu the truth, but I also hate wild goose chases.

Can you give me ANY reason to suppose that this is not a wild goose chase?

Can you give me a single piece of evidence that is not clearly forged?

To be clear: I am not asking for proof of Obama's non-citizenship. I am asking for a single piece of evidence that would cast some doubt on it. Any at all.

LTC Lakin has pleaded guilty to charges of disobeying lawful orders. This is the man you want to use as your poster child?
 
 
 
Funny that people -- this is an ad hominin -- seemingly so worried about how awful Obama is undermining the freedom of Americans are so quick to "put him under oath" and therefore the penalty of law without anything even resembling a honest, reasonable suspicion that a crime has been or is being commited. There is NO evidence of lying, disembling, fraud, etc. NO evidence. There is no evidence that a court would even accempt (as shown by the complete failure of ALL lawsuits on the matter) that the documentation provided is anything other than what it purports to be...proof, certified by the State of Hawaii that Obama was born in the state of Hawaii.

In short, it is a sort of "don't tread on me...tread on him" philosophy that is not only profoundly irrational but positively unAmerican.

 

Or... imagine this... click your heels and imagine...

Instead of celebrating the corruption of our legal system,

just one prominent person in the press with access to the president asked him a simple and clear question. Not done even once in the entire campaign and not once in more than two years in office...

and none of you critical-thinkers are skeptical...

You don't want anyone in the press to ask Obama

and

you don't want his testimony under oath.

What other discussion do you seek?
 
 
 
 
OK let's play

 
No.

Your words and tone, on the record in this thread, have already sufficiently shown to my satisfaction, that a strict commitment to the truth of the matter is not the priority to you. Something else is for your own reasons. There is no point in my going further with you in any way. We do not have the same purposes. We are incompatible. I have nothing further to say to you and I will not play with you.

 
OK, I now accept that you have not got the faintest idea as to where you want to go with this subject, and have reached the trolling stage, because you do not appear to have a clue what you are talking about. You don't even seem to understand the subject at hand, and what you want to do about it.

Norm
 
 
 
Wow, did you miss... ignorant answer... racists and bigots... conspiracies... racist, anti-semite and bigot. All birthers... parroting... No open minds needed... racists... black man... they... their lies from.

 
Thought I'd help you emphasize a bit more.

 
Actually I believe... this is the point in which I become frustrated. Literally this is by far the easiest... anyone who wishes to actually look at it... From my experience... refuse to actually look... I mean honestly... Honestly...

 
ASK OBAMA. ?!
 
 
 
You don't want anyone in the press to ask Obama

and

you don't want his testimony under oath.

 
Now you're not even reading what you're responding to before you just make something up. Care to try again?
 
 
You know, kidding aside, I really am beginning to think that we need to get Birthers some involuntary psychiatric help.
 
 
 
I'm sure it's just a coincidence that the Birthers I know are also open bigots who toss around "the N Word" with impunity. No correlation there whatsoever...

 
All the bigots I've known and know daily, as apparently defined by those that toss around "the N Word" with impunity, are Obama voters and unquestioning supporters. Could there be a coincidence or correlation there?

 
I'll ask again.

 
Did you ever notice that everyone that has a question that gets passed over thinks it's because their question is so overwhelmingly incisive and compelling? No one ever says, hmmm, maybe it was dumb and that's why. Quote and respond to 47 out of 50 and 2 out of the other 3 will say something like "Yeah, how come you didn't answer my question? What's the matter, huh? Yeah, I thought so, run away, huh?"

 
JudeBrando, with the excellent, verifiable information in this thread and a preponderance of the evidence shown, and the thorough debunking of the arguments you posted, do you now accept that Obama was born in the US?
Is the matter settled for you? If not, why?

 
Perhaps this little dog and pony thread was a JREF  People's Court  of evidentiary discovery and examination to your kangaroo court satisfaction, but I happen to think the United States of America deserves a little better than this.
 
 
 
Thought I'd help you emphasize a bit more.

ASK OBAMA. ?!

 
I'm gonna parrot a point that Ladewig made really early on in this thread. You've already pointed out that you would not be satisfied with him being directly asked, and directly answering, "I was born in Hawaii." So, what would satisfy you? His confession of being born in Kenya?

Let's suppose for a minute that this conspiracy is really as vast as you say. You've cited somebody pointing out that this is a collaboration of the Democratic Party, at both the state and federal level, all collectively working towards this one end. It's required the fabrication of documents dating back nearly half a century. This is the only way it could possibly work. It has to be a massive cover-up like the world has never known...

Anderson Cooper: Mr. President, where were you born?
Barack Obama: Well, you caught me. I cannot tell a lie. I was born in Kenya.

Do you really think this is how it would play out? Seriously?
 
 
 
What other discussion do you seek?

 

This hasn't been a discussion for quite some time. It's more an attempt by others to get your brain off of the floor. Unfortunately, you seem to be stepping on it...
 
 
 
Did you ever notice that everyone that has a question that gets passed over thinks it's because their question is so overwhelmingly incisive and compelling? No one ever says, hmmm, maybe it was dumb and that's why. Quote and respond to 47 out of 50 and 2 out of the other 3 will say something like "Yeah, how come you didn't answer my question? What's the matter, huh? Yeah, I thought so, run away, huh?"

 
I don't believe you understand how hilarious this irony is, and how it correlates directly to the nature of this thread. Despite the fact that I think you're trolling the thread, I have serious doubts that even you get it.

If you typed that intentionally, then I would like to congratulate you on a job well done.
 
 
 
I want to go back to the opening post.

If President Obama committed a crime, then why should the press be investigating it? Isn't that the role of the Justice Department or the FBI or Congress or the Hawaiian State Police ("book him, Danno, first degree forgery")?

And let me re-reiterate again: until you provide a plausible reason why the Republican Party is not lifting a finger to prosecute President Obama, your fanciful speculation is not worth taking seriously.

................

Go, Team Obama!

 
What is "the role of the press"?
 
 
 
LTC Lakin has pleaded guilty to charges of disobeying lawful orders. This is the man you want to use as your poster child?

 
A reference = "poster child"?

"Use"?

He is crushed.
 
 
 
What is "the role of the press"?

 
Not to indict people for crimes.

Not to waste the time of the duly elected president.

Not to engage in snipe hunts.

As I said before, asking President Obama if he was born in Hawaii is as stupid as asking President Obama if the Apollo missions really landed on the moon.
 
 
 
If I remember right, that was effed-up too, for what it's worth, if anything...
Yeah, then he did another later, they say...

It's curious, very curious, everywhere curious,
unless you're not...

 
No, it's not worth anything. Not all dots connect. Sometimes, it turns out that the dot - connectors are just paranoid schizophrenics, which is obvious.

 
What is "the role of the press"?

 
To report stuff. And maybe lesserly, to report mis-use of quotation marks. (ETA - quoting yourself, in addition to being a sign of megalomania, is on the JREF forum a 'mark of woo')
 
 
On this general topic:

YouTube Video This video is not hosted by the JREF. The JREF can not be held responsible for the suitability or legality of this material. By clicking the link below you agree to view content from an external website.   I AGREE 

(see 53 seconds in)

There was a video that was aired not too long ago of a group of Iowan voters, where the issue of the President Obama's citizenship came up as a topic of conversation. There were Birthers present, and over a third of the focus group raised their hands when asked if they believed that the Obama was a Muslim- this is not strictly the citizenship issue, but I bring it up because the two are interrelated.

These people seemed to be in agreement when asked whether or not this fact fundamentally governed his decisions in office, that it did. When some of the people who didn't raise their hands with regards to that question but were also disapproving of Obama chimed in, they said things like that his "religion" was liberalism, and that he was "sympathetic" to Muslims, even if he may not be a practicing one, himself.

It would stand to reason that there is exponentially less credible evidence that the President is a Muslim, compared to him being a non-citizen- and that's a bold claim on my part, because the latter has essentially zero evidence in its support. But a significant amount of this group of people seemed to believe it.

A local talk radio host mentioned a last month when this story was new, that if there were a poll asking if George W. Bush was retarded, that many people would answer in the affirmative. That is, if this poll was asked during the lowest point of Bush's popularity, that some people, even those who don't believe that to be the case, would answer that he is a retarded, deranged person, etc.

I wonder if there's a similar problem here. More specifically, that people are focusing on Obama's seeming otherness as a focal point for their disapproval and/or distrust. I'm not sure how one would think that Obama is Muslim-sympathetic (whatever the subtext of that would be), as he's been  droning the hell out of Muslims  at a much higher rate than his predecessor in office, has continued the wars in both Iraq and Afghanistan, etc. With regards to being super-liberal, one would have to assume you couldn't have this view and assume him to be a Muslim, as the most common American perception of Muslims is that they are socially and religiously conservative.

At it's root, at least for those who are irrevocably cynical of Obama in some ways, is a self-perpetuating paradox: If he's a Muslim or a non-citizen, then he's also a liar (and a criminal in the latter case). He won't admit to being either, and therefore on top of belonging to a genre of human being which is distrusted, is patently dishonest- and perhaps sinister in hidings his motivations. The idea that he's not admitting to being either because he is neither of those things is an impossibility in the minds of some people, as threads like this demonstrate.

If he were to state (that is, "confess") to being either a Muslim or non-citizen it is still a win for those who mistrust him based on those two issues. However, because he never will, there will always be something he's "hiding" and there will always be good reason to mistrust him.

TL;DR version: He will always be a witch, because he will never admit to being a witch, and thus you will always be right for harassing or persecuting him.
 
 
 
What is "the role of the press"?

 
To ask the president important and non-ridiculous questions, like "Are you in league with the Saucer Men from Mars?".

 
They don't seem remotely offended or upset that people fabricate evidence that makes them look silly when they post it.

What misplaced outrage!

 
This is what is so baffling about CTs. They literally enjoy being lied to.
 
 
 
Thought I'd help you emphasize a bit more.

ASK OBAMA. ?!

 
You know... I just thought "Lucky Obama, after all this trouble of going to Kenya, highly pregnant, smuggling him back into the country, forging documentation nobody so far has done the thing to solve the mystery and just ask him."

But then I realized: He has to rely on documentation too. Can't expect a newlyborn to tell the difference between a Hawaiian hospital and one in Kenya.
I mean, I don't know where I was born. I have pretty good evidence, I believe, from what my mom said, and a BC. But I can't say I recall being born there.

That said I wonder why Jude is still avoiding to post a thread on this topic. I hear he spent 20$ bribing mods on this board, just so he doesn't have to.
 
 
 
"On the legal front is the dramatic case of Lt. Col. Terrence Lakin, who challenged Obama's eligibility as an Army officer and could face prison for his decision. The goal of his case, like others, is to reach the level of discovery, so that Obama's documentation becomes public."
 http://www.wnd.com/?pageId=197557#ixzz1Fy5ZjMd4 

 
If you continue to use sources that are non-credible, no one is going to take you seriously (too late).

wND twisted the facts (as they do with everything they post) about the Lt. Lakin Case. The former LT got himself into that mess, because HE disobeyed a LAWFUL order.

That was the ENTIRE case, AND HE ADMITS to doing that in SEVERAL of his OWN videos that he posted to his website and on YouTube. HIS DOG BITE lawyer (yes Hemenway was a lawyer who often took on Dog bite injuries) was in no way giving him any sound advice and had absolutely zero experience in Military laws and the UCMJ.

He admitted guilt before millions of people.

He had no defense. And the orders he disobeyed caused another doctor to fill his place with no time to get ready for it. The doctor who replaced him, told on the stand that the situation that he experienced was dire (he arrived around a time when an attack happened and many soldiers were injured) and since he wasn't adequately prepared for his duty, found that he could not peform at 100%. That a lot of lives were at risk because he was not prepared.

And in addition to not being prepared, HIS family was not prepared for him to leave.

Lt. Lakin dug his hole. He deserves to live in it.
 
 
 
What is "the role of the press"?

 
To investigate and report stories they find intriguing or the public needs to know.

Not to placate the whims of a few whiny and insane conspiracy theorists who have no concept of the laws, the US Constitution (of which they claim to defend) and bigots/racists.
 
 
 
What is "the role of the press"?

 
To get close enough to President Obama to pull off his latex mask and expose him as Old Man Jenkins, the amusement park custodian? Ruh-roh!

.........................

ETA: would it have been funnier to say "the Kenyan amusement park custodian"?
 
 
 
Perhaps this little dog and pony thread was a JREF  People's Court  of evidentiary discovery and examination to your kangaroo court satisfaction, but I happen to think the United States of America deserves a little better than this.

 
OK, I can say without fail that Obama is African American.

Norm
 
 
 
I support Corsair asserting that any member of the press ask whoever he/they feel is most appropriate to ask and also starting a thread to make his significant point that needs making...

 

And you yet again evade answering a point which, on purely logical grounds, demolishes your conspiracy theory. (And fullflavormenthol's point about Democratic rivals for the Presidential nomination is well taken, adding yet another point which disproves, on logical grounds alone, the 'birther' nonsense.)

Never mind the fact you have no evidence to offer which disproves the validity of the existing documents.

You have nothing for your case but absolute intellectual emptiness.
 
 
 
Thought I'd help you emphasize a bit more.

ASK OBAMA. ?!

 
OK, let's see just precisely how stupid this idea is.

Jude Brando, fearless investigative reporter, decides to beard the lion in his den. Obtaining a White House press pass, he decides to stand up and be the one American hero to actually ask the question none dare voice. At a Presidential press conference, the scene plays out something like this.

President Obama: Thank you, Gentlemen, that concludes the main business of the day. Does anyone have any further questions?

Jude Brando (for it is he!): Yes, Mr. President. Can you confirm that you are a natural born Americal citizen?

PO (smiling): Yes, sir, I can confirm that I am an American citizen, and proud to be one.

JB: But, sir, would you please tell us where you were born?

PO: I was born in Honolulu, Hawaii.

JB: And is it your testimony, sir, that you personally recollect that fact?

PO: No, like all newborn babies I was too young at the time to recall the memories of that event.

JB: So your claim is based on what, exactly?

PO: On the testimony of my mother, the Certificate of Live Birth issued by the State of Hawaii, and the birth announcement in the newspaper.

So, fearless investigative reporter Jude Brando, where exactly has that got you?

Dave
 
 
 
So, fearless investigative reporter Jude Brando, where exactly has that got you?

 
Into the White House, which is more than I'll ever be likely to accomplish -- us foreigners have to book White House tours through our embassy, but mine doesn't bother serving groups smaller than 15 and I always travel in a group of 2 (my wife + I).  
 
 
 
A reference = "poster child"?

"Use"?

He is crushed.

 
No kidding.

LTC Lakin (probably soon to be former LTC Lakin) predicated his actions based on the fact that he seemed to believe his orders came from the President. They did not; they came from his immediate superior officer on behalf of the Department of Defense. He has admitted this fact. He has pleaded guilty to the charges against him and will likely receive, at the very least, an other than honorable discharge or, at worst, a dismissal from military service as well as serving some time in prison for his crimes. You want to use him as shining example of something, be my guest, but speaking as a member of the military, LTC Lakin is little better than a traitor.

The thing you seem to not be understanding is that there are approximately 80 or more cases that have been brought against President Obama or the state of Hawaii demanding that the person in question be granted irrefutable proof of the president's citizenship; most have been linked to in the other thread Arus provided a link to earlier in this thread. Every single one has been thrown out due to a COMPLETE lack of evidence of any wrongdoing on the part of the President, the governmental bodies responsible for ensuring the eligibility of the persons running for office, and the State of Hawaii; most have been dismissed WITH prejudice, essentially telling the person that if they try to pursue the issue, there will be sanctions brought against them for wasting the court's time. One person (Orly Taitz) has already been fined $20,000 for wasting the court's time with this nonsense, a decision that has been held up by every appeals court all the way to the Supreme Court of the United States, IIRC. The reason for that is that, according to the LAW, the President has provided every item necessary to prove his citizenship, and has in fact shown MORE than he needs to, since he didn't HAVE to allow his birth certificate to be shown to the rank and file of the American people; all he needed to provide it to was the bodies responsible for certifying his eligibility to run for the office. So your incredulity or personal opinion on the matter is utterly moot at this point; evidence has been provided that meets all legal standards and laws proving the President's citizenship, and quite frankly nothing more need be said.
 
 
On the Daily Show last night Jon Stewart touched on the subject. The bit was that IBM created a computer that could run as the Republican candidate for President in 2012 (since there is no clear front-runner). The computer questioned Obama's citizenship and Stewart mentioned that there is documents that prove (besides the CLB) that his parents were married in Feb 1961 when his mothere was pregnant with him. The marriage certiicate is in Hawaii. He then asked the computer if he is saying that a fetus is not a human being. It then chrashed due to the paradox.
 
 
 
just one prominent person in the press with access to the president asked him a simple and clear question. Not done even once in the entire campaign and not once in more than two years in office... and none of you critical-thinkers are skeptical...

 
Because there is no issue here, except the one birthers manufacture in their heads.

 
Thought I'd help you emphasize a bit more.

ASK OBAMA. ?!

 
'Ask Obama'? But you have said repeatedly it wouldn't matter what Obama replied with, it wouldn't be enough to convince you.

 
Did you ever notice that everyone that has a question that gets passed over thinks it's because their question is so overwhelmingly incisive and compelling? No one ever says, hmmm, maybe it was dumb and that's why. Quote and respond to 47 out of 50 and 2 out of the other 3 will say something like "Yeah, how come you didn't answer my question? What's the matter, huh? Yeah, I thought so, run away, huh?"

 
You misunderstand my intentions. I was offering you a way out of this thread with a small shred of dignity. You could have replied with "Yeah, I see some excellent evidence here and my support for the question of Obama's foreign birth has been obliterated. Thanks for shining some light on the matter for me!" I never implied you were running away from the question I asked; perhaps you simply didn't see my question. Now that I know you saw it, there is no excuse for you not to answer it (and no, it isn't a 'stupid' question; it's just one that makes you uncomfortable). Now you are evading the question completely.

I'll ask again.

JudeBrando, with the excellent, verifiable information in this thread and a preponderance of the evidence shown, and the thorough debunking of the arguments you posted, do you now accept that Obama was born in the US?

Is the matter settled for you? If not, why?
 
 
Clearly, that's one of the "stupid questions".

I maintain he's not interested in settling the matter... only maintaining doubt of Obama's legitimacy regardless of the facts.
 
 
 
JudeBrando, with the excellent, verifiable information in this thread and a preponderance of the evidence shown, and the thorough debunking of the arguments you posted, do you now accept that Obama was born in the US?

A most excellent and ignored question, with the failure to respond leading to the conclusion of a): a complete troll (and thus unworthy of further engagement) or b) a complete idiot of the "the earth is flat" variety incapable of not only answering questions but of any openess to facts that contradict his starting premise.
 
 
 
OK, let's see just precisely how stupid this idea is.

Jude Brando, fearless investigative reporter, decides to beard the lion in his den. Obtaining a White House press pass, he decides to stand up and be the one American hero to actually ask the question none dare voice. At a Presidential press conference, the scene plays out something like this.

[SNIP]

 
No, no, no. That is a completely unrealistic portrayal of events. It would happen much more like this:

President Obama: Thank you, Gentlemen, that concludes the main business of the day. Does anyone have any further questions?

Jude Brando: Yes, Mr. President. Can you confirm that you are a natural born Americal citizen?

PO: I, uh, think that issue has been resolved.

JB: Sir! Can you, on the record, confirm that you are a natural born American citizen?

PO: Uh, well, I think that we're out of time here so...

JB: President Obama sir, please answer the question!

PO: CURSE YOU, FEARLESS INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER JUDE BRANDO! MAY MY HEATHEN GOD DEVOUR YOUR SOUL AS IT SHALL ALL OF AMERICA!

JB: Wait, I... hold on. I think that still wasn't technically an answer.
 
 
Here you go, JB:

 
President Obama joked about the ongoing "birther" debate surrounding his birthplace at a Democratic fundraiser in Boston Tuesday night.

"I think there's nothing – there's no weakness in us trying to reach out and seeing if we can find common ground. Now, there are going to be times where we can't," Obama said about reaching across the aisle. "I was born in Hawaii, what can I say? I mean, I just… I can't change those facts."

 
 http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com...hplace-rumors/ 
 
 
 
Here you go, JB:

 

Ahhh, but that wasn't coaxed out of him by a professional, national reporter, so... doesn't count.  
 
 
And it wasn't under supeana and thus liable to a charge of purjery, unlike the certification of the CLB by Hawaii... oddly, no one I know is arguing that the state officials in Hawaii who are cooperating in this fraud should be taken to court or cited for their help in abbetting this crime and their overt act of purjery for "certifying" a clearly false document.
 
 
And, besides, you know he'd do anything to pander to a democratic party audience, unlike what he would say if he were asked that in a White House presser.
 
 
Again, which is more stupid:
- a "birther" thinking we believe he'd be satisfied if the question was asked just the right way - even if the answer was still "Hawaii"?
-or-
- a "birther" who actually believes that asking the question just the right way would force an answer that would blow open the whole giant conspiracy?

I mean, they're both so stupid, you have to squint, so it's hard to judge.
 
 
 
Thought I'd help you emphasize a bit more.

ASK OBAMA. ?!

 
Do you think you prove anything with the overuse of ellipses?

Anywho, we have already established that it wouldn't matter to you what President Obama said, and it doesn't matter because the evidence for his citizenship is already there.

You would be able to find it, but you are too busy placing ellipses all over the place.

 
...I've...toss around "the N Word" with impunity,...Could there be a coincidence or correlation there?

Did you ever notice that everyone that has a question that gets passed over... is so overwhelmingly incisive and compelling? No one ever says... it was dumb... I... run away, huh?"
...this...  People's Court ...I happen to think the United States of America deserves...this.

 
 
 
Oh dear.... Obama confesses:

"I was born in Hawaii"

 http://content.usatoday.com/communit...-those-facts/1 

I guess that completes the thread huh? No need for a reporter to ask the question now.

Oh let me try...

Oh...I guess it is legitimate.
 
 
 
Jude, Saggy, can one or both of you explain what you find insufficient about the birth certificate that has been released?

 
It does not saY "Born in Kenya"

Norm
 
 
JudeBrando and Saggy have convinced me.

Why can't the rest of you be open minded to the possibility that a very large series of unlikely actions by a large number of unconnected people led to the complete obfuscation of Obama's true birthplace with no mistakes or slip-ups whatsoever that would look identical to Obama having ben born in Hawaii? I mean, it's possible, right? And if it's possible, then Obama has an obligation to answer the simple question of where he was born. However, verbal confirmation that he was born in Hawaii is possibly a lie.

I'm not sure what the next step in this chain of logic is, but Obama better just step down and let McCain be president until we get this sorted out. Which we won't, because there will always be a possibility that a very large series of unlikely actions by a large number of unconnected people led to the complete obfuscation of Obama's true birthplace with no mistakes or slip-ups whatsoever that would look identical to Obama having been born in Hawaii.

Anyway, the point is: you closed minded sheeple make me sick!

Yeah, I saw that last night too.

Now, we have a statement on the record that is more specific than any other previously.

The press should go home now.
 
 
JudeBrando,
Why are you ignoring this challenge?

 
show me any single individual with more evidence for their American birth than Obama. Here's what I will need you to show me:

1. A birth certificate.
2. A newspaper clipping that highlights the birth.
3. Records proving that the mother was present in America at the time of birth.
4. Investigations from multiple fact-checking organizations that have held the documents with their own hands to verify that they exist and are authentic.
5. A press release by at least two officials within the state of birth, verifying that the records are on file.

 
 
 
 
Yeah, I saw that last night too.

Now, we have a statement on the record that is more specific than any other previously.

The press should go home now.

 
SO, now you don't believe it is an issue? Now, you are convinced that Obama was born in the U.S.? or, Now, you believe the press would be foolish to ask a question like you posed in the O.P.?
 
 
 
SO, now you don't believe it is an issue? Now, you are convinced that Obama was born in the U.S.? or, Now, you believe the press would be foolish to ask a question like you posed in the O.P.?

 
More likely, he's being sarcastic. As if any one person's statement is evidence of anything.

Frankly, Obama's testimony, even if it had been under oath in a court of law, would not have been authoritative. Who remembers their own birth and details like who, where, and when? We were each of us told where and when we are born. He would have only been repeating what he had always been told.

His Hawaii-issued birth certificate is much more authoritative and credible (and conclusive). The fact that his birth certificate and Obama agree on the details is merely confirmation of consistency.

The press not only should have gone home years ago on this issue, they did go home. There is genuinely nothing to see here. Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
 
 
I suspect you are correct...I'm often deaf to sarcasm on line... leads one to wonder, however, what part of "I was born in Hawaii..." is confusing, disengenuous, wrong or difficult to understand...

I think it got buried here or in another thread--can someone point me to the WND article arguing against birtherism (during their hate-on-Hillary days?)

Is the matter settled for you? If not, why?

 

Please answer the question.
 
 
He can't because he's trying to pretend that he is the reasonable skeptic only seeking truth while the rest of us participating are blind, or worse knowingly refusing to aknowledge his simple request for "proof" from Obama. To answer your question would clearly expose the fact that he isn't objective, reasonable, unbiased or even skeptical, rather easilly classified as at best gulible and credulous or, at worst, a complete loon unable to grasp reality.

Jude, Saggy, can one or both of you explain what you find insufficient about the birth certificate that has been released?

 
I think he'd take the JAQ gambit here: that "there are just too many unanswered questions about the details of his birth." Nice and vague, not really making any claims.

 
Yeah, I saw that last night too.

Now, we have a statement on the record that is more specific than any other previously.

The press should go home now.

 
Now that the only newsworthy item in existence has been put to rest, I guess the press has nothing left to cover.

Earlier in the thread he responded with words to the effect of "you won't believe the flaws anyway so I am not going to waste my time listing them."
 
 
I always come back to the most basic question underpinning all of this: Why, in the name of God, would Obama have been born anywhere else? Why would his mother have left the safety and familiarity of the United States while pregnant? Why go half way around the world to give birth? Why cover it up way back then?

Was it just so she could screw with people's heads a half century later?

 Jon Stewart revealed the scheme  almost 2 years ago (it starts from about 5:30 into that clip).
 
 
He had to be born in Kenya so he could undergo the secrete Mau Mau initiation rite, involving the blood sacrifice of a colonial Brit committed on an American flag under a picture of Lenin dressed as Osama Bin Ladin. Its the only place they do it that way, the Honolulu version, for example, hasn't used a colonial Brit since Capt. Cook waded ashore all those years ago.
 
 
Let us suppose that we never did get any proof in the form or the certified copy of the COLB.

What do we still know?

We know that Ann got pregnant in Hawaii. We know that young Obama was raised there. We know that there is no reason for her to have left to give birth elsewhere. We know that there is no evidence of a birth taking place elsewhere.
As such logic leads us to conclude that he was born there even if no direct evidence was ever provided of the birth. And a claim otherwise is going to have to surmount those bits of knowledge listed above.

You left out that Obama's Father worked for Karen Blixen............Gotta get an "Out Of Africa" reference in there somewhere.......
 
 
I'm convinced Obama's mother went to Africa because she wanted to bless the rains.

(The "fact" that Hawaii is one of the rainiest places on earth obviously is a lie. The NWO created this lie to discredit my astounding piece of evidence.)
 
 
Obama to party with Washington reporters

 Sat Mar 12, 5:09 am ET

WASHINGTON  President Barack Obama will speak at the 126th annual Gridiron Club dinner in Washington on Saturday evening.

The white-tie event is an opportunity for journalists to poke fun at public figures and political themes of the day..

This will be the first time Obama has appeared at the event. Last year, former President Bill Clinton stood in for the president who was preparing for a probable House vote on health care reform.

 http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110312/...bama_preview_1 
 
 
Yes, if any mention of the birther thing is made there it will be purely to poke fun at the idiocy of it.

 Birther Bill Author Would Require 'Long-Form Birth Certificate' But Can't Say What That Means 

 
Last month, Tennessee state Sen. Mae Beavers introduced SB 1091, a bill that would require presidential candidates to present a long-form birth certificate in order to qualify for the ballot in the Volunteer State.
...
It's a far-fetched goal, and it turns out that Beavers, who recently discussed her bill on Reality Check, a radio show devoted to debunking birther legislation, still has some research to do. From the transcript:
RC: What are the specific requirements in the bill?

MB: That they have to have the long form birth certificate.

RC: What is the long form birth certificate?

MB: Now, you're asking me to get into a lot of things that I haven't really looked into yet....
Beavers went on to state more clearly, "I'm not entirely sure what long form means." She seemed genuinely surprised by the news that not all states even print long-form birth certificates anymore. "I only know about Tennessee," she explained.

I'll ask again.

JudeBrando, with the excellent, verifiable information in this thread and a preponderance of the evidence shown, and the thorough debunking of the arguments you posted, do you now accept that Obama was born in the US?

Is the matter settled for you? If not, why?

 

What say you, JB?
 
 
I'm sure there was a question I wanted to ask...
 
Jude, Saggy, can one or both of you explain what you find insufficient about the birth certificate that has been released?

Bwahaha, well played mr. President.

 
President Obama got the Marine Band to give him a special musical introduction at the Gridiron Club's annual dinner on Saturday night. After the traditional “Hail to the Chief,” Gunnery Sgt. Kevin Bennear sprang to the stage and as the band struck up the familiar chords of Bruce Springsteen’s anthem, belted out:

“Born in the U-S-A! Born in the U-S-A!”

“Some things just bear repeating,” said Obama, as an audience of more than 600 government officials and media executives broke up at the allusion to the long-running rumors over the president’s birth certificate.

Nicely done.
 
 
The Donald goes there...

 
Donald Trump got a little bit birther-curious in his interview with ABC News, saying of President Obama's time growing up in Hawaii: "The reason I have a little doubt, just a little, is because he grew up and nobody knew him."

Role ? No.

Maybe they're mocking him because his position on the topic is as ridiculous as his bad comb-over. Maybe they're mocking him for the same reasons you found yourself getting mowed down with your silly arguments here in this thread. It's the same reason you refuse to answer my question (asked 4 times now).

You don't want to accept anything that contradicts your birther idea.

BINGO!

It's obvious to me that all this hoopla from birthers isn't really about his birth certificate.

Incidentally, now you are starting to sound like the Truthers and their "The Official Story". You even have the same distain for those who point out that it not only matches the facts, but is the only version that makes any sense.

I anticipate the word "sheeple" making it's debute in this thread.
 
 
 
BINGO!

It's obvious to me that all this hoopla from birthers isn't really about his birth certificate.

 
Unfortunately when you point out that fact you get accused of bringing up the "race card" which I have come to refer to as the reverse race card maneuver, basically bringing up the idea of the "race card" as a means to shut down any legitimate discussion or observation of racial bias in the subject(s) being debated.

The reason to mock Trump is that he released a document that he referred to as his official birth certificate and it turned out to not be an official birth certificate.
 
 
 
The only thing he does not ignore, and the only thing that appears to matter to him, is that Obama is not "white."

Oh yes the classic "reverse race card maneuver", i know it well. Handwaving away racism by degenerating it into a card game which is a pathetic attempt to claim that racism is a false accusation that is wildly used for no reason.  

Their weak little "card" tricks don't work with me. Racists somehow think it covers their tracks, but it just exposes them even moreso in my eyes. I think it's very funny how some of many of todays racists are in the "closet" about it. Running for cover whenever they are called on their racism. It's a little bit of poetic justice.

I'd love to see a birther give a good reason they didn't play their games, until we had a president that isn't caucasian.

They can't, and what is funny is the lengths they they go through to cover it. This usually goes into the De Vattel territory, which is debunked by the fact the the founders would not have not access to his works until after the Constitution itself was written. The "Law of Nations" section they like to point too was way before and had nothing to do with the obscure reference they think it deals with.

Still it is funny, because not since the Apollo or Holocaust hoax believers have I not found a CT that was so easy to debunk, and yet deal with one that was so believed in by the deniers.

Yes, it is. It is the role of the press to point out that Trump is 'regurgitating' an idiotic conspiracy theory that contradicts all the evidence, and that the answer to the nearest thing to an honest equivalent to the complex question he is asking was widely disseminated to the public over two years ago. And it's equally the role of the press to point out that Trump, along with everybody else who refuses to stop questioning the President's eligibility despite the fact that it has already been established beyond a shadow of reasonable doubt, is motivated at least in part by simple, tawdry, despicable and familiar racism.

I can't go that far as it seems to be poisoning the well. I feel it's sufficient to point out that the claims are factually incorrect, without asserting the motives of those saying them, even if conclusions seem easy.

Personally I think hyper-partisanship is as much to blame as racism among a lot of the "doubters". It is a claim that opposes Obama's presidency, they oppose Obama's presidency, therefore they give it special attention. But I don't think motive can be generalized as objective fact.

I don't like assuming people have a dishonest reason to believe something just because they won't accept what seems to me the obvious truth. It goes both ways... I wouldn't want to be assumed insincere just because I disagreed with popular wisdom.

I think I agree on the question of motivations for birtherism and, frankly, it doesn't matter why someone chooses to think this is still a valid question.

What I disagree with is the idea that this issue comes down to a matter of subjective truth. The facts of the case dictate a vanishingly small likelihood that Obama's birth was anything other than he claims it to be. (I mean, it's possible that Hitler riding atop a time-traveling dinosaur kidnapped Obama's mom brought her to Kenya for the day or so necessary to birth Obama, immediately brought her back to Hawaii, and then faked all the evidence necessary to make it appear that nothing unusual happend, but it isn't very likely.)

You say that as if hyper-partisanship was an honest reason.

If someone is honest, they will look at the evidence as it is. They will NOT continously ignore all the evidence that contradicts their claims, and they will not desperately dredge the depths of the internet to turn up tiny shreds of irrelevant nonsense that they agree with. But, since that is the way creationists, truthers, Holocaust deniers and Birthers operate, they are not honest.

As state-controlled as this forum. But I've already said too much...
 
 
 
The "Law of Nations" section they like to point too was way before and had nothing to do with the obscure reference they think it deals with.

 
and the funny part is that in that book, the chapter on CITIZENSHIP as discussed by Vattel was only examples that he ran across. He even states and uses England in his writings on how citizenship is earned by being born on the soil of that country.

birthers fail at reading
birthers fail at READING for comprehension

It isn't an honest reason, it's just a reason other than racism. I'm pointing out that trying to decide why someone believes or fails to believe something is kind of slippery, and it isn't appropriate to presume the motive of a specific individual without evidence--and by that I mean evidence pertaining to that specific individual, not just that there's a pattern in other people who believed it or came up with it.

Absent specific evidence, that it's their honestly held belief cannot be ruled out.

I think motivation can partially be inferred from the solution that particular birthers suggest. If they say that because of Obama's ineligibility, Biden should be president, then it is probably not hyper-partisanship and instead is racism. If they say that because of Obama's ineligibility, McCain should be president (or that we should have a "do over") it could be hyper-partisanship, racism, or a combination of the two.

How many have got as far as proposing a solution to this "problem"?

Dude, unclench.

The issue isn't that you disagree with anyone. The issue is that you are rejecting solid evidence without giving any real reason to do so. At least, no reason that holds up under scrutiny.

"A lot of people are still questioning..." is not a good reason. Fake documentation that contradicts that provided by the President is not a good reason. We can go into the particulars of why this is the case, but it isn't that Birthers are "evil liars".

Birthers get saddled with poor reputations because they tend toward conspiracy theories that either doesn't pass the Ocaam's Razor test or simply doesn't agree with the evidence. You, yourself, posted several pieces of evidence that turned out to be completely fraudulent. The "Welcome To Kenya" sign, for example.

So, really, if Birthers want to be taken seriously after a long string of bad arguments they need to do the following: (1) provide a reasonable explanation for what they believed happen that accounts for the available evidence and (2) provide evidence (the real thing, not photoshopped garbage) that this explanation is correct while the more straightforward explanation of Obama being born in Hawaii is not.
 
 
And back to the OP, it is not the Press's role to cater to any off-the-wall alternate theory. That being said, the story did run its newcycle and then died the death it deserved. There is no story there to go after.

A bonus would be (3) express some kind of contrition or embarrassment for uncritically swallowing such frauds, forgeries, and fallacies in the first place, and maybe question the motives of those who sold you those lies.

Hello, zombie thread!

Since last I saw this thread, even more (yet unnecessary) evidence has come to light that reinforces that the Press were in the right to not dignify this nonsense with any more attention than it deserved.

Well, JudeBrando? Do you have anything to add?
 
 
I expect he's splitting his time between this issue and that of George W. Bush's unexplained disappearance whilst serving in the Texas Air National Guard.

No? Really? Gosh, Mr. Brando seemed so non-partisan.
 
 
Heck, since this thread came out, the President had to make a special request of Hawaii to release his long form BC, which, if I recall correctly, is what Jude wanted... so how about it, Jude? Are your doubts now cleared up?

Oh wait... wow... those goalposts are just SHOOTING away...
 
 
Fox Business Network's Eric Bolling is keeping up the media presense on this issue.

 
BOLLING: I just have tell you for purposefully, we didn't touch it because we didn't think it was an issue until I saw this document. When I saw the green border, the Photoshop border around the birth certificate, I said wait a minute.

This thing isn't a pure copy from a book, a ledger from Hawaii. This thing has been altered. Someone's playing with it. Once that came out, I said we have to at least ask the question Juan.That's all. We're not claiming it is illlegit whatever, but someone is playing around with this document.

There's a Fox Newscaster born every minute.
 
 
And they're all paid better than I. Man, I need to ramp up the crazy-stupid if I want to get anywhere.
 
 
I really hate bringing this up again, but the firearms forum I'm on is going nuts over  Orly's latest filing. 

The only bright side is I've really pegged who to add to my ignore list, but I'm wondering what the deal is with the claim that Orly's looking to gain access to Obama's SSN paperwork?
 
 
The best summary you can read on the whole SSN issue is here:
 http://www.thefogbow.com/special-rep...curity-number/ 

It contains the history of Orly's filings (needs to be updated with the current FOIA case she has against the SSA), but addresses all the craziness she's spouting.

In short: Orly believes that Obama is fraudulently using 39 SSN's.

to follow her current case against the SSA, you can read through this thread:
 http://www.thefogbow.com/forum/viewt...hp?f=24&t=5421 
 
 
The SSA hit a return volley, asking the court to strike all of Orly's filings containing non-redacted SS# from the court record.

 http://www.scribd.com/doc/60475492/T...cd-146770-24-0 
 
 
Orly got sanctioned again...to the tune of...damn only $250

JudeBrando, how did you ever find any of these people even remotely credible? This story got more attention from than it deserved before the election. Anything it got since the first time Obama presented his perfectly legal and accurate birth certificate was merely to get some quick page views from, or sell a book to, the gullible conspiracy theorists who couldn't think for themselves enough to come up with the obvious conclusion.
