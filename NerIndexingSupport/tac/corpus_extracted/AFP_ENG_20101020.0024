US aerospace giant Boeing stands to make up to 24 billion dollars from the sale
of aircraft and helicopters to Saudi Arabia that the US government approved
Wednesday, the company said.

"Boeing is pleased that the US government has formally notified Congress of its
intent to sell F-15s, Apaches and AH-6i to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia," the
group said in a statement to AFP by email.

The total earnings for the sale of its products "is anticipated to be
approximately 24 billion dollars" over the lifetime of the program and a yearly
earning of 4.6 billion dollars, Boeing said.

Some 77,000 Boeing employees and contractors are to work on the project.

"We look forward to working with the US government and the Kingdom of Saudi
Arabia on these programs, which are designed to strengthen security in the
region," it added.

The plan announced Wednesday allows for the sale of 84 F-15 fighter jets, 70
Apache attack helicopters, 72 tactical Black Hawk helicopters and 36 light
helicopters, US officials said.

The delivery of the weapons to oil-rich Saudi Arabia would be spread over 15 to
20 years.

US defense officials said the deal had been in the works for months with the
Saudis, who have grown increasingly anxious about Iran's missile arsenal.
