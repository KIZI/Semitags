Shortly before Easter in 2008, Antoine Maalouf arrived at the offices of the
Greek tourism minister with an unusual request: He wanted to buy an island.

The general director of the Monaco-based investment company MMC Group slid $21
billion, in the form of guarantees issued by some of the largest financial
institutions in the United States and Europe, across the mahogany conference
table, right under the minister's nose.

Maalouf's idea was simple. His investor group would pay $167 million for
Patroklos Island -- a barren 1,000-acre strip in the Saronic Gulf nicknamed
"Donkey Island" by fishermen -- and use the remaining funds to construct a Las
Vegas-style theme park.

The island is a short boat ride from Athens, and Maalouf, 63, planned to pack it
with casinos, golf courses, luxury accommodations for 50,000 people, and a
marina for thousands of yachts. The project would employ 8,000 Greeks at a time
when the country was hurting for jobs. Donatella Versace had signed on to build
a luxury hotel.

"All I needed to start was a letter that promised government assistance in
overcoming Greece's ridiculous bureaucracy," Maalouf says. "I wanted commitment,
an official written commitment."

In response, Maalouf claims, then-Tourism Minister Fani Palli-Petralia said that
"the Greek government gives you its full support," and, "you have our blessing."

"So, you will give me the letter?" Maalouf repeated.

"What?" Palli-Petralia asked him. "You don't trust the government of Greece?"

Maalouf says he never got his letter, and his Donkey Island development project
died, a victim of the kind of bureaucratic paralysis and institutionalized
corruption that Prime Minister George Papandreou is now struggling to bring
under control. Greece may owe its creditors $557 billion by 2012, following a
bailout of the Greek economy by the European Union and International Monetary
Fund earlier this year.

Confronted with monthly debt payments of $6 billion, Papandreou, while at the
January 2010 gathering of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland,
suggested a strategy that ailing companies often pursue when fighting for
survival: selling prized assets. The most valuable treasures that Greece has to
offer are its 6,000 sun-soaked islands, which, along with luxury properties and
other land the government controls, might fetch a healthy premium on the open
market.

Most of Greece's islands are in private hands, and are valued at $4 million to
$209 million. While the government doesn't own them, it benefits from the sales
through tax revenue and development, which creates jobs and attracts tourists.
As a result, the state is involved in all aspects of any transaction, from
authorizing a deal to regulating every detail of who might buy a property and
how much they will pay. This puts consenting adults at the mercy of the Greek
bureaucracy.

Although no sales have taken place since Papandreou floated the idea, the
possibilities are immense. The Ionian Sea boasts Skorpios, the legendary
compound of Aristotle Onassis. To the east, lie the islands of Spetsopoula,
owned by the Niarchos family, and Koronida, the retreat of the Livanos clan. The
list goes on. The trouble is that the labyrinthine federal, state, local,
military and religious regulations, decrees, laws, proclamations and edicts have
made it almost impossible for anyone to sell anything, because no one can agree
on who owns what.

Greece isn't the only modern nation that has faced calamitous budget shortfalls
and needed to sell state-controlled land and other assets to keep creditors
away. Between 1993 and 1995, for example, 20,000 of Russia's 27,000 state
enterprises were sold for about 10 percent of their value to raise capital,
according to Kremlinologist Boris Kagarlitsky, director of the Institute of
Globalization Studies and Social Movements in Moscow.

"Greek islands cultivate more curiosity from foreign investors than discussing
our debt-to-GDP ratio with a guy who wants to build a chain of shopping malls
with tax breaks on tendered government land," says Mike Vassiliou, director of
the Greek real-estate company NAI Global, who serves as an adviser to the
permanent International Monetary Fund monitors scrutinizing plans to sell or
lease state-owned properties to service creditors. What he means is that
offering islands might lure all sorts of buyers who could end up making badly
needed investments in Greece.

"But the government so far refuses to create boutique offerings that attract
entrepreneurs and private investors," Vassiliou says. "If you come in with 200
million euros to invest, the government claims it will help you cut through the
bureaucracy. A penny less and you're on your own in the labyrinth."

Even with Papandreou's enthusiasm, actually buying a Greek island is maddeningly
difficult. Prospective purchasers often spend more time and money negotiating
the ultimate sale price with government bureaucrats than with the property's
actual owner. Then there's the challenge of trying to figure out who really owns
the land.

"Right now there are court battles over land disputes that stretch back to
1838," says former Secretary-General of the Greek Ministry of Economy Stratis
Stratigis, who once headed the Athens Olympic Organizing Committee and served as
legal counsel to Maalouf's bid for Patroklos. "We still don't have a land
registry."

The EU gave Greece almost $84 million to create a land-record office in 1994.
But, according to Petros Doukas, a former deputy finance and deputy foreign
minister, "the EU demanded some of its grants back. The cost of creating the
registry somehow escalated from 1,300 euros ($1,800) per square kilometer to
30,000 ($42,000) euros per square kilometer."

An independent study undertaken by Vassiliou earlier this year is perhaps the
closest thing Greece has to an official land registry. Scouring the country's
court records, Vassiliou says he discovered that the state is currently
disputing 675,000 acres of land claimed by individuals. The Greek Orthodox
Church is wrangling in the courts over its ownership of a further 325,000 acres.
Stratigis calls the crisis one of basic arithmetic. "Greek governments," he
says, "never learned how to count."

The Papandreou administration hired George Papaioannou, the chief executive
officer of Piraeus Real Estate, a unit of Piraeus Bank SA, to assess, value and
dispose of government-owned real estate by sale or lease and bring order to the
island transactions. His team has 50 properties to dispose of throughout the
country.

"I'm one of the coaches, the man who's telling the government what they have and
how to best sell it," Papaioannou says. "Don't ask me how many acres we have,
because nobody really knows."

Papaioannou's calculations indicate the government has $418 billion worth of
land available for sale. History's last recorded state land sale of such scope
was the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, when Napoleon sold 828,000 square miles of
North American land inhabited by 74,556 people to the U.S. for $15 million. Like
Greece today, France was in desperate need of cash to pay its debts. President
Thomas Jefferson shipped Napoleon $3 million in gold bullion and let the emperor
finance the rest through bonds issued by Baring & Co. in London and English and
Dutch investment houses.

"If you put (300 billion euros) on the creditors' table, it will cover the
fiscal problem," Papaioannou says. "But it's up to the government to decide. The
biggest problem I face is the bureaucracy. Maybe it's time to slap them in the
face."

Renee Pappas, a former adviser to Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Theodore
Kassimis and Deputy Finance Minister Doukas, is a founding member of Foreign
Investors in Greek Development, a private group whose mandate is to attract
foreign capital and guide small businesses through the alien bureaucracy.

Over the past eight years, she says, her organization has seen investors
wielding $139 million of potential investment capital from South Africa,
Switzerland, Belgium, and Australia give up and leave the negotiating table.
"Greece is an immature country of bickering children and, like all children,
they need a guardian," Pappas says. "Foreign investors interested in state land
won't put up with the bribes and political pressures."

In 2004, former Defense Minister Spelios Spilitopoulos sensed that Greece might
be heading for financial disaster, and decided to calculate the value of the
real estate his ministry held in a bewildering portfolio dating back to the late
19th century. The report, Ministry of Defense Evaluation and Survey of Land, was
delivered in 2007.

The report listed among its 2,500 properties, 30 acres of land on the island of
Mykonos with an ocean view, valued at $697 million; a few hundred acres of
beachfront property south of Athens near the Temple of Poseidon, undervalued at
$139 million because squatters had taken over most of the land; and a 5,000
-square-foot penthouse apartment on Queen Sophia Street in Athens valued at $11
million, which was rented to a bureaucrat for $277 a month.

Much of the land that the Defense Ministry accumulated over the years was willed
to the military by families who wanted to help fight the Turks. These "patriotic
donations" continue to this day, and, according to Stratigis, notaries public
and attorneys are legally obligated to ask their clients how much they plan on
giving to the military in their final wills and testaments.

At the same time, Spilitopoulos says, various groups within the defense and
other ministries attempted to thwart his investigation in the hopes of
leveraging the confusion to wrest property from his oversight and control. The
assets of the Greek army, for instance, are maintained by the Finance Ministry
rather than Defense.

Spilitopoulos, who resigned under pressure in 2006, says that the report has
been ignored and that the fight over who owns what won't end any time soon.
