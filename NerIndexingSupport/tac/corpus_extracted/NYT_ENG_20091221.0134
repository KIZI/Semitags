Oscar Eugene Richardson has a knack for two things: getting out
of jail and disappearing from the law.

He did it in 1979, when the convicted armed robber escaped from
a work release center and wasn't seen again for 30 years.

Not until Saturday, that is, when the U.S. Marshals caught him
living under an alias in Missouri and arrested him.

Yet Richardson is a free man once again.

Despite spending three decades on the run from Florida
authorities, a Missouri judge on Monday set bail of $25,000 for the
fugitive  ignoring the protests of the local prosecutor.

The 61-year-old Richardson, who has lived in Missouri under the
name of Eugene Ward all these years, was released on bail from the
Taney County jail that afternoon.

His next court date is Feb. 11. Will Richardson be there?

"Yes, of course he will," said his Missouri attorney, Dee
Wampler.

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement touted Richardson's
capture at a news conference Monday as the first win for its "12
Days of Fugitives" hotline, a Christmas-themed effort to nab
violent escapees who have been on the run the longest.

Later that day, an Associated Press reporter told FDLE that
Richardson had slipped away once again. The agency's head was left
fuming.

"I am shocked and extremely disappointed by the irresponsible
decision of Judge Tony Williams to allow Oscar Richardson to post
bond," said FDLE Commissioner Gerald M. Bailey in a prepared
statement. "Richardson is a violent felony offender who was
serving time in Florida for an armed robbery conviction when he
fled after serving only a fraction of his sentence.

"Allowing this fugitive to walk out of a courtroom after hiding
from authorities for 30 years diminishes the seriousness of his
crimes and shows a lack of sensitivity for those he victimized and
a disregard for the safety of the citizens of Taney County."

Richardson landed in prison because of two armed robberies he
committed in Tampa in 1977. That January, he held two drugstore
employees at gunpoint and demanded money. Then in March he robbed a
Tampa convenience store at gunpoint.

He was less than two years into a 10-year sentence when he
escaped from the Kissimmee Work Release Center in 1979.

Shortly after his escape, an FDLE agent told the Associated
Press, Richardson made his way to Missouri.

He used a false Social Security number and became Eugene Ward.
He spent 26 years in the same house, had a long-term relationship
and fathered a child. Then Saturday, federal agents found him in
Ridgedale, Mo., near the Arkansas state line.

Richardson was stunned. So was his girlfriend.

"?'It's not me. How did you find me? Who told you?'?" is what
Richardson wanted to know, FDLE Special Agent Jim Madden told the
Associated Press. "Those were the things he was most interested in
finding out."

At Richardson's arraignment Monday on a fugitive warrant, his
attorney told the court they're going to fight extradition back to
Florida. Under Missouri law, according to Taney County Prosecutor
Jeffrey M. Merrell, a judge can set bail for another state's
fugitive.

"We were opposed to the bond and we made that positively clear
to the court," Merrell said.

But one possibility for Florida authorities to sidestep
Missouri's courts, Merrell said, would be to obtain a governor's
warrant for Richardson's return from Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon. Then
the defendant's bail could be revoked, the prosecutor said, and he
could be sent back to Florida without an extradition hearing.

"We are working closely with Missouri authorities to
aggressively pursue Richardson's extradition to Florida," said
Bailey in a statement. "His debt to our state remains unpaid."
