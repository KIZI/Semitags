What the hell is it with demoncraps and their mandatory bullshit? What the hell ever happened to their spewing their bullshit of free choice?

Lawmakers in the nation's capital have floated a plan to require high school students to apply to college or trade school -- even if the students have no interest in attending.
The proposal is a bid to ensure students in the troubled Washington, D.C., school system at least have the know-how to navigate the admissions proces

Would be a pretty clever way of artificially inflating the proportion of minority students that get rejected from college. The left needs racism to thrive or else its ideology falls apart.

That isnt it.

Think about why college cost so much and how its funded. Another Voting block that has been bought.
 
 
Oh no, not the natural enemy of conservatism, EDUCATION!

Now with unadulterated BS.

Reason?
 
 
it'll never pass.
 
 
 
it'll never pass.

 

yeah but we still gotta pay these assholes to sit and dream up this shit.
 
 
DC lawmakers need to worry more about their ethical and legal violations. A bunch of them are crooks.

I teach my high school students to apply to college even if they never actually do. Some kids have no business in college. There is a need for more apprenticeship programs. Any idea how much a plumber makes?
 
 
What Santorum called "hubris and snobbery".

As it is, only 22% of our students graduate fro college. The repubs and teabags are right - that's way too much education for a lifetime of scrubbing floors and super sizing fatburgers.

Norway and South Korea are the best educated in the world. Let's continue our rush to the bottom and hand the planet over to them.
 
 
This law won't pass. But I don't see how it would be a bad thing if it did.

LOL. I think if that happens there will be a lot of people working in colleges who will just walk out. It's bad enough as it is trying to sort out who should and who should not be accepted when all who apply ARE qualified to be there. I've been on the admission committee and it's a nightmare. I can't imagine the hell that would ensue if every kid in the US had to apply to a college!
 
 
 
Oh no, not the natural enemy of conservatism, EDUCATION!

 

Kid, quit being stupid for at least two minutes in a row.

Government has no business mandating anything like this.

You know why Johnny graduates from high school illiterate?

Because you idiots taught him that feelings were more important than English, math, history, and science.

Oh, but you gave him a medal for participating.

Considering that the bulk of the liberal democrat voting block is uneducated poverty stricken minorities, I would think that educating them and allowing them a chance at a better life would be to the detriment of that party - not the republicans. Indeed, a person who has an economic and social stake in politics (i.e. owns property, works for everything they have, etc) would tend to lean toward the conservative ideology. You do realize those educated hippie liberal douche white folks who fashion themselves the saviors of minorities are but a small fraction of the voting force - they lead from the top an army of uneducated masses who believe they will give them all their desires.

My point is, I don's see where you are coming from on this one. In fact, I am educated from two institutions of higher learning, and granted much of my peers at the time (not too many years ago) were entranced by the ideals of the liberal idiocy of most college professors - it is when my peers entered the real world, where they began to find their what-you-may-call conservative side. It is difficult in many cases, such as my own, to apply a simple ideological brand of either liberal or conservative - indeed many of us are multi-fluidly-political based on certain areas of life, and of knowledge, and of the times.

Typical that the repubs/teabags are all kinds of crazy because of a WORKSHOP designed to teach students HOW to apply for college.

Much better to teach them how to vote Republican even though its against their best interests.

If we don't stop the GObP/Repubs, they really will drag us over the cliff with them.

Kid, quit being stupid for at least two minutes in a row.

Why not? Are local governments not allowed to set the requirements for their local school districts?

I was hoping someone would bring that up, which is why I said what I said.

My point is why are all of you so fucking uppity about the supposed liberal agenda in education when, by your very own admission, a majority of the people holding degrees are FUCKING CONSERVATIVE.

Hypocracy at its finest.

Did you go to college? Did all your fellow students belong there?

When I was in college in the '80s, there were kids who were just wasting someone's money. In my night classes at the local technical college, there are kids who are just wasting someone's money.

No, I agree there needs to be change. But destroying education entirely isn't the answer.

That's a one way trip to the bottom of the 3rd world barrel.

Yeah. Who says education needs to be destroyed, Captain Strawman?
 
 
The bill doesn't require them to attend. It just makes applying a part of their high school curriculum so that they know how to navigate the complications of applying to college. Another whine fest where one isn't even necessary. Shocking.

Give me a reason why someone should be forced to apply for secondary education if they don't want it since that is what the issue is about. It has absolutely nothing to do with one's opinion of education, but then, you already knew that.

Theyre not forced to attend. Theyre only forced to go through the application process as a manner of LEARNING IT, same as the rest of their mandatory curriculum is "forced." If they dont like it they can be home schooled.

Think back to when you actually did apply to college. I would have loved to have had a WORKSHOP like this to show me how its done.

 

I went to a little community college for a few night classes after high school so I could take classes that would help me work as a secretary and bring in a little extra money. My son was born 8 years later. I quit work until both my children were in school. When I was 35 I called the university to ask about how to get into their Nursing program. I didn't know that students answered the phone. I told the person who answered that I was 35 and was thinking about going back to school, he said 'WHAT? At 35? You are too old. You will NEVER be able to make it in this program!' So I hung up and forgot about it. A year later I was back in the same frame of mind about going to school, but was talking about the call to my husband. He said, 'If you want to go to school, go to school. So I made an appointment with the chair of the department. I took my old transcripts from the community college and I obtained my old ACT score and took that as well.' She said, ' Our older students usually do better. They are more settled and really want to be here. She looked at my transcripts and said, you have a 3.5, you will do fine.' I was not required to repeat the ACT because according to her they had dummed it down 3 times since I took it and she said mine meant more.

I doubt any 'workshop' would have helped a 35 year old housewife apply for college. I also didn't know about all the money that was out there for nursing students and no one told me until I was wanting to get my master's. So I paid every dime for the BSN. I was also called every kind of stupid for going to a 4 year nursing program instead of a 2 year program, 'after all it's the same thing.' Only it isn't the same thing. Not by any stretch. I wanted to be educated. I wanted to take all those science and humanities classes and learn what educated people got to learn.

A year and a half after I started back to school, my husand was dead of cancer. I have never looked back, and never regretted any of my education. But I know that what I did is not for everyone. The first people I looked for in Nashville were a plumber and an electrician. They were the first people I looked for when I moved back here and started working on this house.

I don't have a problem with teaching kids how to apply to college. I have a problem with the DC lawmakers. The mayor and several ward supervisors are crooks and need to get there own affairs in order and let the educators take care of educating.

Somehow I doubt even a workshop could have saved you from your chronic stupidity. Of course, if this were just merely a workshop, who would have a problem with it? You see, it's not. They're being forced to apply to institution of secondary education whether or not they want to. That is the issue the OP is bringing up, but you already knew that.

You keep assuming they're being forced to attend. They're not. Teachers are simply being mandated to add the college application process to their curriculum, and the Students are NOT being forced to attend. Nothing wrong with that, unless you've a problem with mandatory curriculum in general you're just whining.

Would be a pretty clever way of artificially inflating the proportion of minority students that get rejected from college. The left needs racism to thrive or else its ideology falls apart.

 

That isnt it.

Then why are you bitching just to bitch? Everything the Government does isn't some big evil power grab as your knee always seems to jerk toward.

right, just like learning earth science isn't an applicable skill if you're going to be a gym teacher - but it's still required. the purpose is to give the kids the tools.

right, just like learning earth science isn't an applicable skill if you're going to be a gym teacher - but it's still required. the purpose is to give the kids the tools.

 

I was not required to take Earth Science in high school, so that is not true. Furthermore, we aren't talking about ninth graders who are still impressionable and aren't thinking about what they're going to do with their lives when they're older. We're talking about 17 and 18 year old people who by that age have a pretty good idea as to whether or not they're going to attend post secondary education. There is no point in wasting time guiding students through this process if they aren't going to do it. They don't want to be there, they don't care about being there and they become disruptive.

I have no problem with them offering it up for students who plan on attending, but it's pointless to require everyone. It's a waste of their time when they could be learning life skills that are actually practical.
 
 
 
 
 
Who said they were forced to attend? They're all being forced to waste time going through the entire process even if they have no intention of going at all. How about spending that time on skills far more useful in the real world.

And then, there's calling the Registrar's office and asking 'where do I go to apply!'

 

Sunshine,

You're right, of course, except not everyone has the same "lightbulb" as the majority of people with good sense posess.

When I took a Computer course in college, we spent the first few days learning what a "mouse" is, what a "keyboard" is, etc, and the majority of the class were looking around at each other like..........what the fuck?!?!?!

Meanwhile, there were about three people who have (should be in Ripley's, tbh) not used a CPU before.
 
 
 
 
They're not forced to attend. Theyre only forced to go through the application process as a manner of LEARNING IT, same as the rest of their mandatory curriculum is "forced." If they dont like it they can be home schooled.

 

Who said they were forced to attend? They're all being forced to waste time going through the entire process even if they have no intention of going at all. How about spending that time on skills far more useful in the real world.

 

Because you are slowly trying to get rid of those skills as well.

This is well reasoned, and I agree to an extent, I just wouldn't see anything wrong with taking the flip side of the coin to public schools.

(I was required to pass earth science, ftr)

Oh no, not the natural enemy of conservatism, EDUCATION!

 

Kid, quit being stupid for at least two minutes in a row.

Government has no business mandating anything like this.

 

So much for the 'let local governments run local school systems' notion. Perhaps the federal government has no place, but the local boards of education and the states have that right and responsibility.

Unless the entirety of the United States public school system is now in the Conservative's cross-hairs. And that would bolster the perception of education really being the natural enemy of Conservatives.

This is a solution without a problem.

Yeah, they can do what they like -- I don't live there, thank Gaea.

I actually met a person whos real first name was 'Nosmo'.

His real last name was 'King'.

Kind of a cruel joke for a parent to play on their child. Maybe they were post office employees.
 
 
So much for the rightist mantra of allowing local communities to decide.

 
D.C. Council Chairman Kwame Brown, who introduced the bill, said the proposal would establish a "mandatory workshop" to teach teenagers how to apply for aid and admission. It would then require everybody to apply to at least one post-secondary school before graduation.

 

Local communities may compose whatever graduation requirements they wish.

 
Brown, in making the case for his bill, argued that several top charter schools in D.C. already require students to apply to multiple colleges. Such a requirement, however, is rare in a public school system.

 

If private schools already have the same requirement, why would conservatives object to the requirement in public schools?
 
 
 
 
 
Because you are slowly trying to get rid of those skills as well.

Twenty years. Two SECRET security investigations.

But, of course, you can't.
 
 
I am assuming that everyone understands that the 'local' government in D.C. is the U.S. Congress.

Kind of scary if you think about it.

Or you could just admit you're mindlessly lashing out like a little bitch. That's far more plausible.

Now with unadulterated BS.

Reason?

 

I'll I've heard on this forum for the past few days is how bad education is from the conservative members. Give me a reason to think you actually care about our education competing with other countries.

 

Many areas of the country are bad. You couldnt possibly defend what happened in Atlanta and later discovered throughout the country. You just can not ignore how education has fallen since the Dept came on line. I am not against national standards. Just how the money is pissed away.

Disgrace to the uniform.

 

Same honorable discharge, retirement check and benefits.

 

You got undeservedly lucky.

So just to be sure? On this issue you are not pro choice?

I let janitors pick up shit, so I'll hire someone to clean the toilet. But you can post your address it will help.

 

 

  You're a pussy.

 

Address?

 

I'd ask for your word that you yourself would show up, but you're a liar with no honor and integrity.

Besides, this is a rental. I'd hate to get your homey's blood on my landlord's carpet.
 In Kentucky the castle doctrine  says that there is no requirement to retreat when you are threatened with deadly force or when you are defending your home from an arsonist or burglar that is attempting to commit a crime.

Under the castle doctrine you are permitted to use deadly force.

Brown argued Wednesday that some D.C. students aren't going to college simply because they "don't know how to navigate the enrollment process."

 

Then fucking teach the ones who want to know, and stop trying to tell everyone ELSE what the fuck they should do.

How long were you in the military?

 

He hasn't been to a recruitment center ever. Or MEPS.

 

Wonder how I got to run around outside the wire to visit the  Ziggurat of Ur  outside  Ali Air Base  in Iraq packing an M-9, then?

 

And it was clever of me to con this full-bird colonel into faking my retirement ceremony, huh?

 

Or you could just admit you're mindlessly lashing out like a little bitch. That's far more plausible.

 

Lol. Maybe you shouldn't make such baseless claims about the military. Just makes your position even worse.

Exactly like my Step father who retired as an Air Force Captain. The man could do no wrong. Not because he was right, just because he couldn't conceive of being incorrect.

You are no different. Welcome to the real world prick. You aren't in the military anymore.

Of course you don't. You never see anything wrong with taking a person's freedom. Nor do you see any proble with the Federal governent usurping power that was never given to them.

College is clearly the only way someone can be educated. People should be forced to pay thousands of dollars so Democrat contributers can give them more. Anyone who doesnt go to college is an idiot.

Except most of the greatest minds of human history never attended a college. There goes that theory.

I'll I've heard on this forum for the past few days is how bad education is from the conservative members. Give me a reason to think you actually care about our education competing with other countries.

Elitist mentality to be sure.
 
 
 
This law won't pass. But I don't see how it would be a bad thing if it did.

 

The idea, in and of itself, I don't see as bad. But there are a few problems I have with it at this time.

1. Our education system, as it currently exists, does not offer enough good avenues. As was mentioned, we don't have enough trade schools and such opportunities. That is something that we need more of in this country, but probably won't happen any time soon. We need a fundamental restructuring of our attitudes and approaches to building opportunities for the young generations to prepare themselves to become self sustaining members of the workforce. Until then, this measure is putting the cart before the horse.

2. College applications take money. I'm not inclined to support a measure that would force low income families to drop $150 on application fees that they might not be able to readily afford, especially when they aren't going to be able to go to college even if they get accepted.

Kid, quit being stupid for at least two minutes in a row.

Government has no business mandating anything like this.

 

So much for the 'let local governments run local school systems' notion. Perhaps the federal government has no place, but the local boards of education and the states have that right and responsibility.

Unless the entirety of the United States public school system is now in the Conservative's cross-hairs. And that would bolster the perception of education really being the natural enemy of Conservatives.

 

Good thing D.C has solved all their other problems, huh?

This is a solution without a problem.

Yeah, they can do what they like -- I don't live there, thank Gaea.

But I reserve the right to voice my opinion, if that's okay with you.

And even if it's not.  

 

That's an argument born out of intellectual lassitude. School districts and their decisions are not weighed on a sliding scale against other problems communities face.

If their solution of holding a workshop to instruct students in the college application procedures succeeds, maybe unemployment, crime and poverty could be solved in the bargain. I don't live in D.C. either. And I don't live where Conservatives who dismiss education so blithely run anything too, thank God!
