NAME -- Teodoro Garcia Simental

NICKAMES -- El Teo, El Tres Letras

BIRTH YEAR -- 1974

BACKGROUND -- He was once considered a top hit man for Tijuana's dominant cartel, the family-run Arellano-Felix. After law enforcement arrested or killed most of the Tijuana cartel leaders in 2008, Garcia launched a new group affiliated with the Sinaloa Cartel. The splintered organizations have been involved in a violent turf battle in Tijuana.

REPUTATION -- Police say Garcia is particularly brutal and that his forces executed, beheaded and mutilated hundreds of rivals in Tijuana, sometimes pinning notes to the corpses, other times dissolving the bodies in acid.

TERRITORY -- Police say he attempted to control eastern Tijuana and Rosarito Beach.
