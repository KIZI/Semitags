Well you sure can tell there isn't a whole lot of Bears or Seattle fans here...otherwise there would be about 30 post by now.

Sure, I'll take the underdog myself.
 
 
Bears score early!

Hope that Seahawks player is ok. Very slow getting him off the field.
 
 
I hope the Bears win, so the Packers can kick their can up around their ears.
