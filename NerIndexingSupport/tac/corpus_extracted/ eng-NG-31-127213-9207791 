Michigan paid App 400K to come play the game.

It was pretty quiet when the plane took off cause most of the App
players had never flown.

The bus driver from the airport could not figure out how to pronounce
"Appalachian". Â He said they were going to get trounced.

On App's last offensive play, the coachs had a fight because the
offensive line coach did not want a running play because the line was
too exhausted to block.

On the bus away from the stadium, people were lining the road for
three miles just standing and clapping.

The bus back to App was met by a police escort at the county line, the
App stadium was packed with more people than attend a football game.

Ohio State bought 36,000 App tee shirts for their game with Michigan.
