Stop letting these people into the country for Christ sake. I don't care if their families were blown up. That particular group is SO dangerous to this country. Just look at the statistics.

Absolutely vile story.

But yeah, I suppose that because these two scumbags raped a girl then every single Afghan in the UK shares some responsibility right?

Shut up, stop trying to make the rape of a women into a political point.
 
 
*standard incensed inflammatory comment wishing vengeance*
 
 
surprised how the title didnt say "muslims" in it!
 
 
I was born here, as was my father.
Go back? To where?

I share blame in this because these sick humans are of the same ethnic group?
Well that's logical.

Where did I say they share responsibility with Afghans already here?

I said stop letting members of that group into the country for OUR safety. As a direct result of their cultural upbringing they are significantly more likely to commit acts of sexual abuse.

An immigration/border policy that bans entire groups of people entering a country would be a national embarrassment.

This is just a moronic and reactionary response.
 
 
disgusting. hope they get jailed for life.

Look at Oslo. Every sexual attack that has happened there over the past 2 years or so has been from immigrants (from Middle East/Africa).

Whilst we cannot ban entire ethnic groups or countries, I don't think plucking orphans from war torn Afghanistan and placing them in this country is a good idea.
 
 
If we tar everyone with the same brush, then surely we are all responsible... Because we are all of the same group in the animal kingdom o.O
homo sapiens.... we are the bane of the world.... *cue spooky music*
what does nationality have to do with anything? nationality is basically just what colour passport you have........ technically I'm british because I was born here.... but my grandfather was Austrian. so some people say i have part austrian blood... but why was he austrian? because he was born in austria....... but his parents were polish...... because they were born in poland......... to me there's no such thing as nationality in your blood because when it comes down to it nationality is literally just the place where you were born.....

ps.... as my grandfather was austrian... please deport me.. i am obviously going to turn into Joseph fritzl but female.......

In what way do the actions of two rapists represent the Afghan population? The vast majority of the Afghans who come here do so in search of better opportunities or to flee prosecution. Not only does Islam forbid such a heinous crime but the Pashtuns, the dominant ethnic group in Afghanistan, have their own strict code of honour under which if a woman is criminally assaulted and raped by force by a man with whom she had no previous illicit relations, then the woman is spared because of her innocence and the guilty man alone is put to death.

Always best to do some research rather than make vague, bigoted generalisations.

EDIT: Just to clarify for everyone so no one else asks about this: I'am trying to put forward the lack of tolerance in Afghan society towards rape both in the context of religion and culture NOT justifying the current treatment of women in Afghanistan.
 
 
omg, white paedophiles go to south-east asia to have sex with kids... must. ban. whites. from. asia.!!!

I doubt these orphans were plucked by HM government.

You want a selective immigration policy aimed at highly skilled migrants? Fine. Ban all Afghan zomg!!11 is stupid.
 
 
deport the scum but why would you stop immigrants because of 1 isolated attack? bit stupid really. not like were in their country raping their women....
 
 
In the US, real justice would have been served.

Negs: Imagine how the lady feels, why shouldn't they face what prisoners in the US do?

But still, there are good afghans, so stop putting it in "all of the people"...
In addition, I see also other people from england that do worse...
 
 
Anybody raping someone is wrong, but its not them being Afghani that made them rape that lady, its them being a bunch of rotten human beings that made them do it.
Its not religion or their nationality that is doing the raping, it is the person.

1. Asians have higher levels of sexual crime than whites look it up.

2. Yes there have been a tiny amount of incidences commited by the British Armed Forces, which were cracked down on (army justice isn't like civilian justice), but just remember that the US (our ally) was attacked by the Taliban who had taken over the country, as well as the fact that we are in Afghanistan by the request of the Afgan government.
 
 
I read on Wikipedia about how 1 in 20 woman in the UK would've been raped during their life-time and many in their teen's early 20's I feel sick of these people with nothing more to their life than to kidnap and rape young woman they should be shot!

You conveniently seem to have missed out the vast majority of my post  

Yes, Islam does forbid many heinous crimes as it forbids rape. The perpetrators of rape being Muslims or Muslims belonging to rape gangs doesn't change the rulings of the religion which they follow and which they sin against when they commit these acts. Afghanistan may be a third-world country but the majority of the people there adhere to a very strict code of honour (Pashtunwali in case you didn't notice the first time I said it) under which the sentence for rape is death.

In theory. No point having morals if they are rarely used.

The OP is a moronic nit too but Afghanistan is officially  the world's worst place to be a woman  so it isn't completely ludicrous to say that Afghan culture is contemptuous towards women. They can't all be misunderstanding their honourable culture and to a lesser extent, their religion can they? There is a widescale problem that goes far beyond the petty little rapists' beliefs. Back home, the most likely outcome is that the victim would currently in a ditch dying of blunt trauma injuries.

'Stop letting these people into the country for Christ sake. I don't care if their families were blown up. That particular group is SO dangerous to this country'

As for the cultural comment, I've not sexual abused anyone, nor do I intend to. Thanks for the label though, douchebag.

Because it's garbage. You're trying to convince people that Afghanistan is some kind of just society for women to live in. It's not. Women are treated like possessions, forced to fully cloth themselves for their insecure husbands and treated with inequality.

And that's why when so many immigrants from Muslim countries turn up in Europe, they decide to target non-Muslim girls.

I'm off to watch Night of Heroes 2011. Reading articles like this makes me feel even more grateful for them.

And why are they "Islamic" to be exact? Do the rapists run around with the Quran reciting verses while they assault women? No, because the members of the these so called gangs tend to be the least religious members of the community who have taken up alcohol and drug abuse from a young age and are only part of such groups for their own twisted, sadistic pleasure. Such gangs are routinely condemned in almost every mosque I have been to and the youth are actively encouraged to join clubs/societies etc. to limit their exposure to these things and promote good behaviour and discipline.

Maybe you should get out of your mum's cellar and see how the vast majority of Muslims actually live rather than forming a misinformed opinion of us being murdering, slaughtering, baby-eating rapists

I'm right winged for starters, and when immigrants rape people its because of their "cultural upbringing" but when white people rape somebody is it their culture?

Sure but we aren't discussing the general position of Afghan women here which I admit is atrocious but rather the penalty for rape both enshrined in Afghan Law but even more importantly enshrined in the strict moral code that the vast majority of the population follow. They're not misunderstanding their culture or their religion- they're merely not following them.

Fair enough.

But you've just contradicted yourself. You said the vast majority follows their strict moral code and then said that they don't at all. Either way Afghan culture as it is being followed NOW is a threat to all women (not originally though, but I'm not an expert); Muslim or otherwise. Is that a fair conclusion?

Yeah? Well this is what I said. I'll be grateful if you can highlight exactly where I suggested women and treated as equal to men in Afghan society:

"...have their own strict code of honour under which if a woman is criminally assaulted and raped by force by a man with whom she had no previous illicit relations, then the woman is spared because of her innocence and the guilty man alone is put to death.

I said the vast majority follow the code but THESE TWO and others who commit such crimes obviously don't... simples right?

Hmm... culture has a very wide definition. But yeah, I would agree with you on the fact that treatment of women in Afghanistan needs to be improved radically and urgently.

For you to stoop to such low level of vituperation and to steal a legal dispute and turn it into a political point is a good enough excuse to throw you out of the United Kingdom......

Though I do think a cap on immigration is best served.... It's about time and we all know it.

Furthermore as for not feeling empathy or sympathy for 'families... blown up', its a shame the UK hosts persons such as yourself who have no feeling...

Actually it does, these types of attacks tend to be much more common relative to their ethnic group. It could be something in their culture or could be that people in their ethnicity somehow have genetic reasons why this is more common or could be something entirely even more random.

The point if attacks are commonly done be members of certain races you don't just ignore it, you clamp down on the fact people in certain ethnic groups are more prone to commiting some sort of crime.

Also it does matter she is British, the goverment has a responsibillity to protect british people considering they are letting in high amounts of immigration.

You are talking about an individual case here, not an article which relates to those probabilities. This is not a racially motivated attack, nothing about race, it's a rape.

 
Also it does matter she is British, the goverment has a responsabillity to protect british people considering they are letting in high amounts of immigration in without even consulting it's people.
 

Utter nonsense.
 
 
Jailat Khan, of Beeston, Leeds, was ordered to be detained for five years and Shahzada Khan, of Leeds, was ordered to be detained for four years after both admitted kidnap and rape.

So, the current penalty for rape and kidnap is 4 years in the UK? That's scandalous.
 
 
I think all foreign criminals should get deported and banned from the UK. They shouldn't even be allowed to serve a prison sentence in the UK.
 
 
Hang them like Saddam or shoot them like Bin Laden, either way would be most effective.

Utter nonsense.

 

1 - You are totally ignoring the point, its a fact people in certain ethnic groups are more commonly involved in certain forms of crime. Hence just like Trident was set up to combat Black Gun Crime in London.

2 - No to call it nonsense is ignorant. To make it clear heres a good exadgerated theoretical example to get my point clear:
9/10 Immigrants have killed a British person. Therefore Goverment must look at why they are killing Britons, which is that because they are specifically letting in antibritish racist fanatic murderers...

Hence when a crime is commonly committed by a person of certain ethnicity due to open border policies and terrible risk assessments of people looking to come here the goverment should take responsabillity to protect it's people
 
 
 
deport the scum but why would you stop immigrants because of 1 isolated attack? bit stupid really. not like were in their country raping their women....

 

Deport? No porridge?
 
 
I find it funny that people felt the need to bring Islam into this, even when it wasn't mentioned.

Noone is saying Islam allows rape, not in this thread anyway, although it is debatable.

But what is undeniable is that certain ethnic groups tend to have very worrying attitudes toward women, and Western women specifically.

And to think British Soldiers are risking their lives to help the homeland of these boys.
 
 
Send these two scumbags home and bring all British troops back from Afghanistan.

That prehistoric hellhole isn't worth the life of a single British soldier.

In place of these two, allow a couple of pleasant, law-abiding immigrants into the UK.

And to think British Soldiers are risking their lives to help the homeland of these boys.

"Granma.....having a wonderful time in London.....wish you were here....."
 
 
You can't say certain groups doing certain things more often than others is irrelevant; just like you can't say that all people within the same group as others that have done something should share the credit/penalty. Both ideas are equally stupid imo.

Exaggerating to make is useful. If every single immigrant from Atlantis, every last one of those blue-skinned immigrants you'd ever met had assaulted someone, you'd be logical to get nervous if one sat next to you on a bus. If proportionately less had done so, this would become less the case and you'd be more and more close-minded for your weariness (the less statistically significant the difference actually is). It nonetheless remains a rational/logical process to be wary of things/people that are more a statistical potential hazard to you, unless of course your perceptions are based more on Daily Mail propaganda, and less on reality.

Obviously we are all individuals and you can't blame everyone of an ethnic groups for the actions of others within the same ethnic group. Well it should be obvious anyway, but this disclaimer is nonetheless needed because so many idiots in this country do apply that logic.

I personally fear talk of collectives and am a staunch individualist. Nonetheless, if certain groups cause more trouble than others it is logical to want to place more observations on immigrants from particular countries/peoples/groups.

Whether or not you agree with the welfare state, we have it, and this attaches an inherent cost on all of us for every new migrant, so we do clearly need restrictions or we would be flooded. So how do you proceed? Ignore the statistics and let people in on a random ad hoc basis, or only let enterprising people with the skills we need in, and those who are wealthier (and therefore less likely to cause trouble)?

Whilst we must be wary of racism it's obvious that particular individuals are more desirable as migrants than others. And if particular groups show grossly disproportionate statistical outcomes it is obvious that individuals within that group should be placed under greater scrutiny on the particular issues that are relevant to those disproportionate collective statistics.

That's not true, Oslo is famous for having a surprisingly high frequency of sexual crimes, which are found to mostly occur within marriage, between regular, middle class Norwegians.

they not kids they are men. you see this all the time on the tv shows and unfortunately they have to let them in.
 
 
It's a shame they only got 4 & 5 years in jail. Having said that, who are you to say these people ought not to be allowed to come in our country? Their 16 years old, not all grown, and indeed young afghan share the same motivation as these two boys. Many white, black and asian people have committed equally, if not worse crimes then this, should they be disallowed to come into the country?

For my money if they commit crimes this heinous then they should be deported, 16 or not. At 16 I'm sure that they should be able to realise the gravity of such a crime.
 
 
No matter what people you allow to come in the country, inevitably crime will still occur and it will not cease to exist. However, the best England can do is to try and educate as many people so that they can attemp to reduce crime. Kicking people out; such as the Afhans out of the country won't prevent rape and murder. I'm pretty sure the amount of crime they commit is not even a fraction compared to: white, blacks or indeed asians. You can kick all ethnicities out of the countries, but it isn't going to prevent crime, but educating people and mayby making laws stricter will.
 
 
why do people from this muslim community have such a low opinion of western women? its a disgrace that they come here for asylum and then rape western women. just in the last few months there have been the gravity of the muslim rape gangs who target white girls has been exposed. there is an ongoing trial at the moment involving a western girl who was killed by another muslim rape gang.

as usual the media is full of non racist incidents like john terry but ignores real violent racism. its not only sexist to downplay these horrendous crimes its also becoming racist because the victims are western.

unfortunately it matters in this case as there seems to be a hatred of western women by certain sections of the islamic community. this cannot be taken out of context with the rape gangs that target women specifically because they white.

I understand that, and I realise that there are certain cultural factors that have probably contributed to their horribly unjust perception of women. However the fact is, people from ALL backgrounds, cultures and ethnicities commit rape - even people who have been raised in the (comparatively) liberal climate of the UK where women have equal rights (or at least, they have MORE equal rights compared to the majority of women in Afghanistan and other places - I know there are issues about the pay-gap, maternity leave issues etc, but that's a whole other kettle of fish). So yes; their cultural views are certainly A factor, but to pinpoint them as the ONLY factor is a little misguided, I feel. If that were the case then it would ONLY be people from cultures with such views about women who committed rape. Which is obviously not the case.

Also I think it is just downright daft to tar all Afghans with the same brush. That would be like saying, just because a proportion of British people have been involved in particular actions in the war in Afghanistan that have resulted in civilian deaths/Afghan prisoners being tortured/etc, that every British person is a sadistic criminal who abuses their position as a member of the armed forces and should be sent back to the UK.

However the fact is, people from ALL backgrounds, cultures and ethnicities commit rape - even people who have been raised in the (comparatively) liberal climate of the UK where women have equal rights (or at least, they have MORE equal rights compared to the majority of women in Afghanistan and other places - I know there are issues about the pay-gap, maternity leave issues etc, but that's a whole other kettle of fish). So yes; their cultural views are certainly A factor, but to pinpoint them as the ONLY factor is a little misguided, I feel. If that were the case then it would ONLY be people from cultures with such views about women who committed rape. Which is obviously not the case.

Also I think it is just downright daft to tar all Afghans with the same brush. That would be like saying, just because a proportion of British people have been involved in particular actions in the war in Afghanistan that have resulted in civilian deaths/Afghan prisoners being tortured/etc, that every British person is a sadistic criminal who abuses their position as a member of the armed forces and should be sent back to the UK.

yes, all people of different backgrounds commit rape. 99.9999999% of which are men. but, still, it is not acceptable to simply ignore the fact that certain sections of the islamic community have very racist attitudes towards western women and they are specifically targeting white girls for rape and even worse. this is a very specific issue.

its frustrating because there is a clear pattern of racism here. sure, the police and the media are just starting to talk about it, after years of denial and still reluctantly, but still there is a sort of squeamishness simply because these crimes do not fit the expectations of the propaganda of multicultural society. but, people must think of the victims and stand up for them and not be worried about this silliness of political correctness.

if these rape gangs were white and victims asian then the army would be called in i am guessing.

i am not sure if you saw the documentary on channel 4 about the racist rape gangs.

The bold.

People only react when things get really bad, rather than acting to prevent them getting bad in the first place. British people are now moaning that the French have been targetting laws at Muslims and yes I believe they have, but when you look at the high levels of crime within the Muslim community in this country and then look at the fact that there are very few Muslims in Britain (really-although their population is set to explode) and that France has a 10% Muslim population (and the problems within our Muslim population are nothing compared with what the Algerians across the Channel are like) now even their version of the Labour party is starting to get fed-up with things we can see that the people denying the problem today with be forced to tackle it tomorrow only after so many more people have suffered.

For the record (ideally) I don't want full veils banned, and I don't want a far-right government, but the left's denial of these problems are leading this country down an inevitable road and everyone, Asian and White is going to suffer one way or another.
 
 
If I heard my girlfriend scream on the phone before getting raped I wouldn't be able to control myself if I saw those ****ers.

yes i totally agree.
 
 
I swear one of the guys looks like he is 20!
 
 
 
There is no such thing as "Afghanis". Afghani is the currency.

They are Afghans /pedantry/

 

The amount of times i see this is...well...facepalm-able  

Even some the GOP candidates in the debates refer to the Afghan people as "afghanis".

 
 
 
 
Stop letting these people into the country for Christ sake. I don't care if their families were blown up. That particular group is SO dangerous to this country. Just look at the statistics.

I just feel like going back in time just before the rape and punching them both in the face as hard as i can  

on a side note, when you said "Just look at the statistics.", i figured youd actually post the statistics rather than just the article alone... i find it hard to believe that afghan people are all dangerous... its *******s, theres no evil gene, you are who you were raised to be...if i raised an afghan baby, that doesnt mean hes going to grow up as a mental criminal...

Why aren't these two on the first plane back home to afghanistan to have sex with little boys or goats, whatever they do.,we have enough home grown vermin to deal with without looking after other countries.

Whoever stops deportation in this case needs to be flown back with them,if they love them so much. If they want to behave worse than wild animals do it somewhere else.
 
 
 
1. Asians have higher levels of sexual crime than whites look it up.

2. Yes there have been a tiny amount of incidences commited by the British Armed Forces, which were cracked down on (army justice isn't like civilian justice), but just remember that the US (our ally) was attacked by the Taliban who had taken over the country, as well as the fact that we are in Afghanistan by the request of the Afgan government.

 

why does everyone here talk about people being there for bullcrap reasons and that the afghans dont actually want them there?

if bold is true, then that makes a lot more sense
 
 
 
Lol   well, if you're running for president, i expect you to know the collective name of the people you are 'liberating', or am i asking for too much?  

 

Well GOP candidates - Ron Paul aside - are puppets of business and special interest groups so they are forced to spew generic lines that fit in with the wants of their backers (whether they believe them or not). Some are genuinely morons - like  Cain  and  Bachmann . The likes of  Gingrich  know exactly what they are doing and talking about, but for whatever reason propagate a destructive foreign policy.

An immigration/border policy that bans entire groups of people entering a country would be a national embarrassment.

This is just a moronic and reactionary response.

 

But we already have that kind of grouping of people - anyone born in Britain is free to live here, whilst anyone born outside is subject to immigration law. Yet that's completely fine, and you'd have to be a megaphone-waving, Charlie Veitch style fanatic to not agree with that

Yawn - are we going to get the nationalities of all the rapists, murderers, burglars etc commiting crime in this country posted on TSR on a Daily basis now  
 
 
 
If it can be established that cultural traits lead to higher incidences of certain serious offences amongst a specific cultural group then that cultural group should not be allowed into the country, apart from those individuals who can show beyond reasonable doubt that they are completely and utterly integrated with British culture.

 

and how does this sound-bite work when trying to create in immigration process in reality?

 
Your pathetically leftist "don't tar them all with the same brush, we're all individuals" argument has been shown to be consistently wrong in a massive proportion of cases.

I wasn't talking about illegal immigration. I was saying that we already do group people on a huge scale. People born in Britain have the automatic right to live here, people born outside Britain don't. So it wouldn't be massively different to ban all Afghans from emigrating here.
 
 
 
1. Asians have higher levels of sexual crime than whites look it up.

 

White english have a higher levels of paedaphillia and child abuse than Chinese and Japanese, whats your point exactly?
 
 
The fact her boyfriend heard the attack begin just added to the horrifying story. I, like all men, will (hopefully) never know the subjugation and degradation women can suffer at the hands of men. But the fact that these women have fathers, brothers, boyfriends and husbands is something we can directly identity with, and it's sickening. I would completely lose it if something like this happened to my girlfriend. I hope she remains strong after all this.
 
 
 
Look at Oslo. Every sexual attack that has happened there over the past 2 years or so has been from immigrants (from Middle East/Africa).

Whilst we cannot ban entire ethnic groups or countries, I don't think plucking orphans from war torn Afghanistan and placing them in this country is a good idea.

 

plucking? Imagine if you had seen your faqmily blown to pieces in front of you and been left with nothing? No family, no money. Nothing. Unless youve been in this specific position Im surprised how enthusiastically you comment on what should happen to people like this. Clearly you dont have any empathy for either party involved in this horrific incident or you wouldnt be using such an act to push your bigoted, xenephobic views. You too are exploiting this woman.
 
 
There is no way they are 16, if you read the comments you can see someone make the very coherent point that they probly lied about ages by a considerable amount so as not be deported when they first got here.
Also the jail sentence (4 ****ing years, and won't they be out in 2!?) is much more despicable then their race.
 
 
 
The point is... we already have our own scum to deal with, so what benefits can we possibly reap by importing additional scum?

 

I would seriously doubt that all afganis are of the same type of criminal scum you refer.

If your concern is simply with crime, then why not castrate all the white english male population also, given their high involvement in child abuse. Then we can talk about barring afganis
 
 
 
How does bringing them here help matters? They're still without family and will probably be without qualifications and money. They'll join our dole queues and our council housing system, where life for them will be almost as depraved as it was previously, and life for Britons will be needlessly depraved by their placement in our country.

There are millions of cases of extremely needy, desperate, impoverished and family-less people all over the world. For that reason alone it is inconceivable that "bringing them over here" is a viable solution.

Afghans belong in Afghanistan, not in Britain, unless they can show themselves to be fully integrated with our culture.

 

really? i know many afghans and havent met one who is on benefits. Unfortunately, Britain has not made many positive changes in their countries and many civillians have been killed needlessly. Why do Britons need to be there in the first place?

I agree that immigrants should be intergrated and committed to becoming culturally in sync with Britons, but they are two children, and frankly their ehtnicity has nothing to do with it, as most rapists are white males. Again ive met many, but none have raped me.
 
 
 
No, they don't KNOW their ages, and the British authorities gave them a statutory D.O.B of January 1st, 1995, which makes them, for "official" matters, 16 years old.

 

wtf, I think it makes sense they do KNOW their ages and just lied and said they didn't. This is a fairly common practice. Also they are blates not 16.

This post is so full of fail...
 
 
 
Where did I say they share responsibility with Afghans already here?

I said stop letting members of that group into the country for OUR safety. As a direct result of their cultural upbringing they are significantly more likely to commit acts of sexual abuse.

Did I tell you to "go back"?

Read the ****ing thread.

 

This is a huge human rights debate. The guys should not have raped this woman and were totally wrong to do so.I think you should behave wherever you are but particualrly when you are in a country that has taken mercy on you. These guys should have to give something back to the country for their time in prison - just like all people who break the law should- by doing free hard labour for the country.
But I understand why people think an asylum seeker who has broken the law should be sent back even if it is not my opinion.

The 'fruits?' You mean the right to commit crime?
 
 
 
I never said we should bar all Afghans. I said we shouldn't let any Afghans in unless they can show us beyond all reasonable doubt that they have integrated with the cultural values and practices that we want to see in our societies, and that they have the necessary skills, qualifications and knowledge to contribute value to our societies..

 

  How exactly do they integrate if we dont let them in to do so?

I would think also in this case these two afganis were asylum seekers, rather than migrants applying for a work permit, which you might be mixing up

And finally im of the opinion that because they are criminals, they would be deported as per the UK immigration policy. ( if they werent i would take great issue) SO these criminals are being (will be) dealt with, happy? Now do you also agree to being chemically castrated, given you belong to a high risk ethnic group?

 
And finally, the involvement of Britons with an indigenous culture, or a related culture (American, European, Austral-Asian, etc) in child abuse/sexual crimes is lower PER CAPITA, then that of those with a non-indigenous culture.

 

No it isnt, as i just pointed out to you. chinese have the lowest incidence of all but immigration related crimes in the uk

I'd rather we cleared our heads and stopped letting political correctness interfere with our ability to make reasoned and informed decisions on immigration based on statistics, and if we did so, such crimes would be PREVENTED.

 

Them being here is nothing to do with political correctness and everything to do with our soldiers blowing up their houses over there.

 
After all, we brought them here knowing fine well that they were deranged and damaged children from a depraved culture.

 

  On the basis 2 afgans raped someone? what about the culture in this country in which a women is raped evey 10 mins ( so i read on tsr). What does it say about you - a youth of british nationality in that case?

 
And finally, I'm of a relatively low risk group - it's not about ethnicity, it's about CULTURE.

 

What exactly in your culture do you think makes you a low risk group?

Again, more falsehood, you are actually substantially much in a higher risk group than general white english because you will be a male in the age group 20-40 and so will be an even higher risk in the respect of many crimes, including sexual assault. Whether its because of your ethnicity or culture i couldnt say, but logic dictates that you should be castrated in order to reduce likelihood of your offending.

 
So? Why are we talking about the Chinese? It's not relevant.

 

It was as relevant as you ( or the other fellow) quoting any ethnicity statistics, that was my point. If you ahd an issue with an enthicities invovment in crime, then there is a greater risk posed by young white english males as an offending group.
 
 
I'm disgusted at how short their sentences are. They are clearly dangerous people and should be kept out of society as far as I'm concerned.
 
 
 
Them being here is everything to do with the crass defence of multiculturalism propagated by leftist fools - the same people who are responsible for the PC culture. The PC culture, btw, is what's responsible for the ridiculously short sentences and early releases.

It doesn't say anything about me because it's not about nationality or ethnicity. It's about culture and how our morals are informed.

I don't know how often there's a rape in Britain on average... but since immigrants contribute to those rapes you can't use that statistic to show that British people are in a rape-frenzy. You have to look at who is responsible for those rapes and why. It's not to sufficient to say "there are a lot of rapes".

Well for starters I'm not sexually repressed by religion or political theocracy, which seems to be a major risk factor for rape and sexual assault and abuse of women and children.

You clearly don't understand statistics... or logic, for that matter.

There are more rapes by white males in Britain because there are more white males in Britain than any other type of male. Not because we're more rapey. But because there are more of us. i.e. if I had an island with 900 white men and 100 Asian men, and a number of women, and 10 Asian raped some women and 50 white men raped some women, that doesn't mean that white men are more rapey than Asians, actually it means that the Asians are, because there's more rapes per 100 Asians than per 100 Britons. i.e. take a random sample of 100 Asians and 10 of them will be rapists, take a random sample of 100 Britons and 6 of them will be rapists.

Not per capita. By sheer numbers, yes, but not per capita, and that's what's important - that's what tells you whether a particular group of people is more problematic.

Using my earlier example, if a girl sees a group of 10 white blokes coming down one side of the street towards her, and a group of 10 Asians coming down towards her on the other side, she'd do well to stick to the side with the white blokes because the statistics would dictate that one of the members of the Asian group was a rapist whilst less than 1 (i.e. none) of the members of the white group was a rapist.

Of course, I've exaggerated the statistics for clarity of example, but the same logic applies regardless.

 

Again not at all- by capita as you say, there are various crimes that white ethnic english males are at the top of the offending list, not simply by totals. I think you clutching at that particular straw on the hope i dont understand statistics is not going to help you.

In fact the the more specifically you look into the stats, they more stark they become, for example for cases of assault of sexual nature on children under the ages of 13, the statisitcs that i had seen for maybe 18 months ago, were vastly dominated by white males ( something well over 94 %). In Some asian countries (Thailand, vietnam, phillapines) white english males are reported to have a disproportionatly high involvement in child sex abuse, but to this point i havent seen them stopping english guys at the airport

So by your analagy, if a women is walking with her child and sees a group of white english males, she should run to the nearest police station to be safe.

There are interestingly other crimes such as murder of the elderly which arealso heavily stacked in the white english male group ( mainly due to harold shipman) But that is still what the statistics show.

And if you disect the statistics you refer to regarding 'asians' you wil see over 95% of those were pakistani - so in fact you could compare indian, afgani, sri lankan etc alone against offending rates for english white males, and see again that white males were far higher offending rates ( after pakistanis).
 
 
This is disturbing...I've been down that alley...
 
 
Well obv the fact that they are afghanis has a point because they come from a country they has no respect for womens rights. You couldn't obv quantify how much that fact contributed to the crime if at all but it is obvpiously relevant in an argument against immigration from these countries. Similarly with asian gangs grooming women for sex in the midlands.
 
 
 
Quite possibly. Personally I can't tell, but I'm sure the British authorities can't have gotten it too far off.

 

You have a ludicrously high opinion of the government.  
 
 
Thing i don't get with this issue is community leaders are saying it's a problem in their own culture, sociologists are saying it's a cultural problem, social workers are saying it's a cultural problem. So why the hell does there seem to be so little done by the government to tackle the issue?

No one with any sense will say everyone from that part of the world will do something like this but there is a fundamental cultural problem with the way women are viewed in these communities that enables people to think it's ok to treat women like this, if you watch any of the documentaries on the whole Asian gang rape issue you will see when they interview the parents of the men involved attitudes like;

"what they did was unacceptable, but if girls weren't out at night this wouldn't have happened"
"what they did was wrong but the social workers failed my sons as well by allowing girls out dressed so slutty"

On the surface attitudes like this might not seem to cause problems, but the way the women are viewed as partly to blame because they were out at night or dressed a certain way acts as an enabler for some members of the community to act the way they do. Yes advising women not to go to x area at night because it is dangerous is a sensible thing to do just like advising someone to lock their door when they go out to prevent robbery is a sensible thing to do but if a woman is attacked regardless of where she is or what she is wearing she is not at fault for "leading them on" or "encouraging their behavior"

Imams/community leaders are running classes to try and remove this fundamental view of women from young men in their communities and they barely get any support from their council, one in Manchester was nearly shut down because of lack of funding yet it is clearly the best way to tackle this issue. Gonna play a dodgey card here but a lot of the people who recognize this as a cultural issue come from said culture, surely if people with first hand knowledge tell you what a problem is it would be borderline retarded to not listen?

Currently the UK is in a situation where integration of certain cultures is becoming more and more difficult, you can go to any major city and find areas that have a high population of X culture because they all like living together in their own mini community which is a natural thing to do however when an issue like this arises it makes tackling it very difficult and so far the government seem fine letting people from these places in and allowing them to keep their cultural heritage however make absolutely no attempt at dealing with culturally incompatible beliefs. It's like they are building someone a house with no roof then refusing to accept that's why it is filling up with water.
 
 
 
I like your use of words... better than white/brown...

 

To be fair white and brown are purely racial terms which have little nationalistic bearing in modern Britain.

However expecting to put British citizens ahead of asylum seekers and immigrants is perfectly understandable.

Though that is an entirely different discussion and has little bearing on the criminality of two boys raping someone. Seems a straight up judicial issue to me.

 
Culture.

 

True that, to be fair though the New Labour government was ideologically opposed to 'hard integration' or whatever you want to call it which has lead to a fairly notable seam of ethnic divide, and the current Conservative government just doesn't care because a few hardliners probably just think "lol darkies" and the rest are too busy cutting funding from every last thing to be able to pay for 'lessons on being British (lecture 1: Women are not chattle)'.
 
 
They should be put up against a wall and shot. Either that or forced labour until death. I am deadly serious.
 
 
Jallat Khan sounds like a bad ass. Take what you want and don't give a sh it.
 
 
This is a cultural/racial matter. You know there is a problem in your country when foreign 16-year old rapist immigrants are free to prowl your streets, preying on your nation's vulnerable women.

But whatever, go ahead and keep deluding yourselves that there is no problem whatsoever, everybody on the planet is the same, culture/nationality doesn't matter, and all cultures have equal respect for women. Couple of 16-year old Afhgan immigrants rape some women in your country? No problem, nothing to see here people.
 
 
If they're direct immigrants, ie weren't born here, why not deport them?
 
 
To people who say that it doesn't matter that they're Afghan - it DOES matter. Stop being so politically correct.

Yes it is considered racist to stereotype people according tot heir ethnicity, but why should it be wrong to give a reasonable explanation (not justifyable of course) to their actions?

They act that way because in the particular country they come from, it is perfectly acceptable to rape and beat women and children. As far as their upbringing suggests, they have done nothing wrong. The fact that one of the boys threatened to rape a female member of staff at the police department just proves that more.

If a British person was brought up that way, they would act the same way. The same applies to an Afghan person who had a different upbringing in a different country.

CULTURE AFFECTS WHO YOU ARE, NOT ETHNICITY.

It is therefore absolutely fair and justified to mention that the boys were born and bred in Afghanistan and haven't been in England for a long time. It gives a reason to the cause of their actions so that appropriate measures can be taken against it. e.g. explain to them that culture in England is different and that women are people too (although I don't believe that would work in the majority of cases because upbringing is difficult to change. The main cause of action should be in changing the views of the country itself so that the children of the new generation could have a better future. Too difficult to implement though).

Sorry m8 but Afghanistan has been a sh i t country that blows everyone up way before America interfered. In fact the American troops are going to make Afghanistan slightly better imo, although education would be a better solution than military presence.

Currently the UK is in a situation where integration of certain cultures is becoming more and more difficult, you can go to any major city and find areas that have a high population of X culture because they all like living together in their own mini community which is a natural thing to do however when an issue like this arises it makes tackling it very difficult and so far the government seem fine letting people from these places in and allowing them to keep their cultural heritage however make absolutely no attempt at dealing with culturally incompatible beliefs. It's like they are building someone a house with no roof then refusing to accept that's why it is filling up with water.

 

Just say this guy's post - he articulated what I was trying to say in a much better way.
 
 
Deport - just deport.
 
 
Only joined today and hell you people are racist.
Some afghans are gangster bruv dont wanna be messing  
 
 
i dont mean to be racist or cause controversy (really not)....but there is evidence of a miniority of muslim arabs coming into this country and raping and abusing white women aswell as there is evidence of a minority of british and american soilders going into their county and raping and killing their women.
 
 
Indo-Chinese - big chip on your shoulder there buddy?
 
 
No matter what it is there's always some people apologising for people from a race they don't even know.

Most of the time they don't even know what most of these people are like, but they're willing to accept in such a way they'll argue for them... Despite not knowing them..?!
 
 
 
.

If a British person was brought up that way, they would act the same way. The same applies to an Afghan person who had a different upbringing in a different country.

 

Except for the fact that plenty of rapes occur in this country by indigenious british people who have lived all their life in this culture. Which kind of isses all over your point.
 
 
****ing animals shouldn't be allowed to stay in this country! Deport these two scumbags and let them suffer the atrocity of an Afgan prison sentence!
 
 
This is why we should not give asylum to third world migrants. Afghans treat women lower than dogs, why do we let these bastards into our country
 
 
 
1) It is not one isolated attack my dear.

2) Don't disrespect the British Army.

 

Just **** off. ok

If you disrespect the British army then maybe you should **** ofback to whatever third world, poverty ridden toilet you came from.

are we forgetting rapists exist in all society's?

regardless of skin colour or belief, rapists exist every were and are not confined to sub cultures or countray's like Afghanistan.

And people are pin pointing here that we need to get rid of afghans? lets look at some of the usa troops in Afghanistan:

"The daughter of an Afghan politician has reportedly died of her injuries after being raped by American soldiers stationed in Afghanistan's southwestern province of Farah"
 http://www.presstv.ir/detail/159958.html 

as i said before you can not put the blame of these hideous crimes to race/culture or religion.

Culture and religion have ****ing everything to do with it, you utter moron. We British do not know the extent of rape by culturein the UK becausewedo not release information in correlation to ethnicity.

However youlook at Scandanavia, Sweden, Norway, and Finland etc are currently under a rape crimewave, with rapes being comitted by thirdworldmigrants and asylum seekers,the level of rape these countries are seeing is horrendous.

For instance In 2009 the Oslo police reported that rape statistics for the past three years showed that none of the rapes in the city were committed by native Norwegians — all were committed by immigrants.

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6k9P7L3tYk 

Sweden has currently twice the level of rape of the UK or the USand almost every single on of them are comitted by third world asylum seekers and immigrants.

Culture has everything to do with rape, and third world cultures treat women as subhuman, don't you DARE try and say ethncity is irrelevent, it is entirely relevent

There are a ridiculous amount more rapes in Afghanistan than in the UK. Of course rape happens in every country because it is innate in some men, but it is more likely to happen in countries where attitudes to it are positive.

You saw how the boys reacted to the rape? Almost any other rapist brought up in Afghanistan would react that way (because it's a majority opinion). In the UK any rapist would try to deny the evidence of the rape or at least not show pride of it, unless he was completely insane or brought up by a family that taught him rape was absolutely right (much less likely but not impossible)
 
 
Instead of blaming X,Y,Z, try to start blaming the actual perpetrators.

I don't see all this 'rationalising' when it comes to the astronomical level of crime committed by the white community. (2010/11 British Crime Survey (BCS) Page 59)  [1] . But why of course it's not over-proportional so 'that's superb'. Yet "the risk of being a victim of personal crime was higher for adults from a Mixed background than for other ethnic groups" and even for all members of the BME community.  [2] . Something doesn't add up.

As for Oslo, in case you don't believe me, please do contact the Royal Norwegian Ministry of Justice and the Police rather than looking at Islam-hate sites because you'd find a different response:

Statistics regarding assault rapists:
The Oslo Police District has given a report of rapes in Oslo in 2010. The report shows that for all types of rape, except assault rape, European perpetrators are in the majority, and they are mostly Norwegian. Assault rapes covers only five identified unique person. These have all a foreign origin. The number is however, so low that it does not provide a basis for drawing conclusions with regard to country of origin. Two of them were very young (under 18) and two had severe psychiatric diagnoses and cannot be regarded as representative of their ethnic culture. It is highlighted in the report that generalizations like “Oslo’s rapists are foreigners”, which have been seen in media, are wrong. The report gives no statistics regarding religion of rapists.

Yours Sincerely,

Grethe Kleivan
Deputy Director General  [3] 
 
 
You can't generalise a whole nation due to the acts of a few, also remember how many afghans have probably being killed unjustly by British forces, not that i am taking responsibility from the scum who raped this lady. However is it any suprise that third world countries will bring third world problems to the u.k, not that rape is only restricted to third world countries of course, but it wouldn't be a shock if you see an increase in rapes occurring in the u.k, in relation to the amount of immigrants from the far east and africa, coming over. I never used to think such things, but after doing a bit of travelling around the far east, you can clearly see the cultural differences. Try being a blonde woman strutting around wearing a mini skirt in downtown mumbai, they are not liberal and tolerant like we are other in the u.k.

Miniskirt or not, you'd probably get harassed eitherway in India. It's called "eve-teasing", a culture promoted by playful songs in Bollywood films where the hero tries to gain admiration from the heroine. It doesn't bode well.

Contrast this to Saudi, where there is a conservative dress code, but this culture is shunned. Forget about the religious police for a second, it feels shameful to even look at the miniskirt let alone even wear one.

From personal experience, this wasn't some cute bollywood stance, there was groping involved, and you are right the female in question wasn't wearing a miniskirt. It is there culture, not deeming it as right, and i am not deeming it as wrong, however is it any surprise that it is going to come over along with "them". Immigration is good, and mass immigration is questionable, if there was effort and money put in, to help integration and language teaching for the newly arrived immigrants in recent year, it wouldn't become a problem, but it has been ignored, or has been massively outweighed by the quantities of people coming over. The reason why you are seeing ghettos being formed. With all fairness to the immigrants of these third world places, there would be no incentive or advantage to adapting yourself to the western way of life, when you have a community, that makes you feel like home.

yeah i get your point, but its up to them if they want to wear one i suppose.
 
 
 
however is it any surprise that it is going to come over along with "them".

 

It's difficult to identify whether somebody wants to harass women.

As long as there is effective punishment in place and a culture that shuns that type of behaviour, there is greater prevention.

It is. It's a deeply religious society, probably the most religious around the world.
 
 
This would never have happened if she had gone on a slut walk.

Of course they need to be deported but they will end up in our CJS; then they will be released and given state benefits. I am not saying they should not be here in the first place but they need to be treated like foreign criminals.

I don't understand your point ? Its not difficult to identify if someone is harassing a woman or not, and i don't think a deeply religious society, is necessarily a moral one.

I didn't say that. "It's difficult to identify whether somebody wants to harass women".

Whether or not someone has the intention of harassing a woman is difficult to know.

Uh, in Afghanistan, before the US/West invaded, the punishment for rape was execution. Rape by all means was very low in that country.

Ever since the Taliban have been toppled and the invasion begun, Rape and other corruption has increased.

The only one's to blame here is the foreign invaders, no one else. Once Taliban drive them out of their lands, rape too will diminish.
 
 
well why stop at chucking out afghans? why not chuck out every 16 year old too?
FFS. stupid thread, not sure if troll actually.

It's a shame they only got 4 & 5 years in jail. Having said that, who are you to say these people ought not to be allowed to come in our country? Their 16 years old, not all grown, and indeed young afghan share the same motivation as these two boys. Many white, black and asian people have committed equally, if not worse crimes then this, should they be disallowed to come into the country?

 

well obviously.
 
 
 
disgusting. hope they get jailed for life.

 

No, just four years. Probably serve half that for good behaviour. Then out to rape again. Immigration is a wonderful thing, eh.
 
 
 
deport the scum but why would you stop immigrants because of 1 isolated attack? bit stupid really. not like were in their country raping their women....

 

Raping? We're over there protecting their useless country. Mainly from each other. If they pulled their heads out the stone age then we wouldn't need to

So every Afghani is a vile according to your logic. Wow, are you that moronic? Can you see that by generalising you're only making yourself look like a fool? Let's hope you can.
 
 
I'm shocked that we still permit these people to enter, ever since we devised a foolproof psychic method of detecting future rapists.

Oh, wait...

Doesnt matter she is British

Slightly random,

But next year is going to be amazing huh  

Already mentally sorting out my days off for cinema trips! The Dark Knight Rises is going to be EPIC!

Regarding OP's story. Disgusting. But I don't agree with the statements 'Deport them back to their own country!'

Why? To put these awful humans in the paths of even more vunerable women in Afghan? I don't think so. Castration is my preferred choice. They are afghani's after all..an eye for an eye..

When Mullah Omar used to send his men to the front line to fight the Northern Alliance (or whoever), he usually gave them a "blank marriage certificate" so pretty much an invitation to rape. Moreover for centuries, Afghan men have taken boys, roughly 9 to 15 years old, as lovers. However the practice of "Bacha Bazi" (pretty much pedophilia in disguise) rose under the Taliban rule and there were many reports of commanders kidnapping young boys who they would later sodomise. Finally there are many individual examples of Taliban brutality including rape. In the book "The sewing circles of Herat", the author writes that Taliban recruits were encouraged to use extreme torture methods against people they caught breaking the law such as beating them to a pulp until they lost unconsciousness and then sprinkling salt and pepper on their wounds. Another example is the genocide in Hazarajat where the Taliban went house to house murdering all Hazaras of fighting age often by shooting them in the testicles or the face. Their bodies were then left to rot outdoors for 5 days at a time and often were further mutilated by dogs.

Whatever Afghanistan is now- and admittedly it is still backward and tribal for the most part- the situation in general in terms of education, infrastructure, economy has improved a lot since the US invasion.

"reports"   Continue being brainwashed, this is the same as a USA commander doing it but he would do it in secrecy.

No doubt Taliban would never approve of something like that. I don't know if you've heard, homosexuals are usually executed in ME, so i'd imagine Sodomy with boys would be little exception.

This is all I found - In December 2010 a  Wikileaks  cable revealed that a US company,  DynCorp  had spent money on  pimps  who purchased young boys for Afghan policemen. The boys were used in Bacha bazi.  [17] 

Which only shows that it's being done by people who are supported by the USA/government puppets.

Although this just tells only a small tale, the red part gives it a new context.

I can't be bothered writing dissertations so briefly, your argument is pretty much that Afghanistan was in a better state under the Taliban than it is now. All the stats and the situation on the ground which has seen the Afghan economy rising out of the ashes, infrastructure being built, educational standards being raised points to the fact that you're wrong.
 
 
 
Look at Oslo. Every sexual attack that has happened there over the past 2 years or so has been from immigrants (from Middle East/Africa).

Whilst we cannot ban entire ethnic groups or countries, I don't think plucking orphans from war torn Afghanistan and placing them in this country is a good idea.

 

it's not cos there bad deep down... its probably cos they are already treated as pantomime villains b4 they did anything wrong. Also, racist remarks from people who say it as a joke is also going to fuel their dislike 4 the british even more, never mind the fact that british and american troops are playing there part in the destruction of THEIR country just to find some petty group.... grow up
 
 
 
Look at Oslo. Every sexual attack that has happened there over the past 2 years or so has been from immigrants (from Middle East/Africa).

 

That has been proven as false Israeli propaganda

So you were chatting out your arse then. Thanks for confirming what we all suspected. You can go back to making excuses for the Taliban now.  

 

Here's your proof, from your own kaafir(non-muslim) source -
Rapes targeting girls as young as seven are on the increase in Afghanistan where conditions for women are little better than under the Taliban, the U.N. and rights groups say.

In its annual report on human rights, the U.N. warned conditions were deteriorating in the war-ravaged country despite U.S.-led efforts after the 2001 removal from power of the hardline militia

Continue being in denial though, your pretty good at it  

 
I can't be bothered writing dissertations so briefly, your argument is pretty much that Afghanistan was in a better state under the Taliban than it is now. All the stats and the situation on the ground which has seen the Afghan economy rising out of the ashes, infrastructure being built, educational standards being raised points to the fact that you're wrong.

 

It's fine as long as rape, crime, child abuse is rising right.

Guess we can agree to disagree

At least the situation afganistan is a "little better than under the Taliban", an islamic regieme as you quote, so if figures are rising now, what must they have been like under the taleban?

Women probably were more protected and safer. Sure, they had less rights, but atleast corruption was less.

I'm sure when Taliban retain power they'll make those changes that are necassary for the better. From my understanding, Taliban aren't against womens education, they're against gender mixing education.

Not according to your quote, regarding safety of young girls. You need to find new source - taleban banned women from leaving home for work ( apart from nurses jobs) and also women going to university, as well as banning female cosmetics, women laughing loudly, wearing shoes that make a noise, playing sports, being filmed or photographed, or attending festive celebration, such as eid.
Of course taleban also banned various things for all genders of muslim too, like football and the internet.

Taleban has been called the closest thing to a truely implemented islamic society

I don't know if you understood my quote, but it stated a paradox. Rape was higher in places where "womens conditions supposedly improved since Taliban were toppled".

And so is corruption.

That's not good at all. And the authenticity of some of your claims (most likely copied from wiki) are unauthentic/myths.

Women were't banned from "wearing shoes that make noise" lol  
 
 
 
Stop letting these people into the country for Christ sake. I don't care if their families were blown up. That particular group is SO dangerous to this country. Just look at the statistics.

The west is a danger to the world, it started both world wars, behind the major recent ones, ect, just look at the statistics.

The details came from a perfectly sound source - Felix Ermacora, Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights in 1994. My sources are aways bone-fide unlike some who scrape the bottom of the www barrel.

And your quote makes no sense it says rape has risen in afganistan where conditions for women are little better than under th taleban - suggessting rape was a little higher under them.

Also you fail to mention, the article you quote states 'rape' stats there includes honor killings," early and forced marriages - which are endemic in various muslm communities, not just post taleban afganistan. Women in the muslim community in the uk for example suffer from it too.
