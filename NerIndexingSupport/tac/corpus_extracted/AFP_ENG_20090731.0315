The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development said Friday it has approved
a loan to Serbia worth 150 million euros (212 million dollars) to finance a
strategic motorway.

"Through this loan, the EBRD reinforces its commitment to support the
modernisation of transport infrastructure in Serbia," the bank said in a
statement quoting EBRD transport business director Thomas Maier.

"The construction of the E-80 motorway is a strategic project for Serbia and for
the region," Maier added.

Once completed, the 90-kilometre (55-mile) motorway will run from Nis,
Serbiaâ€™s third largest city in the southeast, to Dimitrovgrad on the border
with Bulgaria.

"With a total cost of approximately 795 million euros, the project is co-
financed by the World Bank, the European Investment Bank and the Republic of
Serbia," the EBRD said on its website.

The EBRD is single the largest investor in Serbia, which plans to invest around
four billion euros in road projects by 2013.
