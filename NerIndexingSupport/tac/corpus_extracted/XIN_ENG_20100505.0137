Katima Mulilo, Namibia, May 5 (Xinhua) -- LL Bio-fuels Namibia, a highly
ambitious foreign-initiated and multi-billion-dollar venture, has secured
300,000 hectares of land from chiefs in the north-eastern Caprivi Region to
plant jatropha, whose seeds will be press-crushed to produce the much-sought-
after biodiesel.

When jatropha seeds are crushed the resulting oil can be processed to produce a
high-quality biodiesel that can be used in a standard diesel engine, while the
residue or press cake can also be processed and used as biomass feedstock to
power electricity plants or be used as a fertilizer because jatropha contains
nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium.

The jatropha plant may yield more than ten times as much fuel per hectare as
soybeans and more than ten times that of maize.

Jatropha biodiesel that can be used as fuel for trains, vehicles, trucks, ships
and aircraft has many advantages in that unlike fossil fuels, it has fewer
emissions and is a less pollutant fuel and another plus is that it is
comparatively cheaper compared to fossil fuel.

Another positive aspect of biodiesel is that it is cheaper to produce a unit of
this blend of fuel and does not require the chemicals required to refine the
crude fuels that are processed into petrol, diesel and other petroleum products
such as lubricants.

LL Bio-fuels signed a 20-year lease agreement with the co- owners of Katima Farm
-- the Caprivi Regional Council and Namibia Development Corporation (NDC) -- to
enable the firm to undertake various crop experiments aimed at maximum oil
output.

Alon Vered, an agronomist and project manager for LL Bio-fuels Namibia (Pty), on
Monday told a Xinhua correspondent who visited the Caprivi Region that the
Israeli-owned biofuel venture has planted 400 different jatropha crop varieties
on 15 hectares of the 400-hectare Katima Farm to see which of the selected pilot
crop varieties has a higher diesel yield and is suitable for Namibia's north-
eastern region.

If everything goes according to plan and if ongoing negotiations with the
government sail through, LL Bio-fuels plans to produce the first barrels of the
green fuel next year, he told Xinhua adding that the fuel will cost about 75 U.
S. dollars per barrel, which is equivalent to about 200 litres. The product is
most likely to be cheaper than fossil diesel.

The company also intends to engage one of the multi-national oil companies once
it starts production, possibly to explore avenues on how it can tap into this
lucrative market.

So far, the project, mooted and funded by an Israeli tycoon has invested N$20
million for the ongoing experimental phase. But once the Israelis are content
with the yield, billions of dollars will be pumped into commercial production of
jatropha on 20,000-hectare portions of the land availed by the chiefs.

"Our target is to find the best jatropha tree varieties that yield 3 to 8 tons
of diesel per year, that is why we are experimenting to see which variety is
suitable for Caprivi," explained the agronomist, sent to Namibia by Lev Leviev,
the Israeli investor.

He said since the 300,000 hectares availed by all the chiefs in Caprivi is more
than adequate "we only want to plant 20,000 hectares at a time. And the jatropha
seed will go to a press machine, just like olive oil seeds, to squeeze out the
bio- diesel. "

The firm intends to channel some of the billions of dollars into a hi-tech
chemical plant that will comprise a huge seed press and some silos for the
storage of the oil-rich seeds. Once crushed and the bio-fuel extracted, the
seeds will leave a residue that will be converted into a organic fertiliser that
will be spread on the jatropha plants.

For every 20,000 hectares of land planted with the deep-rooted and drought-
resistant jatropha that produces seeds all-year- round, the firm expects a yield
of a million barrels and for 100,000 hectares 5 million barrels of bio-fuel will
be extracted from jatropha.

"All this bio-diesel produced we will use it for Namibia and export some of it.
We want to be the biggest producer of bio-fuel in Africa especially for bio-
diesel," he said.

He also said unlike Angola and Nigeria amongst several African and other
countries that have commercial crude oil deposits, Namibia imports this
strategic resource to meet domestic energy needs spending crucial foreign
reserves on its oil bill.

American pioneer entrepreneur, Henry Ford, was the first to use bio-diesel when
he successfully used oil extracted from groundnuts to fuel a motorized vehicle.

Namibia also imports between 70 and 80 percent of its food mainly from
neighboring South Africa but the Katima Mulilo-based investor wants to offset
this colonial legacy of food imports and dependency by making Namibia self-
sufficient in food production.

In this vein, the firm has cross-planted some sweet potatoes between the
jatropha plants that can grow up to 10 meters high, but whose height will be
maintained at about 3 meters to ensure workers do not have to use cranes to pick
the diesel-bearing seed, he said.

For now, the farm produces green and red peppers, tomatoes, bananas, onions,
fresh corn-on-the-cob, cabbages, lettuce and other vegetables for the market at
Katima Mulilo.

The project has a 100-strong multi-ethnic workforce but this number will
possibly swell to thousands of employees once it attains commercial production.
