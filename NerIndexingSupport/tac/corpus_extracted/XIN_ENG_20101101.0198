Ireland's Minister for Health and Children Mary Harney on Monday approved a
major new scheme including voluntary early retirement aimed at reducing the
numbers of persons working in certain sections of the health services.

In a statement from the Department of Health and Children, Harney announced a
voluntary early retirement scheme and a voluntary redundancy scheme for certain
categories of staff working in the public health service. The funding for the
new initiative has been secured through the Department of Finance and up to 400
million euros (558 million U.S. dollars) will be provided in 2010.

"The purpose of the schemes is to achieve a permanent reduction in the numbers
employed in the public health sector from 2011 onwards and to facilitate health
service reform. The government has decided that funding of up to 400 million
euros will be made available in 2010 to fund the up-front costs of both
schemes," said the statement.

The Irish minister confirmed the schemes will be open to both management and
administrative grades, and support staff, but she said that priority will be
given to the management and administrative grades. Those wishing to avail of the
schemes must retire or resign by Dec. 30, 2010, she added.

The management of the Health Service Executive (HSE) on Monday morning informed
staff of the decision and also briefed trade union representatives.

"It is a matter for each individual employee in the grades concerned to decide
whether she or he wishes to avail of them. However, the terms on offer,
particularly given the current budgetary, are fair and reasonable. The schemes
will be available on a once-off basis to employees in the grades concerned and
will not be repeated," she said.

"The voluntary nature of the schemes means it is not possible to predict how
many individuals will avail of the schemes. Whatever the uptake is, the HSE and
health service employers will have to use the other provisions of the Croke Park
Agreement to ensure they continue to deliver services with reducing numbers."

The Croke Park Agreement is a four-year agreement (2010-2014), which includes a
pay freeze, job security and the maintenance of existing pension arrangements
for 330,000 Irish public servants. The agreement, negotiated at Croke Park,
Ireland's premier sports stadium, earlier this year with public sector unions,
means a four- year pay freeze, and commitments by the Irish government not to
implement compulsory redundancies and to maintain existing pension arrangements.
It also includes the prospect of a limited reversal of pay reductions introduced
last year.
