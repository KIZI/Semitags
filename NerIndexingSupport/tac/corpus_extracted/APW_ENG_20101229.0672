Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour has suspended the life sentences of two sisters for a 1994 armed robbery on the condition that one of the women donates a kidney to her sister.

Barbour said Wednesday that Gladys and Jamie Scott are eligible for parole in 2014, but "Jamie Scott requires regular dialysis, and her sister has offered to donate one of her kidneys to her."

Barbour said Gladys Scott's "release is conditioned on her donating one of her kidneys to her sister."

Barbour said in a news release that the parole board agreed to indefinitely suspend their sentences. The robbery netted $11.

The Scott sisters have received public support from advocacy groups, including the NAACP, which called for their release.
