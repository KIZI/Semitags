New South Wales Waratahs lock Will Caldwell will miss the entire 2011 Super 15
season to concentrate on recovering from a debilitating illness, team officials
said on Thursday.

Caldwell, 28, was struck down with Crohn’s disease following the South African
leg of the 2009 Super 14 series and has been hampered by the illness for more
than a year.

Caldwell, who with 76 appearances is the most-capped second-rower in NSW rugby
history, shed more than 20kg (44 pounds) and went on to play nine matches this
year but has never been able to fully recover from the setback.

"It’s been an extremely frustrating 18 months to say the least," Caldwell said
in a statement.

"The Crohn’s really knocked me around. I couldn’t do much at all, let alone
play footy, but I just kept working with the medical staff on trying to manage
the symptoms and do the best I could.

"I believe we’ve stayed on top of it as much as we could, but it’s become
pretty clear in the past few months that trying to battle Crohn’s and couple
it with being a professional footballer isn’t ideal."

Caldwell said rather than spend another season battling the illness he would
instead take the 2011 season off.

The lock said he did not believe it was the end of his career.

"Far from it, but this isn’t like an injury where there’s a defined period
of time and hopefully by stepping away from the game for a while I’ll be able
to come back bigger and better," he said.

Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that causes ongoing
inflammation of the intestinal tract, with symptoms including diarrhoea,
abdominal pain, fever and loss of appetite.
