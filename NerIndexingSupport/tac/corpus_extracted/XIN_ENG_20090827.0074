Australian hospitals are being encouraged to introduce a checklist to ensure
surgeons operate on the correct part of the right person, Australian Associated
Press reported on Thursday.

The World Health Organization-backed initiative has been shown to reduce
surgery-related deaths in hospitals overseas, and efforts are underway to have
the checklist introduced in Australia and New Zealand.

"There is evidence that use of this checklist can achieve significant reductions
in complications and death associated with surgical care," Royal Australasian
College of Surgeons President Ian Gough said.

"By reducing complications, this initiative may well save money ... more
importantly of course, it will save lives."

Gough said the system was like that used in aviation, which required the "pilot
and the team in the cockpit" to mutually agree that it was safe to proceed and
that "no preventable errors were about to be made".

The Surgical Safety Checklist has three phases which require a string of boxes
be ticked before anesthetic is administered, before "skin incision" and before
the patient leaves the operating room.

Initial questions include that the patient has confirmed their identity, the
operation they are going to have and on what body part.

Surgeons must also detail the "critical or unexpected steps" involved in the
procedure with their surgical team while a final question requires nurses to
confirm "instrument, sponge, needle and other counts are correct".

The trial compared the outcomes of almost 4,000 surgeries before and after the
checklist was introduced to eight participating hospitals overseas.

The death rate among surgical patients almost halved - to 0.8 percent down from
1.5 percent - after the checklist was introduced while the rate of inpatient
complications dropped from 11 percent to seven percent.
