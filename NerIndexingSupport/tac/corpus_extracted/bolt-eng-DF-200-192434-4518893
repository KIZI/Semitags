you earn a high five there
 
 
Taylor looks so hot its ridiculous
 
 
Since when did Rob hate twilight?!

Saw the trailer this morning, very excited, it looks good. Been a fan of the books for a couple of years now and I was a bit apprehensive about twilight being a film, but I thought it was excellent; so I have high hopes for this one to be the same.
 
 
meh...
why do they sound so monotone?
 
 
aw wow! this looks absolutely amazing! i can't wait for it to come out

Whenever he is interviewed about Twilight he goes on a tirade about how weird and creepy the books are, how Stephanie Meyer is mad and in love with her own creation, and how Edward is a flat, boring character. He's a good actor, it's a shame he got roped into appearing in such tripe.
 
 
ooo that was fabbylicious... Rob looks fit as.. and Taylor L. aint looking that bad either...

*Team Edward... because Jacob doesn't sparkle* aha..

All I can say is, gutted to Bella for choosing Edward over Jacob considering how he looks in the trailer.

He hints about that opinion in the commentary. Which made my opinion of him increase greatly that he could laugh at it all.
 
 
This is HILARIOUS! I could not stop laughing! Boy, I really hope this Twilight phase that's poisoning the world is over soon. Really.
 
 
When I saw this trailer last night on the MTV Movie Awards I almost **** my pants. It was amazing. Im SOOOOOOOOO excited to see it!! and stop bashing RPatz. If you want to bash anyone let it be Kristen Stewart for being a BAD actress. Ick.

  You're so right though  
 
 
They didn't follow the damn book

Spoiler:
Jacob doesn't rescue her from the vampire, Sam finds her. I hate it when films create their own storylines. I swear Bella isn't meant to know he is a wolf that early on?

And what is up with the new fashion sense from Edward.. I am not accustomed to him wearing a suit jacket over jeans.. what a random style..

Yeah that scene is a tad strange. We have been discussing this on the Twilight society

I've seen the interview. It's the truth. Although, I wouldn't use the word 'hate' to describe Rob's feelings, perhaps a bit strong.

Im glad someone agrees with me. Her acting is SOOOOOO flat. I mean I know its supposed to be espcially in this movie cuz she is all sad and **** but i mean, its just bad. Like she has NO emotion. She makes Bella like MORE awkward because she is as awkward as anybody ever is. I could make a better Bella than her, AND im black!! What does that say about Kristen Stewart?? That she SUCKS. the end!!

She constantly acts in a monotonous voice. She is bearable in her acting skills. I think that she is however perfect for the character Bella because she does come across as shy and reserved. However Rpatz is on another level  

Spoiler:
She isn't that bad though

Jasper is awesome too, though again Jackson with his normal hair is better

The guy who plays Jasper =

Bella isnt supposed to know he has changed yet, they dont even see each other because he is ignoring her -.-

Agreeeeeeeeeeeeeeed  

Twilight/New Moon could've/could been really good if they didn't have two of the most wooden actors in the entire world playing the lead roles

He's right! Twilight is a bunch of crap tbh. I was a huge fan of the books for a while until I read Breaking Dawn and realised just how awful they are (imo). The film isn't any better. But Taylor Lautner =  
 
 
Taylor Lautner looks gorgeous as ever, especially topless.  

Kristen Stewart is an awful actress. There's no emotion when she speaks!

Agreed ^^ with both. Kirsten should not be Bella at all. That is an example of casting gone very very wrong.

Also.. how fit is Taylor! *Still on team Edward..   *

kirsten stewart is always the same..
i don't get why all the boys fancy bella's character. when i first read twilight i imagined her as being really pretty, but in a quiet/natural way. hmm don't see it.

i'm not totally dissing her, it just bugs me how people are all slating robert haha
and i have never heard robert pattinson say that he doesn't like twilight. EVER.  
xo
 
 
Team Edward!!  
Still love Jacob though

I was saying that Kirsten always speaks in a monotonous voice.

I would never offend Rpatz, I love him too much  
 
 
Oh. My. Edward.
I LOVE IT! Seriously, can Novemeber come any sooner?!?!
It's amazing.
 
 
Erm...id like to act as if I'm not excited about seeing this....buuuuut....that would be a lie  
 
 
To whoever negged me, you could have left your name! And am I not allowed to have an opinion? Sheesh.

aha i know you weren't
i share your love for him  
im guessing you'll be watching the awards tonight then?   xo
 
 
Aw, when I read the title I thought it was going to be a new trailer for the film "Moon", coming out in July...
 
 
Taylor beats Robert hands down.

and   theres a twilight soc?!
 
 
Aw, I was hoping for a clip of Michael Sheen being amazing as always. No such luck.

No offence to Twilight fans, but how can you be excited over this? I know the feeling of watching a trailer for a film you're looking forward to and getting a bit hyper, but this trailer is dull dull dull.

Anyway, I only managed to watch 40 minutes of the first film before very nearly dying of boredom, but I'll have to see this because of Michael Sheen.

Why has Michael Sheen agreed to do this? He gets all his big bucks from the Underworld movies, so he needn't bother staining his reputation with balls like this.

I don't know. I was quite upset when I first found out, because when he's done films like The Queen and Frost/Nixon, he can afford to be a bit fussy, but maybe he thought it would be fun? I can't remember how much he's being paid for this, but apparently it's quite a lot, and I suppose it's not that challenging.

And to be honest, I'd rather see him do this than play Tony Blair yet again.

Everyone already knows that he's a great actor, so hopefully this won't ruin his reputation.

I guess you're right. He's Blair'ed himself to pieces somewhat. It'll be quite cringeworthy watching it though.
 
 
AHHHH So excited!
 
 
looks as lame as the last one.

I said that to my twilight mad friend and she went ape  . :L. I totally agree though. Emotion doesn't seem to be something they can portray... *awaits the wrath of the twilight fans*

Please, they both sucked big time! Edward looked like he was constantly confused and stupid and Bella was just plain boring. The books are even worse though. Do not even get me started (-help me! I just fainted because I was kissed. By a vampire boy! He's so sexy...mmmmm....-)
 
 
Whoever gave me this neg rep is pathetic:

"How about read a good book and watch a good film instead of masturbating over pathetic little pussy boys. God, I hate fangirls."

Why wont you leave your name, you coward

Lol...   I still do think that Edward was played better than Bella. Yes I did think the movie sucked and I also think the book is overrated and great authors aren't appreciated enough. The movie was worse than the book... the movie hardly matched the book! I was really looking forward to the Darren Shan movie this year - a proper vampire movie and now it is changed to 2010 and yet New Moon is already coming out this year. Makes me mad. I agree Bella is a weak character.
 
 
umm da books were Okay- twilight movie was ya... umm lets just say i was put off. But still looking forward to more of Jacob!
 
 
Not impressed with the crap about Bella knowing that Jacob is a wolf when Laurent turns up. That completely messes up the story. But Jacob looks hot now

Of course  
 
 
If you want to see a actualy watchable movie about vampires, watch Let the Right One In
 
 
Teaser trailer looked amazing until the part Jacob turns into a wolf. Boy, oh boy. That was some seriously bad special effects. Other than that, I'm so excited!  

Yes! I agree with everyone about the Bella actress; so bad it's unbelievable. Yum, Jacob..
 
 
thats out really soon, considering they didnt start filming that long ago, really, and i saw twilight in january (i think)
 
 
omfg i love you for this!!!!
taylor lautner droooools
 
 
it looks rubbish!!
so dissapointing, and like Jacobs wolf form is nooo way how i imagined, is it even how the book imagine?? o.O
 
 
I'm sure the film will be alright but for a trailer I thought this was awful. It wouldn't make me want to see it at all.
 
 
I am excited.  
 
 
the trailer is ****.

films obviously gonna ruin the book. like they always do

Positive reputation points added my good sir.
 
 
OKAY let me clear this all up before i have a fit.

FIRSTLY those who say 'omg boring!!' screw you. sorry but wtf is up with you? dont you have anything else better to do. This trailer may SEEM boring to you because you havent watched the first movie or you havent read all the books. which might look boring looking at this trailer without knowing wtf is going on. This trailer is exciting to TWILIGHT FANS because they have been waiting for this and its a really good sneak peak to see how the film is actually going to look like. it's exciting for US.

SECONDLY they haven't flipping finished shooting the movie! there's a HUGE scene which is still in the making which hasn't been added to he trailer because it isnt finished yet. therefore that is why the trailer is so simple.

THIRDLY go away and leave twilight and it's fans alone. twilight is a big success so get the hell over it.

sorry about that, NOW FOR MY OPINION!

OMG JACOB LOOKS AMAZING OMG HIS BODY IS SMOKIN' HOT.
i actually love the make up on edward and how pale he is. my friends who haven't read the book or know anything else abbout twilight found it hard to tell whether bella herself was part of the cullens because she was as pale as them! but now theyve made the cullens paler they can really tell the difference.

i loveeeee the Laurent part. i have to say Kristen looks so beautiful! Edward looks cute as usual but JACOB OH MY OH MY!!!

cant wait!!
 
 
Looks good until Taylor Lautner turns into that wolf. lol
 
 
I don't understand why there are so many people saying wow this movie is **** as if you'd like it blah blah blah.

Seriously if you don't like it, don't watch it.

I would have thought the solution was pretty simple.

The movie mediocre at best but then they changed a lot of the character stylings for it (for the better it made edward and bella tolerable)

and my friends cant understand why I don't like the series
 
 
Seriously if you hate it so much why are you wasting time posting here?!

I kinda agree with some of what Rob Pattinson is saying in that link that was posted, this is because I recognise that twilight is not perfect, and I did sometimes lol when reading the books. Having said that, I found it an enjoyable read and with an interesting storyline. I didn't find Bella's character flat at all, it was Edward's personality that bothered me - it was too perfect, I kinda thought he should have more flaws you know, so it didn't seem like a women writing about her fantasy, which yes twilight is I know. Overall it is one of my favourite books simply because I enjoyed it so much even though I recognise it's average writing style.
 
 
Looks EPIC. Jacob = DROOL.

[QUOTE=~Hazzle* I recognise that twilight is not perfect, and I did sometimes lol when reading the books. Having said that, I found it an enjoyable read and with an interesting storyline. [/QUOTE]

I do agree with this as twilight is not the best written book but it takes you on a journey. I think the books are a bit like marmite: you either love them or you hate them and i think people hate them because they cant let themseleves be taken away into the world that the author has created which is fair enough because everyone does not like everything and it would be a very boring world if we all did.
However, the movie was very disappointing in comparison to the books. Kristen Stewart's acting was appalling but I have to say i think Robert Pattinson did a good job (apart from the bit in the bio room where he looks constipated). I loved the Cullen family- i think they were perfect for the roles but the direction and script was horrendous! I must say i love Taylor Lautner though so hopefully i will enjoy New Moon more than Twilight. Sorry, if i have offended anyone but i have to say i do LOVE the books, i am just tired of the 'Twilight' craze from pre-teens around the world!
 
 
Why oh why can't people see past the franchise and see that this IS NOT A GOOD FILM and pattinson who by the way looks like he needs to do a poo through most of the scenes and Kristen can't act Stewart is not a good actress why is she getting so much credit when young actresses who are actually good get no credit at all Emily Blunt if you want an example.

I'm sorry, I vowed I wouldn't post anything about Twilight again but I just have to dispute that point. People (or me anyway) don't hate the books because they can't escape into Stephenie Meyer's world. I read the first 3 books in 3 days because I got so into it I had to read more. I dislike the books because after the initial have-to-know-what-happens feeling, it hit me just how one dimensional the characters are, how borderline stalkerish Edward is and how - sorry - abusive Bella and Edward's relationship is. Not to mention the superficiality and the purple prose overload. I don't want to offend you or fans of the books, it's great that you like them but people have plenty of better reasons to hate the books than not allowing themselves to escape. In fact, if it wasn't for the escapism/entertainment (and my need to finish a series and the hope the books would get better), I wouldn't have been able to get through them.

And before any of you start negging me, this is all just my opinion and I'm not claiming any of it is fact, it's just how I percieve the books.

And I agree with everything you said apart from the point I bolded.  

And I also love Taylor Lautner.  
 
 
hey diamonddust, i was also just expressing an opinon- it just seemed to me that the people who didnt like it didnt seem to get into it but i think your point is fair that if you analyse the writing style, the plot and the relationship in the book you would find it very flawed, however i am not that sort of person so i dont do that and so i do not destroy the feeling i felt when first reading the books. However, i do feel that i have lost my love for the book because of the crazy things that fans are now doing/saying. Also, diamonddust, you are free to express your opinon after all this is what discussions are made for- it would be quite boring if everyone agreed Twilight was the best thing since sliced bread. And once again I will state i love Taylor Lautner.
 
 
  There is no God. There's going to be 5 of them, is there not? I feel a headache coming on.
 
 
I'm a twilight newbie but I love it!
I just saw the film after hearing about all the hype and I just love it, don't know why I just do!
About to start reading the books very soon and really wanna see the new film now!!!!
