California is about to join the rest of the union -- or, at
least, the 40 other states that offer incentives for movie and
television production.

The California Film Commission will begin accepting applications
today for tax credits -- $100 million worth that will be available
each of the next five fiscal years for a limited range of
qualifying productions.

Despite the state's awful current financial condition, the
Legislature passed the $500 million program to counteract the
financial incentives offered by other states to lure production
away from Hollywood.

"Our program is different from most of the other states in that
ours is specifically targeting those types of productions that have
been leaving to seek out incentives in other regions," said film
commission director Amy Lemisch.

California's 20 percent tax breaks are being offered to feature
films with budgets of $1 million to $75 million,
made-for-television movies, miniseries and some new TV series
produced for basic cable.

The incentive goes up to 25 percent for independent features
with budgets less than $10 million and existing television series
that relocate to California from out-of-state.

Indie film producers can also transfer their tax credits to a
third party, enabling them to generate cash that could mean the
difference between going into production or not. All the other
productions will have to wait until filing their 2011 state tax
returns for their credit certificate to kick in.

While Lemisch does not believe all the first year's $100 million
will be earmarked by the close of business today, she does expect
most of the credits to be tentatively assigned fairly quickly this
summer.

So far, producers are cautiously optimistic that the program
will encourage more filming in California, though they obviously
would prefer larger and, perhaps, more immediate financial
incentives. New Mexico, for instance, offers a 25 percent,
check-in-hand tax rebate that attracted such notable productions as
"Terminator Salvation," "Wild Hogs" and "Sunshine Cleaning."

"Film and television productions have left California for tax
incentives in other states and countries for years now so the MPAA
was, of course, very supportive of the production incentives passed
in February in California," said Elizabeth Kaltman, vice president
of corporate communications for the Motion Picture Association of
America, the major studios' lobbying and rating group.

"Production tax incentives will help make California
competitive, generate jobs and much needed revenue for the state."

With the $75 million budget cap, though, how many big films they
will keep in California is debatable.

"Well, that knocks out a lot of studio movies," noted Thomas
Tull, whose Legendary Pictures co-produced such pricey action
spectaculars as "The Dark Knight" and "Watchmen."

"But we do some films that cost under that. And it would just
be great to have the option to be able to really compare apples to
apples and to stay here.

"At least this shows that the legislators' hearts are in the
right place, and I know our governor is passionate about this,"
Tull said.

Of course, even a couple of midrange studio productions could
gobble up each fiscal year's $100 million pot, which is why $10
million will be set aside each year for low-budget indies.

"Several states, like New York, have gone through a couple
hundred million dollars very quickly," said Brad Simpson, whose
indie track record includes "Far from Heaven" and "Boys Don't
Cry."

"The scary thing, in any state, is that sometimes they change
the rules when an administration or legislature changes," added
Simpson, who hopes his new company, Apparatus Productions, will be
able to shoot some upcoming projects in California -- if, as he
joked, he can ever figure out the tax credit application form.

Lemisch is confident that changing the rules won't be a problem
here.

"You'd need a two-thirds vote to do any changes at this point,
so I feel fairly certain that we're going to be quite stable for
five years," she said.

Some local film commissions are also doing what they can to
sweeten the pot.

"It's a huge step in the right direction," said Jessica Freude
of the Santa Clarita Film Office, which has $150,000 worth of
permit- and tax-waiving incentives taking effect today.

"More than anything, if we can still offer an extremely
talented work force here in Southern California, which we have, and
still have some great, film-friendly communities and businesses, it
only strengthens our position as a great place to film."

The CFC's Lemisch is as optimistic as she can be that the state
incentives will not only prove a boon to Hollywood, but to
California as a whole.

"I'd like to think that this program will be so effective that
we will help the state recover," she said. "I think all the
producers should apply; we're not turning anybody away yet!"
