From any perspective, it is without doubt that Taiwan is not part of China and that the oppressive tactics employed in forcing Taiwan to reunify is just simply wrong. Not much surpise there it being China: communist ideals, total disregard for democracy, and appalling human-rights record. List of runs long. However what is most disappointing is the attitude, actions or lack of it of the International community.

Why are the governments of the free and democratic world so obliging towards Communist China? Is it acceptable to trade integrity, morals and beliefs for economic or other benefits? May I cite the U.N. as an example where China has been pressing Haiti to cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan as a condition to approving a lengthy extension of the U.N. peacekeeping force in the Caribbean nation? Prior to his departure, Port-au-Prince had asked Taipei to send a lower-ranking official due to the Chinese government's threat that if Premier Su were allowed into Haiti, Beijing would use its influence at the U.N. to block the deployment of peacekeeping forces to Haiti. Has the U.N. become a tool for China to manipulate others with? One just has to recall the case of Macedonia back in 1999 where China abused its veto power to kill off a UN Security Council resolution to retain peace-keeping forces patrolling Macedonias borders after it opened diplomatic ties with Taiwan. Time again and without consideration of the real purpose of the resolution at hand, China has used the U.N. as a tool to manipulate other nations to support its oppression. What does this show about the UN and its credibility?

Taiwanese defiance of China's ambition to "liberate" the island symbolizes the general struggle for a world where people are free from oppression. Forget history and political parties; forget the tautological cultural and ethnic theories for and against unification or independence. The story of China and Taiwan is about what humans value in a society and how humans resolve their differences. Quoting an article in the Taipei Times by Jonathan Hwang (jurist doctor candidate at Harvard Law School), people should ask themselves, what do we humans value? Do we particularly value joining another's society or forming our own independent society? From this, we realize what we truly value as humans: freedom. That is the freedom to choose how we live and attain happiness in peace with fellow humans. The struggle for freedom is being played out between China and Taiwan.

Ultimately, what is important is not the matter of whether Taiwan is independent or part of China. What matters is how the outcome is reached. Is unification imposed on the people of Taiwan through threats of violence? Or is unification decided by the freewill of the Taiwanese? Humanity should share appreciation for individual freedom and respect one another's exercise and enjoyment of it. This reinforces President Chens statement that Taiwan's sovereignty belongs to its 23 million people and only they have the right to decide on the future of Taiwan. The Chinese are free to disagree should the people of Taiwan choose to be independent, but they must respect it or risk violating the freedom of the Taiwanese to choose their destiny.

At the heart of it all, Taiwan should matter because freedom matters. As such, the issue of independence or unification is purely a Taiwanese matter. But it should also be the concern of the world where every country should play a more active role in support of the freedom to choose. Humanity has seen enough of authoritarianism, where oppressive governments choke the free spirit of humanity. This is why Taiwan matters and why free countries and free peoples should not turn a blind eye towards China's blatant aggression.

Is it acceptable to trade integrity, morals and beliefs for economic or other benefits
 

You made some sense, but about this quote. There was a person who wrote a autobiography, he was living in a war and had a little sister, if he gave up his belief and integrity and simply accepted help from a old lady in exchange for doing lowly chores, then his sister would've lived the war and survived to the end of the war when relief efforts came. Then he probably wouldn't have written the autobiography as a apology to his sister. My point is, what's the point of risking other people's lives for your morals and integrity. If a nation has starving people, the wisest thing to do is seek the best economic option to feed them.
 
 
Just wondering who's dumb idea was it to take the un veto power away from nationalist china (tiawan) and give it to communist china anyway? and who let that go through.
 
 
Taiwan is a part of China, it just doesn't recognize the communist government in Beijing. If the ChiComs ever fall and a democratic government comes to power, you'll probably see Taiwan rejoin in short order.
 
 
I highly doubt it. I don't doubt that there will be negotiations and eventual re-unification but the process would be hard and exacting on both sides. The reason being that Taiwan has alot more to lose than to gain. Taiwan is right now a defacto country. 1.2 billion Mainland voices will drown out 25 million Taiwan voices no matter what government is in charge.
 
 
maxor,

that would be the US. also, not having 1 billion chinese represented at the UN is a bit funny, no?

This compells me to propose, that considering the governments of Taiwan and PRC and their respective inclinations to listen to their peoples, that a GREATER number of Chinese would be truly represented had the seat remained with Taiwan.

After all, the ROC government IS duly elected by a vote of the people, the PRC is not.
 
 
horrido,

governments are voted in either by the bullet or by the ballot.

regarding how many people "voted" in the KMT regime in taiwan in that time period...that's the funniest thing i've heard all week. the KMT, all the way up until the late 1980s, was a fascist organization. had you proposed that "taiwan" had a seat in the UN in 1972...when you were in taiwan...you most likely would have been 'disappeared'.  
 
 
 
horrido,

Which legitimizes PRC rule how, not being by the ballot?

I'm well aware of the ROC's dictatorial history, notice how I quantified the post with "would" and "remained". And why would the KMT be upset with me advocating their greater role in the UN circa 1972? I would also be keen to point out a greater fraction of PRC political undesirables would be under greater threat than their ROK equivalents. What percentage of the populace were imprisoned, murdered, or died of starvation during the Cultural Revolution?

if it was not legitimate, the CCP would all be hanging from lamp-posts by now...or chased out to an island.

because for the KMT, there was no such thing as TAIWAN the nation. taiwan is merely the waypoint and springing ground for the glorious day the KMT liberates the rest of china from the communist bandits currently giving a temporary "administration" to the mainland. to say otherwise, and to acknowledge that there is such a thing as a pitiful "island nation", is to be defeatist and traitorous.  

also, why are you using ROK? ROK is the republic of korea, aka south korea.

finally...let's put it this way. the KMT ruled china from around 1928 to 1946. in that time period, millions starved to death, were "disappeared", or shot, or hung from lamp-posts. in taiwan, they had no compunction about rounding up and murdering over 20K of taiwanese natives over the space of a day to underscore their own power (2/28/1947).

but to be sure, you are right, the commies did all that too. in fact, their own special combination of terror and retarded policies, killed an order higher number of chinese.

yet from 1949 till now, it has retained its legitimacy, and hasn't been chased away, or overthrown. in fact, the CCP now probably holds a greater level of legitimacy vis-a-vis the populace than at any level since the 1950s.

why?

i'm asking this as more than just a rhetorical question, but as something political scientists have to deal with. for example, we'd call the US government in the 1850s a legitimate state, for example, despite laws that kept a significant portion of its populace in slavery. and that until the 1960s had significant restrictions on who could or could not participate in the voting process.
 
 
[QUOTE=astralis;356543]horrido,

It isn't legitimate. And they WOULD be hanging fromlamp-posts if the populace were able to arm themselves, or have we forgotten Tiananmen Square and the manic use of APCs, machine guns, and grenades to clear unarmed civilians?

Chiang Kai-shek screwed up, and failed to inact necessary reforms before being stuck on Taiwan, and Mao was charismatic and driven enough to push his big lie on the unsuspecting populace who had no known comparison, alternative, or clue as to what was before them. If only they knew then what we all know now.

I like that. It would warm my heart for the ROC to protest vehemently over Russian interference in "Chinese internal affairs" whenever they deliver Russian arms to the PRC.  

 
also, why are you using ROK? ROK is the republic of korea, aka south korea.
 

Typo, my bad. I know well the difference. I'm used to writing "ROK" more frequently than "ROC". Consider it a "Howard Hughes" repetitive motion OCD moment.  

Though, come to think of it, we DID see China try to "liberate" the ROK, too.

A large government controlled military verses a helpless unarmed populace who by their very historical and cultural nature and traditions are loath to question or rebel against authority? But I'm sure Confucious would be more succinct and poetic.

Slaves weren't citizens, they were property. Are you saying that residents of the PRC slaves because they cannot vote? I would say that post-slavery/pre-civil rights movement blacks still had greater rights in the US than citizens of the PRC.

The students at Tianamen never had popular support. Else, those CCP members would have hung from lamp posts. You're not bringing up the fact that the youth of China was unleashed once and the results was the Great Proliterate Cultrual Revolution and it took a Civil War before the PLA crushed the Red Guards. If the populace was armed, they would have turned the guns on the students at Tianamen.

Also, no country in the world has recognized the CCP's actions at Tianamen to be illegal.

An interesting statement regarding civil antagonism towards the students, as reports I'm familiar with indicate the majority of the casualties were from non-student locals massing outside of Tianamen square.

And how is opening fire on and driving armor over unarmed civilians legal, foreign government recognition or not? I wouldn't expect countries to come out against it, considering the vast majority, including the US and UK, have opened up and killed unarmed civilians in protest situations, as well.

Sir, I am reading the memoir of James Lilly, the US Ambassador to China during 1989 and he says that the students were joined by workers, teachers, peasants and other civilians.....

 
Also, no country in the world has recognized the CCP's actions at Tianamen to be illegal.
 

Then what about the arms embargo by US and EU....

And they were... within Beijing. And this was seen before, at the death of Zhou En-Lai. It was not that the students had support (to start a civil war?) but that they opened a flood gate.

The turning point in support was when the students started to dictate to the CCP on National TV. "We're not here to listen to you. We're here to tell you what to do."

I guess your are right. It seems that the students were very disrespectful to Li Peng. Especially the Wuer Kiaxi guy who was dressed in pajamas and he even scolded Li Peng for being late to the meeting....
 
 
I have a question for the China Hands here...

Did Taiwan(KMT) ever think of establishing relationship with USSR apart from the period before 1945?
 
 
 
Then what about the arms embargo by US and EU....

 

That was a diplomatic issue, not a legal one.

Kinda hard to do when Mao was invited to Moscow by Stalin.

667medic,

why would the KMT do that, and jeopardize the very significant levels of aid that the US was providing?

I was just wondering whether it could have been some kind of a pressure tactic because some of the clause of diplomatic recognition of China involved the future supply of weapons to Taiwan. Sorry for the dumb question anyway

what colonel yu said. what many outsiders fail to comprehend was that 6/4 was not a national movement. the big contention among people at that time period were corruption, inflation, and also more desire for civil liberties. sure, there was a desire for political liberties, as well, but that was a distant fourth place. the CCP, especially under zhao ziyang, had some inclination to negotiate, but when the more moderate students started to leave, the extremist die-hards remaining effectively hijacked the movement, putting political liberty at the forefront. this last demand the CCP would not countenance, and it so happens that this last demand was also the least desired from the populace. that is part of the reason why the CCP crushed the movement as it did: it was fairly certain that in doing so, the rest of the country would not go up in arms against them for it.

 
Chiang Kai-shek screwed up, and failed to inact necessary reforms before being stuck on Taiwan, and Mao was charismatic and driven enough to push his big lie on the unsuspecting populace who had no known comparison, alternative, or clue as to what was before them. If only they knew then what we all know now.
 

actually, more than a few people knew what the communist era would mean, given that mao and the CCP had far from clean hands in the 1930s. however, many people accepted this as the price for china being able to hold a respectable position in the world- something which CKS was never able to do, despite his 17 years as the ostensible Big Man in china.

garn, so no taiwanese independence for you

haha, you've fallen for the very myth that the CCP (and many other asians, like lee kuan yew) like to talk about : the myth of the gentle, docile populace whom follow authority unquestioningly for the sake of the community. nothing could be further from the truth. you're talking about a people whose civil wars dwarfed anything the west ever saw. whom hold rebellions and civil revolts so commonly that it is indeed rare for 50 years to go by without a particularly bloody rebellion (and by bloody, usually numbers in the hundreds of thousands or millions dead).

that the CCP has been able to pull this off, and in the last thirty years raised more people from poverty than any country in the history of the world...could be worse, as chinese often say.

 
I would say that post-slavery/pre-civil rights movement blacks still had greater rights in the US than citizens of the PRC.
 

an interesting comparison. if you were a black living in the south, that would not be true. if you were a black living in the north...maybe. then again, a black person living in the north had probably less political influence, just by lack of numbers.
 
 
667medic,

i think the US would have seen through that bluff pretty fast. a bit hard to transfer arms from the USSR to taiwan, i'd imagine  

also, by the late 70s, taiwanese political leaders were recognizing that their authoritarian position on the island was no longer tenable, given the rising economic conditions and political awareness of the people. it was during the late 70s time-period that there were intraparty discussions on how to ease taiwan into something approximating a democracy, with the hope that if the KMT was in charge of this process, it would be able to dominate the elections thusly. so again, not sure if the USSR would have liked what it saw...

this is what people don't really see. They had a lot of support, because people went to support these students for fun. It's hard to think that they would do it now. But back in the days, it was like a big party outside of TianAnMen square. There were not that many really committed to the cause. And even when you look at the leaders from that movement, only Wang Dan has followed up the democratic cause in China after that.

while I agree with a lot of your points, I do have to say that China will hold this attitude toward Taiwan regardless of whether or not the communists are in power.
 
 
OoE,

The CCP actions in 1989 were indeed viewed as illegal and resulted in an arms embargo that continues to this day.

Taiwan will remain free only so long as the US remains willing to safeguard it's indipendance. This will change one of two ways. The PRC gains military supremacy or can buy off the US vis a vis debt relief.

Both the US and China (both of them) know that the US debt will reach a point where war with the PRC or federal insolvency will be the only cures. The US despite being peace loving, is also very miltiant. It is in the PRC's interest to forgive this debt in trade for US non-involvement. The only other solution is for Taiwan to decide to re-unify voluntarily before this can be realized.

I bleeive the PRC is pursuing both roads. Increased ties with Taiwan on eone hand and a military build up on the other so that regardless of what happens they have options to use.
 
 
 
OoE,

Under what statue? Martial Law was declared. And the UNSC could never bring charges to declare the action illegal due to the Chinese veto.
 
 
 
My comment was in reference to China in general and not just Beijing.

How marvelously convenient. Maybe other governments should take note, declare perpetual martial law, and that way they won't have to worry about those pesky civil rights laws that make enforcing the whims of the government so problematic? It begs me to ask what forms of destruction the protestors were levelling on persons, property, and transport?

 
The turning point in support was when the students started to dictate to the CCP on National TV. "We're not here to listen to you. We're here to tell you what to do."
 

Oh, dear, a government of the people, by the people, and for the people! How unreasonably absurd. We must assuredly stamp-out such endeavors!  

 
but when the more moderate students started to leave, the extremist die-hards remaining effectively hijacked the movement, putting political liberty at the forefront.
 

Which is why I don't wholly blame the PRC government, as the students really should have known when to quit while they were ahead, given thanks for any reforms, kept their heads down working quietly and diligently, and come back in a few years time to push for more.

 
garn, so no taiwanese independence for you
 

I see no reason for Taiwan to forego it's connection with China, I just don't want them subjugated under PRC control. Once the PRC meets or exceeds Taiwan's standards for democracy and civil rights, by all means, Taiwan should come back into the fold.

 
haha, you've fallen for the very myth that the CCP (and many other asians, like lee kuan yew) like to talk about : the myth of the gentle, docile populace whom follow authority unquestioningly for the sake of the community. nothing could be further from the truth. you're talking about a people whose civil wars dwarfed anything the west ever saw. whom hold rebellions and civil revolts so commonly that it is indeed rare for 50 years to go by without a particularly bloody rebellion (and by bloody, usually numbers in the hundreds of thousands or millions dead).

Is it a myth? They may have had civil wars, but even between those smaller kingdoms the populace was subjugated and for all intents and purposes, enslaved by one brutal warlord after another intimidating the population to do his bidding. If it was rare for 50 years to go without a rebellion, then does that not indicate that the populace simply reached the point that death was preferable to the subjugation they were under, yet consistently failed to replace it with anything stable and satisfying. As my cousin and history professor once stated,"Revolutions do not come from people that have nothing; revolutions come from people that have been given something, and had it taken away." What were the people given, and who attempted to take it away?

Has the CCP been able to pull it off? The starvation and killings of the cultural revolution, Tiananmen Square, other, smaller riots and protests crushed that never make the news? Have they really raised more people from poverty? There may have been improvements from the "could be worse" previous standard, but looking at Taiwan, Korea, Japan, and the crushed infrastructure of post WW II Europe, clearly they could have done much better, much faster adopting those systems of government, industry, and commerce.

And that's the problem, regardless of society or government, those involved often lose sight of moderating and achieving their goals with best possible efficiency, and instead decide it's a social party to have fun, and attempt to see how far they can get away with their shinanigans, often to disasterous results. They forego discipline for selfish entertainment.

The Chinese already have that on the books called Counter-revolutionary Activities. It is therefore an extraordinary event even by Chinese standards that Martial Law was declared.

 
It begs me to ask what forms of destruction the protestors were levelling on persons, property, and transport?

 

You're joking me! Occupation of the square. Denial of access by government officials including health and sanitation officials into and around the square. Physical harm to CCP supporters and personnel, including police.

 
Oh, dear, a government of the people, by the people, and for the people! How unreasonably absurd. We must assuredly stamp-out such endeavors!

 

The last time such words were uttered and yes, "The People" were exactly those words, it turn into a civil war between the PLA and the Red Guards. I'll let you guess which side the Populace chosed.

 
Have they really raised more people from poverty?

The examples you've listed got one very big advantage over China - American money and knowhow.
 
 
Probably one incident which weighed in heavily was the Gorbachev's visit and the humiliating manner in which he had to enter Great Hall of People through the back entrance....
 
 
Isn't this exaggerating China's aggression, currently China is trying to get Taiwan back through economical means.
 
 
 
I highly doubt it. I don't doubt that there will be negotiations and eventual re-unification but the process would be hard and exacting on both sides. The reason being that Taiwan has alot more to lose than to gain. Taiwan is right now a defacto country. 1.2 billion Mainland voices will drown out 25 million Taiwan voices no matter what government is in charge.

 

Largely agree with your opinion.

The eventual re-unification will be in the far away future. By then, both sides will realize that re-unification is a win-win situation.

According to today’s unification proposal, there will be no one government in charge for everyone at least in the initial period of unification.

Hong Kong and Macau are not under direct central government administration after they reunited with mainland according to Basic Law of Hong Kong and Basic Law of Macau.

For Taiwan, they will be allowed to even have her own military. The unification will be a loose union type country with a common symbolic union council.

According to Basic Law of Hong Kong, by 2008, the first transition phase end, Hong Kong has the right to choose the voting method to select their government administration and government executives by popular votes from every Hong Kong citizen. If they choose to do so by voting, by 2012, they will start the vote. A time table has been set up by the Basic Law of Hong Kong created in 1997.

If one day, Taiwan and mainland agree to unit with each other, there will be a Basic Law of Taiwan or even a set of Basic Laws for mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau.

I was a college student in Beijing in 1989 and attended most events during that period. The height of entire event started from April 15 and ended at June 5 morning. We stopped school and attend demonstrations in Tiananmen Square. I was among the ones who were pushed out of Tiananmen Square in June 5 morning by the army. When I returned school, I was reported to attend the counter-revolutionary activities and got into a studying group to "realize our problems". By this time, Chinese people had the experience of culture revolution, no one really serious about accusing the students and we all claimed that we realized our problem, then the studying group ended.

The funny thing was that the pictures shown millions of people demonstrated in Beijing but the final statistics shown very few attended real demonstration except for the organizers. All others were treated to be bystanders and let pass.

As a witness of the event in 1989, I have written several comments about that event in this forum.

The back ground of that event was the economic failure of China in her early premature economic reform. As early as 1986, the sign of economic failure had shown up. Inflation accelerated since 1986. By 1989, Chinese yuan although pegged with US$ for 1$ = 5~6 yuan by government, the black market price soared to more than 1$=10~12 yuan. Price of every thing increased substantially. People run to shop buy anything. Today, we still remember that even the broken TV and refrigerator could be sold. The lives of ordinary people became very tough in very short period. It was the economic failure that established the stage for a revolt.

The economic difficulty caused bitter debates in the government about how to find a way out. Continuing to reform with some modification is one; continuing to reform with drastic measure (shock therapy) is another one; going back to the planned economy is yet another one.

After all, the economic difficulty was caused by the two trick economic systems, a chaotic rapid development of capitalistic economy and a vast planned state own economy. Both competing for the limited resource and energy and caused inflation to soar.

At that time, the capitalistic economy with high efficient was too small to support the Chinese economy and employment. Their efficiency made them capable to push the raw material and energy price to soar. The state own economy was low efficiency but supporting the major Chinese economy and employment. The soared raw material and energy price pushed them to bankrupt. Therefore, government had to set up two trick price system for raw material and energy as well as limit the opening of certain fields to the capitalistic economy to protect the state owned economy. Higher price for capitalistic economy and lower price for state owned economy. Two trick system as well as the two trick price system were the perfect systems for government corruption. Government corruption has becoming rampant since then.

The naïve demanding of democracy from students (they thought that democracy meant that they could command government); plus the huge percentage of people were angry to the economic failure and government corruption; plus the rich people who just got their wealth from capitalistic economy wanted more power; plus the government power struggle between different opinions and branches tried to use student movement for their advantage; plus the ultra right wing Hong Kong parties tried to use the student blood to block the Hong Kong’s returning China in 1997.

Nearly two months, hundred of thousands students lived on the Tiananmen Square, every day, people send food, water, shelter to Tiananmen Square, most money came from ultra right wing Hong Kong parties. When the students wanted to make compromise to withdraw from Tiananmen Square, the ultra right wing Hong Kong parties insisted students to stay and accused the decision of leaving was betraying the democracy. They pushed for a final bloody result and hoped that the blood will cause the Hong Kong citizen to revolt for against returning to China.

Fortunately, after that bloody page of Chinese history, China continued to reform with some modification, drasticly reduced the starting up of new projects and controlled overheated economy. Chinese economy got a soft landing. China didn’t go back and didn’t adopt “shock therapy”.

During the height of Tiananmen event period, USSR leader Gorbachev visited Beijing. He must have been very impressed with what was happening in Beijing.

2 years later, USSR started a drastic disintegration type democracy and adopted “shock therapy”. A superpower collapsed. Poor Russians traded their bread for voting right. They got more right and freedom but less bread with more Vodka. God bless Russians.
 
 
 
Isn't this exaggerating China's aggression, currently China is trying to get Taiwan back through economical means.

 

Though China wants to get Taiwan in peaceful way as they said..we can not get tha fact that over hundreds of missiles are positioning towards Taiwan and that is an obviously a sort of threat..
 
 
[QUOTE=Horrido;356568][QUOTE=astralis;356543]horrido,

if it was not legitimate, the CCP would all be hanging from lamp-posts by now...or chased out to an island.  
 
It isn't legitimate. And they WOULD be hanging fromlamp-posts if the populace were able to arm themselves, or have we forgotten Tiananmen Square and the manic use of APCs, machine guns, and grenades to clear unarmed civilians?
 

I am living in China and I don't believe that people would like to do anything that is revolutionary. In fact, I have no doubt that CCP today got majority Chinese people on her side although we are angry with her corruption. We hope to get more freedom but we also understand that the stabel political situation may be important. We want a controlled slow transformation toward democracy not an overnight change like USSR to Russia.

CCP has started all kind of social reform and is starting limited political reform. The economic reform is amazingly successful.

Overwhelmingly, people feel life was rapidly improved and will continue to improve. For a poor country, China reached 99% elementary school enrollment and 95% junior high enrollment. China has almost the longest expected life span among the countries with similar per capital GDP.

A social security system has been established in cities and is improving. The similar system is establising in countrysides.

CCP is a strong goverment and is functioning. My parents live on the goverment pension and even get increase against inflation.

 
Slaves weren't citizens, they were property. Are you saying that residents of the PRC slaves because they cannot vote? I would say that post-slavery/pre-civil rights movement blacks still had greater rights in the US than citizens of the PRC.

 

I don’t agree that post-slavery/pre-civil rights movement blacks had greater rights in the US than citizens of the PRC.

Blacks could not go to white school; blacks could only sit in black/color area on a bus. I think that you still remember Little Rock Central High and Rose Parks.

Even today, please come to visit Chinese people in Beijing or any places in China. Then, go to visiting Blacks in west Detroit or some areas in New Orleans, Chicago, New York or DC if you are brave enough to go there. When I was studying in USA, people warned me not go to those places.

Even today, after the civil right movement started half century ago, I am not sure if those blacks are living in a better condition than the Chinese although USA per capital GDP is 17 times higher than that of China.
 
 
 
The height of entire event started from April 15 and ended at June 5 morning.
 

Okay, on that note, I fold my argument. After six weeks of squating on the place, I would have rolled over them, too.
 
 
Hi guys. Sorry for being "inactive" considering I started this post but I was on vacation in islands of Langkawi. Beautiful islands, great trip except that I was had 3 sea urchin spikes in my arm. Anyway, I do have some points I would like to make.
 
 
 
My point is, what's the point of risking other people's lives for your morals and integrity.

 

Hi wkllaw, point taken. However, we live in a globalised world. Eg. When one country faces a crisis, aid pours in from all around the world. Don't tell me that those countries providing aid does not have people living in poverty?

 
If a nation has starving people, the wisest thing to do is seek the best economic option to feed them.

 

Besides, China isn't a major consumer. Our companies invest in your country, creating jobs, economic activity etc. You guys are benefitting from our investments. Does this help the poor in our countries? NOOOO!!! More factories are being relocated to China cos of cheap cheap labour and there are actually less jobs going around for us. Who the poeple being fed here? Rich gets richer poor gets poorer.

One more thing, the governments of the free world before seizing power would build their election campaign around morals, integrity, and social values. I may be starving, and the easiest way for me to feed myself or my family is to sell drugs. Does it mean it's ok for me to take this economic option?
 
 
 
Taiwan is a part of China, it just doesn't recognize the communist government in Beijing. If the ChiComs ever fall and a democratic government comes to power, you'll probably see Taiwan rejoin in short order.

 

Hi BenRoethig, May I ask how is Taiwan part of China? If you are referring to the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) that came from China, then yes they were from China. But Taiwan? Never!!!

Below is part of an article posted in the Taipei Times dated Feb 12 2007:

In the past. the KMT and the CCP have been competing with each other to win the right to represent China in the international community. Both sides have regarded themselves as the only legitimate representative of China. Today, the international community recognizes the government of the PRC as the only legitimate government of China. But this does not mean the PRC can can assert sovereignty over the Taiwan's territory.

First, the ROC refers to the Chiang regime (KMT), which had no legal claim to sovereignty over Taiwan's territory.

Second, after the signing of the San Francisco Peace Treaty on Sept. 8, 1951, Taiwan's sovereignty automatically passed to the Taiwanese people, but the Chiang regime deprived them of that right until the 10 Additional Articles of the Constitution were promulgated on May 1, 1991, during the administration of former president Lee Teng-hui (李登輝).

Through that amendment, the ROC government handed back sovereignty over Taiwan to the Taiwanese people and Taiwan legally speaking became a new state.

In other words, Taiwan is a de jure independent nation.

Even if you wanna refer back to the Ching Dynasty where China did occupy Taiwan for a few short years, but then China itself where being occupied by the Manchus which after it's fall, Taiwan was transfered to Japan and after Japan, technically it is the US. Too long to post, pls read up on your facts and history.
 
 
hi huaqiao,

then what do you say to all those people who vote KMT? you gonna say they're not taiwanese either? kick 'em "back" to china (even though most of them are native-born taiwanese now)?

oops, there went most of taipei and the north...come to think of it, a lot of kaoshiung, too....  
 
 
 
Has the CCP been able to pull it off? The starvation and killings of the cultural revolution, Tiananmen Square, other, smaller riots and protests crushed that never make the news? Have they really raised more people from poverty? There may have been improvements from the "could be worse" previous standard, but looking at Taiwan, Korea, Japan, and the crushed infrastructure of post WW II Europe, clearly they could have done much better, much faster adopting those systems of government, industry, and commerce.

 

To this I would like to add that China's military budget will rise 14.7% this year to $35.3 billion. Chinese officials have claimed that it is purely defense although no countries are of any threat to them. How lame can a reason get? How stupid do they think the rest of the world are? $35b !!!! imagine what this money can do for the majority of the Chinese that are not enjoying the economic boom of the East coast?

China's leaders have announced that they do not plan to allow democracy in the next 100 years because they must focus on economic development. I'm sorry, did I hear "economic development"? More like, military development to conquer foreign economies.
 
 
 
Though China wants to get Taiwan in peaceful way as they said..we can not get tha fact that over hundreds of missiles are positioning towards Taiwan and that is an obviously a sort of threat..

 

The figure has actually passed the thousand mark. So i guess you can say it's much much more than "sort of threat".
 
 
 
Largely agree with your opinion.

The eventual re-unification will be in the far away future. By then, both sides will realize that re-unification is a win-win situation.

 

Whether it is re-unification or just plain forced take-over is still a subjective issue. But Through recent and not-so-recent historical facts, unification is just China unlawfully conquering Taiwan much like how Japan conquered parts of China, UNLESS unification is the choice of the people of Taiwan. And of course the decision not being under threat.

 
According to todays unification proposal, there will be no one government in charge for everyone at least in the initial period of unification.

Hong Kong and Macau are not under direct central government administration after they reunited with mainland according to Basic Law of Hong Kong and Basic Law of Macau.

For Taiwan, they will be allowed to even have her own military. The unification will be a loose union type country with a common symbolic union council.

According to Basic Law of Hong Kong, by 2008, the first transition phase end, Hong Kong has the right to choose the voting method to select their government administration and government executives by popular votes from every Hong Kong citizen. If they choose to do so by voting, by 2012, they will start the vote. A time table has been set up by the Basic Law of Hong Kong created in 1997.

If one day, Taiwan and mainland agree to unit with each other, there will be a Basic Law of Taiwan or even a set of Basic Laws for mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau.

 

This of course being only on the surface. My Hong Kong friends tell me that the administration is actually a Beijing-installed puppet government. Though I'm not very familiar with this issue, I do remember it being aired on CNN. However, it is not beyond doubt that it will end if and once they are able to con the Taiwanese people into believing thier puppet show.

How do you believe a government that does not grant its people basic rights? That censors anything non-propagandist? That claims more than 80% of the world's execution rate and have the world's worst human rights record? Again, the list runs loooooooong.......
 
 
 
The naïve demanding of democracy from students (they thought that democracy meant that they could command government); plus the huge percentage of people were angry to the economic failure and government corruption; plus the rich people who just got their wealth from capitalistic economy wanted more power; plus the government power struggle between different opinions and branches tried to use student movement for their advantage; plus the ultra right wing Hong Kong parties tried to use the student blood to block the Hong Kongs returning China in 1997.

 

People demanding an end to corruption, better living or thier god-given rights are not naive at all. It seems to me that you are the one that's naive. Governments are here to serve the poeple. That's why they are also known as public servants. Thus, they should be choosen by the people through elections. And if they are not doing a good job then the people have every right to criticise them (just like in Taiwan). There is no way to defend the CCP's actions for the Tiananmen massacre. The govenrment cannot kill its people just because they are not conformist.

 
2 years later, USSR started a drastic disintegration type democracy and adopted shock therapy. A superpower collapsed. Poor Russians traded their bread for voting right. They got more right and freedom but less bread with more Vodka. God bless Russians.

 

Try to see the big picture. A democratic system doesn't mean the government doesn't give a **** about you. The government still serves the people as they still do pay tax and they can be replaced through election if they are not doing a good job.The Russians did not trade thier bread. If they are hungry, it is because corruption is still rampant in the government much like the Chinese government.

Are you saying that Chinese people is now prosperous and without suffering? You may be among the lucky minority benefitting from the opening of the 5 (if not mistaken) special economic zones but look further in at your brothers and sisters which makes up the majority. At least the Russians got thier voting right because poor Chinese got no rights no freedom and still no bread not to mention vodka or 糯米酒.

I am not surpise that you and probably most Chinese feel and think this way. But you must see that what you only know is what the CCP wants you to know. It may not necessarily be true. It is being hammered into your head like brainwashing. It's propaganda.

I do not deny that an increasing number of Chinese are prospering economically. This is the job of any government but are the CCP not the ones with the real gains? It seems like a monarch system where the CCP are kings and the people are the public servants.

 
CCP has started all kind of social reform and is starting limited political reform. The economic reform is amazingly successful.

CCP is a strong goverment and is functioning. My parents live on the goverment pension and even get increase against inflation.

 

REALLY!!???

What rights do you have now? Freedom of speech? Freedom of religion? Why are you and the other 1 billion + people allowed access only to CCP approved information/news etc. Why is the internet censored and many websites blocked in your country? Why are even journalists imprisoned/tortured/executed? AGAIN, list runs long.... too looooong. Any reform should start with transparency but the CCP has too much to hide from its own people and the rest of the world.

The Chinese people has a long and humiliating history of being suppressed, more recently by Europeans and then Japanese. But now you are still being suppressed and worst of all is that it is by another group of Chinese, the CCP. I don't live in my ancestral land but even in a foreign land, I know that I have rights and freedom and don't live under suppression.

Hi Hi,

If you read the original post, you would know that I am trying to stay neutral as far as Taiwan is concern. My point is that the future of Taiwan should be left to the people of Taiwan without the threat of invasion by thier barbaric neighbours. And as a symbol of freedom it does concern the rest of the free world. The aim of this thread was to get opinions of what the rest of the world could do about it although it somehow deviated into issues void of the purpose.

Even though my mother is Taiwanese, I'm not so I'm not one of the 23 mil people who has the sole right to decide the fate of Taiwan. Sure I would love the world to recognise that Taiwan was/is an independent country but that is not my right to ask. But as a citizen of the free and democratic world, I ask these countries and its people to help let Taiwan decide for itself.

It is a fact that the KMT came from China. It is also a fact that many of them today are Taiwan-born. I am definately NOT going to say they are not Taiwanese. Of course I hope they wake up and see that the KMT is trying to sell out the country (different issue) but ultimately if the majority of Taiwanese opts for unification then I along with the rest of the world must respect and accept. What I'm trying to say is that if they choose otherwise, the same acceptance and respect must be observed.

HuaQiao,

First, you didn't read my comments and the comments from other knowledgeable people in this thread carefully.

Second, you are talking things that you didn't attend and you are not familiar with. Most of your comments are empty slogans that don't enrich anyone here.

Third, you didn't know that it is impossible to avoid corruptions in a huge country like China and Russia during their transformations.

Fourth, you should know corruptions even happen in a democratic Taiwan.

Yes, the unification should wait until most people in Taiwan agree to do so. Mainland China should wait for it.

But choosing to be independent needs approval from the international community especially from mainland China considering their historic connections.

If you understand international laws, then, you should know that the independence of any regions in the world, such as Kosova, Iraq Kurds area, South Ossetia and many more can't determined by the popular votes of local people. It needs approval from the international community, especially the world powers.

You are asking the opinion and help of the international community. But it was this international community that determined the rules that prohibit the self determination of independence of any regions in the world. Otherwise, any minority regions in the world could declare independence.

KMT is trying to sell out their country? Do you know what the heck you are talking about? KMT is trying to keep the status quo and maintain their de facto independence. This is supported by 60% of the Taiwanese population. DPP, on the other hand, has nothing but scandals. It got re-elected as the fall out from a fake assassination attempt. Now, Chen Shui-Bian has corruption charges against him. Not a model of good governance, is it?

They also raised their education spend by over 40% and their rural health care by over 80%. They got 25% more in terms of tax revenue this past year compared to the previous. Their most recent spending increase is as expected. So, please.... stop...

a lot of Chinese people are prospering. The city of Shanghai is just as spectacular as New York. China does have rural elections and is about to have municipal elections in the very near future.

Hi Zeng_xinren,

I have read your comments and those of others and which I still maintain are valid points. I may not have been there during the Tiananmen Massacre or other events but you should know that elsewhere in the world, we have much much more access to information and from various sources. Whereas in China, all information is monitored, controlled, censored or manipulated from the population. I posted a comment relating to human rights on BBS.Chinadaily and it was removed within 2 mins. So may I ask how enriching can your comments be?

I do not deny that corruption occurs everywhere in the world. Yes even in Taiwan, even in my own country or the US. Difference is even the highest ranking officials must answer to the law and his/her people. I don't see President Chen ordering the military to kill the red protestors or run over them with tanks when they disrupt the 10/10 celebrations. President Bush is heavily criticised by his own people for the war in Iraq. Does he start he censoring any information relating to Iraq allowing only those that support his war? Think!

You agree that unification should wait until the people of Taiwan agrees to do so. But my point is that China is threatening and forcing Taiwan into submission much like how you all have been forced to accept the CCP. They use to UN to blackmail other countries who wish to recognise Taiwan risking the lives of thier people. You think China will agree even with International approval? Please... You may love your CCP. But my point is you don't have a choice! Lastly, I agree there are historic or even present connections between the countries of China and Taiwan, but to just point out connections without details is abit misleading don't you think? Taiwan is not part of China.

Before I touch on your point, I would like to reiterate that Taiwanese politics is NOT the topic of this thread. I touch on it only as a reply to astralis's.

Of course I know what I'm talking about. I a follow Taiwanese politics very closely. Do you know what the heck you're talking about? Yes, Taiwanese does want to keep the status quo. But the KMT are not trying to keep the status quo. They have reiterated that thier eventual goal is unification. Know what this means? KMT gets to be the puppet government should there be unification until the CCP takes over completely.

Your statement about the assasination attempt being fake is merely your opinion and assumption and not a fact. Others could assume that it was an attempt by the KMT not being able to lose another election or even the CCP which is not surprising given both parties record of violence.

You are also WRONG to say President Chen has corruption charges against him cos he doesn't. As president, he cannot be charged unless it's for crimes of sedition or treason. He may be charged when he steps down but we will only know later on so don't declare your assumptions as facts. This is not China and we are innocent until proven guilty.

Ma Ying Jeou (who just stepped down as KMT Chairman) on the other hand has already been indicted for corruption. And he still has the face to run for presidency!!! Unbelievable!!! It's one thing being accused of corruption when you are already president and it's a totally different thing when your are indicted and still want to run for president.

In addition, why is the KMT still asking Ma to represent them to run for president? If the KMT is for the people, why do they not return the illegally acquired assets that they STOLE during the martial law White Terror period??? Model of good governance? please.... stop... wakie wakie...

The recent spending increase is as expected??? For a country that is not under threat from any country that is NOT as expected. The raise in education spending, health spending.. blah blah blah, that is expected. However military spending should be much much less and the rest much more relative to CCP claims that China is on a peaceful rise.

Considering the amount of FDI pouring into the country of course more people are prospering. And it's just MORE, not alot relative to the population. This is as expected and not a particular achievement by the CCP. I have been to Shanghai and I know it's spectacular. But as I have already said, look inwards. China is not just Shanghai! And what's the point of having rural/municipal elections when ultimately, those offcials still have to bow to the CCP? The Chinese still haven't got a choice. Please... try to see underneath the stage shows.

nobody forced you to reply

KMT has to say certain things to appease chicom, but it has no intention to actually re-unify. In fact, Ma said in a recent interview that he if he is elected, he is seeking for 50 year agreement with chicom to maintain the current status quo. And the peace agreement would include provisions like PLA would have to take down the BMs that are aimed at Taiwan. Do you want to have a copy of it, since you are so unconvinced?

 
Your statement about the assasination attempt being fake is merely your opinion and assumption and not a fact. Others could assume that it was an attempt by the KMT not being able to lose another election or even the CCP which is not surprising given both parties record of violence.
 

are you actually hearing yourself? Lol, after the "assassination attempt", someone wanted to check if the President is okay, Chen actually flied to another hospital, because he didn't want the guy to see that it was fake. It's so sad. Why the heck would KMT/CCP attempt to assassinate him? Your point doesn't even make sense. Everyone knows that the sympathy factor would sway the election. If I'm the communists, I wouldn't even waste a bullet on him.

 
You are also WRONG to say President Chen has corruption charges against him cos he doesn't. As president, he cannot be charged unless it's for crimes of sedition or treason. He may be charged when he steps down but we will only know later on so don't declare your assumptions as facts. This is not China and we are innocent until proven guilty.
 

so your argument is that he can't be charged until later? lol, perfect. You would do wonders as the DPP publicist, you know that?

 
Ma Ying Jeou (who just stepped down as KMT Chairman) on the other hand has already been indicted for corruption. And he still has the face to run for presidency!!! Unbelievable!!!

Did I say anywhere that KMT was a model of good governance? Read what I wrote, I argued KMT is not selling out Taiwanese, because it's only favouring position adopted by the majority of Taiwanese. Btw, the more you talk about this, the more it just shows how ridiculous Taiwanese democracy really is.

 
The recent spending increase is as expected??? For a country that is not under threat from any country that is NOT as expected.
 

not under the threat? What do you call Cheney's effort to surround China with Japan, Australia and India? Maybe you should google up some of Cheney's recent statements. I would call having the most powerful nation in the world calling your their main opposition in the next 25 years quite a huge threat.

 
The raise in education spending, health spending.. blah blah blah, that is expected. However military spending should be much much less and the rest much more relative to CCP claims that China is on a peaceful rise.
 

It is much less, lol. I'd say 17.8% is much less than 42%, 80% or the 25% extra revenue. In fact, the amount of national budget spent on military has remained about the same in the recent years.

 
Considering the amount of FDI pouring into the country of course more people are prospering. And it's just MORE, not alot relative to the population. This is as expected and not a particular achievement by the CCP. I have been to Shanghai and I know it's spectacular. But as I have already said, look inwards. China is not just Shanghai! And what's the point of having rural/municipal elections when ultimately, those offcials still have to bow to the CCP? The Chinese still haven't got a choice. Please... try to see underneath the stage shows.
 

lol, the Chinese GDP growth is still not impressive enough for you? Why don't you name another nation that has achieved the same level of growth in a period of 25 years. As for the inside of China, I know what it's like, I've seen it grow by a lot. Btw, you know you have a lot of people on this forum who are trying to get you to know some real facts, you could do a lot of help for yourself by trying to read them.
 
 
 
Of course I know what I'm talking about. I a follow Taiwanese politics very closely. Do you know what the heck you're talking about? Yes, Taiwanese does want to keep the status quo. But the KMT are not trying to keep the status quo. They have reiterated that thier eventual goal is unification. Know what this means? KMT gets to be the puppet government should there be unification until the CCP takes over completely.

 

That proves you don't know what the hell you're talking about. KMT wants to control China as much as CCP wants to control Taiwan. Neither wants to be the puppet, hence the current standoff.
 
 
 
KMT has to say certain things to appease chicom, but it has no intention to actually re-unify. In fact, Ma said in a recent interview that he if he is elected, he is seeking for 50 year agreement with chicom to maintain the current status quo. And the peace agreement would include provisions like PLA would have to take down the BMs that are aimed at Taiwan. Do you want to have a copy of it, since you are so unconvinced?

are you actually hearing yourself? Lol, after the "assassination attempt", someone wanted to check if the President is okay, Chen actually flied to another hospital, because he didn't want the guy to see that it was fake. It's so sad. Why the heck would KMT/CCP attempt to assassinate him? Your point doesn't even make sense. Everyone knows that the sympathy factor would sway the election. If I'm the communists, I wouldn't even waste a bullet on him.

 

Yeah, I agree! KMT says all sorts of things to appease all sorts of people even though its contradictory. "50 year agreement to maintian status quo" which means unification after that. Of course PLA would have to remove the BMs cos it already means that Taiwan is just a Chinese province similar to that of HK. I don't need a copy, I'm aware of it. In fact if you want, I could send you the links to the different contradicting speeches that Ma makes. He's very much a tell-you-what-you-want-to-hear type of guy.

I didn't say that the KMT/CCP attempted to assassinate President Chen. I said that since your're making assumptions, it could go either way. If you're the communists? but you're not so no point arguing on that.

 
so your argument is that he can't be charged until later? lol, perfect. You would do wonders as the DPP publicist, you know that?

Did I say anywhere that KMT was a model of good governance? Read what I wrote, I argued KMT is not selling out Taiwanese, because it's only favouring position adopted by the majority of Taiwanese. Btw, the more you talk about this, the more it just shows how ridiculous Taiwanese democracy really is.

 

I'm not arguing that he can't be charged till later. I'm just pointing out your statement about Prsident Chen being charged is wrong because he can't. Please read carefully! And in any nation that respects human rights, you're innocent until proven guilty. And thank you for your compliment. Should I get a chance to be a DPP publicist one day, I would definately give my best!

I did read what you wrote, and yes you did argue that the KMT is trying to maintain the status quo. However, you immediately made a comparison and ended with the DPP not being a model of good governance. Hence I naturally assumed that you were stating that KMT was a model of good governance. I apologise for my mistaken assumption.

The ridiculous factor is definately not Taiwanese democracy. Taiwan has the most developed democratic system in Asia. However if what you intended to imply was that Taiwanese POLITICS is ridiculous I would definately agree. Eg, something as important to the country as a whole such as the govt budget could be held hostage just because a certain party wants to take control of the CEC.

 
not under the threat? What do you call Cheney's effort to surround China with Japan, Australia and India? Maybe you should google up some of Cheney's recent statements.

Btw, you know you have a lot of people on this forum who are trying to get you to know some real facts, you could do a lot of help for yourself by trying to read them.

 

Talking about getting to know facts, you should know that Cheney's statements came after a string of events such as China launching a missile into space, military build-up and 17.8% is the percentage increase. In fact it has increased by double digits every year recently which is nowhere near "remained about the same". Didn't President Bush call China a strtegic partner before all this?

Again, please read carefully, where did I indicate that Chinese GDP growth is not impressive? lol??? Jeez! I know China has the highest GDP growth in the world but what I'm asking is who and how many are prospering? Your answer - ooo I know what it's like, I've seen it grow by a lot. hookay then!

And what's the unreal facts that I have been saying? That China has one of the worst human rights record in the world? There no freedom-of-anything in China? That China is hostile despite its claims of peaceful-rise and defense only? You could do a lot of help for yourself by doing some thinking, and after that, please point out your real facts to me so I could correct my unreal facts. Thanks!
 
 
 
That proves you don't know what the hell you're talking about. KMT wants to control China as much as CCP wants to control Taiwan. Neither wants to be the puppet, hence the current standoff.

 

I'm speechless...... Since the late 1990's former KMT Chairman and Taiwan Preseident Lee Teng-hui has moved the KMT away fromt the one-China policy and towards Taiwan localisation. At present, the KMT wants to cooperate with the CCP and the current standoff is with the DDP not the KMT. Dude, where have you been?
 
 
 
Yeah, I agree! KMT says all sorts of things to appease all sorts of people even though its contradictory. "50 year agreement to maintian status quo" which means unification after that.

50 years from now, there is no telling what the Taiwanese political landscape would be. If there is a 50 year peace signed between ML and TW, that would reduce one area of instability for the world. That would be supported by every country in the world.

 
I didn't say that the KMT/CCP attempted to assassinate President Chen. I said that since your're making assumptions, it could go either way. If you're the communists? but you're not so no point arguing on that.
 

I'm saying it's clear that it was a fake assassination attempt. To say that it's not would be like believing in CCP's version of June 4th.

 
I'm not arguing that he can't be charged till later. I'm just pointing out your statement about Prsident Chen being charged is wrong because he can't. Please read carefully!

no problem, I see how it can be interpreted that way.

However if what you intended to imply was that Taiwanese POLITICS is ridiculous I would definately agree. Eg, something as important to the country as a whole such as the govt budget could be held hostage just because a certain party wants to take control of the CEC.
 

it's definitely not as developed as say South Korea or Japan.

the neocons, which Cheney is a huge supporter of, have regarded China as the great enemy all along. DoD's report last year called China the most likely country to threaten America in the next 25 years. So no, it's more than just Cheney.

a lot of minor reforms they've put in are very subtle and hard to see, but it's there. It's not noticeable unless you go to the country every couple of years and check how the society goes. But I guess some of the major implementations they've put in recent years include:
1. allowing freedom of press for foreign reporters until after beijing olympics. I think even after 2008, some of the changes giving press extra freedom will still be there. Notice the recent violence in Hunan, BBC was able to report there with no problem.
2. allowing rural election and municipal election. They still do weed out candidates they really don't like, but it is some grassroot democracy.
3. private property law - recently passed to give private property owners the same right as the land owned by the state.
 
 
 
it's definitely not as developed as say South Korea or Japan.

 

Please excuse me, I meant to exclude Japan when I stated Taiwan's democracy as being the most developed. As for South Korea, I would have thought that they would rank amongst the highest as they have always been at the forefront in championing for democracy. However, ARDA ranks it in the bottom half of the Asian countries. A read of their country report does shed some light.

 
the neocons, which Cheney is a huge supporter of, have regarded China as the great enemy all along. DoD's report last year called China the most likely country to threaten America in the next 25 years. So no, it's more than just Cheney.

On the topic of China, I have noticed for a while now that it is an emotionally charged topic that seems to be very much personal to many people in many countries. Maybe it's because that China's rapid rise affects many people whether in a positive or negative way. Would you agree that many facts pertaining to China can be related to the half full/empty glass theory? Debates seem to turn personal rather quickly of which I do not deny I may be one of the guilty ones. With this in mind, I do want to explain that although I aggressively criticise China, it is not directed to the Chinese people as a whole. Part of my roots come from China and I do feel pride to see the Chinese rise. Although many Chinese would post patriotic anecdotes on this and many other forums, I do sympathise with the many others that suffer because they want to voice out and because they fight for their rights. Among others I would like to invite people to read the case of Yang Zili and to lend support if you can.

On the issue of US - China security issues, I would like to say that although China announced that their military budget would rise to about US$45 billion, the majority of analyst outside China claims that actual spending is twice to three times more. It doesn't seem unreasonable to believe this as so much is hidden and kept secret in China. One might be able to reason this that China has been weak for so long and with the history of them being oppressed by the West and Japan that it is reasonable that they want to become a military power. However, that would be an outdated stance as today and in the foreseeable future, China does not have any natural threats. And it is also not-consistent with their claims of a peaceful rise. I feel that naturally, the US would definitely be concerned for the reasons I had just stated.

On what Cheney said, I would like to point out that he and President Bush are both idiots. Even then I believe that they too re not hostile towards China but more worried that China may become hostile once they have the military capabilities. Their economies are just too inter-dependant for them to go to war. Again, the main issue here would be Taiwan. My view is that if the US wants to destroy China, there is no better time than now. Just fully support Taiwan independence and when China attacks, the Taiwan Relations Act would be the perfect reason for them to attack China. The US will get international support as the world is against China's use of force against Taiwan. The war won't be fought on US soil thus minimizing US casualty and let's face it: no doubt China's military is on a rapid rise but they are still a long way from being on par with the US both conventionally and nuclear. I do believe that the US is trying to avoid confrontation with China.

Back to focus, the issue that will likely bring a US - China war would be Taiwan. Which I hope you could read the original posting and provide me your opinions. Thanks! On the topic of Taiwanese politics, I will create a thread on the topic with the host of events happening now as we near elections and would be very interested to hear your opinions.
 
 
 
I'm speechless...... Since the late 1990's former KMT Chairman and Taiwan Preseident Lee Teng-hui has moved the KMT away fromt the one-China policy and towards Taiwan localisation.

 

So he's more in line with the independence movement rather than the traditional Nationalist's stance of One-China.

I'm a registered democrat but you can never tell from what I say here and how I vote.

 
At present, the KMT wants to cooperate with the CCP and the current standoff is with the DDP not the KMT.

 

That's because both the CCP and the KMT agree there should be "One China." Not because either of them want to be a puppet government of the other.

 
Dude, where have you been?

We don't want to destroy China. We want to contain China. The old "containment" policy that worked against the Soviet Union will work against China also. We don't care about Taiwan's independence. Taiwan serves as a nice block against China in the east along with South Korea and Japan.

 
The US will get international support as the world is against China's use of force against Taiwan.

What makes you think the international community will be on our side? China invading Taiwan has nothing to do with us. We went into Iraq with more reason and look how the leftist press treats us. China, Cuba, and Venezuela are the darlings of the elite press. Guess which side they'll be on should a shooting war break out?

China won't invade Taiwan. They can't afford a loss of prestige should the invasion fail. Even if it's successful, they will lose good will with the Europeans and the Americans.

I can't deny that I am a little surprised (would like to get your opinion on up-coming US elections). Anyway, Lee's policies were not particularly in-line with the traditional KMT. But he did head the KMT then and was still KMT member after becoming President.

 
That's because both the CCP and the KMT agree there should be "One China." Not because either of them want to be a puppet government of the other.

 

I must agree that you made a point here. My opinion: KMT has always wanted to take control of the PRC. But that is more of a historical viewpoint. I am not saying they no longer harbour these intentions but that wouldn't really matter because it's just not possible (now and for the foreseeable future). So why is CCP still inviting the KMT to travel to China for negotiations even though they should be mortal enemies? And even though the KMT is not in power? I'm sure the discussion would not be about sharing control of China would it? It's more likely that the CCP will allow KMT to remain in control of Taiwan but under its rule. I'm not saying that the KMT wants to be CCP's puppet govt., just that it would rather be puppet than risk power falling back to the DPP since there is no possibility of them taking over the PRC.

NICE!!! The last time I was there, I was still a kid. Don't remember much of it beside what I see on TV and it looks good! I'm in investment banking and will be in NY in June, may want to take some time off to go around. Any place you'd recommend that I'd visit should I make a stop in CA?
 
 
 
We don't want to destroy China. We want to contain China. The old "containment" policy that worked against the Soviet Union will work against China also.

 

I agree that's why I said that if the US wanted to, they could already have used this reason too. But I do beg to differ on the old "containment" policy as claiming it will work is it bit underestimating China. Not that it won't work, but it needs much more than what was needed to contain Russia.

 
We don't care about Taiwan's independence. Taiwan serves as a nice block against China in the east along with South Korea and Japan.

 

Your usage of "we" gives the impression that your claims of "don't care" represent that of your country's. You might want to look into that. There are those that do care such as members of Congress that relentlessly push for policies in support of the Taiwanese cause. To these Democrats, Republicans and all others alike, my deepest respect and hats off! Also, if there is one person who could speak on behalf the entire country, it would be your President, not you. Here's some quote for you:

"From the day of our Founding, we have proclaimed that every man and woman on this earth has rights, and dignity, and matchless value, because they bear the image of the Maker of Heaven and earth. Across the generations we have proclaimed the imperative of self-government, because no one is fit to be a master, and no one deserves to be a slave. Advancing these ideals is the mission that created our Nation. It is the honorable achievement of our fathers."

"So it is the policy of the United States to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world."

"Freedom, by its nature, must be chosen, and defended by citizens, and sustained by the rule of law and the protection of minorities."

"The moral choice between oppression, which is always wrong, and freedom, which is eternally right. America will not pretend that jailed dissidents prefer their chains, or that women welcome humiliation and servitude, or that any human being aspires to live at the mercy of bullies."

"Some, I know, have questioned the global appeal of liberty - though this time in history, four decades defined by the swiftest advance of freedom ever seen, is an odd time for doubt. Americans, of all people, should never be surprised by the power of our ideals. Eventually, the call of freedom comes to every mind and every soul. We do not accept the existence of permanent tyranny because we do not accept the possibility of permanent slavery. Liberty will come to those who love it."

"Today, America speaks anew to the peoples of the world:

All who live in tyranny and hopelessness can know: the United States will not ignore your oppression, or excuse your oppressors. When you stand for your liberty, we will stand with you.

Democratic reformers facing repression, prison, or exile can know: America sees you for who you are: the future leaders of your free country."

Shame on You!!! For a registered Democrat, you're not so.....

But of course to believe every word of it would be being naive. You guys have a long history of "caring" only when it's beneficial or when it's a threat. And it's very clear the logistical advantage that Taiwan provides the US. Hence the two-face diplomacy employed with both Beijing and Taipei. It's not that Taiwan isn't aware of this, it's just that it's unfortunate that China has put them in a position that they don't have a choice but to embrace US's so called "care".

 
What makes you think the international community will be on our side? China invading Taiwan has nothing to do with us. We went into Iraq with more reason and look how the leftist press treats us. China, Cuba, and Venezuela are the darlings of the elite press. Guess which side they'll be on should a shooting war break out?

 

China invading Taiwan has everything to do with the US. You wanna know why? Because the Taiwan Relations Act that Congress passed in 1979 says so although it does not mandate compulsory action by the US should the PRC invade. An invasion by China and the occupation of Iraq are very different cases. The most obvious difference being that in the case of China, it would be coming to the defense of a democratic ally. Did the international community criticise Bush when he vowed to defend Taiwan at all cost? And weren't the reasons for invading Iraq, such as claims of WMD proven fake? Didn't oil have anything to do with it? Wouldn't the Cheney - Halliburton - Iraq link be a natural cause for suspicion? The press can say anything they want. I too do hate some things the press say, especially when they act irresponsibly. But any real democracy has it. You seem very afraid of the press. But any government who are afraid of taking action because their afraid of the press should step aside and let the press run the country. Let them set the policies.

 
China won't invade Taiwan. They can't afford a loss of prestige should the invasion fail. Even if it's successful, they will lose good will with the Europeans and the Americans.

 

They have declared to the world that they would invade if Taiwan declares formal independence. I think not invading would be a bigger loss of "face" than losing an invasion. And they never and still don't have good with the Americans and Europeans. I don't think they care what the rest of the world thinks. Just look at all the things they continue to do despite objections and criticism from the International community. But God I hope you're right!
 
 
gunnut, huaqiao,

to institute a containment policy on china would be orders of magnitude more difficult than the one against the USSR. one big difference is that, for one, china's neighbors aren't all that interested in doing so...

the US has recognized this and has chosen "containment-lite", otherwise known as "hedging".
 
 
Mianland and Taiwan are both belong to the China.
The condition of Mianland and Taiwan today is reason of the Civil War of China which has been 62 years from 1945.

Civil War was between CCP and KMT. KMT loss and ran to Taiwan. The KMT and CCP belong to China. Taiwan does not. During then, KMT illegally occupied Taiwan (UN Resolution No. 2758). China cannot claim Taiwan because they had some link with the KMT.
 
 
huaqiao,

that's sort of weak. japan surrendered taiwan, after all, to chiang kai-shek. and there hasn't been a "republic of taiwan" since 1895, when a qing official merely made it up as an excuse to continue fighting japan without involving the rest of (defeated) china.

Still doesn't change the fact that Taiwan isn't China. If a Dictator that once illegally ruled Taiwan makes a strong case for China to take over, then why not look at current realities: The DDP are in power (legally, democratically and popularly elected) and they say Taiwan is independent. In your context, this then should be the strongest case of all.

taiwan was part of china informally since the ming, and formally in the qing. so actually...taiwan was part of china, and the renouncing of the old 1895 shimonoseki treaty means that taiwan formally returns to its previous owners.

and regarding independence, no, even the DPP doesn't say that taiwan is LEGALLY independent. when have they changed the constitution, and when have they brought up taiwan's status for a vote?

if the pan-blues win the next election, does that mean taiwan just declared that it's part of china?

Hello huaqiao,

Could you then tell us please why Taiwan is called the Republic of China?

Or why there is a government for the whole of China sitting in Taipei?

(I may be a little behind the times here, and I am sure you can bring me up to date, but I believe that if this is not now the situation it was until recent times.)

astralis,

Before I forget I do want to make reference to your post on the "defence thread" and I agree that a post of mine had gotten a little personal. However you should know that Zheng did had a go at me even though I had not posted anything on that thread which prompted me to give him a piece of my mind. Even so, I do see your point and thank you for your reminder to refrain from personal attacks.

 
and regarding independence, no, even the DPP doesn't say that taiwan is LEGALLY independent. when have they changed the constitution, and when have they brought up taiwan's status for a vote?

if the pan-blues win the next election, does that mean taiwan just declared that it's part of china?  

 

You just emphasised my point as I was saying that just because Taiwan was ruled by a Chinese dictator in the past does not give legitimate claim to China to take over Taiwan. My reference to DPP was to show that if the former argument stands than the DPP should be able declare Taiwan's status anyway they like as they are the current ruling party. But of course this is not the case which also applies to the KMT if they win the next election, which goes back to the point that the CKS argument is not a valid one.

 
huaqiao,

This would provide a better argument than the CKS link for China to take over Taiwan. However, your above argument is incomplete. I have a article posted by Michael Le Houllier in another forum that is extremely relevant to your above comment and Taiwan's legal status. It is quite long so I will post it in a new thread under " Truth behind Taiwan's legal status ". It would definately shed some light and everyone can debate about it.

Hi xris,

Here's a great article by Wilson Chen in the Taipei Times that will answer your questions:

Since March 1, 1950, the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), separated by the Taiwan Strait, have been competing with each other to win the right to represent China in the international community. Both sides have regarded themselves as the only legitimate representative of China.

It was not until Oct. 25, 1971, when UN Resolution No. 2758 was passed, that the issue was resolved.

The resolution states that "[the UN decides] to expel forthwith the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek (蔣中正) from the place which they unlawfully occupy at the UN and in all the organizations related to it."

Today, the international community recognizes the government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) as the only legitimate government of China. As a result, the government of the Republic of China (ROC) has lost the legitimacy and legal right to act as the government of China.

This does not mean, however, that the PRC can can assert sovereignty over the ROC's territory. The reasons for this are two-fold.

First, the ROC refers to the Chiang regime, which had no legal claim to sovereignty over Taiwan's territory.

Second, after the signing of the San Francisco Peace Treaty on Sept. 8, 1951, Taiwan's sovereignty automatically passed to the Taiwanese people, but the Chiang regime deprived them of that right until the 10 Additional Articles of the Constitution were promulgated on May 1, 1991, during the administration of former president Lee Teng-hui (李登輝).

Through that amendment, the ROC government handed back sovereignty over Taiwan to the Taiwanese people and Taiwan legally speaking became a new state.

In other words, Taiwan is a de jure independent nation.

Article 1 of the Montevideo Convention on Rights and Duties of States, which was written in 1933, stipulates that a state as an international legal entity should possess the following qualifications: a permanent population, a defined territory, a government and the capacity to enter into relations with other states.

Taiwan obviously meets all four qualifications. Today, the nation's government is no longer a government-in-exile, but a legal government completely of and for this nation.

Furthermore, Article 3 of the Montevideo Convention also stipulates that "the political existence of the state is independent of recognition by the other states."

Therefore, even if Taiwan is not recognized by the international community, Taiwanese still have the right to safeguard the sovereignty of their nation and the integrity of their territory.

Those who do not identify with the nation of Taiwan should be allowed to leave for another country.

In short, the government of Taiwan is not the "Chinese government" that Chiang's regime falsely made itself out to be, but a political community with effective jurisdiction over Taiwan, the Pescadores, Kinmen and Matsu.

No other state has the right to claim sovereignty over the territory under the effective control of this political community.

According to British barrister Ian Brownlie, the PRC claims that "Taiwan is a part of China" and that "the `mainland' and Taiwan belong to the same China" do not deprive Taiwan of statehood.

The reason is that based on the Montevideo Convention, Taiwan is already a democratic nation with de jure independence.

(I hope this was helpful, but if you like to know more incl. Taiwan's history, I found this post on a another forum which I like to share and it's under the thread " Truth behind Taiwan's legal status ")
 
 
 
Whether it is re-unification or just plain forced take-over is still a subjective issue. But Through recent and not-so-recent historical facts, unification is just China unlawfully conquering Taiwan much like how Japan conquered parts of China, UNLESS unification is the choice of the people of Taiwan. And of course the decision not being under threat.

This of course being only on the surface. My Hong Kong friends tell me that the administration is actually a Beijing-installed puppet government. Though I'm not very familiar with this issue, I do remember it being aired on CNN. However, it is not beyond doubt that it will end if and once they are able to con the Taiwanese people into believing thier puppet show.

How do you believe a government that does not grant its people basic rights? That censors anything non-propagandist? That claims more than 80% of the world's execution rate and have the world's worst human rights record? Again, the list runs loooooooong.......

 

Without the "congratulations" from CCP Central Government, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government Chief Executive(CE, Mayor in Western term) could not survive, remember the big protest in Hong Kong on 1st July 2003 (七一大遊行), former CE Tung Chee Wa still dare not step down despite more than 500,000 Hong Kongers protest against him... (unlike Richard Nixon, he was simply a brave man in comparision!!!...)

 Hong Kong July 1 marches - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 

 Politics of Hong Kong - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 

Paraphrase...
"On March 12, 2005, the Chief Executive, Tung Chee-hwa, "resigned". Tung's position is now filled by Donald Tsang, formerly the Chief Secretary for Administration — a popular bow tie-wearing career civil servant who was educated at Harvard and received a knighthood for his service during British colonial rule. Immediately after Tung's resignation, Tsang assumed the role of acting Chief Executive, which he stepped down from prior to putting himself forward as a candidate for the post of Chief Executive. Tsang was subsequently chosen to be the next Chief Executive, and his term will expire in 2007."

When the Beijing master(remember NOT the residents live here!!!) decide his puppet "not good enough", he MUST stepped down.  

Hong Kong is realistic colony of Chinese Communist Party.
 
 
 
Yeah, I agree! KMT says all sorts of things to appease all sorts of people even though its contradictory. "50 year agreement to maintian status quo" which means unification after that. Of course PLA would have to remove the BMs cos it already means that Taiwan is just a Chinese province similar to that of HK. I don't need a copy, I'm aware of it. In fact if you want, I could send you the links to the different contradicting speeches that Ma makes. He's very much a tell-you-what-you-want-to-hear type of guy.

I didn't say that the KMT/CCP attempted to assassinate President Chen. I said that since your're making assumptions, it could go either way. If you're the communists? but you're not so no point arguing on that.

I'm not arguing that he can't be charged till later. I'm just pointing out your statement about Prsident Chen being charged is wrong because he can't. Please read carefully! And in any nation that respects human rights, you're innocent until proven guilty. And thank you for your compliment. Should I get a chance to be a DPP publicist one day, I would definately give my best!

I did read what you wrote, and yes you did argue that the KMT is trying to maintain the status quo. However, you immediately made a comparison and ended with the DPP not being a model of good governance. Hence I naturally assumed that you were stating that KMT was a model of good governance. I apologise for my mistaken assumption.

The ridiculous factor is definately not Taiwanese democracy. Taiwan has the most developed democratic system in Asia. However if what you intended to imply was that Taiwanese POLITICS is ridiculous I would definately agree. Eg, something as important to the country as a whole such as the govt budget could be held hostage just because a certain party wants to take control of the CEC.

Talking about getting to know facts, you should know that Cheney's statements came after a string of events such as China launching a missile into space, military build-up and 17.8% is the percentage increase. In fact it has increased by double digits every year recently which is nowhere near "remained about the same". Didn't President Bush call China a strtegic partner before all this?

Again, please read carefully, where did I indicate that Chinese GDP growth is not impressive? lol??? Jeez! I know China has the highest GDP growth in the world but what I'm asking is who and how many are prospering? Your answer - ooo I know what it's like, I've seen it grow by a lot. hookay then!

And what's the unreal facts that I have been saying? That China has one of the worst human rights record in the world? There no freedom-of-anything in China? That China is hostile despite its claims of peaceful-rise and defense only? You could do a lot of help for yourself by doing some thinking, and after that, please point out your real facts to me so I could correct my unreal facts. Thanks!

 

"There no freedom-of-anything in China?"

No at least Chinese have Freedom of Corruption(according to classical Communism idealogy) if you were CCP officials friends...
 
 
I wonder if some of the big time China critics, have ever actually been to China. I think it's ridiculous for people who have never been to China, to start telling people in China, that they are brainwashed and don't understand what is going on in their own country.

I don't like the Chinese government, and I'm not thrilled with all of it's policies. But, from the Chinese people I have talked too, things China have been getting rapidly better. The people have far more freedoms than they once did etc. And the Chinese plan for a gradual democracy, isn't so ridiculous I think. Democracy takes time.

Tell the Chinese Mining Industry workers, how much safety did they improve at all???

Whose Chinese plan for a gradual democracy? I'm sure not come from top Chinese leaders.

I'm come from Hong Kong(which is part of China right now!!!), witness the economic decline last 10 years (despite come back since RED HOT stock market...) and the incompetence of the so-called Hong Konger's government...

Of course Hong Konger's may feel things are worse, but you guys didn't experience what the rest of the Chinese experienced...So sorry, it's not the same thing, and besides are you living in China now?

I don't like the Chinese government. For example, I'm Catholic, and I don't like how the Chinese government treats the Church there, and how they try to control it etc.. I'm not a fan of that government, but even I know enough that things are improved it still needs improvment but things are better than they once were.

Although it is common for China defenders to question whether the critics have been to China, I can tell you that many have. Although China is incomparably more relaxed than it was a generation ago. People are still not free to bring about political change. It is still a one-party dictatorship where the one party has remained in power only because, in 1989, the army shot people to keep it there. Tens of thousands of people are locked up merely for exercising their rights to freedom of expression, association or belief. Torture and ill-treatment remain widespread. This is just the tip of the iceberg. Add to that: f.o.Movement, religious freedom, Falun Gong, ethnic minorities, organ harvesting, extrajudicial execution... the list of violations runs looooooooooooong.

Now I do not dare deny the CCP credit for it is guiding China towards great-power status. It has opted for growth over freedom, imposing stability by force. Some people accept this because the party has generated nationalist enthusiasm for regaining China's place in the world, overturning a century of humiliation at the hands of foreigners. But more realistically, the people just don't have a choice. In essence, China is still ruled by an evil regime where political reform is life-threatening.

Really? It seems that it is the CCP who are telling the world that people in China are "brainwashed and don't understand what is going on in their own country." What is the CCP trying to tell the world when they deny the people even the basic rights and freedoms? Why is there restriction and censorship of information? Why is the media controlled by the CCP? Why deny the people a voice? Why can't the poeple choose? Is the CCP trying to tell the world that the people of China are brainless? are incapable of making a choice (political, religous....) which they feel is right for them? does not have the ability to comprehend proper information and must be told what they can read, watch, or say?
 
 
 
II don't like the Chinese government, and I'm not thrilled with all of it's policies. But, from the Chinese people I have talked too, things China have been getting rapidly better.

 

I think no one will disagree that China is getting rapidly better in terms of thier wealth, economy, and infrasturcture. But there is a cost that infringes on the people's rights and well-being that most don't see because of the CCP. An example which you might want to find out more is the ten of thousands of illegal land transfer cases that happen every year. 90,000 in 2006 (if i'm not mistaken).

Yes, many China people does tell of how well and rosy China is, especially those online. But the economic success has really only benefit about 300 to 400 million people. what about the other 1 billion??? Those who cannot afford a computer and cannot afford to go overseas where they can access websites that are not blocked by the "Great Firewall of China" and tell the world of thier sufferings and injustices under the CCP?

Here's another example if you're interested, go to Youtube.com and search for the video:

"The Real China" or "Unseen China"

Here's another example:

Zhou Yongkang (minister of Public Security) admitted there were some 74,000protest in 2005. However, Sun Liping, a Chinese acdemic calculated that a more accurate figure (but still conservative) would be between 120 and 250 such protests daily in urban areas, and 90 to 160 in villages. These protest are more often violent clashes, riots. can you do the math?

 
And the Chinese plan for a gradual democracy, isn't so ridiculous I think. Democracy takes time.

 

isn't ridiculous? Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao has announced that there will not be any form of democracy in China for at least another 100 years. Maybe you should say democracy takes life times because it is likely that no living person today will live to see if that happens.
 
 
The truth about the CCP is that they are actually a Fascist regime hiding under a communist shell, enjoying the spoils of a Capitalist economy. They supress the rights and freedom of the people because they know they won't be able to hold on to power otherwise. How else does a party that have killed an estimated 80 million of thier own people stay in power?

Even if democracy is impossible, people do not deserve to be jailed and tortured for opinions that run counter to the government. People do not deserved to be forced out of thier homes with little or NO compensation for the government to build tall buildings or venues for the Beijing Olympics. Everyone can see that the economy is doing well under the CCP, but this those not prove that democracy cannot do just as well, if not better. The economy is not and should not be used as an excuse to accept and defend the atrocities of the CCP.

Hi, I see you're a fan of the Enzo model. At first, I didn't really like it when I saw the pictures in the magazine, but just the other day, there was one red Enzo parked outside the restaurant I was dining in and I think it changed my previous impression of the car. Truely magnificent! Can see why they say Ferraris are masterpieces of automotive artwork.

In a way, I do understand your emotions. I have many friends from HK and they too share your frutrations.

Although China has formally promised that it will respect Hong Kong's autonomy after the British territory reverts to Chinese sovereignty, there has been a growing unease over the extent to which Beijing is forcing its will on Hong Kong.

Anson Chan, chief secretary and the highest-ranking civil servant in Hong Kong, has accused the Beijing-appointed panel that will revoke or modify the civil-liberties laws of ignoring the apprehensions of Hong Kong citizens toward China. This is what she said: "the decision by the Beijing caucus to return to Draconian colonial laws governing the freedom of assembly and the right of association has created doubts abroad about China's commitment to Hong Kong's way of life." China's repealling key portions of Hong Kong's Bill of Rights and civil liberties laws.

By the way, how's the situation after that?
