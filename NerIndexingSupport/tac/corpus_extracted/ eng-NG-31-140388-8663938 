Hey All-

I'm doing the Ride for 65 Roses again this year (65 miles).  It's a
cycling event put on by CFF (cystic fibrosis foundation) and of course
the objective is to raise money to further research.  The minimum goal
is $165.00 and I'd like to at least get to this level. Any donation
that you can make would be much appreciated. I'm aware that some
others in AC-FC will also be doing this ride so your support will be
appreciated by all of us.

Here's a link to my fundraising homepage:
