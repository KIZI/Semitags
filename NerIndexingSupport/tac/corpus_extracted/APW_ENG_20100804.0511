Phoenix fire crews are at the scene of a plane crash near Deer Valley Airport in north Phoenix.

Crews sprayed water on the smoldering wreckage of what appears to be a small airplane.

A helicopter pilot for various Phoenix television stations says he saw the plane crash around 6 a.m. Wednesday. The plane burst into flames and produced a cloud of smoke that could be seen miles away.

The wreckage is smoking and is crumpled up against a building in an industrial area around the airport.

There's no confirmation yet whether anyone was injured or killed. Calls to the Federal Aviation Administration and the Phoenix Fire Department weren't immediately returned.
