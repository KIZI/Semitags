Officials with the Travis County medical
examiner's office said Monday that they have positively identified
Andrew Joseph Stack III as the pilot of a single-engine plane that
authorities said was intentionally flown into an office building
that houses IRS offices.

According to Sarah Scott, chief administrative officer for the
agency, Stack died of blunt force injuries and the manner is
suicide.

Vernon Hunter, who was in the building and was killed in
Thursday's crash, died of "conflagration injuries" and and manner
of death is homicide, Scott said.

Meanwhile, Erik Vasys, spokesman for the FBI, said agents have
finished gathering evidence from the building and have released it
to its owners.

"The investigation on our end is still active, and we aren't
able to provide any further details at this time," he said.
