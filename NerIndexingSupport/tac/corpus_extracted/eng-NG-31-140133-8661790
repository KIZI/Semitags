Michigan, ranked #3, loses to Appalachian State?? HAHAHA. Â In the Big House?
Henne and Hart, who could have entered the NFL draft decide to stay in
school to win a National Championship and beat The Ohio State Buckeyes,
lose to Appalachian State which should have been a one sided barn burner?
At home?

LOL!

Llyod Carr - Has to be his last season at Michigan, I'd think. He'd have
to go undefeated the rest of the season to save his job. I thought he
should have been axed at least a year or two ago.

I listened to the 2nd half on the radio. Sloppy as you could expect a
first game to be, but still. Their defensive backfield didn't seem to be
very good, but being radio I couldn't tell for sure.

After the game in the locker room Llyod said to the radio interviewer:
"We weren't prepared. That's my fault." Duh. The opposing QB: "They were
just another jersey with a name on it to us." Hah...and he said that to
a Michigan radio guy.

Maybe Michigan will extend his contract because he graduates a high
percentage of his players, and few of them get into off-the-field
complications??

If you're an Ohio State fan, you gotta hope they keep him for as long as
he wants to coach there. :-D

Worse opening game loss in Notre Dame football history:

Georgia Tech 33
Notre Dame 3

ND's final rushing stat was MINUS yardage?

Didn't Charlie Weis recruit anyone??

They were unhappy with Ty Cunningham, but at this rate, they'll have a
FIRE CHARLIE WEIS website before season's end.

Meanwhile, Ty's Washington Huskies walloped Syracuse yesterday.

Wow, those Syracuse Orangemen uniforms were ugly!
I hope the Brownies never go to an all orange uniform!

YICH!
