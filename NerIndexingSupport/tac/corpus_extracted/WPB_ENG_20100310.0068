The Pennsylvania woman who allegedly used the Internet alias JihadJane to
recruit people for violent jihad had dropped out before reaching high school and
was married at age 16, the start of a bumpy life that might have left her
vulnerable to radical beliefs, according to federal sources and public records.

While caring for an ailing man in a suburban community where she had few
friends, Colleen Renee LaRose, 46, turned to YouTube, MySpace and electronic
message boards, where she found like-minded individuals bent on supporting
international terrorism, according to an indictment unsealed this week. Her path
to radicalization took years and included a series of online contacts with men
who urged her to action, the sources said.

LaRose left her live-in boyfriend in Pennsburg, a quiet town outside
Philadelphia, and traveled to Western Europe in August as part of an alleged
plan to kill a Swedish artist. LaRose believed she could "blend in" with the
community because of her blond hair, blue eyes and small frame, she wrote in
e-mail messages to her alleged co-conspirators.

FBI analysts and national security experts have worried for years that
Westerners with easy access to passports could be recruited for terrorist aims.
Michael Levy, the U.S. attorney in Philadelphia, said the JihadJane case
"shatters any lingering thought that we can spot a terrorist based on
appearance."

Central to LaRose's case is the Internet, which is being used increasingly by
al-Qaida and other groups to penetrate U.S. borders with radical propaganda,
National Counterterrorism Center Director Michael Leiter said in a talk last
month to the Intelligence and National Security Alliance.

"LaRose's actions again reflect the fact that immersing oneself in the
propaganda and culture of jihadists through the Internet can lead to an
individual attempting to undertake a violent act, no matter that person's age,
gender, or background," according to an analysis by the SITE Intelligence Group,
a private firm that monitors jihadist Web sites.

LaRose is scheduled to appear in court March 18 for an arraignment on charges
that she conspired to support terrorists and kill a Swedish artist and that she
lied to FBI agents about her online activities and associations. Prosecutors say
she could face life in prison if convicted. Mark Wilson, a public defender
representing her, declined to comment.

LaRose was arrested in October in Pennsylvania, accused of attempting to
transfer a passport stolen from her boyfriend, Kurt Gorman. She was appointed an
attorney, appeared at a brief public court hearing, agreed to be detained and
waived her right to a speedy trial. The grand jury indictment accusing LaRose of
terrorist offenses did not emerge until last week and was unsealed by
authorities Tuesday.

The charges came as a surprise to neighbors on Main Street in Pennsburg, a
little less than 50 miles from Philadelphia, where LaRose had lived for years
while taking care of Gorman's elderly father.

In an interview with CNN, Gorman said LaRose had vanished _ with his stolen
passport _ in August, shortly after his father's death. Prosecutors say she
traveled to Europe to find artist Lars Vilks as part of an alleged plot to kill
him in revenge for his provocative drawing of the Prophet Muhammad on the body
of a dog.

"Sounds crazy," Gorman told CNN. "It is hard to believe. ... She wasn't no
rocket scientist. She was limited in her capacity, so I'm not sure how much she
thought she could do on her own."

Four men and three women were arrested in Ireland by local police this week in
connection with the case, according to European news accounts.

LaRose had brushes with the law in Pennsylvania, where in 2002 she faced charges
of public drunkenness and disorderly conduct, according to public records. She
also fought charges in South Texas, where she lived with Sheldon "Buddy" Barnum,
the man she married at 16.

In a telephone interview, Barnum, who was 32 at the time of the 1980 wedding,
said: "What do I remember about her? Nothing. Wasn't nothing to remember."
