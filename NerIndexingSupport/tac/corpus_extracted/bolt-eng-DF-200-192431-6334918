If you knew that for some reason you could not fail, what would you do?

I'll start: I would do what everyone dreams of doing if they ever cross a question like "What is courage?" on an exam. Write: This is courage and leave the rest of the exam blank.
 
 
Ask out Keira Knightley.
 
 
Cure Cancer.
 
 
Try to fail, life is boring without risk, so I would tell that paradox to shove it.

Though I might be tempted to grab a British team an FSAE championship for once!
 
 
Disprove god/god's/afterlife/spirituality/souls so we can all move on.
 
 
Set out to discover the lost island of the nymphomaniacs
 
 
Theres so much. Win the World Cup, cure cancer, become the first non-American American president, bang Emma Watson. So much.
 
 
 
Ask out Keira Knightley.

 

Kelly Brook.  
 
 
I'd tell him how I feel....wish I did when I had the chance  

Right I'll stop being lame now.
 
 
 
Ask out Keira Knightley.

 

Split up your relationship with Keira Knightley (considering the asking-out was a success on your part) and have her all to myself  
 
 
Play the Lottery.
Then end all animal cruelty as I define it.
 
 
The stock market.
 
 
Win every big lottery i play...simple

I will not fail in discovering it before you!

C'mon you can do better than that  

World peace, global economic equity, cure all life threatening diseases, ask out/sex up/marry unbelievable women, start my own hedge fund to finance my independent film company, achieve immortality and then keep shoveling out mediocre rom-coms starring Zach Braff for all eternity.  
 
 
I'm seeing some pretty funny and good posts! hahah keep it up  

Here's another one: Get granted the power to never fail

Sorry for the lame-ty   But it's true if you get granted a wish what do you wish for? 3 more wishes  
 
 
Become Reni.
Also, I would try to fail.
 
 
Apply for job as King of the Universe.

But what if i wanted to be the best ping-pong player in the world but so did someone else? No one can fail, so what would happen? O.o
 
 
 
 

 

I know I said I'd stop being lame, but that actually did make me feel a bit better. Thank you!  
 
 
Overthrow the government, and transform Britain into a single-party state ruled by me and a team of attractive women including the babes in my signature, who I retrieved from the US beforehand.
 
 
Fall in love  

No but really I'd come up with a solution to the most hardcore mathematical problem to which there is (as yet) no solution. Everybody shall consider me a genius, I shall receive global recognition, I will have a lot of money. I will hire people to bring me bowls of coco pops when I am hungry and I will have a line of sex servants outside my door at all times. Both male and female; male because I like that, female incase I ever change my mind.

Or.. Prove that we are all born bisexual.. Just a little.

Choices choices.

Cool story bro, what's that mathematical problem you're referring to? Riemann Hypothesis?

Just as long as you didn't imagine it was the guy in my sig giving you a hug  
 
 
At a selfish level, learn to play several musical instruments like a god and forever be in concert. For the rest of the world, have enough food and medical supplies that everyone can gain access to - and not ever run out.
 
 
The lottery

Why? Are you about to tell me you've figured it out and I should be your best friend or bribe you for the solution?
 
 
I'd go on Xfactor. That would be a fun thing, as I'm completely tone deaf. I wonder if the magic that be would make the rest of the contestants awful, me fantastic or the judges and audience really stupid.
 
 
Isn't the title of this thread completely wrong? Basically, isn't this just "What would you do if you had a magic lamp with a genie inside it that granted you wishes?"?
 
 
Put on the euromillions

Because I like mathematics  . And no, even some of the greatest minds in the past century or so couldn't crack the Riemann hypothesis, some going crazy in the process so I doubt I will ever solve it  . Is the Riemann Hypothesis what you were referring to? Or a different problem?
 
 
Edit wikipedia to say that I came up with all the stuff that actually Pythagoras came up with - instant fame forever.

Then jump off a bridge in the hope of surviving for the lulz.
 
 
Become the third Chuckle brother.

We can crack it together.
 
 
Move to my old Biology teacher. South African which means her voice is a bit out, but damn! And she once Sao to our class she's from a background that promotes polygamy. O_O

But seriously, I'd probably cure cancer. Not least of all because I've lost loved ones to cancer, but more because it's a terrible illness that continues to affect millions of people and their families all over the world.

Best answer on the thread, now stop this thread and everybody else on the thread bog off.

Yes it was indeed a metaphor.

I would try to asexually reproduce.
 
 
End all cruelty in the world. (humans, non-human animals, AI, aliens... everybody... I'm covering all my bases here!)

End all starvation in the world.

Go on a giant, Earth-wide adventure that at some point would involve me saving someone's life as I swing across a canyon on a vine and heroic music plays in the background.

Go through a blackhole and find out where it leads...

Take the first plane leaving out of the international airport in New York with only a small carry-on bag...

Run for President of my country

Give presents to everyone on my magical flying sleigh... But it will take more than one night...

Walk on water

Give my mother and brother whatever they most desire (as long as it does not hurt anybody else).

Borrow a rocket and a space pilot and visit the moon for a while... though I suppose I'll have to go to Russia now, even though I live only an hour from NASA *grumbles*... But I want to visit Russia anyway...

Ride a wild horse

Invent my own version of Hogwarts!

Aquire a British accent

Fly a broomstick
 
 
I'd do the queen, repeatedly.
 
 
 
But what if i wanted to be the best ping-pong player in the world but so did someone else? No one can fail, so what would happen? O.o

 

Play doubles and reign supreme.
 
 
Skydiving! (Because as we all know, if at first you don't succeed...skydiving is not for you!   )

Yes I know, lame, very lame  
 
 
feed everyone for life tbh. buy an island lol

Win the lottery and play the stock market.
Buy the rights from Warners Bros and make an epic Harry Potter TV series that left out nothing from the books and starred children who could act.
Other fun stuff.

I would of course do nice things like help starving and sick people in the third world, give and enforce equal rights for women everywhere, stop global warming and waste, prevent overpopulation, be a sort of Utopian/Socialist and sort out this ****ing ****ing up world.
 
 
be totally cool about it
 
 
 
wot wud walking on water achieve might i ask?  

 

You would look like a boss.
 
 
Jump up into space and find a time-travelling alien and have crazy adventures with them. Since I can not fail and that is what I am attempting to do, reality will have to rewrite itself around me.

fall asleeo. Or in maths, where it says find 'x' just circle it an say there it is :P
 
 
Start a band
 
 
Ride a cat.
 
 
 
You would look like a boss.

 

Also, possibly create an entire religion around you..  

nice posts everyone   !! wuhuuu
 
 
 
wot wud walking on water achieve might i ask?  

 

I just wonder what it would be like. Would it be a combination of swimming and ice skaitng? I'd like to experience that.

... Also the whole thing about defying physics and having an entire religion built upon my teachings would be pretty cool.
 
 
lol
as if  
 
 
Play for Manchester united!!
