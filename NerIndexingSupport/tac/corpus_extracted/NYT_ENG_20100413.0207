After an NHL season dominated by the Olympics and by a debate
over head injuries, the playoffs are here, as usual, to supersede
any off-ice issues. Except that this spring, one of the eight
opening-round matchups stands out for its behind-the-scenes
questions as well as for what it offers in the rink.

The Phoenix Coyotes' matchup against the Detroit Red Wings,
which starts Wednesday night, is a surprise on many levels. It is a
showdown between an unheralded team and the league's
longest-running power -- hockey in the desert versus Hockeytown.

But perhaps the most surprising fact is simply that the Coyotes
still exist.

After going into bankruptcy protection last spring, the Coyotes
needed an entire summer of court proceedings to determine that they
would stay in Arizona rather than relocate to Hamilton, Ontario.
The NHL took over the team's ownership, yet despite the turmoil,
the Coyotes surged into the topmost reaches of the Western
Conference after missing the playoffs for six straight seasons.

But even now there are questions about what will happen to the
Coyotes next season. The city of Glendale, which owns the Coyotes'
home rink, Jobing.com Arena, recently signed preliminary lease
agreements with two competing ownership candidates: Ice Edge
Holdings, a group of Canadian and American investors that includes
a former Arizona attorney general; and Glendale Hockey, a group
headed by Jerry Reinsdorf, the owner of the Chicago White Sox and
the Chicago Bulls.

The separate agreements, termed "memos of understanding," are
different; both, however, call for a name change to the Arizona
Coyotes. Should both purchase attempts founder, the team could wind
up moving -- perhaps to Winnipeg, Manitoba, its original home.

Meanwhile, the Coyotes' general manager, Don Maloney, is the top
candidate to be selected executive of the year for engineering a
series of smart in-season acquisitions on a tight budget. The
coach, Dave Tippett, took over at the start of the season for Wayne
Gretzky, who resignedamid criticism that he was drawing too big a
salary. Tippett is the leading candidate for the Jack Adams Award
as coach of the year.

The Coyotes drew a league-low average of 11,989 to their games
in Glendale, a hard-to-reach western suburb in the traffic-choked
Valley of the Sun, but attendance went up considerably after New
Year's, and the season ended with four straight sellouts.

For this series, the Coyotes are trying to revive an old
Winnipeg tradition: the playoff whiteout, in which the fans show up
wearing white. A potential problem: the large diaspora of
Detroiters who live in the Phoenix area and are liable to spoil the
whiteout with splotches of red.

The Red Wings, whose late-season surge put them in the playoffs
for a 19th straight season -- the longest current streak in North
American major team sports -- are healthy after losing more than 300
man-games to injury. Along with Nicklas Lidstrom and Henrik
Zetterberg, their best player may by the rookie goalie Jimmy
Howard, who finished the season with a 13

2 run.

The Coyotes are led by Shane Doan, their 33-year-old captain and
No. 2 scorer, who has been with the club since 1995-96, its last
season in Winnipeg.

"Things were a little bit of a mess," Doan said of the mood in
the dressing room at the start of the season, "but we thought we
had a chance to make the playoffs."

Elsewhere in the West, the San Jose Sharks face the Colorado
Avalanche after winning the conference title for a third straight
season, but they are perennial playoff disappointments.

Vancouver Canucks goalie Roberto Luongo is hoping to follow his
Olympic gold medal with Canada with a Stanley Cup ring, a pursuit
that will begin against the Los Angeles Kings. Henrik Sedin is the
first Canuck to win the NHL scoring title in the club's 40-season
history.

The young Chicago Blackhawks are one of the league's glamour
teams, but their playoff run, which starts against the Nashville
Predators, could founder on the shaky goalkeeping of Antti Niemi
and Cristobal Huet.

In the East, the Philadelphia Flyers qualified for a first-round
matchup versus the Devils only because they won a season-ending
shootout against the Rangers.

Two other Eastern teams were every bit as mediocre this season
as the Flyers: the Montreal Canadiens, who are given little chance
against Alex Ovechkin and the Washington Capitals, the league's No.
1 finishers; and the Boston Bruins, who face the Buffalo Sabres and
their Olympic MVP goalie, Ryan Miller.

The defending Cup champions, the Pittsburgh Penguins, play the
Ottawa Senators. The Penguins have Sidney Crosby, scorer of the
Olympic gold-medal-winning goal, and Evgeni Malkin, last year's
playoff MVP, but are coming off a disappointing regular season.

Who will win the Stanley Cup this time around? Do not rule out
the Coyotes. The Devils won the Stanley Cup in 1995 despite the
real possibility that they were about to relocate to Nashville.
