In the brief about this thread or watever its called it says
"Do you like kiwis, kangaroos, Tasmanian devils and koalas?"
KIWIS are from New Zealand, not bloody australia,
I posted this just to rave because I had being mistaken for being australia or something from New Zealand being mistaken as australian.
Ur thoughts?
 
 
Geography is a very imprecise science, at least in some people's mind...

Do you know where to find Nukunonu?
 
 
Dartboy, welcome to A2K. I had no idea about the kiwi, so I searched out the image.

 

Kiwi chicks hatch fully feathered with their eyes open and begin foraging for small worms and berries after their first week of life, since they receive no help from their parents.
The kiwi hatched on Monday, February 13, weighing in at 9.7 ounces (275 grams) after 64 days of incubation. Zoo staff monitored the egg each day, by weighing it and using a bright light to illuminate the egg's interior.
The National Zoo is one of just four zoos in the world to breed kiwis outside of New Zealand. In 1975 the National Zoo was the first institution outside of New Zealand to hatch a kiwi. That 30-year-old bird is still on exhibit at the zoo's Bird House.
The five recognized species of kiwis are all flightless, nocturnal, burrowing birds that are unique to New Zealand. North Island brown kiwis are listed as endangered by the International Union of Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources.

I complained similarly at the site's inception.

Our creator said that we are considered to be all part of some entity called Oceania, or somesuch.

But..I feel your pain.

Australia is NOT the name of any of the the countries......except...er...Australia.

Kiwis do not live in Australai, but they DO live in New Zealand.
 
 
You people just resent the Inaccurate Western view of World Geography.
 
 
I think, possibly, the geography is correct......but the effect sucketh mightily.

It's like, say, calling South America Brazil, and then referring to things that occur only in Tierra del Fuego.

Why not just call it Oceania?

It'snot like it's a big thing, but it's like a pea under all the mattresses, I suppose, for New Zilluners.

OMG I HEAR THAT SO MUCH, if I knew where you lived id kill you, damn New Zealand isnt part of aussie, we are two different countries, its like saying japan is part of china, get it?

But even if New Zealand isn't part of Australia (the country) or Australia (the continent), Australia is still the name of both the country and of the continent. Right?
 
 
 
Australasia is a term variably used to describe a region of Oceania: Australia, New Zealand, and neighbouring islands in the Pacific Ocean. The term was coined by Charles de Brosses in Histoire des navigations aux terres australes (1756). He derived it from the Latin for "south of Asia" and differentiated the area from Polynesia (to the east) and the southeast Pacific (Magellanica). It is also distinct from Micronesia (to the northeast).

Physiographically, Australasia includes the Australian continent (along with the Australian island-state of Tasmania), New Zealand, and Melanesia: New Guinea and neighbouring islands north and east of Australia in the Pacific Ocean. The designation is sometimes applied to all the lands and islands of the Pacific Ocean lying between the equator and latitude 47Â° south.

Most of Australia lies on the southern portion of the Indo-Australian Plate, flanked by the Indian Ocean to the west and the Southern Ocean to the south. Peripheral territories lie on the Eurasian Plate to the northwest, the Philippine Plate to the north, and in the Pacific Ocean - including numerous marginal seas - atop the Pacific Plate to the north and east.

Geopolitically, Australasia is sometimes used as a term for Australia and New Zealand together, in the absence of another word limited to those two countries. There are many organizations whose names are prefixed with "(Royal) Australasian Society" that are limited to just Australia and New Zealand.

Australasian Olympic FlagIn the past, Australasia has been used as a name for combined Australia/New Zealand sporting teams. Examples include tennis between 1905 and 1913, when Australia and New Zealand combined its best players to compete in the Davis Cup international tournament (and won it in 1907, 1908, 1909 and 1911), and at the Olympic Games of 1908 and 1912. Australasia also competed in the 1911 Festival of Light in London, the precursor of the Commonwealth Games.

In speculative fiction or counterfactual historical analysis, it is used to describe an alternate history Australia and New Zealand which agreed to political union at Australian federation in 1901, rather than seeking divergent British Empire Dominion status in 1901 and 1907 respectively.

Anthropologists, although disagreeing on details, generally support theories that call for a Southeastern Asian origin of indigenous island peoples in Australasia and neighboring subregions.

From an ecological perspective the Australasia ecozone is a distinct region with a common evolutionary history and a great many unique flora and fauna. In this context, Australasia is limited to Australia, New Guinea, and neighbouring islands, including the Indonesian islands from Lombok and Sulawesi eastward. The biological dividing line from Asia is the Wallace line - Borneo and Bali lie on the western, Asian side. New Zealand comprises another ecological zone altogether, as it had been isolated from the rest of the world, including the rest of Australasia, for even longer.

Yes.

But the country of Australia does NOT include the country, New Zealand.

This Forum, which is called Australia has names the kiwi, which is NOT an Australian bird...thus denoting that New Zealand is to be discussed under Australia.

That's like including discussions of Canada under the USA, rather than under North America.
 
 
I was taught, in school, about Australasia and Oceania, but I'm not at all surprised at people's limited knowledge of geography...

Even from those who are so adamant about local stuff...

People from Ingushi will be very upset if you don't know their capital...

I don't think that equating New Zealand with Australia is so very local! It's a different COUNTRY! You have to FLY to it! There'd be five different countries beneath your wings before you got there, if it were the same distance travelled in Europe!

Call it Australasis, or Oceania...no beef. But calling it Australia is gonna piss off all the New Zealanders no end.

Threatening people over it is ridiculous, of course.....but it is a recipe for fireworks from time to time.

And apparently, neither does the continent. In fact, there seems to be a whole continent called Zealandia. Who'd've known?

Now that's just rude.

Or discussions about Austria under Germany, I suppose.

I'd be offended.
 
 
Bunny, I'm able to know the differents countries of the world.

What I mean is that to the average people from Minnesota or Puglia such distinction is beyond their immediate concern..

Now, I would like Dartboy answer my initial question without further research...

Well, one is not supposed to know an island of a New Zealand administered territory...

Just like people in other parts of the world don't know what Kiwis are...
 
 
Why the devil would anyone want to kill me over the name of the continent? As it seems to have slipped some folks' notice, I will explain.

The geographic forums are all named after continents. None of them are named after countries. Hence Australia is the continent. Don't like that? Take it up with Funk & Wagnalls or the Atlas people or God or whoever goes around naming continents.

As for the reference to kiwis, yes, it's a reference to the bird. Which is a native of NZ. You may have noticed (or not) that some of the other continent forums are described with things that aren't -- how exciting! -- countries or people.

Now, stop trying to kill me and go after Funk & Wagnalls. Thanks.

Wanting to kill you is silly, but your response is sort of silly too.

While I have very little investment in the grievance, it is pretty easy to see that "North America" and "Asia" are very different descriptions from "Australia".

This is because Australia is the name of a country.

Citizens of any other country lumped under "Australia" are going to have the same reaction as you might if you came across a website where North America was not called that, but Canada.

Likewise, people fropm Asian countries other than China might object if their region was lumped under "China".

I really don't think Funk and Wagnalls is a discussion closer, and this concern will be raised from time to time because, to non geographer's eyes who care abut such things, (and New Zealanders do...as would the people of the many other islands, if they visited, no doubt) the name of the "Australia" forum is insulting.

While I agree that becoming as foolishly aggressive as what's his name did is ridiculous, dismissing objections as you did is needlessly, well, at the least, dismissive, in my view. Perfectly reasonable New Zealanders have objected in the past.

Thank you.

As for what I call you guys? Down Under.

The planet has no "up" except away from the centre of gravity, and no "down" except towards it....the rest is northern exceptionalism.

 
 
 
There remains provision within the Australian Constitution for New Zealand to become another State of Australia.

I didnt mean anything when I said I'd kill you, it was a joke take it easy and New Zealand will never become a state of aussie, thats plain dumb, the closest that that has ever happened was when we nearly joined our dollar to make one currency

P.s Francis, your a dork

Dude...

The point of this post was pointing out that Kiwis are not australian which dlowan agrees with too, thats all

NOOOOOO! Don't start the continents debate again. Europe is not a continent. Antartica is....

Which continent is Tahiti a part of?

isnt tahiti just an island like New Zealand and not part of one?
 

 
Zealandia, also known as the New Zealand continent, is a nearly submerged continent that sank after breaking away from Australia 60-85 million years ago and from Antarctica between 130 and 85 million years ago. It may have been completely submerged about 23 million years ago, and most of it (93%) remains submerged under the Pacific Ocean.

Zealandia is 3,500,000 kmÂ² in area; this is larger than Greenland or India, and almost half the size of Australia. It is unusually long and narrow, stretching from New Caledonia in the north to beyond New Zealand's sub-antarctic islands in the south (from latitude 19Â° south to 56Â° south, analogous to ranging from Haiti to Hudson Bay or from Sudan to Sweden in the northern hemisphere). New Zealand is the largest part of Zealandia that is above sea level, followed by New Caledonia.

Oh goddess no...here we go again.

It's a KIWI FRUIT, not a kiwi, got it?

The kiwi means a cute flightless bird that lives in a New Zealand, or a not necessarily cute human who does the same.
 
 
What would happen if it remerged? would it be New Zealand or be part of france? or would aussie even pop in and try and claim it?
 
 
And besides, Kiwi fruit is a marketing term for an imported cultivar

Names

This fruit had a long history before it was commercialised as kiwifruit and therefore had many other older names.

In Chinese[1]:

* Macaque peach (ç¼ç´æ¡ mÃ­hÃ³u tÃ¡o): the most common name
* Macaque pear (çç´æ¢¨ mÃ­hÃ³u lÃ­)
* Vine pear (è¤æ¢¨ tÃ©ng lÃ­)
* Sunny peach (é³æ¡ yÃ¡ng tÃ¡o)
* Wood berry (æ¨å­ mÃ¹ zi)
* Unusual fruit or wonder fruit (å¥ç°æ qÃ­yÃ¬ guÇ): the most common name in Taiwan and Hong Kong (å¥ç°æ kay yee goh). A quasi-transliteration of "kiwifruit", literally "strange fruit".

When introduced to New Zealand by Isabel Fraser it was called yÃ¡ng tÃ¡o. People thought it had a gooseberry flavour and began to call it the Chinese gooseberry, but it is not related to the Grossulariaceae (gooseberry) family.

The fruit was exported to the US in the 1950s. Among the exporters was the prominent produce company Turners and Growers, who were calling the berries melonettes, because the name Chinese gooseberry had political connotations due to the cold war. An American importer, Norman Sondag of San Francisco, complained that melonettes was as bad as Chinese gooseberry because melons and berries were both subject to high import tariffs. In June 1959, during a meeting of Turners and Growers management in Auckland, Jack Turner suggested the name kiwifruit which was adopted and later became the industry wide name.[2]

Most New Zealand kiwifruit is now marketed under the brand-name label Zespri which is trademarked by a marketing company domiciled in New Zealand, ZESPRI International. The branding move also served to distinguish New Zealand kiwifruit from fruit produced by other countries who could cash in on the "Kiwi" name, as it was not trademarked. From 2005, Zespri launched a new promotional campaign worldwide featuring Japanese superstar Ayumi Hamasaki as their spokeswoman.
 
 
in official geography, whatever that is, what CONTINENT does Australia the country belong to?

what CONTINENT does New Zealand belong to? I get that when they are called the same, that might rub some people the wrong way, but that don't make it officially wrong (emotionally maybe, but that's a separate subject).

Kinda like 'America' - that's the other way around. America is the whole continent but it's also how most of the world refers to USA colloquially.
I'm sure plenty of people hate that,too, but oh well. It's not going anywhere it seems.

So, I'm wondering...
If there was a rare bird that only lived in Slovakia, it would be correct to also call it a European bird, right? Since it's on the continent of Europe as well.

But if a Kiwi lives in New Zealand, it is also... what... Oceanian? Or Australian (the continent)? Is there any consensus on the official name of the continent? I remember being always taught it's Australia. Doing quick search now that's what I see most often, followed by Australia and New Zealand sort of slapped onto the side on some maps of continents, even though it's not listed among 7 continents when they are written out. Oceania does appear on maps, but not among the names of continents. I'm confused.
 
 
OK. So more detailed search revealed that:

"New Zealand is not on the same continental shelf and so is not part of the continent of Australia but is part of the submerged continent Zealandia and the wider region known as Oceania."

So if I was a poor fifth grader, or whenever the kids are learning continents and was told to put New Zealand into one of the seven continents of the world, what should I do? I have honestly not heard of the continent called Zealandia to this day and I don't think it's taught that way anywhere.
How is this geographical confusion (to me anyway) treated in Australia and New Zealand (the countries...)?
 
 
Thank you, hingehead. That's everything I wanted to know about them. Possibly more.

The thing with the Kiwi bird is that it is flightless and since austrilia is roughly 2500km(im not sure on that but its close) I dont think its the same as "If there was a rare bird that only lived in Slovakia, it would be correct to also call it a European bird, right? Since it's on the continent of Europe as well." Do you see what I mean
 
 
 
since austrilia is roughly 2500km..
 

Now some austrilians will want to kill you..  
 
 
About a year ago, I was holidaying in the South Island of NZ. I visited a few cities/towns and read a newspaper in each of them. What amazed me was that in each of the newspapers I read, there was a constant and large dose of bagging Australia....now some of it was good natured, and some of it was...well, I'm sure kiwis would say 'telling it like it is', which I couldn't debate...the bemusing thing as I said, was the sheer amount of it.

  I can only put it down to little neighbour syndrome, as well as some deserved criticism...which must be why they all come to live over here :wink:

Yes I do, but I believe you're wrong here. Let's say our Slovak bird is genetically mutated. Has no wings, no legs even. Cannot move anywhere, lives only in an area of 5 square km. It would STILL be a European bird, because Slovakia is on European soil.

Thusly, a Kiwi would STILL be.........-ian (insert the name of the continent on the dotted line).

Unless you are advocating some exceptionalism for New Zealand (why not, don't we all think our homelands are exceptional? Well, I don't, but I don't count- I'm a lousy patriot).

I think Australia the continent belongs to Oceania or Australasia.....though I think Craven convinced me that some people use Australia to cover the entire entity. I honestly do not know how commonly they do so...but Funk and Wagnalls sure doesn't cut it for me! It would be interesting if some geography types came and talked about it. I truly claim no real knowledge.

I had honestly never heard of such a useage, but Craven's research is usually good, so that is likely my lack of current geographical terminology. The thing is, that useage is obviously little known in the area concerned, and causes some people offence.

I was largely amused when I first saw it, and commented on Craven's ignorance, and was then interested by the explanation, which was new information.

I hardly see it as a big deal, but I think it unreasonable to be so dismissive to people about their reactions to what is seen to be ignorance, and patronising nomenclature, just as non USA people sometimes react to meaning only the USA when you say America.

I think that, given there is a perfectly good alternative name (two, in fact) that it was somewhat ignorant to use Australia, but certainly not something worth being as rude as Dartboy was about!!!

The kiwis (birds) being put under Australia as a general heading is utterly hilarious to we natives, and clearly a cause for concern for a number of kiwis (the people).

So....I hear that Australia is an accurate general heading, but I think one of the others would be a lot clearer, and cause less consternation. Given my dismissal of nationalism and patriotism, I have no leg to stand on re being personally irked, but I confess to a wee twinge of irkedness about it early on.

However, since we have Australia, and are likely stuck with it, the odd denizen of the south will be annoyed/amused/scornful from time to time.

My only reason for coming back to this discussion is that I think this irkedness is not all that unreasonable, and I think it unreasonable to be completely dismissive of it. The manner of expressing it on this occasion did, however, leabe a lot to be desired.
 
 
Hello, Dartboy, very nice to meet you!  

Can you elighten me? Something I've been curious about for some time now.... why do so many New Zealanders want to become Australians? Honestly, you can't walk down the street here without falling over a New Zealander (or 4) these days! Why, why, why are the Kiwis doing this migration in such droves? New Zealand seems such a good place to live to me.... I'm perplexed. Especially given the raw deal many workers receive these days in the land of Oz. What's it all about, then?
 
 
More for Daggles:

OE is citing sources suggesting New Zealand IS part of a different continent, BTW...Zealandia.

To contradict myself, I can see that calling the "Australia" Forum Australia kind of makes sense, because how many people are gonna know what Oceania is?

But Australasia is pretty comprehensible.

Seems like we don't know what to call ourselves!

:wink:
 
 
that's rather odd to me, dlowan. I'm not advocating that New Zealand must belong to Australian continent... but it's such a tiny country that it is somewhat ridiculous (to me) to claim a separate continent. Think how huge is Asia or the Americas.... I know I know, continental plates and whatnot, still it strikes me (from here) a silly dispute.

I get that these are sensitive issues for some. I don't care either way, but it's fascinating to watch.

Yeah, Oz kind of fills in our region a role similar to the USA in the world.

You know...the powerhouse economy, the big place, the military power...lots of folk in the region move here.

However, same complaints as re the US: arrogant, ignorant, tries to push people around, crass culture that tries to dominate, threatening when it doesn't get what it wants...opportunistic and immoral (see the Australian role re East Timor, before the UN action which we provided the military for...we are now busy exploiting their oil for insufficient recompense...sigh)

There's the same thing re military "might" (a VERY relative term here...!!!!!) too.....they want our help, but resent it when it comes.

Thus, the region is very critical of us, and very resentful.

So it goes.

arsholes usually suffices.

Interestingly enough, my daughter says many of her international friends cannot distinguish between a NZ accent and an Australian accent.

I think changing the preamble of this forum to remove the word Kiwi from its current position would go some way to soothing the debate.
I can imagine Tasweigans being a little put out by being listed as a separate interest to the rest of Aussie as well. Us Victorians are pissed that there is no mention of Melbourne which is an altogether much nicer city than any of the other places mentioned.

Do you like kangaroos, Tasmanian devils and koalas? Interested in kiwis or sheep rooting? Want to learn about Perth, The Alice, Hobart, Canberra or Sydney? Here's the place to discuss all things Aussie or Kiwi or any of the other countries usually associated with these great and outstanding nations.

Vikorr: Yes our newspapers and newstations often bag Australia, we view it more as friendly abuse more than GRRR abuse, bit wierd I know but when it comes down to it, we would always back Australia in a fight

Dagmaraka: I still think its more a New Zealand bird than a "continent" bird as we are so far away and it is really a NZ bird but I totally see what you mean and understand where you are coming from.

Dlowan: Australasia I see as both NZ and Aussie but I never really meant the continent part of this post, I was meaning the countries, that its our bird not yours. I would probably preferr Australasia as a general heading and imply that its both about Aussie and NZ but hey, I cant always have what I want. Also How am I being rude? Just out of interest, I mean this post as a bit of a joke but I was totally surprised when I saw the replies and the pages.

Msolga:Sure, New Zealanders want to become Aussies, you are a huge country with 5 times our amount in POP and offer alot more than we do, New Zealander often move to Aussie to avoid paying their student load and also your workforce it loads better, its often on our News and I totally agree with it, I will probably move to Aussie or England once I finish school because we have appauling standards in NZ

Dadpad: Nice point, I love it

Yes, you're doing OK. You're not making a fool of yourself.

If you don't know the answer to anything, or feel you're being asked an unfair question, just feel free to say you don't know the answer or the question is unanswerable, or whatever applies.... No one knows everything, you know!

What do you think would happen if the continent,Zealandia, remerged? would it be New Zealand or be part of france? or would aussie even pop in and try and claim it?

Seriously? It would be probably be divided up like the Antarctic based the existing EEZs (  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EEZ  ).

But for it to happen the sealevel would have to drop so much that Zealandia would be the least of Australia's problems - the land bridge to Asia would be traversible again and John Howard would be reelected after a scandal involving refugees 'allegedly' throwing their children out of a bus, or leaving them in a hot car.

Nobody.

We'd be lucky if we managed to make the new border half way.....you buggers would be likely to make a claim for the whole of the new Western land, and, between the bloody noisy hakas, Helen Clark's whining, and the fact that most of you are here already, we'd probably give in.

Thats a huge steriotype, Yes I do the haka before I play rugby every saturday, I did it when a teacher died at school but the way you guys are going on about it its like whenever you walk down the street you see about 20 people doing a haka, which isnt the case. I doubt that even half of kiwis would know how to do the haka anyway

The team that beat us was the team that currently holds the world cup, who managed to scrape to a victory against us in the last world cup final, in which there were no teams wearing black..

Actually, young fella, the Bledisloe cup runs at 38 for NZ to 12 for Australia

So closer to 3-1

And if we just take the the Bledisloe's since you were born it's 9 NZ, 8 Oz so more like evens in your memory.

World Cups run 2 to Australia 1 to NZ

Of course we might be better at Rugby if we weren't spending so much time being world champions in so many other team and individual sports.

Now look what you've done, you show a bit of nationalism and now I'm showing mine. It's like you just yawned and now everyone else in the room has to.

A word of advice: as you progress through your law degree you might want to do some research to back up your assertions before you make them - or you could hire a brilliant librarian, like myself.

One positive thing that I would like to mention about Kiwis, is that they seem to be very eco-friendly.
Why, only last week they offered, in an attempt to cut down on aviation fuel, to drop off the Aussies on their way home after their early exits from the Rugby World Cup.

Hi DB

Clearly you are in the majority - union is much more widely played around the world, but I would have thought league would be more of a challenge. Two less players and a lot less stoppages.

What would you say makes union more challenging than league? I'm not taking the piss, I really want to know and because you've played both I respect your opinion.

I was too much of girl for those games. Played hockey and soccer and then one season of AFL - now that was a challenge....
 
 
Builders back. I like the builder bloke.

I was pruning once with a kiwi bloke when it started to rain. we very quickly got quite damp.

He said "jeez your rain over here is wet!"

I just rolled my eyes and said "sweet as cuz"

The party was at Pinkenba, and the place is loaded with Kiwis.  

It's part of a take-over bid for sure.

Well for starters, the 2 extra mean its harder to score and break the line, there are more set plays, we have rucks/breakdowns meaning forwards have to comit to protect/steal ball, we have placement kicks to get a lineout which has setplays of it, in our scrums we push and move meaning we can score by pushing the scrum over the line, in league they have a defence line, anyone tackles really, in union we have jobs for our position, Im a flanker meaning when they have the ball I follow it and tackle and try to steal it while the backs wait for me to get the ball to give to them. If ive forgotten any add them in guys but I think thats the basics
 
 
Thanks for the expo DB. I'd always seen men in their mid 40s playing 5th grade union (usually in the forwards), never seen that in league, so I assumed it was much tougher on the body - not that that necessarily makes in a more challenging sport.

I think Australia the continent belongs to Oceania or Australasia.....though I think Craven convinced me that some people use Australia to cover the entire entity. I honestly do not know how commonly they do so...but Funk and Wagnalls sure doesn't cut it for me! It would be interesting if some geography types came and talked about it. I truly claim no real knowledge.

I had honestly never heard of such a useage, but Craven's research is usually good, so that is likely my lack of current geographical terminology. The thing is, that useage is obviously little known in the area concerned, and causes some people offence.

I was largely amused when I first saw it, and commented on Craven's ignorance, and was then interested by the explanation, which was new information.

I hardly see it as a big deal, but I think it unreasonable to be so dismissive to people about their reactions to what is seen to be ignorance, and patronising nomenclature, just as non USA people sometimes react to meaning only the USA when you say America.

I think that, given there is a perfectly good alternative name (two, in fact) that it was somewhat ignorant to use Australia, but certainly not something worth being as rude as Dartboy was about!!!

 

There's no real authority on any of this, hell you can't even get everyone to agree on how many continents there are, much less what the best name would be.

The 7-continent model favored by Western cultures is only one of several continent models, Japan and many other countries prefer the 6-continent model for example and there are other 5-continent and 4-continent models.

New Zealand
New Zealand is an individual country, has no links as far a government with Australia.

Sports-wise the Ozzies are our greatest rivals.

We do allow them to come and live here freely just as we can go and live there.

We have our own prime-minister, our own governor general ( yes we both acknowledge the Queen as our sovereign).

We have different laws, different taxes, in other words, New Zealanders are just that, or Kiwis if you want a local name for us.

Australian, or Ozzies, are a different breed entirely, the British part of them was shipped there in convict ships long ago. (that is a Kiwi joke)
 
 
Kiwi joke? Sorry - that does not compute  
 
 
Re: New Zealand

 
Australian, or Ozzies, are a different breed entirely, the British part of them was shipped there in convict ships long ago.
 

Or, if you examine it through more humanist eyes. Australians are descended from poor people who fought for their survival against a society with a rigid class structure that had no universal education, workers rights or universal suffrage. They were punished for stealing food by being sent to the other side of the planet and they built a nation that does have universal education, workers rights and universal suffrage.

New Zealanders on the other hand are descended from the younger sons of British landed gentry who could not expect to inherit any land because of their patriarchal inheritance codes. Despite all their advantages they built a nation not dissimilar to Australia.

To this day Australians tend to distrust authority and give respect only when it is earnt. Their greatest sporting rivals are whoever is world champion in any given sport at any given time (or whoever's second best if Australia is the world champion).

This is not an ozzie joke.

Re: New Zealand

 
 
Australian, or Ozzies, are a different breed entirely, the British part of them was shipped there in convict ships long ago.
 

Or, if you examine it through more humanist eyes. Australians are descended from poor people who fought for their survival against a society with a rigid class structure that had no universal education, workers rights or universal suffrage. They were punished for stealing food by being sent to the other side of the planet and they built a nation that does have universal education, workers rights and universal suffrage.

Clearly you just haven't put your minds to any recently.  
 
 
 
Meh.

Speaking of continents... look at this:

 

Seems like half of New Zealand (the upper bit, speaking from a northerhemispheriocentric point of view) is part of the Australian plate, while the lower bit is part of the Pacific plate.

Funny.

Also makes me kind of hungry.

Well, that is an interesting perspective. Never knew that about kiwis.
 
 
ain't no evidence in Kiwiland thet they's descended from some gentry!
 
 
This petty rivalry thing between Australasians is a bit pathetic.

And I must admit that Kiwis are far worse at perpetuating it.

Making sweeping statements about the ancestors of European NZers and Aussies is ludicrously meaningless.
 
 
Where would we (aussies) have been if not for the kiwi gunners at Long Tan. Worth their weight those men.

161 Battery and D company, Anzacs together.

I think that was a joke.

I thought it was ALL pretty much a joke?

I think the only time it was ever very serious was when whatshisname (the Australian cricket captain) ordered his bowler (another whatshisname) to do a bad bowl of some sort at the very end of a cricket game, so there was absolutely no chance of New Zilluin winning the match (they musta been very close.)

THAT nearly led to war.

Their names (only I can't remermber them) shall be remembered forever in infamy in history.
 
 
They were 2 of the 3 Chappell brothers; Greg Chappell as captain, and Trevor Chappell as bowler.

They're also remembered at the Adelaide Cricket Ground - and they've named stand after the Chappells, and their grandfather, Victor Richardson.

Were you there, dadpad?

I always remember being shown my great grandfather's name on the wall in the Auckland War Memorial Museum. He died of wounds received in 1918 in France. Still have a photo album of his that has many interesting shots taken on the troopship, in Egypt, then France.

I broke up a few fights in London that were just munted Kiwis and Ozzies having a poke for the mere sake of where they came from.

no I want I was much too young. google it long tan & Newzealand its a good read.
There was this rivalry thing going on even then. 161 battery worked non stop for 4 hours in the rain shelling as close as 10 m to aussie positions. When this ( working so damned hard for so long in the rain) was made mention of a few Aussie infantry dryly said... so?... they're used to that.

The Kiwis went in the back door at Galipoli.
So?... they're used to that.

But seriously were glad you came along for the ride cuz.

Guy I knew, his dad was in Vietnam. I asked him if he killed anyone and he said '4 Aussies'. Turns out they mucked up some shelling co-ordinates. Wonder if it was that unit..

'Wombat rape turned me Aussie'
March 27, 2008 03:00pm

A NEW Zealander has been sentenced to community work for telling police he was raped by a wombat and the experience had made him speak "Australian".

Arthur Ross Cradock, 48, from the South Island town of Motueka, called police on February 11 and told them he was being raped at his home by the wombat and he needed help, The Nelson Mail newspaper reported.

The orchard worker later called back and said: "Apart from speaking Australian now, I'm pretty all right, you know."

Cradock pleaded guilty in the local court to using a phone for a fictitious purpose. He was sentenced to 75 hours' community work.

Police prosecutor Sergeant Chris Stringer told the court alcohol played a large role in Cradock's life.
----------------------------

Leaves one speechless!  
 
 
There was some suggestion that it was Gus - using a nom-de-Kiwi!
 
 
Naahh.... If it was Gus, the wombat would've bought him dinner first.
 
 
 
Naahh.... If it was Gus, the wombat would've bought him dinner first.
 

Good grief woman!!! No wombat would fuck Gus! They're discerning beasts.
 
 
I was in Motueka the week after Feb 11 - quaint place but I could see people going stir crazy there.

That's fookin ridiculous but  
 
 
 
 
 
Australia's still the name of the continent, innit?
 

OMG I HEAR THAT SO MUCH, if I knew where you lived id kill you, damn New Zealand isnt part of aussie, we are two different countries, its like saying japan is part of china, get it?
 

But even if New Zealand isn't part of Australia (the country) or Australia (the continent), Australia is still the name of both the country and of the continent. Right?
 

Australasia or Oceania is the name of the continent, not Australia. (Including Papua New Guinea, Pasfic Island, Australia and NZ). Australia is only the name of Australia.
 
 
That depends on what continent model and nomenclature you subscribe to. It is called Oceania, Australasia and Australia.

Much of the English-speaking world teaches a 7-continent model and calls Australia a continent.

I've always found these continent arguments so very silly. It all started when a Japanese girl and I had a disagreement over how many continents there are. She claimed 6 (Japan teaches the 6-continent Eurasia model) and I considered it an incontrovertible truth that there were 7.

I then learned that there are a number of continent models and that there's no such thing as definitive authority on the matter. The interpretation of what the continents are is subjective.

Some people consider the Americas (North and South) one continent. Some consider Asia and Europe one continent. Others still consider Asia, Africa and Europe to be one continent.

Here is a animated map from Wikipedia illustrating the major continent models taught around the world:

NEW ZEALAND ASS WHIPPED THE AUSSIE SHAWHOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
 
 
You are showing way to much interest in our asses. Didn't see you crowing after the two tri nations games before that one.

Oh well I guess we'll get even in the next football world cup, oh that's right, you never qualify..... Well there's league. Oops. Hockey? Cricket? Basketball? Oh well, we can go per capita medal tallies at the olympics.

You do make nice sauvignon blanc though.

More seriously did you see the Gruen Transfer stuff?

It's about advertising with industry insiders and they have a segment where actual advertising agencies come up with campaigns to 'sell the unsellable'. A few weeks back a few kiwi hackles were raised when the campaigns were selling the idea of Australia invading New Zealand (pissfunny). As a semi payback last weeks job was the NZ govt funding a campaign to get tourists to choose NZ over Australia, also pissfunny.

I'll post the links in a sec...

Take this mate, New Zealand has 4 million people, just, sydney I believe has that alone, I may be wrong, also Aussie in a whole has 21 million?. So we have a choice out of 4 million and you have a choice out of 21 million? MMMMMM thats a bigger chance of getting more "skilled" players in sports.

Also I believe that I read in the newspaper once that the funding for sports such as Hockey, Basketball and all the rest is 20 times that of New Zealand, that would be caused by again the bigger population.

And! "Hockey? Cricket? Basketball?" Cricket?" I'm sorry I don't follow cricket as much as rugby but I do believe New Zealand is one of the best in the world if not the best, debatable who is better.

"Didn't see you crowing after the two tri nations games before that one" Sure you beat us 34-19, thats not a ass whipping, 39-10 is a major ass women, oh incase you forgot thats the score we got against you giving us a 1 point bonus putting us at the top of the table  

"You are showing way to much interest in our asses" Yea I am cuz its all I saw during the game while we were whipping and spanking it.

So I'm going to leave this little moan or fun conversation with you with a joke     (I think we both like a little rivalry   cheers from your mate across the ditch)

A KIWI BLOKE WAS ON EARTH DOING THE HAKA.....

Meanwhile somewhere in space Aliens were watching this unusual dance.
KAMATE KAMATE KA-ORA KA-ORA......

The Aliens were very interested in what must be going through his mind right at this moment and they wanted to see what would happen if they would take a part of his brain away without him even knowing!! So with the Aliens high-technology they sent a laser beam down that hit the Kiwi blokes head and took a part of his brain away. The Aliens then sat back to see what would happen....
KA-MATE KA-MATE, KA-ORA KA-ORA.......

???WHAT THE???
The Aliens were amazed with what they were seeing so they decided to send the beam down and take another part of his brain????.The Aliens watched on.
KA-MATE KA-MATE KA-ORA KA-ORA......

???WHAT THE???
The Aliens then figured these kiwis must be very clever people even with half a brain. So they wanted to see what would happen if they took the remainder of his brain away and left him with no knowledge what so ever! So with a push of a button the Aliens sent the beam down which took the final part of the Kiwis brain. Now surely he won't know anything at all, he should be too dumb to do anything now?

So the Aliens watched on as the bloke with no brains left then started singing,
WALTZING MATILDA, WALTZING MATILDA..........

The all blacks played super rugby. Good get NZ. and the 4 points as well.

I could not believe the turnaround.
 
 
Hi DB. Yep it's all jokes. But the population = sporting success formula is a crock or India would be a sporting superpower. It's only sport.

I got a joke for you too:

An expat Aussie, working in London was wandering the streets and stopped at an antique shop and decided to go in. On looking around he noticed a very strange looking bronze of a cat which had a tag on it saying, "Bronze Cat Â£30.00, Story Â£150.00". The man was very curious and asked the salesman to explain.

"Well" said the man, "its just like it says, Â£30 for the cat and Â£150 for its story". "I'll just take the cat", said the man. "Very well, but you will be back" said the salesman.

The man left the shop with the cat in his pocket. As he walked down the street he heard a strange mewing sound. On turning round he noticed there were a couple of cats following him. The further he walked the more cats seemed to appear to follow him. As he got to the Thames he turned to see about 1,000 cats behind him. "screw this" he said to himself and threw the bronze cat into the river. All the cats jumped into the river too and were drowned.

The man returned to the shop where he bought the cat. "I knew you would be back, Â£150.00 for the story" said the salesman. "stuff the story" said the man. "Have you got a bronze kiwi?"
 
 
India is in proverty though with not much funding for sports, the national sport, Cricket, which everyone plays they are good at but if you take chine for example, I beleive they will take out the total amount of medals won at the olympics.

There were 3 aussies and one New zealander in a bar. The aussies decide that it would be funny to piss the new zealander off."Ok, ok."Said the first one, "I know how to do it." He goes up to the NZer and says "Your Johana Lomu's a gay prick." The guy just shruggs and says "Ok." The next aussie goes up to him and says "your Johana Lomu's a transexual." again the kiwi doesnt seam to mind. the last guy goes up to him and says "Your Johna Lomu's an australian." The kiwi smiles. "i know, thats what your other friends have been trying to tell me."
 
 
Whats long and hard and F**ks Kiwis?

Primary school
 
 
 
Oh well I guess we'll get even in the next football world cup, oh that's right, you never qualify
 

We qualified for the olympics, lets settle it then  

A guy pulls up to a hotdog stand and says "I'll have 60 hotdogs thanks". The attendant asks "why so many?"
The man say "1 for me and 59 for the aussies in the back".
Again the attendant says "how did u fit 59 aussies in the back"
The man replys "its easy once you squeeze the bullshit out of them!"
 
 
By the way NZ has about twice as many registered union players as Australia - that's a better measure of over achievement.

Once upon a time in the Kingdom of Heaven, God went missing for six days. Eventually, Michael the archangel found him, resting on the seventh day.

He inquired of God, "Where have you been?"

God sighed a deep sigh of satisfaction and proudly pointed downwards through the clouds, "Look Michael, look what I've made."

Archangel Michael looked puzzled and said, "What is it?"

"It's a planet," replied God, "And I've put LIFE on it. I'm going to call it Earth and it's going to be a great place of balance."

"Balance?" inquired Michael, still confused. God explained, pointing to different parts of Earth.
"For example, Northern Europe will be a place of great opportunity and wealth while Southern Europe is going to be poor; the Middle East over there will be a hot spot.
Over there I've placed a continent of white people and over there is a continent of black people."

God continued, pointing to different countries. "And over there, I call this place America.
North America will be rich and powerful and cold, while South America will be poor, and hot and friendly. And the little spot in the middle is Central America, which is a hot spot. Can you see the balance?"

"Yes," said the Archangel, impressed by Gods work, then he pointed to a large landmass and asked, "What's that one?"

"Ah," said God. "That's Australia, the most glorious place on Earth. There are beautiful mountains, rainforests, rivers, streams and an exquisite coastline. The people are good-looking, intelligent and humorous and they're going to be found travelling the world.
They'll be extremely sociable, hard working and high achieving, and they will be known throughout the world as diplomats and carriers of peace.

I'm also going to give them super-human, undefeatable cricket, rugby and hockey players who will be admired and feared by all who come across them."

Michael gasped in wonder and admiration but then exclaimed - "But you said there would be BALANCE!"

God replied wisely, "Wait until you see the ugly, whingeing, sheep-rooting, Kiwi bastards I'm putting next to them."

50,000 Kiwis meet in Eden Park for a "Kiwis Are Not Stupid" Convention. Helen Clark says, "We are all here today to prove to the world thet Kiwis are not stupid. Ken I hev a volunteer."

Carlos Spencer gingerly works his way through the crowd and steps up to the stage. Helen asks him, "What uz fufteen plus fufteen?"

After fufteen or 20 seconds Carlos says, "Eighteen!"

Obviously everyone is a little disappointed. Then all 50,000 Kiwis start chanting,

"GUV HUM ANOTHER CHANCE! GUV HUM ANOTHER CHANCE!"

Helen says, "Well sunce we've gone to the trouble of gitting 50,000 of you un one place end we have the world wide priss end global broadcast media here, I thunk we ken guv hum another chance."

So she asks, "What uz sivven plus sivven?"

After nearly 30 seconds he eventually says, "Ninety!"

Helen is quite perplexed, looks down and just lets out a dejected sigh - everyone is disheartened. Carlos starts crying and the 50,000 Kiwis begin to yell and wave their hands shouting,

"GUV HUM ANOTHER CHANCE! GUV HUM ANOTHER CHANCE!"

Helen, unsure whether or not she is doing more harm than good, eventually says, "Ok! Ok! Just one more chance...What uz two plus two?"

Carlos closes his eyes, and after a whole minute eventually says, "Four!"

Throughout the stadium pandemonium breaks out as all 50,000 Kiwis jump to their feet, wave their arms, stamp their feet and scream...

"GUV HUM ANOTHER CHANCE! GUV HUM ANOTHER CHANCE!"
 
 
The Pope was touring Australia & took out a couple of days from
his itinerary to visit the northern tropics and the outback. Deep
into his visit, his 4WD Popemobile was driving alongside a river, when he
heard some splashing up ahead.

As he drew close, the Pope observed in the river, an Aboriginal
man struggling frantically with a crocodile, who had grasped the
poor guy in its powerful jaws.

At that moment, from around the river bend, a speedboat roared
into view, containing three people - Bruce Ruxton, Arthur Tunstall and
Pauline Hanson.

As the speedboat neared the struggling figures, Pauline Hanson
took aim and fired a harpoon into the crocodile's hide. Then Ruxton and
Tunstall pulled the man from the jaws of the crocodile and using long
clubs, beat the crocodile to death.

They bundled the semi-conscious man onto the speedboat, as well
as the dead croc and then approached the riverbank. The Pope was impressed
by what he had witnessed, so he went up to greet them. I give you my
blessings for your brave actions, he said. I had heard that there were some
racist xenophobic people trying to divide Australia's community - but now I
can see that your society is a truly enlightened example of racial harmony
and could serve as a model for other nations to follow.

As the Popemobile drove off, Pauline Hanson asked the others:
Who was that? Ruxton answered That was His Holiness the Pope. He is in
direct contact with God and has access to all God?s wisdom. Pauline
remarked, Well, he knows sweet f*ck-all about crocodile hunting!

What condition is the bait in?
 
 
The pope was touring New Zealand.

Nothing happened.
