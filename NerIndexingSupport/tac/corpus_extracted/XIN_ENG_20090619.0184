Senior official of the Communist Party of China (CPC) He Guoqiang met with
leaders of Spain's Popular Party (PP), a major opposition party in the country's
parliament, and Spanish Communist Party (PCE) on Tuesday.

While meeting with PP President Mariano Rajoy, He, member of the Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, said PP was an
important political force in Spain and made positive contribution to the growth
of China-Spain ties.

He said China appreciated PP's efforts to building China-Spain comprehensive
strategic partnership, which was established in 2005 when Chinese president Hu
Jintao visited Madrid.

He, also secretary of the CPC's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection,
said the CPC attached great importance to its exchange with the PP and would
like to increase party-to-party contacts, enhance mutual understanding between
the two peoples and promote a long-term and steady growth of bilateral ties.

Saying China was a country with a promising future, Rajoy hailed his party's
communication with the CPC as very helpful.

Rajoy briefed He on the recent European Parliament election, which took place in
early June in 27 member states of European Union (EU), and the latest
development of the European integration. Rajoy also gave He an analysis of how
the global financial crisis took a toll on Spain and the world.

In return, He introduced the impact of the crisis on China's economy and finance
as well as the country's responsive measures and their effects.

In another meeting with PCE General Secretary Francisco Frutos, He said PEC
played an important role in safeguarding Spain's political democracy, social
progress and laborers' rights. He said PCE made unremitting efforts to exploring
a socialist path that fits Spain's reality.

He reviewed the long-standing friendly exchanges between the CPC and the PCE,
which He said worked for the development of country- to-country ties.

Citing the CPC's great importance on ties with the PCE, He said the CPC would
like to deepen party-to-party friendly cooperation for the interests of both
countries and their peoples.

He said the CPC's pursuit of a socialism path with the Chinese characteristics
was the foremost experience in the party's rule of country over the last six
decades.

Frutos said the PCE and the CPC had some ideals in common, thus their exchange
of ideas and friendly cooperation would be significant for both parties' growth.

China's anti-graft chief arrived in Madrid on Monday after concluding an Egypt
tour. The fortnight visit will also take him to Jordan and Mongolia.
