I personally think that history begins when humans decide to act for the good of their descendants (EH Carr believes it to). The palestinian peoples have shown themselves to be wedded to violence and willing to sell thier chance of peace to the radical Islamists Hamas. Israel has every right to expell all palestinian peoples from its current claimed borders. Simalarly the protestant irish are a people unwilling to accept the majority view of the country they live in and accpet peace. The only longterm solution to both conflicts, regardless of the mid-term difficulties the actions may cause, is to expell both populations to more suitable countries. The Czezhs did it to their ethnic Germans after 1945 and the wider world barely batted an eyelid.

But the majority of people living in NI are protestants.   And it's also ridiculously unfair to state that this protestant majority are unwilling to accept peace - that may be true of some of Paisley's people but cannot be applied carte blanche as a realistic statement of fact. So FO you ingoramus.

Yeh, because then Israelis will be able to sleep sound of a night. Can't see that having any negative consequences whatsoever.

By your argument, why can't the Muslims expel the Israelis from the Middle East because the Israelis don't accept the 'majority view?'

Hold on a minute, who the ***** are you?

Firstly, protestants are the majority in the North of Ireland (barely), and secondly the conflict in the north wasnt down to just unionists, it was down to both sides, the IRA, UVF, UDA, INLA.. What I think your getting at is Protestant Irish are unwilling to accept the majority of the island, weither thats true or right or not can be left up to the individual reader.

Why the **** should a protestant who has lived in the north, grew up in the north, worked and gotten educated in the north be sent to a more "suitable" country? Thatcher had the same idea only it involved Irish catholics/nationalists, it didnt go down very well.

How about we expel ********s to another piece of land? you can be their president/monarch/whatever way you swing.

I remind you that your definition of 'country' is completely arbitrary. I could easily, using your exact logic, demand that Irish nationalists are driven into the sea for failing to accept the majority view of the country, ie the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.

Disturbingly enough, I could also apply this to socialists, gays, darkies and whatever other minority I felt like.
 
 
Don't feed the troll, lads.

LOL bigoted ignorance.
 
 
Indeed, the Palestinians are hypocrites. They want 3 Palestinian states:
1. They want the West Bank and the Gaza strip to be without Jews.
2, They want the kingdom of Jordan (Jordan is a Palestinian state with 80% Arabs who define themselves as Palestinians).
3. And they want the state of Israel to be a Muslim-Palestinian state, from the river to the sea.

Every right? What right? Israel has no right to claim the land it illegally occupies as Israel. The only right it has is the backing of the USA/UK which say it can exist, because it can...despite the fact it was majority Arab before the land was taken.

There really is no solution to this problem, without it ending in tradegy. That was always the purpose for Israels creation in Palestine, despite what you may think. It is serving its purpose very well at present, to polarize the people of the world, to create the whole Radical Islam vs the West scenario.

Its just a matter of time before the next major event happens, and Israel will once again be battling for "self defence" on the "war of terror".
