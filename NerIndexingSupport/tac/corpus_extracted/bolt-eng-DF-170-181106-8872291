 FOXNews.com - Video Shows USDA Official Saying She Didn't Give 'Full Force' of Help to White Farmer 

But FoxNews.com did run a story about the existence of the video, titled "Video Shows USDA Official Saying She Didn't Give 'Full Force' of Help to White Farmer" at 5:58 p.m. on Monday, an hour before the Agriculture Department announced Sherrods resignation. And Wednesday, Clemente told POLITICO that was a mistake.

"There was a breakdown in the system, and it is being addressed," he said. "But it must say something about the power of Fox, that a week after she resigned, we're still talking about this."

Fox loves the Islamic world so much that the TV news company is planning a 24-hour Arabic-language news channel. (an Arab prince is one of Fox's largest inventors and owners - Fox doesn't know where Egypt is - isn't that a hoot? Where's Iraq?)

There is no evidence they did anything other than make a bad decision. There is 0 evidence they knew the Full context of the tape. At best what you have here is Poor Judgment By a Conservative News Channel. They have already Apologized for Using Poor Judgment.

Hell it is Not like they Ran a completely Bogus story about a presidential Candidate on the Night before the Election in an attempt to influence the out come or anything.

Get over it Hippocrates.

You have NBC, ABC, CBS, CNN, NPR, MSNBC, CNBC, The Times, The Post, And on and on. You have Hollywood where Most of you get your Opinions about things from anyway, like the Lemmings you are. You have Academia, Where you Brain Wash our kids, You Dominate on the Internet even though you are a Minority in the country. You have most of the lower courts.

BACK the FUCK OFF OUR 1 Conservative Network.

Media Matters Much? Assholes.

It looks like they ran a story, in print on their web-page, and mentioned the existence of a video, and what it was about. They never ran the video, and I don't think the story appeared on their cable news show. Do you know for a fact that it did, RDean?

And it may have been an hour before they USDA announced it, but it was not an hour before Shirley pulled off the side of the road, and under duress, tendered her resignation. Nothing FNC did could have precipitated that, as your post implies.

Fox News Senior Vice President of News Michael Clemente said that Fox ran the story before she was asked to resign and he said that was a mistake. What else can you say. He's the Fox News Senior Vice President of News. Hello!

You would think that you guys would be more bothered by the FACT that Arabs are the fourth largest major shareholder at Fox. Prince "Abble dabble doo ddo" or whatever from Arabia works with Rupert Murdock (is he even American?) and has said he has gotten Fox to change their their "wording" AND Him and Rupert have joined forces, combining their shares to prevent a hostile take over.

Now, Fox is putting together an entire news organization in the Middle East with this guy. Prince "Whatever" who as said he was on the side of the those that brought down the WTC (creepy asshole fuck).

If you wanted to forment revolution inside a country, you would go after the dumb fucks and get them to hate their own country. So far, it's worked to perfection.

I wait for the day when Republicans start defending the Taliban.

Hey Mr. Taliban
tally me bananas
Daylight come and I want to go home.

Arabs are the fourth largest holder of Fox News.

 Trento?s Take: Fox News Can?t Upset Murdoch?s Saudi Prince 

I had said to Doocy that Saudi Arabian money was still financing Al Qaeda. Doocy did not react to my comment. But ten days later I learned that Foxs parent company, News Corporation, was, at the time of my interview, negotiating with a Saudi prince to vastly increase his stake in the company.

The notorious Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, nephew to the Saudi king, met with Rupert Murdoch in Hong Kong on Jan. 14. The prince issued a press release after the meeting stating that the princes Kingdom Holding Company had discussions that "touched upon future potential alliances with News Corp."

By the time I appeared on Fox News, Prince Alwaleed was about to become News Corps fourth largest voting shareholder (behind the Murdoch family, Liberty Media, and Fidelity Management & Research Co, a mutual fund). The prince has repeatedly defended his homeland as a problem-free place. What he has failed to mention is that he has personally donated huge amounts of money to the families of Palestinian suicide bombers.

* It still doesnt prove THEY LIED nor does it prove Brietbart lied... it is just an admition that they should have sat on story a little longer.
It doesnt disprove Brietbart either. Talk about grasping at straws.

You would think that you guys would be more bothered by the FACT that Arabs are the fourth largest major shareholder at Fox. Prince "Abble dabble doo ddo" or whatever from Arabia works with Rupert Murdock (is he even American?) and has said he has gotten Fox to change their their "wording" AND Him and Rupert have joined forces, combining their shares to prevent a hostile take over.

* What does this have to do with Fox supposedly lying  

Now, Fox is putting together an entire news organization in the Middle East with this guy. Prince "Whatever" who as said he was on the side of the those that brought down the WTC ( creepy asshole fuck ).
* I agree with ya there.... this is a bad idea for Fox.

If you wanted to forment revolution inside a country, you would go after the dumb fucks and get them to hate their own country. So far, it's worked to perfection.

* Yep... this is exactly what is going on in the mainstream media at this very moment in America. They have convinced you lefties that America sucks and it needs to be "fundamentally changed". They are the only ones telling the truth??? Yeah right!

I wait for the day when Republicans start defending the Taliban.

* Why wait for the Repubs to do it, when your party is already doing it  

Hey Mr. Taliban
tally me bananas
Daylight come and I want to go home.

* btw:
Harry bellafuko is a dictator loving POS

 

* Just saying....
 
 
Yeah. He admits the truth. Shocker. It's the same thing we've been saying since the beginning. The Administration demanded her resignation before Fox aired the story.

Fox airing the story at 5:58pm is still after the White House demanded the resignation. You see, Glenn Beck airs at 5pm. 5:58pm would be the news at the Top of the Hour after Glenn Beck. She was told to resign before Glenn Beck aired.

Do the math.

BTW, isn't it amusing that for nearly two weeks we've been asking for evidence that Fox aired anything before OReilly, not a single person could reference it until after Fox admits it on their own? Those evil decievers. Trying to mislead people by telling them the truth. Someone ought to shut them up.

The left's argument that the White House demanded her resignation because of Fox news utterly fails by your own timeline. Face it, the Administration acted stupidly.

Mostly? The Taliban is a home grown Afghan Group, Afghan is almost completely not ARAB   These Fools are so ignorant they think everyone from Sudan to Pakistan is an Arab.
 
 
The right wing dumb fucks are at it again. Who said the Taliban are Arabs? I said I couldn't wait until the right starts supporting the Taliban. We may already be there.

No, I said Arab Prince, "Ala Kazam (spelling?)" is the fourth largest owner of Fox News. I asked if Rupert Murdoch is even a citizen?

And The Right Wing's Arab Prince, owner of their "secular Bible", gives money to the families of "suicide bombers".

What is wrong with you people? Have you lost it completely? Supporting a so called news organization that is owned by our enemies?

SO THEY SLANDERED AN AMERICAN AND WORK FOR THE ARABS. NICE!

 

Wow, the left pays so much attention to Fox that someone can get fired an hour after Fox airs a story. Talk about a rush to judgment.

 

Is anyone paying any attention to REALITY here? Sherrod was fired an hour BEFORE Fox ran the story. They hadn't even run it yet. She was fired after the administration just HEARD this story was going to run on the Beck show -and did so without bothering to find out the full facts for themselves and without bothering to ask Sherrod what she had said and the context in which she said them. Which they should have done. Their overreaction isn't Fox's fault.

And as I point out elsewhere, even Fox missed the entire point Breitbart even had this video on his website -which was NOT about Sherrod. He included enough video that if someone had watched the entire clip they would have known exactly where Sherrod was going with her story. The video showing Sherrod finally talking about her epiphany that it wasn't "so much" about black and white and more about "have and have nots" also came from his site too. He put this clip on his website to show the total hypocrisy of the NAACP which claimed all Tea Party members were racists with zero evidence of any such thing.

And he did it by showing a video clip of a guest speaker talking about deliberately mistreating a poor white farmer for no reason but the fact he was white -NOT in order to attack Sherrod because HE knew where she was going with this story. It was the NAACP audience that did not know where she was going with it and the clip was about the audience -who were NAACP members. The entire time Sherrod was talking about having discriminated against a white farmer just because he was white -the audience - all NAACP members -were nodding their heads in approval and saying "alright" and "oh yeah", obviously ENJOYING hearing about her racist beliefs, her racist practice and decision to discriminate against a white -and approving of it. They LOVED the racism -but only so long as it is blacks discriminating against whites of course. Any other audience who had heard someone talk about discriminating against someone because of their race would have gasped and been appalled. Not the NAACP members in this clip though -they were loving it. Ever heard any NAACP official apologize for the racist display of NAACP members in that audience? Of course not and you never will. And THAT is what Breitbart still says was the real story and is still ignored by all the media. I agree with him. The NAACP is a bunch of hypocritical bigots of the worst sort -who rationalize, justify and excuse their own BLATANT racism while insisting it is others who never even mentioned race at all that are the "real" racists and insisting all their political opponents adhere to a standard they don't even pretend to be capable of attaining themselves.

So you agree it was good to "slander" this woman? For committing the crime of "helping people"? Are you one of those "right wingers" who refer to themselves as a "good Christian"? How does supporting "slander" make you "good"? I would think it makes you a "nasty fuck".
 
 
first off, does simply posting a videotape (unedited in the sense that he did not change any of her words) constitute slander? hsi point was to highlight the reaction of the crowd. if his only goal was to harm sherrod, he would not have included the part where she said "i learned it was more than about black and white"

this was only a big story because this administration is apparently afraid of showing up on the chalk board of a recovering alcoholic.
 
 
 
So after all this denial, FOX admits they ran the Sherrod story before she resigned.

 

No. They admitted they ran the story at 5:58pm. Which was atleast an hour after the White House forced her resignation.

Dan Rather makes a "bad decision" and loses his job.

Fox makes a "bad decision" and gets a free pass.

My god.

 

an obvious conservative with an agenda and a history of going after left-leaning entities posts a video on his website, and within hours a woman is forced to resign under pressure from the white house and the naacp. given all the discussion of race in the previous weeks, fox first airs this story at 8:45 pm. the very next day glenn beck (the very person the administration was afraid of) and charles krauthammer defend sherrod on fox and other anchors apologize for following the lead of the obama administration.

how does that compare with dan rather?
 
 
 
 
Wow, the left pays so much attention to Fox that someone can get fired an hour after Fox airs a story. Talk about a rush to judgment.

 

Is anyone paying any attention to REALITY here? Sherrod was fired an hour BEFORE Fox ran the story. They hadn't even run it yet. She was fired after the administration just HEARD this story was going to run on the Beck show -and did so without bothering to find out the full facts for themselves and without bothering to ask Sherrod what she had said and the context in which she said them. Which they should have done. Their overreaction isn't Fox's fault.

And as I point out elsewhere, even Fox missed the entire point Breitbart even had this video on his website -which was NOT about Sherrod. He included enough video that if someone had watched the entire clip they would have known exactly where Sherrod was going with her story. The video showing Sherrod finally talking about her epiphany that it wasn't "so much" about black and white and more about "have and have nots" also came from his site too. He put this clip on his website to show the total hypocrisy of the NAACP which claimed all Tea Party members were racists with zero evidence of any such thing.

And he did it by showing a video clip of a guest speaker talking about deliberately mistreating a poor white farmer for no reason but the fact he was white -NOT in order to attack Sherrod because HE knew where she was going with this story. It was the NAACP audience that did not know where she was going with it and the clip was about the audience -who were NAACP members. The entire time Sherrod was talking about having discriminated against a white farmer just because he was white -the audience - all NAACP members -were nodding their heads in approval and saying "alright" and "oh yeah", obviously ENJOYING hearing about her racist beliefs, her racist practice and decision to discriminate against a white -and approving of it. They LOVED the racism -but only so long as it is blacks discriminating against whites of course. Any other audience who had heard someone talk about discriminating against someone because of their race would have gasped and been appalled. Not the NAACP members in this clip though -they were loving it. Ever heard any NAACP official apologize for the racist display of NAACP members in that audience? Of course not and you never will. And THAT is what Breitbart still says was the real story and is still ignored by all the media. I agree with him. The NAACP is a bunch of hypocritical bigots of the worst sort -who rationalize, justify and excuse their own BLATANT racism while insisting it is others who never even mentioned race at all that are the "real" racists and insisting all their political opponents adhere to a standard they don't even pretend to be capable of attaining themselves.

 

And the NAACP coming out at the end of the same day she was fired, approvingy; that was just a deflection away from their own display of racism, and that after a week of their charging racism against "some in" the Tea Party movement, demanding they be called out.

And the administsration fires Sherrod, because she was better to scapegoat than to let the NAACP be rightly castigated for their display earlier of innate racism, by cheering her on, when they thought she was telling a story of racial "get even with 'em-ism"

And all that, too goes back to their investment in calling the Tea Party racists, and keeping that bull-crap alive, leading up to an election, now 95 days away.
 
 
 
 
 
I bet you read MediaMatters, Huffington Post & Politico, and I bet you watch CNN and MSNBC and the rest of their ilk..... SO STFU idiot.

 

Uh, dumbass, do you know how to use a "search engine"?

Go to "Google" or any search engine and type in the words:

"arab owned fox news"

hit enter

then come back and tell us what you find.  

 

so, all Arabs are our enemies?

thanks for exposing yourself as a bigot

 

While I didn't say "all Arabs are our enemies", I can say, "all people like you are fucking morons". Wait, does that mean you are having sex with morons or you ARE a moron? You figure it out.
 
 
I was unaware that Arabs were my enemies.

Silly me. I thought we were fighting radical muslim terrorists regrdless of ethnicity.

Note that Rdean is completely ignore the timeline where Ms Sherrod was forced to resign over an hour before Fox aired anything about her.

If the Vice President of Arab owned Fox News says they fucked up, I believe him, this one time. You? Not so much.

I completely believe him. But then, I am not the one trying to pretend that his statements mean that Fox is somehow responsible for Sherrod being forced to resign when the White House did it atleast an hour before the first Fox broadcast of the story.

See, in Elementry school, I learned some very useful skills. Telling time for one. Addition and subtraction for another.

And I am fairly certian that someone being asked to resign before 5pm cannot have been caused by a story except that wasn't mention until 5:58pm in passing.

Well, if Shirley sues, and it looks like she will, I guess we'll find out the real timeline, won't we?
 
 
When I point out the Arab owner of Fox News supported the 9/11 terrorist and gives money to the families of suicide bombers the right gets so upset?

On one hand, I never said "all Arabs",

Yet, on the other hand, I get the feeling supporters of Fox News are defending the terrorists. Are they or are they not?
 
 
They dont care that they are being manipulated by foreign entities.

They just want to hang onto their failed ideas.

Any lie from anyone is fine with them.

Are you suggesting we shouldn't believe Shirley when she said she was forced to resign prior to 5pm?

Or are you suggesting that Fox is really lying and was playing it earlier then this current time?

I see no evidence to suggest we don't already know the real timeline. Do you have any evidence that the timeline is different? If not, your accusations just don't hold up.

Fox News should run fake or out of context videos of everyone in the Obama administration including the Bamster. Because apparently they get fired before anyone checks to see if they're legit.

Fox News Senior Vice President of News Michael Clemente said that Fox ran the story before she was asked to resign and he said that was a mistake. What else can you say. He's the Fox News Senior Vice President of News. Hello!

You would think that you guys would be more bothered by the FACT that Arabs are the fourth largest major shareholder at Fox. Prince "Abble dabble doo ddo" or whatever from Arabia works with Rupert Murdock (is he even American?) and has said he has gotten Fox to change their their "wording" AND Him and Rupert have joined forces, combining their shares to prevent a hostile take over.

Now, Fox is putting together an entire news organization in the Middle East with this guy. Prince "Whatever" who as said he was on the side of the those that brought down the WTC (creepy asshole fuck).

If you wanted to forment revolution inside a country, you would go after the dumb fucks and get them to hate their own country. So far, it's worked to perfection.

I wait for the day when Republicans start defending the Taliban.

Hey Mr. Taliban
tally me bananas
Daylight come and I want to go home.

yawn
 
 
 
 
 
more proof you are a fucking moronic idiot
the blatant lies you tell

 

Which one is the lie, Muffdiver? Well? I'm waiting?

Are YOU Taliban?

 

hey dipshit, the Taliban are NOT Arabs
you show once again you dont know what the fuck you are babbling about

 

No, but the fourth largest owner of Fox news is an Arab. And he gives money to the families of suicide bombers and was on the side of those that brought down the WTC.

So which are you defending? Him or the Taliban?

Ironically, they don't get fired for the clips that are in context and much more damning.
