Press watchdog IPI condemned Wednesday the murder of a Somali journalist, whose
bullet-riddled and mutilated body was discovered in the capital Mogadishu.

"This murder is a barbaric waste, first of human life, and secondly of a
seasoned journalist in a country that now more than ever needs the skills of
veteran reporters," IPI director David Dadge said in a statement.

The International Press Institute called "on all parties in this conflict to
stop attacking and killing journalists from all media and to respect the
importance of their work in creating peace."

The body of Nur Abkey, a journalist for government-owned Radio Mogadishu, was
discovered Tuesday but it was unclear who had abducted and killed him,
colleagues said.

Abkey was the first journalist to be killed this year in Somalia, one of the
most dangerous countries for journalists worldwide, IPI noted.

Last year, nine journalists were killed there by armed militias, who also often
kidnap foreign reporters for ransom.
