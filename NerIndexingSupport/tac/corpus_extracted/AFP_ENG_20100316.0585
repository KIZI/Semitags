The remains of two Australian soldiers who died during secret operations inside
Indonesia more than 40 years ago have been found and positively identified,
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said Tuesday.

Rudd told parliament the remains of Lieutenant Kenneth Hudson and Private Robert
Moncrieff, both of the Special Air Service Regiment (SASR), would be returned to
Australia.

The men were swept away during a river crossing in Indonesian Borneo on March
21, 1966 as they took part in clandestine border security operations.

"Despite extensive searches at the time they were not found," Rudd said.

"Now their remains can be brought home to their final resting place in
Australia."

Australian and British troops were involved in secret border security operations
from 1965-66 during a small, undeclared war between Indonesia and Malaysia
triggered by the 1963 Federation of Malaysia.

The Australian soldiers conducted extensive operations on both sides of the
border and were involved in clashes with Indonesian units as they attempted to
ensure Malaysia's security.

The Australian army began an attempt to find the men's remains in 2008 and the
Indonesian military agreed to assist in the search the following year.

Rudd thanked the Indonesian armed forces for their cooperation in helping find
the remains of Hudson, who was 30 when he died, and Moncrieff, then 21, who had
been respectfully buried by locals a few kilometres apart.
