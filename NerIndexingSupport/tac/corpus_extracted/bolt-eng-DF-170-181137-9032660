Have I ever mentioned how much I hate LSU?

LSU 30
UNC 24

 LSU Tigers vs. North Carolina Tar Heels - Box Score - September 04, 2010 - ESPN 
 
 
Fuck LSU..

Yeah, I agree. Fuck LSU. In other news...

Hotty Toddy, gosh almighty, who the heck is Jacksonville State? Flim flam, bim bam, the team that beat Ole Miss, by damn!
 
 
Jacksonville beat Ole Miss?

What the?
 
 
Bahahahahahha, Jackson St beating Ole Piss couldn't have happened to a bigger ass wipe of a coach.

and yes Miles is a lucky fucker, but it can't all be luck, he's done it for several years now. And I hate the corn dogs.

I like Les Grossman myself.
 
 
LSU has two National titles this decade because we get the best athletes and coaches.

Roll tide, around the hole and down the bowl.

We? What position do you play?
 
 
I live in Louisiana and was tempted to root for NC, of course that pea brain coach punting on 4th and a hair in the 2nd quarter pissed me off so they didn't deserve the win either,imho.

It's true. They are both decent coaches, the only difference is Miles gets the breaks when he needs them, while the ball bounces the wrong way for Nutt every time.

I can't stand the corn dogs, but Nutt isn't anywhere near Miles' league in coaching. Ole Piss is going to start finding that out as they start playing more Nutt recruited teams.

I thought you were insulting Miles. D'oh!

No, I was saying that neither is a great coach, neither is a horrible coach. They both do stupid things. Miles pay off, Nutt's blow up in his face.

Suddenly, I'm from Alabama. Wow.

Miles' record is based mostly on recruits that Saban brought to the team. Deal with that. I don't know a single legitimate LSU fan that supports Les Miles. The guy is a hack. You're a fucking moron. And LSU is going to be embarrassed by finishing just above Ole Miss but behind Mississippi State in the West this year.

Saban has won two National championships, with his recruits. Miles won one with Saban's recruits. Do the math or have someone do it for you.

I'm an accountant, I can help with this math problem.

What do you get when you add one dumbass LSU coach and one dumbass LSU fan?

Answer: Delusion.

Delusion and two fuckers that have over dosed on corn dogs.

Remind me again Jon, aren't we 3-0 in our last 3 vs Leslie?

No, they beat us last year in OT because of a missed field goal by Tejada.
 
 
you bama cousin marriers are a riot. Miles has a better winning percentage and better bowl record than Saban had at LSU.

Oh, and who inherited a MUCH better program ? Yeah pretty sure that would be Leslie.

Again, we're not Bama fans, faggot. Well, CrimsonWhite is, but ConHog and I clearly are not.

But still, you can continue to argue for Les Miles all you want. No one who knows anything about football is going to agree with you. Saban outranks Miles on every imaginable characteristic that makes a good football coach. Live with it, or kill yourself. I don't care either way.
