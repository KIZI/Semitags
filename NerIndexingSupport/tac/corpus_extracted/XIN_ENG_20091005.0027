Jordan said on Monday it is exhausting all diplomatic channels to halt
violations against Al Aqsa Mosque by Jewish extremists, which triggered clashes
that led to the injuries and arrests of many Palestinians.

Jordan is exerting intensive efforts with Arab, Muslim and European Union
countries and permanent members of the UN Security Council to put an end to the
violations, Prime Minister Nader Dahabi was quoted by the state Petra news
agency as saying.

Jerusalem is a red line, said the prime minister, adding that " We are all angry
regarding what is happening against Al Aqsa Mosque."

In protest of the arrests and injuries of Palestinians in the clashes with the
Israeli police, Jordan on Sunday summoned the Israeli ambassador in Amman and
handed over a letter protesting the Israeli measures against Al Aqsa Mosque.

Last week, confrontations broke out between Palestinians and the Israeli police
as a group of Jewish radicals broke into the holy mosque, a flashpoint site in
Jerusalem sacred to both Muslims and Jews. Several Israeli police were also
injured in the clashes.

On Monday, Israel deployed thousands of security forces in and around Jerusalem
to prevent the outbreak of clashes anew, according to media reports.

The Wadi Araba peace treaty signed between Israel and Jordan in 1994 says
"Israel respects the present special role of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in
Muslim Holy shrines in Jerusalem."
