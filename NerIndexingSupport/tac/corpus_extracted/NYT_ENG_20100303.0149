The Denver Broncos tendered contracts to five of their
six restricted free agents Wednesday, but the team's five players --
Elvis Dumervil, Kyle Orton, Brandon Marshall, Chris Kuper and Tony
Scheffler -- are not exactly happy.

None of them figure to sign those tenders any time soon.

Two, Marshall and Scheffler, are set up to be traded. The other
three -- Dumervil, Orton and Kuper -- are likely to consider joining
the dozens of fourth- and fifth-year NFL restricted free agents in
holding out from offseason workouts.

The only potential restricted free agent not tendered a contract
by the Broncos was backup defensive end Le Kevin Smith. He may have
been the only one of the group who would have been happy with a
tender. Instead, he becomes an unrestricted free agent -- which is
what the other five players wish they had the opportunity to try.

"It's bittersweet," said Leo Goeas, Kuper's agent. "Chris
likes being there, he likes being a Bronco. A lot of this is out of
his control. The good thing about this is the Broncos sent the
message with that first-round tender that they value him and they
don't want him leaving. The other side is by putting such a high
tender on him, it does limit his opportunities."

It promises to be another tumultuous offseason at Broncos'
headquarters.

Dumervil is the player the Broncos most coveted, and most feared
losing. The team acted accordingly by slapping the highest tender
of first- and third-round compensation on the NFL's sack leader.
Should another team lure away Dumervil with a lucrative deal, that
team would have to compensate the Broncos with a first- and
third-round pick in the upcoming NFL draft. Teams seldom give up
that much for any player.

Last July, Baltimore avoided losing Terrell Suggs to free agency
by signing the outside linebacker to a six year, $62.5 million
contract, $38.1 million of which is guaranteed.

Suggs had eight sacks in the season leading into free agency.
Dumervil had 17.

Dumervil would have been an unrestricted free agent this
offseason until a breakdown in the league's collective bargaining
agreement changed the rules. Now, fourth- and fifth-year players --
as is the case with the Broncos' five players -- are not
unrestricted, but restricted free agents.

As a restricted free agent, Dumervil is guaranteed only a
one-year, $3.168 million deal.

Three other Broncos -- Orton, Marshall and Kuper -- received the
next highest tender of first-round draft pick compensation.
First-round compensation, though, had different meanings.

For a potential superstar like Marshall, who is coming off three
consecutive 100-catch seasons, or Orton, a three-year starting QB,
a first-round tender could invite teams to go after them.

But for Kuper, who plays at a relatively lower-paid position, a
first-round tender would be considered all-but prohibitive for
other teams to pursue.

Scheffler received the lowest tender of "original round"
compensation. Although Scheffler was a second-round pick in the
2006 draft, by designating him as an "original round" restricted
free agent instead of "second round" restricted free agent, the
Broncos are guaranteeing his pay at $1.176 million instead of
$1.759 million. That's nearly a $600,000 shove to the edge of the
trading plank.

Many agents already have recommended that their restricted
free-agent clients skip the team's offseason workout sessions. The
agents don't want these players in harm's way in case a new
collective bargaining agreement changes their status from
restricted free agency to unrestricted free agency.
