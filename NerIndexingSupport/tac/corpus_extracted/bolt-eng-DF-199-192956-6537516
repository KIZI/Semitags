We just helped a relative sell their TX vs. OU tickets online.

In a normal year, these will go for $300-400 each. When Texas is #5 and OU is #1? Double that.

We managed to sell four tickets for $650.
 
 
Might as well spend your money the way you like it before our currency becomes less valuable. LOL

Did you hear? Bush said today that we're going to work with "our European friends." What ever happened to king George?
 
 
For years I've been joking about how I've been looking forward to the economic apocalypse coming along and rampant inflation making my debt meaningless.

Fingers crossed....
