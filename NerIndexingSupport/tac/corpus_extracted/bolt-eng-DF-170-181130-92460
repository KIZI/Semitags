there has been a lot going on already, and, lets be serious, a great deal more is to come soooooo instead of starting a thread every time the € has a bad day, eats its own, or some such junior calamity on the way to the cataclysmic calamity occurs, we can just post it here and take it all in like we are at the Imax  

so, I'll go first-

interesting blurb from the BI- I was wondering why they just didn't cut Greece loose now......right now, now I know, Eurobonds!!!!Hey don't shove..get back in line, theres debt enough to go round.

they plan on doing to the whole EU what our own did to us ( comparatively), make us eat the banks failures ala our 401ks, etc. the whole EU not just the krauts (   ) will now get to pay to eat Greece like a buffett and the banks get to eat and walk away and leave the checks for the saps....  

snip-

The reason leaders want to get Greece to the ESM stage is that it entails some sort of orderly restructuring of the country's debt, where private creditors will take part in the deal. There is the potential that the ESM could swap its debt to creditors in exchange for the sovereign debt they are holding. Essentially, that's a eurobond in exchange for a Greek bond, in everything but name. This has not yet been agreed to, and will likely garner significant political opposition.

All the big money is going to be in a scramble to keep retail investors on board until they can cash out.

Greece shouldn't be bailed out right now. They broke the convenants on their last bail out. All this is doing is punting the problem down the road a couple of months.
 
 
The euro as we know it is finished. It is untenable.

Either the political structure has to change such that funds are constantly flowing from the north to the south or the weak countries will leave. There are no other options, unless the PIIGS are to become German copycats.

Its amusing when the market rallies "On a Greek bailout." How many times has that happened over the past year? Seven?

I didn't laugh. I may disagree but I don't laugh. I've been in the business too long to know that anything can happen. Last survey I checked had 97% of money managers bearish on Treasuries. And though I'm one of them, when that many are on one side of the boat, it gives me pause.

Anyways, the Europeans are doing their best to keep this game of three-card monty going.

 
Greece’s next aid package may include incentives for bondholders to roll over maturing debt without triggering a credit-rating downgrade that would roil Europe’s banking system, two people with knowledge of the talks said.

Investors may be offered preferred status, higher coupon payments or collateral as inducements to buy bonds replacing Greek debt maturing between 2012 and 2014, said the people, who declined to be identified because the talks are in progress.

The sweeteners would be part of a revised aid package, to be decided by the end of June, amounting to a voluntary extension of Greece’s debt maturities that aims to skirt the technical definition of default, the people said.

Spiegel Reports Greek Bailout #2 To Surpass €100 Billion

It's the weekend, which means another Spiegel hit piece over the solvency and stability of the Eurozone is overdue. Sure enough, the publication comes through admirably with "New Greek aid to cost more than one hundred billion euros." As a reminder, until as recently as 24 hours ago it was expected that the bailout would be at most €80 billion, with half coming from Greek privatization efforts. Naturally, this means that even more money will be transferred from taxpayer pockets to bank capital deficiency accounts. Next up: Greek bailouts 3, 4, 5, by which point Goldman will have hopefully achieved its life long ambition of opening a Goldman Sachs-branded ATM at the main entrance to the Acropolis, which GS will have LBOed using discount window capital.

As for the photo from a May 30 protest which accompanies the Spiegel piece, it is sadly amusing that the Greek lady next to the EU Swastika flag is wearing designer glasses and a gold watch.

Merkel Changes Stance on Aid to Greece

BERLIN — Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany retreated Friday from demands that private financial institutions be pressured to participate in efforts to rescue the Greek economy, a compromise that seemed to offer some breathing space in Europe’s efforts to confront its potentially ruinous debt crisis.

Her critics in the European Central Bank and in many European capitals had argued that any requirement that private investors absorb some losses risked plunging Greece into a disorderly default on its enormous debt.

But after a two-hour meeting with President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, whose banks are among the most heavily exposed in the Greek debt crisis, Mrs. Merkel relented, saying, “We would like to have a participation of private creditors on a voluntary basis.” She acknowledged, too, that there was no legal way of forcing banks to participate.

“This should be worked out jointly with the E.C.B,” she added, referring to the European Central Bank. “There shouldn’t be any dispute with the E.C.B. on this.” It was her second major political reversal in a month and could compound her political woes at home.

Because it is summer and the weather is nice. I am going to Italy in August to visit some family. If you want to wait for a better exchange rate, I expect parity with the dollar over the next few years.
 
 
Personally. I would tell the Greeks to figure out their own problems. They got themselves into it. If they want to stay with the euro, fine. But we are not going to bail you out. We are not throwing good money after bad. Europe should take the money they are giving to Greece (which is just going to default later anyway) and bail out their financial system directly. Let bondholders lose and realize they actually have to pay attention to what they invest in. Are these guys creditworthy?

It is like loaning your rotten brother-in-law money. You do it to keep peace in the family, but there comes a point when it helps neither him nor you.
 
 
 
So, you put our entire retirement account into Greek bonds because they were paying such a high rate of interest? What other brilliant things have you done recently that you want to tell me about?

Moody's Puts Italy's Aa2 Rating On Downgrade Review, EUR Slides, And A Bonus Report From SocGen: "How Vulnerable Is Italy?"

RATIONALE FOR REVIEW

First, the Italian economy faces growth challenges in an environment characterized by long-term structural impediments to growth and potentially rising interest rates. Structural economic weaknesses -- mainly low productivity and important labour and product market rigidities -- have been a major impediment to growth in the last decade and continue to hinder the economy's recovery from the severe recession it experienced in 2009. Italy has so far only recovered a fraction of the nearly seven percentage points in GDP that it lost during the global crisis, despite low interest rates, which are likely to rise in the medium term. Growth prospects for the Italian economy in the coming years will be a crucial factor that will determine the government's revenues and the achievement of fiscal consolidation targets.

Second, there are implementation risks to the fiscal consolidation plans that are required to reduce Italy's stock of public debt to more affordable levels. Against a backdrop of rising interest rates and weak economic growth, the government may find it difficult to generate the primary surpluses that are needed to place the public debt-to-GDP ratio and the interest burden on a solid downward trend. The adoption of additional conservative fiscal policies may prove more difficult in the near future because the current government's electoral support is weakening, with the government facing challenges in gaining public approval for its policies. For example, the government's recent energy and water supply proposals were rejected by popular vote.

Third, the fragile market sentiment that continues to surround European sovereigns with high levels of debt poses additional risks for Italy. The continued stability of market demand for Italy's debt is uncertain at current yields. Although future policy actions within the euro area could reduce investors' concerns and stabilize funding costs, the opposite is also possible. In any event, going forward, investors appear likely to differentiate more among euro area sovereign borrowers than they did prior to the financial crisis, to the disadvantage of euro area countries with higher-than-average debt burdens, like Italy.

I am generally a contrarian investor- I go the opposite of the herd. When I bought the long bond in February, the bearish sentiment was at 97% (the market was convinced that long term interest rates would rise). China may have helped, I really don't know.

Greece Deputy PM Warns Of Tanks In The Streets, Mass Suicides, If Second Bailout Voted Down By Greek Parliament

With just days left until the crucial vote on passing the Greek mid-term austerity package, the assured destruction rhetoric used by the Greek status quo has hit fever pitch. Just to make sure the message is not lost on the broader population that Europe's banks will not admit defeat in a vote that could end the kleptocratic cartel's hegemony for ever, Greece's Deputy Prime Minister Theodoros Pangalos has blasted suggestions that it would be better for his country to abandon the euro and return to the drachma as an "immense stupidity". He didn't stop there. For dramatic impact, the Greek vice PM also said that the country would devolve into complete anarchy, with tanks roaming the streets, a population on the verge of civil war, with mass suicides, just for dramatic impact, should bankers not get their way. More or less in line with the Hank Paulson script that is regurgitated every few years when the Ponzi system is on the verge of imploding yet again.

From AFP:

"Those who say this are extremely stupid. While they may be analysts, university professors or economists, saying that is an immense stupidity," Pangalos told daily Spanish newspaper El Mundo in an interview published Sunday.

Debt-wracked Greece has been told by European peers that it cannot hope to continue receiving aid from a 110-billion-euro rescue package agreed with the EU and the IMF last year without biting budget reforms and privatisations.

The Greek parliament will vote on an austerity package this week but some economists have argued that Athens needs to restructure its debt and leave the euro to become economically competitive again.

"Returning to the drachma would mean that on the following day banks would be surrounded by terrified people trying to withdraw their money, the army would have to protect them with tanks because there would not be enough police," said Pangalos.

"There would be riots everywhere, shops would be empty, some people would throw themselves out the window... And it would also be a disaster for the entire European economy."

so here we go, Italy next up in the box.............damn spaghetti benders...Italy has just put a rule in place to halt or limit closely bank short selling.......cost of insuring Italian sovereign debt rose to an all time high.
 
 
Spain is in trouble again too.
 
 
Today was about Italy.

In some ways, it's fairly odd, given that Italy doesn't have a big deficit and has been reducing it's deficit over time. It didn't have a big bubble and it's banks aren't distressed, or at least not more so than other European banks. However, it was the third slowest growing economy in the world over the past decade, with only Zimbabwe and another country worse. It has negative productivity and a lot if debt.

I hear you but I see this as I am sure you as part and parcel of the contagion they simply cannot handle....the IMF wants us to up our contributions for greece et al, Spain? Italy? (Portugal is lost to them period)

The Euro house of cards is folding, merkel may have already committed political suicide and the German people will reached their limit if they already are not there yet.

Oh and Italy has a HUUUUUUUUUGE off the books cash economy. I doubt they collect half the taxes they could.
 
 
well Greece misses more benchmarksFitch has downgraded them again.......Ireland is in junk status now too......well, heres the IMF to the rescue ( with OUR money too)....*sigh*

just dump Greece, Merkel save yourself my kleingebäck, pick up the phone get with Sark and just fucking dump their asses.

interesting article.....

The Euro Endgame
At last, the voters
Aug 1, 2011,

Billion by billion by billion, showdown by argument by ultimatum, Greece’s latest bailout is being put together by those who run the eurozone. The country’s finances are so bad, and its prospects so poor, that even the new $159 billion rescue package announced on Thursday will (assuming it comes into effect) probably only prove to be a reprieve.

Never mind. Buying time is the name of the game. If Greece can be kept going, and Portugal and Ireland too, financial markets might, fingers crossed, calm down, and the threat that panic might engulf Spain and Italy—two economies too big to bail—and the banks that have lent to them might recede. Then, come July 2013, the $1.1 trillion European Stability Mechanism will spring to life. It will be backed by the 17 members of the eurozone, be policed by Brussels, and it will inherit the proto-IMF powers now being proposed for the European Financial Stability Facility that it will succeed. Well, that is the plan (at the time of writing), complete with a hint of Ponzi, a dash of Micawber, and dire warnings of what the alternative might be.

There’s a lot that needs not to go wrong, but of all the elements that could, the most dangerous may come from a source that Brussels has long tried to write out of the plot: the ballot box. There’s an irony to that. If there was anything (other than misplaced Carolingian nostalgia) at the heart of the project for a European union it was the idea that, after the wars of the first half of the twentieth century, the peoples of the old world could no longer be trusted with their own sovereignty. It’s never been much of an argument, but it’s worked well enough for the EU’s emerging technocratic elite.

The establishment of the euro is thus best understood as just another stage in the progressive disenfranchisement of Europe’s voters. The replacement of domestic currencies with what was, in effect, foreign money meant that, as a practical matter, the countries (and particularly the weaker countries) of the eurozone lost much of what was left of their fiscal and economic autonomy. Previously a nation with subpar finances and/or an uncompetitive cost base could allow the depreciation of its lira, its drachma, or its escudo to restore some balance. Its standard of living might fall relative to its international competitors’, but it could usually muddle along in the fashion that its people had, one way or another, chosen.

Now that option was closed. Forget the voters; once a country could no longer print its own money it had to run itself in ways that ensured it could keep international creditors—which is to say all creditors—happy. More generally, it had to manage itself in a manner that allowed it to keep reasonably close to the pacesetters of the monetary union in which it now dwelt—and if that country was Greece and the pacesetter was Germany, that was only going to be possible (if at all) with wrenching political and cultural change. That change might have been desirable, but to think that external discipline alone would be enough to set it in motion was a fatal conceit.

Please Europe, either put up or break up

By Ambrose Evans-Pritchard Economics Last updated: August 5th, 2011

So we wait to see whether the ECB is really willing to sit back and let the whole edifice collapse.

Are the Bundesbankers really so stubborn that they would rather bring down the European financial system, tank the world economy, and cause a deep global depression, rather than enter the bond market on a sufficient scale to back-stop Italy and Spain?

Tough call. 50:50, I’d say.

The hardliners are seriously ideological people, and there seem to be some in the upper echelons of German policy-making (though obviously not the floundering bean-counter Schauble, or the battered Chancellor), who suspect that it might be better to lance the boil by forcing an immediate break-up of EMU.

I note that Belgium’s central bank governor Coene hinted that the ECB is withholding bond purchases to force Italy and Spain to push through – you guessed it – yet more growth-destroying austerity. Dangerous game. These 1930s deflationists really are a menace to society.

In a nutshell, unless the ECB is willing to step in – I mean really step in, not piss in the wind – until such a time as the revamped EFSF bail-out is ratified by all parliaments and is ready to take the baton (say November), and unless the EFSF itself is quadrupled in size and given a €2 trillion mandate without all the German-imposed ifs and buts, then the game is up.

If the EU authorities refuse to do this, it is best for everybody that it is recognized immediately and that arrangements are made for the orderly break-up of monetary union… not next year, or next month, but next week.

It Just Went From Bad To Far, Far Worse As Germany Says Italy Is Too Big For EFSF To Save, Refuses To Carry Euro Bailout Burden

Dow Jones just hitting the tape referencing Spiegel
 SPIEGEL ONLINE - Nachrichten 

* German Govt: Italy Too Big For EFSF To Save - Spiegel
* German Govt: Doubts Whether Tripling EFSF Would Help It Save Italy
* German Govt: Italy Must Make Savings, Reforms To Exit Crisis - Spiegel
* Italy Debt Guarantee Could Raise Doubts Over Germany's Finances - Spiegel
* German Govt: EFSF Should Only Help Small, Mid-Size Countries - Spiegel

As a reminder, yesterday's stopgap announcement by the ECB to expand its SMP purchases of secondary market Italian and Spanish bonds was merely as a precursor to full EFSF monetization until its comes fully online in September (or sooner) in a vastly expanded format (between €1.5 and €3.5 trillion).

If Germany is now against this, which appears to be the case, it pretty much means, well, game over.

Add the uncerainty over the unwind of the Europe rescue "gamechanger" as one of the more naive CNBC anchors said yesterday, and Monday is now guaranteed to be a bloodbath.

As for those saying China will gladly step in and fund a $5 trillion EFSF shortfall, they may want to read the following article from Reuters:

Italian Economy Minister Giulio Tremonti said on Thursday that Asian investors are reluctant to buy Italian bonds because it sees they are not being bought by the European Central Bank.

Speaking at a news conference, Tremonti also said it would be desirable for the central bank to follow the lead of the Japanese and Swiss central banks in taking expansionary steps to tackly the euro zone's crisis.

"I note that the Bank of Japan today launched quantitative easing and the Swiss cen bank cut rates to zero, we are waiting for decisions if possible, but desirable (from the ECB)," Tremonti said.

An argument could be made that by agreeing to join the EU, the individual nations were giving up part their Sovereignty. Greece is a perfect example of this- they can't inflate away their problems. They have no national currency. They must use the Euro. They are screwed!

the euro was always a political tool, they told themselves it would add heft to the entire grp. it appears to me; that the entire euro franchise and whats become of the referendums, treaties etc. precludes popular participation. the 'people' are not quite ready to become one worlders, not is it really feasible unless you totally and absolutely break down every border and brain wipe nationality from the body.

Sluggish German GDP derails European stock rebound

PARIS, Aug 16 (Reuters) - European stocks fell on Tuesday, halting a rebound that started last week, as investors fretted about tepid German GDP growth ahead of talks between German and French leaders on the euro zone debt crisis.

At 0811 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 1.5 percent at 954.55 points.

Data showed German GDP growth slowed more than expected in the second quarter, dropping to 0.1 percent in seasonally adjusted terms from a revised 1.3 percent in the first three months of the year.

"This is a serious disappointment," West LB economist Joerg Lueschow said. "Many growth forecasts will now likely be lowered and we will do so too. This does not provide any positive signs for euro zone GDP. We cannot expect more than stagnation now."

With French data last week signalling a stagnated economy in the second quarter, the weak German figures suggested the 0.3 percent forecast for euro zone growth, due at 0900 GMT, could turn out to be too optimistic.

Fed Eyes European Banks
Regulators Scrutinize Ability of Institutions' U.S. Units to Fund Themselves

Federal and state regulators, signaling their growing worry that Europe's debt crisis could spill into the U.S. banking system, are intensifying their scrutiny of the U.S. arms of Europe's biggest banks, according to people familiar with the matter.

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which oversees the U.S. operations of many large European banks, recently has been holding extensive meetings with the lenders to gauge their vulnerability to escalating financial pressures. The Fed is demanding more information from the banks about whether they have reliable access to the funds needed to operate on a day-to-day basis in the U.S. and, in some cases, pushing the banks to overhaul their U.S. structures, the people familiar with the matter say.

Officials at the New York Fed "are very concerned" about European banks facing funding difficulties in the U.S., said a senior executive at a major European bank who has participated in the talks.

Regulators are seeking to avoid a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis, when the global financial system began to seize up. This time the worry is that the euro-zone debt crisis could eventually hinder the ability of European banks to fund loans and meet other financial obligations in the U.S. While signs of stress are bubbling up, the problems aren't yet approaching the severity of past crises.

A false rumour applying to one French bank. There are a number of European banks that are in danger of defaulting.

 
Eight out of 90 European banks have failed stress tests designed to ensure they can withstand another financial crisis.
The European Banking Authority (EBA), which carried out the healthcheck, said another 16 banks were in the danger zone.
The EBA called on national financial regulators to ensure that capital shortfalls would be quickly resolved.
Five Spanish banks failed, as well as one in Austria and two in Greece.
On Wednesday, Germany's Helaba pulled out of the stress tests, effectively making it the ninth bank to fail.

Was a French bank and an Italian. Was also an utter baseless lie by the Mail on Sunday and I hope they sue the shit out of the newspaper group for slander and liable.

As for the European stress tests... they have to be taken with a grain of salt so to say.

First off you have to look at the banks who failed the tests. All the Spanish banks were Caja's, and were already known suspects. Caja's are local saving banks and there are far far too many of them. There has been a consolodiation of these banks going on for the last 5 years. They are very small banks in the grand scale of things and frankly I have never understood why they were included considering their size. They account for around 3% or so of the Spanish banking market last I looked. And on top of that other local banks around Europe were not included... err okay. There are far more than 90 banks in Europe  

Secondly, you have to factor in the American banks and other international banks as well. The last time there was a stress test of American banks was several years ago and we already know now that those stress tests were not exactly impartial. For one Bank of America was and until very recently (if not still) pretty much insolvent. But BOA managed to dump 76 billion worth of toxic sub-prime mortgage backed securities on Fannie and Freddie and suddenly the problem with BOA is less.. but the US federal debt just grew with 76 billion. Funny how no one on the other side of the pond or in Europe dared talk about the problems BOA was in for years, but all of a sudden it is all the European banks that are a problem and being talked down including banks like very profitable and secure banks like HSBC and Barclays and Banco Santander. No one talks about American banks for some reason.... denial?

So this attack on European banks is mostly baseless and more than likely is a way to direct attention away from the real problem,... the US banking sector.

You do realize that over 139 banks have so far failed this year in the US right? It is 389 banks since the crisis started in 2007.

I say irrational driven panic based on constant talking down of economies and companies and rumours instead of facts. We are in a very evil cycle at the moment where people are talking down markets and causing the sell offs and panic pure based on rumour and "talking heads" being negative on pretty much everything.... negativity breeds negativity..

Average people in the US and Europe will stop spending because they hear daily how bad things are, which will only make things even worse and actually for-fill the dire negative comments of the pundits and experts, which in turn will lead to even more negative comments which will make people panic even more and make the economies even worse and worse. We need to break this cycle and re-establish a rational market again or else we will end in that depression certain pundits have been fearing since 2007... pundits I bet who have a lot of money invested in CDSs and are in line for a huge payout if countries and companies start falling like flies...
 
 
The stress tests were a joke.

Several big European banks are very undercapitalized and at risk. SocGen is one of them. So is Commerzbank. In fact, the German banks are in worse shape than the French banks. If this thing spreads to Germany, look out. The politicians are looking at Tier 1 capital and saying the banks are well capitalized. That's a joke. These banks have large off balance sheet liabilities. If you bring those liabilities back onto the balance sheet and mark them to market, the European banks are very weak.

The US banking system is not the problem. The US banking system raised hundreds of billions of dollars in capital and have written down nearly a trillion dollars in assets since the Financial Crisis began. The European banks never raised capital and have been playing "kick the can down the road" during the whole crisis. They are still marking their sovereign debt at par. They are keeping loans on their books way above their actual value. And they refuse to do anything about it. Europe is the problem, not America.

Off balance sheet liabilities.. like what?

Fact is regardless how pessimistic you are, the European banks have the backing of government. Say Commerzbank is an issue, but guess what... then it will be sold off to another bank or nationalised. It aint a major problem as you think it is. Much of this "panic" is based on false talking points, hype and rumour.

For example, earlier this week the talking heads on financial news started talking about the "supposed fear" that inter-banking lending could be a problem because of the "European debt crisis".. and guess what? As of last night it suddenly became a problem which it was not before these moronic talking heads started floating the idea. Even the freaking Swiss banks are in trouble.

 
The US banking system is not the problem. The US banking system raised hundreds of billions of dollars in capital and have written down nearly a trillion dollars in assets since the Financial Crisis began.
 
Yes it is.. just because the US banks had and have the ability to off load their shitty loans to government backed companies does not mean that the banking system is healthy. BOA just offloaded 76 billion in sub-prime crap to Fannie Mae. Guess who now has to deal with that bad debt? And if the US banks have "dealt" with their crappy loans, then why all of a sudden did BOA have to make a deal with Fannie Mae for 76 billion in loans? Was this not suppose to be dealt with years ago?

Also where did you get the 1 trillion number? The numbers I have seen on write downs of US sub-prime crap dont tally up to anywhere near 1 trillion. And ironically many of those write downs were done by European banks.... But it would be great if you could provide a link as I am very interested in where you got the number  

 
The European banks never raised capital and have been playing "kick the can down the road" during the whole crisis.
 
Not true. Our capital requirements according to the regulations have been met and are in many banks far higher than the requirements. Where there was need for capital, the banks did raise capital. You see in Europe we have banking regulations, and regulators that actually work. Some countries like Spain have quite harsh no-nonsense regulators which has meant that Europe is not burdened with the same "sub-prime" bad loans as the US was.... with the exception of Ireland of course.

Are there some banks that may be in trouble? Of course but as an over all banking system, the European is pretty okay as it stands now and has been through this whole crisis.

 
They are still marking their sovereign debt at par. They are keeping loans on their books way above their actual value. And they refuse to do anything about it.
 
Again not true. Most banks have been writing down Greek debt, Irish debt and other debt over the last few years. In fact Soc Gen rumours started when they said they were writing down their Greek debt load yet again. Google it... still cant post links.. 5 more posts to go..

 
Europe is the problem, not America.
 
It is a problem on both sides of the Atlantic. Only issue is one side is in total denial of their own financial system and think they dodged a bullet 3 years ago via TARP and so on. If you had not noticed, your housing problem has gotten worse and aint going away any time soon.

What is need is to stop blaming others while ignoring your own problems. I dont deny that Europeans need to fix their structural problems and sadly due to elections coming up in both Spain, Italy, France and Germany, that these changes wont happen any time soon. But like it or not, Europeans are use to "hard times" and never have been major spenders as it was. But as long as the US is in a political nightmare of the part of NO vs a wussy President then the problem will remain with the US since the US like it or not, is the engine of the world economy... Europe aint.. we just sell to the rest of the world. So the whole world is waiting for the US to fix its shit.
 
 
It's more than just rumours and fear mongering. The Fed opened up swap lines to the ECB way back in May and began instructing money market funds to cut bank on European bank paper last month. Eurodollar swap spreads widened out as did Eurolibor-OIS.

European banks are not well capitalized. They have not marked down their books far enough. Commerzbank wrote Greek bonds to zero but SocGen marked them down 20%. The Spanish banks in no way have marked their books to reflect the fall in housing prices in Spain.

America is not in great shape but it is better than in Europe. Loan loss provisions to delinquent loans are about half that in Europe as they are in America. The government force fed American banks capital-raises through TARP. Even though European banks have built capital through net interest margin, they have resisted issuing large amounts of shares as US banks did.

As I said, Europeans are saying that the banks are well capitalized. They are not. There was no correlation beween Tier 1 capital and solvency when the American banking system was insolvent a few years ago. Citigroup had Tier 1 capital of 8% just before it was bailed out.

Adjusting for off balance sheet liabilities and marking assets to market, equity capital is much lower than the accounts suggest. And though I fully expect the European governments to backstop any failures, don't be surprised if big European banks implode over the 24 months and get bailed out by their respective governments.

well, Der Fuhrer has spoken-

The recent resolutions transfer sizeable additional risks to the countries providing assistance and their taxpayers, and go a long way towards communitising risks caused by unsound public finances and misguided macroeconomic policies in individual euro-area countries. This weakens the foundations of monetary union, which is based on the principles of national fiscal responsibility and the disciplining effect of capital markets, without noticeably increasing the influence and control over individual national fiscal policies as a quid pro quo.

Overall, there is a risk that the originally agreed institutional framework of the monetary union will increasingly become eroded. While fiscal policy will continue to be determined by democratically elected parliaments at national level, the resultant risks and burdens will increasingly be borne by the Community in general and the financially sound countries in particular, without this being offset by any concrete powers to intervene in the sovereignty of national fiscal policies. No comprehensive change in the European treaties is currently envisaged that would democratically empower a central entity to exert some control over national budgetary policies. This means there is a danger that the euro-area countries’ propensity to incur debt may increase even further, and the euro area’s single monetary policy will be increasingly susceptible to the temptation to adopt an accommodating stance. Unless and until a fundamental change of regime occurs involving an extensive surrender of national fiscal sovereignty, it is imperative that the no bail-out rule that is still enshrined in the treaties and the associated disciplining function of the capital markets be strengthened, and not fatally weakened.

The IASB says that banks have not marked down their Greek debt enough. If so, they probably haven't marked down their other sovereign debt as well.

 
Some European financial institutions should have taken bigger losses on their Greek government bond holdings in recent results announcements, according to the body that sets their accounting rules.

In a letter sent to the European Securities and Markets Authority, the European Unions market regulator, the International Accounting Standards Board criticised the inconsistent way in which banks and insurers have been writing down the value of their Greek sovereign debt.

This is a matter of great concern to us, Hans Hoogervorst, IASB chairman, said in the letter, which was published on Tuesday after the IASBs concerns were revealed by the Financial Times.

People familiar with the IASBs thinking said the intervention was unprecedented and reflected its belief that some European companies had not been making enough provisions for Greek sovereign debt losses.

Financial institutions have slashed billions of euros from the value of their Greek government bond holdings following the countrys second bail-out. The extent to which Greek sovereign debt losses were acknowledged has varied, with some banks and insurers writing down their holdings by a half and others by only a fifth.

The letter did not single out particular countries or banks. But according to one person familiar with the correspondence, it reflected concern at the approach taken by BNP Paribas and CNP Assurances.

The French bank and insurer both announced 21 per cent writedowns, as envisaged by last months Greek bail-out. They argued there were no reliable market prices to guide a fair value for Greek government debt because of their illiquidity and instead used a mark to model valuation. Banks and insurers that used market prices suffered a bigger hit. Royal Bank of Scotland wiped £733m from the value of a £1.45bn Greek government bond portfolio  a 51 per cent cut.

Mr Hoogervorst challenged the justification for a mark to model approach and also the valuations these produced. Although the level of trading activity in Greek government bonds has decreased, transactions are still taking place, he said. It is hard to imagine that there are buyers willing to buy those bonds at the prices indicated... it is therefore difficult to justify that those models would meet the objective of a fair-value measurement.

Today was about Italy.

In some ways, it's fairly odd, given that Italy doesn't have a big deficit and has been reducing it's deficit over time. It didn't have a big bubble and it's banks aren't distressed, or at least not more so than other European banks. However, it was the third slowest growing economy in the world over the past decade, with only Zimbabwe and another country worse. It has negative productivity and a lot if debt.
 
It's NOT odd.

Look at the Celtic tiger.

They did everything right. Their national economic plan could have been written by the most conservative economic NEO-conservatives.

And STILL their economy tanked.

At some point in time we're going to have to acknowledge to ourselves that having people working is ALSO part of the formula for having a healthy economy.

Don't know when we're going to do that, though, as the mavens that control the Western economies surely don't give a fuck about their people.

and ahead of that, merkel is sinking fast, her party got pounded, if they the court plays games and punt, shes even in worse of a pickle because it will be up to her, and the public aint down with it. IF they rule the bailout illegal, oh boy. long term good short term, very very bad.
 
 
Given the electoral pounding the German government has been receiving no matter which way the court rules, she may face no confidence votes out of her own party.

If the court punts, there will be a new election and the SDU will win it.
 
 
and it appears they will not go along with the bailout. this was sooner or later going to happen, you can hide the facts from the rubes for only so long.
 
 
looks like the German courts decision has had little effect in that the their will have to be a major move by the g-7 before Monday's European open. how much firepower and influence do the central banks have left, seriously?
 
 
It's like a never-ending B movie.

But a bank or three have to go under before the German public will move.
 
 
we have gone beyond too big to fail to too big to rescue.

In boy scouts we had lifesaving class. First lesson is don't get too close to the person you are trying to rescue. They will drown you before going under themselves. You toss them ropes, and if they are cool enough, they will grab them. YOu toss them flotation devices, and the will grab them. But under no circumstances do you get where they can destroy you.

If they don't grab the rope, if they don't grab the ring, all you can do is fish the body out afterwards. The Greeks and the Italians have had multiple chances to fix the problem. They have tried to pull Germany and France in with them.

The best decision right now is just to wash their hands and let it all sort out the hard way. Recognize the previous spending was a sunk cost and invest no more into this rat hole.

exactly.....

and;

The head of the IMF has warned that its $384bn (£248bn) war chest designed as an emergency bail-out fund is inadequate to deliver the scale of the support required by troubled states.

In a document distributed to the IMF steering committee at the weekend, Ms Lagarde said: "The fund's credibility, and hence effectiveness, rests on its perceived capacity to cope with worst-casescenarios. Our lending capacity of almost $400bn looks comfortable today, but pales in comparison with the potential financing needs of vulnerable countries and crisis bystanders."

The suggestion came after European officials revealed they were working on a radical plan to boost their own bail-out fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), from 440bn (£384bn) to around 3 trillion.

The plan to increase the EFSF firepower is the crucial part of a three-pronged strategy being designed by German and French authorities to stop the eurozone's debt crisis spiralling out of control. It also includes a large-scale recapitalisation of European banks and a plan for an "orderly" Greek default.

That was a smart decision at the time, very dumb in retrospect. They wanted to get the ossies as close to western values as quickly as possible, but marking up the ostmark at.5 dmarks was way too high.

I was not aware that the Greeks and the Italians and Spaniards helped out the Germans at the time. I thought they financed that entirely internally.

According to Wiki, there is no way for the eurozone to sanction a state that fails to follow the rules once it is in, and Greece seems to have lied their way in, and now can't be removed.

Right now it looks like the Forint and Zloty are the healthiest currencies in europe. Given history, that is very funny.
 
 
well, let it be said, there is never a shortage of suckers, ever and they exist in every nation. The German people are screwed.

and whats funny is, the standards they have to come down from means they will feel the screwing before the heaps they are volunteering to rescue.

lets remember what this is for and driven by one thing at its crux; a lets all get along pile of Unicorn poppey.

I don't care how many pseudo or not academic/intellectual's ( who will shortly be divorcing themselves as usual from their wreckage) came out of the woodwork to prophecy the grand bargain of Pan- Europeanism expressed thru one set of voices and one currency come out of the wood work, Germans are Germans Brits are Brits and Greeks and Italians are Greeks and Italians.

They started breaking the rules set forth ala fiscal and financial strictures as laid down in the Maastricht treaty almost from the very start, in fact much of what they are doing now runs contrary to their charter. But like all such social engineering, they can never ever take a step back nor admit failure.

So they will pursue this right into the abyss. instead of letting Greece ( which they will anyway in Nov.) default and just let them out from the Euro and see how that works as a test case, they shut their eyes and just send in the D Marks oops, Deutsch Euros like the Grenadier Guard in a futile attmept to change the inevitable.

They will take the collection of the 400 or billion and use it as collateral for some form of other financial vehicles that will yield trillions, leveraging their finances forward for decades....and they will once again "La Garde a Feu" this time for Italy or Spain or?.......*shrugs*...and so it is and so it shall be, they won't stop till they run out of bodies.
 
 
The SPD is not happy with this, and neither is the German voter.

The SDU is going to crater in the next election like the Tories under John Major. Unless they stop this, the SDU may not make the 5% cut in order to get into the Bundestag.

merkel is at the head of that column of Grenadiers,.the old Potsdam Guard of old, the back benchers wanted to stay in the barracks but alas......she won't survive, but they bet they will...we'll see.
 
 
Eventually, some sort of transfer is going to get done. But there is likely to be a fair amount of pain first.

I'm looking to short the euro on any bounces.
 
 
Just as we discovered that our currency is only as strong as the weakest subprime loans we back. Europe is discovering that their currency is only as strong as their weakest country. This puts more nails in the coffin of any plans for a One World Currency. I just laugh at the IMF's SDRs.

Why Europe Dithers
German voters don't want to bail out French banks and the French government can't afford to.

* OCTOBER 21, 2011, 7:11 P.M. ET

'All political lives, unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture, end in failure." That morbid thought, voiced by a British politician named Enoch Powell in the 1970s, is now playing out in the careers of Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy. Neither leader has an incentive to sacrifice what have become vital and divergent interests to produce a credible bailout plan for Europe. To simplify, German voters don't want to bail out French banks, and the French government can't afford to bail out French banks, when and if the long-awaited Greek default is allowed to happen.

Thus Mr. Sarkozy's re-election hopes are going down the drain, but not as quickly as they would if he acceded to the Merkel plan to let each government rescue its own banks.

Ms. Merkel's hopes for a third term are being eroded in regional election after regional election, though not as quickly as they would if she agreed to put German taxpayers on the hook for France's troubled banking sector.

There is another savior in the wings, of course, the European Central Bank. But the ECB has no incentive to betray in advance its willingness to get France and Germany off the hook by printing money to keep Europe's heavily indebted governments afloat. Yet all know this is the outcome politicians are stalling for. This is the outcome markets are relying on, and why they haven't crashed.

All are waiting for some market ruction hairy enough that the central bank will cast aside every political and legal restraint in order to save the euro.

In doing so, of course, the bank will be acting far above its pay grade, and far outside the law, to make momentous decisions for all of Europe. Which countries will be saved via the bank's willingness to print unlimited euros and buy unlimited assets to keep them out of default?

Which countries will be allowed to default and (if they so choose) drop out of the euro altogether?

These choices the bank understands perfectly well it would be making in lieu of politicians who are unwilling to make such decisions, though not unwilling that such decisions be made. In their non-rescue of Greece last July, Europe's leaders proposed a 21% "voluntary" haircut to Greek debt held by banks, and now scuttlebutt has raised the politically acceptable haircut to 60%.

Though the central bank has been adamantly against a Greek default (because it owns a lot of Greek debt), this means it will surely read its mandate as permission to let Greece default.

The central bank has already stepped up, to wide applause, to keep Spain and Italy afloat when demand for their debt began to evaporate. Italy and Spain are "core" countries that the bank understands the politicians view as too big to fail. And France will likely get a temporary pass from the markets to run up its national debt in order to recapitalize its banks because, obviously, if the ECB won't let Italy and Spain sink, it won't let France sink.

That leaves Portugal and Ireland. Let's just guess that the ECB, aware of how far beyond the pale it has wandered, will act conservatively and prop them up too.

And then the crisis will be over? Not by a long shot.

We have been through sovereign debt crises before. Remember the whole mess in the early 80s about the South American Sovereign debt? It passed without a real blip.

The voters in France and Germany are going to hold the governments who plowed them into this mess accountable. We will see a whole new generation of politicians soon. Politicians who will get us into new messes. But not the same messes
 
 
 Interesting article from Germany on the current crisis. 

 
In October 2009, Marko Mršnik's analysts at rating agency Standard & Poor's computed that Greece's debt would increase to 125 percent of economic output in 2010. On the same day, it became more expensive to hedge Greek bonds against default. The default insurance instruments, known in market jargon as credit default swaps (CDS), were an indicator of how bad things stood for Greece. It was now costing $189,000 a year to hedge a $10-million Greek government bond against default. For major investors, it was a signal to get out of Greece.

A few people had also become nervous at the headquarters of the Pacific Investment Company (PIMCO) in Newport Beach, California, about an hour's drive south of Los Angeles.
PIMCO is by far the world's largest investor in government bonds. The company lends governments money by buying their bonds. When PIMCO stops buying a country's bonds, it's a clear sign that the country is on the verge of crisis and possibly even bankruptcy.

PIMCO controls more than $1.3 trillion (€1.05 trillion) on behalf of its customers. It is an absurd number, even in these times of superlatives, times of bailout funds and banks being supported with billions upon billions in taxpayer money. Though far from a household word, PIMCO has four times the German national budget to invest.

That's why almost all governments maintain close ties to PIMCO. They send their finance ministers, the heads of their central banks and sometimes even their national leaders to see CEO Mohamed El-Erian and convince him to buy their government bonds.

In the last few weeks of 2009, PIMCO sold all of its Greek bonds. El-Erian says the company wanted to get out before everyone else noticed that the numbers weren't adding up. The company never relies on outside assessments. Instead, it employs hordes of analysts, some of whom used to work at the International Monetary Fund, where El-Erian began his career.

The analysts spend all of their time digging through large quantities of data and the financial statements of nations, re-calculating, preparing projections and feeding numbers into computers. When they don't like what they see, PIMCO gets out.

When Greece was accepted into the euro zone, it was one more reason for PIMCO to buy Greek bonds. El-Erian says the sentiment at PIMCO was that if the Greeks were being granted membership in such an elite club, then Athens would follow the rules -- or the government would be severely sanctioned if it didn't. But that didn't happen. Instead, political concessions were made and the rules were ignored. That, El-Erian argues, is what brought the cancer into the euro zone.

So why didn't the financial markets penalize Greece earlier? Why was the same yardstick applied to Greek government bonds as to German bonds, until only a few years ago? Why did the markets continue to buy the country's bonds?

The Crash of Greek Bonds

On April 27, 2010, a country's debt was downgraded to junk status for the first time in the history of the young currency. Standard & Poor's downgraded Greece's bond rating by three notches, to BB+, putting it at the same level as Azerbaijan and Egypt, and just ahead of countries like Ecuador, El Salvador and Zimbabwe.

Mršnik wrote that Greece's government debt had to be "restructured" -- a fancy word for bankruptcy. Restructuring involves a debt haircut, so that owners of Greek bonds might only get 30 percent of their money back, that is, lenders are only repaid a fraction of the money they lent. The markets view a downgrade as the kiss of death. At this point, anyone who was still holding Greek bonds in his portfolio was crazy -- or a charitable donor.

But the market is neither crazy nor charitable. As soon as the downgrade was announced, Greek bonds were thrown onto the market, causing their prices to plunge. If the Greek government had introduced two-year bonds into the market at that point, it would have had to promise buyers a 13-percent interest rate, up from only 6.3 percent a few days earlier. The rate for 10-year bonds climbed to above 10 percent.

This came as a shock to many European banks. After the Lehman bankruptcy, they had invested heavily in the supposedly safer government bonds, with small yields that suggested security. But now it wasn't only Greek bonds that were seen as risky; confidence was also dwindling in Portugal, Ireland, Spain and even Italy.
Fear in Europe's Financial Capitals

Fear began to spread in places like Frankfurt and London. European banks had invested more than €700 billion in government bonds from the five crisis-stricken countries. And Greek banks alone were holding €50 billion in Greek government bonds. When the government bond rating was downgraded, so were the ratings of Greek banks, as part of a chain reaction that would not stop at Greece's borders.

yes we have, however, they had the assets to expend, room to either grow and deflate or just deflate. Now?

I have an analogy- They have tied themselves like mountain climbers all together in the Euro...2 members have slipped and other members take up the slack and when the bigger member's of the rope line slide ala spain and italy*shrugs*...they are barely holding on now....and you betcha there a great deal we don't know yet either. I bet its half again as worse as what they let on.

hey BM, this paragraph that you cut off due to copyright etc.....to bad, because this the payoff pitch.I read in the WSJ a few weeks ago they would create another 'fund' to which they would collect pledges etc. from all of the EU nations and whomever they can convince ( see: con) and issue bonds based on that, a fund full of promises......its going to unravel. It has to, how many times can you fool/con the same suckers, oops, I mean folks?  

 
Government bonds also serve as collateral when banks borrow money from the European Central Bank. The bonds are a key link in monetary transactions, and when their value becomes questionable, the supply of money to economies begins to falter.

well, as anyone other than those in the higher environs of the myriad EU Commissions' head up the ass club knew, the day has come.

Italy's bonds have moved across a pretty significant psychological and material boundary, + yields 7%.

Berlusconi and all the jazz not withstanding, Italy was always Lehman.....I think I have some lira from a trip way back in a box around here, I'll make a point of digging it out later  
 
 
1 yr Italys yielding 8.4% this am.
 
 
 
1 yr Italys yielding 8.4% this am.
 
I hear anything above 6.2% is unsustainable. Gold has been on a tear.

Europe is discovering that their currency is only as strong as their weakest / most corrupt country hiding off budget debt. This puts more nails in the coffin of any plans for a One World Currency. I just laugh at the World Bank / IMF's SDRs.

In a few years people around the globe will realize that only Gold can be used as a global reserve money.
 
 
doing some reading, and I found it beyond belief that Italy has not had one year with over 2% growth since......2000.

I have been there several times, twice in the last 5 years, they have an underground economy that rivals anyone's, any former eastern bloc country or Greece.
 
 
 
1 yr Italys yielding 8.4% this am.
 
ugh, and they are still planning to offer a 1 yer auction for 5 billion euros tomorrow? unreal.

Is the market in for another 3% drop?

lol
 
 
well, looks like the BJ's are humming and the Spanish have eaten their own 'Spanish fly' to get them up, yields on the Spanish 10 year rose above 6.9% yesterday.

and now? a monty python moment- for something completely crazy, as in insane as in the same actions with the expectation of different cooked results, we will have another round of bank stress tests.

first time, tragedy,...second time as farce.

Their 'Spanish fly' must be working. Looks like Merkel is getting cozy with Sarkozy

 
 
 
Yesterday, European bond yields reversed intra-day and closed on their lows or near their lows. At 6am this morning, they are down hard on ECB buying. Technically, it looks like yields may - may - have put in a near-term top, which would be good for risk assets.
 
 
some interesting not so surprising news.....we'll see how deep this river really runs next week.

The flight from European sovereign debt and banks has spanned the globe. European institutions like the Royal Bank of Scotland and pension funds in the Netherlands have been heavy sellers in recent days. And earlier this month, Kokusai Asset Management in Japan unloaded nearly $1 billion in Italian debt.

At the same time, American institutions are pulling back on loans to even the sturdiest banks in Europe. When a $300 million certificate of deposit held by Vanguard’s $114 billion Prime Money Market Fund from Rabobank in the Netherlands came due on Nov. 9, Vanguard decided to let the loan expire and move the money out of Europe. Rabobank enjoys a AAA-credit rating and is considered one of the strongest banks in the world.

American money market funds, long a key supplier of dollars to European banks through short-term loans, have also become nervous. Fund managers have cut their holdings of notes issued by euro zone banks by $261 billion from around its peak in May, a 54 percent drop, according to JPMorgan Chase research.

That's been happening for some time. It's why yields have been blowing out.
 
 
The problem with the Eurozone is simple - the Eurozone must find at least 3 trillion (give or take) to pay for the sovereign debt haircuts and bank losses. Some argue it is only 2 trillion and others argue for 6 trillion. Whatever it is, it is such a large number that it cannot be found by borrowing or creating a special fund. The ONLY way to deal with it is to allow the ECB to print, essentially putting a floor underneath Eurozone bonds, especially those of Italy and Spain, both of which governments are too big to save by conventional means.

But Merkel is saying NEIN!!!! She is against printing more EURO's because it will cause inflation and lower the value of the Euro, possibly a lot!

Germany is now stuck in a game where the costs of leaving the euro are extremely high. But the costs of bailing out the worst members of the Eurozone are also extremely high. Either way they are facing huge costs. It is not a choice of whether they will bear a huge cost burden, but just what form that burden takes.

Somewhere in Germany I will bet you there is a memo on what it would take for Germany to leave the euro and who would go with them. Just saying........

The odds of the EURO collapsing have risen to over 40%

The US Debt to GDP ratio surged past 100%. We are heading towards default within 6 years.

And those that argue 6 trillion are idiots.. the total debt of the EU is only 9 trillion for god sake out of a 15 trillion economy. The debt of the Eurozone is between 7 to 8 trillion euros.. So these morons are saying that the Eurozone should basically write off all their debt?

 
Whatever it is, it is such a large number that it cannot be found by borrowing or creating a special fund.

Wow sorry but you or someone you are quoting dont understand economics and the Germans. First off... Germany WANTS a lower value of the Euro... they are an export country and need a lower valued Euro.. it is one of the reasons that Germany cant and wont leave the Euro. But the real reason is a historic one.. Printing money is so much against the German economic model due to flash-backs to the hyper-inflation days of the 1920-30s.

 
Germany is now stuck in a game where the costs of leaving the euro are extremely high.
 
To say the least.. a new German currency would be so strong (since the UK pound and US Dollar are being devalued) that German exports will crash. That is of course on top of the administration costs of switching currency (not to mention time)..

 
But the costs of bailing out the worst members of the Eurozone are also extremely high.
 
Not really. This is not about bail-outs, because Spain for one does not need one.. nor Italy. This is about confidence in the Euro and Eurozone and structural issues for both the Eurozone and individual European countries. If Italy can get growth going via fixing its structural problems, then it can easily pay its debt. Spain's debt is 64% for god sake,.... how on earth is that a problem and need a bail-out? Does that mean that China needs one too since it has 30+% debt vs GDP?

 
Either way they are facing huge costs. It is not a choice of whether they will bear a huge cost burden, but just what form that burden takes.
 
Of course there are costs, and it wont be cheap. And those costs will continue to go up as long as the politicans cant get their act together.. basically Merkel needs to compromise on the whole idea of printing money. But most of all to fix the Eurozone, you will need a treaty change and that opens up a whole different can of worms.

 
Somewhere in Germany I will bet you there is a memo on what it would take for Germany to leave the euro and who would go with them. Just saying........
 
Of course there is, just as there is a memo on the US invading Canada and California ceding from the union. Dont mean it is going to happen. There are so many negatives for Germany and very few positives if any... for leaving the Euro.

Yes by Anglo-American owned ratings agencies who receive most of their income from companies that have a vested interest in a downgrade. Not to mention ratings agencies that have zero credibility since they listed Lehman Brothers as AAA the day before the bankruptcy.

 
The odds of the EURO collapsing have risen to over 40%
 
Yes, and one has to ask why...  

 
The US Debt to GDP ratio surged past 100%. We are heading towards default within 6 years.
 
Its been higher than 100% since late 2008. As for heading for a "default", not bloody likely as long as the US dollar is the reserve currency. Also the interest rate the US pays on its debt is pathetically small and much of the debt is long term.
 
 
 
Yes by Anglo-American owned ratings agencies who receive most of their income from companies that have a vested interest in a downgrade.
 
This is not a serious answer.

Spain is a problem because the marks on the banks' assets are nowhere near market prices. Bond markets are assuming that Spain will eventually have to backstop its banks and Spain's debt will soar.

China doesn't need a bailout but when you aggregate debt at the municipal and provincial level, then debt is much higher since a lot of debt in China is at the local level. Also, it is widely assumed that Beijing will recapitalize the banks, like it did in the 1990s, which will either increase debt or cause assets to fall since Beijing may unwind some of its massive currency reserves to do so. Plus, unlike the PIIGS, China has its own currency.

  But of course, and Greece did not just default on 50% of it's debt.  

  And Mexico did not default on it's debts 15 years ago.  

  How about the Asian Contagion 12 years back?  
 
 
 
 
Yes by Anglo-American owned ratings agencies who receive most of their income from companies that have a vested interest in a downgrade.
 
This is not a serious answer.
 
It is a VERY serious answer. The problem with the ratings agencies other than two countries basically control them, is that they get their income from the very companies that dependent on ratings to run their business.. There is a built in conflict of interest in the system and it has shown its ugly head more than once, as has national bias.. hence the anglo-American comment.

Any other country with 10% budget deficit and debt ratios over 70% and if not 100%, would have their ratings on at least a downward watch if not downgraded, but that simply is not happening with the UK (still AAA) and it took one hell of a while for the US to be downgraded (and only by one rating agency) despite having a clusterfuck of a political system that cant get anything done.
 
 
 
 
Spain's debt is 64% for god sake,.... how on earth is that a problem and need a bail-out? Does that mean that China needs one too since it has 30+% debt vs GDP?
 
Spain is a problem because the marks on the banks' assets are nowhere near market prices. Bond markets are assuming that Spain will eventually have to backstop its banks and Spain's debt will soar.
 
The Spanish banks (the big main ones) have always been considered some of the best and most stable banks out there. They did not jump into the sub-prime mortgage mess of the US because they were not allowed due to regulations and the corporate ideals, which also meant they continued to have profits (and still do) despite the economic crisis.

The problem banks in Spain are the Caja's, which are small regional and local banks. There use to be about 75 of them but they have now been cut down considerably to the high 20s (if not lower) and there is still consolidation going on. They account for about 3% of the total banking market in Spain last I looked. Back stopping these banks would cost relatively nothing and only add a few % to the over all debt vs GDP ratio. The main big banks have the ability to absorb any losses on the building sector collapse and have done so over the last 4+ years and passed the capital requirements of the stress tests with flying colours and have since increased their capital requirements because the Bank of Spain required it so.

So explain your comment.

 
China doesn't need a bailout but when you aggregate debt at the municipal and provincial level, then debt is much higher since a lot of debt in China is at the local level.
 
Never said it did. Having debt does not mean automatically you need a bail-out, but that is the attitude there is in the markets and among especially the kitchen table right wing economists that are dominating the political discourse in the US and certain countries and have infected the market with this idiotic economic theory that all debt is bad.

For example.. Italy.. 120% debt vs GDP.. world goes in panic mode and says it is too much and Italy cant pay its loans. What the world forgets is that Italy has a primary surplus already, and that we never have gotten out of the US sub-prime mortgage failure, so there is next to no growth. If growth came back then that would mean higher tax income and that would mean a surplus... then the 120% debt would not be a problem and would go down. Now of course Italy has a lot of structural problems in the labour market and society as a whole that prevents mega uber growth the markets like but if they fix those some what, then growth should come back under normal circumstances. And lets not forget, a very large portion of Italian debt is owed to the Italians themselves!

But no everyone is living in the now, and are very short term focused... and of course very pessimistic and unrealistic...which means morons come with comments of cutting 6 trillion euros worth of debt out of a 7.5 trillion debt burden in the Eurozone.. fine do so.. would mean most countries would have NO DEBT left!

 
Also, it is widely assumed that Beijing will recapitalize the banks, like it did in the 1990s, which will either increase debt or cause assets to fall since Beijing may unwind some of its massive currency reserves to do so. Plus, unlike the PIIGS, China has its own currency.
 
PIIGS have their own currency as well.. it is just not as flexible as it should be because of the Germany hatred to printing money. Now if the Eurozone could get its act together and fix its structural problems in the Euro then do you expect the markets to say okay? I doubt that... the Eurozone is a good place to keep focus away form the real clusterfucks of the US and UK and use as a blame game when the whole house of cards come collapsing in the US.

Personally I hope Merkel and the Germans get over their hatred of printing money.. because we need to print money to counteract the devaluation of the pound and dollar, but also use that money to be able to fix the structural problems in the south of Europe.

Greece has not defaulted. CDSs have not be triggered (yet) so there is no default.

 
  And Mexico did not default on it's debts 15 years ago.  
 
Technically Mexico did not default as far as I understand it. The US bailed Mexico out and once Mexico got its act together, the US made a profit on its investment.

 
  How about the Asian Contagion 12 years back?  
 
Yea.. that was  
 
 
 
Greece has not defaulted. CDSs have not be triggered (yet) so there is no default.
 
  Yeah right, tell that to MF Global.   A write-down is a default!  

 
Technically Mexico did not default as far as I understand it. The US bailed Mexico out and once Mexico got its act together, the US made a profit on its investment.
 
Yeah, the US made some money on the Mexicans, But they lost half of the value of their Peso currency in the process.

They did not jump into the sub-prime mortgage mess of the US because they were not allowed due to regulations and the corporate ideals, which also meant they continued to have profits (and still do) despite the economic crisis.
 
The problem with Spanish banks is Spain. The Spanish banks look more profitable than they really are because they have not marked the value of their loans to market. Spanish banks made loans against this.

 

And now, they have this.

 
Spanish banks, under pressure to cut property-backed debt, hold about 30 billion euros ($41 billion) of real estate thats unsellable, according to a risk adviser to Banco Santander SA (SAN) and five other lenders.

Im really worried about the small- and medium-sized banks whose business is 100 percent in Spain and based on real- estate growth, Pablo Cantos, managing partner of Madrid-based MaC Group, said in an interview. I foresee Spain will be left with just four large banks.

Spanish lenders hold 308 billion euros of real estate loans, about half of which are troubled, according to the Bank of Spain. The central bank tightened rules last year to force lenders to aside more reserves against property taken onto their books in exchange for unpaid debts, pressing them to sell assets rather than wait for the market to recover from a four- year decline.

Land in the middle of nowhere and unfinished residential units will take as long as 40 years to sell, Cantos said. Only bigger banks such as Santander, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA), La Caixa and Bankia SA are strong enough to survive their real-estate losses, he said. MaC Group is an adviser on company strategy focused on financial services.

Soaring yields and CDS for Spain isn't some lame Anglo-American right-wing plot. The market simply believes Spain has taken on too much debt. Spain had an even bigger housing bubble than the US, relatively speaking. And no, the problem is not just the cajas.

You are in for a rude shock.

 
For example.. Italy.. 120% debt vs GDP.. world goes in panic mode and says it is too much and Italy cant pay its loans. What the world forgets is that Italy has a primary surplus already, and that we never have gotten out of the US sub-prime mortgage failure, so there is next to no growth. If growth came back then that would mean higher tax income and that would mean a surplus... then the 120% debt would not be a problem and would go down. Now of course Italy has a lot of structural problems in the labour market and society as a whole that prevents mega uber growth the markets like but if they fix those some what, then growth should come back under normal circumstances. And lets not forget, a very large portion of Italian debt is owed to the Italians themselves!
 
As you can see, Italy's debt has been above 100% of GDP forever.

 

Rising yields on Italian debt isn't the fault of the collapse of the US subprime market, nor the fault of "right-wing economists." It is the fault of the Italians. The fact that it is happening now is no surprise. When there is a liquidity crisis, the weaker hands get shaken out first. It doesn't matter if the debt is owned by Italians anyways, not when monetary policy is being run out of Frankfurt and Berlin.

 
PIIGS have their own currency as well.. it is just not as flexible as it should be because of the Germany hatred to printing money. Now if the Eurozone could get its act together and fix its structural problems in the Euro then do you expect the markets to say okay? I doubt that... the Eurozone is a good place to keep focus away form the real clusterfucks of the US and UK and use as a blame game when the whole house of cards come collapsing in the US.
 
Spain is a house of cards. Europe's banks are weak and undercapitalized compared to the US and much of the rest of the world. Blaming it on the British and Americans is really lame, like an alcoholic blaming everyone else for his problems. You Europeans wanted a German currency with German interest rates. You wanted low interest rates and cheap credit, and all the benefits that came with that. You got it. Now you have to live with the aftermath. I imagine Germany will cave eventually, but not before you feel some pain first.
 
 
 
 
 
Yes by Anglo-American owned ratings agencies who receive most of their income from companies that have a vested interest in a downgrade.
 
This is not a serious answer.
 
It is a VERY serious answer. The problem with the ratings agencies other than two countries basically control them, is that they get their income from the very companies that dependent on ratings to run their business.. There is a built in conflict of interest in the system and it has shown its ugly head more than once, as has national bias.. hence the anglo-American comment.

Any other country with 10% budget deficit and debt ratios over 70% and if not 100%, would have their ratings on at least a downward watch if not downgraded, but that simply is not happening with the UK (still AAA) and it took one hell of a while for the US to be downgraded (and only by one rating agency) despite having a clusterfuck of a political system that cant get anything done.
 
You said they are run by companies that have a vested interest in downgrading the debt of the countries. That is not a serious answer. You did not address that in your post.

And you should be more worried about the clusterfuck going on in Europe and the laughable inability of its institutions to get anything done first before whining about what is going on elsewhere. Europe is the fulcrum of the globe's problems right now, not America.
 
 
I'm looking at our banking data, which includes two big Spanish banks, BBVA and Banco Santander. We normalize accounting around the world and mark to market the assets on the balance sheets. We then bring on all off balance sheet items and aggregated them into total assets. We have done this for over 100 global banks. As of the end of Q2, Santander is one of the weakest banks in the world, with tangible common equity to fair value assets at 2%. BBVA is better but is still weak at about 4%. And remember, this was at the end of June, before the markets collapsed during the summer. Perhaps ironically, the country with the weakest banking system is Germany, which is another reason why Germany will eventually cave and start printing money.

This methodology had Dexia - which passed the laughable European stress tests - as the weakest bank with negative equity. It was also a very good indicator at predicting which banks were in trouble in 2008. FTR there was no correlation between Tier 1 capital and individual bank stress in 08 & 09.
 
 
 
Personally I hope Merkel and the Germans get over their hatred of printing money.. because we need to print money to counteract the devaluation of the pound and dollar, but also use that money to be able to fix the structural problems in the south of Europe.
 
There's only 1 way forward:
The other -countries have to downsize: Wages down, down with government spending and down with social benefit-payments. And you are back with a happy and healthy economy.
Cutting spending is not nice, but there is not another way to handle the situation. Germany has already gone through this process and still Germany itself doesn't.meet some parts of Maastricht criterias.

The Euro-Zone partners want Germany's money and German commitment to liability for other's debts. They want Germany to pay for Europe exceeding what it already pays through the cohesion policy to the underdeveloped regions surrounding it.

Just as it was planned in Versailles.
 
 
Spain 10 year government bond yield.

 
 
 
Institutions are pulling their deposits out of Italian and Spanish banks.

 
Euro-zone leaders say they are determined to save the single currency. But the smart money is voting with its feet. First, short-term U.S. dollar-funding markets effectively closed, then the senior unsecured-bond markets shut down, then the interbank market. Now, corporate customers appear to be withdrawing their deposits from some countries' banks. With an estimated 1.7 trillion ($2.29 trillion) of funding to roll over in the next three years, the stresses in the euro-zone banking system look doomed to get worse.

In some cases, the drop in corporate deposits has been startling. In Italy, nonretail customers withdrew 56 billion in the three months to the end of September, a fall of 12%. Intesa Sanpaolo and UniCredit saw corporate deposits decline by 16% and 10%, respectively, according to Citigroup research. Similarly, in Spain, nonretail deposits fell by 20% in the third quarter, with Santander and BBVA losing 10% and 11%, respectively. Even the French banks weren't immune: Société Générale and BNP Paribas saw their corporate-deposit balances fall by 7% and 6%, respectively.

You are in for a rude shock.
 
You do realize that you proved my point right? "Only the bigger banks... are strong enough to survive".. it is in your quote. And since it is the bigger banks who hold most of the "bad housing debt", then what exactly is the problem? It is not like Spain is trying to ignore or hide the building bubble it went trough... and yes it was worse than the US, but unlike the US, in Spain the average Spaniard did not participate as much in the boom as the average American. Most of the buying was done by expats, which drove up prices.

And look at the numbers... 308 billion in real estate loans and half are in trouble. So that is 154 billion the Spanish state might have to take over adding to their over all debt.

Okay... what will that do to the debt ratio? Well the Spanish economy is about 1 trillion Euros, and has a debt ratio of 64%, which means 640ish billion in debt... so the debt ratio will go from 64% to 80%... the same as Germany btw.... and that is if the Spanish government takes over ALL the bad debt.. which is unrealistic...

So come again on how that is a problem?

LOL seriously? First you correctly state that Italy has had high debt ratio since "forever", and then you say it is not surprising that it is happening now.. what the hell? If debt was such a serious issue as it is claimed to be now, then why was it not such a serious issue 20 years ago? And yes it is right wing policies, Italy has been under right wing control for over a decade.

Hog wash. Bank of America has be insolvent for a very long time, and yet nothing has been done about it. CITI is not much better. But unlike the European banks, who have the bear their losses, American banks can push their crap loans onto the US federal government via Fannie and Freddie Mac. Funny how Bank of American managed to get rid of 86 billion of toxic mortgages to Fannie Mae for 500 million dollars.. And how many banks has the US feds taken over since the crisis... several hundred...

And ignoring the facts of who caused this fucking mess we all are in is lame. Americans and the Brits are running form responsibility in starting the economic crisis we all are in now. Yes Europe had its problems and thanks to the Anglo-American "dream" of cheap credit and sub-prime, then Europe was able to ignore the problem.. now with the crash thanks to the American sub-prime market scandal, then Europe is forced to deal with it, and that is all fine and dandy.. but dont come here and claim some sort of economic saint-hood when it is the US and UK that in large parts are responsible for the economic melt down we are all in now.

While Europe has its problems and I dont deny it, and we have our political problems... it is nothing compared to the clusterfuck going on in the US. Not only are there no plans to fix the budget, but everyone is carrying along like nothing is wrong and blaming each other for the ills of the country (when not blaming the Europeans). At least in Europe we are dealing with our deficits and structural problems.... it might take time, but it is happening.

It is a problem for the same reason why it is a problem in Italy and Greece - the Spanish economy is not productive enough to grow at a fast enough rate to outgrow its debt.

The fact that Spain's debt would "only" be 80% of GDP isn't particularly relevant. There is no magical threshold that a nation crosses when it suddenly becomes a problem. Countries have defaulted when debt to GDP was 60%. At other times, countries have not defaulted until debt has reached 130%. Reinhardt and Rogoff have estimated that on average, a nation becomes vulnerable when debt hits 90%, but default can occur at much lower or much higher levels. Japan is much higher and they have not defaulted. It depends on the vagaries of the market. And when the market stresses, the first to go are the weakest. Spain is highly-indebted weak economy that uses a German currency. That is a bad recipe.

 
LOL seriously? First you correctly state that Italy has had high debt ratio since "forever", and then you say it is not surprising that it is happening now.. what the hell? If debt was such a serious issue as it is claimed to be now, then why was it not such a serious issue 20 years ago? And yes it is right wing policies, Italy has been under right wing control for over a decade.
 
Left-wingers whine about the market and don't understand it. It wasn't an issue for the past 20 years because the market did not perceive it to be an issue. It's not surprising that it is happening now because the market is figuring out the illogic of the eurozone as constructed. It didn't matter when debts were lower and growth was higher. It is happening now because the market has decided to make it an issue now.

In times of stress, the first to get cut off from the capital markets are the weakest credits. We are in a time of stress because European banks have too little equity and European countries have too much debt and not enough growth. When things are good, the cracks can be papered over. When things turn bad, those cracks get exposed. Overlay that with the internal illogic of the eurozone and you have a sovereign debt crisis.

The euro as designed was destined to fail. The math and logic of it - despite the protestations of dreamy-eyed idealists - does not work. It is fundamentally flawed economically. It can work if the more productive north decides to subsidize the less productive south forever, or if the south becomes as productive as the north (and that's not going to happen). So if the German, Dutch and Finnish taxpayer wants to send their money south forever, or if the Spanish, Italians and Greeks want to be as productive as the north, then the euro experiment can work. Otherwise, it will fail as is. And it is failing now.

 
Hog wash. Bank of America has be insolvent for a very long time, and yet nothing has been done about it. CITI is not much better.

BofA is undercapitalized, but the American banks - including BofA - have raised hundreds of billions of dollars in equity and have removed hundreds of billions of dollars of bad assets off their books. They are far, far better off than the European banks today. This is not seriously debated by anyone.

The European banks, for the most part, denied there was a problem, and resisted raising equity. Now, they are woefully undercapitalized. Dexia is done. The Landesbanks in Germany are essentially insolvent. The Spanish banks are bouyed by their Latin American assets but have their heads in the sand regarding their domestic market. The Greek banks will be on life support. And Italian banks are dumping their Italian bonds.

European banks have been playing Pretend for some time now. They have refused to shop their pools of assets because it would have required them taking marks on the loan books, which would have demonstrated they are woefully undercapitalized. So they pretended there wasn't a problem. Now the market is forcing them to dump their assets and shrink their balance sheets, and the banks hoping to buy enough time to find a solution. They have to because they are shopping their best assets. The best assets will get sold and the shittiest assets will get dumped on to the balance sheets of the states.

 
And ignoring the facts of who caused this fucking mess we all are in is lame. Americans and the Brits are running form responsibility in starting the economic crisis we all are in now. Yes Europe had its problems and thanks to the Anglo-American "dream" of cheap credit and sub-prime, then Europe was able to ignore the problem.. now with the crash thanks to the American sub-prime market scandal, then Europe is forced to deal with it, and that is all fine and dandy.. but dont come here and claim some sort of economic saint-hood when it is the US and UK that in large parts are responsible for the economic melt down we are all in now.
 
I'm not the one claiming sainthood. But we've gone through the fire, we've taken our medicine, and we aren't blaming anyone else. You're the one blaming your problems on others, brushing Europe's internal problems aside as if they are easily solvable - "Oh, Italy will be fine once it liberalizes its labour markets." Yeah, good luck with that. Your banks are woefully undercapitalized and they resist doing anything about it. Don't blame others if you got sold. You sucked up the easy credit. You bought the store. That's on you.

 
While Europe has its problems and I dont deny it, and we have our political problems... it is nothing compared to the clusterfuck going on in the US.

Yeah, right. Get back to us when the IMF is involved in bailing out America like it is in Europe.

Thanks for your input boys.

BTW

Yesterday, Belgian 10 year bonds fell $3. (Par is $100.) That is an enormous move in the bond market. It had fallen $5 in two days.
 
 
Belgium is the next in line. This is the price of 10 year government bonds issued by the Kingdom of Belgium. It is falling off a cliff.

 
 
 
 
 
The problem with the Eurozone is simple - the Eurozone must find at least €3 trillion (give or take) to pay for the sovereign debt “haircuts” and bank losses. Some argue it is only €2 trillion and others argue for €6 trillion.
 
And those that argue 6 trillion are idiots.. the total debt of the EU is only 9 trillion for god sake out of a 15 trillion economy. The debt of the Eurozone is between 7 to 8 trillion euros.. So these morons are saying that the Eurozone should basically write off all their debt?

 
Whatever it is, it is such a large number that it cannot be found by borrowing or creating a special fund. The ONLY way to deal with it is to allow the ECB to print, essentially putting a floor underneath Eurozone bonds, especially those of Italy and Spain, both of which governments are too big to save by conventional means.

But Merkel is saying NEIN!!!! She is against printing more EURO's because it will cause inflation and lower the value of the Euro, possibly a lot!
 
Wow sorry but you or someone you are quoting dont understand economics and the Germans. First off... Germany WANTS a lower value of the Euro... they are an export country and need a lower valued Euro.. it is one of the reasons that Germany cant and wont leave the Euro. But the real reason is a historic one.. Printing money is so much against the German economic model due to flash-backs to the hyper-inflation days of the 1920-30s.

To say the least.. a new German currency would be so strong (since the UK pound and US Dollar are being devalued) that German exports will crash. That is of course on top of the administration costs of switching currency (not to mention time)..

Not really. This is not about bail-outs, because Spain for one does not need one.. nor Italy. This is about confidence in the Euro and Eurozone and structural issues for both the Eurozone and individual European countries. If Italy can get growth going via fixing its structural problems, then it can easily pay its debt. Spain's debt is 64% for god sake,.... how on earth is that a problem and need a bail-out? Does that mean that China needs one too since it has 30+% debt vs GDP?

 
Either way they are facing huge costs. It is not a choice of whether they will bear a huge cost burden, but just what form that burden takes.
 
Of course there are costs, and it wont be cheap. And those costs will continue to go up as long as the politicans cant get their act together.. basically Merkel needs to compromise on the whole idea of printing money. But most of all to fix the Eurozone, you will need a treaty change and that opens up a whole different can of worms.

 
Somewhere in Germany I will bet you there is a memo on what it would take for Germany to leave the euro and who would go with them. Just saying........
 
Of course there is, just as there is a memo on the US invading Canada and California ceding from the union. Dont mean it is going to happen. There are so many negatives for Germany and very few positives if any... for leaving the Euro.
 

 
Not really. This is not about bail-outs, because Spain for one does not need one.. nor Italy. This is about confidence in the Euro and Eurozone and structural issues for both the Eurozone and individual European countries.
 
the driving force that created the euro wasn't a financial/fiduciary one per se', it was created as political device, that is why it is doomed to fail.

so, in effect it appears that you wish the ECB to become just another 'nation-state' that prints money to pay its bills in the short term?Because they won't grow their way out of this, minus, huge, and I mean huge structural changes.

Until Greeks stop being Greeks and Italians Italians etc etc. the issue will only be kicked down the road, printing presses won't save you and I have my doubts as to Greece et al all of sudden taking orders for what will amount to a lower standard of living from what they perceive as The EU, ala Germany, France etc., not that they aren't going to have one anyway, but its one thing to stumble into it on your own and wholly in another to have one dictated to you.
 
 
 
Belgium is the next in line. This is the price of 10 year government bonds issued by the Kingdom of Belgium. It is falling off a cliff.

 
 
I have not checked the news in the last 24....wow.

I'd like to point out as part of the theatre of the absurd that has been allowed to fester there, Dexia was 'stressed tested in June and pronounced- healthy, with maybe 5 billion as the HIGHEST level of euro sppt. necessary if push came to shove. We saw how that worked out.

As you can see, Italy's debt has been above 100% of GDP forever.

 
 
yes BUT, they have not had GDP north of 2% since,....drumroll please, 2000. It comes home to roost sooner, or later.  

this imho just buttresses your other point though, that they cannot grow their way out.
 
 
 
 
There's only 1 way forward:
The other -countries have to downsize: Wages down, down with government spending and down with social benefit-payments. And you are back with a happy and healthy economy.

Just as it was planned in Versailles.
 
So your solution is to make people poorer? Does that include the rich and bankers? or is it just the lower and middle classes?
 
Real wages are stagnant in Germany for 10 years. There were painful reforms.
There's no reason why Germany should pay for other people's living standards.
Germans are biggest contributors to EU's funds, and are biggest shareholders of ECB which already is in debt to German CB more than 330 Billion  because Trichet (former French president of ECB) started to buy up the Siesta-Bonds from the South to save the French Banks.

If they want more, they'll all have to play by Germany's rules: Austerity.
It's simple as that.
 
 
 
The euro as designed was destined to fail. The math and logic of it - despite the protestations of dreamy-eyed idealists - does not work. It is fundamentally flawed economically.
 
The  itself isn't "flawed economically", the problem is, that there is no institution and measures to punish the member-states who violate the Maastricht criterion (no more than 3% of GDP deficit, no more than 60% debt of GDP).
Once member-states are forced into complying to the criterion everything will be fine.
That's why Germany wants the contracts changed to introduce punitive measures.

Not true.

It is true that the Maastricht Treaty has been shredded by the likes of France and Germany, but that's not the fundamental problem. The fundamental problem is that there is no mechanism to counter-balance economic pressures within the eurozone.

For a currency union to work, when one region is economically depressed and another reason is booming, there must be some transfer between regions. In a well-functioning currency union, labour would flow freely from the depressed region to the booming region, and/or money flowing from the booming region to the depressed region.

The EU has a free market in labour but in practice, there are significant cultural barriers to the mass movement of labour from one region to another. A third of Greece is not going to move to Germany for example. And apart from the CAP and some infrastructure spending, there isn't much in the way of transfers from the rich to the poor areas, at least not in the scale required. Social programs that could alleviate the depressed region are funded mainly by national governments, not from Brussels, when what is needed is for the Germans to fund the Spanish unemployed.

This is why the eurozone was destined to fail. Economically weak regions need to be subsidized by the strong areas. Or the economically weak areas have to become more productive and efficient. The problem is thus a political one, not an economic one. But you have to either convince the northern countries to subsidize the southern countries forever, or the southern countries have to become more like the north, which is highly unlikely.
 
 
 
Not true.

It is true that the Maastricht Treaty has been shredded by the likes of France and Germany, but that's not the fundamental problem. The fundamental problem is that there is no mechanism to counter-balance economic pressures within the eurozone.

For a currency union to work, when one region is economically depressed and another reason is booming, there must be some transfer between regions. In a well-functioning currency union, labour would flow freely from the depressed region to the booming region, and/or money flowing from the booming region to the depressed region.

German economy has been 2nd biggest capital exporter in world since 1990's after China. Only 24% of what has been generated in Germany has been reinvested in Germany. The rest went to foreign countries, also to the southern EU countries. Germany had the 2nd lowest growth within the EU since 90's and between 1998-2005 wages in Germany decreased in relation to the EU by 18%. The wages didn't really decrease but the wages elsewhere in EU skyrocketed.

That's what has to happen or they'll have to leave -zone once the crisis doesn't represent anymore a fundamental threat. There can not be always chieftains, but there also have to be normal Indians. Like in USA where there are states who do well and states who do not so well.

At some point the crisis will be defused by introducing a form of Eurobond-light where Germany will give guarantees for other' country's debts, but only after Germany's demands are met and political weight of EU has been relocated from Brussels to Berlin, like it always should've been.
Can not be, that an EU Commission President who himself contributed to Portugal's debt-crisis when he was that country's Prime Minister tells Germany what to do and demands unconditional guarantees and cash-flow.

At the end of the crisis the EU's political system will resemble the EU's economic structure, where Germany is the heavyweight.
The USA also isn't making a currency-zone with S.America and gives Trinidad and Tobago the same political weight within that currency-zone and freedom to do as it wishes with the debt-situation.

So you shouldn't declare the  dead. It isn't and won't die.
Germany has no intention to depart or let the  fall. The crisis also profits indirectly Germany as money re-enters Germany and there are elections in 2013.
Germany has them all by the balls, and they now have a little time to adapt to the reality and then situation will move on and crisis will be defused.

60 billion a year isn't enough to mitigate the pressure in the south.

Germany an exporter of capital is what one would expect from a country that runs a trade surplus with its partners. Half of Germany's exports go to the rest of Europe, which is no surprise because Germany is more productive than the south. When countries use the same currency, the relative price of the more productive country falls and the relative price of the less productive country rises. This is the fundamental problem with the eurozone. The more productive economy is more competitive and the less productive economy is less competitive. Thus, the productive north sells more than the unproductive south. To alleviate the pressures in the south, either capital has to come in or labour has to go out.

Equity capital flows are not a problem - the investor takes the loss if it goes sour. Debt isn't a problem either if the lender is willing to take a haircut on their debt. But the Germans and French banks don't want to take the requisite haircuts because they risk insolvency. They want their money back. Well, that's not going to happen. Banks have already started to take haircuts on Greek bonds and eventually will on lending to Italy and Spain.

Capital came into the south primarily through lending. German banks had excess capital deposited by German companies making lots of money selling to their European neighbors. German banks then lent it outside of Germany because their home market is stagnant - the population isn't growing and consumption is relatively weak. Much of that money went into funding a speculative boom in Spanish real estate. For a time, more homes were built in Spain than were built in France and Germany combined, which is nuts given that Spain has a population a third that of the two. But, like housing bubbles around the world, it went bust, and the banks are holding a lot of bad loans they don't want to recognize.

This situation is untenable. For a currency union to work, there must be sufficient funds transferred into the depressed region, or a sufficient amount of labour must leave. Even if all the debt is wiped out, the fundamental problem is not solved because it will happen again (unless German and French banks want to continuously underwrite bad loans to the south).

The euro will not survive as is. I believe it will survive in some form but either members will leave or there will be a tighter political union. The problem goes away if there is a tighter political union that facilitates the flow of capital from the north to the south. But it is hard to see that happening.

what is the point you are trying to make?
 
 
I'm reading this piece with data from ECB on banks. In the US, the loan to deposit ratio is 73%. In the eurozone, it is 108%. Deposits as a percentage of bank financing in the eurozone is 54%. It is 76% in the US. The ratio in the US has fallen by 20 points since the financial crisis. This is because the US banks have deleveraged and decreased their reliance on wholesale financing, i.e. the capital and interbank markets.

what is the point you are trying to make?
 

The  is under stress. The reason is the debt-situation of the -countries and disproportional spending (debt) in relation to actual economic situation.
I asked what justifies this kind of real wage increases in those countries with such kind of problems without any significant performance either in productivity or exports. And as counter example I showed the situation in Germany, the country which is ultimately to save the .

Germans have stagnant real wages, and had painful reforms. Yet, they didn't go onto streets and demonstrated like the crisis-countries now do who take it as granted to be bailed out and who are not really willing to go the way of austerity,. but are expecting for German bailout.

I think my points are relevant, so what's the point you're trying to make ?

my point is this was all preordained, due to the political nature of the Euro at its inception and the hide the salami what institutions are flat on their asses is just stringing the pain out.

the euro was dead the day it was created, the funeral is coming, it should be tomorrow.
 
 
Ekrem is correct. Real wages have risen too much in the south relative to the north. The EU does not have the institutions to address the imbalances that have arisen. That's the political problem you correctly identified.

Options Dwindle for Euro Crisis

The biggest question in Europe isn't what it was a few weeks ago. It is no longer just whether any of the 17 governments in the euro zone will default on its debts; increasingly it is whether the euro zone will survive in its current form at all.

On Thursday, it emerged that the European Central Bank is considering a dramatic extension of its longest loans to commercial banks, to stave off a potential collapse of the bloc's banking system.

Meanwhile, leaders of the Continent's three largest economies met and pledged to work toward the closer political and economic integration most analysts say is needed—but with no specifics, meaning the pace for such efforts still lags behind the market's demand.

Germany's failure to sell almost 40% of a €6 billion ($8 billion) bond issue at an auction Wednesday is, many analysts say, symptomatic of this new phase of the crisis, with investors beginning to question even the bloc's safest harbors.

Some experts think the poor auction result has been over-interpreted; they note that German yields remain at historic and healthy lows and that demand for them may momentarily be weakened by the recent flight to them from the increasingly risky bonds of their southern neighbors.

But on Thursday, concern over German bonds drove their yields up to near-convergence with the U.K.'s sovereign debt, which has no clear advantage beyond not being in euros. In recent weeks, borrowing costs for financially strong euro-zone governments such as the Netherlands and Finland have increased. Other high-rated European bonds—such as those for the European Financial Stability Facility—have struggled to find buyers.

If the first phase of the crisis saw investors fleeing from the periphery of the currency union to its core, the second has them fleeing the euro area altogether.

the euro was dead the day it was created, the funeral is coming, it should be tomorrow.
 
Behind the EU and  are not only economic interests but enormous strategic interests.
It's not dead because you wish it to be dead.

Forget Greece, read about corruption in Romania and Bulgaria who are already EU members and should one day enter -zone. There's significant mentality differences in some parts of Europe.
States need to be organized in an effective way and they need to increase tax revenues, EU has major plans from common defense policy (Army) to achieving the switch to green energy. All which needs money.
No dolce-vita or corruption, and for this to happen there is no path other than centralization.

I wouldn't bet on 's "funeral". It's more likely, that -zone will transform from a union of equals to a union controlled by the heavyweights. If the smaller states don't like it, they'll have to leave , go bankrupt and will be bought anyway by the heavyweights.
In some parts of -zone they already can't pay the social benefits without next payment tranches from EU-IMF, and their governments have been replaced by technocrats who do as they're told to do.

Since 's introduction it has happened 12 times already, that Germany couldn't sell her bonds completely. On 4 occasions Germany sold less than 65% of the volume it paced for sale. The 10-year interest was very low, lower than inflation.
At a higher interest there would've been more demand.

I posted it also in another thread:
Germany also brought 3-month bonds to the market this month.
0.08% interest.

Why should investors continue to buy such kind of bonds when they can buy other European bonds with much higher interest for which ECB&Germany indirectly stand as security (Greek bailout).
 
 
The euro is down to $1.33.
 
 
 
It is a problem for the same reason why it is a problem in Italy and Greece - the Spanish economy is not productive enough to grow at a fast enough rate to outgrow its debt.

The fact that Spain's debt would "only" be 80% of GDP isn't particularly relevant. There is no magical threshold that a nation crosses when it suddenly becomes a problem. Countries have defaulted when debt to GDP was 60%. At other times, countries have not defaulted until debt has reached 130%. Reinhardt and Rogoff have estimated that on average, a nation becomes vulnerable when debt hits 90%, but default can occur at much lower or much higher levels. Japan is much higher and they have not defaulted. It depends on the vagaries of the market. And when the market stresses, the first to go are the weakest. Spain is highly-indebted weak economy that uses a German currency. That is a bad recipe.
 
And you dont get it...it is relevant the % of GDP numbers. They are the numbers being used to drive markets and countries into the ground by the media and the big financial institutions because they are easily digestible by the Joe Public. And the longer the crisis goes on because of lack of consumer demand and out right depression in the consumer mind, the more money some people are making....

Also we are still in the economic crisis started in 2008! The Spanish economy is weak, just like pretty much every economy because of the ramifications from the 2008 US sub-prime crash. Spain grew 4% or so in 2007 and had a massive budget surplus! Granted that was on the backs of the building boom, but still it grew.

The problem is people like you seem to think that Spanish, Italian and so on economies will be flat lining and not growing at all forever. How realistic is that? Already the crisis has brought key changes in Spanish labour and business law, and with the new conservative government I suspect even more are on the way.

 
Left-wingers whine about the market and don't understand it. It wasn't an issue for the past 20 years because the market did not perceive it to be an issue. It's not surprising that it is happening now because the market is figuring out the illogic of the eurozone as constructed. It didn't matter when debts were lower and growth was higher. It is happening now because the market has decided to make it an issue now.
 
And right wingers think the markets are the best thing since swiss chocolate... which is also a load of bullshit as we have seen time and time again when the supposed "free markets" have screwed up.

The market fear on debt is highly biased towards certain nations and areas of the world and that is solely due to the Anglo-American influence on the financial world. Look at yesterday... Thanksgiving in the US.. the world markets are still up and running, but the financial TV stations (owned by Americans) cant be bothered to show European market moves but show repeats of documentaries of mostly US companies and thanksgiving shows... who the FUCK cares about some stupid American holiday... the markets are open and should be reported from.

The illogical part is the markets, they do not behave as they should because of huge bias towards the Anglo-American sphere of influence. For the love of god, the UK and US have massive deficits and zero plans to fix them and their debts are rising faster than anyone else (even Greece) and they still have some of the lowest yields out there... how logical is that?

 
In times of stress, the first to get cut off from the capital markets are the weakest credits. We are in a time of stress because European banks have too little equity and European countries have too much debt and not enough growth. When things are good, the cracks can be papered over. When things turn bad, those cracks get exposed. Overlay that with the internal illogic of the eurozone and you have a sovereign debt crisis.
 
Hog wash excuses for a broken market. European banks have plenty of equity on average, not to mention they will always have the backing of the national government when it comes to peoples money in the banks, and as for European countries having too much debt and not enough growth.. then answer me this..

Why is the UK having some of the lowest yields on the books, and yet its growth is basically negative since the only thing that made the UK economy grow last quarter was government spending.. and its deficit is at record highs as is its lending...

And you forget yet again.. we are in an economic crisis thanks to the 2008 US sub-prime crash and in crisis there is no growth since the average person does not have the money or/and faith to go out and consume, which like it or not is a huge portion of most economies.

 
The euro as designed was destined to fail. The math and logic of it - despite the protestations of dreamy-eyed idealists - does not work. It is fundamentally flawed economically.
 
No, it is flawed politically. The political aspects were not put in place for it to act like it should on an economic scale. That is fixable if the will is there. And dont bring math and logic into a political discussion, since you will loose every time. The Euro does work up to a point and it is up to the dreamy-eyed idealists to take it to the next level... question is if they are willing to do that. Considering the benefits of the Euro, then I hope they do and ignore the Anglo-American "experts" who are against the Euro and who have a vested interest in seeing it go away... world economic domination.

 
It can work if the more productive north decides to subsidize the less productive south forever, or if the south becomes as productive as the north (and that's not going to happen). So if the German, Dutch and Finnish taxpayer wants to send their money south forever, or if the Spanish, Italians and Greeks want to be as productive as the north, then the euro experiment can work. Otherwise, it will fail as is. And it is failing now.
 
Sorry but this text book bulllshit that has no sense of reality. The very idea that Germany and the other northern "non Eurozone" countries some how have been "bailing-out" the South for a long while is utter bullshit. If you had any clue on the Italian bond market, and on the situation in Spain then you would know otherwise.

The problem in Spain is the labour market. It is very un-flexable. In Italy it is closed industries, that does not allow new members and hence competition. But like it or not, Northern Italy is competitive and productive as Germany even with this handicap. Fix these issue and you will change everything, something that the doom and gloom right wingers in the UK and US funny enough forget to mention.

 
BofA is undercapitalized, but the American banks - including BofA - have raised hundreds of billions of dollars in equity and have removed hundreds of billions of dollars of bad assets off their books. They are far, far better off than the European banks today. This is not seriously debated by anyone.
 
Yes they have the ability to dump their bad assets on the US tax payer... If it had not been for Fannie and Freddie, then the US banks would be in a real shitter.

 
The European banks, for the most part, denied there was a problem, and resisted raising equity. Now, they are woefully undercapitalized. Dexia is done. The Landesbanks in Germany are essentially insolvent. The Spanish banks are bouyed by their Latin American assets but have their heads in the sand regarding their domestic market. The Greek banks will be on life support.
 
The Spanish banks dont have their head in the sand.. quite the opposite. As for the rest. utter bullshit propoganda. Dexia is gone.. so fucking what? America looses banks almost daily lol. And Dexia is not gone per-say but sold off... that is how the markets work.. Landesbanks in Germany are insolvent? HAHHAHA. You do know what Landesbanks are right? Are you saying that the German state is now insolvent?

 
And Italian banks are dumping their Italian bonds.
 
And this shows you have no clue on what is going on.

 
European banks have been playing Pretend for some time now. They have refused to shop their pools of assets because it would have required them taking marks on the loan books, which would have demonstrated they are woefully undercapitalized. So they pretended there wasn't a problem. Now the market is forcing them to dump their assets and shrink their balance sheets, and the banks hoping to buy enough time to find a solution. They have to because they are shopping their best assets. The best assets will get sold and the shittiest assets will get dumped on to the balance sheets of the states.
 
You do realise that you can exchange European with American right? You claim we have been ignoring our problems, when America is the country with a clusterfuck political system that cant agree on anything, has a huge deficit, massive debt on every level of government, and a massive personal debt of its citizens, and you say we are ignoring our problems? They are small compared to the hole the US is in and is ignoring totally by shifting focus to Europe and random war.... at least our personal debt levels in Europe are pathetically low (minus the UK) when compared to the US.... and yes that is important... very important even with our government debt levels.

 
I'm not the one claiming sainthood. But we've gone through the fire, we've taken our medicine, and we aren't blaming anyone else.
 
What medicine lol? Nothing has changed in the US. No new regulations to prevent the crap happening again, no break up of the "too big to fail" banks (they have in fact gotten bigger and even more dangerous), zero consequences for those who created and caused the crisis and more and more secret subsidy payments to the banking sector via tax breaks, and Fannie and Freddie. So what "medicine" did you exactly take... kicking more people out on the street, making more people poor in the US?

 
You're the one blaming your problems on others, brushing Europe's internal problems aside as if they are easily solvable - "Oh, Italy will be fine once it liberalizes its labour markets." Yeah, good luck with that. Your banks are woefully undercapitalized and they resist doing anything about it. Don't blame others if you got sold. You sucked up the easy credit. You bought the store. That's on you.
 
Oh it is on us, but we did not start the cheap credit craze nor the current economic crisis... that is what we blame rightfully on the US.

And yes it is easy to fix if given time. I have seen it done in Denmark and am seeing it being done in Spain. 5 years ago changes to the Spanish labour market laws would have been political suicide for any side of the political spectrum, but now both sides and the unions even are talking about it and have implemented changes. It can be done. What you want is changes over night, and that is impossible even for the US.... well especially the US. You have trillions you need to cut from your budget and yet you cant even agree on basic common sense cuts without making it into a political clusterfuck of a political ideology fight.

 
Yeah, right. Get back to us when the IMF is involved in bailing out America like it is in Europe.
 
The IMF wont bail-out the US.. cant afford it. Which is in part why the world seems to ignore for now the big elephant in the room and its problems.

The sad thing is, when Europe fixes its problems, then we still have to deal with the collapse of the US... guess we got to take one problem at a time.
 
 
 
 
One of the better discussion happening on this board.

Thanks for your input boys.

Clearly you're paying closer attention to the machinations of Europes debt crises than I am and I appreciate your POVs about it.

Well there's differences of opinion regarding the issues at hand but at least the debate is about the issue, and it hasn't devolved into two or three clueless people trading personal insults.

If I can weight in here about this issue?

We have too much paper that represents assets that were overvalued.

SOMEBODY is going to have to take a haricut sooner or later.

If, as has been suggested, the Euro banks refuse to acknowedge that the debt insturments they are holding ar over valued?

The market is going to take them to school.
 
 
 
 
Ekrem is correct. Real wages have risen too much in the south relative to the north, and the EU does not have the institutions to address the imbalances that have arisen.
 
uhm....ok. Oh and pension costs..lets not forget those.  

oh, and, who are you talking too btw?  
 
I'm talking to both of you. You both have hit the problem correctly.

Ekrem is correct because he has boiled down the fundamental problem in one sentence - southern wages are too high relative to their productivity. You've hit the political problem since the eurozone as originally configured did not create the institutions to deal with the imbalances within the eurozone.
 
 
 
And you dont get it...it is relevant the % of GDP numbers. They are the numbers being used to drive markets and countries into the ground by the media and the big financial institutions because they are easily digestible by the Joe Public. And the longer the crisis goes on because of lack of consumer demand and out right depression in the consumer mind, the more money some people are making....
 
Weird conspiracy theories about the press and financial companies conspiring to drive countries into the ground undermines your credibility, just as it does when you evoke the same conspiracy theories about ratings agencies.

It appears that you either did not read or you did not comprehend what I wrote since I cited debt levels to GDP. There is no magical threshold at which countries run into financial stress. Some countries have defaulted at 60% debt to GDP, others not until 130% or higher. The European countries are in the danger zone. The fact that they have gone a long time with high debt levels is not relevant. What is relevant is that it becomes an issue when financial markets are under duress.

 
Also we are still in the economic crisis started in 2008! The Spanish economy is weak, just like pretty much every economy because of the ramifications from the 2008 US sub-prime crash. Spain grew 4% or so in 2007 and had a massive budget surplus! Granted that was on the backs of the building boom, but still it grew.

The problem is people like you seem to think that Spanish, Italian and so on economies will be flat lining and not growing at all forever. How realistic is that? Already the crisis has brought key changes in Spanish labour and business law, and with the new conservative government I suspect even more are on the way.
 
Spain grew as strong as it did because it had a massive building boom. Spain had its own housing bubble. Spain feasted on easy credit. Spain crashed because of Spain, not because of the US. Germany didn't crash because of the US because Germany didn't have the structural imbalances Spain had. But Spain did have the structural imbalances, so it crashed. That had nothing to do with the US.

And nobody said that they didn't expect the Italian and Spanish economies to not grow forever.

 
The illogical part is the markets, they do not behave as they should because of huge bias towards the Anglo-American sphere of influence. For the love of god, the UK and US have massive deficits and zero plans to fix them and their debts are rising faster than anyone else (even Greece) and they still have some of the lowest yields out there... how logical is that?
 
Until a few days ago, Germany had lower yields than the US. Japan has lower yields than the US. That's partly because Japan has its own currency and the ECB is an extension of the Bundesbank. Yields are rising in Europe because the rot is spreading from the periphery to the core as markets perceive that French and German governments will eventually have to bail out the PIIGS. The euro is like the old gold standard to the peripheral nations. Investors see defaults and no ability to affect monetary policy.

It's not surprising that US yields are low. The US is the biggest, strongest economy in the world and the dollar is the reserve currency, so this is where investors flee for safety. But you make the mistake in assuming this is not logical because yields are low in the US right now. They might not be in the future. Financial crises start at the weakest links then spread out. There could be a dollar crisis and spike in Treasury yields in the future.

 
Hog wash excuses for a broken market. European banks have plenty of equity on average,
 
No, they do not. You are wrong.

 
not to mention they will always have the backing of the national government when it comes to peoples money in the banks,
 
But you are probably right here. I expect that if there are bank failures, then the European governments will back stop them. But it is unknown what is going to happen, so investors sell first and banks stop lending to each other, or do so at higher prices, which is what is happening now.

 
and as for European countries having too much debt and not enough growth.. then answer me this..

Why is the UK having some of the lowest yields on the books, and yet its growth is basically negative since the only thing that made the UK economy grow last quarter was government spending.. and its deficit is at record highs as is its lending...
 
For two reasons. First, when growth is low, interest rates fall as demand for credit declines. That is standard. The second reason is because the UK uses its own currency. The problem in the eurozone is not just the risk of default but also the inability of nations to be able to respond their own problems. The logic of the eurozone does not work because the PIIGS are subject to German monetary policy. This makes it more likely that the haircuts bondholders would endure would be even greater than if they had their own currencies because they will need to reduce their debts by even more to grow than if they had their own currencies.

And again, you are making the mistake by looking at what is happening right now. British interest rates may be much higher in the future if investors think Britain will default.

 
No, it is flawed politically. The political aspects were not put in place for it to act like it should on an economic scale. That is fixable if the will is there. And dont bring math and logic into a political discussion, since you will loose every time. The Euro does work up to a point and it is up to the dreamy-eyed idealists to take it to the next level... question is if they are willing to do that. Considering the benefits of the Euro, then I hope they do and ignore the Anglo-American "experts" who are against the Euro and who have a vested interest in seeing it go away... world economic domination.
 
Your arguments would have more credence if you didn't think everyone was out to get you.

As I have repeatedly said in this thread, the eurozone can work if the more productive nations are willing to subsidize the less productive nations, or if the less productive nations become more productive. This is primarily a political problem. But to ignore the math is to ignore reality. The math doesn't work for the eurozone as currently configured. The graves are filled with dreamy idealists.

 
Sorry but this text book bulllshit that has no sense of reality. The very idea that Germany and the other northern "non Eurozone" countries some how have been "bailing-out" the South for a long while is utter bullshit. If you had any clue on the Italian bond market, and on the situation in Spain then you would know otherwise.

The problem in Spain is the labour market. It is very un-flexable. In Italy it is closed industries, that does not allow new members and hence competition. But like it or not, Northern Italy is competitive and productive as Germany even with this handicap. Fix these issue and you will change everything, something that the doom and gloom right wingers in the UK and US funny enough forget to mention.
 
Again, you either did not read what I said or did not comprehend it. So I will post it again.

 
It can work if the more productive north decides to subsidize the less productive south forever, or if the south becomes as productive as the north (and that's not going to happen). So if the German, Dutch and Finnish taxpayer wants to send their money south forever, or if the Spanish, Italians and Greeks want to be as productive as the north, then the euro experiment can work. Otherwise, it will fail as is. And it is failing now.
 
I don't know if English is your first language or not, but I have highlighted the tenses. I did not say that the north has been bailing out the south, as you claim. I said that the eurozone can work if the north decides to send resources to the south. One is past tense, one is future tense.

The eurozone can also work if the south becomes as productive as the north. I agree with you regarding Spanish labour laws and Italian industries. Those are examples of countries becoming more efficient. Will those reforms occur, and will they be enough? I don't know. I doubt it but maybe I'm wrong.

As for the Italian bond market, I know a little bit about it. I know that the €1.9 trillion dollar BTP market is primarily a domestic one. So your bent of this being some Anglo-American conspiracy is pretty silly since it is the Italians who dominate that market.

 
Yes they have the ability to dump their bad assets on the US tax payer... If it had not been for Fannie and Freddie, then the US banks would be in a real shitter.
 
They also dumped their shitty loans onto the FDIC, the Fed, and an alphabet soup of programs designed to offload bad loans to investors, and the SEC suspended mark to market accounting. But they were also required to raise hundreds of billions of dollars in capital, sell assets, and recapitalize. For the most part, they did. But this did not happen on the same scale in Europe. So today, European banks are weaker than American banks in general. Of course you can always find one off examples, i.e. BofA, but in aggregate, American banks are stronger.

 
The Spanish banks dont have their head in the sand.. quite the opposite. As for the rest. utter bullshit propoganda. Dexia is gone.. so fucking what? America looses banks almost daily lol. And Dexia is not gone per-say but sold off... that is how the markets work.. Landesbanks in Germany are insolvent? HAHHAHA. You do know what Landesbanks are right? Are you saying that the German state is now insolvent?

... And this shows you have no clue on what is going on.
 
Actually, almost all of the people whom we have hired to do the work for us are European. They have been into most of the European central banks and regulatory authorities. We have people on the ground in Spain, France and Germany digging deep into the banks.

And yes, based on their work, the Landesbanks are effectively insolvent if you mark their books to market. The German banks, in aggregate, are the most undercapitalized in the developed world. Of course, surely you understand that doesn't mean the German state is insolvent, since the state can raise taxes and recapitalize the banks. If you're a dreamy euro idealist, this fact facilitates Germany eventually cutting a deal because it's banks aren't strong enough to withstand a tremendous shock to the eurozone system.

 
What medicine lol? Nothing has changed in the US. No new regulations to prevent the crap happening again, no break up of the "too big to fail" banks (they have in fact gotten bigger and even more dangerous), zero consequences for those who created and caused the crisis and more and more secret subsidy payments to the banking sector via tax breaks, and Fannie and Freddie. So what "medicine" did you exactly take... kicking more people out on the street, making more people poor in the US?
 
The medicine we took was the write down hundreds of billions of dollars worth of loans, took massive losses, sold assets and raised hundreds of billions of dollars in equity, eviscerating shareholders. That hasn't happened in Europe yet. But it will.

I wish I could disagree with you that things have otherwise fundamentally changed, but I can't.
 
 
 
 
the euro was dead the day it was created, the funeral is coming, it should be tomorrow.
 
Behind the EU and  are not only economic interests but enormous strategic interests.
It's not dead because you wish it to be dead.

Forget Greece, read about corruption in Romania and Bulgaria who are already EU members and should one day enter -zone. There's significant mentality differences in some parts of Europe.
States need to be organized in an effective way and they need to increase tax revenues, EU has major plans from common defense policy (Army) to achieving the switch to green energy. All which needs money.
No dolce-vita or corruption, and for this to happen there is no path other than centralization.

German Finance Minister:

 
We can only achieve a political union if we have a crisis,

I wouldn't bet on 's "funeral". It's more likely, that -zone will transform from a union of equals to a union controlled by the heavyweights. If the smaller states don't like it, they'll have to leave , go bankrupt and will be bought anyway by the heavyweights.
In some parts of -zone they already can't pay the social benefits without next payment tranches from EU-IMF, and their governments have been replaced by technocrats who do as they're told to do.
 

first- I don't wish it dead.   you are it appears taken up by the very same emotion that created it, you THINK it should be and WANT it to be, except, social-human mechanics says- it CANNOT be.

I think it should die becasue its a mess and was never well thought out, as they began almost immediately to break their own rules....anyway, its going t happen, becasue thats the reality.

Italian Yields Jump After Poor Auction

FRANKFURTItalian two-year and five-year government-bond yields soared to euro-era highs Friday as investors began giving up on the euro zone's ability to break the political gridlock that is blocking a more decisive response to the currency bloc's debt crisis.

Italian two-year and five-year yields climbed to 7.7% and 7.8%, respectively, and the 10-year yield moved further above the key 7% mark to 7.3%.

I think the euro is going to survive but it is not inconceivable that it won't.

 
As the Italian government struggled to borrow and Spain considered seeking an international bail-out, British ministers privately warned that the break-up of the euro, once almost unthinkable, is now increasingly plausible.

Diplomats are preparing to help Britons abroad through a banking collapse and even riots arising from the debt crisis.

The Treasury confirmed earlier this month that contingency planning for a collapse is now under way.

A senior minister has now revealed the extent of the Government’s concern, saying that Britain is now planning on the basis that a euro collapse is now just a matter of time.

“It’s in our interests that they keep playing for time because that gives us more time to prepare,” the minister told the Daily Telegraph.

Recent Foreign and Commonwealth Office instructions to embassies and consulates request contingency planning for extreme scenarios including rioting and social unrest.

Greece has seen several outbreaks of civil disorder as its government struggles with its huge debts. British officials think similar scenes cannot be ruled out in other nations if the euro collapses.

Diplomats have also been told to prepare to help tens of thousands of British citizens in eurozone countries with the consequences of a financial collapse that would leave them unable to access bank accounts or even withdraw cash.

Fuelling the fears of financial markets for the euro, reports in Madrid yesterday suggested that the new Popular Party government could seek a bail-out from either the European Union rescue fund or the International Monetary Fund.

There are also growing fears for Italy, whose new government was forced to pay record interest rates on new bonds issued yesterday.

The yield on new six-month loans was 6.5 per cent, nearly double last month’s rate. And the yield on outstanding two-year loans was 7.8 per cent, well above the level considered unsustainable.

Italy’s new government will have to sell more than EURO 30 billion of new bonds by the end of January to refinance its debts. Analysts say there is no guarantee that investors will buy all of those bonds, which could force Italy to default.

The Italian government yesterday said that in talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy, Prime Minister Mario Monti had agreed that an Italian collapse “would inevitably be the end of the euro.”

The EU treaties that created the euro and set its membership rules contain no provision for members to leave, meaning any break-up would be disorderly and potentially chaotic.

If eurozone governments defaulted on their debts, the European banks that hold many of their bonds would risk collapse.

Merkel's opposition to eurobonds.

 
Angela Merkel's response could hardly have been clearer. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso on Wednesday presented a study outlining the possible forms euro bonds could take -- whereupon the German chancellor found unusually unambiguous words in response. The proposal, she said, was "extraordinarily distressing." She also called it "inappropriate."

The reaction was unusually firm for Merkel. She has become notorious in Germany for shying away from positions that can't be wriggled out of later. But when it comes to pooling the debt of all euro-zone member states in the form of euro bonds, she has long been firm in her rejection. In December 2010, for example, she said "the euro zone needs more harmony and competitiveness rather than common euro-zone bonds." In September, she called euro bonds "absolutely wrong." Wednesday's outburst, in other words, should not come as a surprise....

Germany has largely isolated itself in the ongoing European discussion over what steps should next be taken to confront the euro crisis. Governments across the Continent are clamoring for a solution. And analysts around the world have come to the conclusion that the spread of Europe's ongoing debt crisis can only be halted by implementing one -- or both -- of two methods: Either debt must be pooled in the form of euro bonds, or the European Central Bank must become the lender of last resort by buying up massive quantities of sovereign bonds from indebted euro-zone members.

Virtually all euro-zone members have thrown their support behind one of those two antidotes. Germany, though, has firmly opposed both. Berlin fears that massive ECB bond purchases could significantly drive up inflation (indeed, it evokes fears of 1920s hyperinflation in the country) and sacrifice the independence of the Frankfurt institution, which was modelled after the German central bank, the Bundesbank, that for decades served as guardian of the highly stable deutsche mark. And it's opposition to euro bonds? SPIEGEL ONLINE provides an overview of the most important reasons.

... Euro bonds, though, would essentially transform Germany -- and its solid, AAA credit rating -- into the strongest guarantor of collectivized euro-zone debt. And, should worse come to worst, German taxpayers would, once again, be forced to fork over. That, at least, would appear to be the widespread fear. A survey performed by Emnid in August found that fully 76 percent of Germans oppose euro bonds, with only 15 percent in favor....

Less than 2 percent. That was the interest rate being commanded by German 10-year government Bund bonds on Wednesday. Indeed, there are some analysts who would argue that Berlin's inability to find buyers for its entire bond issue was not necessarily an indication of growing wariness of euro-zone debt. Rather, it showed merely that, with such a low return, they simply weren't all that attractive.

That particular view of the situation was not widely shared, however. Most saw the shortfall as another sign that the euro-zone crisis is frightening investors off. And on Thursday, interest rates on German bonds shot upwards to 2.26 percent. "This is just one auction," Don Smith, an analyst with ICAP, told the Financial Times. "But there is a growing feeling among many in the markets that the crisis is heading one way -- and that is towards the break-up of the euro zone."...

By pooling euro-zone debt, however, euro bonds would likely make it more expensive for Germany to borrow. Some models under consideration would, of course, allow Germany to continue to issue its own sovereign bonds. But it seems certain that the interest rates on those bonds, too, would rise were the country to become a guarantor of pooled euro-zone debt. And with a debt load of over 2.2 trillion, representing 81.2 percent of the country's gross domestic product, a lasting increase in German bond yields would translate to billions more needed to service that debt.

In September, Germany's Constitutional Court handed down a landmark ruling on the country's participation in bailout efforts for Greece and for other heavily indebted euro-zone countries. While the court allowed Berlin to go ahead on its planned support for the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), it made it clear that any additional moves to aid fellow euro-zone member states would be viewed negatively.

Specifically, the ruling clearly indicated that Germany's constitution frowns on any permanent mechanism to transfer German taxpayer money to foreign countries in the form of a bailout. The larger such payments are, the larger the frown. The court also specifically warned against a situation whereby foreign governments could trigger payments of German guarantees through their actions....

euro bonds would be an entirely different case. Wolfgang Münchau, the Financial Times columnist who recently began writing editorials for SPIEGEL ONLINE, points out that they would be everything that the German Constitutional Court finds questionable about bailout programs thus far. They would have the potential to make Germany liable for debts incurred by other countries in the euro zone, the program would be huge (otherwise there would be no point in introducing them in the first place) and German guarantees could be triggered by the actions of foreign governments. "The court's verdict leaves me no alternative but to conclude that (euro bonds) are indeed unconstitutional," Münchau wrote in the Financial Times in September....

Now an even bigger calamity is looking likelier. The intensifying financial pressure raises the chances of a disorderly default by a government, a run of retail deposits on banks short of cash, or a revolt against austerity that would mark the start of the break-up of the euro zone....

Consider the three ingredients for recession: a credit crunch, tighter fiscal policy and a dearth of confidence. In aggregate, European banks loans exceed their deposits, so they rely on wholesale fundsshort-term bills, longer-term bonds or loans from other banksto bridge the gap. But investors are becoming warier of lending to banks that have euro-zone bonds on their books and that can no longer rely on the backing of governments with borrowing troubles of their own. Long-term bond issues have become scarce and American money-market funds, hitherto buyers of short-term bank bills, are running scared....

The drying-up of funding for sovereigns and for banks is a threat to the integrity of the euro, because of the stark divide between debtor and creditor countries within the zone....

During the credit boom, cheap capital flowed into Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain to finance trade deficits and housing booms. As a result, the net foreign liabilitieswhat businesses, householders and government owe to foreigners, less the foreign assets they ownof all four are close to 100% of GDP. (By comparison, Americas net foreign liabilities are 17% of GDP.) Much of their debt is being financed by local bank borrowing or bonds sold to investors in creditor countries, such as Germany. Ireland is unusual in that a large chunk of what it owes is in the form of equity (all those American-owned factories and offices) and so does not need to be refinanced.

 

With a few exceptions, the benchmark cost of credit in each euro-zone country is related to the balance of its international debts. Germany, which is owed more than it owes, still has low bond yields; Greece, which is heavily in debt to foreigners, has a high cost of borrowing (see chart 2). Portugal, Greece and (to a lesser extent) Spain still have big current-account deficits, and so are still adding to their already high foreign liabilities. Refinancing these is becoming harder and putting strain on local banks and credit availability.

The higher the cost of funding becomes, the more money flows out to foreigners to service these debts. This is why the issue of national solvency goes beyond what governments owe. The euro zone is showing the symptoms of an internal balance-of-payments crisis, with self-fulfilling runs on countries, because at bottom that is the nature of its troubles. And such crises put extraordinary pressure on exchange-rate pegs, no matter how permanent policymakers claim them to be.

One of the initial attractions of euro membership for peripheral countriesaccess to cheap fundsno longer applies. If a messy default is forced upon a euro-zone country, it might be tempted to reinvent its own currency. Indeed, it may have little option. That way, at least, it could write down the value of its private and public debts, as well as cutting its wages and prices relative to those abroad, improving its competitiveness. The switch would be hugely costly for debtors and creditors alike. But the alternative is scarcely more appealing. Austerity, high unemployment, social unrest, high borrowing costs and banking chaos seem likely either way....

Market gurus and other students of misaligned stock, bond or home prices often say that although it is easy to spot an asset-price bubble, it is impossible to know the event that finally pricks it. In much the same way, the likeliest trigger for a disintegration of the euro is unknowable. But there are plenty of candidates....

 ...well yes it can go either way.

I will say- it won't. It can't.

for this carefully contrived house of cards to survive, whats required is a total, and I mean total restructuring in how the weaker gov.s do biz. and I mean from who gets a truck drivers license to who gets to open a pharmacy, thats how much control some of these nations states have over enterprise in their countries. This and the welfare state cum pension system cannot survive in the form its natives demand as they have become accustomed to it.

to say that they, the great unwashed would take a bath in newly minted or from under the mattress poorer than euro drachmas/francs etc. if they jumped the euro is an argument in MITIGATION.

they are boxed in and what is true when he said it is still true today in every use;

Europe's Leaders Pursue New Pact
Deal Would Bring Closer Fiscal Ties

BERLIN—Euro-zone leaders are negotiating a potentially groundbreaking fiscal pact aimed at preventing the currency bloc from fracturing by tethering its members even closer together.

The proposal, which hasn't yet been agreed to, would make budget discipline legally binding and enforceable by European authorities. Officials regard the moves as a first step toward closer fiscal and economic coordination within the currency area. That would mark a seminal shift in the governance of the 17-nation euro-zone.

European officials hope a new agreement, which would aim to shrink the excessive public debt that helped spark the crisis, would persuade the European Central Bank to undertake more drastic action to reverse the recent selloff in euro-zone debt markets.

The proposed pact represents the boldest attempt by Europe's leaders to halt the spread of the crisis since they agreed in July to offer Greece a new bailout and to bolster the region's bailout fund. Those steps, initially hailed as a breakthrough, quickly proved insufficient.

snip-

As recently as this summer, measures such as a centralized fiscal-enforcement authority with power to seize control of national budgets would have been viewed in most capitals as an unacceptable invasion of sovereignty. That such steps are now under serious consideration reflects the perilous turn the crisis has taken in recent months.

didn't they have rules in the Maastricht treaty that demanded gdp debt ration limits etc etc? now they think that say Greece et al will turn over the direct power to allocate national departmental funding to...the EU? seriously?

In effect this would be tantamount to say, allowing Peking to dictate our budget if sold them bonds.....

They are desperate now, that is clear, I can smell it.

Yes, that treaty has to be changed and ratified. Which is problematical, there's some countries who won't give up any part of their sovereignty. Some countries are gonna pull out, the question is who and when. Don't know that anybody cares a whole lot about Greece, but Italy is another matter.
 
 
Interesting take by Peter Schiff.....well worth the time to read.

 
With fiscal time bombs ticking in both Europe and the United States, the pertinent question for now seems to be which will explode first. For much of the past few months it looked as if Europe was set to blow. But Angela Merkel's refusal to support a Federal Reserve style bailout of European sovereigns and her recent statement the she had no Hank Paulson style fiscal bazooka in her handbag, has lowered the heat. In contrast, the utter failure of the Congressional Super Committee in the United States to come up with any shred of success in addressing America's fiscal problems has sparked a renewed realization that America's fuse is dangerously short.

Chancellor Merkel has been emphatic that European politicians not be given a monetary crutch similar to the one relied on by their American counterparts. Her laudable goal, much derided on the editorial pages of the New York Times, is to defuse Europe's debt bomb with substantive budget reforms, and as a result to make the euro "the strongest currency in the world." Much has been made of the poorly received auction today of German Government bonds, with some saying the lack of demand (which pushed yields on 10-year German Bonds past 2% --hardly indicative of panic selling) is evidence of investor unease with Merkel's economic policies. I would argue the opposite: that many investors still think that Merkel is bluffing and that eventually Germany will print and stimulate like everyone else. It is likely for this reason that yields on German debt have increased modestly.

In contrast, the U.S. is crystal clear in its intention to ignore its debt problems. With the failure of the Super Committee this week it actually became official. American politicians will not, under any circumstances willingly confront our underlying debt crisis. While the outcome of the Super Committee shouldn't have come as a great surprise, the sheer dysfunction displayed should serve as a wakeup call for those who still harbor any desperate illusions. Some members of Congress, such as John McCain, have even come out against the $1.2 trillion in automatic spending cuts that would go into effect in January 2013. Expect more politicians of both parties to cravenly follow suit.

Over the next decade, the U.S. government expects to spend more than $40 trillion. Even if the $1.2 trillion in automatic cuts are allowed to go through, the amount totals just 3% of the expected outlays. In a masterstroke of hypocritical accounting, $216 billion of these proposed "cuts" merely represent the expected reductions in interest payments that would result from $984 billion of actual cuts. These cuts won't make a noticeable dent in our projected deficits, which if history can be any guide, will likely rise by much more as economic reality proves far gloomier than government statisticians predict. Finally, the cuts are not cuts in the ordinary sense of the word, where spending is actually reduced. They are cuts in the baseline, which means spending merely increases less than what was previously budgeted.

In the mean time, the prospect of sovereign default in Europe is driving "safe" haven demand for the dollar. So contrary to the political blame game, Europe's problems are actually providing a temporary boost to America's bubble economy. However, a resolution to the crisis in Europe could reverse those flows. And given the discipline emanating from Berlin, a real solution is not out of the question. If confidence can be restored there, each episodic flight to safety may be less focused on the U.S. dollar. Instead, risk-averse investors may prefer a basket of other, higher-yielding, more fiscally sustainable currencies.

The irony is that Europe is actually being criticized for its failure to follow America's lead. This misplaced criticism is based on the mistaken belief that our approach worked. It did not. Sure, it may have delayed the explosion, but only by assuring a much larger one in the future. In the mean time, many have mistaken the delay for success.

However, if Merkel's hard line works, and real cuts follow, Europe will be praised for blazing a different trail. As a result the euro could rally and the dollar sinks. Commodity prices will rise, putting even more upward pressure on consumer prices and interest rates in the United States.

Any significant reversal of the current upward dollar trend could provide a long awaited catalyst for nations holding large dollar reserves to diversify into other currencies. My guess is that Merkel understands the great advantage the U.S. has enjoyed as the issuer of the world's reserve currency. I believe she covets that prize for Europe, and based on her strategy, it is clearly within her reach.

There is an old saving that one often does not appreciate what one has until it's lost. The nearly criminal foolishness now on display in Washington may finally force the rest of the world to cancel our reserve currency privileges. The loss may give Americans a profound appreciation of this concept.
 

 
 
 
Interesting take by Peter Schiff.....well worth the time to read.

 
With fiscal time bombs ticking in both Europe and the United States, the pertinent question for now seems to be which will explode first. For much of the past few months it looked as if Europe was set to blow. But Angela Merkel's refusal to support a Federal Reserve style bailout of European sovereigns and her recent statement the she had no Hank Paulson style fiscal bazooka in her handbag, has lowered the heat. In contrast, the utter failure of the Congressional Super Committee in the United States to come up with any shred of success in addressing America's fiscal problems has sparked a renewed realization that America's fuse is dangerously short.

Chancellor Merkel has been emphatic that European politicians not be given a monetary crutch similar to the one relied on by their American counterparts. Her laudable goal, much derided on the editorial pages of the New York Times, is to defuse Europe's debt bomb with substantive budget reforms, and as a result to make the euro "the strongest currency in the world." Much has been made of the poorly received auction today of German Government bonds, with some saying the lack of demand (which pushed yields on 10-year German Bonds past 2% --hardly indicative of panic selling) is evidence of investor unease with Merkel's economic policies. I would argue the opposite: that many investors still think that Merkel is bluffing and that eventually Germany will print and stimulate like everyone else. It is likely for this reason that yields on German debt have increased modestly.

In contrast, the U.S. is crystal clear in its intention to ignore its debt problems. With the failure of the Super Committee this week it actually became official. American politicians will not, under any circumstances willingly confront our underlying debt crisis. While the outcome of the Super Committee shouldn't have come as a great surprise, the sheer dysfunction displayed should serve as a wakeup call for those who still harbor any desperate illusions. Some members of Congress, such as John McCain, have even come out against the $1.2 trillion in automatic spending cuts that would go into effect in January 2013. Expect more politicians of both parties to cravenly follow suit.

Over the next decade, the U.S. government expects to spend more than $40 trillion. Even if the $1.2 trillion in automatic cuts are allowed to go through, the amount totals just 3% of the expected outlays. In a masterstroke of hypocritical accounting, $216 billion of these proposed "cuts" merely represent the expected reductions in interest payments that would result from $984 billion of actual cuts. These cuts won't make a noticeable dent in our projected deficits, which if history can be any guide, will likely rise by much more as economic reality proves far gloomier than government statisticians predict. Finally, the cuts are not cuts in the ordinary sense of the word, where spending is actually reduced. They are cuts in the baseline, which means spending merely increases less than what was previously budgeted.

In the mean time, the prospect of sovereign default in Europe is driving "safe" haven demand for the dollar. So contrary to the political blame game, Europe's problems are actually providing a temporary boost to America's bubble economy. However, a resolution to the crisis in Europe could reverse those flows. And given the discipline emanating from Berlin, a real solution is not out of the question. If confidence can be restored there, each episodic flight to safety may be less focused on the U.S. dollar. Instead, risk-averse investors may prefer a basket of other, higher-yielding, more fiscally sustainable currencies.

The irony is that Europe is actually being criticized for its failure to follow America's lead. This misplaced criticism is based on the mistaken belief that our approach worked. It did not. Sure, it may have delayed the explosion, but only by assuring a much larger one in the future. In the mean time, many have mistaken the delay for success.

this;

Finally, the cuts are not cuts in the ordinary sense of the word, where spending is actually reduced. They are cuts in the baseline, which means spending merely increases less than what was previously budgeted.

is what I have been saying and at the risk of going off Euro for a moment, in what nation in what universe is trying to cut spending in a country that already borrows 40 cents of EVERY single dollar we spend every single day an infamnia? why here of course...  

and his points on the EU unwittingly shielding us from inflationary blowback, as he alludes, this to shall pass, good Christ when they get their shit together, we'll be in for some hard sledding.

Some European nations, struggling to find buyers for their bonds, are pressuring their own already-stressed banks to fill the gap by acting as lenders of last resortin certain cases, pushing the amount of risky European debt on those institutions' books even higher.

Italy and Portugal, among other European governments, are leaning on their banks to continue buyingor at least to stop sellinggovernment bonds, according to people familiar with the matter.

Meanwhile, in Spain and other European countries, the quantities of loans banks are doling out to local and national governments have been rising sharply.

The pressure reflects mounting worry in Europe's financially shaky countries that, without buyers, their own borrowing costs will spiral out of control. At the same time it presents banks with a paradox: While investors and regulators want the banks to sell off their holdings of European sovereign debt, local politicians are twisting arms to make sure they don't....

Lackluster demand for the bonds could push the countries' borrowing costs into unsustainable territory. To make sure that doesn't happen, banks in each country are likely to face heavy pressure to participate in the auctions, experts say. Already, they are among the biggest holders of the bonds, accounting for about 16% of Italy's outstanding government debt securities and about 23% in Portugal.

The deep financial links between European governments and their banks have played a part in fueling the Continent's debt crisis. Banks across Europe are collectively holding hundreds of billions of euros of bonds issued by countries that investors fear are at risk of default. Worries about whether the banks are strong enough to survive losses on their government-bond holdings have ignited fears that strained governments might need to bail out their banks.

Investors have been punishing banks holding big portfolios of debt issued by countries such as Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. And regulators have provided further reason for banks to pare their positions. The European Banking Authority is in the process of calculating new capital requirements for banks, based partly on their holdings of risky government bonds. The more such bonds they're holding, the more capital they will need to protect against potential losses.

The situation has prompted many big lenders in Europe and the U.S. to rapidly sell down their holdings, which they accumulated in an era when the high-yielding bonds were viewed as virtually risk-free.

Yet as those pressures bear down on the banks, governments are running out of options for borrowing money and increasingly turning to their banks for help. That is further entrenching the kinds of financial ties causing heartburn among investors, regulators and policy makers.

When some European banks have begun selling chunks of their sovereign debt in the market, their governments have urged them to stop, according to people familiar with the matter. In some cases, the requests have persuaded banks to stop shrinking their government-bond portfolios, the people said.

"We know that if we reduce our exposure, we'll be killed by the Italian Treasury," a senior Italian bank executive said. Echoing other people familiar with the matter, the executive described receiving phone calls from Treasury officials exerting "friendly pressure" after his bank unloaded some Italian government bonds....

Some governments are approaching banks for loans to finance their day-to-day operations.

In Spain, bank loans to the public sector increased 14% in the first nine months of the year, reaching a record of 87 billion, according to the Bank of Spain. It's the only loan segment that's growing, and it came as overall lending fell 2.6%, the sharpest drop on record.

Greece gets it's 6th bailout traunch of $7.7 billion.
 
 
..BRUSSELS (AP) — Officials in Brussels say eurozone finance ministers have approved an €8 billion ($10.7 billion) bailout loan installment for Greece.

Without the loan Greece would have run out of cash and been in default before Christmas.

The EU had demanded, and received, letters from the leaders of Greece's main political parties pledging support for tough austerity measures to get the loan.

The installment is part of a €110 billion ($150 billion) bailout package from eurozone nations and the International Monetary Fund that has kept Greece afloat since May 2010.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to divulge information while the meeting was still going on.

..

So, not official yet. Oooohhh, letters of support, I'll bet the German voters are appeased now. Can, meet foot.
 
 
 
It is increasingly clear that Italy’s public debt is unsustainable and needs an orderly restructuring to avert a disorderly default. The eurozone’s wish to exclude private sector involvement from the design of the new European Stability Mechanism is pig-headed – and lacks all credibility.

With public debt at 120 per cent of gross domestic product, real interest rates close to five per cent and zero growth, Italy would need a primary surplus of five per cent of gross domestic product – not the current near-zero – merely to stabilise its debt. Soon real rates will be higher and growth negative. Moreover, the austerity that the European Central Bank and Germany are imposing on Italy will turn recession into depression....

Secondly there is the problem of population ageing. The figures below show the transformation in Italys population pyramid between 1970 and 2030. In many ways Italys demography was at the most favourable point for economic growth (supply side) around 1990 (third figure top row) since the proportion of the total population in the working age group was at near its maximum, and the median age of the workforce was still relatively low. The point to get is that it isnt simply the level of debt that is the problem, it is the level of debt in the context of the implicit liabilities (in terms of health and pensions) which such population ageing represents, and the reduced growth outlook that having declining and ageing populations represents.

Yea yea I have seen that before and while I dont dispute the fact that Italy's population is getting older (all western industrialised nations are getting older), I do have serious issues with not only the people behind such reports but those that are promoting them. They more than often have a political agenda that would imply a gutting of the wealth fare state and a return to "the good old days" of the early industrial revolution with mass poverty, slave/child labour and so on.

It is all and well pointing out an issue like ageing populations, but using partisan debunked ideas of getting rid of universal healthcare, and the wealth fare state as a whole, is nothing but moronic.

As populations get older, things change. People work longer because they can or want or are forced too.. that is life. Also these demographic changes, the big evil used by especially the right to promote a political stance, are all based on the one fact that nothing changes in society from the status quo, and how realistic is that? It is the same bullshit with "muslim birth rates and the taking over of Europe by muslims".

But changing our societies in the drastic ways that some on the right want just because they hate the idea of UHC and helping people, is simply not going to happen.. it would mean a dramatic cut in living standards that would cause revolutions and wars. Those advocating massive changes are deluding themselves far more than Europeans who want and believe in the wealth fare state.

Wall Street Pushed Federal Reserve for Europe Action

Wall Street executives, in a private meeting with a top Federal Reserve official in late September, recommended a coordinated effort by central banks to remedy the European financial crisis, according to Fed documents received in an open-records request.

The meeting, led by Louis Bacon, founder of hedge fund Moore Capital Management, preceded a joint action Wednesday by the world's major central banks, which banded together to provide liquidity to the markets through cheap U.S. dollar loans.

The Fed already has a lot of toxic debt on it's balance sheet, adding still more debt from Europe seems like a step in the wrong direction. Unless the real truth is that the risks of contagion here is greater than what we're being told, or that we're closer to a global meltdown than we know. A part of me wonders if this is a political move to avoid a recession over there that could migrate over here and influence Obama's re-election chances.

So - we will make loans to them, which doesn't have to be approved by Congress if the Fed does it. Maybe we get paid back someday, all or part of it. Our dollar gets weaker, which means exports go up if we can find any buyers, but prices here also go up for the American consumer. They get to kick the can down the road a little bit longer, but the underlying problems still exist and have not been addressed. Does that about sum it up?

So - we will make loans to them, which doesn't have to be approved by Congress if the Fed does it. Maybe we get paid back someday, all or part of it. Our dollar gets weaker, which means exports go up if we can find any buyers, but prices here also go up for the American consumer. They get to kick the can down the road a little bit longer, but the underlying problems still exist and have not been addressed. Does that about sum it up?
 
recession over there? my man, 'theys be recessed',   the media has just not been making much of it and of course due to some cleverly crafted esoteric bullshit, formula they aren't 'officially' recessed...  

check this-

 

this chart tells me 2 other things aside from the naked numbers, 1) they are recessed   and 2) you don't need Panzers and a Lutfwaffe to be hated. I suspect Merkel is wrestling with that part of the German consciousness of guilt. And brother, I bet Sarkozy presses that button every chances he gets.

...America’s banks are reasonably healthy. They have significantly bolstered capital since 2008 and now boast core capital of 9% of assets, well above regulatory requirements
 
Well shoot!. If the FED had given me trillions of dollars in ZERO PERCENT LOANS, money that I could then lend back to the FEDERAL GOVERNMENT at 3% interest, I guess I'd be reasonably economically healthy, too.

Guess, now that the FED has given enough CORPORATE WELFARE to the US Banksters, they'll also have to make whole the US BANSTERS' VICTIMS, too.

Weird article.. almost as if it was written before the summit even started. Not much of what he writes is reflective of what actually happened at the summit or the actual facts of the issue.
 
 
Printing presses are now running full time to keep the EU a-float until they get a working united governmental budget structure with teeth in place. This will likely take them 2 years. There will be an awful lot of printing going on until then. The Euro-zone will now become a successive string of bailouts. It started with EFSF then global coordination of central bankers & next the ESM. The Euro-zone economies will weaken in-spite of the devalued Euro. Negative GDP for some EU countries.

the IMF has never been a 'pro growth' outfit. were they go, the 'sag' follows. look, raising taxes in say Greece or Italy, both of whom have HUGE underground economies is a non starter, aside from turning even more folks into law breakers as tax cheats and generating a profligate disrespect for tax authority and regulation, they won't realize half of what they claim on paper. Greece is already giving up on collecting taxes they have enacted.

Its the age old definition of insanity; doing the same over and over expecting different results.

They need to somehow some way, destroy the old paradigm of work regs rules and top down economic mgt. they have been using.

does any know for instance how a long haul trucker in Greece or Italy gets a license to do so? the gov. has a cap on the number of licenses it allows at any one time. the market in these licenses is like a taxi lic. (Medallion) in NYC. Its willed to family members or sold under ground from one person to another, no growth, no competition.

Want to open a pharmacy? If its within a certain distance of another pharmacy, nope, no dice. I could go on............but you get the picture.
 
 
 Niall Ferguson: Great Britain Saves Itself by Rejecting the EU - The Daily Beast 
 
 
 
Let's put aside the above concerns for a minute. When all is said and done, I am still amazed that the outcome of this summit is being described as a move toward fiscal union. It is not that - it is commitment to unified fiscal austerity, nothing more. Consider just a strict enforcement of the 3% deficit ceiling in light of actual deficits in the EU. Via NPR:

 

Just on the surface, it is tough to see any commitment to fiscal austerity as credible. Germany itself exceeded the targets in 7 out of the past 11 years. Talk about the pot calling the kettle black. France missed 6 in the past 11 years. And Italy 8 times. Thus, in addition to the periphery nations, the biggest economies in the Eurozone will all need to increase government saving to meet these targets.

Such saving will be attempted in the context of a recession in which the private sector also will be increasing savings as well. In other words, the public sector will be engaging in massive pro-cyclical fiscal policy as the recession intensifies. You have to imagine the end result is a substantial deflationary environment.

When hasn't Britain walked its own path vis a vis Europe?

This should be entirely consistent with the Brits character.

There is and was huge pressure brought by the usual suspects, academics, the Fabian elitists, Eurotrash set that wanted the UK to dump the Pound back then and they have not given up, they are applying the pressure on Cameron to cave right now. But the rubes didn't roll over then, who's laughing now?

and in GOOD times, Italy, since 2000 never got above 2% a year, so, no growth then. Now?   without it? the walking dead.

Hahaha, you must be dreaming that the Americans can pay the tab. In the real world it is the Germans that pay the biggest price for the European mess.

And who pays the bill when 3 American capitalists walk into a bar?

Answer: A Chinese communist
