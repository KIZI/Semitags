 
 
Snooki pregnant?
 
 
3 Months apparently.
Wonder how that will change things for Jersey Shore.
 
 
WHAT?!?!
HOLY SHlT... I FEEL BAD FOR HER CHILD.
 
 
I'm kind of looking forward to seeing what she looks like pregnant, in my head it's pretty hilarious.
 
 
Jersey Shore is my guilty pleasure. I hope they don't end it. But how could they possibly write a pregnancy into the story line? What about her and JWoww's show now? Waaahhhhhh!
 
 
she's going to be an even worse looking pregnant person than jessica simpson
 
 
I thought this was old news.
 
 
How will she stay sober for 9 months?
 
 
I can't believe it breeds.
 
 
she jumped the shark.
 
 
How great would it be if she was knocked up by the situation?

Uh, how about humanity???

LOL This was my very first thought as well!
 
 
Her appeal, for me, is her constant drunk train wreck behavior, this ruins that for me:( I do hope she has a healthy pregnancy, though.
 
 
I smell a publicity stunt!
