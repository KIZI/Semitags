 
 
is it true that....
 
 
the torys want to bring back tuition fees in scotland.

ive heard many people talking about not voting tory on this reason, but where is the evidence? could they even have the power to do so?

the scottish government pays the fees through our budget, and with joining up grammar school etc (*or so im told) so why would they have the power to do it?

and that "labour let it happen, but torys want them straight back?"

also, this would change our loan system surely, through a lot of people getting 915 pounds to live on... they couldnt expect us to do that with tuition fees in place? we would need a system more like the english, were they have a maintence loan of around 3000 each year (not fact, just from what ive read on here, could be completely wrong)

so.... true or false?
 
 
Not directly.

They will cut the budget of Scotland which make force the SNP to reverse it, much fun and games would occur if that happened!
 
 
Hope they bring tuition fees back in scotland. Why should the government pay for you to get into further education?

so, would the budget remain under a labour or lib dem government?
 
 
They could indirectly do it by cutting the scottish budget, or take back the devolved powers of the scottish parliament. Fingers crossed

Hard to tell, they havent mentioned playing with the Barnett Formula, but it might be like VAT 'there aren't any plans to'.

The tories have nothing to lose since they dont get votes in soctland anyway whereas Lib/Lab do.

It is unlikely that a Tory Government would over-turn any Scottish Parliament powers which have been defined over the last decade. This would simply be political suicide in Scotland for the Conservatives (if they were to make the next UK Government), without a referendum in Scotland //

But I'm sure David Cameron (if he is to be PM) would not step on Holyrood too much. The UK Conservatives have, for example, promised a White Paper on greater powers to the Scottish Parliament, in accordance to the recommendation of Calman. David Cameron has also publicly stated he would work with Alex Salmond.

i live next to a tory constituency...

the only one right enough...

but after this whole blowout of gordon brown, there may be more now.
 
 
I have heard nothing to suggest that they will or are planning to, they are the only ways in which they could do it though. I have no problem with the Scots getting free tuition fees as long as we dont pay for them.
 
 
It's a devolved issue, so the Tories will probably never be able to change it.

But frankly, if we're going to have tuition fees down here for the time being, I absolutely don't see why you shouldn't pay for further education north of the border.

Don't be daft, they can remove devolved powers or slash the budget. Either would do it.

Play with the bbc election seat counter  http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politi...10/8609989.stm 

they aren't going to win more than three seats in scotland, most likely only 2.

They can slash the budget, yeah, but there's plenty of other expensive SNP policies that could be slashed before getting rid of a votewinner like free university.

As for reducing devolved powers... if the Tories are unpopular in Scotland now, this would just be political suicide.

What have they got to lose? a couple of seats?

1 seat.

But still - it goes against the "Big Society" that Cameron wants by re-centralising previously devolved issues.

I'm working on them gaining a seat or two  

Thats true enough though. As an aside I cant wait to see how long it takes him to backtrack on the big society thing...
 
 
Yes they can, as everyone has said.

They will still get blamed for it.

Remember Mrs Thatcher wanted to cut central subsidies to local government, so that when the poll tax was brought in, its level would be in direct proportion to the level of spending in the councils, ie a big spending Labour council would have high poll tax, small spending Tory council would be low poll tax. She thought people would then hold their councils to account and oppose high spending, but the left wing councils just jacked up their spending proposals to push up the rate of poll tax, for which the Tories were blamed anyway.

Because we should all have the right to education? And for example HE in Poland is free (unless you go to a private uni).

But you can be educated, the english system is a perfect example, take out a loan and pay when you can afford it, simple. It would also stop some people like this guy i know doing "music performance" at the worst college i can think of. He wouldn't be doing it if he knew he would have to pay for it, he might be more inclined to do something that might benefit society and himself.

IMO there should be tuition fee grants. The rich would have to pay for studying at uni but those with lower income would be entitled to a grant. That would be fair.

If fees were reintroduced in Scotland it would be for people entering into 1st year after they were introduced. As with previous introduction of fees those already at uni won't be charged. I imagine if this did happen it would be in a similar manner to the graduate endowment as before, where they essentially add Â£x000 onto your loan once you graduate.

I also doubt that loans would change. I did my undergrad and had to pay the graduate endowment but they still only gave me seven hundred and something.
