Thailand's House of Representatives on Wednesday voted in favor to pass the
long- awaited Frequency Allocation Bill.

The bill, governing the establishment of the National Broadcasting and
Telecommunications Commission (NBTC), will be tabled to the Senate for
consideration on Nov. 15.

The joint parliament committee was set up to review the bill after the House of
Representatives rejected the version which had been amended and approved by the
Senate.

NBTC is required to replace the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC)
which is not authorized to allocate frequency under the 2007 Constitution.

Recently, NTC has opened the auction for 3G licenses but the Supreme
Administrative Court in September ordered NTC to put the auction on hold,
upholding the former injunction of the Central Administrative Court.

The establishment of NBTC will help solving the bottleneck problem of 3G
licenses, Satit Wonghnongtaey Minister attached to the Prime Minister's Office
said.
