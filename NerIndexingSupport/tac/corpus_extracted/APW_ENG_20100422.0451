The Swiss Competition Commission has rejected a merger of France Telecom's activities in Switzerland with those of Denmark's TDC, saying it would give them too dominant of a market position.

France Telecom and TDC said they were "disappointed and surprised" by the decision to prohibit their planned tie-up.

The French company would have given (EURO)1.5 billion ($2.25 billion) to TDC for 75 percent of the combined merger of France Telecom's Orange and TDC's Sunrise.

"The company resulting from the merger would have created, together with Swisscom, a dominant collective position on the mobile telephone market," the Swiss commission said in a statement.

Swisscom is the market leader in the Swiss market. The regulators said it was better to maintain three players than reduce it to two.

It said cost savings from the merger would not have been enough "to compensate for the negative effects on competition."

France Telecom and TDC said they would "assess their available options regarding potential next steps." TDC said it was pushing back its earnings announcement for the first quarter while it decides what to do about the Swiss decision.

The combined company would have united 3.4 million mobile customers and 1.1 million fixed-line and broadband customers.

Swiss consumer groups welcomed the decision.

"The merger would have allowed Swisscom and Orange to dominate the market," the consumer protection groups SKS, FRC and acsi said in a statement. "The two big companies would have had little incentive to actively compete with each other."

TDC shares in Copenhagen dropped 3.29 percent to 235 kroner ($42.33). France Telecom shares were down 1.5 percent at (EURO)16.92 in midday Paris trading Thursday.
