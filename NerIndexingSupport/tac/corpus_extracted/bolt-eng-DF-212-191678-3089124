 http://www.opinionjournal.com/wsj/?id=110008382 

 
What can the Bush administration do to persuade Iran's leaders that their bid to develop nuclear weapons will exact an unacceptable price on their regime? What can it do, that is, short of launching air strikes?

Begin by shelving the current approach. For three years, the administration has deferred to European and U.N. diplomacy while seeking to build consensus around the idea that a nuclear-armed Iran poses unacceptable risks to global security. The result: Seven leading Muslim states, including Pakistan and Indonesia, have joined hands with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to affirm his right to develop "peaceful" nuclear technology. China and Russia have again rejected calls for U.N. sanctions. The Europeans are again seeking to sweeten the package of technical, commercial and security incentives the mullahs rejected last year. And that's just last week's news.

Today, the international community is less intent on stopping Tehran from getting the bomb than it is on stopping Washington from stopping Tehran. That's something the administration may not be able to change. But there are steps it can take independently to alter Iran's calculations. Here are four.

 Take the diplomatic offensive. "Western countries must push the internal conflicts inside the Iranian government," says Mehdi Khalaji, an Iranian journalist and visiting scholar at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.

Mr. Khalaji proposes that President Bush write an open letter to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, specifying the conditions under which the U.S. would be prepared to negotiate. By addressing Mr. Khamenei this way, Mr. Bush would bypass and humiliate Mr. Ahmadinejad, aggravate the regime's internal frictions and explain to the Iranian people why theirs is a pariah state.

"The administration could say, 'If you halt enrichment, we can negotiate. If you stop supporting Hamas and Hezbollah, we can negotiate. If you release the following political prisoners, we can negotiate. If you stop meddling in Iraq, we can negotiate.' This would provoke a controversy inside the government. Some would say, 'OK, we can give up on these prisoners. We can back away from our relationship with Hamas. And so on.'"

Mr. Khalaji also urges the U.S. government to recast the content of its Farsi-language radio station, known as Radio Farda. The station's programmers, he says, "misunderstand the young generation of Iran, which is very political. The quality is not appropriate for a serious audience. The news isn't professional the way the BBC is." Offering a serious journalistic alternative to the Beeb ought to be an administration priority.

 Target the regime's financial interests. "In many ways, the Islamic Republic of Iran has become the Islamic Republic of Iran, Inc.," says Afshin Molavi, the Iranian-American author of "Persian Pilgrimages." Between 30% and 50% of Iran's economy is controlled by the bunyad, so-called "Revolutionary Foundations" run by key regime figures answerable only to Mr. Khamenei. Hard-line Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, considered to be Mr. Ahmadinejad's spiritual mentor, controls the sugar monopoly, while former President Ali Rafsanjani is said to be the richest man in the country.

Since Mr. Ahmadinejad came to power, these ayatollah-oligarchs have been running for financial cover: Capital outflows from Iran surpassed the $200 billion mark in the past year alone. Much of that money has made its way to banks in the United Arab Emirates, many of which have correspondent banks in the U.S. "We are preventing financial transactions going to the Palestinian Authority because banks are scared they'll be hit by U.S. terrorism-financing laws," says a source who closely tracks the Iranian economy. "Why can't we do the same thing with Iran?"

 Support an independent labor movement. On May Day, 10,000 workers took to Tehran's streets to demand the resignation of Iran's labor minister. And despite last year's $60 billion oil-revenue bonanza, the Iranian government routinely fails to pay its civil servants, leading to chronic, spontaneous work stoppages.

Workers' rights got a boost in January when Tehran's bus drivers went on strike to demand the release of their imprisoned and tortured leader Mansour Ossanloo. In a state that bans independent labor unions, the strike was an unprecedented event, calling to mind the 1980 Gdansk dock strike that became Poland's Solidarity movement. That movement succeeded largely thanks to the support of Lane Kirkland's AFL-CIO, which in turn received funding from the National Endowment for Democracy. The same model needs to be energetically applied to Iran today.

"The neat thing about the labor movement is that wherever it goes, it's welcomed," says a source familiar with Iranian workers' groups. "It actually makes America look good."

 Threaten Iran's gasoline supply. Iran is often said to have an oil weapon pointed at George Bush's head. Rob Andrews, a Democratic congressman from New Jersey, notes the reverse is closer to the truth: Because Iran lacks refining capacity, it must import 40% of its gasoline. Of that amount, fully 60% is handled by a single company, Rotterdam-based Vitol, which has strategic storage and blending facilities in the UAE. The regime also spends $3 billion a year to subsidize below-market gas prices.

With Illinois Republican Mark Kirk, Mr. Andrews has introduced legislation calling for the quarantine of gasoline imports should Iran continue to flout Security Council resolutions. "If gas prices were to soar in Iran," he says, "the regime would be destabilized, the possibility of internal change would increase and the regime would find a way to back away from the precipice."

One objection: A gas quarantine may require the naval blockade of Iranian ports, which is legally tantamount to an act of war. Not a problem, says Mr. Andrews: "I think the development of a nuclear weapon in violation of an international treaty is an act of war, too."

It is stupid text.

Iran is not Ukraine or Serbia.It is more like bellorusia,strong economy,indepedent of west market, good moral, small repesion against small people, and very strong land army.Hard opponent to US army.
USA fight wars against small opponents which where destroied by economic war.Serbia,Iraq.Last big war was against Vietnam,and there where mass war crimes,even in Camboga,Laos than bu US bombers and there allies.

Don't think for a minute that the U.S. would conduct a land war against Iran like it was forced to in Vietnam.

Also don't think for instant that the U.S. would make the same mistakes it made in Iraq.
 
 
Thats not what the text discusses both of you, its actually talking about winning in the absence of war.

It talks about several internal turmoil scenarios and another scenario where they'd use UAE based company against Iran. UAE I think would at best for America declare neutrality and stay out of it.

The writer has some good suggestions. But he failed to understand how a regime like that works. It doesn't work like our government. It doesn't care about polls. It doesn't need to make its people happy by being nice. It controls thoughts.

The people are easier to manipulate when they do not have perfect or even easy access to information. There can be the biggest strike in Tehran history, but if people in other cities don't know about it, then it's still ineffective.

Also, 10,000 people marching isn't a whole lot. We had tens of thousands of illegals in Los Angeles marching, maybe more than a million on May 1st across the nation, it was on every single TV channel plus cable, no one cared.

The best way to defeat a totalitarian regime is to introduce the world to its people. Our best weapon is the internet. We need to get more information to them. Let them see how other people live. Give them a chance to compare.

Unfortunately, it's very slow.
 
 
A totalitarian state run on fundamentalist ideology, that preaches destruction of another race/ nation will only understand the steel boot up its prosterior, nothing less.

Sad but true...
 
 
Well J belive there is many corruption in Iran, but it is very hard to show people of Iran on it because there is no free media.If you take them gasoline it will only be one more proff for people that USA is devel as media say.
This is why J said that text is stupid.

There is another way to stop Iran nuclear program, and here is how:

1.Stop support terrorist in Russia. And get Russian pressure on Iran.
2.Convince China and India that their interests in Iran oil would be secure.Support politics of one China.
3.Convice countries in region that Iran is dangerous for them if it get A-bomb.
4.Force Israel and Palestians to make compromise about Jerusalim.
5.Create Palestian state.
6. Presure Israel to destroy its nukes.
7. Arm Iraqs army and police and pull your forces out.

Now USA have good cerdit to talk with Iran.
It have support of Russia,China,India,Europe and even neigbours of Iran.

Is this possible?
NO.

P.S. dont think that J am lover of totalitarian state.My opinion is that many USA allies are totalitarian states, and is sick.Because you fight against some totalitarian states and support others.

I think this list came straight from the Red Queen's pre-breakfast agenda.

MAD

Probably not a bad idea, except for the fact that there are too many less-than-rational people out there that control their countries.

They'd insist on having sole control of The Button.

Which is why other countries don't want them to have it to begin with.
 
 
if i lived on another planet i'd let them try it....
 
 
Frankly speaking attacking or destroying Iran wont serve any purpose as sooner or later some developing countries will have the nukes keeping in view the changing scenario. When the weapons manufacturing firms are offering some countries very handsome deals while the government is also backing them how can u expect that it will not create resentment among other countries.
Definetly after seeing the state of affairs in Iraq the plight of people of Afghnistan other weak counrties have no choice but to secure themselves by developing the nukes( although its not possible to avert any major miss evantuality).
Now if Iran is even destroyed would it be possible for Bush of any other leader to assure US people of security?? i dont think so as such policies had already created hatred against US and such a mindless act will further enhance it Which means more attacks on US citizen the mode of which may vary.
So now whats to be followed to refrain Iran from having nukes? Well! the US had already missed the train, UR people must ask the admin as to whr the hell wr ur intellegence agencies when Iran was persuing the nukes, if US had initiated its efforst in the initial stage it might not needed to think attacking Iran now. Now its too late. even US cant impose economic ban on Iran.
 
 
We're still in the initial stages. We're not even sure if the Iranians had even began the technical plans to build the factories to build nukes.
 
 
Isn't it surprising that Iran is not raising so much of a shindy as Iraq did?

That speaks for itself!
 
 
 
I don't see how that makes one a "totalitarian" state, but I agree it makes us stupid. That includes your country BTW, because you're doing the same stuff...

Welcome back and happy birthday  
 
 
Praxus,

Missed you and your theories.

Where were you?

Now don't give the usual comeback - If I told you, I would have to find a new hiding place!  

All of 18 now?

Happy Birthday!
 
 
 
What I quoted...

 

I don't get it - you are stating that you are supporting us though we are "totalitarian state", that you are not supporing us because of that or that we are supporting some "totalitarian state"?
 
 
 
Praxus,

Missed you and your theories.

Where were you?

 

Just needed to take a break from the flame wars and the other morons that permeated through this forum, and I'm glad to see that they are all gone as far as I can tell.

 
Happy Birthday!
 

Thanks.

"Us"? I guess you really didn't get it, sorry.   He said the US is a totalitarian state because we fight some totalitarian states, and support others. My statement in essesnce says every country does the exact same things, so if one is totalitarian, they all are. If we go with your region we can cite the fight against Facism, and then cite the support of China, for easy examples. You could probably come up with better examples being from there, but they should suffice. Get it now?

China!? I need a drink.  
 
 
I have some questions.

What right does the US have to fund dissident groups in Iran?

What right does the US have to tell Iran they cant have nukes when the US has thousands?

I could just imagine the anger we would have if we found out China was funding anti US groups in the US or if the whole world threatened sanctions if we did not get rid of our nukes.
 
 
 
What right does the US have to tell Iran they cant have nukes when the US has thousands?

 

You say that like it's only the US that does not want Iran to have nukes.
 
 
What right does the world have when it allows other countries to have nukes. I said the US because it is the only power that can really do something about it

What right do you have to tell us not to care which of our neighbors can incinerate 1,000,000 of our citizens?

I mean seriously, what kind of dumbassed argument is this?

...That are all based on stupid platitudes about the moral equivalence of nations.

So youre telling me its ok for your nation to attack or interfere with the internal affairs of other nations even if you are being 100% hypocritical while doing it? What we are talking about here is the right of a nation to provide for its own defense in anyway it seems necessary as long as it does not violate the sovereignty of another nation.

The right of US to have ICBMs and hydrogen bombs, the right of China to have a million man army, the right of every nation in the world to do what it sees fit to protect ITS citizens.

To say that Iran does not have the same rights and privileges as other nations in the world is immoral and will only cause more problems.
 
 
Might makes right.

We are mighty, they are not....so they do what we tell them or suffer the consequences.

PS: Don't hate the player, hate the game....LOL

So the Nazis were right to kill the Jews, the USSR was right to keep Eastern Europe, Saddam was right to gas the Kurds???

Come on man, if might makes right I fear for the future when the United States is no longer the top nation in the world and has to suffer from those stronger who feel the same.

You are comparing the United States trying to bar a terrorist state - whose stated wish and goal is the immolation of another nation, among other things - from possessing the most ghastly weapons known to man.....you're comparing that to Hitler, Stalin and Saddam?

I'm attack your "might makes right" comment, now you are trying to say that your view is based on the idea that Iran should not have nukes because they are a bad country. Make up your mind.

Whats your definition of a terrorist state? Is the US a terrorist state because it funded the Sandinistas* or Mujahadine*? Is it if it was involved in overthrowing the Iranian government and installing the Shah into power?

Unless you have unbiased and clear rules that say "you can only have nukes if you don't......... or do......." then you can't pretend Iran is breaking one.
Come up with a real rule, a rule that applies to every nation equally and then I could support you. But it seems to me that the US just does not want other nations to do what its doing, a perfect example of hypocrisy.

* = cant spell worth a darn

He made the "might makes right" comment.
I am the one who believes that Iran should have not have nukes based on their stated belief that Israel needs to be wiped off the planet.

A terrorist or rogue state is a country that believes another country needs to be wiped off the planet, using whatever means are available. Including funding terrorism, or just good old-fashioned nuclear weapons.

There are lots of countries that don't like other countries and say lots of stupid things. You also can't ignore the fact that Israel was a country created by western powers and that there is a large problem with Palestinians and Israelis that has caused a lot of animosity towards Israel. I don't think Iran is rouge because apart from funding one side in the Arab Israeli conflict (The US funds the other) they really have not directly become involved in another nation, they have not attacked another nation, like our old ally Iraq did to them in the 80s, they have not bombed another nation with their air force like Israel. to call them rouge over not being fond Israel is like calling us rouge for trying to kill Castro and the bay of pigs

And those are the perfect countries to possess nuclear weapons I suppose?

"not being fond Israel" You really do have a gift for understatement.

The simple truth is that talk is cheap. Irans president can talk all he wants but he does not decide if the country goes to war and the country itself has not declared anything official in respect to their military aims involving Israel.
Recently China has passed a law that says that if Taiwan declares independence they can use military action. Does this mean that china can't have nukes?

Irans actions have not been to the point where they have lost their right to govern themselves and thus they have not lost the right to have those weapons.

Put simply, National sovereignty = ability to have nukes. Unless some peace treaty limits them like in the case of Iraq after the Gulf War or Japan after WW2.

But if that was not the case, then there would need to be a body that decides who can and cannot have nukes. But that body would not pass down that the US or Russia or China has to give up their nukes because the body would lose all credibility.
 
 
 
The simple truth is that talk is cheap.

 

Saddam Hussein made a lot fo "cheap talk" about Kuwait actually belonging to Iraq (amongst a lot of other cheap talk).
Osama bin Laden's stated goal was war against the United States. More "cheap talk".

China was a - relatively - stable country that wasn't ruled by religious fanatics when they aquired nuclear weasons. Their sabre-rattling towards Taiwan, backed up with threat of nuclear weapons (not neccessarily to use against Taiwan) is precisely why nuclear proliferation is bad thing.

 
Put simply, National sovereignty = ability to have nukes. Unless some peace treaty limits them like in the case of Iraq after the Gulf War or Japan after WW2.

 

Put too simply, I'd say.
By your reasoning, Argentina does not have a claim to national sovereignty. Neither does Norway....or Egypt....or Singapore...or Thailand...or Liechtenstein.

Might has ALWAYS made right.

It is the one truism of nature.

If you're stronger, you get your way. We're stronger than Iran, we want to keep it that way, so thererfore, it shall remain that way for as long as we wish it to.

"Superior firepower wins the day again, which is perfectly right and proper."

Welcome to the world of reality.

Which is an obvious fairy tale.
 
 
Unlike you I don't believe our purpose is to impose our will on other people. A person needs to try and make the world better, not worse. If America would rather be evil, fascist and survive rather then be moral, democratic and go down fighting to the end for its beliefs. Then I will have to find a new country.

Always an option!   Feel free to start looking right now. Cuba is close by.

I saw a film titled "Seven Days in May", when I was a cadet in the National Defence Academy (1963)!

It was a plot by the CIA and a part of the military (army and airforce) to depose the President of the USA and take over the country.

I suggest you get hold of the print and check it out.

It was a thrilling and a gripping movie that kept you at the edge of your seat!

However, the only problem is that they did not succeed since there were people who sincerely believed in democracy, no matter how bad it is!  
 
 
 
The simple truth is that talk is cheap. Irans president can talk all he wants

 

If he doesn't shut up soon, he may discover that talk is anything but cheap.

Look, There is not now, nor has there ever been, a rule book that dictates the actions of nations. Throughout history the rule has been: You may have what you can afford to take and hold as long as you can. (It is modern arrogance to view ourselves as more morally developed than our ancestors.)

As for imposing our will (The US) upon the world, whose will would you prefer? If you answer is: Nobody. Then you really don't know a thing about your fellow human beings. Ever since civilization reached the point at which groups of humans could act in concert aggressing against their neighbors, the will of the stronger has been imposed upon the weaker. When you pray tonight, thank God that it's a nation as essentially good as the US that has that strength right now. We're not a "nice guy", no country ever is, but we play well with those who play well with us. ANY nation other than the US would have done far worse than we ever will.

Have you ever thought that the thing that we are trying, in the long run, to impose on the world is "peace"? We're going to shove globalization of the world's economy down everyone's throat while we've got the chance, and in 40 years everybody will be glad we did.
 
 
Interesting how the US 'imposes it will' when countries seek to acquire weapons which can annihilate cities of tens of thousands of people. Russia and US had that ability 50 years ago and mandkind doesn't need any more countries that can do the same. They're trying to join in a game that was over a long time ago.

Proliferation of nuclear weapons must be stopped. The price to pay later won't be too high it will be bankruptcy, and not just for the US. If the various regional powers turn a blind eye to nuclear proliferation the human race is doomed. Wars aren't going to end and throughout history one can see reason has it's limits.

Mankind was damned lucky during the cold war that the two Super Powers blinked and looked at the big picture (MAD). Both we're able to listen to reason and hadn't forgotten the utter horror of war. How quickly people and newer generations forget may be mankind's undoing.

I'm tired of hearing about how the US imposes itself upon others and how much of a bully it is. Someone open a history book please and learn from it! Many times the US has tried to lay back or stay out of the way only to get pulled in because across the lake mankind is doing down right evil to one another.

As has been stated by others before on this forum: The US & allies are the only thing stopping the world from complete anarchy and mayhem. We didn't ask for the job and we don't want it but that doesn't change reality of geopolitics.  
 
 
Well said Drez and InfiniteDreams  
 
 
Yes, HEAR, HEAR!!!  
 
 
 
What right does the US have to tell Iran they can’t have nukes when the US has thousands?

 

Maybe because Iran signed a little treaty called the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which prohibits them from developing nukes. If you sign a contract, do you expect it to be enforced?
 
 
 
If you sign a contract, do you expect it to be enforced?

 

Nah, trying to hold somebody to a written contract would be considered bullying.
 
 
 
Yep, China, and without citing any political support, just read the backs of your products to see where they're made.  

 

Nvm, we just constantly misunderstand each other.  
 
 
Iran has been offered every oppurtunity to have its own peaceful nuclear program as long as it does not retain dual use capability. Iran has refused this. Take this combined with the hardline islamic government and it doesn't take a whole lot to come the conclusion that they want nuclear weapons.
 
 
 
What right does the world have when it allows other countries to have nukes. I said the US because it is the only power that can really do something about it

 

Nobody should have nukes and until India, Pakistan, and North Korea stepped up, we were well on our way to dismantling our nuclear forces. I don't think neither you nor these nations have any respect for what a nuclear weapon really is. It is not a weapon of defense or symbol of national pride. It is a means to armegeddon nothing more nothing less. There is a reason they have not been used in combat since 1945. Anyone who has any kind of respect for them would want nothing to do with them.
 
 
I dont think millitary action would be a wise decision by the US to begin with considering how badly Iraq turned out.But I do think that by joining the European nations and the UN in direct talks with Iran,the US could somewhat increase the pressure on the iranian govt.

Conventional war or nuclear war, those look like our options.

I guess not...
 
 
Iraq sucks... and we should get the H3ll out of there just as fast as we can.

Of course, by"just as fast as we can", I mean when we've got everything going good for the Iraqi people.

Had you going for a second, didn't I?
 
 
Punk.

Freely elected govt does not in any way make up for the thousands of lives lost in Iraq.Its true that the ppl of Iraq have suffered opressionfor a long time..but what a huge cost they had to bear to break free from that? and arent they still paying..

and wasnt "WMD" the reason why the US went to war with Iraq in the first place..
Going into war with distorted information is never the best idea..
I doubt the US will get any support from other nations if they do decide on military action against iran..

Does doing nothing make up for the hundreds of thousands of dead in mass graves, or 4 million internally and externally displaced Iraqis? Your great peace was costing a lot of lives...

 
and arent they still paying..

 

They've been paying for hundreds of years, at least now there is a chance for it to end.

One of them.

Name even one war where things turned out exactly as supposed? Much of the world said they had WMD, Saddam didn't follow the terms of the cease-fire, and hostilities resumed.

LOL   So?
