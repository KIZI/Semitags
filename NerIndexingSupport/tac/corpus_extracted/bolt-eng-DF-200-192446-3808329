Husbands that beat and abuse their wives are not even real men. These people really are the scum of the earth.

 
"He also taped my mouth saying that he would give me some surprise gifts. But, instead he cut off my fingers."
 

What kind of sick and twisted person could do such a thing to his wife?

EDIT: I just read through the thread and saw people writing things I never even imagined would be posted here:

 
It was God's will, a woman should be in the kitchen preparing meals not studying, unless she is studying with a cook book.
 

You and all the other people making sexist jokes are just sick.

This woman actually had her fingers cut off !

How is that amusing in anyway???

I know people nowadays are so distanced from pain and suffering, but I didn't think people were this cold and heartless.

I'd say you guys are probably on par with those people that were making jokes about the victims of the haiti earthquake.

Seriously sick people....
 
 
Seems a lot of this kind of stuff happens on that side of the World Wide Earth.
 
 
Exactly that. A sick twisted person only could do this. Good to see she's still going to pursue her education.
 
 
Wow thats horrible!!! D:
 
 
I think it hurt his pride that his wife would be better educated than him
 
 
Pure evil. Marriage still means ownership to some of these savage feckers...in this century, I ask you!

Wow, I see this is super-offensive...I should be flogged!
 
 
Cut off his arms ?
 
 
 
Cut off his arms ?

 

AND his winkle  
 
 
Is this a warning to the females of TSR?!
 
 
That's absolutely disgusting. I hope the woman will still pursue higher education and live a comfortable life.
 
 
....No words for this
 
 
Horrible.
 
 
Tbf though she sounds quite stupid:

"He also taped my mouth saying that he would give me some surprise gifts. But, instead he cut off my fingers."

How gullible can you get? I doubt she'd make much progress with studying.

It's very sad though. Nobody deserves to have their fingers cut off.
 
 
That poor woman, what a despicable thing for someone to do to anyone!

So much respect for her trying her best to come back from it, teaching herslef to write left handed etc. I hope she continues her education, gets a great well paying job and a fantastic life.

She'd be laughing while he's still stuck in the gutter!
 
 
Absolutely disgusting behaviour! The only books she should be reading are cookery books.

By the sound of it I doubt she had much choice in whether he did or not, anyone capable of cutting their wifes fingers off is perfectly capable of forcefully taping her mouth shut.

I just read it again from the angle of her being forced to have her mouth taped shut, and now I see that she didn't say she believed she'd be given surprise gifts, just that she was told she would be. Fair enough.

Whatever the exact circumstance, he was clearly jealous and threatened!
 
 
thats just vicious

What an idiot, cutting fingers off for..studying. Stories like this make my blood boil
I'm from Bangladesh, and I can assure you most people are sane, and most of the people (who I know) are relatively more liberal compared to places like Saudi Arabia
 
 
He obviously wasn't aware that the technology exists for her to get a mechanical hand. Maybe she will someday.
 
 
I admire her so much for her determination to learn to write left-handed and continue with her studies. It's such a shame that in this day and age some people are still made to suffer treatment like this from people close to them. I don't understand how anyone could justify cutting off their partner's fingers no matter what they've done.  

I hope he's punished.  
 
 
Sad story  
 
 
How old does she look in the picture?
 
 
What a ridiculous thing to do. I just can't understand why you'd do that to your wife.

I mean, it's your wife. YOUR wife. It's like keying your own car.
 
 
That's disgusting. Authorities really need to take woman rights in the Indian subcontinent seriously (amongst other places)- even in India where the situation has ostensibly improved, the condition of women in the countryside remains utterly miserable.
 
 
[QUOTE=Amiro123;35361877]x [url]QUOTE]
She probably deserved it.
 
 
Women can't vote or drive in Saudi Arabia...nothing new there.

It says she's 21
 
 
Madness.

People are Sane-Er
Bangladeshi's are still very backwards and very narrow mined... Like how they wont work in Bangladesh because they have "Uncles" in the UK
But this story is just ridiculous, Mindset of men against women, and etc..
And truee, Not as backwards as Saudi Arabia
I remember when i went there, some local guy said if you steal they cut off your hands...
Wasss scared :L

Please say troll...
 
 
If these people do not encourage and incentivize their female population to pursue higher education and become more economically competitive their envrions will remain a complete basketcase and will be easily trounced by the likes of China.

Eh?
 
 
Disgusting. How is she supposed to cook for him now?
 
 
wtf that's disgusting

exactly, how can any country expect to advance if they are depriving themselves of half the talent that they have!
 
 
 
Eh?

 

The jokes on him for being a stupidly poor planner of revenge and hate.
 
 
Jokes on him, how's she gonna make him sandwiches now that most of her fingers are missing?

Less than 2 minutes and 1 neg already, that's awesome.
 
 
this is disgusting!

God will punish him, and I hope this is the minority of humanity.
 
 
what the actual **** is wrong with some people

they should dump his ass in prison and rape him repeatedly with a tire iron while pouring hot sauce into his wounds. heartless bastard
 
 
what a scum bag this guy is

If you're going to steal a joke at least credit the original writer.
 
 
Personally i would have cut the toes off to keep her in the kitchen. Who can cook with no fingers?

These kitchen jokes aren't funny here you dumb ****

I know you're just trying to fit in an be cool but seriously...work on your self esteem instead of ripping on helpless people who were victim to cruelty.

stupid retard

Yeah, no thanks buddy.
 
 
She should have done a BTEC
 
 
Oh frack it happened in bangladesh  
 
 
His **** should be cut off, since he clearly ain't a man.
 
 
 
Absolutely disgusting behaviour! The only books she should be reading are cookery books.

 

lmfao
 
 
What a disgusting and cruel thing to do. I really do wonder how governments or organisations can tackle this sort of insane behaviour.

On a happier note I recently found out a girl on my course is married and has two kids and got a 1st class in her first year of Uni ! Her husband has been encourging her to study. I respect her so much after hearing about her background, she didn't tell me herself which shows her modesty.
 
 
Oh god and he's from Bangladesh which is where my ethnicity lies. I've noticed a lot of men in bangladesh are very stubborn, cruel and yet deeply insecure kind of people. I'm not saying all men in Bangladesh are like that just a large chunk of men are.

Yes, Bangladesh is still behind compared to the advanced world
I didn't say there wasn't any over the top extremism, which is why I said Bangladesh was relatively more liberal

But why?

This is what I don't get. Surely a woman who is earning well and is fully self-sufficient and able to transition across multiple industries is preferable to a useless lump who deliberately avoids education/betterment and is a general drain on society? Why would any man really want to be married to a woman like that?

And how do these women who do not access education expect to compete on a global level with Chinese women and Western women?

Because if she gets a decent job and education then who is going to look aftrr their children - he (being a douchebag) doesnt want to, he will thinkc its not Islamic to let her work. if she becomes more successful then his ego will shrink and that's what he wants to keep inflated. Due to current societal attitudes he treats her like a maid or even slave. Have you heard about the acid attacks that happen in Bangladesh and Pakistani.... It's disgraceful and disgusting.

Not all bengi guys are arrogant, are fagol bro are fagol?

Nahh, There were these hugee escalators for the mosques, and basically Little local kids were messing about running up and down the "Handrail" thing at some point...

Some police offer, wielding an AK-47!!!!! came and smacked each one on the back and told em to go home or something...

I asked my Parents how come thy do that here... then well yeah :L

Im not saying they are all arrogant, read my previous post. I'm not fagol but most of the Bengali guys in Bangladesh are.

But ofcourse with the corrupt government, they are going to be the way they are, maybe Bangladesh as a country needs more help, to get themselves out of the 3rd world country. We've been an independant country for only 40 years, we are developing and as the country gets better so will the people inside the.

Why would you stereotype all bangali fwaa's? Thats just fagol.

Yes, I have heard of those attacks. It is a sign of a failing society. What if you ask these people very directly though:

How will Pakistani/Bangladeshi women compete with Chinese women and with Western women?

How are they going to answer that? And wasn't the Prophet Muhammed's first wife a business owner, and the prophet's employer? So why would it be 'not Islamic' to work? Can you just make things up and then justify it by claiming it is 'not Islamic'?

Can I say that going scuba diving is 'not Islamic' just for the sake of it?

 http://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/show...4&postcount=79  - Answered you already here. And no that's not how it works. Also, in pretty much all jobs in the western world your working in a mixed environment.

What an evil disgusting sick minded scumbag that deserves to rot in hell.
*******
 
 
oh the things I'd do to that guy...

but anyway if he's done this on some sort of extremist Sharia/Islamic viewpoint then surely a suitable punishment is to remove 5 of his fingers?

Just thinking because there was an acid attack in an Islamic nation a while back, maybe Iran? Anyway it was decided that she would be allowed to have him blinded by acid dripping into his eye(s) or something. Some sort of just desserts type ruling.
 
 
This is so horrible and callous. The fact that such thoughts actually cross the minds of some people and that they can take that step between thinking it and then doing it... *shudder*
 
 
How did the husband die? News didn't reveal if he commited suicide or if someone killed him.

Sadly, she didn't go through with it as she recieved a plethora of death threats and wide spread condemnation from degenerate Muslims, liberals and Amnesty groups

I have conflicting thoughts on the whole "an eye for an eye" thought process for the things these sort of people do...but in the end I feel people can appreciate the consequences of their actions more if they experience the same, empathy is putting yourself in their shoes. Some people cannot seem to empathise and thus they need to be forced to feel the damage they do. If you've never been hit with a bat multiple times then kicked once on the floor, you don't fully understand what you've done to them. You can imagine it hurt them, but unless someone attacks you out of the blue, overpowers you, and batters you until you're a trembling broken thing on the floor, you won't truly know the suffering of your victim. Knowing how much it pained yourself may make you think more seriously about your actions then just beating someone up because it's "fun", as many gangs of lads seem to do.
 
 
I just don't understand why some muslims think studying is wrong for girls, like I know a lot of elders who think it's wrong for me to go university next year to get a degree as their mindset is that girls should become a housewife.
And doing horrific things like that is disgusting!, both genders should be treated fairly instead of the potrayal that men are superior and have the right to treat their wife/daughter etc in any way they want. And the more violent a person gets the less empathy that person has leading to horrific circumstances and in some cases death. Muslim women shouldn't be treated like how they are in some countries.

Seriously sick people....

 

... and they call us stupid for attempting to wipe out their entire race? Pfft, when they grow up and adopt a proper form of ideology, then and only then shall we stop bombing and killing their countries. It is precisely for reasons like this, that I think people are more stupid now then they were 10 years ago.

Ironically, he works for the ****ing emirates! Bloody hell, is this guy on crack? His WIFE is higher studying thus potentially getting a better job, thus earning more money thus potentially being the gateway to a better life for them... obviously that stupid **** didn't want that... well

When he is in the gutter with broken legs, screaming for help, homeless and poor... believe you me, I will be the last person that hands him a wad of cash and gives him a house.

1. I'm sorry, who are you referring to by "their race"; the Bangladesh? As far as I'm aware there's no conflict between us and them and I'm pretty sure we've not been "bombing and killing" their country.

2. The actions of this one man can not be an accurate reflection of the ideologies of the country he lives in, or the religion he follows or the culture he is part of etc.

3. Also I'm pretty sure it's not in the culture of Bangladesh or part of the man's religion to cut off a wife's hand for studying, if anything both would most likely encourage the furthering of a persons knowledge not condemn it.

4. I agree, the man didn't think twice about the reasons for her studying (the happiness it brought her, the prosperity it would bring to their family and the better quality of life they could have had), he was just so blinded by jealousy and hatred.

I hope that brave woman will continue with her studies, acheive her goals and have a long and happy life with a husband that actually cares about her

I am fully aware that I was being narrow minded, and frankly I don't see why I got negative rep when he was the guy being an absolute prick. If I was in government, as much as I DESPISE corruption, I would of had him killed... see how much he likes it - stupid ****.

Lucky your not in the government then, eh?  

I could maybe understand chopping off his fingers as well so that he can understand the pain the woman's going through (eye for an eye and all that) but killing the guy? Isn't that slightly too far?  
 
 
The world just gets more horrible by the day

The problem with this issue is some cultures and religions in some way see this as socially acceptable the same way they would with honour killings and forced marriages.
