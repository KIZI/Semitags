If you go back and research, the Dims got elected on a promise to do
something about gas prices in '06.  Gas had already hit 2.50 with a brief
fling over 3 dollars in '05 when Katrina hit.

They did NOTHING.  Gas not only went higher, it soared to over 4.25 a gallon
here in the Chicago area even though demand really hadn't jumped up that
much higher.  That is what triggered this economic disaster.

Even the Great Nobama was sad that it had gone up so fast.  Not that he
doesn't want a return to 4 dollar gas.

But they have so many people fooled in the Blue States that they are getting
rewarded for screwing the American economy.

My solution:  Sell New England and New York to Canada, where they can enjoy
the kind of socialized medicine they want. (Sorry Hach, you're in the
minority up there.)  I wonder if we can throw in Wayne County, Michicgan?

Sell California to the Mexicans, they mostly own it anyway.  We paid them 15
million for it in 1848.  Maybe include Clark County, Nevada, too.  They can
keep their RINO governator.
