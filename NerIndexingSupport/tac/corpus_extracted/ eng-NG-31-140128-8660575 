... this team is becoming. Put 8 up front on D and they are absolutely
helpless. LT may not gain 500 yards this season.

Norv Turner shouldn't be fired... he should be killed. The O is so
conservative and predictable it's makes me long for FatBoy Friedgen to
return.

The D? Read and react? Didn't they have about 10 losing seasons in a row
playing that? Blitz on every down. The other teams are scoring at will -
except for the woebegone Bears offense - and at least you'd get the ball
back sooner.

Philip Rivers should be downgraded to a brook.

The Dolts - even with Gates - probably have one of the worst five rec
corps in the league.

S. Merriman. Boy talk about an ad for the effectiveness of roids. He's
been Giambi-ized.

Losing sched - they win. Next year they get a winners schedule they lose.

Man good thing the weather and environment in SD is so good or it
wouldn't exist. No jobs. Political corruption of Reconstruction
proportions. Highest cost of living anywhere - or close. Sports teams
from hell ... pods pissing away their season. SDSU has to schedule Miss
Mary's Finishing School for Amputee Girls to get a win ... and even that
didn't work last year.

Man I hope the weather is nice this winter because you guys are going to
be looking for something to do on Sundays.
