The game thread.

Predictions?

I say Saints by 10. I know that the spread begs to differ, but the Saints have home field advantage.

If the game goes sour, I won't be on the thread posting during it, as I am going to DVR it and watch it at the half, but I will come on here to get my just desserts after the game from Dude and all the other Viking Losers, I mean fans.

Time to go make some Gumbo and wish I was in the Dome right now.

Catch you guys after the game.

I'll take the Saints by 2.

I think it will come down to a Viking field goal in the waning seconds and they will miss it giving the Saints their first trip to the big dance.

Saints v Colts.
 
 
NFC North has always been my favorite division but I think it's the Saints' game.

I would really like to see the Vikings win they are my second favorite team.

And here to think that I used to like you....

 
 
 
 
 
 
I don't really care since the Boys are out.

But I think this one will go to the Saints, by 7 or less.
 
 
The bigger question is who do the Colts want to play to win the Super Bowl?

Favre vs. Manning will be a media orgasm for the next 2 weeks if the Vikings win.

Manning's hometown and father Archie's team vs. the Colts if the Saints win.

Either way it doesn't matter, but I'm thinking the Saints and home field will prevail.

Saints by 10.
 
 
Saints by 7. They'll defeat the Colts by 10.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

That guy is paid for a blow job.
 
 
My Prediction: The winner of this game will be the Super Bowl Champ.
 
 
14 up. Good game.
 
 
Peterson usually comes back like Godzilla after he puts the ball on the ground.
 
 
21 all now.
 
 
Peterson is giving me heartburn.
 
 
 
21 all now.

 

Excellent game.
 
 
 
My Prediction: The winner of this game will be the Super Bowl Champ.

 

Yeah, but your predictions suck and you are always wrong, so who cares what you think.
 
 
 
 
21 all now.

 

Excellent game.

 

I agree! I love watching games like this!

And I have a little soft spot in my heart for the Purdue boy.
 
 
It's even better when you don't care who wins.
 
 
another pick for favre in a critical situation.
 
 
 
another pick for favre in a critical situation.

 

He's hurt, and it looks bad.
 
 
They are really roughing farve up now.
 
 
 
 
another pick for favre in a critical situation.

 

He's hurt, and it looks bad.

 

he'll be back.
 
 
You don't know the half of it....Tavarus Jackson sucks ass.
 
 
oh fuck. he may not be back.
 
 
 
oh fuck. he may not be back.

 

No, he'll be back. Fox keeps cutting back to his poor wife though. (I think)

He can still throw bullets, he just can't take that many hits.
 
 
 
oh fuck. he may not be back.

 

Vikes have no shot without Brett IMO.
 
 
 
 
oh fuck. he may not be back.

 

No, he'll be back. Fox keeps cutting back to his poor wife though. (I think)

He can still throw bullets, he just can't take that many hits.

 

maybe they were just taping his ankle?

They need a football with Handles for the Vikes.
 
 
Huge challenge coming, looks like a TD to me...
 
 
 
Huge challenge coming, looks like a TD to me...

 

did he have control of the ball as it crossed the plane?
 
 
Thats got to be a TD. or I need glasses.
 
 
Challenge sucessful, TD Saints.
 
 
TD, but Vikings are only down by 7.
 
 
they gotta hold on to the ball, though.
 
 
This score would be a lot more ugly if Brett wasn't playing.
 
 
They don't start blocking for Farve, he won't be able to be in there much longer.
 
 
I have to hand it to him he's tough.
 
 
Look at AD finally showing up to play.  
 
 
another near interception.
 
 
Farve is bitching for flags, but all he is getting is licks.
 
 
ANOTHER fumble by the Vikes!!
 
 
Oh are you fucking with me?  
 
 
Berrian fumbled it, wow.
 
 
 You Tube 
  You Tube 
 
 
What a waste of a challenge.
 
 
Tough pick, Saints have never been to SB and Favre is unbelievable....
 
 
 
 
 
 
The bigger question is who do the Colts want to play to win the Super Bowl?

 

Get off my thread, you!
 
 
Short of a 7th fumble, they should tie it here.
 
 
And Brett pulls another rabbit from his hat.
 
 
TD petterson.

Farve looks dead on his feet.
 
 
I am loving this game. It's going to go down to the wire, if not overtime if this keeps up!

Both sides must be a nervous wreck, I know I would be if these were one of my teams playing!
 
 
If the Saints lose, it's their own fault.

The Vikings are like 4 down on turnovers.

And they just tied it up again.

Who's taking odds on an OT victory?
 
 
 
TD petterson.

Farve looks dead on his feet.

 

He has more than earned that $12 million this year, though with each passing play in this game, he's showing he deserves it.
 
 
They needa spray Peterson down with contact cement.
 
 
 
 
TD petterson.

Farve looks dead on his feet.

 

He has more than earned that $12 million this year, though with each passing play in this game, he's showing he deserves it.

 

This is the way farve looked in his last championship game.

He ended that with an INT in OT.
 
 
Great play by berrian.
 
 
For the Vikings and Saints Fans:

 
 
 
 
Great play by berrian.

 

He's definitely making up for earlier.
 
 
FG range for teh Vikes...Farve seconds away from the SB...
 
 
Time for one more play before the kick...
 
 
HUGE mistake by the Vikes, 12 men on the field, out of FG range...
 
 
Intercepted!!!!
 
 
I smell OT
 
 
Shit, i called it, just like 2 years ago...
 
 
Oh my god. This is going to OT.
 
 
I don't believe it.
 
 
You have got to be kidding me.

The Vikings are giving this game away.
 
 
another favre interception in a critical moment. It's like dejavu all over again. this is why he isn't in the top five.
 
 
If the Saints don't win this game, they need to leave the NFL.
 
 
Overtime, regroup guys.
 
 
Crucial coin toss...I call heads.
 
 
OOOOoooooVVVEERRRTIIIIIIMMEEEE
 
 
 
If the Saints don't win this game, they need to leave the NFL.

 

using that criteria, the cubs would have been banned years ago.
 
 
Vikings have 31 first downs, the Saints 12.
 
 
Oh damn.
 
 
Go Saints, end Favre's year says the Packer fan
 
 
Yards, 475 v 235.

They have killed themselves with turnovers.
 
 
Vikes have been trying to give this game away all day.

If the Vikes lose, Brett goes down as king choker.
 
 
40 yard return, just missed breaking it for NO...
 
 
Great game regardless of who wins...
 
 
Even though we won the toss, I hate the NFL's OT rules.
 
 
To be a Vikings fan is to be a masochist.
 
 
BTW, I am surprised Joe Buck can call this game with Brett Favre's dick in his mouth.
 
 
Saints 60 yds from their dream, can they do it?
 
 
 
To be a Vikings fan is to be a masochist.

 

how would this rate when compared to the vikings-falcons in 1998?
 
 
Viks need a 3 and out.
 
 
 
another favre interception in a critical moment. It's like dejavu all over again. this is why he isn't in the top five.

 

Rookie mistake for a 40 year old QB.
 
 
 
BTW, I am surprised Joe Buck can call this game with Brett Favre's dick in his mouth.

 

They say the same thing about Manning.

Hang on tight boys, it's going to be a bumpy ride.

Overtime for who goes to the Super Bowl. Couldn't ask for more from a fan who is just watching a great football game!
 
 
NO is playing VERY conservative.
 
 
Holding, Vikes...1st down.
 
 
 
NO is playing VERY conservative.

 

That's to say the least.
 
 
 
 
NO is playing VERY conservative.

 

That's to say the least.

 

That was a huge flag.
 
 
Vikes shoulda scored about 50 points by now.
 
 
WHOA!!!!!!!

Just missed a pick there!
 
 
Here's how the game will end. Vikings will stop the Saints, who will then fumble on the first offensive play, run back for a TD.
 
 
Saints are VERY lucky at the moment.
 
 
 
 
To be a Vikings fan is to be a masochist.

Dammit!
 
 
Thjat catch looked short.
 
 
4th down, Saints will go for it...
 
 
Paul Allen has been darn near in tears a few times in the last 10 minutes.
 
 
 
Here's how the game will end. Vikings will stop the Saints, who will then fumble on the first offensive play, run back for a TD.

 

Oh yee of little faith....

This is going to be some ballsey call, if teh saints miss this, all the Vikes need is about 25 yards for a game winning FG.

You don't want to keep giving Minnesota chances.

Your experience is BF - before Favre!!!
 
 
No guts, no glory, 1st down saints.
 
 
Wow!
 
 
Another review, its not set yet!!!
 
 
And Review again
 
 
fucking instant replay. spend half the time under that fucking hood.
 
 
C'mon. Let 'em play.
 
 
OH THEY STOPPED THEM! The ball came out and was behind the 1st down marker.

It'll be reversed.
 
 
Close
 
 
Call should be reversed. Ball came out, negating forward progress. He went down behind the marker.
 
 
It will be a 1st down...play stands.
 
 
And the Saints get the call, despite the fact they shouldn't of.

But I guess the refs wanted to leave the stadium alive.

And that will do it folks.
 
 
Flags!!!

PI for sure.
 
 
Ahhhh, Zander, I see you've not watched Favre too closely. LOL... He's the little girl with the curl. When he's good he's very good. When he's bad... he's Aweful. I still remember the 2006 Championship.
 
 
uncatchable.
 
 
Vikes are fucked now...
 
 
Wow, the refs sure are liking some Saints tonight. Two bullshit calls in a row.
 
 
Bad call. Uncatchable.
 
 
 
Wow, the refs sure are liking some Saints tonight. Two bullshit calls in a row.

 

Least right about now they have.

And Reggie Bush is still overrated.
 
 
Huge run stop, loss of 5...
 
 
Farve may not get back on the field
 
 
Game is just about ver now, 38 yard FG from here..
 
 
The chokemasters are back in town.
 
 
 
Game is just about ver now, 38 yard FG from here..

 

mitch berger
 
 
That was no catch.
 
 
TO< yet ANOTHER review...

The call will stand, he caught it...
 
 
I am not ready to concede..........yet!
 
 
 
That was no catch.

 

But given the last review by the Vikings and then the bullshit interference call, it will be ruled as such.
 
 
Guy's got a short range.
 
 
Catch.
 
 
Incomplete.

The ball hit the ground.
 
 
 
But given the last review by the Vikings and then the bullshit interference call, it will be ruled as such.

 

This.

I agree
 
 
Here comes the call...play stands as called.
 
 
Of course the ruling stands, three bad calls by the refs.
 
 
 
 
Incomplete.

The ball hit the ground.

 

I agree

 

But the Zebras don't!!
 
 
3rd and three...
 
 
His hand was under it.
 
 
Oh my.

Some lovin from the Refs, but even Paul Allen said it was not irrefutable. That's surprising
 
 
Congratulations to the team in black and white for winning the game with only 7 players on the field.
 
 
And here we go.........
 
 
OK, here we go, 4th down and its a 39 yard attempt...
 
 
Big kick coming up. CHOKE.
 
 
Fg
 
 
TO, freeze the kicker time...
 
 
never trust a kicker.
 
 
  I can't watch.
 
 
Miss!!!! Miss!!! Miss!!!miss!!!! Miss!!! Miss!!!miss!!!! Miss!!! Miss!!!miss!!!! Miss!!! Miss!!!miss!!!! Miss!!! Miss!!!miss!!!! Miss!!! Miss!!!miss!!!! Miss!!! Miss!!!miss!!!! Miss!!!

Is it 4th down and I missed it? wierd.
 
 
Choke choke choke!
 
 
Hartly 9-11 on the year, 1-1 in Playoffs...
 
 
DRILLED IT@!!!

Saints win.
 
 
Oye....
 
 
Yeah!!!!!!!!! Saints are going to the big show!
 
 
Watch out Echo here come the Saints.
 
 
And the Saints and the Refs complete their robbery of the NFC Championship game!
 
 
 
DRILLED IT@!!!

Saints win.

 

damn that was a good kick.
 
 
The Saints should thank their MVP, Brett farve.
 
 
Congrats Saints fans

- now you will lose to the Colts....  
 
 
saints win! saints win!
saints win! saints win!
saints win! saints win!
saints win! saints win!
 
 
 
And the Saints and the Refs complete their robbery of the NFC Championship game!

 

Amen. It's sad, though. I'll be rooting for the Saints, but the refs will be rooting for the Colts.
 
 
Oh thank God, I thought I was going to have to suffer for 2 more weeks of Favre mania. Now he can retire again.
 
 
 
The Saints should thank their MVP, Brett farve.

 

I dunno...Peterson sure did his share.
 
 
It was a damn fun game to watch.

Best 2 QBs in the game will be at the SB.
 
 
Possible. Depends on if the Saints are gonna be blessed in their first time there.
 
 
Well, congratulations to the Saints. I thought they were outplayed but teams that turnover the ball five times don't usually win games.

I'll be cheering for New Orleans, given what the city has gone through, but they will have it tough because I don't think Manning and the Colts are going to turn it over as freely as Minnesota did.

As for Favre, I would have bet that under almost any other circumstance, win or lose tonight, he would retire. He took a beating today. However, since it was his mistake which potentially cost Minnesota the game, I think there is a 50/50 chance he'll be back.
 
 
Didn't I predict Saints by 7 or less?
 
 
 
Amen. It's sad, though. I'll be rooting for the Saints, but the refs will be rooting for the Colts.

 

Of course, Forrest Gump is a favorite.
 
 
I blame obama!

This is how he played against the Gainst 2 years ago.

He should quit, but I bet he comes back.

He played pretty well most of the game today, but he made one brutal mistake. All he had to do was to keep running and give Longwell a chance.

But Minnesota would not have been there without him, so I can't be too mad.
 
 
 
I blame obama!  

 

ROFL... funniest damn thing said tonight.
 
 
 
Goddamn, I can't rep you again.

 

 

Maybe you can have Gunny go under the Booth Review and approve of something that is totally against the usual rules.  
 
 
What a great game. Better luck next year Vikes and fans.
 
 
Hats off to Brett though for playing in extreme pain and giving it his all. He's had one of his best seasons of all time, and he should come back next year.
 
 
GREAT GAME! Congrats to both teams, and Saints, we'll see you in Miami two weeks from tonight!  
 
 
That one was for New Orleans and Louisiana.
 
 
 
GREAT GAME! Congrats to both teams, and Saints, we'll see you in Miami two weeks from tonight!  

 

Time for the Echo/Geaux epic smackdown.
 
 
Woohoo! Screw you, Favre. Stay retired this time.
 
 
Okay, so I was close..

Congrats New Orleans..

I am so tickled to see them win an NFC Championship.
 
 
Sean Payton was used as a scapegoat by Jim Fassel, and resurected by Bill parcells, and now he's coaching in the Super Bowl.

Full circle.
 
 
And now Favre retirement talk can start anew.
 
 
BTW, my Canadian Football League team lost the Grey Cup because of too many men on the field at the end of the game. Now my NFL team gets a too many men on the field penalty at the end of the game to deny them the chance to play in the Super Bowl. You can't make this up.

I bet there's a lot of happy Packers fans right now.

Why should Favre QUIT? Seriously, statistically, he had one of the best seasons of his illustrious career. Adrian Peterson was the goat here, he had a serious case of the DROPSY'S.

Favre should come back !!!!!! Old Guys Rule!!!! WOOHOOO!!!

Yep.

IIRC, he still get's ten from Toro. But he would've received a hundred if the Vikes won.

And he needs as many as he can get.

New Orleans got physically beaten today. I can't see Indy turning the ball over as much as the Vikes did.

But hey, you never know.

Farve really took a beating.
 
 
Farve is on sports center now, he has welts on his forehead.
 
 
 
Colts have more talent on offense then the Vikes.

 

I don't know if I agree with that. I think that the Colts have the most talented player, but if you went up and down the roster, I think the Vikes are better.

But that one player is really, really, really good.

If you take Favre out, the Vikings are 10-6. You take Manning out, the Colts struggle to get to 6-10.

Colts recievers vs Vikes recievers...its not even close.

Petterson fumbles to much.

Vikes have better Defense.

Colts are still better then the Vikes.
 
 
 
The Saints leveled Farve all game long. I don't think Brees was even sacked.

 

He got sacked once. I don't think Favre even got sacked. He just kept getting drilled as he handed the ball or released it (or a few seconds after that).

Very true - two flags for late hits, one fine, and one hit the NFL office said SHOULD have been flagged.

Apparently late hits were just part of the Saints game plan.

But if you can't hang onto the ball - you're gonna lose anyway.
 
 
The Colts to win it!

The Saints's game plan was to get the ball out quickly so they could avoid the pass rush. However, that limited them to short passes for the most part. That is one reason why they had only 12 first downs during regulation time, 235 yards offense and 77 in the second half.
