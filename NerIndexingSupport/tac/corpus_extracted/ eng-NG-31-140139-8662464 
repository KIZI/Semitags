Saw an excellent game this afternoon in the Unibond Division One
North as Lancaster City defeated FC United of Manchester 2-1.

The attendance was a whopping 2,257.

I really must get back to reality and stand in a crowd of less than
200 again! What with 3,600 last week - feeling quite claustrophobic.

Droylsden v City next Saturday.
