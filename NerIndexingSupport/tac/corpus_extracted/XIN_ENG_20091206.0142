Chile and Colombia have signed a trade agreement on the export of Chilean
avocado to Colombia and Chile's import of Colombian tomatoes and bananas,
authorities said on Sunday.

The Chilean Agriculture and Livestock Service (SAG) and the Colombian
Agriculture-Livestock Institute (ICA) signed the agreement which said commercial
exchange of the goods concerned would begin in 30 days, the Chilean Agriculture
Ministry said.

"This is the proof of the work done by the government to continue expanding our
markets," said Marigen Hornkohl, Chilean agriculture minister, adding that "in
the case of avocados, we are in the second place as world exporters, which
encourages us to continue advancing."

The agreement was signed after last week's visit of the ICA authorities to
Chile, which was aimed at learning about the fruit production areas in southern
and central Chile, as well as the exportation control and inspection process
done by the SAG to vegetal products.
