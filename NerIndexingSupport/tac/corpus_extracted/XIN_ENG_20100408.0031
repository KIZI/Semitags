U.S. deputy chief of Mission Thomas F. Daughton congratulated on Thursday in
Beirut a group of over 320 Internal Security Forces (ISF) police cadets and
officers who graduated from the U.S.-funded police training program.

The U.S. embassy in Lebanon said in a statement that "the cadets were presented
with their completion of training certificates and encouraged to use their newly
acquired knowledge in service to the public."

It pointed out that "the graduating cadets were trained in a ten- week, state-
of-the-art program, taught by U.S. instructors and curriculum developers with
the assistance of Lebanese police and legal professionals."

Earlier, ISF and U.S. officials conducted a ribbon cutting ceremony for the
newly completed 7-million-U.S. dollars initial renovation of the Warwar Academy
in south Beirut.

The statement noted that "the renovations provide classroom space for 100
additional students, a modernized kitchen and improved dormitory space to
accommodate over 380 resident students during their training."

It also said "the U.S. government has been assisting the ISF in its development
since 2007 through several programs. This training program is part of the
ongoing 104-million-U.S. dollars commitment to law enforcement assistance
programs."

The U.S. embassy announced in March the graduation of the first class of ISF
cadets and officers.

On Tuesday, the U.S. government delivered to the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF)
shipments of weapons and ammunition.
