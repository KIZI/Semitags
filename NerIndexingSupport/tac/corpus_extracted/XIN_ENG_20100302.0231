The 78th Houston Livestock Show & Rodeo officially kicks off on Tuesday with
organizers hoping it could be the biggest moneymaker in three weeks.

In the Reliant Park, where all events of the rodeo to be held, everything looks
like scenes from the Old West as officials of the Executive Committee announced
the start of the of the 2010 Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo Houston.

Hundreds of farmers have brought their best cows, sheep and other animals to the
Reliant Center, participating the show in daytimes while riders are training
their skills as the best riders, preparing for the rodeo show in the Reliant
Stadium in the evening.

There are not too many visitors during the daytimes and most of them are
teachers with their pupils as well as parents with their children, fully or
partially dressed as cowboys or cowgirls.

Organizers expect the huge crowd will waves into the Reliant Stadium beginning
at the sunset when people get out of work and bring their family to watch the
rodeo and enjoy the country music.

"We are extremely confident we're going to beat last year," said Leroy Shafer,
Chief Operating Officer of the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo.

Last year witnessed all-time attendance record of more than two million, with a
total estimated economic impact of 344 million dollars in the City of Houston
and 427 million dollars outside the Metro.

The organizers, however, admitted that the best records depend on Mother Nature.

"We're watching the weather with bated breath," said Shafer, explaining that the
rodeo can sell as many as 70,000 tickets the day of a big weekend show, but only
if there are pleasant skies to greet the crowds.

The history of the Houston Rodeo dated back to 1932 when the first Houston
Livestock Show and Rodeo was held. Since then it became the biggest event of the
year in the City of Houston.

Ranked consistently as the world's largest rodeo -- in events, entertainers and
spectators -- and drawing top competitors searching for a piece of the world's
largest regular season purse, the Houston Rodeo is like the Super Bowl, New
Year's Eve and the Fourth of July all rolled into one. It is a true slice of
Americana and a good time for kids and adults.

The three weeks of Houston Rodeo competition is fierce, with riders competing in
traditional rodeo events in both roughstock challenges as well as team roping,
steer wrestling and barrel racing.

Beside the heated rodeo action, the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo also hosts
national and international superstar musical entertainers nightly for sell-out
crowds.

After a 4-million-dollar drop in income last year, the organizers are expecting
the 2010 Houston Rodeo to be their biggest moneymaker in history.
