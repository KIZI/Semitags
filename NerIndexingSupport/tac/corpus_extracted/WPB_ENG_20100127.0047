Steve Battista, 35, stands on the sideline as South Carolina prepares to take on
heavily favored University of Florida. The November 2009 game, in front of
79,297 fans at the Gamecocks' Williams-Brice Stadium and televised nationally on
CBS, was important. South Carolina is an Under Armour school. Florida wears the
Nike swoosh.

"This is why you do the deal, to be on the field with the No. 1 team in the
country," says Battista, Under Armour senior vice president of brand.

The Under Armour family roots for its teams, and leading the cheering is founder
Kevin Plank, pacing the sideline a few feet away.

The purpose of the gathering is to play a college football game, but the back
story is a marketing showdown, UA vs. archrival Nike. The more UA teams win, the
farther they advance, the more television exposure they get, the bigger bang
Plank gets for his sponsorship dollar.

The Gamecocks are wearing Under Armour's black camouflage jerseys with slogans
such as "Courage," "Integrity," and "Service " printed on the back instead of
players' names to honor veterans who were injured in the Iraq and Afghanistan
conflicts. The exposure is a big deal for Plank and his company, who clearly
think they have staged a marketing coup while contributing to a good cause:
raising money for wounded veterans by selling products at the game, on campus
and online.

The Under Armour logo is plastered all around. It's on every South Carolina
player, including their cleats. It's on South Carolina coach Steve Spurrier and
his assistants. It's on the giant video screen. It's on fans, photographers,
security officers and even the students serving Gatorade to the team.

The game starts, and Florida scores a quick touchdown. A rout may be underway,
but South Carolina drives 84 yards in 14 plays to tie the score at 7 all.
Florida leads 17-14 at halftime, a moral victory so far for South Carolina. The
Under Armour contingent is clearly pleased.

When the Gamecocks emerge for the second half, one of the coaches, a former
roommate of Plank's from Maryland, veers to the sideline, and he and Plank
exchange hugs and pose for photos. As the third quarter rolls forward, the Under
Armour staff takes heart that its team is playing Florida tough.

Battista recalls his 2000 job interview with Plank on the night before
Thanksgiving. It was in a Baltimore warehouse, where Plank had moved the company
in order to stay true to what he saw as the company's blue-collar values. He
also wanted to be close to the Baltimore Orioles and Baltimore Ravens  _  both
stadiums were located across the parking lot.

"I came back to my apartment that night and told my wife this is a guy who knows
how to make a buck," says Battista, a 26-year-old aspiring novelist at the time.
"More importantly, he knows how to win."

Battista becomes focused on the South Carolina-Florida game. It's dark now, and
South Carolina, down 17-14, is mounting an impressive drive. The entire South
Carolina sideline is silent and psyched. But when Florida intercepts a South
Carolina pass and scores a minute later, the Under Armour team sags. Then it
heads for the SUV and the airport.

Nike, at least on the field, has won the day.
