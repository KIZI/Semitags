I agree. I hate trolling, so I never post over here, but I agree that your
team deserved it. You played with desire and class, put your money where
your mouth was, and battled and won when you had to.

I hope you kick everyone's ass and win the whole thing!

Yeah, I can't believe I'm here too. Hope you guys get to the series and
crush the Skankees if they make it...

Wrong!  The Phillies are actually the superior team.  The Muts didn't
"blow it," they're just not all that good, whereas the Phillies are.

Whatever.  We went 1-6 in the last week. You guys went 4-3. You think that
makes u good????

Face it. We blew it. If we went 3-4, we win. If we go 2-5, at worst we tie
for both the division and the wildcard.

Good luck in the playoffs.

Dude,
the Phillies fans here will tell you I can be the ultimate anti-Phillies
fan, and still be a Phillies fan.

The CHOKIES(now I have to call them the Phillies) TOOK the division from
you.

You blew at least a 5 game lead TWICE in the last month of the season
because the Phillies SWEPT the Muts.

I didn't think they would do it, but give them credit, they  punched you in
the mouth and took your lunch. The difference being, this year, they didn't
let a smaller bully take it from them after they took it from you.

Well, coming from a New Yorker with class, which is indeed, a rarity,
thanks for the kind words. I never thought as a native New Jerseyan who
lives out here now, I would ever say that, but I do.

I hate the Spankees as much as you do and believe me, I used to be a
Spanks fan, not that I'm proud to admit it, but at least I do!

I don't think Randolph should be fired, but I think Minaya should be!

Thanks for a great season!

Good luck next year, from a Phils fan!
