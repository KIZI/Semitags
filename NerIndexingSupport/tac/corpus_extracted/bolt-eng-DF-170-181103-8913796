And with the current mentality of American Politics? It is of no suprise with Two paties so stuck on themselves and of ultimate CONCEIT.

My plan is to break that Conceit and appeal to the PEOPLE whom are working as hard as *I*... and JUST AS FRUSRTATED.

Good LUCK INDEED. Thanks.

Sorry bro, but you are wrong. Presidents can and have issued Presidential Proclamations and Executive orders since George Washington. They must be made public, well since Mar 13,1936 anyway, and they are subject to judicial review; but nevertheless the POTUS has the ability to issue them.

Painful because I can rarely watch a poor schmuck unwittingly, nervously and ineptly make a complete fool of himself to a large audience.

I can't even watch it in TV shows or movies, where the character does it. It's a little quirk of mine.

Now, if they are a complete asshole I don't mind. But this guy came across just as an uneducated rube too old to ever learn any better. Not a malicious asshole. So it was painful to me.

How to Run for Office of the President of the United States
By an eHow Contributor

Instructions

Things You'll Need:
Large constituency
Campaign volunteers
Campaign contributors
At least $150 million dollars
Run For Office of the President of the United States

1. Meet all of the following requirements: Must be a natural born citizen of the United States Must be at least 35 years old.Must be a resident of the United States for at least 14 years.

2 Gain a name for yourself in the political arena. This can be done by running for smaller offices (commissioner, city council, mayor). Work your way up the political ladder.

3 Gain notoriety and a public following within a certain party. Once you make a name for yourself it is easier to enter the presidential arena. You will have more contributors to your cause.
4 Run in your party's primaries and win a majority of electoral votes to be selected as your party's presidential candidate. If you are looking for a way to run for president that does not involve holding lower offices, continue reading.

5 Get your name on the ballot in all 50 states as an independent candidate. To do this you must have a petition in each state signed by a certain number of people (it varies by state). The number of signatures you need can vary from 2,000 (Minnesota) to 160,000 (California). It is important to get on all 50 states' ballots because of the electoral votes you need to win.

6 Get out there early in the election season. It is imperative to start acquiring signatures and getting your face out into the public eye early. Make sure everyone knows who you are by the time of the elections. You will probably need around 700,000 signatures nationwide, which if done early enough, may only cost you around $2.5 million dollars (for paying circulators).

7 Advertise. Create commercials to inform people of your views and why you're the best candidate. Pay to get the commercials on television. An effective advertising campaign will cost you around $150 million dollars. Following these steps, you can at least get on the presidential ballot of the United States. How you run the campaign will decide if you win or not.

Defense is one of many natural Causes of Government...

And one it is mandated to maintain for Liberty of it's people.

And it is one that never should be thrown around for political cause.

Otherwise it becomes meaningless and with it will follow the Liberty of the People it is designed to protect.

Politicians will prostitute Liberty for their aims.

I will never do such a dastardly deed.

Defense is paramount and non-negotiable to the aim of Liberty.

I have a question on the 2nd Amendment. I see this quote,

"So until or unless an individual shows themselves to be irresponsible regarding fire arms then the government has no right to bar you from owning one. It may be argued by some that buying or using a firearm without proper training may constitute a level of irresponsibility and just cause for not permitting an individual to acquire a gun until they have the proper training to handle it. That question and the process required to make such a determination should be argued and properly defined."

Shall Not Be Infringed means what it says. The word "irresponsible, bar, owning, not permitting, a determination," does not appear in the 2nd Amendment. It is that very insult that has led to thousands of gun laws. The founding fathers knew the world around them, that there was drunks, criminals set free, insane people, gun fights, etc., and yet they are very clear in stating, "Shall Not Be Infringed." You might want to sleep on that.

You can write laws to lock people away from enjoying the freedoms of gun ownership or freedom to rape or muder, etc., but you don't write laws punishing all men for the acts of a few. If criminals are unfit for society and the freedoms it offers, you keep them locked away until they are, if they ever are. You exile them, is an option, if any country will take them.

T, I'm not applying for a job on your PR staff, i just want to point out that you might want to amend the above statement.

The first bolded part sounds kind of socialist, you know, like "  worker's republic  ".

And the second bolded part, that's just downright fascist.

Let's take a look at the results of today's New Hampshire primary. With two of the 301 districts reporting, The T is in a tie with Santorum, Cain and Bachmann at sixth place overall with a total of... wait, it's updating... a total of zero votes.

This could get exciting, folks!

Now, with 68 of the 301 precincts reporting, all the major news outlets are calling the race: The T comes in dead-ass last with a projected total of zero (0) votes, garnering him an underwhelming 0.0% of the votes cast today. He finishes behind Romney, Paul, Huntsman, Gingrich, Santorum, Perry, three inactive candidates, two sets of conjoined twins, a dead cat, and a wad of belly-button lint.

Now on to the Palmetto State!!

I read in the paper this morning that the NH GOP thought they found one vote for The T, but they quickly discovered that it was a fraudulent ballot as it was written in crayon and signed on the back by our candidate.

Final results tallied. Seems there were a hanging chad or two that broke T's way.

 
 
 
he's still got a better chance than gingrich...
 
 
even cain won......sad
 
 
Campaign update: The T has been busy over the past several days. Today he held a rally for his supporters in a theater in downtown Charleston. His chief of staff released the following picture from the event:

 

Look at that turnout! Word is that his campaign is very excited about the prospect of equaling or even doubling his vote count from New Hampshire.

Interestingly, he still gave a 3-hour impassioned rally speech to the empty venue. Upon realizing there was nobody listening, The T was taken into police custody directly following, when he was found drunk and crying, masturbating to a copy of Common Sense on a city bench outside of the building.
 
 
I hear The T has strong support amongst Civil War reenactors.

Expect him to have a strong showing in South Carolina.
 
 
Im running too.and im ready for a debate.  
 
 
lets get it on.
 
 
How is T polling in South Carolina? Maybe he can save the party from Gingrich!
 
 
Dunno about The "T"ard, but I find it funny as hell that Colbert was polling better than Perry in SC just before he dropped out of the race.
 
 
Any word on how The T did yesterday in South Carolina?

After a lengthy calculation of all the votes, I will now update you on The T 's results in South Carolina and Florida.

All in, he received a grand total of three (3) votes. However, two of them in Florida had to be rejected because they were made by an elderly couple thinking that the ballot was the early bird menu at IHOP.

The race is tightening, folks! These results have shored up his position in last place and have put him within striking distance of the candidates ahead of him, namely a bent paperclip and a half-dissolved urinal cake. Keep the faith!

YOU aren't an American by definition. The only reason you are is that you were born here, and that's all.

If you were born here, you can still be a non-American?

Oh yeah.......forgot........Obama was born in Hawaii (a US state) as well as many other liberals and Dems have been born here, but they're not Americans......they're Socialists.

Might as well have been born in Russia, right?
