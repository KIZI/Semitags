Any concussion can be serious, Bell was knocked out last night, did not
remember being hit,  and I was guilty of being rather amused...and some

Sustaining his fourth concussion in four years with Charlotte, Wallace was
taken to a hospital. A team official said Wallace was suffering some
amnesia, but tests showed no fractures and no internal bleeding.

Wallace was released from the hospital later Friday, but did not accompany

Bell suffered a mild concussion after taking a Shaquille O'Neal right elbow
to the back of his head in the fourth quarter, according to Suns physician
Dr. Thomas Carter.

Carter said Bell was "knocked out cold for a few seconds," but showed no
adverse effects when checked after the game.
